                                                 Chapter 2

                                     COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The ACC command and control (C2) system is based on the principles of centralized mon-
itoring and decentralized control and execution. The result is a C2 mechanism which keeps the ACC
Commander informed of the current status of ACC forces while enabling the wing or group commander
to exercise control over day-to-day operations.

2.2. Operational Control (OPCON). ACC and AFRC are designated as the controlling agency for
assigned Air Force aircraft, while theater commands have OPCON of theater-based assets. Reserve Com-
ponent (RC) missions for nonmobilized assets are controlled through applicable ANG and AFRC C2 cen-
ters. In practice, responsibility for planning and executing ACC missions is routinely delegated to the
wing or group commander. The wing or group commander, in turn, exercises control of non-close-hold
missions through the command post supporting the wing. In the event that assigned forces undergo a
change in operational control (CHOP), responsibility for mission monitoring passes from the wing or
group C2 facility to the gaining command. Changeover will be accomplished IAW the pertinent OPLAN,
OPORD, or deployment or execution order.

NOTE:
For certain close-hold activities, security considerations may compel the wing or group commander to
shift mission monitoring responsibilities from the command post to another wing agency. The wing or
group commander will ensure procedures are established for the responsible agency to monitor mission
progress and advise the MAJCOM/DO and COMACC as appropriate.

2.3. Mission Monitoring. Except for selected close-hold missions, the ACC Command Center monitors
all ACC aircraft that move to, from, or between OCONUS off-station locations. Key components of the
ACC C2 system are the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) and the various C2 facilities at
theater and wing locations. When aircraft are deployed in support of operations and exercises, the Com-
mand Center may obtain additional information from situation reports (SITREP) and Deployed Status
Reports (DSR). The following mission monitoring procedures primarily apply to missions that are not
close-hold in nature and have not been CHOPed to another command:
     2.3.1. The respective unit command post tracks CONUS movements of their aircraft based on aircrew
     reports.
     2.3.2. Information on OCONUS movements of ACC aircraft is relayed to the ACC Command Center
     (DSN: 574-5411; commercial: 757-764-5411) via telephone notification from host wing command
     posts. The host wing command posts receive their data directly from aircrew or via the en route facil-
     ity's local command post.
     2.3.3. The following paragraphs summarize mission commander, or if none is assigned, aircraft com-
     mander duties with regard to flight reporting:
        2.3.3.1. Missions at Bases with a C2 Facility. Mission or aircraft commanders will ensure that
        at least 30 minutes prior to landing, the following information is relayed to the applicable C2 facil-
        ity: call signs, mission numbers, ETAs, maintenance status, and additional service requirements.
        After landing, the mission or aircraft commander will contact the C2 facility with ground handling
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                          21


     requirements and departure information. In addition, CONUS based crews operating OCONUS
     must keep their home station command posts appraised of all actual takeoff and landing times,
     projected takeoff times, and other related information. Home station command posts relay infor-
     mation to the ACC Command Post. These actions keep the ACC Commander appraised of the
     locations and status of OCONUS forces. When forces CHOP to another theater commander,
     reporting will be through theater C2 centers upon arrival in the assigned area of responsibility.
     2.3.3.2. Missions at Bases without a C2 Facility. Mission or aircraft commanders will report, as
     soon as possible, actual takeoff and landing times, maintenance status, projected takeoff times,
     and other pertinent data to the host wing command post or command center. Methods of commu-
     nicating this information include HF phone patch, DSN, and commercial telephone. Refer to the
     FLIP, Flight Information Handbook, USAF HF/SSB Airways and Command and Control Station
     section for guidance on mission reporting. Restrict HF transmission to operational traffic.
        2.3.3.2.1. Accomplish movement reporting when crew duties and safety permit but no later
        than 30 minutes after the event.
        2.3.3.2.2. If unable to contact ACC command post (applicable RC command post for ARC
        missions) or Deployed Tanker Airlift Control Center via HF/SSB, retain information for sub-
        mission via voice to the controlling CCC when contact is reestablished.
        2.3.3.2.3. Restrict HF transmissions to operational traffic, i.e., movement reporting, itinerary
        revisions, maintenance status, flight plan information, weather and/or aircraft emergencies, or
        other important flight information, as appropriate.
        2.3.3.2.4. If experiencing problems complying with these procedures, report problems to the
        next CCC contacted. The CCC transmits the reporting problems to the ACC command post
        (applicable RC command post for ANG or AFRC missions).
     2.3.3.3. En Route Reporting:
        2.3.3.3.1. En route reports are not required unless specified in an OPORD/OPLAN or other
        mission directive.
        2.3.3.3.2. Unless shorter flight legs dictate, when approximately 3 hours from destination,
        contact the destination, CCC, or if no CCC is available, contact the ACC command post
        (applicable RC command post for ANG/AFRC missions) via HF radio. Upon initial contact,
        confirm your arrival message has been received and update your ETA. If your arrival message
        has been received, no further information need be transmitted. If your arrival message has not
        been receiveed, pass the following:
            2.3.3.3.2.1. Mission number
            2.3.3.3.2.2. ETA
            2.3.3.3.2.3. VIP code. Transmit VIP and honmors code in accordance with FLIP planning
            document. Send the VIP code of each VIP on board.
        2.3.3.3.3. When within UHF/VHF range, contact the destination CCC with the following
        information, unless previously transmitted.
            2.3.3.3.3.1. Mission number
            2.3.3.3.3.2. ETA

                    to cause delay. Add the noun(s) that identify the affected unit(s) or system(s); that is,
                    hydraulic, UHF radio, radar, engine, fuel control, generator, etc. Further elaboration is
                    discouraged.
                    2.3.3.3.3.6.3. A-3 (Plus Noun). Major maintenance. Delay is anticipated. Affected
                    unit(s) or system(s) are to be identified as in A-2 status above.
                    2.3.3.3.3.6.4. A-4. Aircraft or system has suspected or known radiological contamina-
                    tion. Any additional servicing requirements.
            2.3.3.3.4. VIP Messages. Airborne classified messages originated by VIP passengers may be
            transmitted at the discretion of the aircraft commander.
        2.3.3.4. Close-Hold or Sensitive Missions. Command and control procedures for these missions
        will be outlined in the tasking directive.

2.4. Mission Commander. A mission commander will be designated when more than one aircraft or
crew is deployed away from home station for training, exercises, or other operations. The mission com-
mander should be a field grade officer. Mission commander duties include, but are not limited to:
     2.4.1. Briefing crews on local operating procedures.
     2.4.2. Coordinating with ATC, CCT, STS, range control, users, and others that may have an impact on
     the mission.
     2.4.3. Ensuring that DZs or LZs have current surveys (when necessary).
     2.4.4. Ensuring personnel have ample and adequate billeting, eating, and transportation arrange-
     ments.
     2.4.5. Ensuring maintenance personnel know of aircraft and fuel requirements.
     2.4.6. Submitting timely reports on aircraft movements (see paragraph 2.3.3.).

2.5. Aircraft Commander Responsibility and Authority. Flight Authorization designates an aircraft
commander for all flights. Aircraft commanders are:
     2.5.1. In command of all persons on board the aircraft.
     2.5.2. Responsible for the welfare of their crew.
     2.5.3. Vested with the authority necessary to manage their crew and safely accomplish the mission.
     2.5.4. The final mission authority and will make decisions not specifically assigned to a higher
     authority.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                               23


   2.5.5. The final authority for accepting any waivers affecting the crew or mission.
   2.5.6. Charged with keeping the applicable C2 or executing agencies informed of mission progress.
   2.5.7. Responsible for the timely reporting of aircraft movements in the absence of a mission com-
   mander (see paragraphs 2.3.3. and 2.4.).

2.6. Mission Clearance Decision. The final decision to delay a mission may be made either by the
agency with OPCON or the aircraft commander when, in the opinion of either, conditions are not safe to
start or continue a mission. Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the aircraft
commander. If the aircraft commander refuses a mission, it will not depart until the conditions have been
corrected or improved so that the mission can operate safely. Another aircraft commander and aircrew
will not be alerted to take the same mission under the same conditions.
   2.6.1. Diverting or rerouting a mission must be authorized by the commander with OPCON, except in
   an emergency or when required by en route or terminal weather conditions or facilities. In the event
   of an emergency or weather-related divert or reroute, the mission or aircraft commander must notify
   the controlling authority as soon as possible.
       2.6.1.1. The controlling agency directing the rerouting or diversion is responsible for ensuring
       destination requirements or facilities are adequate for the aircraft.
       2.6.1.2. The aircraft commander will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or aircrew lim-
       itations that may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission.
   2.6.2. When directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the C2 center agency will ensure the AC is
   provided existing and forecast weather for the alternate, notices to airmen (NOTAMs), and appropri-
   ate airfield information from the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR). If the planned
   alternate becomes unsuitable while en route, the AC will coordinate with the C2 center for other suit-
   able alternates. The C2 center agency will coordinate with customs and ground service agencies to
   prepare for arrival. The AC is final authority on selecting a suitable alternate.

2.7. Posse Comitatus. It is the policy of the DoD to cooperate with civilian law enforcement officials to
the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-801, Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, incor-
porates that directive and provides uniform policies and procedures to be followed concerning support
provided to federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement agencies. It establishes specific limitations
and restrictions on the use of Air Force personnel, equipment, facilities, and services by civilian law
enforcement organizations. Report all requests for assistance and coordinate all requests from civilian
law enforcement authorities through the appropriate command and control channels.

                                                 Chapter 3

                            CREW COMPLEMENT AND MANAGEMENT

3.1. Aircrew Qualification. Each person assigned as a primary crewmember must be qualified or in
training for qualification in that crew position, mission, and mission design series (MDS) aircraft.
     3.1.1. Basic proficiency crewmembers may perform primary crew duties on any non-mission sortie
     and on missions (including unilateral training, joint training and exercises) when receiving mission
     qualification training or evaluations under the supervision of a qualified instructor or flight examiner
     in their respective crew position.
     3.1.2. Mission capable crewmembers may perform primary crew duties on any unilateral training
     mission. For other missions, the unit commander must determine the readiness of each mission capa-
     ble crew member to perform primary crew duties.
     3.1.3. Noncurrent (NC) or unqualified (UNQ) pilots may perform crew duties only on designated
     training or evaluation missions under the supervision of a qualified instructor or flight examiner pilot.
     Both pilots must be fully qualified unless excepted by AFI 11-401, Flight Management.
     3.1.4. Other NC or UNQ crewmembers may perform duties in their primary crew position on any
     mission when under direct supervision of a qualified instructor or flight examiner in their respective
     crew position. In this case, the student crewmember and the instructor or flight examiner fulfills the
     requirement for one primary position.
     3.1.5. Unqualified personnel may occupy non-pilot crew positions during flight under direct instruc-
     tor/flight examiner supervision. The purpose of this familiarization training is to enhance crew esprit
     and to enable the individual to gain a better understanding of the crew concept. This training will only
     be conducted in permissive environments, and only when mission accomplishment is not impacted.
     3.1.6. Grid Navigation Requirements. Aircraft with magnetic compasses on missions north of
     70oN latitude or south of 70oS latitude, or in any airspace where FLIP en route charts denote compass
     indications may be erratic or depict airways, tracks, or navigational aids oriented to grid north (e.g.,
     Canadian Northern Airspace) requires a navigator certified in SCNS grid procedures. EXCEP-
     TIONS:
        3.1.6.1. Flights within Alaska.
        3.1.6.2. Flights on published airways using magnetic references. Destination and alternates must
        have published magnetic instrument approaches.
        3.1.6.3. Aircraft equipped with two or more operable independent navigational systems.

3.2. Crew Complement. Minimum crew complement will be as specified in the flight manual and Table
3.1. Only one LM is required on augmented basic crews if other crewmembers can periodically scan the
cargo compartment. The wing, group, or theater commander is the waiver authority for all other crew
positions above the minimum specified by the flight manual.

3.3. Additional Crewmembers (ACM). An ACM is one assigned in addition to the normal aircrew
complement required for a mission. ACM status granted under this paragraph is applicable only to ACC
aircraft.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             25


   3.3.1. Policy Governing ACM Authorization. Unit commanders may authorize ACM status to per-
   sonnel assigned or attached to the unit. ACM status will not be granted to personnel while on leave.
   Wing/group commanders have approval authority for personnel traveling on ACM orders to fly on
   aircraft under their control.
   3.3.2. Orders. ACM travel authority must be cited on the orders and include the crew position for
   which the individual is qualified. Travel orders which do not cite ACM authorization must be accom-
   panied by written authorization (letter or message).
   3.3.3. Logging of Flying Time. Flight examiners, HQ and group tactics personnel, and flight sur-
   geons log flying time IAW AFI 11-401. Other ACMs may log flying time only at the discretion of the
   aircraft commander.
   3.3.4. Briefings. The aircraft commander or representative will brief all ACMs on emergency pro-
   cedures and egress.
   3.3.5. Security Clearance. ACMs will possess a security clearance appropriate to the mission being
   performed.

3.4. Interfly. The approval authority for interfly of crewmembers on Rescue HC/MC-130 aircraft is
specified in AFI 11-401, Flight Management. In all cases, the crew will be qualified in the aircraft MDS
as well as any systems required to fly the mission. ACC and ARC HC/MC-130 qualified aircrews may
interfly like MDS aircraft IAW the ACC/ANG/AFRC memorandum of agreement with concurrence of
State Adjutant General and unit commander.

3.5. Scheduling Restrictions. In addition to restrictions listed in AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 9, General
Flight Rules, crewmembers will not be scheduled to fly nor will they perform crew duties:
   3.5.1. After consuming alcoholic beverages within l0 hours of mission reporting time, 12 hours of
   alert, or when under the influence of alcohol.
   3.5.2. Within 24 hours after being administered anesthetics for dental or surgical procedures. Flight
   surgeons may authorize shorter periods of not less than 8 hours.
   3.5.3. When taking oral or injected medication, unless an individual medical waiver has been granted
   by HQ ACC/SG. Mild analgesics such as aspirin and aspirin substitute may be used without prescrip-
   tion when the underlying illness is not cause for grounding. Dexedrine or similar stimulant pep pills
   will not be used unless authorized by HQ ACC/SG.

3.6. Crew Rest. The minimum crew rest period is 12 hours. Infringement of the crew rest period will
effect the start of another 12-hour inviolate crew rest period.
   3.6.1. Do not give crewmembers less than 12 hours crew rest without OG/CC or theater commander
   approval.
   3.6.2. All primary and deadhead crewmembers departing on missions scheduled to be away from
   home station or rotational base for more than 16 hours or recover away from home station should be
   notified 24 hours before reporting for the mission. The first 12 hours are not considered crew rest, but
   are designed to allow crewmembers time to resolve personal affairs. During these first 12 hours, a
   crewmember may perform limited non-flying duties. The second 12-hour period is inviolate crew
   rest. (Reserve Component will comply with AFI 11-202V3, as supplemented by ANG or AFRC.)
26                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


     3.6.3. En Route Ground Time and Crew Rest. Normal ground time at en route stations is 15 hours
     and 15 minutes for crews alerted by CCC. Self alerting crews will receive 12 hours of crew rest plus
     sufficient time to perform mission planning and preflight duties as determined by the aircraft com-
     mander. (Reserve Component will comply with AFI 11-202V3, as supplemented by ANG or AFRC.)
     3.6.4. For crews on alert, crewmembers will enter crew rest 12 hours prior to the start of the alert win-
     dow.
     3.6.5. Standby crews will be given 12 hours crew rest prior to the earliest anticipated show time.
     3.6.6. If the aircraft is not capable of being airborne within 4 hours of scheduled departure time, the
     aircrew will be returned to crew rest or released from the flight (not applicable to ARC). Provide 2
     hours minimum for aircraft preflight and stations time within the 4 hours. Exceptions will be deter-
     mined by the aircraft commander. Self-alerting crews will reenter crew rest when directed by the air-
     craft commander. This paragraph applies to all missions, including unit training missions.
     3.6.7. Flying Crew Chief Work and Rest Plan. The crew chief is responsible to the AC. The AC,
     in conjunction with the en route station chief of maintenance, will determine how long the crew chief
     can safely perform aircraft recovery actions. The crew chief must have the opportunity to sleep 8
     hours in each 24-hour period. See AFI 21-101, Maintenance Operations and Management Policy, for
     detailed guidance.
     3.6.8. Postmission crew rest begins upon the final return of an individual to home station and runs
     continuously until completed. Postmission crew rest must be completed before starting the 12-hour
     predeparture crew rest period for a subsequent mission. Do not require a crewmember to get immuni-
     zations, engage in ground training, perform standby or squadron duties, or perform any other activity
     which would encroach upon crew rest. Waiver authority for postmission crew rest is the wing, group,
     or theater commander. Waiver requests for postmission crew rest are considered on a case by case
     basis only with the concurrence of the individual crewmember. Compute post-TDY crew rest at the
     rate of 1 hour off for every 3 hours of TDY not to exceed 72 hours (not applicable to ARC and to stu-
     dents in formal schools listed in AFCAT 36-2223, USAF Formal Schools).
     3.6.9. Post TDY Standown. Except in extraordinary circumstances, active duty personnel will be
     given 1 week (7 days) off for deployments of 6 consecutive weeks or more. Personnel must take leave
     if they travel outside the local area; be issued a pass IAW DOD Directive 1327.5 and AFI 36-3003,
     Military Leave Program, Section E; or remain "present for duty" with the duty location being at home
     taking care of quality of life issues that need attention due to lengthy deployments. The unit com-
     mander will define the local area and the policy for "present for duty." Waiver authority is wing or
     group commander.
     3.6.10. Crew rest waivers approved for exercises and contingencies will be published in the OPORD,
     OPLAN, or CONOPs.

3.7. Crew Duty Time (CDT). CDT begins at show time. When crewmembers perform other duties
prior to flight-related duties, CDT begins when reporting for the other duties. Other duties include civil-
ian work for ARC crew members. CDT ends when all crewmembers have completed postmission duties
to include refueling, offloading, maintenance, etc. CDT will not exceed the crew duty day (CDD) limi-
tations below in 3.7.1.:
     3.7.1. The basic CDD is 16 hours providing no mission events, helicopter air refueling (HAR) below
     3,000 feet AGL, pilot proficiency training, or functional check flights (FCF) are accomplished after
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              27


   12 hours (16 hours for AFRC) and no Air Refueling or HAR at or above 3,000 feet AGL after 14
   hours. If the autopilot is not operational or its use is denied for more than 4 hours, the CDD will be 12
   hours (the use of altitude hold does not constitute use of an autopilot). If the autopilot fails after
   departure, continue to the next scheduled stop and then comply with the basic CDD limitations.
   3.7.2. The augmented CDD is 20 hours for all Rescue HC/MC-130s, providing no mission events,
   HAR below 3,000 feet AGL, pilot proficiency training, or FCFs are accomplished after 16 hours and
   no Air Refueling events or HAR at or above 3,000 feet AGL are accomplished after 18 hours. If the
   autopilot is not operational or its use is denied for more than 8 hours, the CDD will be 16 hours (the
   use of altitude hold does not constitute use of an autopilot).
      3.7.2.1. Crew changes should not be made immediately prior to performing critical phases of
      flight. Normally, 30 minutes prior to initiating the checklist for an event will allow the new crew-
      member time to get acclimated.
      3.7.2.2. Minimum in-flight crew rest facilities will be 3 bunks or litters.
   3.7.3. CDD length will be based on the mission to be performed. For example, if the planned mission
   duration is 15 hours from show time to termination, then a basic CDD is appropriate even if the crew
   is augmented. Once established, a basic CDD will not be changed to an augmented CDD, regardless
   of crew composition.
   3.7.4. Time spent traveling as a passenger on commercial or military transportation immediately
   before acting as an aircrew member counts as crew duty.
   3.7.5. CDT for flight examiners administering flight evaluations and not occupying a primary crew
   position will not exceed the augmented CDD for the design aircraft.
   3.7.6. Aircraft commanders may exceed CDD by up to 2 hours on a mission in progress. Comply
   with waiver authority in AFI 11-202V3. If this option is used, aircraft commanders must coordinate
   with command and control agencies so that downstream activities are not adversely affected. Mis-
   sions will not be scheduled to exceed the maximum crew duty days in this paragraph. Aircraft com-
   manders must carefully weigh all factors affecting their crew before electing to extend crew duty day.

3.8. Alert Procedures:
   3.8.1. Alert duty is defined as any period during which an alert crew is on call to perform a specific
   mission. Prior to entering crew rest, an aircrew will be given an expected alert time for the mission.
   (EXCEPTION: Rescue alert aircrews must be prepared to respond at any time during the alert
   period.)

NOTE:
Waiver authority for paragraphs 3.8. and 3.9. is MAJCOM/DO.
   3.8.2. Publish unit alerting procedures in the group supplement to this volume. Provide a minimum
   of 2 hours (except ARC at home station) from arrival at aircraft to stations time for crewmembers to
   complete preflight duties (if not previously preflighted).
   3.8.3. Alert personnel are those required to be on duty for the prompt execution of the mission. Alert
   crews will be readily available in a location which allows the crew to meet the required time to launch
28                                              AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


     from notification. Suitable facilities include adequate sleeping accommodations for the entire crew,
     unless at home station.
     3.8.4. The alert duty period will begin at a scheduled time which is determined by the unit/mission
     commander. Provide aircrew members an inviolate 12 hours crew rest prior to alert duty. The unit/
     mission commander will determine the length of the alert period, not to exceed 72 hours. Predepar-
     ture crew rest is waived for flight surgeons or medical technicians who are on alert duty for urgent
     aero-medical evacuation missions.
     3.8.5. The crew duty period will begin when the aircrew shows for flight duties. Crews may com-
     plete initial alert activities (e.g., transportation, briefing, preflight, engine run of their alert aircraft)
     without starting their crew day. This time should not exceed 3 hours. Alert response exercises that
     terminate prior to engine start do not start crew duty time when they occur during normal waking
     hours.
         3.8.5.1. A daily update briefing may be accomplished without starting crew duty time. This brief
         can include weather, local NOTAMS, latest FCIF information, special instructions, and any other
         appropriate items. The aircraft commander determines which crewmembers attend the brief.
     3.8.6. Flying the Alert Crew:
         3.8.6.1. CDT starts when the crew reports for any duty other than stated in 3.8.5. within the alert
         period.
         3.8.6.2. If the alert crew is launched and returns with CDT remaining, they may be launched
         again within the constraints of that crew day. Numerous circumstances may arise that affect the
         decision to replace the alert crew and each incident must be evaluated on an individual basis.
     3.8.7. The alert crew will not be used as a "preflight" or "engine run" crew for aircraft other than their
     alert aircraft, or perform other official duties (e.g., additional duties, commander's call, safety meet-
     ing, etc.).
     3.8.8. An alert crew will not remain in alert status for more than 2 consecutive 72-hour alert periods.
     The crew will receive 12 hours of premission crew rest between the first and second alert periods.
     Following completion of the second 72-hour alert period, the crew or crewmember will receive a min-
     imum of 24 hours crew rest prior to reassuming alert status.

3.9. Alert Aircraft. Maintain aircraft on alert status IAW the following:
     3.9.1. Park the aircraft in a designated alert parking area to expedite taxi and takeoff.
     3.9.2. Whenever operationally feasible, have a crew other than the alert crew preflight the alert air-
     craft. If this is not feasible, follow procedures outlined in paragraph 3.8.5. It is the intent of this pro-
     cedure to allow the alert period and aircraft preflight validity period to be aligned. This should
     prevent the need to update the preflight during the alert period.
     3.9.3. The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual alert missions provided the fol-
     lowing conditions are met:
         3.9.3.1. Alert requirements can be met with sufficient fuel to meet mission requirements.
         3.9.3.2. Communication contact is maintained with the primary controlling agency.
         3.9.3.3. Controlling agencies are notified any time the alert aircraft departs the local area.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                           29


     3.9.3.4. The provisions of paragraph 3.8.6.2. are followed.
     3.9.3.5. If maintenance actions are not required, the aircraft can be resealed for alert once the
     through flight inspection is completed. A new flight crew preflight is not required until the end
     (72 hours) of the initial preflight period.
  3.9.4. A DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Form F, will be prepared for the alert aircraft. Alert
  crews are authorized to prepare a TOLD card using the worst weather conditions expected for the alert
  period. Use the TOLD data for alert scrambles. If the alert aircraft is flown for other reasons, use
  TOLD for the existing weather conditions.
  3.9.5. When a preflighted alert aircraft changes, or an alert crew change occurs and the same aircraft
  remains on alert, the oncoming crew will, as a minimum, apply power to the aircraft and check appli-
  cable items listed in 3.9.5.1. through 3.9.5.8.:
     3.9.5.1. AFTO Form 781, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Data Record.
     3.9.5.2. Interior and exterior for proper configuration and special equipment.
     3.9.5.3. Fuel quantity.
     3.9.5.4. Survival and emergency equipment.
     3.9.5.5. Navigation and communication equipment.
     3.9.5.6. Liquid oxygen quantity.
     3.9.5.7. Hydraulic reservoirs and accumulator charges.
     3.9.5.8. Publications.
  3.9.6. Should the aircraft remain on alert for more than 72 hours, a complete aircrew preflight is then
  required.
  3.9.7. Once the aircraft is accepted for alert, the flight engineer will ensure an entry is made in the
  AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Report and Maintenance Document, stating as a
  minimum the date and time the aircraft was preflighted.
  3.9.8. Consider alert aircraft off-limits to all personnel except alert crewmembers. No maintenance
  may be performed on the aircraft without approval of the unit/mission commander. Upon being told
  to launch, the crew is required to check the area in which maintenance was performed, prior to flight.

Notes:
1. Unit commanders will determine crew complement for operational rescue missions. If
resources permit, commanders may add crewmembers to enhance mission accomplishment or
maximize training.
2. Dependent on mission requirements, squadron commanders or deployed mission command-
ers may authorize flights without a NAV and/or ACS on board if they are not required for mis-
sion accomplishment.
3. Only one ACS is required on an augmented crew if the final portion of a mission (beyond
the basic CDD) can be conducted without their performance of crew duties. They will be cred-
ited with flying time but will not be assigned crew duties.
4. Only one LM is required on an augmented crew if other crewmembers can periodically scan
the cargo compartment in lieu of a second loadmaster.
5. Two LMs are required for RAMZ (Rigging, Alternate Method, Zodiac) drops, airdrops
where both paratroop doors are used, and static line personnel or equipment drops over the
ramp.
6. Two LMs are required for simultaneous contact air refueling training.
7. Two LMs or one LM and another qualified crewmember are required if more than 40 pas-
sengers are scheduled to be carried (EXCEPTION: unit moves or contingencies). Both crew-
members must remain in the cargo compartment.
8. Only one LM is required for tactical missions if: 1) Using only one paratroop door for per-
sonnel or door bundle (less that 100 lbs) drops; 2) High altitude, non-static line personnel are
dropped from the ramp and door or paratroop door; 3) Dropping only SATBs.
9. During flare handling, if two LMs are not available, a crewmember in addition to the LM,
will be in the cargo compartment or ramp area to assist. This crewmember will be familiar with
the type of parchute flare being used.
10. PJs are part of the HC-130 mission crew complement for rescue missions involving
pararescue employment. At least three pararescuemen are required for a RAMZ deployment.
11. Scanners/lookouts may be used on NVG low level missions, if available. Scanners/look-
outs may be any NVG-qualified crewmember. The ACS may perform as a scanner/lookout on
opera tional missions if primary duties will permit, with the approval of the aircraft com-
mander.

3.10. Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP). MEGP status is granted to individuals on a
case-by-case basis who perform unique support duties directly related and essential to a particular aircraft,
aircrew, or numbered mission. These duties require direct access to the aircraft and/or aircrew during
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                           31


ground or flight operations. MEGPs travel in passenger status, but report through the command and con-
trol center to the aircraft commander. MEGP authority must be in the individual's orders or other written
authorization. MEGPs will be manifested and anti-hijack processed by the aircrew at the aircraft. They
are authorized flight deck seating with aircraft commander approval. Eligibility and authority for grant-
ing MEGP status is specified in MAJCOM supplement to AFI 11-202V3. Aircrews will comply with the
restrictions contained in paragraph 6.34.5. of this volume.

                                                  Chapter 4

                                COMMAND OPERATING GUIDELINES

4.1. Objectives. The ultimate objective of the aircraft maintenance team is to provide an aircraft for
launch with all equipment operational (Fully Mission Capable, FMC). Manpower limitations, skills, and
spare part availability have a negative and direct impact on accomplishment. However, under specific cir-
cumstances, some missions can be safely operated without all equipment being operational. Using the
following policies, the AC is the final authority in determining an overall status of an aircraft. Use the fol-
lowing maintenance identifiers to effectively communicate a status of an aircraft:
     4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). An item, system, or subsystem component essential for safe aircraft
     operation or mission completion will be designed Mission Essential (ME) by the AC in AFTO Form
     781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. Include a brief explanation of the reason
     for ME status in the AFTO Form 781A discrepancy block. An AC accepting an aircraft (one mission
     or mission segment) without an item or system does not commit that AC (or a different AC) to subse-
     quent operations with the same item or system inoperative.
     4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). Any discrepancies that are not currently ME, but may become
     ME (if circumstances change), are designated as MC in the AFTO Form 781A discrepancy block.
     Every effort will be made to clear the MC discrepancies at the earliest opportunity to the extend that
     maintenance skills, ground time, and spare part availability permit. If subsequently, in the AC's judg-
     ment, mission safety would be compromised by the lack of any component, he may redesignate the
     said component as ME. However, do not delay a mission to correct an MC discrepancy.
     4.1.3. Open Item. Discrepancies not expected to adversely impact the current mission or any subse-
     quent mission are not designated MC or ME. These items receive low priority and are normally
     worked at home station. Do not accept an aircraft from factories, modification centers, or depots
     unless all instruments are installed and operative.
     4.1.4. Engine performance, aircraft attitude, vertical velocity indications, altitude, speed, and heading
     instruments should be operative in both pilot positions IAW AFI 11-202V3. For instruments with
     both analog and digital displays, as a minimum the analog must be operational. (EXCEPTION: The
     radar altimeter may have either analog or digital operational.)

4.2. Policy. This chapter provides guidance on how to operate with degraded equipment. If the aircraft
commander elects to operate with degraded equipment or aircraft systems, coordinate mission require-
ments (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements, etc.) prior to flight with
the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not adversely impact follow-on missions. For Air
National Guard (ANG) or Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) aircraft on ANG or AFRC mission iden-
tifiers, coordinate through the Air National Guard Operations Center (NGB/XOOO) or Air Force Reserve
Command Center (HQ AFRC/DOOC).

4.3. Command Operating Guidelines:
     4.3.1. Pressurization and Air Conditioning Systems. Pressurization and both air conditioning sys-
     tems should be operational if patients are carried. If a system fails at an en route stop, the mission may
     continue (coordinate with the senior medical crewmember when patients are carried) to a destination
     with repair capability. Required en route stops are authorized. Brief passengers and patients on the
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                               33


   possibility that discomfort may be encountered. This is not required for low level missions if a rea-
   sonable temperature can be maintained.
   4.3.2. Electrical System:
       4.3.2.1. All engine AC generators for all C-130s should be operational prior to departure. If a
       generator fails at an en route stop, the mission may continue to a destination with repair capability.
       Required en route stops are authorized. If the AC generator is not equipped with a disconnect, it
       will be removed and the generator mount padded before flight. Local training missions may con-
       tinue after a generator is disconnected or removed and the mount padded, provided no other elec-
       trical malfunctions exist.
       4.3.2.2. An operative ATM or APU generator is required for unrestricted flight. If the system is
       inoperative, flight in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) is permissible provided no other
       electrical malfunction exists. The generator of the HC-130(H)N will be removed and padded prior
       to operation of the APU.
   4.3.3. Fuel System. The primary concern with inoperative fuel boost pumps or quantity indicators is
   fuel balance and wing loading. Degraded operation is permissible, however, flight crews must con-
   sider potentially trapped fuel and decreased range should further degradation occur. The following
   paragraphs provide guidelines for degraded fuel system operations under most circumstances.
       4.3.3.1. One pump must be operable for each external tank containing fuel.
       4.3.3.2. One main tank fuel indicator may be inoperative. Two main tank indicators may be inop-
       erative provided they are not symmetrical tanks or on the same wing.
          4.3.3.2.1. Verify the tank with the inoperative indicator and its symmetrical tank quantity
          using a fuel tank dip stick.

NOTE:
Ensure maximum outboard main tank fuel weight is not exceeded when stores of any kind are installed on
the outboard wing (i.e., refueling pods, ECM pods, etc.).
          4.3.3.2.2. At en route stops when engines are shut down, dip check the tank with the inopera-
          tive indicator and the symmetrically opposite tank.
          4.3.3.2.3. Begin crossfeed operation when the symmetrically opposite quantity indicator has
          decreased to 1,500 pounds (inboards) and 2,500 pounds (outboards). For HC/MC-130 tanker
          aircraft, start crossfeed operation when any main tank decreases to 2,000 pounds.
          4.3.3.2.4. Engine out training using the engine corresponding to the inoperative indicator or
          its symmetrically opposite will not be conducted during tank to engine operation.
          4.3.3.2.5. Maintain symmetrical engine fuel flow.
          4.3.3.2.6. Plan to terminate flights with a minimum of 8,000 pounds calculated main tank
          fuel.
       4.3.3.3. One external fuel tank indicator may be inoperative provided both external fuel tanks are
       checked full or empty. Both external fuel tank indicators may be inoperative provided both exter-
       nal tanks are checked empty. When an external tank indicator is inoperative and the tank cannot be
       visually checked empty due to foam modification, comply with the following prior to flight:
34                                         AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


        4.3.3.3.1. Check pressure with each pump in the external tank. If no pressure is obtained, the
        tank is verified empty.
        4.3.3.3.2. If pressure is obtained, ground transfer the fuel from the external tank. Defuel the
        external tank if unable to ground transfer.
        4.3.3.3.3. When unable to verify an external tank is empty prior to engine start, place the tank
        on crossfeed until no pressure is obtained. This will be completed prior to takeoff.
        4.3.3.3.4. HC/MC-130 aircraft with two external fuel tank indicators inoperative may fill
        external tanks to maximum providing fuel is transferred to a Benson tank with an operable fuel
        quantity indicator. Transfer from only one tank at a time. Transfer no more that 1,000 pounds
        at a time between an external tank with an inoperative indicator and the Benson tank to main-
        tain fuel balance.
     4.3.3.4. Both auxiliary tank indicators may be inoperative provided auxiliary fuel quantity is ver-
     ified.
     4.3.3.5. Both a main and external fuel tank indicator may be inoperative on the same wing pro-
     vided steps in paragraphs 4.3.3.2. and 4.3.3.3. are followed.
     4.3.3.6. For other than normal ground refueling/defueling operations and associated guidelines
     per this chapter, fuel will not be transferred into or out of a main or external fuel tank with an inop-
     erative indicator or its symmetrical tank except per paragraph 4.3.3.7. and the following:
        4.3.3.6.1. Fuel transfer into a main or external tank with an inoperative indicator may be
        accomplished during contingency or emergency fuel need situations. All transfers, under
        these conditions, will be coordinated verbally and visually with the pilot/copilot as a backup
        for lateral wing balance. Compliance with paragraph 4.3.3.2. and sub-paragraphs still apply.
        4.3.3.6.2. A reliable source of known quantity transferred must be available. This source can
        be either the (AR) gage readings or internal aircraft operating fuel quantity indicators.
        4.3.3.6.3. Maintain symmetrical tanks within 1,000 pounds at all times. If small amounts
        (4,000 pounds or less) must be transferred, then transfer up to 1,000 pounds into the tank with
        the inoperative indicator followed by an equal amount into the tank(s) with operative indica-
        tor(s). If large amounts of fuel must be transferred, then transfer 1,000 pounds into the tank
        with the inoperative indicator, then up to 2,000 pounds as needed into the tank(s) with the
        operative indicators, then up to 1,000 pounds as needed into the tank with the inoperative indi-
        cator to bring all tanks symmetrical, or continue up to 2,000 pounds as needed, repeating the
        cycle until desired fuel quantity and balance is achieved in applicable tanks.
     4.3.3.7. On HC/MC-130 tanker aircraft, fuel may be transferred from tanks with inoperative main
     or external tanks only if the receiver requires emergency fuel. In this situation, the following pro-
     cedures will apply:
        4.3.3.7.1. The fuel counter for the refueling pod being used must be operational to track the
        amount of fuel transferred.
        4.3.3.7.2. Transfer from only one tank at a time.
        4.3.3.7.3. Transfer no more than 1,000 pounds at a time between the tanks with the inopera-
        tive indicator and its symmetrical tank to monitor fuel balance.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            35


   4.3.4. Antiskid System:
       4.3.4.1. The antiskid may be inoperative for flight to a destination with repair capability.
       Required en route stops are authorized.
       4.3.4.2. A local training flight may continue once airborne if the antiskid fails provided the sys-
       tem is turned off. The mission is restricted to one termination landing.
       4.3.4.3. Assault landings are not authorized with antiskid inoperative.
   4.3.5. Landing Gear System. If a landing gear malfunction is encountered, only a full stop landing
   will be made. The discrepancy will be corrected prior to the next flight. EXCEPTION: If repair
   capability does not exist and a positive determination is made that further flight can be accomplished
   with the gear down and locked, the aircraft may be flown to a destination where repair capability
   exists provided the gear is not moved from the down and locked position. Required en route stops are
   authorized.
   4.3.6. Doors and Ramp System:
       4.3.6.1. Aircraft will not depart on a pressurized flight unless the door warning light system for
       the cargo ramp is operative.
       4.3.6.2. Aircraft will not be flown with a crew entrance door or crew entrance door warning light
       malfunction.
       4.3.6.3. Aircraft will not be flown pressurized with a cargo ramp lock malfunction. Unpressur-
       ized flight may be authorized with a cargo ramp lock malfunction when mission requirements dic-
       tate.
   4.3.7. Radar. Weather mode radar must be operative for flights into areas of known or forecast thun-
   derstorms.
   4.3.8. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). The CVR provides valuable information to mishap investi-
   gation boards and should be operational for all departures. If involved in a mishap or incident, after
   landing and terminating the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker.

4.4. Waiver Protocol. Waiver to operate with degraded equipment or waiver to USAF policy exceeding
this AFI may be granted on a case-by-case basis and only in exceptional circumstances. Waiver authority
is based on "who" has operational control and execution of the aircraft performing a specific mission. The
aircraft commander determines the need for a waiver and initiates the request.
   4.4.1. Local Mission (Executed by Unit OG/CC or Equivalent). Waiver authority for active duty
   units flying local missions is the active duty OG/CC or equivalent. For Unit Equipped (UE) ARC
   units, waiver authority is the OG/CC or equivalent.
   4.4.2. ACC-Directed Missions. Waiver authority for active duty and AFRC or ANG units flying
   ACC-directed missions (includes HQ ACC Operational Readiness Inspections) is HQ ACC/DO.
   4.4.3. Other Missions (Contingencies). Waiver authority is listed in the OPORD/Tasking Order,
   etc., or is the DIRMOBFOR (or equivalent) for the agency with C2 of the aircraft. Crewmembers may
   request additional assistance or confirmation from their home units or MAJCOM.
   4.4.4. ARC-Directed Missions (Executed by the ANG or HQ AFRC). The appropriate ARC head-
   quarters maintains C2 and waiver authority for ARC crews performing any ARC-directed mission
36                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


     prior to mobilization (except associate ARC units). Waivers must be obrtained from ANG/DO or HQ
     AFRC/DO, as appropriate.
     4.4.5. Non-ACC Missions. For user command-assigned aircraft according to AFPD 10-9 (e.g.,
     AETC, AFRC, ANG), waiver authority is the appropriate MAJCOM/DO, or as specified in MAJ-
     COM supplement.

4.5. Technical Assistance Service. The AC may request (at anytime in the decision process) technical
support and additional assistance from their home unit, MAJCOM staff, and maintenance representatives.
     4.5.1. ACs electing to operate with degraded equipment or aircraft systems (with appropriate waiver)
     must coordinate mission requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maaintenance
     requirements, etc.) with the controlling C2 agency before flight.
     4.5.2. If beyond C2 communication capability, the AC may deviate from this chapter according to
     paragraph 1.8. Report deviations (without waiver) through channels to appropriate MAJCOM/DO
     with 48 hours. Units must be prepared to collect background information and submit a follow-up
     written report upon request.
     4.5.3. When it is necessary to protect the crew or aircraft from a situation not covered by the AFI and
     immediate action is required. The AC may deviate from the MEL and this chapter. Report deviations
     (without waiver) through channels to appropriate MAJCOM/DO within 48 hours. Units must be pre-
     pared to collect background information and submit a follow-up written report upon request.

4.6. Supplements. Each MAJCOM may supplement the MEL (see Chapter 1).

4.7. Definitions (Specific to this Chapter):
     4.7.1. Home Station. Home bases of assignment for HC/MC-130 aircraft. Aircraft will not depart
     their home stations unless MEL home station reqquirements are met. EXCEPTION: During war-
     time, en route criteria will apply to all aircraft departures.
     4.7.2. En route. En route locations where C-130 maintenance repair capability exists. An en route
     station has the necessary skilled USAF (or USAF contract maintenance personnel), support equip-
     ment, and technical data available to accomplish most repairs.
     4.7.3. Local Training. A mission that departs home station to perform home station transition train-
     ing, or airdrop training, and returns in the same day.
     4.7.4. Off-Station Training. A mission that departs home station to perform training, as directed by
     the wing commander, without returning the same day. These missions will be supported by deployed
     home station logistics.

NOTE:
Off-Station Trainers are considered local training for the purposes of this chapter.

4.8. Navigation Systems:
     4.8.1. For flights in Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) airspace in the North
     Atlantic Region or the Composite Hawaii/Mainland US Route System, the following fully operable
     navigation systems are considered the minimum necessary to permit compliance.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                         37


     4.8.1.1. Self-Contained Navigation System (SCNS) Equipped Aircraft. Fully operational
     SCNS, to include the navigator's IDCU and either the pilot or copilot's IDCU.
     4.8.1.2. Non-SCNS Aircraft. Two independent sources of drift and ground speed, i.e., Doppler/
     DVS and INS, doppler/DVS and INS and GPS, or dual INS.
     4.8.1.3. Sextant and Sextant Mount. (Not required in aircraft with integrated GPS or dual INS.)
     4.8.1.4. Compass Systems. When two systems are installed, both should be operational. If one
     system fails, refer to the flight manual to determine what other equipment is affected. Two inde-
     pendent sources of heading, i.e., one C-12 compass and one aligned inertial system. The C-130
     standby compass is not considered a separate source for the purposes of this paragraph.
  4.8.2. For flights on all other Category I routes, the following minimum operable navigation systems
  are mandatory.
     4.8.2.1. SCNS Aircraft. Either independent doppler or independent inertial mode must be oper-
     ational, to include the navigator's IDCU and either the pilot or copilot's IDCU.
     4.8.2.2. Non-SCNS Aircraft. Doppler, INS, or GPS.
     4.8.2.3. Two independent sources of heading, i.e., one C-12 compass and one aligned inertial sys-
     tem. The C-130 standby compass is not considered a separate source for the purposes of this para-
     graph.
  4.8.3. Equipment listed in FLIP AP/2 for permitting compliance with MNPS is mandatory. Loss of
  any component before track entry requires return to a station with maintenance capability or refiling
  via specified routes.

   Addenda A, HC/MC-130 Configuration Mission Planning.

5.7. Aircraft Lighting:
   5.7.1. Use taxi lights during all taxi operations. Use wingtip taxi lights during night taxi operations
   (if equipped). Use landing lights at night in unlighted areas. Use the landing and taxi lights during
   night takeoffs. Use taxi lights in-flight any time the landing gear is extended unless reflections cause
   pilot distractions in instrument conditions.
   5.7.2. Use anticollision lights or strobe lights from takeoff to landing on all flights, unless reflections
   cause pilot distractions in instrument conditions or formation flights. Aircraft with both anticollision
   lights and strobe lights inoperative may continue to a base where repairs can be made.
   5.7.3. Formation and leading edge lights should be on in addition to the anticollision/strobe and posi-
   tion lights during operations below 10,000 feet. Landing lights may be used continuously during local
   traffic pattern training and during low altitude maneuvering in high density traffic areas.
   5.7.4. NVG operations may dictate that external lights be off, set to reduced intensity, or IR lenses
   used. Conduct training operations with reduced or no external lighting only within the confines of the
   designated restricted/warning or FAA-approved areas. When flying formation, lead (and number 2 in
   a 3 ship) will display formation lights with brightness set as required, and IR anti-collision light. Last
   wingman in the formation will display lights IAW AFI 11-202V3.

NOTES:

        1. Formations may vary lighting as necessary provided adequate visual identification of the for-
           mation is maintained.
        2. The term "reduced lighting" as used here means aircraft lighting that is set below the mini-
           mum required by AFI 11-202V3. This does not preclude use of the NVG training exterior
           lighting guidance contained in the expanded Low Level and/or NVG checklists outside
           restricted/warning area airspace. The light setting prescribed in those checklists meets AFI
           11-202V3 minimums.

5.8. Advisory Calls. The pilot flying will periodically announce intentions during departures, arrivals,
approaches, and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. Mandatory advisory
calls are: NOTE: The pilot not flying the aircraft will make these calls except those designated for any
crewmember.
     5.8.1. Takeoff. State "GO" at refusal speed or takeoff speed, whichever is lower. Any crewmember
     noting a safety of flight malfunction before hearing "GO" will state "REJECT" and a brief description
     of the malfunction (e.g., "Reject, number two engine flameout.").
     5.8.2. Altitude Calls:
        5.8.2.1. 1000 feet above initial approach fix (IAF) (or holding) altitude.
        5.8.2.2. Transition altitude/level.
        5.8.2.3. One thousand feet above/below assigned altitude.
        5.8.2.4. One hundred feel above/below assigned altitude to include minimum descent altitude/
        decision height (MDA/DH).
     5.8.3. Nonprecision Approaches:
        5.8.3.1. One hundred feet above minimum altitudes (procedure turn/IAF, FAF, MDA).
        5.8.3.2. "Minimums" at MDA.
        5.8.3.3. "Runway in sight." Make this call when the runway environment is in sight. This call
        will not be made until certain that obstructions to vision, such as fog, haze, low stratus clouds, etc.,
        will not subsequently obscure view of the runway environment.
        5.8.3.4. "Go-around." Call at missed approach point if the runway environment is not in sight or
        if the aircraft is not in a position for a safe landing.
     5.8.4. Precision Approaches:
        5.8.4.1. One hundred feet above minimum altitudes (procedure turn/IAF, FAF, DH).
        5.8.4.2. "Land." Make this call at decision height if the runway environment is in sight and the
        aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.
        5.8.4.3. "Go-around." Make this call at decision height if the runway environment is not in sight
        or if the aircraft is not in a position for a safe landing.
     5.8.5. Climb Out:
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             41


      5.8.5.1. Transition altitude.
      5.8.5.2. One thousand feet below assigned altitude.
   5.8.6. Descent:
      5.8.6.1. Transition level.
      5.8.6.2. One thousand feet above assigned altitude.
      5.8.6.3. One thousand feet above initial approach fix altitude or holding altitude.
      5.8.6.4. One hundred feet above procedure turn and final approach fix altitude.

5.9. Communications Policy:
   5.9.1. Aircraft Interphone:
      5.9.1.1. All crewmembers will monitor interphone. Crewmembers will notify the pilot before
      going off headset and advise when back on headset.
      5.9.1.2. Any crewmember seeing a 200-foot deviation in planned altitude, or deviations in head-
      ing, airspeed, or potential terrain or obstruction clearance problems will notify the pilot immedi-
      ately.
      5.9.1.3. During takeoff roll, the pilot not flying the aircraft will state "Go" at refusal speed. Any
      crewmember noting a safety of flight malfunction before hearing "Go" will state "Reject" and give
      a brief description of the malfunction.
      5.9.1.4. Do not discuss classified information on the interphone during radio transmissions.
      5.9.1.5. Classified interphone or radio transmissions will be recorded on the cockpit voice
      recorder if it is operating. Ensure the CVR remains on and running until the tape is clear of any
      recorded classified conversations.
      5.9.1.6. Non-aircrew members will monitor interphone or radio transmissions only when this has
      been specifically approved by the aircraft commander. The AC will brief communications policy
      to these personnel prior to flight. The AC must ensure nobody monitors classified information
      they are not cleared for, or transmits classified information over the radios.
   5.9.2. Command Radios:
      5.9.2.1. The pilot not flying the aircraft normally makes all radio calls.
      5.9.2.2. All crewmembers will monitor the primary radio unless specifically directed to do other-
      wise by the aircraft commander or other chapters of this volume.
      5.9.2.3. The pilot operating command radios will tell the crew which radio is primary.
      5.9.2.4. Pilots are responsible for ensuring emergency frequencies are monitored at all times.
      5.9.2.5. One of the pilots will record and read back all ATC clearances. The navigator and ACS
      will record the clearance and monitor the read back. This includes all transmissions pertaining to
      ATC instructions involving departure, en route, and approach procedures. Disregard this proce-
      dure when ATC instructions require immediate execution, or when such action interferes with
      timely completion of more important duties.

Section 5B—General Airland Procedures

5.10. Wind Limitations. Maximum crosswind limits are in accordance with flight manual limitations.
Remain within the "recommended" or "caution" areas of the crosswind charts for normal takeoffs and
landings. All maximum effort operations must fall in the "recommended" area of charts unless otherwise
approved by wing, group, or theater commander (NGB/XOO or HQ AFRC/DO).

5.11. Runway Condition Reading (RCR) Limitations. The minimum RCR for takeoff or landing is the
lowest RCR depicted in the appropriate C-130 performance publication for the maneuver being per-
formed.

NOTE:
When no RCR is available, refer to the flight manual for standard ICAO conversions based on general
runway condition.

5.12. Runway and Taxiway Requirements. Minimum runway criteria for normal, maximum effort, and
night vision goggle (NVG) operations are listed in paragraph 5.12.1. Use of non-hard surfaced runways
or taxiways requires group or theater commander approval.
     5.12.1. Normal Operations:
        5.12.1.1. Takeoff. Minimum runway length is critical field length.
        5.12.1.2. Landing. Minimum runway length is landing distance plus the following correction
        factors:
           5.12.1.2.1. RVR less than 40 (3/4 mile)--add 1,000 feet.
           5.12.1.2.2. RVR equal to or greater than 40 (3/4 mile)--add 500 feet.
           5.12.1.2.3. If runway length available for landing is less than required in 5.12.1.2., crews may
           use landing ground roll plus 1000 feet as minimum runway length, when approved by the
           Squadron/CC. In this case, you must modify the landing to touch down in the first 500 feet of
           runway.
        5.12.1.3. Minimum runway width is 80 feet or 25 meters.
        5.12.1.4. Minimum taxiway width is 30 feet or 9 meters.
     5.12.2. Short Field Operations:
        5.12.2.1. Takeoff. Minimum runway length is charted minimum field length for maximum effort
        takeoff. If runway available is greater than minimum field length for maximum effort takeoff,
        then correct for VMCA.
        5.12.2.2. Landing. Minimum runway length is ground roll plus 500 feet.
        5.12.2.3. Runway and Taxiway Width. Minimum runway width is 60 feet or 19 meters. Mini-
        mum taxiway width is 30 feet or 9 meters.
        5.12.2.4. When obstacles are a factor, use actual maximum effort speed (1.2 x power-on stall
        speed) and climb out at maximum effort obstacle clearance speed (1.3 x power-on stall speed).
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                       43


        5.12.2.4.1. When conditions allow, maximum effort takeoff speed will be air minimum con-
        trol speed (one engine inoperative in ground effect, VMCA) or computed 1.2 power-on stall
        speed, whichever is greater.
        5.12.2.4.2. If runway available is less than minimum field length for maximum effort takeoff,
        corrected for VMCA, then use actual maximum effort takeoff speed (VMETO).
     5.12.2.5. Training:
        5.12.2.5.1. Do not use runway less than 3,000 feet.
        5.12.2.5.2. Compute landing performance with 2 engines in reverse, 2 engines in ground idle,
        and full brakes.
        5.12.2.5.3. Liftoff speed will be air minimum control speed (one engine inoperative in ground
        effect, VMCA) or computed maximum effort takeoff speed, whichever is higher.
        5.12.2.5.4. Obstacle clearance speed will be computed maximum effort obstacle clearance
        speed or 10 knots above liftoff speed, whichever is higher.
        5.12.2.5.5. Simulated obstacle clearance height will not exceed 50 feet.
        5.12.2.5.6. Squadron commanders may authorize the use of actual maximum effort speeds
        (takeoff and obstacle clearance), on a case by case basis.
  5.12.3. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Operations:
     5.12.3.1. NVG operations may be conducted on conventional or short field runways. The runway
     available will dictate which criteria to use.
     5.12.3.2. Takeoff. Minimum runway length is charted minimum field length for maximum effort
     takeoff.
     5.12.3.3. Landing:
        5.12.3.3.1. Minimum runway length using normal procedures is IAW paragraphs 5.12.1.2.
        through 5.12.1.2.3.
        5.12.3.3.2. Minimum runway length using max effort procedures is ground roll plus 1000
        feet.
        WARNING: A go around point for blacked out runways will be identified during route study.
     5.12.3.4. Runway and Taxiway Width. Minimum runway width is 60 feet or 19 meters. Mini-
     mum taxiway width is 30 feet or 9 meters.
     5.12.3.5. Training:
        5.12.3.5.1. Do not use runways less than 3500 feet long.
        5.12.3.5.2. Minimum runway width is 75 feet or 24 meters, when any NVG landing pilot is in
        training without an instructor in the other seat.
        5.12.3.5.3. Liftoff speed will be air minimum control speed (one engine inoperative in ground
        effect, VMCA) or computed maximum effort takeoff speed, whichever is higher when maxi-
        mum effort procedures are being simulated.
44                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


            5.12.3.5.4. Squadron commanders may authorize the use of actual maximum effort speeds
            (takeoff and obstacle clearance), on a case by case basis.

5.13. Aircraft Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria:
     5.13.1. Without wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 25 feet; with wing walkers by at
     least 10 feet.
     5.13.2. Whenever taxi clearance is doubtful, use a wing walker. If wing walkers are unavailable,
     deplane a crewmember to maintain obstruction clearance.
     5.13.3. Use low speed ground idle when practical. If foreign object damage (FOD) is a problem, the
     outboard engines may be shut down provided gross weight, taxiway, and weather are favorable. Ver-
     ify all sources of brake pressure before shutting down symmetrical engines.
     5.13.4. After landing and clearing the runway, with approval of the pilot, the loadmaster may open
     the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to 12 inches above horizontal, to prepare for cargo offload or
     onload provided all equipment, cargo, and passengers remain secured in the cargo compartment.

5.14. RCR Limitations:
     5.14.1. RCR Values--Type Surface RCR (Dry)/RCR (Wet):
        5.14.1.1. Asphalt/Concrete 23/12
        5.14.1.2. Aluminum Matting 20/10
        5.14.1.3. M8A1/with Anti-Skid (PSP) 20/8
        5.14.1.4. M8A1/without Anti-Skid (PSP) 13/3
        5.14.1.5. Clay 16/5
        5.14.1.6. Coral 16/4
        5.14.1.7. Crushed Rock 16/5
     5.14.2. Limit aircraft operations into and out of slush or water covered runways to a covering of 1
     inch. This number is based on performance charts where an ESC of 10 is equal to 1 inch of slush or
     water. Performance data where more than 1 inch of slush or water is present may not be accurate.
     5.14.3. Figure 5.2. provides obstruction clearance criteria for ground operations. It depicts minimum
     obstacle clearance with the main landing gear on the edge of the operating surface. Aircraft com-
     manders will be advised of any known obstructions that penetrate the shaded area of Figure 5.2.

5.15. Reverse Taxi:
     5.15.1. The pilot will coordinate engine status/utilization with the flight engineer, and taxi directions
     and signals to be used with the loadmaster and marshaller prior to commencing reverse taxi opera-
     tions.
     5.15.2. Open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to approximately 12 inches above the horizontal
     (ADS) position.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                                 45


   5.15.3. The loadmaster will be on the ramp in position to direct reverse taxi, report any hazards, and
   provide the pilot with timely interphone instructions on turns, distance remaining, condition of the
   maneuvering area, and stopping point.
   CAUTION: If more than 2 ground loading ramps, or canary slide ground loading ramps are installed,
   at least one must be removed to allow unobstructed vision from the cargo ramp while backing.
   5.15.4. During night reverse taxi operations, the pilot and loadmaster will ensure that visibility in the
   taxi area is sufficient to conduct safe taxi operations. The loading lights, retracted landing lights, aldis
   lamp, NVG, or any other source that provides adequate lighting of the taxi area may be used.
   5.15.5. Stop no less than 25 feet from an obstruction even if using a wing walker.

5.16. Buddy and Windmill Taxi Starts. Buddy and windmill taxi starts may be performed when
required by the training lesson plan or when approved by the wing, group, or theater commander. Wing
or group commanders may delegate this authority to their squadron or mission commander when the unit
is deployed. This authorization will not be construed to allow repeated buddy or windmill starts at vari-
ous scheduled en route stops. Load all passengers after completion of a buddy or windmill taxi start.

5.17. Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, initiate takeoffs from the beginning of the approved usable por-
tion of the runway. The decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the aircraft commander.
Base TOLD card computations on the runway remaining at the point the takeoff is initiated.

5.18. Reduced Power Operations. Reduced power operations are intended to prolong engine service
life.
   5.18.1. During proficiency air work (flights or operations that are mainly confined to any local traffic
   pattern), when reduced power is used, TIT will not be less than 900 degrees C for takeoff, not to
   exceed 19,600 inch-pounds of torque.
   5.18.2. Reduce power for formation takeoffs (if applicable) to a torque corresponding to no less than
   970 degrees C TIT for takeoff and climb. Power settings higher than 970 degrees C TIT will be as
   briefed by the formation commander.
   5.18.3. Climb power to cruise altitude will be 970 degrees C TIT for -15 engines and 932 degrees C
   TIT for -7 engines, not to exceed 19,600 inch-pounds of torque, unless mission requirements dictate
   otherwise.
   5.18.4. Use maximum power for maximum effort or NVG takeoffs in max effort conditions, not to
   exceed 19,600 inch-pounds of torque. When accomplishing NVG takeoffs using normal procedures
   or doing NVG touch and go's, maximum power is not required.

5.19. Three-Engine Takeoffs. Actual engine-out takeoffs require MAJCOM/DO waiver (HQ AFRC/
DO for AFRC aircraft).

5.20. Aircraft Recovery From Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews should not normally attempt to recover
an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto soft, unprepared surfaces which are not suitable for taxi. Ground
crews using the appropriate equipment will accomplish aircraft recovery. Aircrews may accomplish
recovery at austere locations if, after thorough inspection, the aircraft commander is sure there is no dam-
46                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


age and the surface will support the aircraft. If there is damage or if there is any doubt that the surface will
support the aircraft, aircrews will not attempt recovery.

5.21. Engines Running Onload or Offload (ERO). Do not use ERO procedures when explosive cargo
is involved unless authorized by the JA/ATT/exercise operation order or contingency air tasking orders.
     5.21.1. The ERO procedures in this paragraph may be used for any mix of personnel or cargo. The
     aft cargo door and ramp is preferred when more than 10 passengers are involved. Aircraft command-
     ers will assess prevailing weather, lighting, and parking location to ensure a safe operation.
     5.21.2. General Procedures:
        5.21.2.1. Aircraft commanders will brief crewmembers on the intended ERO operation, empha-
        sizing specific crewmember duties.
        5.21.2.2. The parking brake will be set and one pilot will monitor brakes, interphone, and radio.
        5.21.2.3. Operate engines in ground idle (low speed, if applicable). If conditions warrant, open
        air deflector doors and lower flaps to reduce prop or jet blast aft of the aircraft.
        5.21.2.4. Turn wing leading edge lights on during night ERO. Taxi lights may be used at the dis-
        cretion of the aircraft commander.
        5.21.2.5. Complete passenger and cargo manifests, crew lists, and DD Form 365-4, Weight and
        Balance Clearance Form F, for the subsequent sortie. NOTE: DD Form 365-4 is not required
        for subsequent sortie if aircraft departs empty.
        5.21.2.6. Resume taxi after the door warning light is out and when the LM has verbally acknowl-
        edged that the aircraft is ready for taxiing.
        CAUTION: Due to hazards involved (i.e., prop blast, proximity to engines or props, lack of
        paratroop door steps), only hand transferable items of cargo may be on or offloaded through the
        paratroop doors during EROs.
        5.21.2.7. Do not onload or offload through the crew entrance door and ramp, or paratroop doors
        at the same time.
     5.21.3. Personnel onload and offload through the crew entrance door.
        5.21.3.1. During enplaning and deplaning, station a crewmember (normally the LM) on inter-
        phone (cord held taut) approximately 25 feet and at a 45-degree angle from the aircraft axis.
        5.21.3.2. Brief deplaning personnel to remain forward of the interphone cord.
        5.21.3.3. The aircraft commander will give clearance to open the crew entrance door.
     5.21.4. Personnel or cargo onload and offload through the aft cargo door and ramp.
        5.21.4.1. After clearance from the pilot, open the aft cargo door, and lower the ramp as required.
        5.21.4.2. The loadmaster will direct all onload and offload operations. Passengers will be
        escorted by a crewmember when enplaning or deplaning. Deplane passengers before cargo and
        enplane passengers after cargo unless cargo size or location dictate otherwise.
        5.21.4.3. After the aircraft is slowed to taxi speed, the loadmaster may remove all tiedowns
        except one forward and one aft restraint. Remove remaining restraints only after the aircraft is
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             47


       stopped and vehicle drivers are in place. Brief drivers not to release vehicle parking brakes until
       all restraint is removed and cleared by the loadmaster.
       5.21.4.4. The loadmaster will direct all onload and offload operations using prebriefed signals.
       Other qualified loadmasters may direct the operation if available, but the crew loadmaster retains
       overall responsibility for the operation.
       5.21.4.5. Station the crew loadmaster or another crewmember on interphone and PA in the cargo
       compartment as a safety observer. Safety observers other than the loadmaster will remain forward
       of all cargo.
   5.21.5. ERO for crew changes during local training missions is authorized provided the enplaning
   crew does not approach the aircraft until the deplaning loadmaster on headset is in position outside the
   aircraft. Keep ERO for crew changes to the absolute minimum necessary to accomplish the mission.

Section 5C—Short Field Operations

5.22. General. Only mission qualified aircrews are authorized to operate in accordance with this section.
Use normal takeoff and landing procedures whenever practical. Use short field procedures outlined in
this section and flight manual maximum effort procedures when normal runway criteria cannot be met.

5.23. Landing Zone (LZ) Requirements:
   5.23.1. Minimum LZ criteria are specified in paragraph 5.12. and AFI 13-217.
   5.23.2. LZ markings may vary depending upon the using agency (refer to AFI 13-217). The system
   to be used must be firmly established during mission planning and included in the aircrew briefing.
   Regardless of the system used, aircrew procedures will be in accordance with this section and the
   flight manual.
   5.23.3. Communications and navigational aids vary based on mission requirements and reception
   committee capability.
   5.23.4. Crash fire rescue (CFR) requirements at non-USAF active flying bases are as follows:
       5.23.4.1. Up to 4 takeoffs and landings within 14 consecutive days may be accomplished at an LZ
       or airfield without CFR.
       5.23.4.2. For more frequent operations at an LZ or airfield, base CFR requirements on the maxi-
       mum number of aircraft on the ground (MOG), at one time, requiring onload or offload, servicing,
       or maintenance:

Table 5.1. CFR Requirements.
    MOG              14          58          Over 8
  P2/4/15/19          1           1            2
   P13/20             1           1

NOTE:
Non-USAF CFR vehicles may be used if the agent capacities and pumping capabilities are equivalent.

        5.23.4.3. Waivers to the CFR requirement will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Forward
        request through channels to MAJCOM/DOT. Include the following information:
            5.23.4.3.1. Dates of operation.
            5.23.4.3.2. Type of aircraft and MOG.
            5.23.4.3.3. Type of CFR available.
            5.23.4.3.4. Description of LZ or airfield.
            5.23.4.3.5. Mission impact if waiver is disapproved.

5.24. Landing Zone Assessment. The fluid situation in combat may make changes to the mission plan
necessary. Carefully evaluate aircraft capabilities and the mission environment before the operation.
Consider the following:
     5.24.1. Security of the operating area.
     5.24.2. Terrain and obstacle features along the approach or departure path.
     5.24.3. Runway surface conditions (dust, small holes, damaged PSP, smooth).
     5.24.4. Surface temperature and altitude.
     5.24.5. Usable runway length and width.
     5.24.6. Surface acceleration and deceleration factors (soft, dry, wet, ice, slope).
     5.24.7. Gross weight of aircraft.
     5.24.8. Surface winds (head, tail, cross, gust).
     5.24.9. Number of takeoffs and landings required.

5.25. Arrival. Plan arrival altitudes to minimize the threat. When more than one aircraft is involved,
consider using multiple altitudes and traffic patterns to prevent predictable targeting by the enemy.

5.26. Traffic Pattern. Fly normal traffic patterns when the environment permits. Hostile activity or ter-
rain may require significant modifications to normal traffic patterns. Options are to enter the traffic pat-
tern via an initial, downwind, base, straight-in, or perpendicular to the runway. During hostile activity, the
pilot can control several factors that may reduce the time in a threat envelope. These are altitude, arrival
and departure flight path, proximity to the airfield, and proximity to known threats. The approach must be
unpredictable. Comprehensive mission planning and knowledge of the threat location, density, and capa-
bility will dictate the specific tactics to be employed. Ingenuity is the key in determining what type of
approach to fly. See Section 16E for specific tactical approach techniques.
     5.26.1. Random Steep Approach. This maneuver is based on a modified 360 degree overhead
     approach to a maximum effort or normal landing. Conditions may require random steep approach
     procedures be modified to satisfy local conditions.
        5.26.1.1. Establish initial at approximately 4,500 feet AGL and accomplish the before landing
        checklist.
        5.26.1.2. When approximately one-third of the distance down the runway, extend 100 percent
        flaps and commence descent while beginning a 360 degree turn to final.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              49


      5.26.1.3. Maintain 140 KIAS or approach speed, which ever is higher, until wings level on final.
      Plan the approach to remain within 2 miles of the airfield and to enter no less than a ¼ mile nor
      more than a 1 mile final. The maneuver can be modified to enter on other than an initial; i.e., 270
      or 90 degree overhead. In these cases, change the initial altitude according to the pilot's judgment.
   5.26.2. Random Low Altitude Visual Approach. This maneuver is based on approaching the air-
   field from an unpredictable direction at low en route altitude (e.g., 300' AGL) and en route airspeed
   with the descent/before landing checklist (applicable items) accomplished.
      5.26.2.1. Begin a level slowdown maneuvering to approach speed at a predetermined point.
      While remaining at low altitude, maneuver the aircraft to enter a point on final no less than ¼ mile
      from the runway, accomplish the before landing checklist, and complete the landing IAW the
      flight manual.
      5.26.2.2. The pilot may elect to make a climbing slowdown to normal traffic pattern altitude.
      Maneuver the aircraft to enter no less than a ¼ mile final, accomplish the before landing checklist,
      and complete the landing IAW the flight manual.

5.27. Specific Aircrew Procedures:
   5.27.1. Shortfield Landing Procedures. The following procedures are in addition to the normal
   landing procedures in the flight manual.
      5.27.1.1. Close the engine bleed air valves as required.
      5.27.1.2. During the final stage of landing roll, reduce reverse thrust, if conditions permit, to pre-
      vent debris from causing a restriction to visibility or engine damage.
      5.27.1.3. Do not land under the following conditions:
          5.27.1.3.1. Lack of or improper identification received from the LZ.
          5.27.1.3.2. An abort signal given by the reception committee leader; for example, extinguish-
          ing the LZ markings.
   5.27.2. Ground Operations:
      5.27.2.1. Low speed ground idle should be used when blowing dust and sand are present.
      5.27.2.2. Engine shutdown will depend upon the type of mission and loading or offloading
      requirements. Position the aircraft and "cuff" one propeller before engine shutdown at fields
      where availability of ground power is not known to permit a buddy start if the GTC or APU fails.
      5.27.2.3. To prevent damage to pneumatic system components when operating in conditions of
      blowing dust, sand, grass, etc., the following procedures will apply:
          5.27.2.3.1. Delay GTC or APU start until aircraft is parked.
          5.27.2.3.2. After engine start, close all bleed valves unless absolutely needed.
          5.27.2.3.3. Brief the RCL, LZCO, or CCT and subsequent aircrews on any unexpected haz-
          ards (dust, winds, hostile activity) encountered during takeoff or landing.

Section 5D—Combat Loading
50                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


5.28. General. Combat loading is comprised of three types of operations: combat offload, passenger
combat loading, and rapid infiltration.

5.29. Combat Offload Procedures. Combat offload provides a means of offloading single, multiple,
and married pallets, airdrop platforms, and CDS containers (loaded in the CVR) without the use of mate-
rial handling equipment. The wing, group, or theater commander may authorize combat offload when
hostile conditions or similar situations warrant the use of these procedures. HC/MC-130 aircraft are nor-
mally not configured to perform combat offloads. See Chapter 19 for specific procedures and checklists.

5.30. Passenger Combat Loading:
     5.30.1. During contingency operations, maximum troops, passengers, or patients can be combat
     loaded on the aircraft without the use of installed seats, seat belts, or litter stanchions. All personnel
     in the cargo compartment will be seated and secured except those individual crewmembers having
     valid duties to perform.
     5.30.2. General Procedures:
        5.30.2.1. If available, mattress or cushioning material may be used for seating.
        5.30.2.2. Seat troops, passengers, and ambulatory patients facing forward. Seat personnel in rows
        not to exceed five across.
        5.30.2.3. Attach a tiedown strap for each row of personnel to provide forward restraint and body
        stability.
        5.30.2.4. Secure all baggage on the ramp. Excess baggage and cargo may be secured on the cargo
        floor or a pallet and will decrease the number of troops, passengers, and patients proportionately.
        5.30.2.5. When airlifting litter patients, position the litters longitudinally (patient's head aft) and
        secure each of the litters with a tiedown strap. For one litter, hook the tiedown strap into a floor
        ring, run laterally, wrapping the strap around each litter handle once, hook the ratchet end to the
        nearest tiedown ring, and tighten. For two litters side by side, use two tiedown straps for each end
        hooked into "D" row rings, run the straps laterally, one left and one right, over each outboard litter
        handle to the nearest tiedown ring, and tighten. For three litters side by side, wrap the straps
        around adjacent handles.

5.31. Rapid Infiltration/Exfiltration Ground Procedures:
     5.31.1. General. Use these procedures when conducting authorized Infil or Exfil operations. All
     personnel in the cargo compartment will be seated and secured except those crewmembers having
     valid duties to perform. Troops will provide their own restraining devices. If they do not have per-
     sonal restraining devices, secure personnel using passenger combat loading procedures in paragraph
     5.30. Also reference paragraph 16.6. and the flight manual for additional guidance/checklists when
     performing these operations.
     5.31.2. Preparation:
        5.31.2.1. All restraint devices except one forward and one aft (opposite corners) may be removed
        during taxi to the offload point. Self-propelled vehicles must have drivers in place with brakes set
        prior to removing restraints. EXCEPTION: All restraints will remain on helicopters except for
        the tail boom until the aircraft has come to a complete stop.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              51


       5.31.2.2. Vehicles will not be started in flight.
       5.31.2.3. The loadmaster may disconnect/disengage ADS arms at the 10-minute warning prior to
       landing. Reconnect/reengage after takeoff as soon as mission requirements allow.
       5.31.2.4. Vehicle fuel tanks will not exceed ¾ full when positioned on the cargo floor. Fuel tanks
       for vehicles transported on the ramp will not exceed ½ full.
       5.31.2.5. Ordnance:
           5.31.2.5.1. 2.75" rockets and other missile type arms may be taken out of shipping containers
           and shipping tubes. Safety rings must remain attached. They may be secured in the vehicle
           for storage or maintained by user force personnel.
           5.31.2.5.2. Machine or gatling gun ammo may be kept readily available, but will not be
           breeched (chambered) until exiting the aircraft.
           5.31.2.5.3. Troops may maintain their own small arms ammo, but weapons will not be
           breeched (chambered) until exiting the aircraft.
   5.31.3. The loadmaster will notify personnel at 60, 30, 20, 10, 6, 1 minute, and immediately prior to
   landing. Give a "Prepare to land" advisory when minimums have been called.
   5.31.4. Loadmasters will wear NVGs during blacked out operations. Loadmasters will wear NVGs
   on aircraft with NVG compatible lighting, however, they may be raised when NVG lighting is on.
   5.31.5. Procedures After Touchdown:
       5.31.5.1. Open the cargo ramp and door to horizontal when the pilot states, "Clear to Open," or as
       prebriefed. Lower the ramp to the ground once the aircraft has stopped and the pilot states "Clear
       to Offload."
       CAUTION: Maintain positive control of canary slides/ground loading ramps.
       5.31.5.2. Position canary slides/ground loading ramps.

NOTE:
If there is going to be a time delay before onloading occurs, raise the ramp enough to allow the aircraft to
be taxied in the event of an emergency.
       5.31.5.3. Complete offload or onload:
           5.31.5.3.1. Raise canary slides/ground loading ramps.
           5.31.5.3.2. Raise the ramp to horizontal.
           5.31.5.3.3. Notify the pilot "Clear to Taxi."
       5.31.5.4. Secure canary slides/ground loading ramps.
       5.31.5.5. Close the ramp and door.
       5.31.5.6. Turn on the red or NVG-compatible lights.
       5.31.5.7. Prior to takeoff, ensure vehicles/equipment are secure, exits are secure, and warning
       lights are out.
       5.31.5.8. Connect/engage ADS arms after takeoff as soon as mission requirements allow.

                             GENERAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

Section 6A—Premission

6.1. Aircrew Uniforms. Wear the aircrew uniform on all missions, unless other attire is authorized.
(When the USAF Foreign Clearance Guide requires civilian attire, wear conservatively styled civilian
clothing.) All aircrew members will have flight gloves readily available during all flights and will wear
them for takeoffs, landings, and when operating in a combat environment. Arctic clothing is required
when engaged in Arctic or Antarctic operations.

6.2. Personal and Professional Equipment. Crewmembers will carry or wear personal and professional
equipment as follows:
   6.2.1. Flight Kits. Carry a headset, helmet and oxygen mask, and operable flashlight on all flights.
   When quick-don oxygen masks are installed, they will be preflighted (to include communications
   hook up) if they are used as the primary oxygen source. If the helmet and oxygen mask is the primary
   oxygen source throughout the flight, the quick-don mask is not required to be preflighted or hooked
   up.

NOTE:
Crewmembers will present their personal helmet and oxygen mask to the life support facility for cleaning,
maintenance, and communications testing every 30 days.
   6.2.2. Identification Tags. Identification tags should be worn around the neck or carried in a flight
   suit pocket.
   6.2.3. Passports. Carry passports on missions when required by the Foreign Clearance Guide.
   6.2.4. Shot Records. Carry shot records on all missions outside the CONUS, Alaska, or Hawaii.
   Aircrew members will ensure they meet immunization requirements for the mission.
   6.2.5. Jewelry. Do not wear finger rings, earrings, or other loose fitting jewelry while in, on, or
   around aircraft.
   6.2.6. Glasses. Wear prescribed glasses or contact lenses as required by AFI 11-202V3.
   6.2.7. Restricted Area Badges. Carry the restricted area badge on all missions (except actual com-
   bat missions). Display the badge only in designated restricted areas.
   6.2.8. Protective Headgear:
       6.2.8.1. All mobile crewmembers in the cargo compartment will wear flight helmets during the
       following flight conditions:
           6.2.8.1.1. Anytime a static line is attached to an anchor cable, except SATB drops.
           6.2.8.1.2. Anytime extraction airdrop is conducted.
       6.2.8.2. All personnel aft of FS 617 will wear flight helmets during the following open door con-
       figured operations:
54                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


           6.2.8.2.1. Pyrotechnic deliveries.
           6.2.8.2.2. MA-1 kit deliveries.
           6.2.8.2.3. Helicopter Air Refueling (HAR) Operations.
           WARNING: Personnel will not position themselves directly under the center anchor cable
           supports (A-frames, FS 737) during personnel or equipment airdrop requiring the use of the
           anchor cable.
           WARNING: Personnel in the cargo compartment during airdrops will not be seated under the
           anchor cables or static line retriever cables that are rigged for use during that operation. When
           cargo compartment configuration or mission requirements dictate, personnel with protective
           headgear may be seated under airdrop rigged anchor cables and static line retriever cables.
       6.2.8.3. When conditions require personnel in the cargo compartment to wear protective head-
       gear, the flight helmet will be worn with the chin strap fastened from the first airdrop or extraction
       warning signal until the cargo compartment has been secured after the completion of the airdrop or
       extraction.

NOTE:
Helmet visors should be lowered or eye protection worn by all personnel aft of FS 617 on all airdrops,
HAR, and pyrotechnic missions requiring doors to be open.
       6.2.8.4. After acknowledgment of the 20-minute warning and donning of the helmet, loadmasters
       may clear off headset with the aircraft commander's approval to facilitate movement around large
       platforms or CDS loads. After completing required 20-minute checklist items, the primary load-
       master will remain on interphone throughout the remainder of the drop.

6.3. Tool and Airdrop Kits. A tool kit will be on board for all flights. Individual units will establish
requirements for tools to be included in these kits and the crewmember responsible for the kit (ARC air-
craft tool kits will satisfy this requirement). One loadmaster airdrop kit will be on board for aerial deliv-
ery missions.

6.4. Publications. Primary crewmembers will carry the publications specified in Table 6.1. on all mis-
sions. This requirement may be satisfied if fully posted publications are kept on board the aircraft. For
multiple crew positions, crew members may coordinate to see that all required publications are carried.

6.5. Airfield Review. See AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 2, as supplemented. If a restriction applies to C-130
aircraft, ACC crews must comply. Waiver authority for these restrictions is the MAJCOM/DO. Forward
requests for waiver through OGV channels.
EXCEPTION: Crews using NVG procedures may operate at night at airfields that are otherwise
restricted to daylight only operations.

Section 6B—Predeparture

6.6. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). Review volume I, part A, of the FCIF before all missions.
   6.6.1. If material has been added to the FCIF since the last review, enter the latest FCIF item number,
   date, and initials on the AF Form 4121, FCIF Currency Record.
   6.6.2. Crewmembers delinquent in FCIF review and joining a mission en route will receive an FCIF
   update from their primary aircrew member counterpart on that mission. Instructor pilots flying with
   general officers are responsible for briefing appropriate FCIF items.
   6.6.3. Crewmembers not assigned or attached to that unit will certify FCIF review by entering the last
   FCIF number and their initials beside their name on the file copy of the flight authorization or their
   ACM orders.

6.7. Unit Mission Kits. Units will maintain one mission kit per aircraft. Prior to off-station departures,
the aircraft commander or a designated representative will ensure a current mission kit is on board the air-
craft. The kit will contain, but is not limited to, the items listed in Table 6.2. Formal school units will
establish the content of the mission kit for their assigned aircraft. Items required by a unit or wing direc-

Section 6C—Briefings

6.8. Requirements:
   6.8.1. Briefings should be clear, concise, and designed to provide mission essential information. Sup-
   plement and shorten briefings with visual aids, flimsies, checklists, etc., when practical. Avoid need-
   less repetition of published procedures. Schedule briefings after considering the particular mission,
   crew rest, and other pertinent factors. Aircrew members must be provided all applicable information
   available to ensure complete and professional aircrew planning. Refer to specific employment vol-
   umes for briefing content.
   6.8.2. Crewmembers will not fly unless they attend the crew briefings for their mission. EXCEP-
   TION: When premission requirements dictate, aircraft commanders may excuse certain crewmem-
   bers from the briefing. The aircraft commander will ensure that those personnel receive a face-to-face
   briefing prior to engine start.

Section 6D— Flight Planning

6.9. Adherence To Rules. Comply with AFI 11-202V3, Foreign Clearance Guide, Flight Information
Publication (FLIP), host nation procedures, and this volume.

6.10. Call Signs. Rescue aircraft will use the standard rescue call signs "King XX" for all missions
except:
   6.10.1. Search and Rescue (SAR). On all SAR operations, use the call sign "Air Force Rescue" plus
   the last five digits of the aircraft tail number.

     6.10.2. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). For actual AE missions, use the call sign "Air Evac," plus
     the last five digits of the aircraft tail number or designator required by FLIP.
     6.10.3. Operational Missions. Aircraft will use the call sign(s) assigned by the OPORD, FRAG,
     SPINS, or diplomatic clearance. If no call sign is assigned to the mission, use the standard rescue call
     sign "King XX."
     6.10.4. Diplomatic (DIP) Clearance. Certain countries grant DIP clearance by mission number.
     Pass the mission number and call sign to the controlling agency upon entering such country's airspace
     and then use the call sign directed by that agency.

6.11. Instrument Flight Rules. See AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 8, as supplemented.

6.12. Flight Plans:
     6.12.1. Regardless of whether a flight plan is prepared by the aircrew or is furnished by another
     agency, the aircraft commander and navigator will verify routes and flight altitudes to ensure proper
     terrain clearance. The aircrew navigator who prepares or accepts the flight plan will remain on duty
     at the navigator's station during departure and will brief the relieving navigator thoroughly on all en
     route and destination hazards.
     6.12.2. Unscheduled changes in crew, passenger, and aeromedical patient lists are authorized pro-
     vided corrections to the crew list or passenger manifest are filed with the local command and control
     center, base operations, FAA office, or airport manager's office, at the airfield being transited.

6.13. International Procedures:
     6.13.1. Review the USAF Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) and brief crewmembers on applicable
     items before flying outside the CONUS. Comply with FLIP Area Planning and applicable host nation
     rules.
     6.13.2. Complete customs, immigration, agriculture, immunization, and quarantine as specified in the
     USAF FCG. The unit dispatching the mission is responsible for border clearance and other special
     clearances, when required (see paragraph 6.69.).

6.14. Departure Planning. See AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217, this chapter, and the appropriate MAJ-
COM supplement.
     6.14.1. For all IFR flights, the approach facility upon which minimums are based must be operational
     at the departure base and departure alternate, and approach equipment in the aircraft must be opera-
     tional. Use runway visual range (RVR), when available, to determine the minimum visibility required
     for takeoff.
     6.14.2. The minimum en route altitude will be the highest minimum en route altitude along a route
     segment except when under positive radar control.

6.15. Alternate Planning:
     6.15.1. See AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 8.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            59


   6.15.2. The aircraft commander retains final authority in the choice of alternate; however, selection
   by support agencies should be used if the criteria in 6.15.1. are met and the aircraft has already been
   serviced.

6.16. Takeoff Minimums. If the departure weather is below published landing minimums, plan for a
departure alternate IAW AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 8, as supplemented.

6.17. Destination and Air Refueling Abort Alternates. Alternate requirements will be IAW AFI
11-202V3, Chapter 8.

6.18. Adverse Weather Planning. All missions should be planned to avoid areas of severe weather,
including icing or severe turbulence. Avoid thunderstorms and cumulonimbus clouds (CBs) using the fol-
lowing criteria:
   6.18.1. Climb Out, En route, and Descent:
       6.18.1.1. FL 230 and Above: 20 NM.
       6.18.1.2. Below FL 230: 10 NM.
       6.18.1.3. Low level operations: 5 NM.
       6.18.1.4. Clear the top of a known or suspected severe thunderstorm by at least 1,000 feet altitude
       for each 10 knots of wind speed at the cloud top. Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a rapidly
       moving thunderstorm.
       6.18.1.5. Avoid the rain shaft and cloud base of thunderstorms and CBs using the criteria of
       6.18.1.2. and 6.18.1.3. Do not fly under the anvil of a cumulonimbus cloud.
       6.18.1.6. Avoid thunderstorms visually, by airborne radar, or by specific request of a
       ground-based radar with a weather painting capability. When relying exclusively on
       ground-based radar for weather avoidance and the ground controller is unable to provide avoid-
       ance instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
          6.18.1.6.1. Changing routing.
          6.18.1.6.2. Diverting to alternate.
          6.18.1.6.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance if unable to maintain
          VMC in an area of significant weather and the ground radar facility cannot provide weather
          avoidance service.
       6.18.1.7. The use of ground-based radar as the primary means of thunderstorm avoidance should
       be used only to depart an area of significant weather. It should never be considered a normal
       avoidance procedure.
   6.18.2. Takeoff and Landing. The size and intensity of thunderstorms or CBs are so variable that
   the aircraft commander must determine avoidance criteria to be used during takeoff and landing.
   Takeoff and landing may be made without regard to the criteria in 6.18.1. provided:
       6.18.2.1. The thunderstorm or CBs and associated gust front, if present, can be avoided.
       6.18.2.2. The distance from the thunderstorm or CBs is increased as soon as possible after takeoff
       to meet the criteria in 6.18.1.
60                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


        6.18.2.3. A missed approach course from the missed approach point is available which will pro-
        vide separation similar to that for departures.
        6.18.2.4. The aircraft is not flown below thunderstorms, CBs, or through the rain shaft associated
        with these clouds.
     6.18.3. Lightning Avoidance. Lightning occurs at all levels in a thunderstorm. The majority of
     lightning discharges never strike the ground but occur between clouds or within the same cloud at
     nearly all temperatures and altitudes. Lightning also occurs in the clear air around the top and sides of
     storms.

6.19. Fuel Planning. Use the appropriate fuel planning publication or TO specified in Chapter 11 of this
volume for fuel planning. While flying at long-range cruise (LRC) at the cruise ceiling is the most con-
servative method and therefore encouraged, aircraft commanders may elect to fly at other speeds and alti-
tudes deemed appropriate for the mission.
     6.19.1. Add Extra Fuel:
        6.19.1.1. When fuel is unavailable at en route stops; when compressed ground times during sin-
        gle-day, multi-sortie missions preclude refueling at each en route stop; or when en route refueling
        would delay or be detrimental to mission accomplishment.
        6.19.1.2. When passengers or patients are on board, to recover at a suitable airfield from ETP at
        10,000 feet MSL in the event of unpressurized flight.
     6.19.2. Required Fuel At Destination. Minimum fuel overhead destination or alternate is 7,000
     pounds. Land with a minimum of 6,000 pounds fuel remaining.
     6.19.3. Fuel Conservation. Make every reasonable effort to conserve fuel. Some recommended
     methods are:
        6.19.3.1. Cruise at optimum altitude. Step climb if practical.
        6.19.3.2. Fly missions at the most fuel conservative cruise speed option. On missions which are
        time rather than distance oriented, consider flying the lowest practical cruise option. Aircraft
        commanders are encouraged to fly long-range cruise airspeeds on other missions if practical.
        6.19.3.3. Use low speed ground idle or two engine symmetrical power when practical for ground
        operation.
        6.19.3.4. Cruise at the altitude that gives the best ground distance traveled for each pound of fuel
        consumed. As a rule of thumb, climb if ground speed is reduced less than 5 knots for each 1,000
        feet of altitude increase. Descend if ground speed will increase more than 5 knots for each 1,000
        feet of altitude decrease. Do not fly above cruise ceiling.

6.20. Authenticators and Classified Documents. Obtain and safeguard current authenticators and
other classified materials required for the area being transited. Carry authenticators when flying into an
ADIZ, participating in exercises, on overseas missions, deployments, and when specified in operation
plans. The COMSEC material required depends on the theater of operation and user. The base COMSEC
custodian has access to the AFKAG 44/AFKAG 14 and can assist in obtaining the material required for
the mission. Base operations at AMC bases maintains the COMSEC material used on most missions.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              61


6.21. Mission Folder. Each unit, except formal school units, will develop a mission folder for each mis-
sion to ensure all predeparture information is available to aircrews.

6.22. Navigation Kits:
   6.22.1. The aircraft commander will be issued a route navigation kit at the home station which will
   remain with the aircraft until its return. Kits should contain sufficient quantities of material to cover
   the complete round trip from the issuing station and return, plus appropriate materials to cover the the-
   ater of operation.
   6.22.2. Segregate route navigation kits into two separate parts:
       6.22.2.1. Part I. Sufficient material to cover the planned route trip and theater of operation.
       6.22.2.2. Part II. For intertheater missions only. Maps, charts, and flight information publica-
       tions for global operation, excluding items in Part I.
   6.22.3. The theater commander may augment kits as necessary to meet special operational require-
   ments.
   6.22.4. Minimum contents of route navigation kits will be in accordance with Table 6.3. Command-
   ers may modify the items as necessary for local training missions.

Section 6E—Preflight

6.23. Dash One Preflight:
     6.23.1. The aircrew Dash One preflight inspection, once completed, is valid for 72 hours, provided
     the aircraft is either sealed or continuously monitored by squadron personnel. For alert aircraft, fol-
     low paragraph 3.9.
     6.23.2. When an aircrew assumes a preflighted spare or quick-turn, a thorough visual inspection will
     be performed, paying particular attention to areas affected by maintenance or servicing.

6.24. AFTO Form 781, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Data Record. Review the AFTO Form 781 before
applying power to the aircraft or operating aircraft systems. The exceptional release (ER) must be signed
before flight. A maintenance officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs
the ER. If one of these individuals is not available, the aircraft commander may sign the ER. Ensure the
USAF Fuel Identaplate is on board the aircraft.

6.25. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight, with a condition which might
be hazardous for continued use, if the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to another station. Waiver author-
ity is MAJCOM/DO.
     6.25.1. The release must first be authorized by the chief of maintenance, the senior maintenance
     officer, or the chief of the AFMC repair team.
     6.25.2. After the maintenance release is obtained, contact ACC/AFRC for flight authorization.
     6.25.3. The maintenance release, ACC/AFRC approval, and the aircraft commander's concurrence
     are all required before the aircraft can be flown to the specified destination.

6.26. Aircraft Refueling. Use primary fuel management IAW the aircraft flight manual whenever prac-
tical. Aircrew members qualified in refueling may perform refueling duties at austere locations or at sta-
tions without maintenance support. Crew chiefs should be scheduled on those missions where a need is
anticipated. Two qualified personnel are required. Aircrews should not refuel except in cases when main-
tenance support is not readily available and the mission would be delayed.
     6.26.1. Hot Refueling Operations. Reference Chapter 19.
     6.26.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. Simultaneous aircraft refueling or defueling and cargo
     loading or maintenance operations is authorized IAW TO 00-25-172. Refueling or defueling with
     passengers or patients on board is authorized only for aeromedical evacuation missions IAW TO
     00-25-172.
     6.26.3. Crash, Fire, and Rescue Protection:
        6.26.3.1. The aircraft engine fire extinguisher system fulfills the minimum requirements for fire
        protection during engine start. If available, position a portable fire extinguisher for added fire pro-
        tection.
        6.26.3.2. A fire guard is required for all engine starts. In the absence of additional ground per-
        sonnel, the ground controller may act as fire guard.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                               63


   6.26.4. Aircrew/Maintenance Engine Run-ups. A mixed aircrew/maintenance engine run will not
   be accomplished unless approved by the SQ/CC.
   6.26.5. Towing. Aircrew members normally will not participate in towing operations. The aircraft
   commander will coordinate with the senior maintenance officer or superintendent to ensure the towing
   supervisor and crew are qualified. At non-USAF installations, the aircraft commander must have
   approval from the airfield operations officer or manager prior to towing. The aircraft commander will
   ensure that the tow team supervisor briefs all personnel on their duties and the associated hazards.
   Proper checklists will be used. If any doubt exists as to the qualification of tow team personnel or the
   safety of the operation, make no attempt to tow the aircraft until qualified Air Force personnel can be
   located. Under no circumstances will any crewmember act as the towing supervisor.
       6.26.5.1. Aircraft Pushback Operations. In situations where aircraft backing cannot be per-
       formed and time constraints and/or adverse weather prevent ground personnel from prepositioning
       the aircraft, aircrew members may be required to participate in aircraft pushback operations.
       Comply with the requirements in paragraph 6.26.5. above. Following pushback, chocks will be
       installed prior to disconnecting the tow bar and the flight engineer will deplane to inspect the nose-
       wheel scissor connection. Commence with BEFORE STARTING ENGINES checklist.

NOTE:
If a Dash-1 preflight was performed and no bleed down was performed, it should be accomplished at this
time.

6.27. Life Support Requirements:
   6.27.1. Oxygen. Oxygen on board for takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned flight
   from the equal time point (ETP) should oxygen be required (minimum 5 liters or 300 psi). On mis-
   sions with passengers, carry passenger oxygen kits (POK) if flight above FL 250 is anticipated.
   Ensure access to POKs is not blocked during flight. Distribute POKs and demonstrate their use prior
   to exceeding FL 250. The POK provides no protection when ambient air contains smoke or fumes.
   6.27.2. Rafts. Ensure sufficient wing well life rafts are on board to accommodate all passengers and
   aircrew members on overwater flights.
   6.27.3. Life Preservers (LPUs):
       6.27.3.1. Ensure a sufficient quantity of life preservers are on board for all passengers and crew-
       members for overwater flights. While overwater, LPUs will be sized and available at the crew-
       member's station, and worn whenever below 2,000 feet overwater (except for takeoff and
       landing). Crewmembers wearing a parachute or harness during air refueling overwater will also
       wear an LPU. For overwater missions carrying children and infants, ensure appropriate number
       and type of LPUs are on board.
   6.27.4. Anti-exposure Suits. Anti-exposure suits will be available during overwater flights when
   route of flight is beyond power off gliding distance from land and the water temperature is 60 degrees
   Fahrenheit or below. If the water temperature ranges between 51 degrees F and 60 degrees F, the unit
   or mission commander may waive or extend the anti-exposure suit requirement after carefully consid-
   ering the following factors:
       6.27.4.1. Climate zone and existing weather throughout range of flights.
64                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


        6.27.4.2. Operational requirements.
        6.27.4.3. Number and type of aircraft in formation.
        6.27.4.4. Time of flight over water.
        6.27.4.5. Risk, based on aircraft load and mission configuration.
        6.27.4.6. Degree of surveillance over mission.
        6.27.4.7. Location, availability, and capability of search and rescue (SAR) forces (Consider antic-
        ipated time in the water prior to pick-up).
        6.27.4.8. Winds and wave height and their impact on SAR.
        6.27.4.9. Altitude and distance from land.

NOTE:
Anti-exposure suits are not required when only the approach or departure is flown over water.
     6.27.5. Parachutes. All ACC C-130 series aircraft will be configured with one parachute for each
     aircrew member.
        6.27.5.1. Wear parachutes during combat and hazardous acceptance flights.
        6.27.5.2. Personnel performing duties near an open door in-flight will wear a parachute or
        restraining harness; wear a harness during all operations below 1,000 feet AGL.
     6.27.6. Survival Kits/Vests. All ACC C-130 series aircraft will be configured with one survival kit
     (ML-4) for each aircrew member. Survival vests may be used in lieu of survival kits if the mission
     will not take them beyond gliding distance of land. Wear individual survival vests on all combat and
     contingency missions.

6.28. Life Support Equipment Documentation. Life Support will perform termination of flight inspec-
tions immediately or on the next scheduled duty day. Local training missions only require a preflight
inspection prior to the first flight of the day.
     6.28.1. The aircraft commander or designated representative will ensure appropriate serviceable pro-
     tective clothing, life support, survival, and dash 21 equipment for the entire mission are on board the
     aircraft prior to departing home station. Prior to departing home station and following en route crew
     changes, review the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, to ensure all required
     equipment is on board and required inspections have been completed.
     6.28.2. Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will make an entry in the AFTO Form 781.

6.29. IFF/SIF Operations:
     6.29.1. Perform a ground check of the IFF/SIF before takeoff, using either the self test or ground
     radar interrogation. EXCEPTION: Aircraft not at home station are not required to check Mode 4 if
     appropriate equipment is not available.
        6.29.1.1. If self test is unacceptable and radar facilities do not permit a ground check, takeoff is
        authorized if the IFF/SIF was operational on the previous mission. Accomplish an airborne check
        immediately after takeoff.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                               65


       6.29.1.2. Aircraft will not depart with an IFF/SIF known to be inoperative. EXCEPTIONS:
       Formation must have at least one operational IFF/SIF per element. Single aircraft must have the
       approval of ATC and the aircraft commander.
   6.29.2. Use the IFF/SIF IAW Table 6.4.

NOTE:
IFF/SIF mode 1, 2, and 3/A coded, once set and transmitted are unclassified and may be left in the tran-
sponder.
   6.29.3. An operational mode 4 is required for all fixed wing aircraft. An operational check of the
   mode 4 will be made prior to takeoff (test equipment permitting). If mode 4 checks bad or fails
   in-flight, the IFF/SIF unit will be repaired prior to flight and/or aircraft landed for repairs except per
   the following:
       6.29.3.1. Missions that are generated in the CONUS and do not plan to exit the CONUS ADIZ.
       6.29.3.2. Non-training peacetime missions where cancellation or RTB for mode 4 failure would
       seriously degrade effectiveness (i.e., presidential support, disaster relief, SAR, aeromedical evac-
       uation, etc.).

6.30. Cargo Documentation:
   6.30.1. Proper cargo documentation will accompany each load. The cargo manifest and DD Form
   1384, Transportation Control and Movement Document (TCMD) (interpreted punchcard deck or
   manual form), and special handling documents as applicable, will be delivered to the aircraft before
   departure. The manifest will be one of the following:
       6.30.1.1. Computer printed product.
       6.30.1.2. 80/80 (Offline Manifest) listing.
       6.30.1.3. DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest.

        6.30.1.4. DD Form 2131, C-130 Passenger/Cargo Manifest. This form is designed for use dur-
        ing all operations.
     6.30.2. DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record, will accompany the manifest if required.
     6.30.3. Shipper's Declarations for Dangerous Goods prepared by the shipper IAW AFJMAN 24-204
     will accompany the manifest as applicable.

6.31. Dropped Object Prevention. During aircraft exterior visual inspections, pay particular attention to
surfaces, panels, and components which could potentially be dropped objects. If a dropped object is dis-
covered and the mission is continued, the flight crew will:
     6.31.1. Ensure the write-up is entered in the AFTO Form 781A.
     6.31.2. Notify the ACC or respsective command center as soon as practical. Include route of flight,
     altitude, and weather (i.e., turbulence, etc.).

6.32. Narcotics. Crewmembers will ensure narcotics and other unauthorized items are not smuggled on
board the aircraft. Maintain narcotics in the pararescue medical kits IAW appropriate directives.

6.33. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects:
     6.33.1. Hold the number of persons on the flight deck to the minimum commensurate with mission
     requirements. At no time will this exceed nine (seven for C-130E).
     6.33.2. Keep the flight deck area uncluttered and orderly for all flight and ground operations. Specif-
     ically:
        6.33.2.1. Do not place any item (checklist, chart, etc.) on the center pedestal in a position that
        covers or hides from view any switch, light, or gauge. Do not place any item behind condition
        levers or on the throttle quadrant.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              67


       6.33.2.2. Do not store on the flight deck any items not required for use or immediate reference
       in-flight.

6.34. Passenger Policy. DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, establishes criteria for passen-
ger movement on DoD aircraft. It defines five categories of passenger travel: space-available, aeromed-
ical evacuation, orientation, public affairs, and space-required. AFI 11-401, Flight Management,
provides further guidance on orientation and public affairs travel. Refer to these publications directly for
details not addressed in this volume. In all cases, passengers will be manifested on a DD Form 2131, Pas-
senger/Cargo Manifest, or on an automated passenger manifest.

NOTE:
See paragraph 3.3. for ACM policy.
   6.34.1. Space Available. Allows authorized passengers to occupy surplus seats on DoD aircraft after
   all space-required passengers have been accommodated. Required documentation is listed in DoD
   4515.13-R. Passengers process through the passenger terminal. Wing, group, or theater commanders
   may approve space-available travel on Rescue HC/MC-130 and C-130 BAI aircraft after careful con-
   sideration of mission requirements and sensitivities.
       6.34.1.1. Passenger Policy Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified. Air refueling (AR
       and HAR) and low-level operations may be approved on a case-by-case basis by wing, group, or
       theater commanders. All other mission events and simulated EPs are prohibited.
   6.34.2. Aeromedical Evacuation. Defined as the movement of patients by air. Specific guidance on
   eligibility and documentation is contained in DoD 4515.13-R. USCINCTRANSCOM is the single
   manager for policy and procedure.
       6.34.2.1. Restrictions. If tasked to conduct aeromedical evacuation, both pilots must be fully
       qualified. Air refueling (AR and HAR) may be performed if required for mission accomplishment
       after coordination with tasking authority. All other mission events and simulated EPs are prohib-
       ited.
   6.34.3. Orientation. AFI 11-401, Flight Management, contains specific details on the Air Force Ori-
   entation Flight Program. There are four categories of orientation flight: incentive flights, distin-
   guished visitor flights, familiarization flights, and spouse orientation flights. Authorized participants
   and approval authority are contained in AFI 11-401, Table 1.1. Document authorization by letter and
   manifest on DD Form 2131 or on an automated passenger manifest. Requests for approval will
   include the mission profile and mission events to be accomplished. Forward requests through stan/
   eval channels. Report annual orientation activity IAW AFI 11-401 and ACC Sup.
       6.34.3.1. Restrictions:
           6.34.3.1.1. For spouse orientation, comply with restrictions in AFI 11-401 and ACC Sup.
           Additionally, air refueling (HAR and AR), and threat maneuvers are prohibited.
           6.34.3.1.2. For other orientation categories, both pilots must be fully qualified. Air refueling
           (AR and HAR) may be approved on a case by case basis by wing, group, or theater command-
           ers. Simulated EPs are prohibited. All other mission events may be conducted as approved by
           approval authority. Passengers will be seated with belts fastened during threat maneuvers.

     6.34.4. Public Affairs Travel. Defined as travel in the interest of adding to the public understanding
     of DoD activities. AFI 11-401, Flight Management, contains specific details on the Air Force Public
     Affairs Flight Program. Authorized participants and approval authority are contained in AFI 11-401,
     Table 1.1. Document authorization by letter and manifest on DD Form 2131 or on an automated pas-
     senger manifest. Requests for approval will include the mission profile and mission events to be
     accomplished. Forward requests through public affairs channels.
        6.34.4.1. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified. Air refueling (AR and HAR) may be
        approved on a case by case basis by wing, group, or theater commanders. Simulated EPs are pro-
        hibited. All other mission events may be conducted as approved by approval authority. Passen-
        gers will be seated with belts fastened during threat maneuvers.
     6.34.5. Space Required. DoD 4515.13-R lists several categories of passengers, not previously men-
     tioned, who are authorized official travel on DoD aircraft. Apply space-available processing,
     approval, and restrictions from paragraph 6.34.1. and 6.34.1.1. above to all space required categories
     with the following exceptions:
        6.34.5.1. MEGP (Supported Forces). A sub-category of space-required passenger defined by
        this volume as US and foreign military personnel who are an integral part of the mission being
        performed. Approval is assumed by the mission tasking. In all cases, passengers will be mani-
        fested on a DD Form 2131 or on an automated passenger manifest.
            6.34.5.1.1. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified unless excepted by AFI 11-401,
            paragraph 1.12 (Requirements for Pilots in Dual-Controlled Aircraft). Simulated EPs are pro-
            hibited. There are no restrictions on mission events. Passengers will be seated with belts fas-
            tened during threat maneuvers. Aircraft commanders will ensure that supported forces are
            briefed on the mission profile and mission events before flight.
        6.34.5.2. MEGP (Supporting Forces). A sub-category of space-required passenger defined by
        this volume as US and foreign military, DoD civilians, and US civilian employees under contract
        to the DoD, who directly support the mission or a deployment of an ACC unit. This may include,
        but is not limited to; maintenance, communications, intelligence, logistics, fuels, and flight test
        personnel, unit-supporting chaplains, civilian contractors required for in-flight checks or deploy-
        ment support, FAA representatives, STS, fire support officers, and other military personnel who
        are on board to communicate/coordinate with ground forces. Off-station travel is documented by
        travel orders. Local flights will be documented by letter of authorization from the wing, group, or
        theater commander. Squadron commanders/mission commanders may approve squadron
        assigned personnel or maintenance personnel required for mission accomplishment. 18 FLTS/CC
        is the approval authority for supporting forces in conjunction with test missions. When frequent
        local flights are necessary, commanders may issue annual authorizations by name or AFSC as
        appropriate. When using this option, aircraft commanders will ensure that all restrictions in the
        following paragraph are complied with for each individual mission. Manifest all supporting
        forces on DD Form 96.
            6.34.5.2.1. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified unless excepted by AFI 11-401,
            paragraph 1.12 (Requirements for Pilots in Dual-Controlled Aircraft. Simulated EPs are pro-
            hibited. (EXCEPTION: EPs required for the purposes of a functional check flight are autho-
            rized. In this context, personnel on board are required for mission accomplishment. Limit
            personnel to absolute minimum required.) Other mission events are authorized. Passengers
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                               69


           will be seated with belts fastened during threat maneuvers. Aircraft commanders will ensure
           that supporting forces are briefed on the mission profile and mission events before flight.

6.35. Military Customs Preclearance Inspection Program:
   6.35.1. The military customs program (DOD 5030.49R and AFI 40X) was developed to assist the
   DOD and other US Government agencies in the control of narcotics, contraband, and prohibited agri-
   cultural products, and to expedite entry of DOD personnel and material into the customs territory of
   the United States.
   6.35.2. Military Customs Inspectors will accomplish this inspection immediately prior to departure
   and may conduct more than one preclearance inspection on CONUS bound aircraft. When security
   considerations necessitate deviation from this policy, mission planners must coordinate with the
   appropriate agency to ensure the mission is not jeopardized.

Section 6F—Departure

6.36. Checklists. Accomplish all checklists with strict discipline. A checklist is not complete until all
items are accomplished.
   6.36.1. The pilot flying the aircraft will initiate all checklists unless another procedure is established
   by the flight manual or this volume.
   6.36.2. Carry abbreviated checklists in the USAF flight crew checklist binders. The only pages (or
   inserts) authorized in checklist binders are C-130-series TO aircrew checklists, AFI volume 3 check-
   lists, MAJCOM-approved checklists and briefing guides, and NAF- or OGV-approved information
   guides. Unapproved items must be marked "For Reference Use Only" and may be kept within the
   same checklist binder as authorized checklists. Units may construct locally approved in-flight guides.
   6.36.3. Make personal notes in pencil on checklists and briefing or information guides, if desired.
   Such notes must be current.
   6.36.4. Abbreviated checklist items that do not apply to unit aircraft or mission may be lined out in
   pencil. Do not challenge these items during checklist accomplishment.
   6.36.5. Checklists that apply to specific employment procedures are included as attachments to this
   volume. The pilot or navigator will initiate and the flight engineer will read the tactical checklists.
       6.36.5.1. Amplified Tactical Checklist. Simultaneous or coordinated procedures are arranged in
       parallel columns and chronologically numbered in sequence of the various operations. When an
       amplified checklist item is followed by a crew position designator (for example "P"), that crew-
       member takes action and responds to the checklist challenge.
       6.36.5.2. Abbreviated Tactical Checklist. The cockpit crew checklist is a challenge and
       response checklist. The cockpit crew and loadmaster checklists contain both challenge and
       non-challenge items. Responses to challenge items on the cockpit crew checklist are in quotes.
       Release point and Completion of Drop checklists are initiated by the unchallenged command
       "Green Light" or "Red Light" by the navigator as appropriate. Loadmasters will respond at the
       end of each phase of their checklists without challenge.

6.37. Flight Deck Entry:
70                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


     6.37.1. The following personnel are authorized on the flight deck during takeoff, landing, and critical
     phases of flight. They must be in compliance with paragraph 5.6.2. of this volume.
        6.37.1.1. Additional crewmembers (if seats are not required by primary crewmembers or flight
        examiners).
        6.37.1.2. Individuals approved by the wing or group commander.
     6.37.2. Aircraft commanders may authorize passengers (except patients) to visit the flight deck dur-
     ing noncritical phases of flight. Passenger access to any primary crew position is prohibited.

6.38. TOLD Cards. The flight engineer will complete TOLD cards. A pilot or additional flight engineer
will cross-check the TOLD card for accuracy, by using the performance manual, TOLD computer, or
approved tabulated data.
     6.38.1. Cross-check minimum control, takeoff, and landing speeds. This should be done for the ini-
     tial takeoff, landing, and for significant changes in operating conditions (e.g., flaps up, etc.).
     6.38.2. When performance is critical (e.g., assault operations, high altitudes, etc.) cross-check dis-
     tances and ground rolls for the configuration to be used.

6.39. Departure Briefing. The pilot making the takeoff will brief the crew IAW the flight manual.

6.40. On-Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are considered "on time" if the aircraft is airborne no later
than 0.2 hours after the scheduled takeoff time. Early departures are authorized provided local, down-
range, and aircrew impact are evaluated and no adverse effect will result.

6.41. Power Application. To help prevent overtorques, the flight engineer will make a call over the
interphone any time torque reaches 17,000 in-lb. Pilots and flight engineers will monitor torque as throt-
tles are advanced.

6.42. Departure Monitoring. The navigator and pilot not flying the aircraft will back up the pilot and
report any deviations from the planned departure. When radar facilities are available, departures will be
radar monitored to the maximum extent possible.

Section 6G—En route

6.43. Oxygen Requirements. Aircrew members will comply with the oxygen requirements specified in
AFI 11-202V3.
     6.43.1. Crewmembers occupying a crew station will have an oxygen mask connected and readily
     available for use before engine start and until engine shutdown. Prior to flight, crewmembers will
     accomplish a communications and operations check of their oxygen masks.
     6.43.2. All crewmembers will use supplemental oxygen for flight when the cabin altitude exceeds
     10,000 feet MSL. Walk-around bottles do not satisfy this requirement. When oxygen is not available
     to other non-crewmembers, flight between 10,000 - 13,000 feet MSL is authorized for a maximum of
     3 hours, if required.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                                  71


   6.43.3. Crewmembers who do not have access to the aircraft oxygen system will have a passenger
   oxygen kit (POK) within arm's reach for pressurized flights above FL 250. Prior to flight, visually
   inspect the POK to ensure it contains an adequate supply of oxygen.
   6.43.4. Aircrews required to fly unpressurized missions above 18,000 feet MSL will prebreathe 100
   percent oxygen for a minimum of 30 minutes. Begin prebreathing so that uninterrupted prebreathing
   times are complete before cabin altitude exceeds 10,000 feet. See Table 16.4.

6.44. Flight Progress. Use all available navigational aids to maintain course centerline and positive fix-
ing of the aircraft's position. Immediately report to the controlling ARTCC any malfunction or loss of
navigation capability which degrades center line accuracy.

6.45. Navigation Aid Capability:
   6.45.1. North Atlantic Region and the US West Coast/Hawaii Route System. Aircraft must have
   an operable INS/GPS/SCNS prior to airspace/track entry. Aircraft without this equipment must return
   to a station with maintenance capability or refile via routes specified in FLIP.
   6.45.2. North Pacific (NOPAC) Region. Comply with the following procedures when transiting the
   Anchorage/Tokyo Oceanic CTA/FIRs on the NOPAC north route:
       6.45.2.1. Westbound aircraft on the NOPAC north route experiencing loss of radar capability at
       any point shall, fuel permitting, refile a flight plan on another track or return to the nearest facility
       with radar maintenance capability.
       6.45.2.2. Westbound aircraft on the NOPAC north route that have a single drift and groundspeed
       source and experience loss of that source at any point, may continue the NOPAC north route if the
       radar system is fully operable. Verify in flight that satisfactory returns are being received on all
       ranges, particularly the longer ranges (100 NM or greater). If the radar system is marginal or inop-
       erative, fuel permitting, refile a flight plan to another track or return to the nearest facility with
       maintenance capability.

6.46. CIRVIS (AFM 10-206) and Other Reports. Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as
indicated in the FLIP Planning or Flight Information Handbook (FIH).

6.47. In-flight Meals. The aircraft commander and the copilot will not consume meals within 90 minutes
of each other during flight if the meals were procured from the same vendor and consist of the same menu.

6.48. Communications. Make all communications IAW FLIP or as directed by the controlling agency.

6.49. In-flight Emergency Procedures. Report deviations from directives that occur as a result of an
emergency IAW AFI 11-202V3 and this volume.
   6.49.1. Notification of Controlling Agencies. As soon as practical after completing the aircraft
   emergency action checklist, furnish the controlling agency and appropriate CCC a description and
   extent of the difficulty, assistance required, intentions, and any further pertinent information.
   6.49.2. Emergency Landing. Aircrews must be prepared to divert to the nearest suitable airfield.
   Navigators must be ready to provide pertinent information including headings, distance, and frequen-
   cies.
72                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


     6.49.3. Conference Skyhook/Hotel:
        6.49.3.1. The aircraft commander may initiate the conference when additional expertise is neces-
        sary to cope with emergencies or other conditions. It convenes at the lowest level where expertise
        is available, and will not be elevated for the purpose of keeping the next higher echelon informed.
        6.49.3.2. When in UHF or VHF range, initiate the conference over appropriate discrete frequen-
        cies. When out of VHF or UHF range, use HF radios to establish a phone patch with the nearest
        or controlling CCC. Provide a narrative description of the situation including actions taken, inten-
        tions, and type of expertise desired.
     6.49.4. Turnaround Procedures. When a turnaround is necessary, use procedures in FLIP. Main-
     tain VFR, reverse course, climb or descend to a VFR altitude or flight level and request ATC clear-
     ance. If unable to maintain VFR, obtain an ATC clearance before reversing course. A turnaround
     under IFR conditions, without ATC approval, will be made only after a thorough evaluation of the
     seriousness of the emergency, general traffic density, and known traffic operating in the immediate
     area. Normally, a climb or descent (with minimum change in altitude) to a VFR altitude or flight level
     will result in minimum exposure to other aircraft, if a turnaround is required.

6.50. Continued Flight with Engine Loss. A flight may proceed on three engines to its destination if
two-engine capability exists, favorable operating conditions prevail both en route and at the point of
intended landing, and a suitable alternate airfield is available at all times. If these conditions cannot be
met, the flight will terminate at the nearest facility (preferably military) which, in the judgment of the air-
craft commander, offers safe and favorable operating conditions.

6.51. Fuel Jettisoning. Fuel will not be jettisoned except for combat conditions, emergency conditions,
or rescue missions requiring gross weight reduction.

6.52. Medical Assistance. When a person on board the aircraft requires medical care, the aircraft com-
mander will inform the station of next intended landing in sufficient time so the aircraft may be met by
medical personnel. The request will include the individual's sex, approximate age, and the nature of the
medical problem.

6.53. Weather Forecasts:
     6.53.1. The primary contact for in-flight weather assistance is the Pilot Meteorological Service
     (PMSV).
     6.53.2. For aircraft flying into Europe, the preferred alternate contact for weather information east of
     10 degrees west longitude is through Croughton USAF Global Command and Control Station
     (GCCS) to USAFE Weather Support Unit at Ramstein (USAFE Metro).
     6.53.3. For aircraft flying into the Pacific theater, the preferred alternate contact for weather informa-
     tion west of 140 degrees west longitude is through the USAF GCCS to Hickam AFB, HI.
     6.53.4. When operating outside the CONUS, monitor GCCS weather broadcasts. Times and frequen-
     cies are contained in the FLIP Flight Information Handbook. During contingency operations or exer-
     cises, use GCCS weather broadcasts to support silent ocean crossings.
     6.53.5. Obtain latest weather prior to descent for landing at destination.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                               73


6.54. Low-Level Overwater Operations. The accumulation of salt spray on windshields and side win-
dows is a factor which must be considered for low-level overwater flight. Weigh these factors against
mission urgency prior to descent below 500 feet, when heavy seas or high surface winds exist. In some
cases, it will be preferable to fly at a higher altitude to avoid this hazard.

Section 6H—Arrival

6.55. Crew Coordination. The pilot flying the approach will brief the crew on the descent, approach,
and landing IAW the flight manual. The other pilot and navigator will monitor the approach and report
any deviations from prescribed procedures. Crewmembers will confine their activities to aircraft opera-
tion, descent and approach monitoring, and checklist accomplishment from the initial descent point to
block in. Under no circumstances will crewmembers deviate from these duties except for in-flight emer-
gencies.

6.56. Instrument Approach Minimums. See AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 8, and comply with the following:
   6.56.1. The C-130 is a category "C" aircraft. If approach speeds exceed 140 knots, the minimums for
   Category "D" will be used. DH/MDA, instrument approach visibility and, if required, ceiling mini-
   mums will be as published, with the following exceptions:
       6.56.1.1. If full flight instrumentation is not operational, base DH on a minimum HAT of 300 feet
       and RVR 40, or visibility three-fourths mile if RVR is not available.
       6.56.1.2. Full flight instrumentation for an ILS includes:
           6.56.1.2.1. Dual flight displays (one flight director plus ADI repeat satisfies this requirement).
           6.56.1.2.2. Complete differential pressure instruments, compass/heading reference systems,
           and attitude indicators in the pilot and copilot positions.
           6.56.1.2.3. Full flight instrumentation for a PAR will include: complete differential pressure
           instruments, compass systems/heading reference systems, and attitude indicators in the pilot
           and copilot position.
   6.56.2. Precision Approach. Visibility will be no lower than RVR 24 or one-half mile if RVR is not
   available. DH will be based on a HAT of no less than 200 feet.
   6.56.3. Circling Approach. Minimum descent altitude (MDA) will be as published for category air-
   craft. If the minimums are not published by category, the minimum altitude will be as published, but
   in no case lower than the value indicated below, plus the published airport elevation:
       6.56.3.1. Category C. 500 feet - 1 1/2 SM
       6.56.3.2. Category D. 600 feet - 2 SM
   6.56.4. Aircrews performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0 degress
   centigrade or below will refer to the Flight Information Handbook, section D, Temperature Correction
   Chart, to correct minimum descent altitude (MDA), decision height (DH), and other altitudes inside
   the final approach fix (FAF) if required.

6.57. Weather Below Minimums. See AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 8; and MAJCOM supplements.

6.58. Instrument Approach Procedures:
     6.58.1. Fly instrument approaches to maintain proficiency and to positively identify arrival airports.
     Visual approaches are authorized to maintain visual landing proficiency. Use radar monitoring when
     feasible.
     6.58.2. Fly a precision approach, if available, at night and during marginal weather. If PAR and ILS
     are available, fly one and use the other as a backup. On training and evaluation flights pilots may fly
     nonprecision approaches or VFR traffic patterns to accomplish required training or evaluation
     requirements.
     6.58.3. When a coupled approach is flown, assume manual control at or above published minimum
     altitude (MDA/DH).
     6.58.4. Self-Contained Approaches (SCAs). SCAs are operational procedures not normally
     intended for publication in FLIP. Plan all SCAs IAW aircraft specific planning guidance. Fly navi-
     gator-directed SCAs using ground-based radar monitoring, where available.
        6.58.4.1. All IMC SCAs must be approved by MAJCOM/DO. Submit packages through stan/
        eval channels. Refer to SCA planning paragraph in Chapter 16 for package construction and con-
        tent.
        6.58.4.2. VMC SCAs need not be submitted to higher headquarters for approval.
     6.58.5. The following publications are authorized if an acceptable DOD FLIP (SID or Terminal
     Approach) is not available.
        6.58.5.1. National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Survey.
        6.58.5.2. Host Government Instrument Products. These products must be reviewed by a
        TERPS office and approved by MAJCOM/DO. Approval will include minimums for the
        approach and restrictions applicable to the departure procedure.
        6.58.5.3. Any product not published in a DOD or NOAA FLIP document such as Jeppesens or
        Host Government instrument products are considered published/authorized only after a TERPS
        review and approval by MAJCOM/DO. Overseas units should submit these products to their the-
        ater MAJCOM TERPS office for review. Forward the TERPS office recommendations through
        stan/eval channels to MAJCOM/DO for final approval.
     6.58.6. If the minimum altitude is not adequately depicted on an instrument approach procedure chart
     and terrain clearance is not confirmed by ATC radar, continue to the initial approach fix at or above
     the minimum altitude depicted on the en route chart and complete the descent to the initial approach
     altitude in the holding pattern.

6.59. Radar Altimeter Procedures. Set the radar altimeters to the HAT or HAA for the approach being
flown in accordance with the flight manual. Pilots and navigators will crosscheck radar altimeters during
descent to ensure adequate terrain clearance is provided throughout the descent and maneuvering portion
of the approach. Once established in a VFR traffic pattern, the radar altimeter may be set at the discretion
of the pilot.

6.60. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Pilots must exercise the discipline necessary to ensure wake turbu-
lence avoidance criteria are observed during flight operations. Acceptance of a visual or contact
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                               75


approach clearance, or instructions to follow an aircraft, is acknowledgment that the pilot will maintain a
safe interval for wake turbulence avoidance. The following instructions expand wake turbulence avoid-
ance criteria, but do not replace guidance in DOD FLIP planning.
   6.60.1. For VFR traffic patterns behind jumbo jets, follow the "Vortex Avoidance Procedures" in
   FLIP General Planning.
   6.60.2. Low approaches behind jumbo jets will be flown no lower than that altitude which ensures the
   aircraft remains well above the flight path of the jumbo jet.
   6.60.3. Pilots operating under IFR into US civil airports will request 10 miles or 4 minutes separation
   from jumbo jets (departure and arrival).

Section 6I—Postflight

6.61. Classified Material:
   6.61.1. Turn in authenticators and other classified materials at destination and obtain receipts for clas-
   sified material. CCCs will provide temporary storage for authenticators and classified materials dur-
   ing ground time at en route stops. Issue and turn-in of authenticators normally is a function of base
   operations. At locations where no storage facilities exist, classified materials may be stored in the air-
   craft safe, if the aircraft is so equipped.
   6.61.2. Remove classified information stored in the GPS, INS, or mission computers.
   6.61.3. Clear all TRANSEC systems, such as secure voice and IFF.
   6.61.4. In an emergency, destroy or damage classified material and equipment prior to crash landing
   or bailout, if possible.

6.62. Impoundment. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the aircraft commander
should impound the aircraft immediately after landing and contact the ACC or respsective command cen-
ter or controlling agency for further instructions.

Section 6J—Debriefing

6.63. Maintenance. The aircraft commander and the flight engineer complete the AFTO Form 781.
   6.63.1. The aircraft commander reviews the aircraft forms, determines those discrepancies consid-
   ered as mission essential and indicates them by entering "ME" (mission essential) in block letters in
   the lower left hand corner of the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Docu-
   ment, discrepancy block. Use "MC" (mission contributing) to indicate any discrepancies that, if cor-
   rected, would substantially contribute to mission accomplishment, but are not mission essential.
   6.63.2. Use block 14 (discrepancy) of the AFTO Form 350, Repairable Item Processing Tag, with
   an AFTO Form 781 entry to identify and tag any defective item of equipment such as headsets, ther-
   mos jugs, and sextants.
   6.63.3. Enter "Aircraft subjected to salt spray" on the AFTO Form 781A any time the aircraft is flown
   under 1,000 feet AGL over salt water, excluding takeoffs and landings.
   6.63.4. Ensure fuel onloaded or offloaded during refueling is entered in the AFTO Form 781H.

     6.63.5. Immediately after arrival, the aircraft commander and other pertinent crewmembers debrief
     maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, avionics equipment, and all installed
     special equipment. At stations where there is no ACC maintenance, and maintenance support is
     required, the aircraft commander ensures a thorough debrief is provided to the controlling CCC prior
     to entering crew rest.

6.64. Weather. The aircraft commander or a representative will pass significant information to the appro-
priate weather agency.

6.65. Intelligence. Debrief intelligence when applicable.

6.66. Crew Debriefing. The aircraft commander will conduct a debriefing after each mission. The
debriefing will include all applicable crew members so that common problems can be discussed and
resolved. Crew members may be excused from the debrief at the discretion of the aircraft commander.

6.67. Aircrew Notification Procedures. When transiting installations, the aircraft commander will
establish a point of contact with the command post, base operations, or local airport manager, when the
crew is billeted in off base quarters. The aircraft commander will be notified immediately in case of inci-
dent or emergency affecting the safety or security of the aircraft.

Section 6K—Miscellaneous Procedures

6.68. Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture Inspections:
     6.68.1. Obtain Customs, Agriculture, and Public Health clearance, as required, prior to opening any
     doors, hatches, or windows, other than the crew entrance door, or enplaning and deplaning personnel.
     6.68.2. Proceed directly from the aircraft to Customs, Immigration, or Agricultural inspection for
     processing when required by the inspector.
     6.68.3. US military aircraft are sovereign. When cleared to overfly or land in foreign territory, it is
     US policy to assert that military aircraft are entitled to the privileges and immunities which customar-
     ily are accorded warships. These privileges and immunities include, in the absence of stipulations to
     the contrary, exemption from duties and taxation; immunity from search, seizure, and inspections
     (including customs and safety inspections); or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the
     aircraft, personnel, equipment, or cargo on board. USAF aircraft commanders will not authorize
     search, seizure, inspection, or similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authori-
     ties except by direction of HQ USAF or the American Embassy in the country concerned.
        6.68.3.1. Aircraft commanders will not permit the inspection of their aircraft by officials of any
        foreign government. If requested to do so, the aircraft commander and crew will deny access and
        seek aid from the senior ACC or other USAF representative, US Embassy, or consulate within the
        host nation. Customs or other officials will be informed of the above policy and requested to con-
        firm their request through their own government and with US Department of State representatives.
        If necessary, the aircraft will be sealed by the crew and the crew entered into crew rest, departure
        intentions will be canceled, until resolution of the matter by appropriate authority. Inform com-
        mand and control authorities by the fastest available means should this situation occur.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            77


      6.68.3.2. When confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should consider
      the following procedures:
         6.68.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be stopped by a statement of aircraft com-
         manders to the foreign officials that the aircraft is sovereign and not subject to search without
         consent of HQ USAF or the chief of mission in the country concerned. This should be clearly
         conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign authorities who may honestly, but mis-
         takenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.68.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, aircraft commanders must
         negotiate to delay the search until contact is made with HQ USAF/XOXXI or the appropriate
         embassy. Aircraft commanders should unequivocally state that they have no authority to con-
         sent to the search and that they must relay the foreign request to these agencies for decision.
         Aircraft commanders should then notify these agencies of the foreign request by the most
         expeditious means available. Thereafter, aircraft commanders should follow instructions pro-
         vided by the appropriate embassy and HQ USAF.
         6.68.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, aircraft commanders
         should indicate that they would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel and mechan-
         ical considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission to do so.
         6.68.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way on
         board an aircraft, aircraft commanders should state that they protest the course of action being
         pursued and the they intend to notify both the appropriate American Embassy and HQ USAF
         of the foreign action. Aircraft commanders should then allow the foreign agents on board the
         aircraft, without physical resistance, and thereafter report the incident to HQ USAF and appro-
         priate embassy as soon as possible.
         6.68.3.2.5. In all instances, specific instructions may be briefed because of sensitive cargo or
         equipment. These instructions and applicable provisions of classified supplements to the for-
         eign clearance guide should be followed where applicable.

6.69. Border Clearance:
   6.69.1. Normal Operations:
      6.69.1.1. Border Clearance Responsibility. The border clearance responsibility will be as des-
      ignated by the base or area command IAW AFIs 24-401, 24-402, 24-403, and 24-404; Border
      Clearance, Customs Program; and other United States Entry Requirements and Related Areas.
      6.69.1.2. Aircraft Commander Responsibility. Border clearance is the responsibility of the air-
      craft commander, although many of the duties have been assigned to ground personnel and to the
      loadmaster. The aircraft commander will ensure:
         6.69.1.2.1. Crewmembers and passengers possess current passports and valid visas if
         required.
         6.69.1.2.2. Crewmembers and passengers have current shot records or certificates of immuni-
         zation.
         6.69.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
78                                          AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


           6.69.1.2.4. Departure or arrival to the US is through an air base where border clearance can
           be obtained.
           6.69.1.2.5. Border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and baggage, if required, is
           obtained before takeoff to a foreign area, or after arrival from a foreign area.
           6.69.1.2.6. Aircraft spraying is accomplished, if required (see paragraph 6.70.).
           6.69.1.2.7. En route to the US, the loadmaster has distributed personal customs declarations to
           all passengers and crewmembers; has briefed passengers and crewmembers on customs regu-
           lations in accordance with Chapter 13 of this volume; and has prepared and compiled neces-
           sary border clearance forms for the aircraft commander's signature.
           6.69.1.2.8. En route to the US, the base of intended landing is notified of any change in ETA,
           to ensure border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
           6.69.1.2.9. A Permit to Proceed is obtained when the mission requires an aircraft, which has
           landed in the US for customs clearance, proceed to another US base to obtain border clearance.
           The permit delays customs inspection of cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the off-
           load station, saving intermediate offloading and reloading normally required for customs
           inspection. The Permit to Proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing, where the border
           clearance must be completed, or a new permit obtained. Do not make intermediate stops
           unless required by an emergency situation, or directed by ACC, NGB, or AFRC.
           6.69.1.2.10. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
           normally meets the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane passengers or
           crewmembers, except a scanner, unless necessary for safety. Do not unload until approved by
           customs and agriculture personnel or their designated representatives. This procedure applies
           to the initial landing in the US and all subsequent landings until crew, passengers, and cargo
           complete final border clearance.
     6.69.2. Exercise and Contingency Operations:
        6.69.2.1. General. Certain missions which do not transit normal ports of entry or exit require
        special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health, immigration, and agricul-
        tural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding establishes procedures and waivers.
        6.69.2.2. Implementation. Traffic and border clearing agencies implement all or part of the
        agreement as necessary for each operation. Inspection and clearance may be accomplished at the
        CONUS onload or offload base instead of the normal APOE, or at the foreign onload or offload
        base.
        6.69.2.3. Customs Procedures:
           6.69.2.3.1. Outbound. No requirement. Filing of CC Form 7507, General Declaration
           (Outward/Inward), is waived.
           6.69.2.3.2. Inbound. Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival.
               6.69.2.3.2.1. Customs Form 7507, General Declaration (passenger list not required).
               6.69.2.3.2.2. Cargo manifest.
               6.69.2.3.2.3. For troops out of country less than 140 days.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            79


                  6.69.2.3.2.3.1. Troop commander's certificate for examination of troop baggage.
                  6.69.2.3.2.3.2. One copy of US Customs Declaration for each passenger not under
                  command of the troop commander, to include observers, support personnel, civilians,
                  news reporters, and crewmembers.
                  6.69.2.3.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a Customs representative
                  meets the aircraft and accepts the troop commander's certificate with respect to troop
                  baggage. Individual baggage declarations are not required. The troop commander
                  should have inspected troop baggage. Troops debark under the observation of the Cus-
                  toms representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The Customs
                  officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection.
              6.69.2.3.2.4. For troops who are out of the country 140 days or more:
                  6.69.2.3.2.4.1. One copy of US Customs Declaration for each passenger. This
                  includes observers, support personnel, civilians, news media personnel, and crewmem-
                  bers.
                  6.69.2.3.2.4.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a Customs representative
                  meets the aircraft and collects all declarations. Troops debark under the observation of
                  the Customs representative, who may make discretionary examination of the baggage.
       6.69.2.4. Public Health Procedures:
          6.69.2.4.1. The aircraft commander ensures that all crewmembers and passengers are prop-
          erly immunized.
          6.69.2.4.2. Spray the aircraft, if required (see paragraph 6.70.).
       6.69.2.5. Immigration Procedures:
          6.69.2.5.1. Outbound. No requirements.
          6.69.2.5.2. Inbound. Submit the following to the Immigration inspector:
              6.69.2.5.2.1. One copy of Customs Form 7507, General Declaration (Outward/
              Inward).
              6.69.2.5.2.2. One copy of Immigration Form I-92, Aircraft/Vessel Report.
              6.69.2.5.2.3. One copy/set of Immigration Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, for
              each foreign national.

6.70. Insect and Pest Control (Aircraft Spraying):
   6.70.1. Aircraft commanders will ensure required spraying is accomplished, and certify the spraying
   on Customs Form 7507, or on forms provided by the country transited.
   6.70.2. Spray the aircraft immediately before the last takeoff prior to entering:
       6.70.2.1. The US or its possessions from a foreign airport between 35 degrees north and 35
       degrees south latitude (Japan excluded and all of Africa included).
80                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


            6.70.2.1.1. Aircraft that land in the US north of 35 degrees north latitude need not be sprayed
            between 1 October and 31 March, unless the aircraft will immediately proceed to a part of the
            US located south of 35 degrees north latitude.
            6.70.2.1.2. The US Public Health Service may require spraying of aircraft for emergency pur-
            poses or special requirements (see USAF Foreign Clearance Guide for exceptions).
        6.70.2.2. The state of Hawaii, to include flights from the CONUS.
        6.70.2.3. A foreign area, according to the requirements of the country concerned or of the USAF.
        (See USAF Foreign Clearance Guide for individual country requirements.)
     6.70.3. Use insecticide, Aerosol D-Phenotrin-2%, NSN 6840-1-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray
     the aircraft.
        6.70.3.1. Aerosol normally is dispersed at a flow rate of 10 seconds per 1,000 cubic feet. Direct
        the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being sprayed. Do not spray any plastic
        surface or allow the spray to wet it.
        6.70.3.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely loading fuel, bag-
        gage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments, wheel wells, and other similar
        spaces.
        6.70.3.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the aircraft after the
        crew is on board and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and ventilation openings.
     6.70.4. Spray for 50 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being transited.
     6.70.5. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the aircraft in-flight, notify the destination
     CCC, base operations, or airport manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can
     meet the aircraft.
     6.70.6. Upon arrival, do not open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to
     inspect the aircraft for insect or rodent infestation. Do not onload or offload until the inspection is sat-
     isfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local requirements, as
     arranged by the base air terminal manager.

6.71. Sensitive Mission Operations:
     6.71.1. Certain missions require special flight planning procedures or deceptive measures. Use of
     these procedures will be directed by mission operating directives, COMACC operations orders, or
     other tasking orders. Modification to normal procedures will be fully briefed to aircrews prior to exe-
     cution of the operation. All missions of this type requiring coordination with non-ACC agencies must
     be approved by COMACC or the theater commander prior to execution.
     6.71.2. The planning agency tasked with the mission will provide the aircrew with the following
     information:

        6.71.2.2. En route procedures to include tracks, ALTRV, MARSA, tanker rendezvous, and emer-
        gency divert procedures.
        6.71.2.3. Arrival procedures.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                                81


       6.71.2.4. All communication requirements.

6.72. "Due Regard" Procedures. When a mission has been authorized to be flown in international air-
space and in-flight operational requirements conflict with ICAO rules and procedures, the aircraft com-
mender may make the decision to proceed using "due regard" procedures IAW FLIP General Planning.
Aircraft commanders can only assume "due regard" in international airspace and must understand that in
doing so, they become their own clearance authority for all flight conditions and are, therefore, solely
responsible for maintaining separation from all other aircraft. For that reason, it is essential that aircrews
be completely familiar with the "due regard" guidance outlined in General Planning.

6.73. Hazardous Medical Equipment. See AFI 11-202V3, paragraph 2.5.1.7.

6.74. Hazardous Material Procedures. The term "hazardous material" (reference AFJI 11-204)
includes any material which, because of its quantity, properties, or packaging, may endanger human life
or property. Procedures in this paragraph apply whenever aircraft carry DOD Hazard Class/Division 1.1,
1.2, or 1.3 explosives, DOT Class A and B poisons, etiological or biological research materials, radioac-
tive materials requiring yellow III labels, and inert devices. Also included are DOD Hazard Class/Divi-
sion 1.4 explosives, oxidizers, compressed gases, flammable solids and liquids, and corrosive liquids
listed in AFJMAN 24-204.
   6.74.1. Briefing. Reference AFJMAN 24-204.
   6.74.2. Cargo Documentation. Do not accept hazardous materials unless proper documentation,
   certification, and identification of cargo is provided. This includes transportation control number
   (TCN) entered correctly on both the cargo manifest and the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous
   Goods.
   6.74.3. Flight Planning. The aircraft commander (unless specifically briefed otherwise):
       6.74.3.1. Enters "Hazardous Cargo" and the mission number in the appropriate section of the
       flight plan. Use remarks section of DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan; and other information
       section of DD Form 1801, DOD International Flight Plan; and ICAO Flight Plan Form.
       6.74.3.2. Plans the flight to minimize overflying heavily populated or otherwise critical areas.
       6.74.3.3. Prepares a departure message. The remarks section of the departure message should
       include the following:
           6.74.3.3.1. DOT class and DOD hazard class or division, if applicable, of hazardous material
           on board. (Include net weight of DOT Class A or B poisons and net explosive weight (NEW)
           of Class A or B explosives).
           6.74.3.3.2. Request for special support; e.g., isolated parking, security, technical escort teams,
           etc.
           6.74.3.3.3. Inert devices (when applicable).
       6.74.3.4. If ETE is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances preclude timely receipt at destina-
       tion, notify base operations at the first intended landing, by priority telephone, of the ETA and
       information listed in 6.74.3.3.
82                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


     6.74.4. Before Engine Start. Ensure placards are removed. Give the controlling agency parking
     location, approximate engine start time, and verify that the fire fighting agency has the hazardous
     materials information. If not, request the following be relayed to the fire fighting agency:
        6.74.4.1. DOT class of hazardous material on board and the DOD hazard class or division for
        explosive material on board.
        6.74.4.2. Net Explosive Weight (NEW).
        6.74.4.3. Request for isolated taxiing (if necessary).
        6.74.4.4. Estimated time of departure (ETD).
     6.74.5. En route. Normal procedures apply. Avoid flying over metropolitan or otherwise critical
     areas.
     6.74.6. Before Landing. Accomplish the following unless specifically prohibited by the theater
     commander or FLIP planning.
        6.74.6.1. Contact the base operations dispatcher, control tower, approach control, or other agency
        specified in FLIP at least 30 minutes (or as soon as practical) before ETA to announce that hazard-
        ous materials are on board and to verify that the appropriate base support agencies have received
        the departure message. If not, transmit the mission number, ETA, and information listed in
        6.74.3.3.
        6.74.6.2. If landing at a CONUS civil airport without a tower, give the information in 6.74.6.1. to
        the nearest FAA flight service station.
        6.74.6.3. Request the information be relayed immediately to base operations or the civil airport
        manager, crash or fire protection agency, and other support activities.
     6.74.7. Parking:
        6.74.7.1. DOD requires aircraft carrying DOD Hazard Class or Division 1.1, 1.2, explosives,
        DOT Class A poisons, and certain biological agents and munitions be parked in areas isolated
        from personnel. Aircraft commanders are responsible for ensuring cargo is correctly identified to
        the tower and ground control. When aircraft are not directed to an isolated area, identify the cargo
        again to tower or ground control. When identification is acknowledged, the host is solely respon-
        sible for selecting the parking area. Should host procedures be questionable, submit trip reports or
        HRs, as appropriate, to document such occurrences.
        6.74.7.2. The military host is responsible for placarding aircraft. For non-military installations,
        the briefing to the aircraft commander will include placarding requirements and, if required, plac-
        ards will be furnished at the onload base. The shipper must make prior arrangements with the air-
        port manager for shipments of hazardous materials requiring placarding. The shipper is
        responsible for cargo identification, fire fighting procedures, and isolated parking requirements.
     6.74.8. Unscheduled Landing Due to In-flight Emergency. Transmit unclassified information to
     the appropriate air traffic control facility as follows:
        6.74.8.1. Nature of emergency and intent to land.
        6.74.8.2. Aircraft position and ETA.
        6.74.8.3. Number of personnel and location in aircraft.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             83


       6.74.8.4. Fuel on board.
       6.74.8.5. That hazardous materials are on board, location of the cargo, and applicable information
       listed in 6.74.3.3.
   6.74.9. After Unscheduled Landing. Contact the ACC or respsective command center or theater
   ALCC by telephone, HF radio, or message, giving arrival notice, hazardous materials information,
   and other pertinent information as required.

6.75. Electronic Devices. The use of electronic devices is as specified in AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 2. If
the aircrew detects any interference from a portable eletronic device used aboard the aircraft, the use of
this device will be discontinued for the duration of the flight.
   6.75.1. Portable GPS Units (PGUs). Use only approved PGUs. On aircraft without an integrated
   SCNS-GPS, use the approved PGU on all missions. On those aircraft, if the PGU becomes inoperable
   prior to takeoff from home station or while in flight, make every effort to replace/fix the unit, but do
   not delay mission accomplishment. Reference AFI 11-202V3, paragraph 5.8.3, for addition GPS
   guidance. WARNING: Ensure all batteries are properly installed. Installing even a single battery
   incorrectly will cause the unit to operate for 10 to 30 minutes, followed by battery expansion and rup-
   ture.
   6.75.2. The use of the PGU will not interfere with nor replace the need to perform normal in-flight
   aircrew duties/procedures.
   6.75.3. The KLX-100 is approved at all altitudes and has been approved by the Aeronautical Systems
   Center (ACS/ENCI) for operations during all phases of flight.
       6.75.3.1. All other types of PGUs and laptop computers must be approved IAW AFI 11-202V3.
       6.75.3.2. On aircraft with sextent mount antenna, the antenna may be placed in the sextant mount
       during pre-flight and remain for the duration of the mission. (EXCEPTION: The antenna must
       be removed if celestial procedures are required.)

NOTE:
Leaving the sextant port antenna installed in the sextant mount over time may allow moisture to penetrate
the antenna, causing it to fail. Units should ensure aircrew members remove the antenna and close the
sextant port after each flight.
   6.75.4. The following guidance is mandatory for aircraft without integrated SCNS-GPS installed.
   For other aircraft, PGUs may continue to be used if desired.
       6.75.4.1. If available, the navigator will be the primary PGU operator. On missions without a
       navigator, an aircrew member not flying the aircraft should be the primary PGU operator.
       6.75.4.2. As time and aircraft duties permit, use the PGU present position to cross check on-board
       aircraft systems (SCNS/INS/UNS, radar) and available navaids (TACAN, VOR) to enhance situa-
       tional awareness. It is recommended that the aircraft flight plan, from takeoff to destination,
       including standard instrument departure (if available), be programmed into the PGU during mis-
       sion planning. Once the type of approach to be flown can be reasonably determined, the approach
       path and accompanying missed approach path should be programmed into the PGU prior to com-
       mencing the approach.
84                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


        6.75.4.3. During descent and approach, the operator should monitor PGU information. In IMC
        conditions, if a discrepancy exists between the aircraft approach instrumentation and the PGU
        position, the operator will inform the aircraft commander. The aircraft commander should con-
        sider the reliability of all available information and determine if a missed approach is warranted.

NOTE:
All PGU altitudes should be considered unreliable.
     6.75.5. The PGU will not be used to update navigation equipment (SCNS/INS/UNS) unless the GPS
     position can be confirmed by another aircraft source (e.g., radar, TACAN, VOR, or navigator).
     6.75.6. The VHF radio capability on the KLX-100 is not certified IAW AFI 11-202V3 and will not be
     used in lieu of aircraft radios. Ensure the communications function is disabled prior to use on the air-
     craft.
     6.75.7. Turn off power to the KLX-100 prior to any known power surge (e.g., switching from external
     to aircraft power).

6.76. Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT). SARSAT is an international satellite
system for Search and Rescue (SAR). It consists of a constellation of six satellites in polar orbit and a net-
work of earth stations which provide distress alert and location information to appropriate rescue authori-
ties anywhere in the world for users in distress.
     6.76.1. Ground Segment. The SARSAT ground segment consists of Local User Terminals (LUTs)
     which receive and process alert data information from the satellites, compute the position of the dis-
     tress signal and relay the information to one of thirteen Mission Control Centers (MCC). The MCC in
     turn distributes the information to the appropriate Rescue Coordination Center (RCC), a search and
     rescue point of contact, or another MCC. The MCC reports all SARSAT alert data to the appropriate
     SAR authority. The SARSAT satellites detect beacons broadcasting on 121.5, 243.0, and 406.025
     MHz.
     6.76.2. Frequencies. SARSAT is divided into two systems to detect emergency beacons. The first
     system broadcasts on the 121.5/243.0 MHz frequencies and works with Emergency Locator Transmit-
     ters (ELTs) and Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs) at those frequencies. This
     system is limited to a circular area within a 2,000 mile radius of a ground station. The second system
     on the 406.025 MHz frequency provides monitoring for the entire earth. An analog signal is emitted
     from the 121.5/243.0 MHz beacon, and a digital signal is transmitted from a 406.025 MHz beacon. In
     areas without LUT coverage, signals from 121.5/243.0 MHz beacons cannot be received. However,
     this is not the case with the 406.025 MHz system, as the satellites have a memory unit which stores the
     signals for relay to the next available LUT, giving it a truly global capability.
     6.76.3. Local User Terminals (LUTs). The current SARSAT system consists of 25 LUTs in 14
     countries, including 4 in the United States. Although 121.5/243.0 MHz LUT coverage is nearly
     worldwide, much of the southern hemisphere, including most of the African continent, is not covered.
     During contingencies in those areas, mission planners should be aware that the RCC at Langley AFB
     maintains two LUTs which may be deployed. The deployable unit is a camper-sized van and antenna
     trailer designed for transport worldwide aboard cargo aircraft.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                                  85


6.77. Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) or Ground Collision Avoidance System
(GCAS). The following escape maneuvers and flight crew procedures apply to aircrews flying aircraft
equipped with GPWS or GCAS:
   6.77.1. At night, unaided or in IMC, if an aural (either a partial or full "whoop whoop - pull up") or
   visual low altitude warning is received, the following escape maneuver will be accomplished:
       6.77.1.1. Departure/Approach. Immediately and simultaneously rotate the aircraft to at least 7
       degrees pitch-up, roll wing level and add maximum power to alter the aircraft's flight path until the
       warning has ceased and adequate terrain clearance is verified. If required, rotate the aircraft to
       maintain a maximum climb angle (flaps up - no less than flaps up approach speed; flaps 50 - 100
       percent - no slower than obstacle clearance speed).
       6.77.1.2. En route. Immediately and simultaneously rotate the aircraft to at least 7 degrees
       pitch-up, roll wings level and add maximum power to alter the aircraft's flight path until the warn-
       ing has ceased and adequate terrain clearance is verified. If required, rotate the aircraft to maintain
       a maximum climb angle (flaps up - no less than 160 KIAS; flaps 50 - 100 percent - no slower than
       130 KIAS).
       WARNING: Do not delay pull-up for diagnosis of the low altitude warning.
       WARNING: Crewmembers will back up the pilot who is performing the escape maneuver. The
       flight engineer and pilot not flying the aircraft will confirm escape maneuver is being properly
       flown. The navigator will use all available means to verify altitude and ensure terrain clearance.
       WARNING: Failure to roll wings level prior to slowing to the prescribed speeds above will
       decrease stall margin at heavy aircraft gross weights.

NOTE:
When flaps are 100 percent, consider raising the flaps to 50 percent once a positive rate of climb is estab-
lished and appropriate airspeed exists to decrease drag and increase climb profile. Likewise, when flaps
are up, consider lowering the flaps to 50 percent to increase lift and the stall margin. Accomplishing these
steps parallels normal go-around flap operation procedures.
   6.77.2. For operations in day or night NVG VMC conditions, with terrain and obstacles clearly in
   sight, the pilot flying the aircraft will call runway and/or terrain in sight, state intentions, and visually
   clear terrain.
   6.77.3. Ensure the proper mode of the GPWS/GCAS is commensurate with the aircraft's phase of
   flight.

6.78. TCAS/ETCAS Resolution Advisories:
   6.78.1. It is imperative to follow resolution advisories (RA) to obtain aircraft separation computed by
   TCAS/ETCAS. Failure to follow the computed RA may increase the probability of a midair collision.
   Always attempt to visually clear the airspace before maneuvering your airplane in response to a
   TCAS/ETCAS advisory.
   6.78.2. Advise ATC as soon as practical when a deviation becomes necessary due to a TCAS/ETCAS
   resolution advisory.

                                                  Chapter 7

                                          AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This provides guidance on aircraft security and unlawful seizure (hijacking) of ACC air-
craft. Aircrews must make every reasonable effort to resist an aircraft hijacking. Resistance may vary
from dissuasion to direct physical confrontation, including the use of weapons. Aircrews will not release
information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members to the public.

7.2. Security. ACC aircraft are priority C resources when they are not configured for special mission
requirements. This security priority designation applies to operational aircraft, wherever they may be
located, worldwide. Some aircraft contain equipment and documents which require protection per DOD
5200.1/AFI 31-401. Requirements for protection of the aircraft in a transient status at US and foreign
bases are found in DOD 5200.1 and AFI 31-401.

7.3. Procedures. The planning agency must ensure that adequate en route security is available. Aircraft
commanders are best able to determine what protection is needed. The amount of protection required will
vary, depending on the location and ground time. Aircraft commanders will receive a threat assessment
and security capability evaluation briefing at home station, and receive updates at en route stops. When
planning to use overseas exclusively civilian airfields, refer to Table 7.1., Aircraft Force Protection Risk
Assessment Matrix, for guidance. During scheduled and unscheduled landings at non-USAF installa-
tions, aircraft commanders will assess the situation and take the following actions, if security appears
insufficient:
     7.3.1. Area Patrol. Request area patrol coverage from local security forces to include back up
     response forces. If local authorities request payment for this service, use AF Form 15, United States
     Air Force Invoice.
     7.3.2. Aircrew Surveillance. Direct armed crewmembers to remain with the aircraft and maintain
     surveillance over aircraft entrances and activities in the vicinity of the aircraft. Acquire a means to
     report suspicious or hostile activity to security forces (e.g., land mobile radio or other means).
     7.3.3. Departure without Crew Rest. If local security forces are unacceptable or unavailable and
     the crew is not augmented with security police, the aircraft commander may waive crew duty time
     limitations and depart as soon as possible for a base listed as reliable. If unable to depart the location
     due to system malfunction, coordinate through home base channels to acquire security police support.
     7.3.4. Unauthorized Entry. If, in the aircraft commander's judgment, the aircraft needs to be locked
     and sealed to detect unauthorized entry:
        7.3.4.1. Use the aircraft lock.
        7.3.4.2. If the aircraft lock is not available, secure the hatches and doors in a manner that will
        indicate unauthorized entry; for example, tape inside hatch release handles to the airframe, so that
        entry pulls the tape loose. Close and seal the main crew entrance door or left paratroop door using
        a metal box car or other controllable device to identify forced entry. Wipe the immediate area
        around the seal clean to help investigate forced entry. If the seals are damaged or have been tam-
        pered with, notify the appropriate local authorities, the controlling agency, and inspect the aircraft
        thoroughly.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              87


       7.3.4.3. Coordinate with the local base operations representative on procedures for servicing the
       aircraft while the crew is away. If a padlock is used, the key or combination will be left with base
       operations or the representative for personnel required to service or perform maintenance inside
       the aircraft.

7.4. Protective Standards for Aircraft Carrying Distinguished Visitors (DV). T h i s p a r a g r a p h
applies specifically to aircraft transporting DVs Code 4 or above. Aircraft commanders are responsible
for aircraft security at en route stops.
   7.4.1. DOD Installations. Notify the base security police of estimated arrival and departure times.
   Request continuous security surveillance during the entire ground time. If the installation is unable to
   comply, arrange for the best protection available.
   7.4.2. Non-DOD Installations. Contact the airport manager or installation commander to arrange
   for aircraft security. If available security is inadequate, purchase additional security using AF Form
   15.
   7.4.3. Locking or Sealing. Lock the aircraft during all missions remaining over night (RON).

7.5. Arming of Crewmembers. When directed, at least one crewmember on the flight deck and one
crewmember in the cargo compartment will carry weapons for anti-hijacking purposes. All crewmembers
will be armed at any time at the direction of the squadron commander.
   7.5.1. Issue. Before departing home station, authorized crewmembers will obtain weapons, ammuni-
   tion, lock, and key. Crewmembers must present a current AF Form 523, USAF Authorization To
   Bear Firearms, to be issued a weapon. Crewmembers will be reissued the same weapon until the
   mission terminates at home station. If an armed crewmember must leave the crew en route, transfer
   the weapon to another authorized crewmember, using AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
   7.5.2. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing barrels if
   available. To transfer a loaded weapon to another crewmember, place the weapon on a flat surface.
   Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer.
   7.5.3. Wearing of Weapons. Wear anti-hijack weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to protect
   the identity of armed crewmembers. Do not wear weapons off the flight line, except to and from the
   CCC, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities such as base operations, fleet
   service, cargo or passenger terminals, flight line cafeterias, snack bars, etc.
   7.5.4. Weapons Storage In-flight. Crewmembers will be armed before beginning preflight or
   onload duties. When no passengers are on board and after a satisfactory stowaway check, weapons
   may be stored in the gun box in-flight. Crewmembers will rearm before landing. Weapons need not
   be unloaded before being placed in the gun box. Weapons will be worn at all times in contested or
   hostile airspace.
   7.5.5. Crew Rest. During crew rest, store weapons in the most secure facility available, normally the
   base armory. If a weapons storage facility is unavailable or the country prohibits or restricts the entry
   of weapons, secure firearms and ammunition in the gun box.
   7.5.6. Aircraft Without a Gun Box. If an aircraft without a gun box must remain overnight at a
   location where a government owned storage facility is unavailable, use the nearest acceptable facility.
   Acceptable storage facilities are US or Allied military services armories US National Guard and
88                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


     Reserve armories, and US civil law enforcement armories. If none of these are available, or the air-
     craft commander believes weapons, security may be compromised, crewmembers may secure the
     weapons in their quarters, but one crewmember must remain with the weapons. In this case, turn the
     ammunition over to the aircraft commander.

7.6. General Hijacking Guidance. The hijacking of an ACC aircraft could create a serious international
incident and jeopardize the safety of passengers and property. An aircraft is most vulnerable when the
crew is on board and the aircraft is ready for flight. Hijackers cannot be dealt with as ordinary criminals.
Some are mentally disturbed, emotionally unstable individuals for whom the threat of death is not a deter-
rent, but a stimulus to crime. Delay tactics have been most successful in saving lives and property. Crews
must resist all attempts to hijack their aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple discouragement to direct
physical attack with weapons. Detection of potential hijackers before they board the aircraft is the best
solution to the problem.
     7.6.1. Acceptance of Passengers. The host station passenger processing and manifesting facility
     should conduct antihijacking inspections. Do not board passengers unless the aircraft commander is
     fully satisfied with these inspections. EXCEPTION: Supporting/supported forces may be antihijack
     inspected at the aircraft by the aircrew.
     7.6.2. Aeromedical Procedures. Medical facility commanders are responsible for antihijacking
     inspection of patients. When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will
     perform required inspections before departure.
     7.6.3. Contingency and JA/ATT Movements. During exercises or contingencies in support of com-
     bat operations involving the movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should
     manifest passengers and perform an antihijacking inspection.
     7.6.4. Arms and Ammunition. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or
     in hand-carried baggage on board an aircraft except special agents and guards of the Secret Service or
     State Department, and other individuals specifically authorized to carry weapons.
        7.6.4.1. Take every precaution to prevent accidental discharge of weapons. If guards or couriers
        must clear their weapons, ask them to:
            7.6.4.1.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or personnel
            before unholstering or unslinging their weapons.
            7.6.4.1.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures.
        7.6.4.2. Troops and deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an aircraft
        but will turn it in to the troop commander or aircraft commander. Troops may carry unloaded
        weapons and ammunition on board the aircraft during combat operations. When the situation dic-
        tates, weapons may be loaded at the order of the troop commander or team leader.

7.7. Ground Resistance. When the aircraft is on the ground, well planned and executed actions by
ground forces and the crew provide the best opportunities to thwart a hijacking. Crewmembers (including
ACMS) will know who is armed.
     7.7.1. Initial Action. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground forces and the air-
     crew to evaluate the situation and coordinate their efforts.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              89


   7.7.2. Communications. Establish communications with ground agencies using radios, IFF/SIF
   equipment, or any covert means available.
   7.7.3. Delaying Actions. Continue to delay until, in the judgment of the aircraft commander, further
   delay may result in homicidal attempts by the hijacker.
   7.7.4. Positive Detainment. The aircraft will be detained or disabled when:
       7.7.4.1. Requested by the aircraft commander.
       7.7.4.2. Nuclear weapons are on board.
       7.7.4.3. Directed by COMACC or higher for national security.
   7.7.5. Local Procedures. The aircraft commander will review local ground support antihijacking
   procedures at en route bases before departure.

7.8. In-flight Resistance. After an aircraft is airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking attempt depends
on the resourcefulness of the crew. Take advantage of any opportunity to regain control of the aircraft or
influence the conduct of the flight.
   7.8.1. If the hijacker does not permit the use of the radio and the aircraft is under positive control of
   an ATC facility, attempt to communicate by using the IFF/SIF.
   7.8.2. Notify crew and passengers of the situation as soon as practical for maximum assistance
   against the hijacker.
   7.8.3. Be as negative to all the hijacker's demands as possible. Initial response to the hijacker should
   leave the issue in doubt. Try to calm the hijacker. Get the hijacker to talk.
   7.8.4. Convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary for fuel, maintenance, or other prob-
   lems and these stops must be at US military installations because of incompatibility of fuel and start-
   ing units at other airfields. After landing, try to discharge passengers. Use ground forces to regain
   control of the aircraft.
   7.8.5. Give reasons for not complying with the hijacker's demands; for example, inability to commu-
   nicate with foreign sources (radio frequency or language problem), dangers from surface-to-air mis-
   siles, antiaircraft fire, or armed intercept by hostile aircraft.
   7.8.6. Propose favorable alternatives; for example, landing in a neutral rather than unfriendly nation.
   7.8.7. As a last resort:
       7.8.7.1. Simulate emergencies to deceive the hijacker into believing a forced landing is necessary.
       7.8.7.2. Depressurize at altitude to immobilize the hijacker.
       WARNING: Since the hijacker's symptoms of hypoxia are unpredictable, this procedurecould
       have serious consequences.
       7.8.7.3. Use weapons against the hijacker.

7.9. Covert Communications. If in-the-clear radio transmissions are not possible:
90                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


     7.9.1. To report "Am being hijacked," set transponder to Mode 3, Code 7500. When unable to change
     the transponder setting or when not under radar control, transmit a radio message which includes the
     phrase, "(aircraft call sign) transponder seven five zero zero."
     7.9.2. Controllers will acknowledge Code 7500 by asking the pilot to verify it. An affirmative
     response or no reply from the pilot indicates confirmation. Controllers will not ask further questions;
     they will flight follow, respond to pilot requests, and notify appropriate authorities.
     7.9.3. After the start of a hijacking, the aircrew may indicate to the air traffic controller that
     in-the-clear communications are not possible (the hijacker is in the cockpit) by using the word "TRIP"
     after the aircraft call sign prefix (KING "TRIP" 33). The controller should respond using the word
     "TRIP" in the aircraft call sign. Use of the word "TRIP" in the aircraft call sign by the controller prior
     to its use by the aircrew asks the aircrew if clear communications are possible. In this situation, the
     aircrew response should include the word "TRIP" only if clear communications are not possible.
     After an aircrew has advised ATC that clear communications are not possible, ATC will limit radio
     transmissions to the minimum essential ATC functions until advised otherwise by the aircrew.
     7.9.4. When controllers receive a hijacking report in the clear, they assign Code 7500 to the aircraft.
     The pilot may still change to Code 7700 later, if necessary.
     7.9.5. To report "Situation appears desperate; want armed intervention," change from Code 7500 to
     7700. When unable to change the transponder setting or when not under radar control, transmit ,(air-
     craft call sign) transponder seven seven zero zero."
        7.9.5.1. Remain on 7500 for at least 3 minutes or until receiving controller confirmation of Code
        7500 from the controller, whichever is sooner, before changing to Code 7700.
        7.9.5.2. Controllers treat aircraft squawking Code 7700 and not in radio contact with the ground
        as having an in-flight emergency and will follow their appropriate emergency procedures.
     7.9.6. To report "Situation still desperate; want armed intervention and aircraft immobilized," leave
     full flaps down after landing or lower full flaps while on the ground and transmit ,"(aircraft call sign)
     flaps are down."
     7.9.7. To report "Leave alone-do not intervene," retract flaps after landing and transmit, (aircraft call
     sign) flaps are retracted." Pilots who retract flaps after squawking Code 7700 should return to Code
     7500 and remain on Code 7500 for the next leg of the hijacked flight unless the situation changes
     again. Transmit, "(aircraft call sign) back on seven five zero zero" to emphasize that intervention is no
     longer desired.

7.10. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace:
     7.10.1. Procedures. Procedures in this paragraph should prevent hostile actions against an aircraft
     which penetrates the boundary of an unfriendly nation as a result of a hijacking. Comply with instruc-
     tions received by radio or from an interceptor. Without instructions, comply with the following before
     entering unfriendly airspace:
        7.10.1.1. Maintain an altitude between 10,000 and 25,000 feet MSL, if possible.
        7.10.1.2. Fly the most direct course to the destination demanded by the hijacker,unless the
        hijacker insists on another route.
        7.10.1.3. Transmit MAYDAY on 243.0, 121.5, or 2182.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                           91


      7.10.1.4. Squawk Mode 3, Code 7700.
   7.10.2. Destruction of Classified Material. Try to destroy all classified documents and equipment
   on board the aircraft before landing in an unfriendly nation.

7.11. Aircraft Force Protection Risk Assessment:
   7.11.1. Planners and Aircraft Commanders may use the matrix in Table 7.1. to help assess the risk to
   parked aircraft when located at overseas civilian airfields. A cumulative score of less than 55 indi-
   cates that normal unmanned aircraft security measures are adequate. A score of 55 to 80 indicates that
   adequate security is provided by deployed US ground personnel working 24 hour operations. If the
   cumulative score is greater than 80, or if any of the shaded areas in the figure are applicable, com-
   manders should consider deploying or contracting security personnel. During unscheduled or emer-
   gency landings, the aircraft commander should contact the US Embassy or USDAO for security
   assistance.

      RESCUE HC/MC-130 COMMON REFUELING AND FORMATION PROCEDURES

Section 8A—Receiver Air Refueling (AR) Procedures

8.1. General. For this section, "receiver" refers to the Rescue HC/MC-130s (as applicable). "Tanker"
refers to the KC-10/135. T.O.1-1C-1 and T.O.1-1C-1-29 provide the basic guidance for refueling termi-
nology and procedures. This section provides additional guidance and establishes procedures for air refu-
eling. Use an en route overtaking rendezvous for this operation. Minimize lighting and radio calls, and
use only non-emitting equipment (i.e., INS, VOR, ADF, etc.) for the rendezvous.

NOTE:
This section is for future use and applies to aircraft modified with USARSSI.

8.2. Policy. The following policies apply:
   8.2.1. Refueling will only be accomplished by an AR qualified pilot, or a pilot in training under the
   supervision of an instructor.
   8.2.2. Use manual boom latching procedures only during fuel emergencies and contingency opera-
   tions. EXCEPTION: Manual boom latching procedures are authorized for all refueling operations
   with the KC-10A if the tanker's independent disconnect system (IDS/FLIR [some airplanes]) is oper-
   ational.
   8.2.3. During refueling operations, do not make any HF radio transmissions or electronic counter-
   measure (ECM) emissions. IRCM pods may be left in OPERATE mode.

8.3. Altitude Reservations (ALTRV). Whenever practical, air refueling operations are done on tracks or
anchor areas published in the DOD Flight Information Publication (FLIP). ALTRVs are used when certain
missions or operational considerations may require air refueling operations in areas not published in FLIP.
   8.3.1. General:
       8.3.1.1. ALTRVs may include all or parts of the route. Aircraft operating on an ALTRV must
       operate within the altitude, time, and end air refueling (EAR) boundaries specified. Refer to FAA
       Special Military Operations 7610.4H, 3, for Altitude Reservation (ALTRV) Procedures.
       8.3.1.2. The mission must be airborne within a specified time period. The end of this time period
       is the assigned void time, which is 30 minutes after ALTRV published departure time, unless oth-
       erwise specified. This ensures separation between aircraft.
       8.3.1.3. If a mission is delayed beyond the assigned void time, rescheduling normally is by
       24-hour increments based on the original departure time. Exceptions require the concurrence of
       the central altitude reservation function (CARF) and affected air traffic control (ATC) agencies.
       8.3.1.4. An ALTRV does not preclude ATC from using ALTRV airspace provided standard sepa-
       ration is maintained between all aircraft.
   8.3.2. ALTRV Format. The approved message will contain:
94                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


        8.3.2.1. Mission code designator or nickname, as required.
        8.3.2.2. Aircraft call signs.
        8.3.2.3. Number and type aircraft and equipment suffix (transponder code).
        8.3.2.4. Point of departure and destination.
        8.3.2.5. Route of flight, including altitude and departure procedures (SID, name or number).
            8.3.2.5.1. Control points and times.
            8.3.2.5.2. Climb, descent, and level-off points.
            8.3.2.5.3. Direction of turns.
        8.3.2.6. General information:
            8.3.2.6.1. Estimated time of departure (ETD).
            8.3.2.6.2. Cell identification.
            8.3.2.6.3. Interval between aircraft (ADMIS).
            8.3.2.6.4. Assigned void time, if other than 30 minutes.
        8.3.2.7. Additional information:
            8.3.2.7.1. TAS for cruise, air refueling, and low level.
            8.3.2.7.2. Call signs of supporting tankers.
            8.3.2.7.3. MARSA information.
            8.3.2.7.4. Air defense radar information.
            8.3.2.7.5. Individual flight planning from this point (IFPFP) information upon leaving the
            ALTRV.
            8.3.2.7.6. Any limitations of navigational equipment or communication capability.
     8.3.3. Filing:
        8.3.3.1. An ALTRV approval includes a complete description of the route, including altitudes to
        be flown. When filing a DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, this information need not be
        repeated in the route of flight portion of the flight plan. When filing a DD Form 1801, DOD
        International Flight Plan, this information is repeated in the route of flight portion. In either
        case, include the term ALTRV plus the nickname or code name of the ALTRV in the remarks sec-
        tion of the flight plan.
        8.3.3.2. If the ALTRV is to a point short of destination, the route of flight after the ALTRV must
        be identified on the flight plan, even though the ALTRV approval includes a requested routing
        from the end of the ALTRV. To complete the route of flight, enter the nickname or code name of
        the ALTRV, immediately followed by the end ALTRV coordinates or fix, and the subsequent route
        description.
     8.3.4. MARSA:
        8.3.4.1. Acceptance of MARSA normally is the tanker's responsibility. Normally MARSA
        begins prior to the receiver reaching the RZIP. When a rendezvous is conducted in an area that
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              95


       does not use normal track or anchor procedures, MARSA begins when participating aircraft enter
       the refueling airspace.
       8.3.4.2. MARSA ends when normal separation standards are established and ATC accepts control
       at the end of refueling.

8.4. Planning Factors. Mission planners will provide the aircrews with coordinates for the entry point
(EP), rendezvous initial point (RZIP), air refueling control point (ARCP), and air refueling exit point
(AREX) (see Table 8.1.). When a published track is used, the EP is always 20 NM prior to the published
IP.

   8.4.1. Primary control time will be the time the receiver arrives at the RZIP. This is designated the
   rendezvous control time (RZCT). The air refueling control time (ARCT) is the time the receiver
   crosses the air refueling control point (ARCP) and is used as the emergency or missed rendezvous ref-
   erence time.
   8.4.2. Lowest usable air refueling altitude is 3,000 feet above the highest obstacle within 4 NM of
   course centerline.
   8.4.3. Parallel tracks must be separated by at least 30 NM.
   8.4.4. Elements in the stream must have at least 10 minutes separation.
   8.4.5. Do not plan to refuel in areas of forecast severe turbulence or where forecast visibility at refu-
   eling altitude is less than 1 mile.

8.5. C-130 In-flight Refueling Procedures:
   8.5.1. Lighting:
       8.5.1.1. Tanker Lighting:
           8.5.1.1.1. Director lights - bright.
           8.5.1.1.2. Boom nozzle and boom marker lights - bright.
           8.5.1.1.3. Underwing illumination lights - bright.
           8.5.1.1.4. All lights will remain bright until the receiver is approaching the precontact posi-
           tion. At this time, director lights and underwing illumination lights will go to the normal refu-
           eling settings. Tail mounted flood lights may be used. All other lights will remain off.
       8.5.1.2. Receiver Lighting:
           8.5.1.2.1. Slipway lights - bright.
96                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


            8.5.1.2.2. Area lights - bright.
            8.5.1.2.3. IR rotating/combat beacon - on.
            8.5.1.2.4. All lights will remain bright until the receiver visually acquires the tanker and is
            certain the tanker will not be lost prior to contact. The IR rotating/combat beacon will be
            turned off for 10 seconds upon hearing TALLY HO from the tanker. Approaching the precon-
            tact position, the IR rotating/combat beacon will be turned off and the slipway lights and area
            lights will be set for normal refueling operations. Position lights will remain on during all
            training missions. All other lights will be off.
     8.5.2. Rendezvous Procedures. Use en route overtaking rendezvous. Both tanker and receiver will
     monitor primary air refueling frequency (secure) 30 minutes prior to the RZCT. Limit transmissions
     unless operational requirements dictate otherwise.
        8.5.2.1. Tanker:
            8.5.2.1.1. At the EP, ensure external lighting is set.
            8.5.2.1.2. Upon visual contact with the receiver and in a position to complete the rendezvous,
            the tanker will transmit TALLY HO (secure). The tanker will go to plain (nonsecure) on the
            primary refueling frequency as the receiver approaches the precontact position.
            8.5.2.1.3. If JUDY is heard from the receiver, the tanker will acknowledge by turning the
            lower rotating beacon on then off and, during training and exercises, transmitting the numeric
            part of their call sign (secure), slow to refueling airspeed, and proceed down track. They will
            switch to plain (non-secure) as the receiver approaches precontact.
        8.5.2.2. Receiver:
            8.5.2.2.1. At the EP, the receiver will be at the rendezvous altitude at 215 KIAS and ensure
            outside lighting is set. Plan to arrive at the RZIP at the RZCT.
            8.5.2.2.2. Upon hearing the tanker call TALLY HO, turn off the IR rotating beacon for 10 sec-
            onds and, during training and exercises, transmit the numeric part of their call sign (secure).
            Approaching precontact, switch to plain (non-secure) and adjust outside lighting according to
            paragraph 8.5.1.2.4.
            8.5.2.2.3. Should the tanker pass the receiver and advance to a position in front of the receiver
            without calling TALLY HO, and if the receiver is in position to complete the rendezvous, the
            receiver lead will transmit JUDY on the secure primary refueling frequency. The receiver then
            moves to the precontact position and switches to the primary refueling frequency (nonsecure)
            approaching the precontact position.
     8.5.3. Control Time Adjustment:
        8.5.3.1. If the tanker is notified of a revised receiver ETA prior to crossing the RZIP, the tanker
        will adjust timing to arrive at the RZIP at the revised RZCT.
        8.5.3.2. If notified after passing the RZIP, the tanker will continue to the ARCP and hold.
        8.5.3.3. Plan on making an en route overtaking rendezvous at the RZIP based on the new RZCT.
     8.5.4. Communication:
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             97


       8.5.4.1. During all air refuelings, the aircraft commander will designate one crewmember as pri-
       mary monitor for the controlling agency radio frequency. This crewmember will be responsible
       for writing down any clearance issued to the tanker for the receiver aircraft. The aircraft com-
       mander will ensure the receiver and the tanker are on the same frequency.
       8.5.4.2. After receiving the ATC clearance from the tanker, but prior to reading the clearance back
       to the tanker, the aircraft commander will compare this clearance with the one copied down by the
       primary monitor. If there is a difference, the receiver will query the tanker regarding the discrep-
       ancy.
   8.5.5. Post Strike Rendezvous Procedures. For missions that do not have a firm RZCT, a control
   time window will be established. This provides the tanker with a block time for the RZCT. Tankers
   will arrive at the RZIP no later than the beginning of the block time and hold, using 2-minute legs and
   left-hand turns. The receiver, while en route to the rendezvous and NLT 10 minutes from the RZIP,
   will call the tanker (secure) with the revised RZCT. The tanker will adjust orbit to make an en route
   overtaking rendezvous at the revised RZCT.
   8.5.6. Completion of Refueling:
       8.5.6.1. The tanker will plan to offload the prebriefed transfer load.
       8.5.6.2. Upon transfer of the planned onload, the receiver will initiate a normal disconnect and
       close the UARRSI door.
       8.5.6.3. If more fuel is required, leave the UARRSI door open and return to the precontact posi-
       tion.

8.6. Emergency Procedures:
   8.6.1. Breakaway Procedures:
       8.6.1.1. Tanker. The tanker will flash the receiver director lights as the primary indication for a
       breakaway. The lower rotating beacon will be turned on as an additional signal. A radio call will
       be used as the last resort. When the tanker is ready to resume refueling, the lower rotating beacon
       will be turned off.
       8.6.1.2. Receiver. Initiate a breakaway when conditions warrant. Resume refueling when the
       tanker is ready.
   8.6.2. Missed Rendezvous Procedures. See T.O. 1-1C-1-29.

Section 8B— Tanker Helicopter Air Refueling (HAR) Procedures (HC/MC-130)

8.7. General. The purpose of this section is to establish procedures for air refueling under circumstances
requiring low altitude and terrain masking at night or certain day operations (environment permitting).
The term "tanker" in this section refers to HC/MC-130 aircraft and the term "receiver" refers to helicop-
ters equipped for helicopter air refueling.

8.8. HAR Altitudes. Helicopter air refueling will not be conducted below a 1,000 AGL on normal train-
ing missions.

8.9. Assumptions:
98                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


     8.9.1. Lead helicopter will normally be 300 feet below refueling altitude for join-up.
     8.9.2. A minimum of two tankers (primary and spare) should be launched to support large helo for-
     mations (three or more helicopters). A large group of receivers (five or more) should be broken into
     an Option 2 formation so each group will have a primary tanker.
     8.9.3. Refueling altitudes below 1,000 feet AGL may be required due to the threat environment or
     weather conditions on actual rescues or combat missions. Use the following procedures. These are
     similar to normal procedures except the rendezvous and join up is conducted below 1,000 feel AGL to
     avoid threat detection and ensure force survivability. Modifications to the normal procedures are:
        8.9.3.1. Planned Refueling Altitudes:
            8.9.3.1.1. Day Operations. 500 feet AGL minimum.
            8.9.3.1.2. NVG Operations. Compute air refueling altitudes at 500 feet AGL within 3 NM of
            the air refueling/flight planned track.
            WARNING: Low altitude HAR (below 1,000 feet AGL) assumes permissive terrain and is
            not normally possible at night with unaided vision.
            8.9.3.1.3. Final refueling altitude is determined by the threat environment, but in no case will
            it be lower than 300 feet above the receivers' minimum en route altitude capability.
            8.9.3.1.4. Low Altitude HAR Training. Low altitude HAR training (below 1,000 feet AGL)
            requires MAJCOM/DO approval. The intent of such training is to provide tanker and helicop-
            ter crews with exposure to the low altitude HAR environment. These procedures should not
            be utilized for routine training operations. Low altitude HAR training will not be conducted at
            tanker gross weights above 130,000 pounds or without a three-engine climb capability of at
            least 500 fpm.
     8.9.4. The environment may negate the use of systems that emit electronic signals outside the aircraft;
     however, during training and whenever the environment allows, the radar, APX-65 IFF interrogator
     (some airplanes), TCAS/E-TCAS, air-to-air TACAN, UHF or VHF radio communications, and DF
     steers may be used.
     8.9.5. An ARIP will be established a minimum of 6 nautical miles prior to the ARCP. This point is
     part of the HAR track and aids in identifying the receiver and determining their heading.

8.10. Covert Helicopter Air Refueling Procedures:
     8.10.1. Planning:
        8.10.1.1. HAR Tracks and Loiter Areas. Loiter areas, if required, and HAR tracks should be
        located in the safest areas available. Consider the following when determining HAR track length:
        the ARCP is normally the earliest point the tanker can pass abeam the receiver, not when fuel is
        flowing; amount of fuel to be transferred; fuel transfer rate (use 1,000 pounds per minute); number
        of tankers and receivers; hose time per receiver (varies from 2 to 10 minutes); and groundspeed. It
        is not advisable to plan simultaneous contacts. The width of the area will vary with the nature of
        the terrain and the recycling requirements. Planners should consider a minimum altitude of 1,000
        feet AGL for a single-ship and add 500 feet for each additional tanker element to allow maneuver-
        ing and recycling of tanker aircraft on the HAR track. These minimums may be lowered if unlim-
        ited interplane communications are authorized or the threat dictates. Loiter areas may be used
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             99


     when the environment permits. It is desirable to use multiple loiter areas to avoid overflying the
     same terrain or area any more than is absolutely necessary. The primary consideration for select-
     ing loiter areas will be the threat environment. Loiter patterns and ingress headings will be
     adjusted as necessary to arrive at the ARIP at a time and heading that ensure an orderly join-up at
     the ARCP at the ARCT.
     8.10.1.2. To facilitate ARCT control, use the following planning procedures unless specific mis-
     sion requirements or restrictions dictate otherwise. Select an ARIP 6 miles prior to the ARCP.
     Receivers should be at the ARIP 3 minutes prior to ARCT inbound at approximately 110-120
     KIAS, placing both aircraft in position for rendezvous at the ARCP.
     8.10.1.3. Emergency refueling or refueling on other than the preplanned HAR track will be con-
     sidered during planning. As a minimum, the plan will include:
        8.10.1.3.1. Method of notification (i.e., secure voice).
        8.10.1.3.2. Helicopter procedures if tanker does not show at ARCP or downtrack.
        8.10.1.3.3. Tanker procedures if helicopter does not show at ARCP or downtrack.
        8.10.1.3.4. Abort point and procedures to follow after that point.
        8.10.1.3.5. Alternate ARIP, ARCP, and ARCTs.
        8.10.1.3.6. Alternate track if weather becomes a factor.
  8.10.2. Rendezvous and Join-up Procedures:
     8.10.2.1. Use all available aids to assist in acquiring the receivers. Entering the refueling area,
     the tankers will be at or above refueling altitude until the position of the receivers is positively
     known. Maneuver as required to reach a position in-trail with the receivers at refueling altitude.
     8.10.2.2. Prior to rendezvous with the tanker, the lead receiver will turn on its top anti-collision
     light to allow the tanker to complete the join-up. The last helicopter in the flight will keep its top
     anti-collision light on throughout the helicopter air refueling. During operational missions, IR
     anti-collision lights may be used; however, for training in an ATC environment, normal red and
     white lights will be used.
        8.10.2.2.1. In most cases, the tanker will pass to the right of the formation at helicopter air
        refueling altitude and assume formation lead.
        8.10.2.2.2. In all cases, the receiver flights will configure elements, take spacing, climb and
        set up external lights prior to the ARIP.
        8.10.2.2.3. Light signals to be used between the tankers and receivers will be IAW TO
        1-1C-1-20.
     8.10.2.3. During rendezvous, the first and last receivers will have their top anti-collision lights
     ON. IR lenses are sometimes used, limiting detection range to approximately one mile, even on
     NVGs. The lead tanker will turn off its top anti-collision light at approximately 1/2 NM in trail of
     the receiver, no later than abeam. When the lead tanker is ready to refuel, it will signal the
     receiver. When all receivers have finished refueling, the helicopter flight will descend to the left
     and the spare tanker will assume a normal echelon formation.
100                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


NOTE:
During single receiver or two ship simultaneous AR, in conditions of low illumination (no moon or stars),
the LM may be unable to perform duties when the receiver is required to carry a strobe. The aircraft com-
mander will decide to proceed or cancel AR missions based on known or forecast conditions. Anytime
safety is compromised, terminate AR operations, or the simultaneous portion for two-ship operations.
         8.10.2.4. Receiver No-Shows. If the receivers are not acquired by the ARIP, the tankers will
         slow to 180 KIAS between ARIP and ARCP, and proceed down track at the helicopter air refuel-
         ing altitude (airspeed, as required) to ensure that the receivers have not passed by unobserved and
         to clear the track for the next refueling element. If, after proceeding down track to the AREP, the
         receivers have not been located, the tankers will execute the appropriate alternate plan. If the
         environment allows, the tankers may reverse track and maneuver near the ARCP for a specific
         prebriefed time prior to proceeding with the mission profile; however, alternate ARCPs should be
         planned and coordinated in advance should operational requirements preclude the receivers from
         making the original ARCT.

NOTE:
Receivers who are ahead of schedule are expected to maneuver prior to arriving at the refueling track so
as to make good their ARCT. At the ARCP, the receivers will be 1 minute early to on time and the tankers
will be on time to 1 minute late.
      8.10.3. Threats During Air Refueling. Threat calls and defensive maneuvering during air refueling
      require special consideration for both the HC/MC-130 and helicopter crews. Consideration must be
      given to power application or reduction, hose jettisoning, terrain clearances, flap retraction, helicopter
      maneuvering positions, and the use of defensive systems. The following procedures must be fol-
      lowed for safe employment of defensive system flares while conducting helicopter air refueling. The
      procedures are for use during operational or contingency missions only.
         8.10.3.1. HC/MC-130 tanker aircraft must safe the aft flare dispensers either by inserting the elec-
         tro-magnetic interface (EMI) filter pins/safety switch safety pins for or by safing the ALE-40 or
         using the inhibit switches for the ALE-47 interface unit switch, as applicable. The nose dispens-
         ers, if equipped, will remain unpinned. Both aft dispensers must be safed if planning to refuel
         from both hoses. If only one hose is to be utilized, the opposite side may be left armed.
         WARNING: Use extreme caution if a malfunction exists on the primary hose and ensure both
         dispensers are safed prior to crossing the receiver(s) over to the opposite observation position.
         8.10.3.2. Receiver(s) aircraft should keep all dispensers armed.
         8.10.3.3. IR warning receiver dispense settings do not change.
         8.10.3.4. There are no changes to current ALE-40/47 programmer settings.
         8.10.3.5. For flares to be effective, procedures between tanker and receiver(s) aircrews must be
         coordinated and briefed prior to flight. Simultaneous dispensing from both aircraft produces the
         highest decoy rates. Give consideration to a back-up refueling track if the primary is unusable.
         The following procedures will be used:
             8.10.3.5.1. Aircrew detecting missile launch will immediately dispense flares and call on the
             refueling frequency "flares, flares, flares, call sign, breadaway, breakaway, breakaway."
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            101


           8.10.3.5.2. All aircraft should immediately initiate a flare dispense and conduct breakaway
           procedures IAW T.O. 1-1C-1-20.
           8.10.3.5.3. Upon hearing "receiver clear" call(s) from the loadmaster(s), the flight engineer
           should immediately begin retracting the hose(s). Additionally, the loadmaster(s) must imme-
           diately notify the pilot when the helicopters are clear so defensive maneuvering can be initi-
           ated.
           8.10.3.5.4. Once the helicopters are clear, contunue defensive maneuvering IAW AFTTP 3-1.
           WARNING: When operating at or near minimum operating speed, any bank angle could
           result in a stall without warning.
       8.10.3.6. As always, unusual situations may dictate variation from this guidance. Use sound
       judgment and all available information.

8.11. Helicopter Air Refueling Light Signals. A mandatory radio silence environment necessitates the
use of light signals to accomplish refueling operations. Signals will be standardized between tanker and
receiver units. Light signals are listed in TO 1-1C-1-20.

Section 8C—Formation Procedures

8.12. General. This section prescribes basic formation procedures for Rescue HC/MC-130 aircraft.
They are guidelines, primarily designed to be used in VMC. Detailed VMC and IMC procedures are cov-
ered in the appropriate employment chapters by aircraft MDS. Accomplish formation in IMC in an ATC
environment IAW FAA or host nation procedures. Refer to specific employment volume when specified
in this section for particular MDS formation procedures.

NOTE:
AFI 11-2HC-130V1 does not include any formation requirements for Rescue HC/MC-130s. Formation
qualifications/operations, IAW the guidance in this volume, will be at the discretion of the OG/CC and
require prior MAJCOM approval. (EXCEPTION: The formation recovery procedures in paragraph
8.12.11. may be conducted single ship by qualified pilots without prior MAJCOM approval.)
   8.12.1. Type and Size. Formation size and type are dictated by aircraft resources available, ingress
   and egress environment, terrain, weather, route, altitude to be flown, and mission objectives. Forma-
   tions of ACC aircraft should not be greater than a three ship unless specifically required.
   8.12.2. Command and Lead. Clear lines of command must be established during formation flight.
   The overall responsibility for the safe and effective operation of the formation's mission lies with the
   airborne mission commander. The pilot of the lead aircraft (if not the airborne mission commander) is
   empowered to conduct the mission as planned including any planned alternates and immediate actions
   necessary for formation safety. The airborne mission commander has the responsibility to direct all
   other changes to the mission. (This does not prevent other formation members from suggesting a
   course of action.) When communicating to the rest of the formation as the airborne mission com-
   mander, use that call sign.
   8.12.3. Specified Times. The mission commander determines the sequence of events and mission
   times based on staff input, fuel requirements, user needs, taxi distances, briefing requirements, etc.
102                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


      8.12.4. Radio Discipline. Assume that the enemy has the capability to monitor, DF, and jam aircraft
      communications. Plan and fly missions using strict radio discipline to deny this capability and to
      ensure clear communications channels are available if an emergency occurs. Limit transmissions to
      only those essential to mission accomplishment and make them by secure means when possible. Air-
      borne mission commanders should ensure that communications procedures are thoroughly briefed
      prior to flight to include:
      8.12.5. Ground Operations:
         8.12.5.1. Check-In. Formation will check in as briefed. Alternate signals or runners may be used
         when operating comm-out.
         8.12.5.2. Taxi. Minimum taxi interval is one aircraft length.
         8.12.5.3. Engine Run-Up. When required, accomplish engine run-up in an approved run-up
         area. If run-up must be accomplished on the runway, position each aircraft to prevent damage to
         succeeding aircraft.
         8.12.5.4. Runway Positioning. If aircraft position on the runway, lead takes left side of runway.
         Subsequent aircraft alternate sides with nose to tail clearance. If the feed-on method is used, sub-
         sequent aircraft move into takeoff position as preceding aircraft start the takeoff roll.
      8.12.6. Takeoff:
         8.12.6.1. Interval. Minimum takeoff interval between aircraft is 15 seconds.
         8.12.6.2. Application of Power. To prevent damage to succeeding aircraft, do not advance
         power above flight idle until takeoff roll is started. Use a judicious and smooth application of
         power to achieve takeoff torque. If full power is required prior to brake release ensure adequate
         separation or use feed-on method. Lead will prebrief takeoff power settings.
         8.12.6.3. Night Vision Goggle Takeoffs. See specific employment chapters for procedures.
         8.12.6.4. Abort During Takeoff. If an aircraft aborts during takeoff roll, the navigator will
         immediately transmit on interplane frequency and the copilot on primary frequency (after com-
         pleting emergency procedures requiring immediate action) the formation position and the word
         "aborting" three times. For example, "Number 1 aborting, Number 1 aborting, Number 1 abort-
         ing." The aborting aircraft will clear the runway as expeditiously as safely possible. Succeeding
         aircraft will hold until the runway is clear. If takeoff run has already been started by succeeding
         aircraft, they will abort and clear the runway as well.
      8.12.7. Assembly Procedures:
         8.12.7.1. After crossing field boundary, wingmen adhere to ATC requirements and assume en
         route positions.
         8.12.7.2. Aircraft aborting during assembly will hold clear of departing traffic, maintain VMC if
         possible, notify lead, and contact the appropriate controlling agency.
         8.12.7.3. Use a common reference point for formation acceleration. If elapsed time is used, begin
         timing when lead starts takeoff roll.
      8.12.8. Rejoins. Aircraft joining a formation en route will rejoin as briefed to en route position. Oth-
      erwise, notify lead and remain at least 500 feet above or below the formation until the formation is in
      sight and clearance to rejoin is granted.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              103


   8.12.9. En route Procedures:
       8.12.9.1. At night, lead will announce unplanned airspeed changes of greater than 15 knots,
       unless briefed otherwise.
       8.12.9.2. Element lead maintains altitude by reference to the radar altimeter and terrain. Wing-
       men use a combination of the above, plus reference to lead aircraft.
       8.12.9.3. Aircraft aborting after assembly will notify lead and turn away from formation and
       rejoin at the end or proceed to a suitable recovery field. Aircraft within flight will reposition as
       briefed.
       8.12.9.4. Procedures for specific formation employments (airdrop, helo AR, airland, etc.) are con-
       tained in each specific employment manual.
       8.12.9.5. During inadvertent weather penetration, e.g. if clouds or areas of reduced visibility dur-
       ing VFR formation are encountered inadvertently, the primary concern of flight lead is to extricate
       the formation from the weather by providing safe aircraft separation and terrain clearance. Spe-
       cific procedures are contained in the individual employment chapters and will be thoroughly
       briefed.
       WARNING: It may be necessary to modify these procedures due to formation geometries, ter-
       rain, airspace restrictions, etc. Inadvertent weather penetration in mountainous terrain may be
       extremely hazardous. Mission planners devise and brief procedures that best suit the situation.

NOTE:
Inadvertent weather penetration procedures are for emergency use and do not constitute authority to vio-
late AFI 11-202V3 or Federal Aviation Regulations. Exercising these procedures under actual weather
conditions is a violation subject to appropriate action by the Air Force and Federal Aviation Administra-
tion (FAA). Individual aircraft should maintain VFR if there is sufficient warning to take evasive action.
Flight leads will take all practical measures to avoid entering controlled airspace without clearance.
   8.12.10. Lead Change. To accomplish a visual lead change, the leader will signal or command the
   lead change if not at a prebriefed point. The aircraft relinquishing the lead will maneuver in the safest
   direction to assume the new position.
   8.12.11. Recovery. The mission commander determines the type of recovery flown. Following are
   two methods for expeditiously recovering a formation. Other types may be necessary and should be
   thoroughly briefed. Attain traffic pattern altitude and airspeed prior to arriving at the recovery air-
   field. Brief final approach speed for each recovery if other than 140 KIAS.
       8.12.11.1. Overhead Recovery:
           8.12.11.1.1. Establish the initial approach on the runway extended centerline and fly the entry
           at 1,500 feet above field elevation or as cleared by tower, normally at 200 KIAS. Wingmen fly
           the same groundtrack as lead and stack up slightly to avoid wake turbulence.
           8.12.11.1.2. Break as the tactical situation permits (wingmen should break no earlier than
           lead's point) with a 45 degree angle of bank and retard the power to flight idle after the bank is
           established (4 seconds between breaks may be used as a guide). Make a level turn to the
           downwind leg with power reapplied as necessary to maintain 150 KIAS. Delay configuration

             until established on downwind. Wingmen follow the same altitude and downwind track as
             lead.
             8.12.11.1.3. Initiate a continuous turn to final to establish a 20-second landing interval and
             complete the before landing checklist. (initiating turn to final approximately 12-14 seconds
             apart will generally result in 20-second spacing at landing. This only applies if all aircraft
             break from initial over the same point.) Roll out on final at no less than 300 feet and 1/4 NM
             from the end of the runway. Airspeed during the turn to final will be 140 KIAS or final
             approach speed, whichever is higher. Slow to final approach speed when establish on final.
         8.12.11.2. Downwind Recovery:
             8.12.11.2.1. Enter a downwind leg for the active runway, normally maintaining 200 KIAS and
             1,000 feet above field elevation or traffic pattern altitude, whichever is higher. Formation
             wingmen fly the same groundtrack as the element leader and stack up slightly to avoid wake
             turbulence. Position the downwind to allow for a continuous turn to final.
             8.12.11.2.2. Lead will break approximately 1/2 NM past the end of the runway with a 45-
             degree angle of bank. Retard power to flight idle after the bank is established. Succeeding air-
             craft break with sufficient spacing to provide a 20-second landing interval. (At 200 KIAS
             entry speed, initiating a break approximately 10-12 seconds apart will generally result in
             20-second spacing at landing.) Complete the before landing checklist as airspeed permits.
             Make a level turn until reaching 140 KIAS or final approach speed, whichever is higher, then
             descend at this airspeed while completing the turn. Slow to final approach speed when estab-
             lished on final. Roll out on final at no less than 300 feet and 1/4 mile from the runway.

8.13. Landings. Land on runway centerline using 50% flaps, placing throttles in ground idle and reverse
as briefed. Clear the runway without slowing down or stopping in any position that would prevent suc-
ceeding aircraft from clearing the runway. The desired landing interval is 20 seconds, minimum landing
interval is 15 seconds, but consider extending this interval for strong crosswinds, narrow/short runways,
or other adverse conditions.

NOTE:
Touch-and-go landings out of formation recoveries are prohibited. Touch and Go landings are permitted
if the recovery procedures are flown single-ship.

8.14. Visual Geometries. The most survivable formation geometry will depend on the tactical situation.
This may require transition from one geometry to another as the terrain or threat changes.
      8.14.1. Mutual Support. The flight lead is primarily responsible for clearing the flight's 12 o'clock.
      Lead's secondary priorities are the right and left quadrants toward the wingmen. The wingmen look-
      out priorities will change depending on their position. The wingman to the right of lead is primarily
      responsible for the left quadrant toward and beyond the flight. The secondary responsibility is the
      right quadrant away from the flight and tertiary responsibility is the front quadrant. The left wingman
      has the symmetrically opposite responsibilities. Wingmen should strive to avoid being on the same
      side of lead since this degrades visual coverage. Mission commanders identify which aircraft are pri-
      marily responsible for lookout to the flight's 6 o'clock.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                               105


   8.14.2. In-Trail. The visual in-trail formation is a tactic designed primarily for mass airborne
   assaults operations to large drop zones. It is useful for massing a large number of aircraft over an
   objective or flying to a split-up point to minimize impact on airspace. It also permits a rapid transition
   to other geometries, including radar trail. In-trail geometry during the drop aids the user's crossload-
   ing plan and puts the formation in a narrow corridor for joint suppression of enemy air defenses
   (J-SEAD). The VFR in-trail formation normally contains up to three aircraft with an interval of
   approximately 2,000 feet between element aircraft and approximately 12,000 feet between element
   leaders. The tactical situation may dictate closer spacing to shorten total exposure time. All aircraft
   maintain the same altitude, and element wingmen maintain wing-tip overlap but out of wake turbu-
   lence to the right and left respectively.
   8.14.3. Fluid Trail. This tactic allows wingmen to optimize terrain masking, provides freedom for
   evasive maneuvers, and breaks up the symmetrical visual pattern of the in-trail formation. Wingmen
   maneuver in a designated area up to 90 degrees on either side of the in-trail position. Spacing between
   aircraft is dependent upon mission requirements, terrain, and number of aircraft, and will be briefed.
   8.14.4. Line Abreast. This formation geometry is useful over areas that provide minimal terrain
   masking, such as a desert area or a coastal penetration from over water and in situations where aircraft
   are flying to laterally-spaced initial points (IP). It is also useful where a large valley or line of com-
   munications must be crossed since the formation will be exposed for a shorter time. Planning turn
   points at the entry and exit of the line abreast leg allows for easy transition to and from trail. Line
   abreast is ideally flown in a single, two-ship element. The wingman can fly abeam lead with briefed
   lateral spacing. Line abreast for multiple legs allows little flexibility during turns for fighter evasion.
   See AFTTP 3-1V3 (S) for other turning methods.
   8.14.5. Individual Ingress. This tactic degrades the ground threat by varying the flight track each
   aircraft or element flies within a formation. It is particularly useful in avoiding detection, confusing
   or saturating enemy command and control (C2), and delaying enemy identification of mission objec-
   tives. Each aircraft or element flies a separate route to a rendezvous point for possible rejoin and a
   common run across the DZ or to individual IPs for random DZ run-ins, or flies a common route to a
   break-up point for individual random run-ins.
       8.14.5.1. In multi-ship, multi-direction run-ins, timing is critical to avoid conflict with other air-
       craft or elements. Although radar is useful to track aircraft during multiple run-ins from different
       IPs or during rejoins at a single IP, threat systems may detect radar transmissions. Consider leav-
       ing the radar in standby until a predetermined point or time, turning it on briefly for aircraft acqui-
       sition.

NOTE:
MDS specifics to these formation geometries are contained in the individual chapters of the instruction.

8.15. Dissimilar Formations. Deployment operations may require different MDS ACC aircraft to fly
together in formation. The ACC standard is the 2,000 foot visual trail. If flight in visual conditions is not
possible, use prebriefed IMC procedures to provide separation between aircraft. The lead aircraft will
direct wingmen to assume IMC spacing well prior to the formation entering the weather.

                                       FLYING TRAINING POLICY

9.1. General. This chapter supplements procedures, requirements, and restrictions for training and eval-
uation missions. See AFI 11-202, Volumes 1 and 2; and AFI 11-2HC-130, Volumes 1 and 2.

9.2. Instructor or Flight Examiner Briefings. Before all training and evaluation missions, instructors
or flight examiners brief their crew on the mission profile, training requirements, and objectives or evalu-
ation requirements.

9.3. Debriefing. After all training flights, instructors will:
      9.3.1. Review and critique student performance.
      9.3.2. Review training requirements fulfilled for each student and aircrew member (all aircrew mem-
      bers should understand thoroughly what training was accomplished).
      9.3.3. Answer technical questions.
      9.3.4. Preview the objectives of the next mission.
      9.3.5. Complete training paperwork.

9.4. Simulated Emergency Flight Procedures:
      9.4.1. Practice emergencies which require simulating an engine shutdown, or placing switches in
      other than their normal positions or an abnormal configuration, only during training, evaluation, or
      currency flights when an instructor or flight examiner pilot is in one of the pilot seats. Instructor pilot
      candidates who occupy a pilot seat and are under the supervision of a flight examiner pilot, not in a
      pilot seat, may practice simulated emergency procedures during initial or requalification upgrade
      evaluations to instructor pilot. Preface all simulated emergencies with the word "simulated" and ter-
      minate simulated emergencies when an actual emergency arises.
      9.4.2. When conducting simulated engine(s) out training, the flight engineer will post actual charted
      minimum control speeds on the TOLD card. For charted one-engine out minimum control speed
      above 109 knots, calculate a new minimum control speed by adding 8 knots during simulated
      one-engine out training. For a charted 2-engine out minimum control speed that falls between 117 and
      128, calculate a new minimum control speed by adding 8 knots during simulated 2-engine out train-
      ing. During simulated 3-engine takeoff operations, takeoff speed will be adjusted for minimum con-
      trol speed. If the charted minimum control speed is above 109 knots, add the 8 knot correction factor.
      The instructor pilot should strive to maintain a small amount of positive torque on the simulated shut-
      down engine(s).
      9.4.3. The following guidance will be adhered to during all engine(s) out training on ACC Rescue
      HC/MC-130 aircraft:
         9.4.3.1. Normally turns should be planned to be in the direction of the good engines.
         9.4.3.2. Turns into simulated failed engines should be minimized. Turns into simulated failed
         engines are permissible but require a higher degree of pilot skill than with actual failed engines
         and must be smooth and coordinated.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                   107


     WARNING: Improper application of rudder or power can lead to an immediate out-of-control
     situation where recovery might not be possible.
  9.4.4. Conduct simulated emergency flight procedures IAW AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 5; and the train-
  ing maneuver restrictions for specific flight maneuvers and missions listed in AFI 11-2HC-130V1,
  Attachment 4, Training Restrictions.

  10.2.5. (Added-920RQW) Standard Configuration.
     10.2.5.1. (Added-920RQW) Hostile Environment Repair and Tool Kit.
         10.2.5.1.1. (Added-920RQW) These kits will be marked for identification purposes and
         locked using a 4-digit numerical combination type lock. Each kit will be properly inventoried
         prior to installation by the designated flight engineer configurations noncommissioned officer
         (NCO). These kits are comprised of two sections, the hostile environment repair kit (HERK)
         and the Flight Engineer’s Tool Kit. The kits are stored on the aircraft, just behind the right
         paratroop door. If either kit is used, a complete inventory will be accomplished prior to leaving
         the work area.
         10.2.5.1.2. (Added-920RQW) The HERK and procedures are intended for use in hostile/aus-
         tere locations where maintenance support is not available. Approval authority for the use of
         HERK resides in Air Force Special Operations Command Manual (AFSOCM) 11-201, Hostile
         Environment Repair Procedures. Each kit will be accompanied by an alternating current (AC)
         generator pad and direct current (DC) power cord. These items will be verified in place during
         the flight engineer's aircraft preflight. Hostile repair procedures are covered in AFSOCM
         11-201.

             the aircraft for program depot maintenance (PDM), etc. After completing the engine shutdown
             checklist, unplug the inverter from the co-pilot’s twist-lock plug. NOTE: As a minimum, mis-
             sion-planning backpacks will contain GPS receiver, laptop, laptop power adapter, and a func-
             tional data transfer module (DTM) cartridge with the local reference library installed.
         10.2.5.3. (Added-920RQW) Loadmaster Equipment. Loadmasters will prepare, load, and down-
         load training aids. All training aids not used will be removed by the loadmaster and returned to
         loadmaster storage. Training aids that are airdropped will be returned by the drop zone controller
         (DZC) to the same facility.
             10.2.5.3.1. (Added-920RQW) Packing Material will never be dumped at sea, in accordance
             with (IAW) International Maritime Law. Retain all packing and containers not required for the
             deployment of pyrotechnics or sea dye markers for disposal upon mission termination.
             10.2.5.3.2. (Added-920RQW) Use of Chemlights during night airdrops. Attach chemlights
             with 80-lb. cotton webbing to all airdrops at night. Simulated airdrop training bundles (SATB)
             require two chemlights for each bundle.
             10.2.5.3.3. (Added-920RQW) Meal Ready to Eat (MRE). Pre-positioned MREs, located in
             the rescue bins, are used for actual search air rescue (SAR) airdrop and not for individual con-
             sumption.
      10.2.6. (Added-920RQW) Communications Security (COMSEC) Procedures. The ACS will obtain
      and safeguard all required classified documents and COMSEC material. Required COMSEC material
      will be as per training and mission requirements. If the ACS is not available or not required for the
      flight, the copilot is responsible for handling, controlling and safeguarding COMSEC material
      required for flight. The copilot will sign a hand receipt for the COMSEC package from the ACS. Air-
      crew must have COMSEC user training to receive COMSEC material.
      10.2.7. (Added-920RQW) Life Support Equipment. Aircrew will test their night vision goggles
      (NVG) prior to flight IAW Life Support procedures. Aircraft returning after normal duty hours will
      leave the NVGs in the locked container onboard the aircraft.
      10.2.8. (Added-920RQW) Aircrew Arming and Handling of Weapons. The loadmaster and flight
      engineer, will arm for all missions outside the contiguous United States (CONUS) or as directed by
      the squadron commander. Load M-9 pistol with 15 rounds of ammunition for anti-hijack purposes.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                           111


     10.2.8.1. (Added-920RQW) Aircrew members must ensure they have the following items when
     receiving weapons from 920 MXS/LGMW (Armory):
         10.2.8.1.1. (Added-920RQW) Flight Authorization
         10.2.8.1.2. (Added-920RQW) Air Force (AF) Information Management Tool (IMT) 522,
         USAF Ground Weapons Training Data or AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear
         Firearms
         10.2.8.1.3. (Added-920RQW) Correct size/type of holster or survival vest
     10.2.8.2. (Added-920RQW) Turn-in aircrew weapons to 920 MSX/LGMW (Armory) upon
     return to home station. Coordinate turn-in of weapons with 920 MXS/MOC (Defense Switched
     Network (DSN) 854-2261). At no time will personal vehicles be used to transport firearms. Use
     government vehicles to and from the armory.
  10.2.9. (Added-920RQW) Lightning Warning. Cape Weather issues two lightning warnings for
  Patrick AFB. Phase I means that conditions are favorable for lighting within 5 NMs of Patrick AFB,
  within 30 minutes. Phase I does not restrict any ground or flight operations. Phase II means lightning
  is occurring or imminent within 5 NM of Patrick AFB or Melbourne International. Phase II restricts
  personnel from continuing flight line ground operations. Phase II does not restrict aircraft taxiing to
  and from parking. No maintenance personnel are available to marshal the aircraft into parking; there-
  fore the aircraft commander will ensure proper taxi clearances are met. Normally, no aircrew member
  will be deplaned to marshal the aircraft into parking during Phase II warnings.
  10.2.10. (Added-920RQW) Functional Check Flights (FCF). Perform FCFs from 5 to 30 distance
  measuring equipment (DME) between the Patrick Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) (COF) 095
  degree and 155 degree radials.
     10.2.10.1. (Added-920RQW) Pilots and flight engineers will complete a training folder prior to
     certification. Navigators, loadmasters and ACSs will fly an FCF with an instructor prior to certifi-
     cation.
     10.2.10.2. (Added-920RQW) Two flight engineers should be scheduled on all FCFs to facilitate
     FCF checklists. Only one flight engineer needs to be FCF qualified.
     10.2.10.3. (Added-920RQW) FCF qualified pilots may perform duties from either seat.
  10.2.11. (Added-920RQW) Space Operations Procedures. All crewmembers participating in King 1
  or 2 operations during shuttle launches and Mode VIII operations will attend an aircrew and Depart-
  ment of Defense Military Support (DDMS) briefing unless arrangements are made with the aircraft
  commander. Crews should plan on preflighting, loading and sealing the aircraft the day prior to
  launch. Crews will receive at least the minimum crew rest prior to a launch and show with an entire
  crew duty day for this mission. Once an aircraft is sealed, the operations supervisor or alert crewmem-
  ber approval is needed to break the seal; once broken the aircraft will be continuously monitored by
  any squadron aircrew member. Failure to follow these procedures requires the dash 1 preflight be
  reaccomplished. NVGs and shot records will be carried on all King 1 or 2 mission.
  10.2.12. (Added-920RQW) Aircraft Preflight. Crewmembers required to performed preflight will be
  given 12 hours of crew rest prior to assuming preflight duties. Preflight duty will not exceed a 12 hour
  shift from initial report time. Crewmembers should not be tasked to begin a preflight within 1.5 hours
  to the end of their shift.

         10.2.12.1. (Added-920RQW) Duty not involving flying (DNIF) or non-current crewmembers
         will not preflight aircraft.
         10.2.12.2. (Added-920RQW) Preflight the air refueling system for every mission. This meets the
         need for short notice/airborne tasking. Preflight the flare launcher system for every off-station and
         local training mission requiring its use.
      10.2.13. (Added-920RQW) Filing Flight Plans.
         10.2.13.1. (Added-920RQW) Local visual flight rules (VFR) flight plans may be filed with base
         operations via telephone (DSN 854-2222) and all instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plans must be
         filed via facsimile (FAX) (DSN 854-6442). The aircraft commander or designated representative
         will confirm the flight plan has been received. The filing procedures are as follows:
         10.2.13.2. (Added-920RQW) Obtain local area weather (flimsy) from the 45th Weather Squadron
         homepage (click on the Local Area Flying Forecast link). Contact the forecaster (DSN 853-8488)
         for updates, initials or to request a Faxed copy of a Department of Defense (DD) Form 175-1,
         Flight Weather Briefing, (scheduling FAX DSN 854-3214).
         10.2.13.3. (Added-920RQW) To telephonically file a local VFR flight plan, contact base opera-
         tions and provide the required information from the DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan. Obtain
         the base operations representative initials and annotate the notice to airman (NOTAM) block of
         the form.
      10.2.14. (Added-920RQW) Changes to the Flight Authorization. All write-in changes to the flight
      authorization must be initialed by an individual authorized to sign flight authorization prior to the air-
      crew stepping to the aircraft. Only the squadron commander can authorize flights without a navigator
      or radio operator. The aircraft commander has the authority to release individual crewmembers from a
      flight down to a basic crew compliment.
      10.2.15. (Added-920RQW) Flight Following. Aircraft commanders will ensure the operations duty
      controller (ODC) is informed of the mission profile and aircraft location during the flight. Leave a
      copy of the flight authorization, operational risk management (ORM), flight plan and any other perti-
      nent documentation at the operations desk before proceeding to the aircraft.
         10.2.15.1. (Added-920RQW) Mission Identifiers. Open the MI, report takeoff time, report land-
         ing time, and close the MI with 920 RQW/CP (M-F/1200z to 2100z) or AFRC/CP (when 920
         RQW/CP is closed). Aircrew should use the operations supervisor/ODC to facilitate the process.
         The aircraft commander is responsible for ensuring the radio operator opens the MI with AFRC/
         DOCC a minimum of one hour prior to scheduled departure. Any change in the estimated time of
         departure (ETD) of more than 1 hour will be reported to AFRC/DOCC. The aircraft commander is
         responsible to close the MI with AFRC/DOCC within one hour of return to home station.
      10.2.16. (Added-920RQW) Aircraft Lighting. IAW AFI 11-202 V3/AFSOC Supplement, General
      Flight Rules, AFI 11-218/AFSOC Supplement, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground,
      and AFI 11-2HC-130V3, the aircraft position and strobe lights will be as follows during aircraft oper-
      ations:
         10.2.16.1. (Added-920RQW) Position Lights. These will be set to “flash” while on the ground
         and “steady” during flight.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                          113


     10.2.16.2. (Added-920RQW) Anti-Collision/Strobe Lights. All 39 RQS aircraft are equipped
     with strobe lights rather than a rotating beacon. Use of the strobe inhibit switch is applicable.
     10.2.16.3. (Added-920RQW) For none NVG/covert operations, use the following guidance:
         10.2.16.3.1. (Added-920RQW) BEFORE STARTING ENGINES checklist. Position lights
         will be set to FLASH, strobe lights to RED/WHITE (whichever is applicable), strobe inhibit
         switch to ANTI-COLLISION.
         10.2.16.3.2. (Added-920RQW) LINEUP checklist. Position lights will be set to STEADY,
         strobe inhibit switch to OFF. This enables the strobe light operation.
         10.2.16.3.3. (Added-920RQW) AFTER LANDING checklist. The position lights will be set
         to FLASH, strobe inhibit switch will be placed to ANTI-COLLISION.
         10.2.16.3.4. (Added-920RQW) For AFSOC fixed wing aircraft, red strobe lights should be
         used at night and white strobes should be used during daylight.
  10.2.17. (Added-920RQW) Turbulence Encountered on Low Level Missions. When winds exceed 25
  knots across a ridgeline or mountaintop, there is a high potential for significant mountain wave turbu-
  lence. When this occurs, crews should avoid flying on the downwind side of ridges and peaks. Fly
  upwind or above significant terrain. Avoid terrain-masking flights, which place the aircraft in narrow
  canyons, and valleys where turbulence can be enhanced by the Venturi effect.
     10.2.17.1. (Added-920RQW) Do not fly low-level in mountainous terrain when surface winds
     exceed 40 knots (reported or observed).
     10.2.17.2. (Added-920RQW) Flight in areas of forecast severe turbulence is prohibited.
  10.2.18. (Added-920RQW) Helicopter Air Refueling (HAR) Procedures. Perform HAR on published
  air refueling (AR) tracks or within the confines of a military operating area (MOA) to the maximum
  extent possible.
     10.2.18.1. (Added-920RQW) Coordinates for Marion MOA AR track are:
         10.2.18.1.1. (Added-920RQW) North IP N27 49.44 W080 59.00
         10.2.18.1.2. (Added-920RQW) North CP N27 43.44 W080 59.00
         10.2.18.1.3. (Added-920RQW) South CP N27 20.50 W080 59.00
         10.2.18.1.4. (Added-920RQW) South IP N27 14.50 W080 59.00
     10.2.18.2. (Added-920RQW) During air refueling operations, it is necessary to switch the
     Enhanced Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (ETCAS) from the normal setting of TA/
     RA to NORM to avoid unwanted traffic collision warnings from the ETCAS when receivers are in
     close proximity to the aircraft. This should be accomplished no earlier than the Precontact Check-
     list and no later than 1 NM in trail of the receiver aircraft. The ETCAS mode selector may then be
     switched back to normal operation at the discretion of the aircraft commander following the com-
     pletion of the air refueling.
  10.2.19. (Added-920RQW) Hose Jettison. The primary jettison area is the west side of runway 02/20
  at Patrick AFB. The initial approach may be to either runway 02 or 20. If the hose fails to cut attempt
  to avoid flying over populated areas. Avoid jettison of hose over the instrument landing system (ILS)
  transmitters (red lights at night) on the west side of the approach end of runway 20.

      10.2.20. (Added-920RQW) Tactical Recoveries. All tactical recovery procedures will be flown IAW
      Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-3.33 Combat Aircraft Fundamentals and
      45th Space Wing Instruction (45 SWI) 13-203, Airfield Operations Procedures. Altitudes above 2500
      mean sea level (MSL) will be coordinated with the tower.
      10.2.21. (Added-920RQW) Pyrotechnic Training Operations. Pyrotechnic operations are permitted at
      Cavallo Drop Zone and other approved ranges. Coordinate with the US Coast Guard, command post,
      base operations, and Patrick air traffic control (ATC) services. When planning pyrotechnic operations,
      add the following to the remarks section of DD Form 175: “Pyro drops (flares/smokes) at Cavallo
      Drop Zone (COF 115/40) 20 NM radius, altitude, and time frame”.
      10.2.22. (Added-920RQW) Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC) Procedures. Use these proce-
      dures anytime a crewmember is replaced on the aircraft. Applicable items may be accomplished at the
      discretion of the aircraft commander for anything other than a full crew complement change.
         10.2.22.1. (Added-920RQW) During the mission briefing, the aircraft commander of each crew
         will ensure that all crewmembers have reviewed the engines running crew change checklist prior
         to the crew change. Coordinate the location of the ERCC with participating aircrew members,
         King Operations, and MOCC. Brief the location of the ERCC during the mission briefing.
         10.2.22.2. (Added-920RQW) Deplaning Crew: Ensure a sufficient number of SATBs and pyro-
         technics for both missions are delivered to the aircraft prior to initial takeoff. Also ensure the fuel
         load is sufficient for both missions. Complete the weight and balance form and take off and land
         data (TOLD) card for the enplaning crew. List all discrepancies in the Air Force Technical Order
         (AFTO) IMT 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, before the crew change.
         After the aircraft has stopped in the designated location, the aircraft commander and flight engi-
         neer will remain at their stations while the other crewmembers proceed to the cargo compartment.
         The loadmaster will open the crew entrance door or the cargo ramp and door upon the command
         of the pilot and get positioned on the interphone as required ensuring safe entrance to the aircraft.
         After the enplaning crew is aboard, the loadmaster will board the aircraft and close the door. The
         departing loadmaster will take the signed weight and balance form when departing the aircraft.
         10.2.22.3. (Added-920RQW) Enplaning Crew: Board the aircraft and go to the cargo compart-
         ment. The oncoming aircraft commander will sign the weight and balance form. The aircraft com-
         mander, copilot and engineer will go to the flight deck for the change of positions with the
         deplaning crew. When the two aircraft commanders change position they also change command of
         the aircraft at that time. The flight engineer/loadmaster will fit or stow parachute/restraint harness
         as required. All crewmembers will discuss discrepancies with counterparts. The enplaning load-
         master will open the appropriate door upon the pilot’s command and facilitate a safe off load of the
         deplaning crew.
      10.2.23. (Added-920RQW) Birdbath Procedure. Aircraft commanders should use the clear water
      rinse facility (birdbath) after every flight in which the aircraft is flown over salt water below 1000’
      AGL, excluding takeoffs and landings. If a birdbath facility is unavailable, make the following anno-
      tation in the AFTO IMT 781A, “Aircraft subjected to salt spray, birdbath unavailable.”
         10.2.23.1. (Added-920RQW) After landing, run the After Landing Operations Stop checklist
         prior to entering the birdbath.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                          115


     10.2.23.2. (Added-920RQW) Activate the birdbath by clicking the transmitter 5 times within 7
     seconds on very high frequency (VHF) 148.45. Allow approximately one minute for the pressure
     to build up. Repeated attempts will disable the birdbath.
     10.2.23.3. (Added-920RQW) As full spray begins, start taxiing slowly on centerline at a rate that
     allows adequate rinsing of the airframe. Exercise flight controls as water washes them.
     10.2.23.4. (Added-920RQW) Use the following guidance to maximize the effectiveness of the
     birdbath and ensure safe operations.
         10.2.23.4.1. (Added-920RQW) Ensure that sensors such as the radar/ forward looking infra-
         red [radar] (FLIR) are off prior to entering the birdbath.
         10.2.23.4.2. (Added-920RQW) The gas turbine compressor (GTC), air turbine motor (ATM),
         air turbine motor generator (ATM GEN), and auxiliary power unit (APU) will remain off with
         doors closed to prevent flameout and flooding of the GTC/APU compartment.
         10.2.23.4.3. (Added-920RQW) Set flaps to 100% and switch off and extended both auxiliary
         and normal landing lights.
         10.2.23.4.4. (Added-920RQW) All four engines should be at normal ground idle with the
         lowest power setting available. Two engines in normal ground idle and two in low speed
         ground idle (LSGI) may be used if aircraft weight does not restrict the forward movement
         through the birdbath.
         10.2.23.4.5. (Added-920RQW) Complete the After Landing checklist after the rinse is com-
         pleted. Run the engines at normal ground idle for a minimum of two minutes to aid in drying
         out engine nacelles.
         CAUTION: Severe damage to flight control hinges and boost packs may result if the flight
         controls are allowed to slam against their stops. Copilot/pilot should hold the yoke while tax-
         ing through the birdbath.
         CAUTION: Turbine overheat light may illuminate after entering birdbath due to water inges-
         tion in the turbine area. If condition persists perform Engine Shutdown Procedure (ESP).
  10.2.24. (Added-920RQW) Hung Ordinance Procedures. Following training involving the live firing
  of chaff/flares:
     10.2.24.1. (Added-920RQW) After final landing, taxi to arm/de-arm area and check for hung ord-
     nance.
     10.2.24.2. (Added-920RQW) If partially ejected ordnance is identified, notify the MOCC, opera-
     tions supervisor, and local base controllers to have container recovery system/electronic counter
     measure (CRS/ECM) and explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) meet the aircraft. Remain in arm/
     de-arm area until EOD personnel can clear all partially ejected ordinances.
  10.2.25. (Added-920RQW) Maintenance Debrief. Aircraft commanders will debrief at MOC as soon
  as possible after a flight. If MOC is unavailable, leave aircraft forms on the plane. FAX a copy of the
  AFTO IMT 781 to MOC at extension 8870.
  10.2.26. (Added-920RQW) Operations Debrief. After all missions, leave the flight folder with com-
  pleted individual mission accomplishment reports, mission accomplishment summary, AFTO IMT
  781 and a corrected Flight Authorization in the flight management in-box.

                                       NAVIGATOR PROCEDURES

11.1. General:
      11.1.1. Rescue HC/MC-130 Flight Operations. All ACC Rescue HC/MC-130 flight operations
      requiring a navigator will use navigation forms prescribed by this volume.
      11.1.2. Forms. This volume contains instructions for completion of (samples of several are included)
      AF Forms 4051 and 4052. Computer flight plan forms may be used in lieu of the AF Form 70, Pilot's
      Flight Plan and Flight Log; and the flight plan portion of the AF Form 4116, C-130 Flight Plan and
      Record.
      11.1.3. Record ATC clearances and monitor the readback. This includes all ATC instructions during
      departure, en route, and approach. EXCEPTION: Not required when ATC instructions require
      immediate execution by the pilot, or when such action would interfere with the timely performance of
      aircrew duties.
      11.1.4. Monitor the primary command radio unless directed by the aircraft commander to do other-
      wise.
      11.1.5. Departure and Approach Monitoring. Immediately after takeoff, cross-check available
      flight instruments with the airborne radar to ensure the aircraft remains clear of obstructions. During
      departure and arrival in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) with airborne radar inoperative,
      use all available navigational aids to accurately position the aircraft. On all departures and arrivals,
      have the appropriate approach plate open to monitor course, timing, and altitude. Backup the pilots
      and assist as necessary. Report any deviations immediately. Assist in clearing for other aircraft when
      possible. Confine activities to these critical duties during all departures and arrivals.
      11.1.6. Flight Following. On flights along airways or Category II routes, use applicable plotting
      charts suitable for radar flight following (JNCA scale or larger). Use a chummed terrain chart (ONC
      scale or larger) depicting all terrain in the departure/arrival terminal area (within 25NM of the air-
      field).

11.2. General Flight Planning Procedures:
      11.2.1. Regardless of whether a flight plan is prepared by the aircrew or is furnished by another
      agency, the aircraft commander and navigator will verify routes and altitudes to ensure proper terrain
      clearance. On overseas flights, verify the flight planned routing against the diplomatic clearance, if
      applicable. Ensure all required fuel computations are accurate and complete, and confirm the ramp
      fuel load is compatible with mission requirements.
      11.2.2. Category I Routes. Accomplish flight planning using the AF Form 4116, C-130 Navigation
      Log, or a computer flight plan (CFP). Compute the required fuel load using the AF Form 4052, Air
      Refueling Worksheet; AF Form 4119, Fuel Planning Worksheet.
      11.2.3. Category II Routes. Use the AF Form 70; AF Form 4116, C-130 Navigation Log; or a CFP.
      Compute required fuel using the CFP.
      11.2.4. Provide a copy of the flight plan to the pilot, radio operator, and any crewmember requesting
      it.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            117


11.3. Computer Flight Planning. As with any computer generated mission planning product, the air-
crew is always responsible for accuracy of data used in-flight. All computer generated flight plans will be
verified for correctness prior to each flight. Untested or BETA versions of developing software will not
be used for actual mission planning.

NOTE:
The primary flight/mission planning system is the Air Force Flight Management System (AFFMS). This
includes the Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS/CFPS). Upgraded or new versions of PFPS/CFPS
will be released and authorized by the MAJCOM/DO for use after applicable testing has been completed
(OPR: MAJCOM/DOT).
   11.3.1. Creating Flight Logs. In addition to manual flight logs (AF Form 4116, C-130 Navigation
   Log), computer flight planning systems including Computer Flight Planning System (CFPS), Portable
   Flight Planning System (PFPS), Falcon View are authorized to create a navigator flight log.
   11.3.2. Electronic Data Transfer. If the flight planning computer transfers a flight plan to the air-
   craft electronically, it must be an ACC approved system. MAJCOM/DOT will periodically publish a
   listing of approved systems. Aircrews will not use unapproved versions of any system to load an air-
   craft navigation computer without MAJCOM/DOT approval. Rescue HC/MC-130 aircrews are
   authorized to use the Data Transfer Module (DTM) for loading flight plan data.
   11.3.3. AMC CFPs. AMC CFPs may be available for missions which meet CFP support criteria and
   are within the capability of the system. Obtain the CFP through the command post, base weather
   facility, or base operations dispatcher. When the mission includes air refueling or requires a specific
   routing, request the CFP by message format. Make this request 48 hours in advance unless prevented
   by mission needs. If prior arrangement is made with the AMC Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC)
   duty flight planner, the LDI Portable Interactive Terminal (or equivalent) may also be used. Opti-
   mized AMC CFPs (OMFP) will be provided unless the user requests otherwise.
       11.3.3.1. If problems are encountered with AMC computer flight plans, call the AMC TACC duty
       officer.
       11.3.3.2. Computer Flight Plan Wind Bust. Attempt to relay inaccurate CFP winds to a USAF
       weather agency via high frequency (HF) phone patch or pilot to metro service (PMSV) if the aver-
       age wind for a route segment differs from the CFP wind by 30 degrees or more in direction, or 25
       knots or more in velocity.
   11.3.4. Computer Fuel Plans. Computer aided flight planning systems (that meet the criteria in
   paragraph 11.3.1.) produce flight plans and fuel calculations for C-130 and other aircraft. Computer
   Flight Plans may be used in place of the AF Form 4116, C-130 Flight Plan and Record. However,
   add alternate, identified extra, and reserve fuel in addition to the calculation. The printed format is
   user configurable and may be tailored to local needs. Section 4 covers detailed planning using these
   systems.

11.4. Fuel Planning. Accomplish fuel planning IAW the appropriate C-130 fuel planning publications in
Table 11.1. Do not include C-130E drag-factors to fuel calculations. When using -1-1 fuel planning
charts, use 100 percent engine performance. CFP en route fuel may be used for fuel analysis in lieu of en
route fuel derived from the performance T.O. or fuel planning regulation. AF Form 4116 fuel analysis
blocks may be reproduced on the computer flight plan printed format.

      11.4.1. AF Form 4116, C-130 Navigation Log Fuel Analysis. With the exception of those items
      explained in this paragraph, all items of the fuel analysis portion of the AF Form 4116 are explained
      fully in Figure 11.1.

NOTE:
To compute terminal fuel flow using 55-series fuel planning instructions, add 1 hour to the en route time
(item 1, AF Form 4116) and obtain total fuel. Subtract the en route fuel in item 1 from this total fuel to
obtain fuel flow for the last hour, which is terminal fuel flow (TFF). When an ACCI-series fuel planning
instruction is not available, use the specific range charts or the range summary charts in the applicable air-
craft performance manual.

         climb profile based on planned takeoff gross weight, and without regard to ATC requirements for
         direction of flight. For planning purposes, use "maximum continuous power" for cruise altitude
         ceiling. When passengers are carried and oxygen is not available to them, the HIGHEST ACC FL
         will not exceed FL 250. Enter the flight level to the nearest 100 feet.
         11.4.1.2. ENDURANCE. Flying time based on fuel available at takeoff (Item 11 minus Item 9).
         It is extracted from the appropriate fuel planning publication, performance manual, or AF Form
         4125 for the planned constant altitude, forecast temperature deviation, and the aircraft gross
         weight at takeoff. For AF Form 4119, use fuel flow in zone 3, section II. Do not include added
         fuel for rough paint or radome in item 1 for endurance computation.
         11.4.1.3. BURN OFF. The amount of fuel burned from engine start to shut down. It includes en
         route, approach, taxi and run-up, and identified extra fuel for that mission segment (items
         1+7+9+1000 pounds). It does not include fuel identified for subsequent mission segments or the
         6000 pounds for minimum landing fuel. Entry in this block is optional.

      11.4.2. ETP Computations. Wind Factor and ETP Data Computations are required on Category I
      routes or Category I portions of routes when the total time between the last suitable airfield (LSAF)
      and the first suitable airfield (FSAF) is 5 hours or more. Suitable airfields are those within 100 NM of
      flight planned course centerline meeting weather, fuel, and ACC C-130 runway requirements. For air
      refueling missions, make a separate computation for each fuel analysis required. The ETP should
      drive the location of your planned AR track. Plan to have sufficient fuel at each EAR point to proceed
      to an abort base if the tanker does not show. Use a point abeam the AR abort base as the LSAF or
      FSAF for wind factor computations, and enter ETP data in section III of the AF Form 4119.
         11.4.2.1. In-flight ETP. Recompute the ETP when the actual arrival over any reporting point
         prior to the ETP exceeds 15 minutes ahead or behind time when the change was caused by errone-
         ous wind information. If the change was caused by factors other than a change in the wind (i.e.,
         slow TAS or deviation for weather), simply compute a new ETA to the ETP, as the ETP itself will
         not have changed.

NOTES:

             1. Wind factor and ETP computations are not required for round-robin or search missions.
             2. Suitable runways for ACC C-130s are 5000 feet long, 60 feet wide, and must have the sin-
                gle-tandem weight-bearing capacity for planned gross weight. Consult the pilot if consid-
                ering an airfield less than 5000 feet long or 60 feet wide.
         11.4.2.2. Wind Factor Data:

NOTE:
In the following paragraphs for wind factor computation convenience, LSAF means level-off, abeam or
over LSAF, or closest planned checkpoint or radio aid within 100 NM of LSAF. FSAF means abeam or
over FSAF, closest planned checkpoint or radio aid within 100 NM of FSAF, descent point, or destination.
Use any of the options in the ETP options graph, Figure 11.2. Specify the option used in the ETP compu-
tations section of the AF Form 4116. Record computations in the ETP computations section.
             11.4.2.2.1. Total. Compute the average ground speed (GS) between LSAF and FSAF. Divide
             the total distance between the two end points by the total time between the two points:
                 Total Distance
                 Total Time = Average GS
                 Subtract average flight planned true airspeed (TAS) from average GS to obtain
                 the total wind factor.
                 WF = Average GS - Average TAS

            11.4.2.2.3. 2nd Half. Compute the average GS between the approximate midpoint and the
            FSAF. Subtract flight planned TAS from the computed average GS to obtain the 2nd half wind
            factor.
         11.4.2.3. ETP Data:
            11.4.2.3.1. DISTANCE (LSAF TO FSAF). Enter the total distance (regardless of level off)
            from or abeam the LSAF along course from departure to or abeam the FSAF along course
            toward destination.
            11.4.2.3.2. T( )MIN. The flight time from the ETP to the FSAF or return to the LSAF.
            11.4.2.3.3. TOTAL TIME TO FSAF - T = TIME TO ETP. Subtract the time, T( )MIN,
            from the total flight plan time to the FSAF. TIME TO ETP is the total time from departure to
            the ETP (departure and takeoff may not necessarily be the same). Compute and record ETA to
            ETP by adding TIME TO ETP to departure time.

         required to make destination (block 25) and planned fuel onload from the tanker (block 26).
         11.4.3.4.6. UNIDENTIFIED EXTRA. Subtract fuel required prior to onload (block 28)
         from the projected fuel at end air refueling (block 27). This equals extra fuel or additional
         required (if negative). Additional fuel must be available from the tanker or added to ramp fuel.
  11.4.4. AF Form 4119, C-130 Fuel Planning Worksheet. Complete this form whenever the mis-
  sion profile is incompatible with ACCI-series fuel planning instructions or computer flight plans.

NOTE:
There is no separate zone for descent to rendezvous or low level altitude. Descent is assumed to occur at
the end of zone 5 with the same fuel flow as zone 5.
              11.4.4.2.1.4. Zone 6, EAR/LLXP. End air refueling or low level exit point (cross out the
              one not applicable). Use this zone for the rendezvous or air refueling leg or for the low
              level portion of a high/low or high/low/high profile. Leave blank if the leg ends at destina-
              tion. For low level, estimate fuel flow at 6000 pounds per hour for Rescue HC/MC-130.
              11.4.4.2.1.5. Zone 7, TERM (Terminal). Alternate IAF for legs ending at destination, or
              AR abort base IAF for legs ending at destination or AR abort base. Enter the proper name
              or ICAO identifier of the alternate or abort airfield in the ZONE column. Leave blank

           11.4.4.2.2. START ZONE G.W./ZONE FUEL. Enter the takeoff gross weight from the AF
           Form 4116 for the first zone. For each zone, subtract the zone fuel to obtain the start zone
           gross weight for the next zone.
           11.4.4.2.3. ONLOAD. When an air refueling is planned, add the planned tanker onload to the
           zone 7 start zone gross weight to get the start zone gross weight for the next zone 1. Leave
           blank if the leg ends at destination.
           11.4.4.2.4. ALT/T.DEV. Enter the pressure altitude and forecast temperature deviation for
           the zone. Use the planned rendezvous altitude for zone 6 when air refueling. Estimate the
           average altitude for zone 6 when low level.
           11.4.4.2.5. TAS. Zone true airspeed. Same as the TAS column entry on the AF Form 4116.
           Make a separate entry for each zone if using long range cruise performance data.
           11.4.4.2.6. END TIME-START TIME/ZONE TIME. Enter the corresponding flight plan
           total times for the end point and start point of the zone. Subtract to obtain zone time. Total
           time entries may be omitted for zones containing only one flight plan line (e.g., zones 1, 6, and
           7).
           11.4.4.2.7. BURN PER ENG/VAR CONF. If using performance manual data, enter the base
           fuel flow and the fuel flow corrected for variant configuration (per hour per engine). Leave
           blank for zone 1.
           11.4.4.2.8. FUEL FLOW PER HOUR. If a VAR CONF entry was made in the previous col-
           umn, multiply by four to get hourly fuel flow. Leave blank for zone 1.
           11.4.4.2.9. ZONE FUEL/EN ROUTE FUEL. Enter section 1 corrected climb fuel in the
           zone 1 EN ROUTE FUEL block for climb after departure or air refueling. Enter climb fuel in
           the zone 1 ZONE FUEL block for climb after low level. Enter fuel based on fuel flow per hour
           and zone time in the ZONE FUEL block for other zones. Add ZONE FUEL to the previous
           EN ROUTE FUEL value to obtain the new EN ROUTE FUEL entry.
           11.4.4.2.10. DISTANCE. Enter the total flight plan distance corresponding to the end of the
           zone.
       11.4.4.3. Section III B, AIR REFUELING FUEL ANALYSIS. The AF Form 4116 Fuel Anal-
       ysis block is always used for the leg beginning with departure. For air refueling missions, com-

     plete an AF Form 4119, section III, Fuel Analysis for each leg from EAR to the next EAR or
     destination IAF. Use additional copies of the AF Form 4119 if necessary. All entries in section III
     are completed in the same manner as the fuel analysis block on the AF Form 4116 except:
         11.4.4.3.1. FROM/TO. Enter start and end points for the leg. Examples: FROM EAR1 TO
         EAR2 or FROM EAR2 TO KHRT.
         11.4.4.3.2. Item 8, REQUIRED EAR. Total of items 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
         11.4.4.3.3. Items 9 and 10. Not included on this form.
         11.4.4.3.4. Item 11, PLANNED EAR. Planned EAR = Onload + previous 2, 12, and 13. If
         the result is less than item 8, plan to increase the planned onload or alter the AR track location.
         11.4.4.3.5. ETP Calculations Section. The ETP 1 block corresponds to the AF Form 4116
         Fuel Analysis. The ETP 2 and 3 blocks correspond to the AF Form 4119, section III, Air
         Refueling Fuel Analysis. LSAF/FSAF TDIST and TOTAL TIME TO FSAF are used to calcu-
         late the DIST (LSAF to FSAF) and TIME TO ETP entries on the fuel analysis and are not
         required if the LSAF or FSAF is on or abeam a point in the TO column of AF Form 4116. The
         DIST and TIME blocks are used to calculate the average GS to determine the TOTAL, FIRST
         HALF, and SECOND HALF wind factors.
     11.4.4.4. Section II Data for AF Form 4125. Complete these entries and use in place of the AF
     Form 4125, Chart Construction Data block.
         11.4.4.4.1. EN ROUTE AND DESTINATION FUEL. For each fuel analysis, add item 1
         (EN ROUTE FUEL) and item 13 (REQUIRED OVR DEST/ABORT BASE). Taken from the
         AF Form 4125 for the Fuel Analysis 1 block and from the AF Form 4119 for the Fuel Analysis
         2 and 3 blocks.
         11.4.4.4.2. MINIMUM FUEL. EN ROUTE and DESTINATION FUEL minus EN ROUTE
         FUEL. To check this computation, zone 6 (MINIMUM FUEL) should equal item 13 on the
         corresponding fuel analysis. Plot MINIMUM FUEL vs. DISTANCE entries on AF Form
         4125.
  11.4.5. In-flight Fuel Management. Required for each flight over a Category I route when the flight
  time between LSAF and FSAF airfields is 5 hours or more. Use AF Forms 4052, 4125, or the in-flight
  fuel management section on the AF Form 4116.
  11.4.6. In-flight Procedures, AF Form 4052. The reverse side of the AF Form 4052 may be used
  for in-flight fuel management. All entries on the form are self-explanatory except for the following:
     11.4.6.1. Top Section, Beginning with RETA TO END A/R:
         11.4.6.1.1. FUEL BEFORE OFFLOAD (28). Fuel required at EAR minus the planned
         onload from the tanker. Fuel required at EAR is the sum of the fuel required for en route (EAR
         to destination), reserve (10 percent of the en route fuel from EAR to destination), alternate,
         holding, approach and landing, and identified extra.
         11.4.6.1.2. A/R ADJUST (3). Additional fuel for time on the refueling track, computed at
         1000 pounds per hour.
         11.4.6.1.3. ETE TO END A/R. RETA to EAR minus the current time.

         11.4.6.2. Middle Section, Beginning with RETA TO ABORT BASE. This section need not be
         completed if item 17 on the front of the form exceeds 4000 pounds.
             11.4.6.2.1. FUEL O/H ABORT BASE (18). The sum of the fuel required for the abort alter-
             nate, holding, and approach and landing.
             11.4.6.2.2. A/R ADJUST (3). Additional fuel for time on the refueling track, computed at
             1000 pounds per hour.
         11.4.6.3. Bottom Section, Beginning with RETA TO DESTINATION. All entries are
         self-explanatory except FUEL REQ O/H DEST (30). This is the sum of the fuel required for alter-
         nate, holding, and approach and landing.
      11.4.7. AF Form 4116, In-flight Fuel Management. In-flight fuel management, using the AF Form
      4116 In-flight Fuel Management section, may be accomplished using the constant altitude pages in the
      fuel planning instructions or using actual in-flight engine burn rates. Use of AMCP-series (as appli-
      cable) fuel planning procedures will create a small but acceptable error, as the fuel charts include fuel
      for climb to altitude. This error will build slightly more fuel than is actually required into the compu-
      tation. This inaccuracy is acceptable because use of the charts simplifies preflight fuel planning and
      provides a flexible system of in-flight fuel management. Using the actual in-flight burn rate method
      will produce acceptable error in that projected current four engine burn rates will lower as gross
      weight decreases and power is reduced to maintain a constant TAS. Block entries are as follows:
         11.4.7.1. RETA DEST. Revised ETA at destination/EAR.
         11.4.7.2. TIME. Record the departure time, level off time, and regular time intervals not to
         exceed one hour.
         EXCEPTION: The time interval between the level off entry and the next entry may be up to
         1+30.
         11.4.7.3. GROSS WEIGHT. Aircraft gross weight at the time of the fuel reading.
         11.4.7.4. PAGE/BURN RT. Appropriate page in ACCI-series fuel planning regulation or the
         current four engine burn rate. When using ACCI-series fuel planning instructions, use the con-
         stant altitude page based on current altitude and true airspeed.
         11.4.7.5. FUEL REM. Total fuel remaining at time of reading minus restrictions for rough paint
         and radome, if applicable.

NOTE:
Any identified extra fuel is included in fuel remaining or extra time.
         11.4.7.6. O/H FUEL. Alternate and missed approach fuel, plus holding fuel, approach and land-
         ing fuel (block 13 on the front of the AF Form 4116), and stored fuel for helicopter offload. If AR
         is required, O/H Fuel is the sum of the AR abort base overhead fuel and the en route fuel from
         EAR to the abort base.
         11.4.7.7. DIFF. Subtract O/H FUEL from FUEL REM to find remaining useable fuel (DIFF).
         11.4.7.8. FUEL ETE. DIFF converted to time. When using the ACCI-series fuel planning
         instructions, use the same procedure as for calculating preflight endurance. When using burn rate,
         divide the remaining useable fuel (DIFF) by the current hourly burn rate.

NOTE:
Prior to the ETP, if FUEL ETE is less than ETE DEST, plan to return to departure base or last suitable air-
port, or continue to first suitable airport. Evaluate carefully in order to arrive over the chosen field with
fuel required overhead destination. Consider a change in altitude which improves fuel consumption per
distance traveled (see AFI 11-2HC-130V3, Chapter 6).
       11.4.7.9. ETE DEST. Estimated time en route from position at time of fuel reading to destina-
       tion/EAR.
       11.4.7.10. EXT TIME. Subtract ETE DEST from FUEL ETE. Brief the pilot on fuel status at
       each reading.
       11.4.7.11. TEMP DEV/ALT. Temperature deviation and altitude at time of fuel reading.
       11.4.7.12. Terminate in-flight fuel management when an approach is initiated (begin descent
       point) or at the discretion of the aircraft commander.

11.5. Flight Charts. Maintain a plotting chart showing flight progress on all Category I routes. The fol-
lowing information will be shown on the chart:
   11.5.1. Navigator's name and coordinated universal date in the vicinity of departure or coast out
   point. Chart number, and chart edition will be annotated on the back of all stripped charts. For low
   level flight charts (1:500,000, 1:250,000, and 1:50,000), annotate current CHUM near the chart num-
   ber and edition. Check the CHUM on all charts (GNC, JNC, etc.). It is not required to write the
   CHUM information on high-level charts.
   11.5.2. The flight plan centerlines and portions of ADIZ and FIR boundaries pertinent to the route.
   Label reporting points with proper names or geographical coordinates. Place the applicable portion of
   the "No Fly" line on all charts used for missions flown in the vicinity of unfriendly territory. Promi-
   nently mark warning and restricted areas within 25 NM of planned course and 3000 feet of planned
   altitude on the chart (not required if a FLIP en route chart with this information is immediately avail-
   able and used). Annotate airfields along the planned route which could serve as possible emergency
   landing areas. Consider the following factors when selecting emergency airfields: type aircraft,
   weather conditions, runway length, runway weight-bearing capacity, runway lighting, radio naviga-
   tional aids, and proximity to planned flight path.
   11.5.3. Fixes or position plots and clearly designated time of each fix or position. Fixes or positions
   may be numbered and the corresponding numbers entered in the position column of the log instead of
   the geographical coordinates or descriptive position.
   11.5.4. In the interest of conservation, reuse flight charts for high level missions whenever this would
   not affect plotting accuracy of fixes or position determination.
   11.5.5. Navigators will personally maintain charts and navigator's logs as part of the flight record for
   a minimum of 90 days.

11.6. Flight Records Completion (AF Form 4116). This form will include in-flight progress and pro-
posed data; complete in sufficient detail to fully evaluate or reconstruct the flight. The section is divided
into two parts on the front side of the form (actual and proposed), with substantiation areas on the back
side of the form. These procedures are designed to accommodate a wide range of different C-130 navi-

gation equipment configurations. Units may require all entries on the actual side of the flight log to be
computed rather than spot, if deemed more appropriate for their particular configuration.
      11.6.1. AF Form 4116, C-130 Flight Plan and Record. All items in the flight plan portion are
      self-explanatory except as noted.
         11.6.1.1. ZONE OR WPT. Used to list waypoints and fuel zones.
         11.6.1.2. TO. List proper names of intersections, waypoints, or coordinates if no name is
         assigned. Include a separate flight plan line for all of the following (use an additional AF Form
         4116 if required).
             11.6.1.2.1. Initial Level Off. A separate line is not required when using ACCI-series fuel
             planning publications to determine en route fuel, but is recommended for ETP computations.
             Compute zone time for climb lines by using average climb TAS. If a line contains both climb
             and cruise, compute zone time at en route TAS plus 1 minute for each 4000 feet of climb.
             11.6.1.2.2. Level off after low level, search, or air refueling. Compute as in paragraph
             11.6.1.3.
             11.6.1.2.3. Delay for low level.
             11.6.1.2.4. Rendezvous or Air Refueling ( receiver only). From the ARIP to the EAR.
         11.6.1.3. RETA. Revised ETA. Use this column when route diversions or unexpected speed
         changes cause significant ETA changes (greater than 3 minutes).
         11.6.1.4. A OR B. Ahead or behind. List minutes ahead of (A) or behind (B) flight plan time.
         Based on original ETA. Entry optional.
         11.6.1.5. ALTERNATE. Use AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules; and AFI 11-2HC-130V3,
         Chapter 6; to determine the requirement for a destination alternate airfield. Enter the proper
         name or the ICAO identifier of the alternate airfield, if required. Enter the AR abort airfield for
         legs ending with air refueling.
             11.6.1.5.1. DISTANCE. The straight line distance or total flight planned zone distance from
             destination to alternate airfield. For air refueling, use the straight line distance or total flight
             planned zone distance from EAR to abort airfield.
             11.6.1.5.2. TIME. Compute using cruise true airspeed and best known wind.
      11.6.2. Actual Side:
         11.6.2.1. The actual side of the flight log will contain actual observations and data obtained
         in-flight to substantiate the progress and position of the aircraft. When an entry is the same as the
         entry above it, a check mark may be used to indicate "same as previous entry."
         11.6.2.2. POSITION. Enter one of the following:
             11.6.2.2.1. Position coordinates (latitude and longitude).
             11.6.2.2.2. Number or letter corresponding to the specific fix or position on the navigation
             chart.
             11.6.2.2.3. Proper name or ICAO identifier of the navigation facility (e.g., LEV VORTAC) or
             geographical point.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              129


NOTE:
A position entry may be a fix, Dead Reckoning (DR) position, air position, or Most Probable Position
(MPP).
       11.6.2.3. TC. Enter the measured true course (for position to position computations) from the
       previous position to the current logged position.
       11.6.2.4. W/V. Wind and drift block. Enter either the computed average wind (fix to fix) based
       on the data entered on the actual side, or an average wind at the position from reliable Doppler,
       Inertial Navigation System (INS), Self-Contained Navigation System (SCNS), or Global Position-
       ing System (GPS). Use either computed or computer derived average drift correction.
       11.6.2.5. TH. Enter the average true heading (computed from average compass heading or TH)
       from last fix or air position to current air position.
       11.6.2.6. TAS. Enter the average true airspeed since the previously logged position.
       11.6.2.7. ALT. Enter the altitude flown since the previously logged position.
       11.6.2.8. GD/AD. Ground distance/air distance. The ground distance flown since the last fix or
       position if the data will be used to compute the ground speed (position to position computations).
       If the line is a ground plot DR line, enter the computed ground distance (from ground speed and
       time) for the DR position. If the line is used for air plot, enter the air distance computed from true
       airspeed and time since last fix or position.
       11.6.2.9. TIME. Enter the time corresponding to the distance used in paragraph 11.6.2.8.
       11.6.2.10. GS. Ground Speed. Enter computed ground speed for position to position data. Enter
       an average ground speed from Doppler, INS, SCNS, or GPS if the system information is reliable.
       Not required for air plot only positions.

NOTES:

          1. When flying designated Category II portions of the route, no entries are required in the
             actual or proposed sides. ETA/ATA blocks on the flight plan portion satisfy log require-
             ments.
          2. On Category I routes, when Doppler, INS, SCNS, or GPS, are providing reliable informa-
             tion, only time, position, average true heading, average true airspeed, altitude, and spot
             wind entries are required on the actual side for a full-line entry.
   11.6.3. Proposed Side:
       11.6.3.1. The PROPOSED side of the log will contain "the best known information" required to
       proceed to a point or abeam a point down track indicated in the CHECKPOINT block. When an
       entry is the same as the entry above it, a check mark may be used to indicate "same as previous
       entry."
       11.6.3.2. TAS. Enter the proposed true airspeed between present logged position and the next
       position.
       11.6.3.3. TC. Enter the measured true course to the next position.

         11.6.3.4. W/V. Wind and drift block. Enter the best known wind information in the W/V block.
         A spot wind from Doppler, INS, SCNS, or GPS may be used. Enter a computed drift correction or
         spot drift correction in the DC block. Drift correction and ground speed will correspond with the
         wind used.
         11.6.3.5. All blocks on the proposed side of the log require entries except in the following circum-
         stances:
             11.6.3.5.1. On portions of flights designated Category II.
             11.6.3.5.2. On departure, approach, and other segments of the flight under positive radar con-
             trol.
             11.6.3.5.3. When numerous alters for weather, traffic, etc., make the accomplishment of the
             entries impractical.
         11.6.3.6. REMARKS. Use the REMARKS sections to record pertinent information and events
         along with times of the events. Remarks will include, but not be limited to, clearances, equipment
         malfunctions, computer updates, navigator changeovers, and alter headings. Alter headings may
         be individually plotted or averaged to obtain DR positions.
      11.6.4. Clearance/Remarks. Enter ATC clearances as discussed in paragraph 11.1.3. When practi-
      cal, record assigned ATC frequencies on departure and approach in this section. Use this section to
      record other pertinent flight information as required.
      11.6.5. Nav Aid Data. Use this section to record actual and corrected readings (if applicable). Com-
      pare Doppler, INS, SCNS, MC, and GPS positions (latitude and longitude, or distance-to-go and cross
      track) for each position fix. At minimum, record the integrated navigation solution. If a navigation
      solution is updated, record its incorrect position and show that it was updated (in remarks section).
      Fix data substantiated by ICAO identifier or coordinates in the position block on the actual side of the
      AF Form 4116 need not be duplicated in this section.
      11.6.6. Calibration. Use this section for true airspeed and heading deviation checks.
         11.6.6.1. Heading Checks. See AFPAM 11-216 (formerly AFM 51-40), Air Navigation, for
         additional information. Use exact longitude (degrees and minutes), LHA, declination (DEC), and
         latitude to interpolate for exact ZN (use the "15/45" rule for this interpolation). Zn, headings, and
         deviations should be recorded or computed to the nearest tenth. All blocks are self-explanatory
         except the following:
             11.6.6.1.1. DEV/CORR. Use this block to record INS, SCNS, or GPS deviation from actual
             heading and corrections to be applied to computer heading.
             11.6.6.1.2. COMPUTER. Record INS, SCNS, or GPS, displayed heading in this block.

NOTE:
Regardless of the method used, ensure the sextant vertical retical is properly aligned or apply an appropri-
ate correction.
         11.6.6.2. True Airspeed Checks. All blocks are self-explanatory except the following:
             11.6.6.2.1. IOAT. Indicated outside air temperature. Not applicable for aircraft with operable
             TOAT displays.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              131


          11.6.6.2.2. TOAT. True outside air temperature. Apply correction to IOAT for heat of com-
          pression error (obtained from the aircraft performance manual). For aircraft with operable
          TOAT displays, enter the displayed value.
          11.6.6.2.3. IAS, CAS, EAS, TAS. Use the ICE-T method in AFPAM 11-216 (formerly AFM
          55-40) to convert indicated airspeed (IAS) to true airspeed (TAS). Use the appropriate flight
          performance manual for airspeed corrections. On aircraft with TAS displays from operable air
          data computers/transducers (ADCs/ADTs), enter only the displayed TAS value. Where two
          values are displayed from different ADCs/ADTs, enter the average of the two values.

NOTE:
For 280, 290, and higher true airspeeds, navigators on all C-130 models may use 0 knots for IAS to CAS
correction, and minus 3 knots for CAS to EAS correction. For true airspeeds below 280, use minus 2
knots.
          11.6.6.2.4. ITAS. Indicated true airspeed. Read directly from the true airspeed gauge.
          11.6.6.2.5. CORR. Correction to ITAS. Subtract ITAS from TAS.
          11.6.6.2.6. ITAS. Indicated true airspeed. Subtract indicated true airspeed (read directly
          from the true airspeed gauge) from computed TAS. Result will be CORR (correction to the
          ITAS). Navigators should also check the SCNS/Mission Computer TAS for accuracy.

11.7. En route Procedures. Heading deviation checks are not required on Category II or low level
routes.
   11.7.1. Category I Routes. On Category I routes or route segments, compute a heading deviation for
   each system being used as soon as practical after initial level off or coast out. Record deviation for all
   compass systems. On aircraft with reliable single INS or SCNS with a reliable INS, accomplish an
   initial heading deviation check to validate the INS heading. If INS heading differs from both com-
   pass-derived headings by more than 2 degrees, perform a celestial heading check. On dual INS
   equipped aircraft, if the INS true headings agree within 2 degrees of each other, they may be used in
   lieu of celestial heading checks as the primary heading reference.
   EXCEPTION: A deviation check is not required on flights transiting Category I routes of 2 hours or
   less if: the aircraft is equipped with two or more operable heading systems (the standby compass is not
   considered a system for this requirement).
   11.7.2. True Airspeed Checks. Compute a true airspeed check within 1 hour after reaching the ini-
   tial cruise altitude and each change greater than 4,000 feet after the initial check. Aircraft with an
   operable and reliable air data computer or transducer need only accomplish a true airspeed check at
   the initial cruise altitude. EXCEPTION: A true airspeed check is not required on low level routes.
   11.7.3. Fix Interval. Time between recorded positions (full-line entries on AF Form 4116, actual and
   proposed sides) will not exceed 1+20. Under normal conditions, 1 hour or less is the recommended
   time between recorded positions.
       11.7.3.1. Immediately report malfunctions or loss of navigational capability which will degrade
       course centerline accuracy to the air traffic control center (ATCC).
132                                          AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         11.7.3.2. Provide en route data for AF Form 72, Air Report (AIREP), for flights outside the con-
         tiguous US when required by computer flight plan.

11.8. Celestial Procedures:
      11.8.1. Precomps. Numerous specialized techniques are discussed in AFPAM 11-216.
      11.8.2. Celestial Heading Checks. See AFPAM 11-216 for a comprehensive discussion of celestial
      concepts.

11.9. SCA/Airborne Radar Approach Procedures:
      11.9.1. VFR Operations. Units will submit VFR ARA approach plates for approval to NAF Stan/
      Eval (MAJCOM Stan/Eval if no NAF exists). During VFR, the minimum ceiling and visibility will
      be 1,500 feet and 3 miles. Publish approved VFR ARA approaches in Chapter 10. Chapter 10
      should include SCNS ARA input data. If available, pilots will back up the navigator using a published
      instrument approach.
      11.9.2. IFR Operations. Refer to AFI 11-202V3, Chapters 5 and 8, and paragraph 16.6.4. for
      Self-Contained Approaches (SCA). Weather minimums will be established non-precision airfield
      minimums, or 300 feet and 1 mile, whichever is higher.
      11.9.3. Use ground-based radar monitor, where available (IFR and VFR).
      11.9.4. Planning and Coordination. Prior to entering the terminal area, the navigator will coordi-
      nate the following items with the pilot (see ARA briefing guide, AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-5):
         11.9.4.1. Desired pattern altitude and headings.
         11.9.4.2. Distance on final where descent will commence.
         11.9.4.3. Guide slope angle and initial rate of descent (normally not greater than 400 feet per
         NM).
         11.9.4.4. Minimum descent altitude and missed approach. Missed approach will conform to pub-
         lished procedures for a useable approach, if available.
      11.9.5. Terminology and Procedures:
         11.9.5.1. Pattern Control. The navigator will advise the pilot when positive radar identification
         of the airfield complex is made.
         11.9.5.2. The navigator will direct the aircraft by headings to the final approach course. For
         AWADS equipped units, navigators may advise the pilot to intercept the bank steering bar (as
         requqired) when flying computer ARAs.
         11.9.5.3. During the approach, the navigator will advise the pilot of the drift and groundspeed. If
         pilots can view this information on the selected SCNS/INS display, this advisory is not required.
         11.9.5.4. The turn onto base leg (if required) should be made to allow for a 10 NM final (or as
         required).
         11.9.5.5. The navigator will state the distance from touchdown each mile from the end of the run-
         way beginning 10 miles out. A glide path warning should be given 5 seconds prior to the "begin
         descent point."
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                          133


      11.9.5.6. The navigator will give heading information at least every nautical mile during the final
      approach. Rescue units are authorized to perform computer ARAs called self-contained
      approaches (SCA) VMC or IMC according to paragraphs 11.9.1. and 11.9.2.
      11.9.5.7. Use Chapter 5 procedures for required non-precision approach calls upon reaching the
      MDA.

11.10. Grid Procedures:
   11.10.1. Definitions:
      11.10.1.1. Grid North. Grid north is the direction of true north along or parallel to the Green-
      wich meridian. Along the 180 degree meridian (Polar charts), true south is the direction of grid
      north.
      11.10.1.2. Grid Direction. Grid direction is measured from grid north, clockwise through 360
      degrees, using any grid line drawn parallel to the 0 degree meridian.
      11.10.1.3. Grivation. Grivation is the angle measured between magnetic north and grid north. It
      is used to obtain a magnetic heading (MH) from a grid heading (GH). Grivation is applied to GH
      in the same manner as variation is applied to true heading (TH).
      11.10.1.4. Convergence Angle. Convergence angle is the product of the longitude times the con-
      vergence factor. A table for convergence angles at each degree of longitude is available in the
      margin of each navigation chart using the grid overlay.
      11.10.1.5. Convergence Factor. Convergence factor is the ratio existing between meridians as
      measured on the charts and the difference in degrees of longitude between them. The convergence
      factor is printed on each chart that uses the grid overlay.
      11.10.1.6. Precession. Precession experienced during a given period of time equals the actual
      aircraft grid heading (GH) minus the gyro reading (GR).
      11.10.1.7. Precession Rate. Precession rate is the precession converted to an hourly rate.
      EXAMPLE: Precession = 2 degrees, period = 30 minutes; rate = 4 degrees per hour.
   11.10.2. Grid Formulas:
      11.10.2.1. Northern Hemisphere:
          11.10.2.1.1. Grid direction = true direction +W (-E) longitude (polar chart) or convergence
          angle.
          11.10.2.1.2. Grivation +W -E = +W -E longitude (polar chart) or convergence angle.
          11.10.2.1.3. Mag direction = grid direction +W (-E) grivation.
          11.10.2.1.4. Grid heading = Mag heading -W (+E) grivation.
          11.10.2.1.5. Grid heading = True heading +W (-E) longitude (polar chart) or convergence
          angle.
      11.10.2.2. Southern Hemisphere. Reverse the sign of the longitude or convergence angle in the
      preceding formulas.
          11.10.2.2.1. For gyro steering:
134                                          AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


            11.10.2.2.2. Grid heading - gyro reading = precession.
            11.10.2.2.3. To alter heading: Initial grid heading (IGH) = desired grid heading (DGH) + or -
            1/2 hourly precession rate x DR time.
            11.10.2.2.4. Average grid heading: Mean grid heading between any two time periods.
            11.10.2.2.5. RT/2 correction: Hourly precession rate {R} x DR time {T} divided by 2. (If
            precession is +, correction is -.)
      11.10.3. Grid Log. The navigator will use this section on page 4 of the AF Form 4116 when grid
      navagation procedures are required. Block entries are as follows:
         11.10.3.1. Time. Time of celestial heading/system heading observation.
         11.10.3.2. TH. Observed/computed true heading.
         11.10.3.3. CA/LONG. Enter +W -E longitude (polar chart) or convergence angle.
         11.10.3.4. GH. Observed/computed grid heading.
         11.10.3.5. GYRO #1, GYRO #2. On aircraft equipped with two independent gyro stabilized sys-
         tems with numbers corresponding to aaircraft systems (e.g., C-12 No.1, N-1 No.2), circled number
         denotes the primary steering gyro. On aircraft whose systems are not numbered or do not corre-
         spond to the aircraft system, identify the primary steering gyro on "REMARKS."
         11.10.3.6. GR. Gyro reading. Record the reading from the primary compass.
         11.10.3.7. PREC. The amount of precession since the last heading shot (period precession): GH
         - GR = PREC.
         11.10.3.8. RATE/CUM. The hourly precession rate based upon the precession indicated at the
         time of observation. Precession rate is detived from the period precession and the applicable
         elapsed time period (since the last compass reset). EXAMPLE: 2 degrees precession in 40 min-
         utes equals a 3 degrees/hour precession rate. This entry is required only when period precession is
         greater than 1 degree. The cumulative portion of the block is used for tracking the cumulative pre-
         cession rate once a false latitude has been set.
         11.10.3.9. LAT. The mid-altitude between the current observation and the next proposed obser-
         vation.
         11.10.3.10. FALSE LAT. The false latitude setting being used to eliminate precession. This
         entry is required only when a false latitude setting is used.
         11.10.3.11. RESET. Whenever a gyro is reset, place a check mark in this block.
         11.10.3.12. GC. Measured grid course to the next checkpoint.
         11.10.3.13. DRIFT. The number of degrees (+ or -) of drift.
         11.10.3.14. DGH. Desired grid heading. Apply anticipated DRIFT to GC.
         11.10.3.15. RT/2 CORR. See paragraph 11.10.6.6. and formula on the bottom of the AF Form
         4116.
         11.10.3.16. IGH. Initial grid heading. Used for alter heading. See paragraph 11.10.6.6. and for-
         mulas on the AF Form 4116.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             135


       11.10.3.17. GRID ENTRY. Apply grivation (GRIV) to Magnetic Heading (MH) to obtain
       desired grid heading (DGH); or apply (LONG) or convergence angle (CA) to True Heading (TH)
       to obtain DGH. See formulas on the AF Form 4116.
       11.10.3.18. GRID EXIT. Apply GRIV to DGH to obtain MH; or apply LONG or CA to DGH to
       obtain TH. See formulas on the AF Form 4116.
   11.10.4. Grid Celestial Computations:
       11.10.4.1. When plotting celestial lines of position (LOPs) in grid reference, apply longitude
       (polar chart) of convergence angle to the true azimuth and plot the grid azimuth.
       11.10.4.2. When taking heading checks at high latitudes, it is advisable to place data into the peri-
       scopic sextant to give the true heading and convert this heading to grid by applying the assumed
       LONG/CA.
   11.10.5. Departure Requirements:
       11.10.5.1. Polar true/grid courses as reflected in FLIP terminal charts will be used for departures
       in polar areas. Before takeoff, visually align the aircraft with the runway heading and set the polar
       true/grid course of the runway in the aircraft's directional gyros. The navigator will set applicable
       systems in gyro mode with the correct latitude set.
       11.10.5.2. After reaching flight altitude, determine the polar true grid heading and reset the pri-
       mary and secondary gyros. The type of chart being used will determine whether the heading will
       be polar grid heading or convergence grid heading.
   11.10.6. En route Requirements:
       11.10.6.1. The Grid Entry/Exit section of the AF Form 4116 will be completed prior to heading
       reference changes. When entering grid operation, spot grivation should be applied to the com-
       puted magnetic heading to obtain desired grid heading (DGH). The aircraft will be established on
       the computed magnetic heading prior to resetting the heading references. When exiting grid, the
       computed magnetic headings will be the target heading when the compass systems are reset. In
       both cases, the computed magnetic headings will be compared to the flight plan to verify the accu-
       racy of the courses measured and conversion data used. This will ensure the validity of initial
       entry headings and provide precise target headings for exit.
       11.10.6.2. Normally, the grid heading will be checked each 30 minutes after grid entry. If the
       compasses are precessing 3 degrees per hour or less, hourly checks may be obtained after the first
       hour.

NOTE:
On aircraft with reliable SCNS/INS, if the SCNS/INS heading is within 2 degrees from a known reference
(i.e., surveyed runway headings), the SCNS/INS may be used to determine gyro precession.
       11.10.6.3. Determine the precession information for each gyro after each heading check. When a
       gyro's precession is greater than 1 degree, reset the gyro to correct grid heading. When the period
       precession is 1 degree or less, the navigator may either reset the gyro or treat the precession as
       zero.
136                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         11.10.6.4. Whenever the period precession is greater than 1 degree (optional for 1 degree or less),
         the hourly precession rate will be removed by use of a false latitude setting. When the combined
         earth rate and gyro precession are less than +15 degress/hour, the false latitude setting will totally
         compensate for precession. Two considerations are necessary:
            11.10.6.4.1. Predicted precession becomes zero.
            11.10.6.4.2. It may be necessary to adjust previous DR and air plot positions if the precession
            rate changes at subsequent heading checks. If this occurs, adjustments normally will be small
            and have neglible effect on DR and air plot accuracy; however, the effect should be consid-
            ered.
         11.10.6.5. To determine false latitude correction, enter the earth rate table with the desired latitude
         and extract the tabulated earth rate value. Algebraically combine the earth rate value and the
         observed hourly precession rate (use cumulative precession rate once a false latitude has been set).
         Re-enter the earth rate table with the combined value and extract the corresponding false latitude.
         11.10.6.6. Only 15 degrees/hour can be removed by a false latitude setting. When the sum of
         earth and primary gyro precession rates exceeds +15 degrees, the navigator must artifically steer
         the aircraft (in effect, the aircraft will fly a gentle arc) to compensate for the amount of precession
         in excess of +15 degrees/hour. The formula used to correct the desired grid heading (DGH) to an
         initial grid heading (IGH) to fly appears on the AF Form 4116 as "RT/2 CORR" (note that the for-
         mula produces a correction, so the precession rate (RT) must be given its opposite sign). The pre-
         cession rate (RT) used in the formula must be adjusted to reflect the time period in the DR ahead.
         When "carrying" precession as suggested above, the navigator should consider several aspects of
         the navigational problem:

NOTE:
When precession exceeds 15 degrees per hour, consider the compasses unusable.
            11.10.6.6.1. If alter headings are not made at heading check times, precession will have accu-
            mulated by alter heading times and a correction (opposite sign of precession) should be
            applied to the IGH using the total precession correction (TP CORR) portion of the AF Form
            4116.
            11.10.6.6.2. If the precession rate changes at subsequent heading checks, it may be advisable
            to adjust previous DR and air plot positions described at paragraph 11.10.6.6.
      11.10.7. Miscellaneous Procedures:
         11.10.7.1. Normally, when changing charts or crossing the 180 degree meridian, only the refer-
         ence changes; the heading of the aircraft is not altered. The change is made by comparing the grid
         courses and applying the difference to the gyro reading (old chart GC 350 degrees; new chart GC
         331 degrees; GR 353; 350 - 331 = 019 = 334; reset the gyro to read 334).
         11.10.7.2. Do not use the combined rhumb line/coriolis correction when flying DG. Use only
         coriolis correction for celestial observations.
         11.10.7.3. Always recheck computations and formulas when a radical change in precession is
         observed.
         11.10.7.4. Grid-certified navigators will maintain proficiency in SCNS grid procedures.

                                                 Chapter 12

                          FLIGHT ENGINEER PROCEDURES AND FORMS

12.1. General. In addition to duties in the flight manual and other applicable TOs, flight engineers will
comply with the procedures and duties specified in this volume. Except for ferry flights, hostile environ-
ment repair, and C-130 Operations with suspected fuel tank foam fires these items need not be briefed and
will be performed as normal procedures. The aircraft commander may assign other duties to the flight
engineer as necessary.

12.2. Authority to Clear Red X. Flight engineers are not normally authorized to clear a Red X. In a sit-
uation where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are unavailable, the home
base maintenance officer may authorize the flight engineer to clear the aircraft for flight. Flight engineers
are authorized to sign off Red X entries for Intake and Exhaust inspections, and panels for security when
away from home station without the maintenance officer's approval. Other crewmembers are not autho-
rized to clear a Red X.

12.3. In-Process Inspections. All flight engineers must be aware of their responsibility to perform
in-process inspections when clearing Red X symbols. During the assembly or reassembly of an item at
those stages where further assembly will prevent the required inspection of the item, an in-process inspec-
tion will be performed. Document the in-process inspection. (Refer to T.O. 00-20-1.)

12.4. Refueling/Defueling. Flight engineers normally are not required to refuel or defuel C-130 aircraft;
however, the flight engineer may refuel and defuel when maintenance personnel are unavailable. Use the
appropriate checklist during all refueling and defueling operations. If ground support personnel are not
available, the aircraft commander will designate other crewmembers to assist the flight engineer.

12.5. Forms Management. In addition to the procedures in T.O. 00-20-5 and AFI 11-401, the flight
engineer will assist the pilot in maintaining the AFTO Form 781. Verify the exceptional release is signed
before starting engines and resigned, if necessary, at en route stops. After each flight, ensure the number
of discrepancies (if any), landings, flight duration time(s), etc., are entered on Aerospace Vehicle Flight
Status and Maintenance Document (AFTO 781H). Review all Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Doc-
ument (AFTO 781A) discrepancies and ensure clear, detailed entries are made, symbols, date discovered,
and when discovered codes are entered for each discrepancy and the discovered blocks are signed.

12.6. Flight Monitoring. The flight engineer will monitor aircraft systems during all phases of flight and
ground operations. Notify the pilot of all abnormal indications and take action as required.
      12.6.1. Maintain outside vigilance when flight deck duties allow.
      12.6.2. Monitor the primary radio, interplane radio, interphone systems, and HOT LISTEN.
      12.6.3. Advise and assist the pilot in maintaining required climb and cruise power.
      12.6.4. Backup the pilots in monitoring terrain following (TF)/low level operations.
      12.6.5. Ensure both heading markers are set correctly during the turn point briefing.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              151


   12.6.6. Ensure pilot and copilot radar altimeters are set correctly for the specific TF/low level alti-
   tude.
   12.6.7. State "17,000" over interphone when any engine torque approaches this value.

NOTE:
In the event of an inadvertent over-torque the following criteria should be carefully considered in regards
to continued aircraft operations or mission accomplishment:
   Torque > 19,600 in lb. < 21,500
       781A entry, historical tracking only, no inspection required.
   Torque >21,500 in lb. < 23,000 in lb.
       781A entry, visual inspection within 25 hours.
   Torque > 23,000 in lb. < 23,260 in lb.
       781A entry, maintenance required for NDI and engine mounts change within 25 flight hours
   Torque > 23,260 in lb.
       781A entry, mag plug check and if reduction gearbox oil pressure is lower then before over-torque
       the reduction gearbox may need to be changed.

NOTE:
The 25 flight hour criteria is based on flight time to return the aircraft for maintenance. ACC aircraft that
experience an over-torque that exceeds 23,000 in pounds of torque are to immediately return the aircraft
for inspection/maintenance.
   WARNING: Failure to comply with this criteria could result in catastrophic structural failure.
   12.6.8. Notify the pilot when any of the following is noted:
       12.6.8.1. Deviation of more than 200 feet from assigned altitude.
       12.6.8.2. The aircraft configuration is incorrect for the maneuver being performed.

12.7. Tactical Checklists. When the pilot initiates a tactical checklist, read and ensure timely comple-
tion of all checklist items.

12.8. C-130 Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD) Cards (AF Form 4120):
   12.8.1. Complete TOLD card for takeoff prior to the BEFORE STARTING ENGINES CHECKLIST.
   12.8.2. Use AF Form 4120, C-130 Takeoff and Landing Data Card. Complete data applicable to
   the type of takeoff and landing to be made (i.e., landing distance for normal landing; ground roll for
   assault landings).
   12.8.3. Record computed data in accordance with the flight manual and this volume.
   12.8.4. Base all performance data on 100 percent engine efficiency. If 100 percent engine efficiency
   is not obtained, calculate performance data using 95 percent engine unless mission requirements dic-
   tate otherwise.
152                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


      12.8.5. Accomplish TOLD card computations using performance manual data, approved tabulated
      data, or TOLD computer.
      12.8.6. Record adjusted speeds to be used; i.e., record minimum control speed (one engine inopera-
      tive in ground effect) as take-off speed if minimum control speed is higher than computed takeoff
      speed.
      12.8.7. Computed data must equal or exceed the requirements of this volume.
      12.8.8. Following initial takeoff and landing, only affected speeds need to be reaccomplished if
      favorable conditions afford an additional margin of safety in all other areas (e.g., gross weight
      decreases due to fuel burnoff, while pressure altitude and temperature remain constant). New data is
      required for pressure altitude changes of 1,000 feet, gross weight changes of 5,000 pounds, or temper-
      ature change of 5 degrees C.
      12.8.9. When stop-and-go operations are planned, the flight engineer will compute refusal distance,
      either using reduced power TIT or maximum power. The engineer will compute stop-and-go dis-
      tances by entering the refusal speed chart (backwards) with the take-off speed (corrected for Vmca if
      required), intercepting all necessary corrections to the baseline.
      12.8.10. The minimum TOLD card computations (airspeeds) required for a termination landing are:
      air minimum control speeds, obstacle clearance speed, three engine climb speed, and 50 and 100 per-
      cent landing speeds.
      12.8.11. Rescue HC/MC-130 aircraft performing static line personnel drops will compute a Mini-
      mum Operating Speed (MOS). Place this information on the TOLD card. Compute data using power
      off stall speed with 50 percent flap setting at 30 degree bank angle plus 5 knots.
      12.8.12. If squadrons want to use a mini TOLD card, it must be submitted through individual Group
      Stan/Eval offices for approval, who will in-turn submit information copies to MAJCOM/DOT.

12.9. Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). Complete an AFTO Form 151A, Individual
C-130 Aircraft Usage Log, in accordance with 1C-130-101 on all flights.

12.10. Aircraft Fuel Usage Log (AF Form 4108). Maintain AF Form 4108 in accordance with para-
graph 12.10.1. of this volume. Coordinate with the navigator for fuel reading clock times.
      12.10.1. In-flight Fuel Logging Procedures. The following instructions standardize the use, com-
      pletion, and maintenance of AF Form 4108.
         12.10.1.1. Responsibility. The flight engineer assigned to the flight will complete the AF Form
         4108 whenever the navigator completes the Range Control Chart. The log may also be filled out
         as necessary for training and to maintain flight engineer proficiency.
         12.10.1.2. Purpose. AF Form 4108 is sufficient for normal ACC operational requirements and is
         used as a simple method of recording aircraft fuel usage data. When additional data is required for
         identifying trends in engine failure, performance, or for special test programs, the directing head-
         quarters will furnish necessary forms and instructions.
      12.10.2. Instructions for AF Form 4108. Form heading entries are self-explanatory.
         12.10.2.1. Block 1 - Fuel Gage Pounds. A record of aircraft fuel quantity indicators before and
         after flight.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            153


       12.10.2.2. Block 2 - Weight Data. Record the operating weight and the cargo/passenger weight
       from the DD Form 365-4. Ramp fuel weight is obtained from Block 1. Use the middle blank
       space for last minute changes prior to engine start or as otherwise required.
       12.10.2.3. Block 3 - Fuel On/Offload. Enter the total weight of fuel On/Offload during air refu-
       eling.
       12.10.2.4. Block 4 - Pax/Cargo Offload. Enter the total ammo expenditure weight and or weight
       of Pax/cargo offload extracted during flight.
       12.10.2.5. Block 5 - Engine Start Z. Enter the time (GMT) the last engine was started.
       12.10.2.6. Block 6 - Condition. Enter the symbol depiction per the flight condition as follows:
           12.10.2.6.1. WU/TAXI/TAKEOFF - Indicates warm-up, taxi, and takeoff conditions.
           12.10.2.6.2. [1↑Climb]. Initial climb is indicated by the symbol "1↑". Subsequent climbs are
           shown as "2↑", "3↑", etc. The number indicates the sequence of segments. Climbs of 4,000
           feet or less will not be recorded separately but will be included in the preceding cruise seg-
           ment. When constant climb is maintained to cruise altitude, use fuel flow reading taken at 2/3
           climb altitude. When constant climb cannot be maintained to cruise altitude due to ATC clear-
           ances, etc., enter the difference between the sum of the individual fuel quantity gage readings
           at the beginning and end of the climb..
           12.10.2.6.3. Cruise operating conditions are indicated by the number in the cruise sequence
           and an arrow such as "1→", "2→", etc. Instrument readings will be average for this period.
           Normally, cruise entries will be no more than 60 minutes. However, for the first cruise imme-
           diately prior to en route or step climb and the last cruise prior to descent may be no less than
           30 minutes, nor more than 90 minutes.
           12.10.2.6.4. Descents are shown as "1↓", "2↓", etc. Do not confuse descent with the final let-
           down that occurs when landing procedures begin. The loss in altitude during final letdown is
           indicated by "L&T". Landing and taxi is that condition from the end of the last entry in the
           sequence of descents/cruise to engine shutdown on the ramp. Holding time during an
           approach must be accounted for as an additional cruise condition after descent when necessary
           (30 minutes holding or more). Descents of 4,000 feet or less will not be recorded separately
           but will be indicated in the preceding cruise segment. When descent exceeds 4,000 feet,
           Blocks 10 through 18 need not be accomplished.
           12.10.2.6.5. Helicopter Air Refueling (HAR) and Air Refueling (AR) Operations. Cruise,
           climb, or descent time to refueling altitude ends approximately at start of on/offload. Indicate
           segment with "HAR 1" or "AR1", "HAR 2" or "AR 2", etc., in condition Block as appropriate.
           Blocks 10 through 18 need not be accomplished. Blocks 19, 20, 22, 25, and 28 entries not
           required for AR. At completion of on/offload, a new cruise, climb, or descent segment will be
           initiated.

NOTE:
Rescue, search, combat, combat support, or any special mission which requires constant variations in alti-
tude and airspeed may use the same procedures as AR/HAR operations. For this type of condition use an
"S 1", "S 2", etc., in the condition Block.

                                      LOADMASTER PROCEDURES

13.1. General. In addition to the duties established in applicable TOs and other directives, the loadmaster
will comply with the procedures and duties in this volume. The aircraft commander (AC) may assign
other duties as necessary. The loadmaster will:
      13.1.1. Plan loads; handle troops and passengers; prepare equipment for airdrop and supervise load-
      ing, tie-down, and offloading of cargo, baggage and mission equipment. NOTE: This will be accom-
      plished using AFI 11-2HC-130V3, Addenda A, HC/MC-130 Configuration Mission Planning, as
      guidance.
      13.1.2. Participate in the aerial delivery of equipment, supplies and personnel.
      13.1.3. Participate in aerial recovery of personnel and equipment.
      13.1.4. Remain in the cargo compartment when passengers are onboard.
      13.1.5. Perform scanner duties during flight in hostile environments.
      13.1.6. Perform scanner duties during air refueling operations and formations.
      13.1.7. Perform hot refueling supervisor and panel operator duties during hot refueling operations.
      13.1.8. Remain in the cargo compartment for takeoffs and landing. When the passenger load requires
      two loadmasters, or a loadmaster and another qualified crewmember, then both personnel will remain
      in the cargo compartment. One will remain forward and one aft for takeoffs and landings.

13.2. Additional Aircraft Loadmaster Responsibilities:
      13.2.1. Normally all air freight, fleet service, and servicing personnel are authorized to perform
      assigned duties in all ACC aircraft when escorted by an authorized individual. Air freight personnel
      are responsible for completion of cargo documentation, palletizing, and movement of cargo to and
      from the aircraft. They will advise the loadmaster of destination, size, weight, and type of cargo (clas-
      sified, hazardous, etc.) to permit proper positioning; coordinate traffic activities that may affect load-
      ing and offloading; and assign sufficient air freight loading personnel for cargo handling. Air freight
      personnel are responsible for safe positioning of material handling equipment and cargo to and from
      aircraft cargo ramp or auxiliary ground loading ramps. Air freight personnel under the direction of the
      loadmaster, prepare the aircraft for loading or stowing loading equipment if the aircraft is not to be
      reloaded, tie-down, and physically offload cargo. If cargo, aircraft equipment, or aircraft structure are
      damaged during loading or offloading, or if loading personnel are injured, the loadmaster will notify
      the AC, command post, or terminal operations officer.
      13.2.2. The loadmaster is responsible for aircraft preflight; load planning; preparation of DD Form
      365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F; operation of aircraft equipment; supervision and
      direction of loading, offloading, tiedown; and coordination with loading crew supervisor for checking
      the cargo against manifests. The loadmaster is responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of
      the aircraft.
      13.2.3. At locations with no air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes responsibilities in
      paragraph 13.2.1.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            159


13.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Maintain emergency exits and safety aisles IAW AFI
11-2HC-130V3, Addenda A.

13.4. Air Cargo Restraint Criteria. Restrain cargo IAW TO 1C-130A-9 or AFI 11-2MC-130V3, Chap-
ter 5, during infil and exfil operations.

13.5. Preflight Duties:
   13.5.1. The loadmaster will normally report to the aircraft immediately after the crew briefing or as
   directed by the AC to begin preflight and loading duties.
   13.5.2. ACC aircraft do not routinely airlift channel cargo; however, if so tasked, contact the air ter-
   minal operations center (ATOC), airlift control element (ALCE), or air freight/passenger service to
   obtain the cargo and passenger breakdown and assist in planning of proposed load. Security require-
   ments for ammunition and weapons will be briefed to the loadmaster during the initial load briefing at
   ATOC.
       13.5.2.1. At stations where aircraft tiedown equipment is exchanged, make every effort to ensure
       that a one-for-one exchange occurs. If this is not possible, the loadmaster will inform the AC of
       lost or missing equipment and annotate missing items on the Aircraft -21 Equipment Inventory,
       refer to AFTO 781.
   13.5.3. Passenger Missions:
       13.5.3.1. ACC aircraft will not normally be tasked to support AMC passenger missions, nor will
       passengers be manifested or loaded aboard ACC aircraft without the prior approval of the aircraft/
       mission commander.
       13.5.3.2. Prior to releasing seats, ensure terminal operations passenger handling personnel are
       aware that passenger comfort latrine facilities are extremely limited, and of the possibility of an
       in-flight diversion.

13.6. Passenger Handling. Ensure all classified equipment is covered prior to passenger boarding. The
loadmaster is the key figure concerning good passenger relations. Be aware of the doubts and fears which
may arise in the minds of passengers and anticipate their questions and actions.
   13.6.1. Passengers may move about the cargo compartment. Good judgment must be exercised on
   the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at one time. Encourage passengers to keep seat
   belts fastened when seated.
   13.6.2. Do not allow passengers to lounge on or tamper with equipment, cargo, or baggage.
   13.6.3. Ensure that classified equipment remains covered during the entire mission when passengers
   are onboard and ensure passengers are denied access to this equipment.

13.7. Troop Movements. Most personnel carried aboard ACC aircraft are aboard to perform a specific
mission. Every effort should be made to advise them of mission progress and deviations. The troop com-
mander should be identified prior to boarding.
   13.7.1. Determine if the troop commander has any special requirements prior to departure, and advise
   the AC of these requirements, if appropriate.
160                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


      13.7.2. Determine if specific communications requirements exist and coordinate these requirements
      with the AC and ACS.
      13.7.3. Determine if there is a need for the troops to perform any type of in-flight rigging. Ensure the
      aircraft is loaded to accommodate in-flight rigging if required. Inform the AC prior to in-flight rig-
      ging. If turbulence is anticipated, the AC should inform the loadmaster as much in advance as possi-
      ble.
      13.7.4. Ensure that troops do not have access to classified equipment during the mission. If troops
      require access to classified equipment, the requirement should be made known to the AC prior to the
      mission.

13.8. Border Clearance. Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture require certain forms for border clear-
ance. The loadmaster will ensure that required forms are contained in the aircraft mission kit. Distribute
the forms to the crew and ensure their completion prior to landing; deliver them to the proper persons.
Also comply with the requirements of this volume.

13.9. Weight and Balance. Accomplish weight and balance for the aircraft IAW TO 1-1B-50. A basic
handbook of weight and balance, TO 1-1B-40, containing current aircraft status, is maintained by the unit
possessing the aircraft which provides a supplemental weight and balance handbook for each aircraft.
This supplemental handbook is in a wear-resistant binder and may not contain TO 1-1B-40 if a certified
copy of Chart C provides the current basic weight, basic moment, and basic index. The binder will
include the applicable TO 1C-130X-5 and sufficient copies of DD Form 365-4. Also maintain AFI
11-2HC-130V3, Addenda A.
      13.9.1. Compute weight and balance by using the Chart E mathematical (moments) method. Com-
      pute DD Form 365-4 IAW AFI 11-2HC-130V3, Addenda A.
      13.9.2. The weight and balance section of the unit possessing the aircraft is responsible for providing
      the appropriate agency with information required to keep documents current and accurate.

13.10. Fuel Weight Computation. To compute fuel weight entered on the DD Form 365-4, read directly
from each gauge and compute the sum for total fuel weight. Compute limiting wing fuel computations
using the charts in the appropriate flight manual or AFI 11-2HC-130V3, Addenda A.

13.11. Supporting/Supported Forces Procedures. The loadmasters will ensure forces are properly
manifested as passengers. Give one copy of the manifest to the AC for filing and retain sufficient copies
for border clearance. The loadmaster will complete anti-hijacking requirements for forces IAW this vol-
ume.

13.12. Pyrotechnics:
      13.12.1. General. This section provides information in preparation for launching pyrotechnics. Ref-
      erence: TOs 11A10-24-7, 11A10-25-7, 11A10-26-7, 11A10-27-7, and 11A10-28-7.
      13.12.2. Hazards. In general, pyrotechnics contain materials of a hazardous nature. Even though
      each of the ingredients in a pyrotechnic composition may be relatively stable within itself, it may react
      with one or more of the other materials to cause deterioration and create an even greater hazard. Pyro-
      technics are more dangerous than many other types of ammunition because they are more easily acti-
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                           161


  vated. These items should not be handled roughly or exposed to moisture. When subjected to fire,
  most pyrotechnics burn with intense heat.
     13.12.2.1. Toxic Hazards. Many chemicals used in pyrotechnic devices are poisonous if taken
     internally. This also applies to the residues of burned pyrotechnics. From the inhalation stand-
     point, the products of pyrotechnic devices and smoke generators present a serious problem.
     Although most of the smoke and fumes given off by pyrotechnics are considered non-toxic, heavy
     concentrations in closely confined spaces are dangerous and may be lethal, for they reduce the
     amount of available oxygen in the air.
  13.12.3. Handling. Besides the hazardous basic compositions, pyrotechnics contain sensitive ele-
  ments such as fuses, friction compositions, and primers. Pyrotechnics should be handled with care
  and protected against moisture, shock, friction, or heat. Care should be taken to avoid premature igni-
  tion or damage that may cause failure when fired. Boxes containing pyrotechnics should not be
  dropped or thrown. Protective or safety devices should not be removed until just before use. Care
  should be taken to avoid damage to fiber cases and rip cords located outside the casing of flares. Pyro-
  technics should be handled so as to avoid denting or deforming the barrel or case. Do not use pyro-
  technics which are dented, deformed, cracked, broken, or have signs of advanced rust, loped closing,
  or have shipping covers with an illegible lot number, manufacture date, or other required identifying
  information. Pyrotechnics will be handled only under the supervision of a competent, qualified per-
  son. Most pyrotechnics burn with intense heat; therefore, personnel should be adequately prepared to
  handle an emergency situation (e.g., heat resistant gloves and broom).
  13.12.4. Storage. Units which have a requirement for storing pyrotechnics will obtain a license from
  the host base.
  13.12.5. Issue Procedures. Pyrotechnics which have been issued for training purposes will be
  marked in bold capital letters with the word TRAINING. These pyrotechnics will always be stored
  separately from operational stock within storage areas.
  13.12.6. Safety. All of the pyrotechnics described contain combustible chemicals which, when
  ignited, generate a flame or smoke (or combination of both) for a broad variety of purposes. These
  purposes include visual signaling, area or target illumination, and point marking. Most are intended to
  burn with intense heat.
     13.12.6.1. Initiation Mechanism. Pyrotechnic devices normally are equipped with some type of
     safety pin, lock, or tape designed to prevent accidental activation of the initiation mechanism.
     Any pyrotechnic which shows sign of damage to safety features is considered unserviceable and
     must be carefully segregated for prompt disposition by EOD.
     13.12.6.2. Accidental Initiation. If a pyrotechnic device should be accidentally ignited, in all
     cases its functioning will result in a fire hazard. The gases generated by this combustion could
     present a serious toxic hazard. Signaling devices containing propellant charges create an
     extremely dangerous missile hazard if accidentally ignited.
     13.12.6.3. Fighting Pyrotechnic Fires. Pyrotechnic compositions characteristically contain their
     own oxidants, and therefore do not depend upon atmospheric oxygen for combustion. For this
     reason, excluding air from a pyrotechnic fire usually is ineffective. Many pyrotechnic mixtures,
     particularly illuminating flare compositions, burn with intense heat up to 4,500 degrees F. Nor-
     mally, available extinguishers are of little or no value in fires of this kind, and in addition, may
     produce toxic or poisonous gases.

         13.12.6.4. Safe Altitudes and Distances. Flares not entirely burned out and cooled when they
         land may ignite combustible material. Safe altitudes and distances depend upon the burning time,
         rate of descent, and drift of the flare. Such factors will be considered in determining minimum
         altitudes and distances of release. Signal flares are also a potential fire hazard when the parachute
         fails to support the signal properly.
         CAUTION: Flares will not be launched over areas subject to fire except in an extreme emer-
         gency. If such an emergency exists, flares should be dropped from sufficient altitude to allow
         complete burnout before hitting the surface.
         13.12.6.5. Reporting Instructions. Prepare instructions for mishaps, accidents, and incidents
         IAW AFI 91-204. Prepare unsatisfactory reports IAW TO 00-35D-54.
      13.12.7. Pyrotechnic Launch:
         13.12.7.1. Personnel launching pyrotechnics through open doors or hatches will wear a restraint
         harness (secured to the aircraft) or parachute, and will have arramed or heat resistant gloves and a
         broom or wood stick readily available in case of fire. Wearing nomex gloves when deploying
         pyrotechnics is recommended. When manually launching parachute flares from the aircraft, only
         the cargo ramp will be opened unless the mission dictates otherwise. (This is to assist in eliminat-
         ing pyrotechnics missile hazard.)
         13.12.7.2. The aircraft will be prepared for flare jettison prior to handling any pyrotechnic. All
         parachute flares hand launched from the ramp will use a 10 foot lanyard (see Figure 13.1., Flare
         Delivery Lanyard). The flare will be hand launched upon command of the pilot or designated
         crewmember.
         CAUTION: Personnel launching flares will ensure the lanyard system is clear of extremities and
         equipment before launching. Excess lanyard should be accordion folded and held against the
         body of the flare or taped with paper tape.
      13.12.8. Pyrotechnics Description and Operation:
         13.12.8.1. LUU-2/B, 2A/B; Flare, Aircraft Parachute:
            13.12.8.1.1. Description. The LUU-2/B, 2A/B is an air-launched parachute flare. It is 36
            inches long, 4.875 inches in diameter and rated as providing 2 million candlepower illumina-
            tion for approximately 300 seconds (5 minutes). Some uses are illumination of areas for crash
            landing, ditching, landing, target, dropping of supplies, hovering of rescue aircraft, etc.
            13.12.8.1.2. Operation. Remove the flare from shipping container and set desired feet of fall
            in flare timer end cap. A setting of 500 feet represents a time delay of 6.3 seconds. Recom-
            mend a launch altitude of 3,000 feet AGL which will provide a light at 2,500 feet AGL. The
            flare descends approximately 2,500 feet during burning and will burn out and dump at ground
            level. The snap hook in the lanyard package of the flare shipping container may be used for
            the flare attaching end. The 10 foot lanyard secured to a tie down ring near the aft end of the
            ramp will be attached to the lanyard or to the timer dial knob. Upon launch signal, toss the
            flare overboard from the rear of the ramp, or floor jettison port with ignition end out first (igni-
            tion end is opposite from the timer end cap). A force of 30 to 35 pounds is required to extract
            the timer dial knob and drogue cover strip. The knob and cover strip will remain with the
            static line. Retrieve the static line and remove the timer dial knob from the snap hook. Stow
            the timer dial knob until mission is over; then dispose of all residue.

       13.12.8.2. LUU-4B; Flare, Aircraft Parachute:
           13.12.8.2.1. Description. The LUU-4/B is an air launched parachute flare. It is 25.5 inches
           long, 4.875 inches in diameter, and rated as providing 1.6 million candlepower illumination
           for approximately 180 seconds (3 minutes). Uses are the same as the LUU-2/B, 2A/B.
           13.12.8.2.2. Operation. The flare altitude should be planned so as that burnout occurs
           approximately 300 feet AGL over water and higher over land. Recommend maximum deploy-
           ment airspeed of 200 KIAS due to possible failure of the parachute system. Manual launch
           procedures is the same as LUU-2/B procedures.
       13.12.8.3. LUU-2/B, LUU-2A/B, LUU-4/B Emergency Procedures:
           13.12.8.3.1. Premature Timer Release/Ignition in Aircraft or Storage Container. Nylon
           cord - Cut; Container - Taped; Pilot - Notified.
           WARNING: In the event the timer end cap is separated from the flare, do not pull on the
           nylon cord or the parachute. An approximate 50 pound pull on one of the suspension cables of
           the parachute will cause the flare to ignite. Return the flare to the shipping container and turn
           flare over to EOD at mission completion.
           13.12.8.3.2. Pre-ignition of Flare. Jettison flare or container immediately; Pilot -notified.
           WARNING: In the event of flare ignition, an attempt will be made to jettison the flare. In
           event of candle ignition, intense light, heat, and lethal gas will be experienced. Adequate res-
           piratory, eye, and hand protection will be sought as soon as emergency permits. Flare suppres-
           sion will be attempted as a last resort.
           13.12.8.3.3. Flare Breakaway Fails to Release. Static line - Cut; Pilot - Notified.
           WARNING: Packaged aircraft parachute flares dropped in excess of 3 feet or unpackaged
           flares dropped in excess of 1 foot shall be considered unserviceable.
       13.12.8.4. MK-6 MOD 3; Signal, Smoke, and Illumination, Aircraft:
           13.12.8.4.1. Description. This signal marker provides long burning (approximately 40 min-
           utes) surface smoke and illumination for day or night use. It is used to mark sightings at sea,
           make sea evaluations, marking a sea lane for night water landing, and to simulate targets for
           the firing of weapons. It may be used to provide smoke on land surfaces if a fire hazard does
           not exist.
           13.12.8.4.2. Operation. Prior to launching the signal marker, remove the adhesive tape cov-
           ering the pull ring.

NOTE:
Do not remove the four square patches of adhesive tape covering the metal caps in the holes from which
flame and smoke issue after ignition of the candle. At the time the signal is launched, the pull-type igniter
is actuated by hand.
           WARNING: The smoke signal has a 90 second ignition delay and must be launched immedi-
           ately after the igniter has been actuated.
164                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


             WARNING: Packaged signal markers dropped in excess of 10 feet or unpackaged signals
             dropped in excess of 5 feet shall be considered unserviceable, and reported to OO-ALC/
             MMWR, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5609.
             WARNING: Do not prepare more than two markers at a time, and do not remove more than
             four markers at a time from the storage container in-flight.
         13.12.8.5. MK-25 MOD 3; Marker, Location Marine:
             13.12.8.5.1. Description. This marker was designed for day or night use for all surface refer-
             ence point marking purposes which call for smoke and flame in the 10 to 20 minute range.
             13.12.8.5.2. Operation. To activate the marker, the base plate must be rotated from the safe
             to the armed position to allow the battery cavity ports to be opened. The ports are opened by
             pressing the two brass colored port plugs into the battery cavity using the thumb and forefin-
             ger. A one-pound force is required for plug removal. This device is considered to be a sealed
             unit until its base plugs (one or both) have been pushed in.
             WARNING: The MK-25 must not be returned to storage with the base plugs pushed in. The
             nose end of this marker must be kept out of line with the body or with other personnel at all
             times. If marker is initiated, the nose plug is expelled with considerable force creating a mis-
             sile hazard.
             13.12.8.5.3. Special Precautions. This marker may be converted for use in fresh water by
             adding 1/2 or 3/4 ounces of table salt or two salt tablets through the base plugs.

NOTE:
Converted markers will not perform as reliable in fresh water as unconverted markers in sea water.
             CAUTION: Be sure salt is not exposed to moisture before and during the conversion process,
             as moist salt may cause marker to ignite.
             WARNING: Converted markers must be used after adding salt. They must not be returned to
             storage. If not used, they must be jettisoned in-flight, over water.
             CAUTION: Packaged flares dropped in excess of 6 feet or unpackaged flares dropped in
             excess of 3 feet shall be considered unserviceable. Report to OO-ALC/MMWR, Hill AFB,
             UT 84056-5609
         13.12.8.6. MK59, Marine Location Dye Marker:
             13.12.8.6.1. Description. This marker is used to produce a daylight reference point on the
             ocean surface in the form of a dye slick. It is used to mark a sighting or as a signal in search
             and rescue operations.
             13.12.8.6.2. Operation. Open cardboard container. Tear end of outer foil dye marker bag.
             Do not tear inner plastic bag. Replace inner plastic bag in cardboard container. Drop from the
             aft end of the cargo ramp or from the flare launcher. The impact with the water will crush the
             cardboard container and release the sea dye.
      13.12.9. Rescue HC/MC-130 Flare Launcher Loading. The flare launcher may be loaded in-flight
      or on the ground. Takeoffs and landings may be made with the flare launcher loaded; however, the
      system will be deactivated.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             165


   WARNING: Do not load or unload the flare launcher tubes while the aircraft is taxiing.
   WARNING: The aircraft must be depressurized and the system deactivation switch (located on the
   winch operators control panel) placed in the deactivate position prior to landing. A flare should not be
   removed from the stowage area until the tube is ready to be loaded.
       13.12.9.1. Depressurize the aircraft.
       13.12.9.2. Place the deactivation switch to the deactivate position.

NOTE:
Prior to loading, open the manually operated hydraulic shut off valve (located approximately FS 850, left
side) for the flare launcher system. This will allow manual jettisoning of flare or smoke in the event of
accidental ignition during loading operations.
       13.12.9.3. Open the cover on the flare launcher tube and remove the old lanyard, or pull ring and
       cable assembly, if required.
       13.12.9.4. Using the handle on the spring-loaded ejector plate, pull forward on the plate and
       secure the handle over the hook at the top of the tube.
       WARNING: In preparation for loading of pyrotechnics, a pair of arramed gloves will be within
       reach, and a broom handle or similar item will be within immediate access to push out a pyrotech-
       nic in case of accidental ignition.
       13.12.9.5. Remove the pyrotechnic from its container or side wall storage rack, and place in the
       tube. Make sure the nose of the pyrotechnic is pointing downward and resting against the ejection
       door.
       WARNING: During the next procedure, take care not to allow the spring loaded ejector plate to
       slip from your grip and strike the flare.
       13.12.9.6. Unhook the ejector plate and ease it down against the top of the flare.
       13.12.9.7. Feed the end of the lanyard through the elongated hole in the ejector plate. Route the
       lanyard under the ejector plate handle, and attach to the hook at the forward end of the flare
       launcher tube.

NOTES:

           1. Ensure serviceability of the retaining clip on the flare launcher tube hook. A missing or
              bent retaining clip could allow the lanyard to disengage from the hook during launch oper-
              ations and deactivate the flare.
           2. All excess lanyard will be coiled in the recess at the top end of the flare, and held in place
              by the ejector plate. Slack in the launcher lanyard will be kept to a minimum to prevent
              fouling.
       13.12.9.8. Close the latch and flare tube cover.
       13.12.9.9. Repeat these procedures for each tube to be loaded.

           AIRBORNE COMMUNICATIONS SPECIALIST PROCEDURES AND FORMS

14.1. General. The terms Airborne Communications Specialist (ACS) and Radio Operator (RO) may be
used interchangeably in this and other publications. In addition to the duties established in applicable
technical orders and other directives, ACSs will comply with the procedures and duties in this volume.
The aircraft commander may assign other duties as necessary. The ACS will:
      14.1.1. Attend crew briefings to obtain all pertinent information on purpose, route of flight, mission
      objective, and communications requirements. Record pertinent mission information on the locally
      produced communications worksheet.
      14.1.2. Coordinate communications requirements, frequencies, and any special procedures necessary
      to ensure optimum communications coverage is provided.
      14.1.3. Sign out and maintain control of all COMSEC and classified documents required by the ACS
      during the mission. Encode, decode, and authenticate messages as required. Use authentication sys-
      tems to identify friendly units. Ensure all COMSEC and classified materials are returned to proper
      storage facilities. Only ACSs are authorized access to safes installed on aircraft.
      14.1.4. Preflight all communications equipment to ensure satisfactory operation.
      14.1.5. Ensure IFF/SIF Modes II and IV are set IAW mission requirements.
      14.1.6. Maintain continuous communications with C2 agencies and other mission/support aircraft as
      necessary. Use secure communications to the maximum extent possible. Mission tasking will control
      when and where secure communications are utilized.
      14.1.7. Provide a documented record of all pertinent events during the mission using AF Form 4122.
      14.1.8. Troubleshoot malfunctioning communications equipment in-flight. Communications equip-
      ment repair is limited to the scope of the appropriate aircraft technical order or equipment documenta-
      tion.
      14.1.9. Initiate and maintain communications with range control, combat control teams (CCT), spe-
      cial tactics squadron teams (STS), landing zone control officers (LZCOs), drop zone control officers
      (DZCOs), pararescuemen, and other ground parties during mission events. Establish and maintain
      communications with other agencies, including ATC, as directed by the aircraft commander.
      14.1.10. Establish emergency communications through the use of national or international procedures
      when directed by the pilot.
      14.1.11. Zeroize all cryptographic devices and clear classified frequencies prior to leaving the air-
      craft.
      14.1.12. Configure and operate carry-on command and control (C2) equipment on ACC aircraft or
      ACC-chartered aircraft as directed. ACSs flying on rotary-wing aircraft will successfully complete
      swimming, dunker, HEEDS, and other designated training courses prior to flying.
      14.1.13. Configure and operate secure voice, anti-jam voice/data systems, self-contained navigation
      system (SCNS), data-burst terminals (DBT), digital message data group (DMDG), airborne comput-
      erized communications terminals (ACCT), and other computer/data devices as required.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            169


   14.1.14. Secondary Duties:
       14.1.14.1. The ACS may assist the navigator with INS and SCNS (as equipped) operation; moni-
       tor altitudes, route progress (using appropriate charts), flight plan log, and time control IAW mis-
       sion directives as directed by the aircraft commander.
       14.1.14.2. The ACS may perform as a scanner on operational missions if primary duties will per-
       mit, with the approval of the aircraft commander.

14.2. Aircraft Interphone and Radio. The ACS will monitor the primary radio, normally UHF/VHF,
and interphone at all times except when the use of HF or SATCOM precludes monitoring these radios.
The ACS will notify the pilot before leaving and when returning to his duty station.

14.3. Communications Procedures. Communications procedures used during all phases of a mission
are directly related to the type of mission being flown. Each ACS will be knowledgeable of operational
environments described in 14.3.1. through 14.3.5.:
   14.3.1. Communications Checks. Communications checks made during preflight, en route and
   postflight will be IAW ACP 121, US Sup-2. It is the responsibility of the ACSs to be cognizant of
   their OPSEC requirements prior to making any communications checks.
   14.3.2. Nonmission Sortie. Most sorties not using either the "Low Level" or "Infil/Exfil" checklist
   will be considered a nonmission sortie. Allied Communications Publication (ACP) 121 series, as sup-
   plemented, prescribes procedures for HF communications between aircraft and ground stations for
   most circumstances. All ACSs must be proficient in the use of these ACPs in addition to ACP 122,
   131, 135, 160 (US Sup 1C), and Joint Army Navy Air Force Publication (JANAP) 146. Ensure
   long-range communications, normally HF, are established prior to departing VHF/UHF range.
   14.3.3. Mission Sorties. Will be IAW AFI 11-2HC-130V1 guidance.
   14.3.4. Communications Reports. Forward all ATC communications and associated air reports
   (AIREP) to ICAO aeronautical stations in accordance with FLIP General Planning, FLIP charts, and
   FLIP Flight Information Handbook (FIH). ICAO HF en route position reporting must be IAW FIH
   and applicable FLIP documents. Pass C2 and all other operational communications through the
   USAF HF/SSB Global Command and Control System (GCCS) or the dedicated command and control
   station assigned by the mission controlling authority.
   14.3.5. Classified Transmissions. If classified transmissions are made during a flight, power
   SHALL remain applied to the Cockpit Voice Recorder for at least 30 minutes after the final classified
   transmission is completed.

14.4. AF Form 4122, Airborne Radio Log. The ACS will complete a single AF Form 4122 for each
day's flight or flights.
   14.4.1. Radio logs are normally unclassified, however, if classified information is entered into the
   radio log, it must be properly marked. Complete the log IAW paragraph 14.10. File completed
   unclassified logs chronologically in a transitory file. Dispose of logs IAW AFR 4-20V2. Classified
   logs will be handled and stored IAW current security directives. Maintaining log entries is the lowest
   mission priority.

      14.4.2. An execution checklist may be used on certain flights. Annotate times in the appropriate
      blocks, if an execution checklist is used. If the execution checklist is unclassified, it may be attached
      to the radio log in lieu of duplicate log entries. If the execution checklist is classified, do not attach it
      to the radio log unless the radio log is also classified. A separate radio log will be maintained at all
      times.

14.5. Communications Worksheet. Each flying squadron will develop a local communications work-
sheet specifically oriented to its mission. The ACS will complete this locally produced communications
worksheet for all flights, IAW local instructions. The local communications worksheet must be designed
to be used both during mission planning and in-flight as a guide. At the completion of each mission this
worksheet may be destroyed.

14.6. Frequency Listing. Table 14.1. through Table 14.5. contain listings of frequencies that are com-
monly used. This list contains search and rescue, Citizen Band frequency conversion table, and the AN/
ARC-513 preset frequencies.

14.7. Weather Forecasts. For all flights outside the local area, the ACS will obtain the destination and
alternate (if applicable) forecasts, to include pressure altitude and temperature, before reaching the equal
time point and one hour prior to ETA. When marginal weather is expected, provide the pilot with earlier
forecasts and timely updates, to include alternate landing fields. Whenever SIGMETs are received from
any source, contact the nearest USAF weather facility to determine mission applicability.

14.8. Airborne Communications Specialist Information Guides (ACSIG). ACSIGs are used to con-
solidate communications information, procedures, policies, etc. for quick reference during mission plan-
ning, preflight, in-flight, and postflight duties. Group Stan/Eval is the approval authority for unit
ACSIGs. Each unit maintaining these guides will review them annually for currency and document the
review.

14.9. Form Adopted. AF Form 4122, Airborne Radio Log (locally produced forms are authorized with
MAJCOM approval).

14.10. AF Form 4122, Airborne Radio Log. Airborne Radio Log may be completed electronically or
by hand (manually). When completed manually, it should be filled out using a non erasable type ink.
Complete this form as follows:
      14.10.1. Log Heading. Complete the entire log heading for page 1. Headings of subsequent pages
      need only contain call sign, date, page number, mission, and operator's name(s).

     The last entry will be the statement "OFF WATCH" followed by the ACS's signature. On aug-
     mented missions, only the ACS sitting in the seat for takeoff is required to sign on and off watch.
     If other ACSs make log entries, they will place a double slash (//) at the end of the MESSAGE/
     REMARKS entry and initial the entry.
     14.10.5.2. ACSs may exchange watch by using ON WATCH/OFF WATCH entries. The ACS on
     watch at the end of the radio day will make an entry indicating the end of the current radio day and
     a separate entry for the start of the new radio day. The end of the radio day, (midnight Zulu) is des-
     ignated 2400Z, and 0001Z is the beginning of the new radio day. Radio log entries will read "2400
     NOTE LOG End RADAY" and "0001 NOTE LOG Begin RADAY."
  14.10.6. Abbreviations and operating signals (ACP 131), FLIP abbreviations and other aeronautical
  related abbreviations may be used in radio log entries. Use brackets, [ ], to enclose important infor-
  mation, simulated transmissions, transmission summaries, or any other information necessary in the

                            AUGMENTED CREWMEMBER DUTIES

15.1. Airborne Mission Commander Procedures:
   15.1.1. General. The information in this section is a ready reference for crewmembers performing as
   Airborne Mission Commander. It describes the mission and outlines specific crewmember duties.
   Duties are not all inclusive and crewmembers need to remain flexible when performing this mission.
   AMC duties will normally be performed by dedicated airborne command and control elements such
   as E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) or ABCCC. HC-130 aircraft will not nor-
   mally be tasked to perform AMC duties concurrent with performance of HAR or PJ/Equipment inser-
   tion. If the HC-130 is tasked to perform limited AMC duties, the following guidance should be used.
   15.1.2. Airborne Mission Commander (AMC):
      15.1.2.1. When tasked to perform AMC duties, the basic crew will normally be augmented by an
      additional pilot or navigator who will be the designated AMC aboard the aircraft. In the absence
      of an additional crewmember, the aircraft commander is the designated AMC.

NOTE:
AMC duties are outlined in AFDD 2-1.6, Combat Search and Rescue.
      15.1.2.2. Mission. The HC-130 AMC primary function is coordinating the CSAR effort between
      the combat search and rescue task force (CSARTF) and the Joint Search and Rescue Center
      (JSRC)/Joint Rescue Coordination Center (JRCC) in addition to monitoring the status of all ele-
      ments of the CSARTF during mission execution. The primary objective is recovery of isolated
      personnel. For CAF CSAR forces, the isolated personnel will most often be a downed crewmem-
      ber (DCM). Throughout this section, DCM is taken to mean any isolated personnel. The AMC
      will assume the JSRC function upon loss of radio contact with the JSRC.
      15.1.2.3. Responsibility. To provide maximum rescue coverage, the AMC aircraft normally will
      be established in a precautionary orbit or on ground alert as directed by the controlling agency dur-
      ing periods of increased mission activity or high risk missions. The AMC monitors and coordi-
      nates the CSAR effort by:
          15.1.2.3.1. Survivor Location. Notification of an emergency or CSAR mission may come
          from any source. The first step after authentication is to locate the DCM. The location, unless
          definitely known to be permissive, must be considered hostile. The CSARTF is formed to
          meet this potential hostile environment. All means available will be used to locate the DCM;
          for example, wingmen radar vectors by GCI, direction finding steers, forward air controllers,
          signals, intelligence, or electronic/visual search. During search in a hostile environment, the
          AMC must use discretion in subjecting aircraft to a threat environment. Search areas should
          be established by the AMC and high-fast flyers equipped with DF capabilities should be used
          for the search, if possible.
          15.1.2.3.2. On-Scene Commander (OSC). The AMC will confirm the OSC as soon as prac-
          tical to control the recovery effort. In the case of a self-appointed OSC (e.g., DCM's wing-
          man), the AMC will confirm the appointment and/or arrange for a replacement. The objective
          is to pass OSC duties to a "Sandy" trained pilot as soon as possible.
176                                       AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         15.1.2.3.3. Primary CSAR Forces. These forces are specifically trained for CSAR. The pri-
         mary force to be used will be a team of attack aircraft, usually from four to six using the
         "Sandy" call sign, and a flight of recovery helicopters. The "Sandy" call sign is used to desig-
         nate dedicated, specially trained, CSAR fighter assets. Normally, the lead "Sandy" will be
         designated the OSC upon arrival in the general vicinity of the survivor.
         15.1.2.3.4. Secondary CSAR Forces. These forces have neither a primary CSAR mission,
         nor are they formally trained in CSAR procedures: Forward Air Controllers (FACs), Army
         helicopters, CAF fighter aircraft, etc. As such, they may not be familiar with OSC duties.
         There will be times when the CSARTF is composed partially or entirely of these forces.
         Appointing an OSC must be done clearly, and the duties, functions, and responsibilities of the
         OSC may have to be briefed before the OSC can assume this role. Explain exactly what is
         required, how to locate the survivor, control of the recovery force, recovery of the survivor,
         protection of the recovery aircraft, and how to cope with hostile fire.
      15.1.2.4. Required Forces and Equipment. The AMC may request primary forces to proceed to
      the CSAR objective area. If these required forces are not readily available, the JSRC must coordi-
      nate with the air operations center to accomplish these taskings.
         15.1.2.4.1. Secondary Resources. Secondary CSAR forces required to provide RESCORT
         for rescue helicopters, or RESCAP for the recovery force, normally will not be solicited from
         their controlling agency. The approval to use secondary SAR forces normally is obtained
         through the JSRC. However, it may be necessary for the AMC to communicate directly with
         the controlling agencies; for example, Army Direct Air Support Center (DASC), Airborne
         Command and Control Center (ABCCC), AWACS, or Navy SAR controller, to obtain the nec-
         essary resources. All actions should be coordinated with the JSRC.
      15.1.2.5. Contingencies. The AMC must plan for contingencies. It takes time to obtain special
      equipment and ordnance, but rapid reaction is essential to the safety of the survivor. Those agen-
      cies who control needed resources for the rescue attempt must be notified as far in advance as pos-
      sible.
         15.1.2.5.1. FACs. Where tactical conditions permit, FACs may be employed. They can be of
         enormous assistance to the CSARTF, particularly in cases where the objective is within a
         FAC's assigned area. They are specifically trained to direct ordnance against ground targets
         and can provide a link between the recovery helicopters and fighter support. Fast moving
         strike aircraft have limited effectiveness in supporting the recovery helicopter without FAC
         assistance. FACs should be requested whenever possible and assigned as OSC until the
         CSARTF arrives. FAC aircraft may either be slow moving or fast moving. In areas of consid-
         erable threat by anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) or radar surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), fast mov-
         ing support aircraft should be used.
         15.1.2.5.2. RESCORT and RESCAP. If not specified in theater directives, the AMC should
         try to obtain a minimum of two flights of fighter bombers to suppress possible weapons fire
         near the survivor. If hostile fire is present, more fighter bombers may be needed. Past experi-
         ence has shown a FAC can control and use one flight of four aircraft every 10 minutes. If
         enemy air activity is considered a possibility, air superiority forces must be on scene before
         committing rescue forces.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                          177


        15.1.2.5.3. Ground Teams. Ground teams may be appropriate whenevery timely air recov-
        ery is not possible. Especially in circumstances where the DCM requires immediate medical
        attention or protection from hostile forces. CSAR Pararescuemen (PJs) are dedicated aircrew
        protection specialists responsible for the rescue, recovery, emergency paramedical treatment,
        and survival of DMSs. Insertion is by static-line or freefall parachute and may include aerial
        delivery of deployable inflatable watercraft or all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). PJ employment
        missions may require short duration ground operations to perform life-saving medical treat-
        ment, protect evading or injured personnel in a harsh environment, or assist in evasion to a
        suitable extraction site.
        15.1.2.5.4. Surface Vessels. Navy, Coast Guard, or other surface vessels should be consid-
        ered when recovery is near their area of responsibility.
     15.1.2.6. Providing Navigational and Intelligence Aid to the CSARTF. The AMC will pro-
     vide the following assistance: Position of the DCM, initial vectors to the area, hold areas, advice
     on the location of threats, suggested routes in and out of the recovery area, and initial vectors to
     emergency landing locations. The AMC should have complete intelligence information and the
     capability to obtain real time information such as survivor authentication data or intelligence con-
     cerning the CSAR objective area. The AMC must have secure communications frequencies for all
     agencies concerned such as:
        15.1.2.6.1. Army Direct Air Support Centers (DASC).
        15.1.2.6.2. Army ground units.
        15.1.2.6.3. Navy/Marine control units.
        15.1.2.6.4. ABCCC.
        15.1.2.6.5. Air Operations Center (AOC).
        15.1.2.6.6. Civilian agencies in area (as applicable).
        15.1.2.6.7. FACs
        15.1.2.6.8. Tactical strike aircraft.
        15.1.2.6.9. JSRC/JRCC (normally within AOC or JOAC).
        15.1.2.6.10. AWACS.
        15.1.2.6.11. Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGNET) Net.
     15.1.2.7. Monitoring Weather. The AMC can conserve resources by advising the JSRC of
     adverse weather conditions.
     15.1.2.8. Long-Range Communications Relay. The AMC provides long-range relay between
     the JSRC and the CSARTF. This function is critical to the command and control elements. The
     communications specialist is responsible for relaying the mission progress, requests for recovery
     resources, and requests for information as directed by the AMC or aircraft commander.
     15.1.2.9. Communications Discipline. The AMC is responsible for controlling and maintaining
     communications discipline within the CSARTF, and may assign the radio frequencies to be used
     by the various elements. During the recovery effort, it is essential that the helicopters and RES-
     CORT be given uninterrupted use of their frequency.

NOTE:
This element has proven to be one of the most difficult to control during recoveries. The AMC must not
allow extraneous use of communications.
         15.1.2.10. Obtaining and Committing Secondary CSAR Forces. All helicopters have some
         recovery capability. All aircraft have the capability for search, although some are limited by speed
         or endurance. Any aircraft with ordnance has some value in suppressing hostile fire. The ARMC
         must be aware of the capabilities and limitations of secondary forces and should be prepared to use
         them as needed.
         15.1.2.11. Rescue Coverage. The theater Air Tasking Order (ATO) will specify details of air-
         borne/ ground alert.
         15.1.2.12. Orbit Tactics. Orbits will be flown in the configuration specified in the appropriate
         operational guidance. Maximum fuel economy should be the guiding factor. The possibility of
         hostile fire will be carefully evaluated in determining orbit locations.
         15.1.2.13. Aerial Refueling/Airdrop. It is not recommended for the AMC to coordinate a recov-
         ery mission and perform aerial refueling or airdrop operations concurrently. Any fuel passed to
         the helicopters by the AMC aircraft will reduce the AMC aircraft's endurance. During the course
         of a mission, every effort should be made to have another HC-130 tanker available. When neces-
         sary, the AMC will direct the receivers to contact and rendezvous with the tanker in a permissive
         area, when possible, and return to the primary mission frequency after refueling.

                         RESCUE HC/MC-130 SPECIFIC EMPLOYMENT

Section 16A—Tactical Operations

16.1. Low Level Procedures:
   16.1.1. General. Low-level missions may be long-range and require a combat profile, with the
   low-level portion commencing before reaching the target area, or medium to short-range, with the
   entire mission being flown at low level. Such operations may include a landing, helicopter air refuel-
   ing, or an airdrop. In threat areas, no specific set of en route tactics can be selected as a best profile.
   It is critical to mission success that aircrews are familiar with AFTTP 3-1.
   16.1.2. Mission. The HC/MC-130 is a dedicated CSAR aircraft whose primary mission is to extend
   the range of CSAR helicopters by providing aerial refueling. It also deploys personnel, usually
   pararescuemen (PJs), and or equipment, providing direct assistance to isolated personnel if a delay is
   anticipated in the arrival of a recovery vehicle. The HC/MC-130 can operate in hostile or sensitive
   environments, where low observability is required, utilizing onboard defensive systems, countermea-
   sures dispensers, various radar systems, night vision goggles, and forward looking infrared systems
   (some aircraft) to perform low altitude ingress and egress and avoid detection/threats to provide heli-
   copter air refueling or conduct tactical aerial delivery or airland of personnel and equipment or sup-
   plies. Mission success is enhanced by minimum lighting, minimum communications, deceptive
   course changes, and preplanned avoidance of enemy radar, air defenses, lines of communication, and
   populated areas.
   16.1.3. Communications Security and Operations Security (COMSEC and OPSEC). Security is
   vital to all operations conducted in accordance with this chapter. The electronic environment may be
   hostile, with enemy ability to jam all communications radios and electronic transmission systems; to
   intercept and use intelligence information transmitted over nonsecure electronic systems and radios;
   and to pinpoint the position of the aircraft emitting any electronic transmission or signals. Consider-
   ation of OPSEC must be applied to all phases of mission planning and execution to avoid compromise
   of mission objectives.
   16.1.4. Crew Rest. Crews may expect long crew days and austere crew rest facilities that are not
   conducive to normal crew rest. Additionally, multiple time zone crossings and abrupt changes to cir-
   cadian rhythm increase crew fatigue. The ability of crews to get uninterrupted sleep is crucial to flight
   safety and ultimately mission success. Planners and supervisors must exercise extreme caution
   regarding crew rest. If possible, a flight surgeon should accompany the deployment as part of the staff
   package during contingency operations or exercises. HQ ACC/SG may authorize use of sedatives or
   stimulants, through either the unit or exercise flight surgeon.
   16.1.5. Checklists/In-flight Guides. Expanded checklist information is included in applicable
   attachments to this volume. Abbreviated checklists/in-flight guides are located in separate publica-
   tions called AFI 11-2HC-130V3, CL-1 and CL-2; and HC/MC-130 Crew Inflight Guide. The flight
   engineer reads all tactical checklists, unless briefed otherwise by the aircraft commander. Checklist
   items not applicable to the aircraft or mission being flown need not be challenged nor responded to
   (e.g., Air Deflector Doors - "Closed and Off" need not be challenged if air deflector doors were not
   opened).

      16.1.6. Definitions. The following definitions are to be used in planning procedures and discussions
      of the mission:
         16.1.6.1. Airborne Mission Commander (AMC). The commander serves as an airborne exten-
         sion of the executing component's rescue coordination center (RCC) and coordinates the combat
         search and rescue (CSAR) effort between the combat search and rescue task force (CSARTF) and
         the RCC or the Joint Search and Rescue Center (JSRC) by monitoring the status of all CSARTF
         elements, requesting additional assets when needed, and ensuring the recovery and supporting
         forces arrive at their designated areas to accomplish the CSAR mission. The AMC may be desig-
         nated by the component RCC or higher authority. The AMC appoints, as necessary, an on-scene
         commander.
         16.1.6.2. AN/AAR-44/47. Detects missile exhaust plumes and issues alarms and indications
         when they are detected.
         16.1.6.3. AN/ALE-40/47. Flare and chaff ejector system installed to deceive certain types of
         threats.
         16.1.6.4. AN/ALR-69. Radar warning receiver (RWR) which provides audio and video alerts to
         the crew when the system detects threat radar signals.
         16.1.6.5. Area Drop Zone. A geographical area encompassing a prearranged series of accept-
         able drop sites, up to 0.5 nautical miles on either side of aircraft track.
         16.1.6.6. Air Weather Service (AWS). Provides electro-optics support (e.g., tactical decision
         aids for aircraft using NVGs, laser designators, IDS/FLIR [some airplanes], etc.) to ACC forces,
         as required.
         16.1.6.7. Blind Drop Zone. A drop zone which is not marked.
         16.1.6.8. Brevity Code. Code words or acronyms used to identify mission elements or execution
         directions.
         16.1.6.9. CEOI. Communications Electronics Operating Instructions.
         16.1.6.10. Corridor Barrier. A real or imaginary barrier defining the outer maneuvering limits

     16.1.6.18. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). An altitude computed by adding 1,000 feet (2,000
     feet in mountainous terrain) to the highest elevation or obstacle within 10 NM of centerline or
     planned flight path, whichever is greater, and rounded up to the next 100-foot increment. ESA
     provides a safe altitude which ensures terrain clearance. A single ESA will be established for the
     entire route when there are no significant changes in topography. For routes where the terrain does
     vary significantly, a separate ESA may be established for route segments with similar terrain or
     obstacle elevations.
     WARNING: Operation under VFR clearance in IMC conditions is an emergency procedure dur-
     ing training and exercise operations, requiring appropriate IFF and radio calls to the area air traffic
     control agency. During contingency/combat missions, the necessity of flying "comm-out" in IMC
     must be weighed against terrain clearance capability and/or increased mid-air potential.

16.2. Mission Planning Procedures:
   16.2.1. Mission Feasibility. Prior to conducting comprehensive tactical mission planning, a plan-
   ning staff (consisting of representatives of applicable crew positions) determines if the mission can be
   completed. This must be accomplished rapidly, as these mission feasibility results will determine the
   "go" or "no go" decision from the tasking agency and AFTTP 3-1 should be used as mission planning
   guides.
   16.2.2. Mission Planning:
      16.2.2.1. General. The successful completion of low level operations depends in large measure
      upon comprehensive premission planning. Tactical mission planning will be completed prior to
      entering crew rest. Aircrews must be able to locate objectives from low altitudes. Flight planning
      emphasis should be placed on the environment at least 10 nautical miles either side of the intended
      flight path, including terrain features, lines of communications, population centers and threat
      areas. Missions should be planned and flown at the highest possible altitude that minimizes detec-
      tion. Where operationally feasible, collocate tanker and receiver Air Refueling Initial Points.
      Deconfliction will be by timing, altitude or both.
      WARNING: Mixing of multiple coordinate datums can cause significant navigational and target
      errors on Rescue HC/MC-130 missions. The consistent use of the same datum for all coordinates
      will greatly reduce these errors. Ensure the same datum is used to derive coordinates for SCNS
      initialization, turnpoints, and targets (LZs and DZs). If the aircraft is equipped with a GPS, ensure
      the same datum is selected in the GPS.
   16.2.3. Communications. It must be assumed that the enemy has the capability to monitor, intrude
   upon, or jam all communications. The success of these missions depends directly on responsive, reli-
   able, and secure command and control of all communications systems. If communications are
   required, they will be IAW the CEOI and execution checklists. All communications will be brief,
   encoded, or secure when possible and transmitted via the most appropriate means.
   16.2.4. NVG General. Certain crewmembers may be required to use NVGs on part or all of the mis-
   sion. These devices take available light from stars, ground lights, or the moon to enhance the vision
   of the wearer. Vision enhancement with NVGs is inversely proportional to altitude, the closer you fly
   to the terrain, the more the goggles can aid your vision. NVGs have some limitations and certain cau-
   tions need to be addressed:
188                                          AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         16.2.4.1. Depth perception is adversely affected by NVGs (i.e., weather may appear much farther
         away than it actually is; closing on another aircraft or descending toward the ground is not imme-
         diately noticeable).
         16.2.4.2. Terrain or other obstacles in the "shadow" of more distant or higher terrain may not be
         seen when wearing NVGs.
         16.2.4.3. Different colored lights cannot be distinguished (i.e., all lights appear to be the same
         color).
         16.2.4.4. Bright lights (direct or reflections) from internal or external sources seriously degrade
         the NVG wearer's vision. For this reason, black out the cockpit and mask appropriate lights.
         16.2.4.5. Haze, smoke, and low outside illumination due to overcast conditions or lack of ground
         light diminish the effectiveness of NVGs.
         16.2.4.6. Turning on NVGs in daylight or looking directly at bright sources of illumination will
         damage the light sensitive material in the goggles.
         16.2.4.7. Wearing NVGs for an extended period can cause extreme fatigue and "hot spots" on the
         face and head. Eye fatigue can be lessened by periodically breathing 100 percent oxygen and
         removing the NVGs to rest the eyes. NVG users must guard against mission degradation due to
         prolonged use.
      16.2.5. NVG Procedures:
         16.2.5.1. Pilots will use ANVIS-6 or 4949D goggles but will not mix the two types between pilot
         and copilot. If HUD modified goggles are used, the pilot and copilot will use the same type. Each
         primary crewmember will carry a set of NVGs on missions requiring NVGs. All individuals must
         perform a thorough preflight of their goggles. At the discretion of the aircraft commander, a spare
         pair of NVGs may be signed out for the flight.
         16.2.5.2. When NVG use is required, the pilots, engineer, loadmaster, airborne communications
         specialist, and all scanners should wear them or have them immediately available.
         16.2.5.3. When using NVGs, it is essential that specific crew duties and procedures during air-
         craft emergencies, inadvertent weather penetration, or RWR threat warning be determined in
         advance. Details such as who will fly the aircraft, who will transition from NVGs to instruments
         if needed, who will perform emergency actions, what maneuvers will be flown, cockpit lighting,
         etc., must be planned for and prebriefed.
         WARNING: Because of the time required to transition from NVGs to instrument flying, one set
         of pilot's filtered instrument floodlights should be illuminated (at the minimum level required to
         see the flight instruments with the naked eye) to enable quick transfer from NVGs to normal oper-
         ation.
         16.2.5.4. Cockpit lighting must be carefully adjusted prior to NVG operations. The objective is to
         have the cockpit as dark as possible to minimize reflection and glare that will interfere with NVG
         effectiveness. One at a time, the flight engineer and pilots should reduce instrument and flood-
         lights to a minimum. Caution and warning lights should be taped or covered if they represent a
         potential hazard (i.e., if a light comes on, the pilot may be temporarily blinded). Do not mask any
         caution or warning lights prior to transition to NVG operation, as masked lights may not be visible
         to the naked eye. See AFI 11-2HC-130V3, CL-1 and CL-2; and HC/MC-130 Crew Inflight Guide
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              189


       for a list of mandatory and optional lights to be masked. Mask lights until aircraft receive the
       NVIS modification.
       WARNING: Because of the distinct possibility of crewmembers experiencing spatial disorienta-
       tion during low level flight or low light air refueling, one pilot should be immediately ready to fly
       the aircraft should the other pilot become disoriented.
           16.2.5.4.1. When ANVIS 6 HUD modified goggles are the only HUD goggles available for
           SOFI aircraft, they should be used except under the following conditions: less than 20 percent
           illumination, an insufficient number of goggles to outfit the pilot and copilot or the HUD mod-
           ified goggles are deemed unacceptable by the aircraft commander.

NOTE:
The cross check that is required when using HUD modified goggles is a fragile skill that needs to be used
regularly. When using HUD goggles for the first time, or after a long layoff, there is an inherent tendency
to fixate on the display instead of "looking through" the display at the terrain beyond.
   16.2.6. NVG Planning Procedures--General:
       16.2.6.1. Make every effort to fly the route as planned. If unforeseen circumstances require devi-
       ation from the plan, make every effort to return to the planned route and profile as soon as possi-
       ble. The low level navigation problem is considerable since it is expected that most covert
       operations will use the cover of darkness. Accomplish obstacle avoidance at night using NVGs,
       radar, SCNS, IDS/FLIR (some airplanes), and radar altimeter along with flying segmented alti-
       tudes as necessary to ensure precise navigation. Higher altitudes up to MSA may be required.
       During initial mission planning for night missions with NVGs, provide specific information and
       factors necessary for detailed mission planning to participating crewmembers. Give particular
       emphasis to current and comprehensive intelligence data, weather analysis, and effective illumina-
       tion expected along the entire route.
       16.2.6.2. Portions of planned flights in IMC may be necessary to accomplish mission objectives;
       however, due to aircraft equipment limitations, operational employment in a low-level environ-
       ment should be considered a last resort. The pilot and navigator must consider the terrain and the
       accuracy of the altimeter setting before IMC profiles are attempted. During training, conduct
       planned flights in IMC under instrument flight rules (IFR).
   16.2.7. Training Limitations. All routes and route segments will be aligned so that the route perim-
   eter is clear of prohibited, special use, or restricted airspace as defined in FLIP, service, FAA, theater
   directives, and local operating procedures. Routes will be flown using visual flight rules. Routes will
   not be flown at altitudes and weather conditions less than those specified in AFI 11-202V3, FLIP, and
   this volume. NVG routes must have a 1,500-foot ceiling and 3 mile visibility or greater for training
   and exercises.
       16.2.7.1. Aircraft which do not meet the equipment requirements of this paragraph are restricted
       to MSA or to wing position in a formation. For day low level operations as lead or single-ship, the
       pilot's radar altimeter and at least the I-DOP function of the SCNS must be operational. For NVG
       low level operations as lead or single-ship, the pilot's radar altimeter, the APN-59/241 radar, and
       the I-INS function of the SCNS must be operational. If the I-INS function is inoperative, both the
       I-DOP and GPS must be operational for continued NVG Low-level operations.
190                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         16.2.7.2. Minimum illumination criterion for all NVG operations is 5 percent effective illumina-
         tion. Five percent effective illumination is equal to or greater than the value provided by starlight
         at ground level (clear, with no other ambient light). As a guide, use .87 mlux if a TDA is available.
         All environmental illumination factors for the planned route of flight should be considered.
      16.2.8. Threat Analysis and Degradation. Missions flown in hostile environment should expect to
      encounter enemy opposition from both ground-based defenses and enemy aircraft. Employment plan-
      ners and mission commanders must be prepared to plan and employ tactics which minimize the effects
      of these threats. Crews must be thoroughly familiar with AFTTP 3-1.
         16.2.8.1. Threat Factors:
             16.2.8.1.1. Mobility of the System. Not only can a system be moved to intercept the pro-
             posed mission track, but traverse rates may allow continued engagement.
             16.2.8.1.2. Accuracy of the Guidance or Optics. The age of the system and its low level
             capability are factors.
             16.2.8.1.3. Range of the Weapon. Actual range of the weapon is usually given as maximum
             effective range. The minimum range also may be a factor.
             16.2.8.1.4. Range of the Acquisition Radar. The length of time that the radar will track the
             aircraft before it is within lethal range. Compute the altitude to which an aircraft can climb
             before radar detection. This is known as detection free altitude (DFA).
             16.2.8.1.5. Command and Control. The authority for firing the weapon may be far removed
             from the weapon location. Intelligence should determine who is the firing authority and how
             long it would take for the weapon system to receive the fire command.
             16.2.8.1.6. Accuracy of the Weapon. The accuracy may vary with altitude, the speed of the
             aircraft, and the distance the aircraft is from the weapon. Age and condition (maintenance
             readiness) will also be factors.
             16.2.8.1.7. Day versus Night Operations. Some systems may not be manned at night. Fur-
             ther, light conditions may affect optics and infrared guidance.
             16.2.8.1.8. Number of Missiles and Rate of Fire. The number of missiles that can be fired
             and at what interval; the practical rate of fire for Anti-Aircraft Artillery and the reload time.
             16.2.8.1.9. Weather Limitations. Moisture, heat, cold, wind limitations, electrical storms,
             temperature inversions, and clouds can all be factors, affecting not only the weapon, but also
             the personnel controlling the weapon.
             16.2.8.1.10. Weapon's Type of Terminal Guidance. This helps to evaluate the effectiveness
             of evasive tactics.
             16.2.8.1.11. Weapon's Type of Fusing and Fragmentation Pattern. This helps in predict-
             ing possible battle damage.
         16.2.8.2. Detection Factors:
             16.2.8.2.1. Passive or acoustical detection devices.
             16.2.8.2.2. Ground or sea observation posts or networks.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                           191


        16.2.8.2.3. Lines of communication, especially at points such as dams, bridges, and road
        intersections.
        16.2.8.2.4. Military maneuvers and exercises, including aircraft training routes.
        16.2.8.2.5. Boats and ships, including commercial or fishing vessels. Associated threats
        include visual and radar detection. Modern military vessels have sophisticated anti-aircraft
        detection and defense suites.
        16.2.8.2.6. Festival, holiday, or vacation gathering places.
        16.2.8.2.7. Satellite Schedules. This has become a significant threat in both the visual and
        electronic spectrum.
        16.2.8.2.8. Radars. Flights should be planned through areas that preclude radar detection,
        including airport approach and air route traffic control radar coverage. Modern radars have
        three significant vulnerabilities that should be exploited during mission planning. These are:
        limits on maximum range, degraded low-level detection capabilities because of the earth's cur-
        vature (radar horizon distance [RHD]), and the masking properties of obstructions between the
        antenna and the target aircraft (detection free altitude [DFA]). Equations or methods for deter-
        mining these parameters are found in Attachment 2 of this volume.
        16.2.8.2.9. Lasers. Aircrew should be aware of the effects that laser light has on both the eye
        and NVGs. The eye is the most sensitive of all tissues to laser light energy. Minimum effects
        are dazzling and/or flash blindness. Dazzling can obscure target areas and potentially cause
        disorientation. Flash-blinding causes a blindness similar to that of looking at a strong light
        source or flash bulb. Period of blinding can range from several seconds to minutes and can
        even cause permanent eye damage depending on intensity and duration of exposure. NVGs,
        by design, do afford a limited degree of protection since they are not a "direct view" optic (like
        binoculars) but present a TV image to the user. The NVGs themselves may bloom, shutdown
        or in extreme cases, incur immediate damage precluding further use. Effects on thermal imag-
        ing devices (FLIR) are similar to the effects on the NVGs.
     16.2.8.3. Threat Analysis. After analyzing the various threat and detection factors, adjust the
     enemy's threat capability for the advantages obtained by low-level penetration:
        16.2.8.3.1. Obtain "cookie cutter" distance for all threats. This is the maximum effective
        range of a particular system. For systems that have radar detection and shoot capability, i.e.,
        certain SAMs and AAA, two "cookie cutter" circles must be obtained: one for the maximum
        detection (see) range and the other for maximum lethal (kill) range. These distances can be
        obtained from various sources. An important factor that must be evaluated is the capability of
        the enemy's radar to "see" you versus his ability to "shoot" you. It may be acceptable that an
        enemy radar can "see" you, but the associated weapon cannot reach you. This decision
        depends upon the need for covert or clandestine operations and mission profile.
        16.2.8.3.2. Plot the orders of battle with the corresponding threat circles (detection and lethal
        ranges). Look for obvious holes in the radar coverage and plan your mission to fly through
        those gaps in coverage.
        16.2.8.3.3. If no gaps appear using the "cookie cutter" distances, you must now assess a
        low-level profile. To do this, use the charts in the DIA publication, Radar Handbook, Volume
        2 (S). The charts will give a new threat range that is corrected for altitude which should be less
192                                        AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


      than the "cookie cutter" distance. Replot the circles, using these distances to determine where
      gaps in coverage will open up for possible routes.
      16.2.8.3.4. The final alternative is a combination of a low-level profile with terrain-masking
      adjustments. There are several methods to calculate terrain-masking altitudes for aircraft;
      however, two methods are particularly simple to use. The first method utilizes the radar
      shadow length computer which incorporates curvature of the earth. The variables needed to
      enter this graph are: emitter elevation, intervening terrain elevation, intervening terrain dis-
      tance from the emitter, and aircraft distance from the emitter. Plotting these variables results
      in a DFA, or "mask altitude." This is the altitude the aircraft must be at or below to ensure that
      it will not be detected. See Attachment 2 for specific computations. The second method is to
      use a software package with the radar shadow length computer such as AFFMSS, CFPS/PFPS.
      Either method provides the same information. Advantages of the software programs are that
      no graph is required, and masking calculations are accomplished much quicker. The advan-
      tage of the radar shadow length computer is that you have a permanent worksheet to go back
      to for checking your calculations. After these calculations have been made, "gaps" should
      appear. This should be the routing you take to avoid detection. If no gaps appear, careful
      judgment must be made as to the hazard from the threat and consequences to the mission.
      16.2.8.3.5. DFENCES Checks. The DFENCES Check is an acronym for one technique used
      to prepare the crew and aircraft for enemy airspace penetration or for potential threats. The
      navigator generally calls for this checklist crossing the FENCE (a point along the route prior to
      the Forward Line of Troops: FLOT) to ensure optimum configuration and alert the crew of the
      upcoming threat environment. Optimally, the checklist is silent with each crewmember know-
      ing and accomplishing their applicable items automatically. However, in training the crew
      may elect to run through the items quickly over interphone. The acronym DFENCES stands
      for:

  16.2.9. Route Selection. Select the initial point based upon the safest run-in to the objective area
  with the least possibility of detection. To most efficiently choose the best course, work backwards
  from the IP to the staging base.
     16.2.9.1. Turning points and intermediate checkpoints should be recognizable visually or by radar
     whenever possible. In selecting navigation points, consideration should be given to minimizing
     aircraft radar use.
     16.2.9.2. Turns should not be made into significantly higher terrain or other hazards.
     16.2.9.3. Numerous course changes protect not only the aircraft, but also the objective area by
     confusing any attempt by the enemy to predict the flight path of the aircraft.
     16.2.9.4. Direct flight over built up areas should be avoided.
194                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         16.2.9.5. Do not plan routes that parallel major lines of communications.
         16.2.9.6. If areas defended by small arms must be crossed, they should be crossed at their narrow-
         est or least defended point.
         16.2.9.7. Plan the route by considering the detection factors, and using terrain masking to avoid
         detection.
         16.2.9.8. To the maximum extent possible, avoid egress along the ingress route.
         16.2.9.9. For daylight missions, do not overfly areas that contrast with the color scheme of the air-
         craft (such as water, mountain snow, or lighter colored terrain surfaces), if at all possible.
         16.2.9.10. Timing legs should be planned for necessary adjustments. If planned, timing legs or
         deviations for time control should be made prior to entry into enemy territory.
         16.2.9.11. Whenever possible, plan the leg course prior to the IP or ARIP, to be within 30 degrees
         of the run-in or AR track course.

16.3. Low Level En Route Procedures:
      16.3.1. Energy Management. Carefully consider performance data and energy management when
      planning low level operations, particularly in mountainous terrain at heavy gross weights, or with
      less-than-full engine capability. Failure to manage energy levels may cause a stall or inability to avoid
      rapidly rising terrain. Slips and skids can help dissipate energy quickly; however, uncoordinated
      flight increases airframe structural loading and should be avoided unless an actual threat exists. In
      addition, uncoordinated flight reduces stall margins and can cause abrupt departure from controlled
      flight.
      WARNING: The ability to see ahead of the aircraft both visually and electronically, may be reduced
      by mountain shadows and ridge line masking. Caution must be exercised to avoid exceeding the air-
      craft's capability to climb above or circumnavigate high terrain. Navigators should continually keep
      the pilots appraised of flight progress and anticipated terrain elevations, obstructions, climb points,
      and descent points.
      16.3.2. Threat Maneuvering:
         16.3.2.1. Evasive Maneuvers. Effective threat reaction maneuvers require clear, concise, and
         timely communication between crewmembers. Begin threat reaction calls with the word "Turn"
         when a 10 to 20 degree bank angle is required, "Hard Turn" when a 30 to 45 degree bank angle is
         required, and "Break" when a 60 degree bank angle is required. These are all visual maneuvers,
         and must be cleared by the pilot prior to initiation. During training, threat locations will be briefed
         on a specific leg or legs. Do not brief the entire route as a threat. This allows crewmembers to
         move about the aircraft without fear of injury from maneuvering. If weather or another event pre-
         vents flying in the briefed location, the threat location may be adjusted in flight.
             16.3.2.1.1. Jink. A jink is typically called in response to a AAA threat. The idea of a jink is
             to make the aircraft an unpredictable target without giving any extra exposure through hard
             turns or breaks. A jink is usually a turn in conjunction with altitude changes designed to con-
             fuse the enemy.
             WARNING: Practicing defensive threat maneuvering does not constitute authority to deviate
             from limitations in the flight manual or AFI 11-2HC-130V3.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                                195


       16.3.2.2. Formation Threat Maneuvering. There are many tactics available to enhance forma-
       tion threat survivability; defensive maneuvering is just one of these. Other tactics may include
       splitting up the formation and using separate routes, or varying formation geometry (greater spac-
       ing, fluid trail, line abeam) to cross a threat area. The optimal situation occurs when the ALR-69
       gives advance warning and all that is required is a deviation around the threat. As the immediacy
       of the threat increases, more maneuvering may be required. Maneuvering abruptly or at high "G"
       loads or high bank angles should be done only when the threat is in sight and no other course of
       action is available. Wingmen may have to break from the formation to ensure their safety. During
       training, emphasis on defensive maneuvering (both single-ship and in formation) should be on
       early identification and avoidance of threats. Any threat breaks in formation must be thoroughly
       briefed prior to flight, executed smoothly, and terminated immediately if flight safety is compro-
       mised.

NOTE:
A threat break done in formation IS NOT a formation maneuver. It is not required that you maintain your
normal spacing off other aircraft, and in fact, this is not necessarily desired. It is desirable to keep visual
contact with the preceding aircraft, but you must maneuver and dispense countermeasures as necessary to
survive the engagement. In peacetime, if you lose sight of the preceding aircraft during a threat maneu-
ver, make a radio call with your altitude and trend if climbing or descending, e.g. "King 91, #2's lost sight
climbing through 2000 feet." All aircraft will bring up there lights and lead will direct altitude separation
until the blind aircraft has the preceding aircraft in sight.
   16.3.3. Altimeter Updating. Altimeter update points should be planned for en route portions of the
   mission. Sources of update include weather forecast, ground reporting stations, and crew updates.
   Crew updating involves the comparison of absolute altitude (radar altimeter) plus terrain elevation to
   the pressure altitude when flying over a body of water or flat terrain. Obtain an updated altimeter set-
   ting as close to the objective area as possible. If this is not possible, use the lowest forecast altimeter
   setting.
   16.3.4. Altitudes. For threat areas, no best altitude can be specified. Appraisal of the threat provides
   the aircraft commander with the best decision parameters and allows for flexibility. Altitudes to and
   from the objective area range from very low-level to high altitude, as necessary to minimize exposure
   to the threat. Fly no lower than the threat dictates. Comply with AFI 11-202V3 and the following
   specified altitudes (during peacetime training):
       16.3.4.1. Day VMC. LAA will be 300 feet modified contour above the terrain (except when
       using Threat Penetration Altitude), by visual reference to both the terrain and the radar altimeter.
       Momentary terrain clearance deviations may be expected due to terrain variance.
       16.3.4.2. Night VMC (MSA). Equipment deficiencies may require flight at MSA. Fly each leg
       at an indicated altitude of 500 feet above the highest obstruction within 3 NM of planned flight
       path. When the altitude for the next leg is higher than the current leg altitude, climb must be com-
       pleted prior to the turn point. If the altitude for the next leg is lower than the current leg altitude,
       do not initiate descent until over the turn point. EXCEPTION: When the objective is identified
       and adequate terrain clearance is assured, the aircraft may descend from en route altitude.
       16.3.4.3. NVG Low-level. The standard for LAAs for NVG Rescue aircrews is modified con-
       tour. Crews may fly route segments or legs at night altitudes of no lower than 500 feet AGL mod-
196                                          AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


       ified contour (except when using Threat Penetration Altitude). The unit commander will
       determine which LAA aircrews will fly at based on experience, terrain, etc., and document aircrew
       NVG low-level qualification (pilots and navigators only) on the squadron letter of certification
       (letter of Xs).

NOTE:
Climb rate should be based on 1,000 feet per minute. At 220-240 knots ground speed, this equates to
approximately 4 NM per 1,000 feet of climb. For example, to climb 2,000 feet, begin the climb 8 NM
prior to the point at which the climb must be completed.
       16.3.4.4. Threat Penetration Altitude. Coastal penetrations or avoidance of a specific threat
       may require flying at altitudes lower than those mentioned in 16.3.4.1. and 16.3.4.3. Visual pilot-
       age is the primary height reference. Pressure and radar altimeters are secondary height references.
       Limit the time spent at threat penetration altitude to the duration needed to avoid the specific
       threat. During peacetime, the following restrictions apply:
           16.3.4.4.1. A certified mission pilot must be in the left seat or a mission IP/EP in either seat.
           16.3.4.4.2. The pilot's and navigator's radar altimeters must be operational.
           16.3.4.4.3. Restricted to flat or rolling terrain.
           16.3.4.4.4. Minimum Altitudes: day VMC - 200 ft AGL, NVG modified contour - 300 ft
           AGL.
           16.3.4.4.5. No "Break" calls. "Turn" or "Hard Turn" calls may be made but the pilots MUST
           be cautious of any descending vector that may develop, especially during a "Hard Turn".
           WARNING: Bank angles are severely restricted below 200 ft AGL; therefore, most turns
           require a climb prior to execution.
       16.3.4.5. Radar Altimeter Usage:
           16.3.4.5.1. Set radar altimeters no lower than 15% below the LAA (425 feet for 500 foot con-
           tour and 255 feet for 300 foot contour). Depending on illumination and proficiency, a higher
           radar altimeter setting may be appropriate. The pilot and navigator will use the same setting
           for their radar altimeters. EXCEPTION: NVG/assault landings using the Infil/Exfil Check-
           list.

NOTE:
Regardless of the radar altimeter setting you use, if you are below the desired modified contour altitude, a
correction to altitude should be made. Do not wait for the low light to illuminate to begin a correction.
This is especially important when using the lower limit on the radar altimeter.
           16.3.4.5.2. Any crewmember noting illumination of the "Low" warning light on the radar
           altimeter will use the word "Low" to indicate this to the pilot flying the aircraft. If the radar
           altimeters are set at the lower limit, an immediate altitude correction must be made.
       16.3.4.6. Emergency Procedures:
           16.3.4.6.1. Climb to MSA (unless compromising safety further, e.g., conflicting traffic, etc.)
           under the following circumstances:
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             197


               16.3.4.6.1.1. Aircrew disorientation.
               16.3.4.6.1.2. Aircraft malfunction.
               16.3.4.6.1.3. Inadvertent weather penetration.
           16.3.4.6.2. A further climb to ESA may be required.
           16.3.4.6.3. The route may be resumed after establishing a positive fix, the malfunction is
           resolved, or if VMC conditions are reestablished.
           16.3.4.6.4. Climb to MSA when either pilot must leave the seat during low level flight.
           EXCEPTION: If performing a planned seat swap for training with an IP in the seat, simply
           climb to a safe altitude.

NOTE:
Threats, terrain, weather, and mission priority are factors when considering a climb from the low-level
environment during contingency operations.
   16.3.5. Airspeeds (For Preflight Planning):
       16.3.5.1. Training Cruise. 210 KIAS, constant ground speed or as briefed.
       16.3.5.2. Combat Cruise. As briefed.

NOTE:
Airspeed may be adjusted to meet a desired time over target (TOT) or ARCT. Constant ground speed
option may be used. At sea level, this normally equates to approximately 220 knots GS.
   16.3.6. Time Control Procedures. Every effort will be made to arrive at the objective on time. All
   major time adjustments should be completed prior to arrival at the IP or slowdown, whichever occurs
   first. During planning, additional time should be considered for planned deviations. Provisions must
   be made in the flight plan if forecast winds are expected to preclude the fixed ground speed option. En
   route airspeed adjustments may not be available when operating at heavy gross weights. Doglegs and
   time pads may be required. If possible, a dogleg should be planned near the objective area, to allow
   final time adjustments by cutting off part of the dogleg.

NOTE:
Ensure that a threat analysis has been completed for any planned cutoff routing.
   16.3.7. Fuel Planning. For tactical low level operations, assume a 6000 pound per hour burnoff rate
   unless more accurate data is available.
   16.3.8. Mission Preparation. Thorough mission planning and exact mission execution are impera-
   tive to ensure mission success. All participating forces must be thoroughly briefed on all essential ele-
   ments of the mission. Typical items to be coordinated and briefed include threats, tactics to be used,
   timing, radio frequencies, ingress/egress routes, orbit points, backup plans, and escape and evasion
   procedures. Prior to tactical operations in the low level environment, accomplish the low level check-
   list.
       16.3.8.1. Personnel Preparation. All personnel will wear the survival and protective gear pro-
       vided during hostile environment operations. Such equipment, if available, may include, but is
198                                          AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         not limited to the following: flak vest, LPU, survival vest and kit, parachute/harness (chute
         readily available), and protective headgear.
         16.3.8.2. Aircraft Preparation. All equipment such as oil, pyrotechnics, excess seats, trash
         cans, etc., not essential to the mission should be removed from the aircraft prior to a combat mis-
         sion. Securely tie down all other equipment.
      16.3.9. Course Maneuvering:
         16.3.9.1. NVG Low-level. NVG low level navigation requires a high degree of crew coordina-
         tion in addition to extensive premission planning. Limiting factors are meteorological conditions,
         ambient light conditions, and terrain features. The following methods are to be employed to
         ensure a reasonable margin of safety under various night conditions:
            16.3.9.1.1. Flat Terrain and Adequate Illumination. In these conditions, a qualified pilot
            can be cleared to fly a set altitude as measured by the radar altimeter. Terrain avoidance will
            be primarily the responsibility of the pilot assisted by other crewmembers using NVGs. The
            navigator must carefully monitor the intended flight path of the aircraft and advise the crew of
            terrain features, obstacles, off-course deviations, and upcoming ridge lines or contours. The
            radar and radar altimeter are the primary references.
            16.3.9.1.2. Flat Terrain and Poor Illumination. If illumination is poor, the pilot must rely
            more heavily on navigator inputs, based on flight planning and radar interpretation, to provide
            additional terrain or obstacle avoidance cues.
            16.3.9.1.3. Hilly and Mountainous Terrain. In areas of rugged terrain, missions should be
            planned to fly no lower than necessary to avoid threat detection or engagement. Training
            flights will not be planned or purposely flown lower than 500 feet AGL. At times, the threat
            envelope may require flights below the height of obstacles within planned track boundaries.
            The ability to perform within this envelope requires frequent and regular practice in a simu-
            lated threat environment. Both visual and electronic capabilities must be closely coordinated
            to ensure adequate terrain clearance. The navigator will continually keep the pilots appraised
            of flight progress and anticipated terrain elevations/obstructions. The pilot uses this terrain
            elevation information in conjunction with the radar and barometric altimeters to assist in
            ensuring visual separation from terrain and determining the appropriate flying altitude. The
            ability to see ahead of the aircraft both visually and electronically may be reduced by mountain
            shadows and ridge line masking. Caution must be exercised not to exceed the aircraft capabil-
            ity to climb above or circumnavigate high terrain. Aircraft three engine climb capability
            should also be anticipated in rough terrain.
            16.3.9.1.4. Recommended Altitudes. The navigator will compute recommended altitudes
            for all NVG low level routes. A recommended altitude is an altitude which will provide a
            degree of terrain masking and terrain clearance (at least 500 AGL, or 300 AGL during threat
            penetration legs), provided the aircraft is on the preplanned flight path. Computation of rec-
            ommended altitudes should take into account terrain topography, turn radius of the aircraft,
            chart deficiencies, accuracy of the navigation system, threat environment, and crew experi-
            ence. Keep in mind that the pilot will rely more heavily on recommended altitudes as illumi-
            nation decreases. As a technique, base recommended altitudes on the terrain within 1-2 miles
            (based on navigation system accuracy) either side of planned deviation, and add the contour
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            199


          interval of the chart used for planning. Update recommended altitudes commensurate with
          terrain differences.
          16.3.9.1.5. Equipment Failure. Missions experiencing equipment failure en route may pro-
          ceed at the aircraft commander's discretion. Aircraft which do not meet the equipment
          requirements of paragraph 16.2.7.1. as lead or during single ship operations must climb to
          MSA.
          WARNING: Should either pilot's NVGs become inoperative, climb to MSA feet until NVG
          use is reestablished. This does not preclude the pilot from quickly attempting the other set of
          NVG batteries prior to climbing.
      16.3.9.2. Degraded Systems Training (DST). DST is used to prepare crews to accomplish the
      mission simulating certain pieces of equipment inoperative (or intentionally turned off for emis-
      sion control). On non-local routes, designate leg segments during the route brief. The following
      restrictions and procedures are designed to maximize training and safety.
          16.3.9.2.1. Restrictions:
              16.3.9.2.1.1. Greater than 10 percent lunar illumination.
              16.3.9.2.1.2. Visibility must be 5 SM in mountainous terrain.
              16.3.9.2.1.3. The pilot's and navigator's radar altimeters must be operational and on.
              16.3.9.2.1.4. The APN-59/241 radar must be operational.
              16.3.9.2.1.5. Must have a mission instructor or evaluator in either the pilot or navigator
              position.
              16.3.9.2.1.6. When simulating the AN/APN-59/241 radar inoperative, a mission instruc-
              tor navigator will act as a safety observer, and will monitor the progress of the mission
              using NVGs and navigation equipment.
              16.3.9.2.1.7. The SCNS INS must be operational and on during DST. IDCUs and flight
              director mode switches can be positioned to simulate the INS inoperative.
          16.3.9.2.2. Aircraft commanders will brief the following items:
              16.3.9.2.2.1. Equipment simulated inoperative.
              16.3.9.2.2.2. Aircrew coordination.
              16.3.9.2.2.3. Pilot and navigator duties.
              16.3.9.2.2.4. Disorientation and emergency procedures.

16.4. Chart Preparation:
   16.4.1. General Information. Information required to perform the mission must be annotated on
   navigational charts and supplemental objective materials using the symbols and annotations specified
   in this section. Successful completion of a low level mission requires complete and detailed construc-
   tion of the planned route on a minimum of a 1:500,000 (TPC or sectional). For mountainous terrain
   and objective area operations, a 1:250,000 (JOG) or larger scale chart should be used for detailed ter-
   rain elevation study. The entire route of flight from departure point to recovery point will be included
   on a chart. Since chart scale and route length may create large charts unsuitable for the flight deck
200                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


      environment, it may be necessary to strip charts into workable sizes. When stripped charts are used, a
      larger scale chart (i.e., ONC, JNC) will be prepared by the navigator to allow for major unplanned
      deviations during critical mission phases and emergency egress. The following general instructions
      apply:
         16.4.1.1. Use dark ink, pencil, or symbol tapes to portray course lines. Obstacles and other chart
         entries may be drawn or highlighted in any legible color.
         16.4.1.2. Print the ESA in bold numbers on the chart. When multiple ESAs are used, or when
         lengthy strip charts are used, the ESA will be annotated on each chart segment.
         16.4.1.3. The chart code, scale, and edition will be annotated or taped to the back of the chart (if
         stripped). The current Chart Updating Manual (CHUM) review date will also be annotated on the
         back of the chart.
         16.4.1.4. When transitioning from one chart to another, allow a sufficient route overlap.
         16.4.1.5. Center the symbols depicting checkpoints, objectives, and so forth on the point. Do not
         draw course lines through these symbols.
         16.4.1.6. Annotate on the chart the highest obstacle within three nautical miles of the planned
         deviation or centerline, whichever is greater.

NOTE:
This is the obstacle used to compute MSA for each leg.
         16.4.1.7. Draw course lines using either point-to-point or radius of turn.
             16.4.1.7.1. If using point-to-point, measure true course and distance from point-to-point.
             16.4.1.7.2. If using radius of turn use Table 16.1.

             16.4.1.7.2.2. Leg distance is the distance from a point formed by the right angle to the next
             turning point. It includes the turn radius and any planned off-course maneuvering.
     16.4.1.8. Annotate on the chart appropriate warning and advisory locations (e.g., 20, 10, 6, 1
     minute).
     16.4.1.9. Draw deviation lines when the planned route is different than the course line. Annotate
     magnetic heading information near these deviation lines (if desired) to aid in dead reckoning dur-
     ing significant turns.
     16.4.1.10. Normally, the pilot and copilot will each have a low level chart annotated properly for
     the route of flight. A single chart may be shared during flight. If this option is used, both the pilot
     and copilot must participate in premission route analysis and chart preparation using the single
     chart.
     16.4.1.11. Chart construction is a valuable and integral part of mission planning. It is desired that
     each crewmember prepare their own low-level chart. Color copies are acceptable provided the
     contour and contrast remain intact and the chart is used for preflight route study and the flight.
  16.4.2. Annotations and Symbols. The following annotations and symbols can be used in preparing
  maps, charts, and objective materials. Deviations in positioning are authorized to the extent necessary
  to preserve chart legibility or significant radar, visual, and relief features.
     16.4.2.1. Turn Point or Checkpoint. Use a circle to depict en route points where the aircraft
     course is altered and key en route positions such as navigation checkpoints (either radar or visual).
     Letter or number consecutively these points throughout the mission to facilitate easy identifica-
     tion.
     16.4.2.2. Initial Point (IP). Identify the IP or ARIP by a square centered on the point (cultural or
     natural) with the sides parallel to the final approach course line. If the IP or ARIP is simply a
     coordinate point, position a dot on the coordinate location centered within the square.
     16.4.2.3. Objective Area. Identify the objective area (i.e., DZ, LZ, or ARCP) by a triangle cen-
     tered on the area with the apex pointing in the direction of flight. Course line will extend to, but
     not into or through the triangle, and extend outward from the exit point. Use a dot to precisely
     locate the planned point of impact, landing zone, or air refueling control point.
     16.4.2.4. Emergency Recovery Bases. Use a single circle with a diagonal line to identify those
     airfields compatible with unit aircraft which may be used in an en route emergency. The number
     of emergency bases selected and the frequency of occurrence along the mission route are at the
     discretion of the mission planner. Planners may annotate airfield coordinates near the base.
     16.4.2.5. Alternate Recovery Base(s). Use two concentric circles to identify those airfields
     compatible with unit aircraft and preferred for recovery in case the primary recovery base is unus-
     able because of weather, damage, or other reasons.
     16.4.2.6. Not Used.
     16.4.2.7. Time/Distance Marks. Annotate time marks, distance marks, or both on the low level
     course line.
         16.4.2.7.1. Time Marks (Optional). Indicate time elapsed from the last checkpoint.
202                                        AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         16.4.2.7.2. Distance Marks. Indicate distance remaining to the next checkpoint. The incre-
         ment used between marks is at the option of the user.
      16.4.2.8. Route Width (Optional). Base route width perimeters on flight planned course. The
      route perimeter may be drawn on both sides of course centerline.
      16.4.2.9. Course Arrow Boxes. Use course arrow boxes to place essential navigation data on the
      route charts for each leg. Where the leg is split between two strip charts, use the course arrow box
      on both. The box will contain the magnetic course, distance, and MSA.
      16.4.2.10. Combat Entry and Exit Point. A heavy line identifies and locates the point at which
      the route crosses the forward line of troops (FLOT) as dictated by the combat situation.
      16.4.2.11. Operational Advisory Arrows. Annotations concerning operational aspects of the
      mission, located where the en route maneuver should be performed.
         16.4.2.11.1. Operational advisory arrows for climb or descent points for each leg or leg seg-
         ment where there are significant terrain or obstruction elevation differences.
         16.4.2.11.2. Climb rate should be based on 1,000 feet per minute. At 220-240 knots ground
         speed, this equates to approximately four nautical miles per 1,000 feet. For example, if you
         need to climb 2,000 feet, place climb advisory arrow eight nautical miles prior to the point at
         which the climb must be completed.

       bols and annotations to portray enemy OB information. Inclusion of threat capabilities may clas-
       sify the chart.

NOTE:
Classify charts depending on information sources and methods used to obtain this data (required only if
classification is CONFIDENTIAL or higher).
           16.4.2.12.1. Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM). The number associated with the symbol will
           indicate the specific type weapon system (that is, SA-2, SA-3, SA-6, etc.). The actual site
           location will be the base of the symbol. Indicate the effective range of the systems at the
           planned mission altitude.
           16.4.2.12.2. Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA). Depict AAA sites and indicate the type by a let-
           ter L, M, or H representing light, medium, or heavy weapons located at the site.
           16.4.2.12.3. Aircraft. Portray the location of enemy fighter aircraft capable of intercepting
           the mission. The delta-wing symbol will indicate all-weather capable aircraft and the
           swept-wing symbol will indicate a VFR only capability.
       16.4.2.13. Chart Preparation. Table 16.2. provides a quick reference for chart preparation.

16.5. Crew Duties. All crewmembers will perform normal crew duties as outlined in appropriate flight
manuals. Specialized duties are as outlined in the following paragraphs.

NOTE:
All crewmembers will monitor en route progress should an escape and evasion situation develop.
   16.5.1. Navigator Specialized Duties. Rescue HC/MC-130 aircraft will be manned with a single

          file.
          16.5.4.3.4. Transmits light signals as requested by the aircraft commander.

16.6. Infil/Exfil Procedures:
   16.6.1. General. Infil/Exfil procedures are typically used to transition from NVG low level to place
   the aircraft on final approach, properly configured, in a position to identify the landing area, complete
   a landing, conduct a rapid onload or offload (if required), and quickly return to low level flying. The
   approach and landing is a visual maneuver backed up with SCNS, IDS/FLIR (some airplanes), and the
   radar. It is flown similar to an airdrop run-in from IP to LZ. The Infil/Exfil Checklist is used during
   tactical operations and replaces the normal Descent, Before and After Landing, Before Takeoff, Line
   Up, and After Takeoff Checklists from appropriate flight manual. The checklist can be used by any
   mission qualified crew to make overt landings and by an appropriately qualified crew to make covert
   or blacked out landings. The Infil/Exfil Checklist is read by the engineer. All available crewmembers
   will assist the pilots in scanning during ground operations. Review appropriate flight manual and AFI
   11-2HC-130V3, Chapter 5, Infil/Exfil paragraphs prior to using these procedures. Specific proce-
   dures for onloading and offloading troops and equipment are contained in the ACC Loadmasters Infil-
   tration/Exfiltration Guide. See Table 16.3. for crew qualification requirements for various airland
   operations.

Table 16.3. Crew Qualification Requirements for Airland Operations.

   16.6.2. Restrictions:
       16.6.2.1. Aircraft must be equipped with an integrated GPS-SCNS and both the pilot's and navi-
       gator's radar altimeters must be operational for actual NVG landings.
       16.6.2.2. Weather must be VMC for training operations.
       16.6.2.3. Landing zone (LZ) and taxiway criteria will be IAW 11-2HC-130V3, Chapter 5. NVG
       landings will usually be to an AMP-2, AMP-3, or to a blacked-out runway. NVG landings on

         blackout runways are restricted to aircraft with an operational integrated GPS-SCNS solution,
         AN/APN-59/241 radar, and IR landing lights (or lens).
         16.6.2.4. Formation flights must separate to have a minimum of 1-minute landing intervals for
         NVG landings. This separation may be accomplished by wingmen executing a 360 degree turn or
         by slowing down at earlier points along the run in course.
      16.6.3. Mission Planning:
         16.6.3.1. LZ Topography. Do not rely on a single source of planning information. Compare all
         available current sources to obtain accurate terrain, obstruction, and location information for the
         target airfield and the approach, departure, and missed approach flight paths. LZ alignment is crit-
         ical. Compare multiple sources of LZ azimuth when defining the IP. NVG light pattern predic-
         tions are available from intelligence sources to assist in visual LZ recognition. Confirm LZ
         lighting and authentication with the user. Consider the threat and user requirements in determin-
         ing the onload/offload point and in developing the taxi and takeoff plan. Take into account differ-
         ences in geodetic spheroid and datum when comparing airfield coordinates from different sources.
         All of the following are excellent sources of airfield information:
            16.6.3.1.1. Large-scale topographic maps, including classified sources such as JOG-R and Air
            Targeting Charts.
            16.6.3.1.2. LZ surveys and safety-of-flight reviews from Special Tactics, AMC, or joint
            sources.
            16.6.3.1.3. Overhead photography, including Analytic Photogrammatic Positioning System
            (APPS) mosaics.
            16.6.3.1.4. NIMA FLIP airfield diagrams.
            16.6.3.1.5. HQ AMC ASRR.
            16.6.3.1.6. Airfield and Seaplane Stations of the World (ASSOTW). This is a classified doc-
            ument which is updated frequently and has exhaustive information on every LZ.
            16.6.3.1.7. DMAAC Air Facility Graphics (AFG). This is the Defense Mapping Agency's
            equivalent to the ASSOTW, but it is not as extensive.
         16.6.3.2. Use of Radar. Preplan use of the mapping radar to aid the approach in the event of inac-
         curate SCNS position. Consider the likelihood of seeing the LZ environment on radar. Small LZs
         may not have enough radar-significant buildup around them, and may necessitate selection of off-
         set radar targets. AN/APN-59/241 radar predictions are available from intelligence sources for the
         airfield and for en route targets.
         16.6.3.3. Order of Battle (OB) Analysis. The enemy OB (actual or simulated) is the most
         important factor in determining the route of flight to and from the LZ, including the location of the
         IP. Plan a minimum 7 NM straight-in approach unless prohibited by the OB. Analyze the planned
         ingress/egress route against the OB for all combat, contingency, and exercise missions. Auto-
         mated threat analysis tools such as IMOMS, CFPS/PFPS, Falconview, JUMPS, Tamps, and SOF-
         PARS should be used (if available) for OB analysis.
         16.6.3.4. General Planning Considerations:
            16.6.3.4.1. Confirm what type of altimeter setting will be used for the landing.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                           207


         16.6.3.4.2. Install IR lights and filters if required.
         16.6.3.4.3. Check for bleed through on the IR lights and covers prior to takeoff. Use the min-
         imum lighting required, even when using covert lights.
         16.6.3.4.4. Ensure both interior and exterior lights are correctly set and are as dim as possible
         commensurate with safety and visibility.
  16.6.4. Approach Path and Glideslope Construction. The product of the approach path and glides-
  lope construction is commonly referred to as a Self Contained Approach (SCA). Use touchdown zone
  elevation plus 300 feet for MDA and 1 NM prior to the touchdown zone for the MAP. Plan to inter-
  cept a 3 degree glideslope from en route altitude, unless terrain or obstructions dictate a different
  glideslope. Avoid using glideslopes greater than 5 degrees. Slowdown to threshold speed normally
  occurs at 5 NM prior to touchdown (approximately 3 NM prior to glide slope interception). Modify
  these criteria if required by the terrain, tactical situation, or aircraft configuration.
     16.6.4.1. Use all sources available to identify significant vertical obstructions within 3 NM of the
     LZ, the approach path, departure path, and go-around path. These are minimum distances and
     may need to be increased by the crew. In all cases, the course should give a minimum of 300 feet
     clearance from any obstruction. For each significant obstacle identified, plan and brief a specific
     means of avoidance during the approach. The following examples may be used singularly or in
     combination: use a steeper glideslope; if possible, move the touchdown point further down the
     runway or landing zone; a dog-leg to final may also be used, but the radius of turn must be planned
     to have the aircraft wings level on final at no less than 2 NM to touchdown.
     16.6.4.2. The navigator will construct an approach plate for the SCA using the AF Form 4118,
     SCA Planning Form, or an OGV approved planning form.
     16.6.4.3. The DR computer can be used to simplify approach plate construction. Once the
     planned glideslope has been determined, use the slide rule side to determine descent rate in feet/
     NM using the following formula:
        Glideslope              Feet/NM
          57.3         =          60
        Using this formula, a 3 degree glideslope equates to 315 feet/NM. This figure can now be
        converted to a VVI. Leaving the slide rule set up as it is (with feet/NM set over 60), look
        above the planned ground speed to find the planned VVI. Using the example of 315 feet/
        NM, a planned ground speed (after final slowdown) of 115 equates to a VVI of 600 feet/
        minute. The slide rule side can also be used to determine the planned start descent point.
        Since you already know how many feet/NM you need to lose (315 in this example), and you
        know the approach starts at 500 feet (or 300 feet), you can set up a proportion to find planned
        descent point:
        Feet/NM                   500
         1.0           =          Descent Point
        Using the example of 315 feet/NM, this proportion yields a descent point of 1.6 NM. Leav-
        ing the slide rule side set up as it is, you can also determine how many feet/NM you need to
        lose each 1/2 NM by looking above .5. In this case, the slide rule yields a value of 157 feet
        for every 1/2 NM. You now have all the information needed to construct an approach plate.
208                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


            Adding the values obtained for each 1/2 NM to the TDZE will yield the predicted MSL alti-
            tude at each 1/2 NM. To obtain the predicted AGL altitude, carefully analyze the terrain to
            compute actual terrain elevation below the aircraft. Subtract terrain elevation from the pre-
            dicted MSL altitude to obtain predicted AGL altitude at each 1/2 NM.
      16.6.5. Chart Preparation. Use the smallest scale chart available from 10 NM inbound. A 1:50,000
      chart is preferred, but in no case will it be larger than 1:500,000. The navigator should select update
      points for the AN/APN-59/241 radar, SCNS, and altimeter. Chart construction will be IAW this chap-
      ter and include the following additional items: the IP, slowdown points, descent point, and the missed
      approach, departure, and go around paths. Ensure update points for the SCNS, radar, and altimeter are
      annotated. The IP should be an easily identifiable point. If an identifiable point cannot be found on
      the extended centerline, it is advisable that equipment updates be made prior to the IP. It is of utmost
      importance to have sufficient, reliable update points prior to the IP and final run-in.
      16.6.6. Infil/Exfil Briefing. During the tactical mission briefing, in addition to items otherwise
      required, include the briefing items from the En route Checklist. It is not a requirement to run through
      the Infil/Exfil checklist prior to the flight, but it may help smooth out checklist use in-flight. Highlight
      key items during the actual En route Checklist.
      16.6.7. Approach Execution:
         16.6.7.1. General. Depending on aircraft configuration, the flight engineer or copilot will
         extend/turn on the IR or overt landing and taxi lights. If the pilot determines there is sufficient
         illumination, they can call for aircraft lights out. The navigator will make distance calls at every
         mile inside 10 miles and every half mile inside 3 miles (or as briefed). If the pilots don't have the
         landing zone environment in sight by the 1-mile call, they will execute a go around. Each pilot
         will silently ensure both NVG batteries are operational during the En route Checklist.
             16.6.7.1.1. NVG landings will only be conducted at military airfields or civilian fields carry-
             ing a letter of agreement on record with ACC.
         16.6.7.2. Inbound to the LZ. Fly an SCA. Maintain en route profile until descent for landing.
         Route study must be thorough with several visual update points committed to memory (like air-
         drop run-ins). Initiate the Slowdown/Before Landing Checklist at the point identified during mis-
         sion planning. Slow to threshold speed at this planned point. Ensure 100 percent flaps are set
         prior to reaching threshold speed. Complete the Slowdown/Before Landing Checklist. Once
         established on threshold speed, crosscheck drift and groundspeed to determine a predicted descent
         rate and to crosscheck crab.
         16.6.7.3. Setting Radar Altimeters. Radar altimeters should remain set at en route altitude set-
         ting until the slowdown. Once the slowdown is initiated, the radar altimeters may be reset as
         briefed. A 10 or 25 foot setting on the pilots radar altimeter helps judge the last few feet above the
         runway.
         16.6.7.4. Descent. Do not descend below 300 feet AGL until the LZ environment is identified
         visually and confirmed by both pilots. Whoever identifies the LZ first will call out "ZONE IN
         SIGHT", its clock position, and any discrepancies noted (i.e., any lights out, etc.). Both pilots will
         then confirm the zone and crosscheck the alignment for the proper heading.
         CAUTION: The IDS/FLIR (some airplanes) is helpful in LZ identification but it is not intended
         to be used for the purposes of flying the entire SCA.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                               209


       WARNING: Use of a 5 degree glideslope can cause descent rates in excess of 1000 feet per
       minute. Extreme care must be taken to break high descent rates with application of power prior to
       touchdown. In no case will a descent below 300 feet AGL be initiated prior to 2 NM to touch-
       down. This would cause the glideslope to be too shallow.
           16.6.7.4.1. At glideslope interception, the navigator will state "Begin Descent," and repeat the
           desired initial descent rate. The navigator will provide glidepath advisories with reference to
           the SCNS, the navigator's pressure altimeter, and the radar altimeter. These calls will be made
           at 1/2 nm intervals until reaching the "100 feet" call. State deviations in excess of 150 feet
           explicitly. The navigator also advises the pilot if the aircraft is correcting to or diverging from
           glidepath, using the term "Rapidly," if appropriate. As a guide, the following criteria may be
           used for glideslope deviation calls:
               Slightly above or below ..........50 feet
               Above or below.....................100 feet
               Well above or below .............150 feet
           16.6.7.4.2. The flight engineer or navigator, as designated by the aircraft commander, will call
           100, 50, 25 and 10 feet above touchdown.
       16.6.7.5. The On The Runway Checklist is automatically initiated when the pilot clears the ramp
       and door. Complete the On The Runway Checklist and takeoff, if in position. Complete a normal
       takeoff or a maximum effort takeoff as required. Initiate the After Takeoff Checklist with the gear
       up call.

NOTE:
During the initial Infil/Exfil brief, the pilot may prebrief the opening of the ramp and door upon reversing
of the engines. Opening of the ramp and door initiates the On The Runway Checklist.
       16.6.7.6. Go-Around and Departure Procedures. When executing a go-around or departure,
       the flight engineer or navigator as designated by the aircraft commander, will call out passing 100,
       200, and 300 feet AGL. Whether maneuvering for another approach or proceeding with the route,
       plan to fly no lower than 500 feet AGL unless operational requirements dictate other altitudes.
       During a go-around initiate the Go Around Checklist.
       CAUTION: Pilots are more susceptible to spatial disorientation during NVG go-arounds and
       departures.
           16.6.7.6.1. If attempting an immediate visual approach and landing (closed pattern), exercise
           caution in clearing for obstacles. Maneuver the aircraft to be 500 feet AGL wings level and
           configured at approximately a 2 NM final. Care must be taken to keep the landing zone in
           sight during this maneuver. As an aid, have the navigator mark the position over the approach
           end of the runway while executing the go-around. With an immediate landing feasible you
           may go to step 2 of the Slowdown/Before Landing Checklist or go to the Option Before Land-
           ing Checklist.
           16.6.7.6.2. If an immediate approach and landing are not feasible, maneuver the aircraft to the
           IP or next waypoint at a minimum of 300/500 feet AGL as appropriate and request or continue
210                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


             with the alternate plan. With an immediate landing not feasible, execute the After Takeoff
             Checklist.
         16.6.7.7. Loss of NVGs:
             16.6.7.7.1. Airborne. If the pilot or copilot lose use of their NVGs inside of 2 NM, perform
             a go-around.
                 16.6.7.7.1.1. If the flight engineer loses use of NVGs, land at the discretion of the Aircraft
                 Commander. The other crewmembers must increase their clearing duties and confirm the
                 zone.
                 16.6.7.7.1.2. After takeoff, continue the climbout and follow the appropriate procedures
                 for loss of NVGs.
             16.6.7.7.2. On the Ground. The pilot will determine whether to continue the landing rollout
             or takeoff roll as applicable. The copilot should be prepared to turn on overt lighting at the
             direction of the aircraft commander in case of NVG failure during takeoff or landing roll.
      16.6.8. Overt Landings Following NVG Landings. If the sortie will continue with Non-NVG VFR
      traffic patterns, the Post Low Level and the On the Runway Touch and Go Checklist OR the Infil/
      Exfil Option Landing Checklist will be accomplished. If only a few patterns are planned, the Infil/
      Exfil Option Landing Checklist is quicker and easier to use. If many patterns or instrument work is
      planned, the Post Low Level and On the Runway Touch and Go Checklist is appropriate.
      WARNING: If utilizing the Infil/Exfil Option Landing Checklist, insure you untape (non-NVIS
      lighting-equipped aircraft) the appropriate warning lights IAW the expanded checklist so that they are
      visible when unaided.
      16.6.9. Infil/Exfil Option Landing Procedures. For stop and go landings, runway remaining for
      takeoff must be sufficient to allow takeoff and refusal speeds to be equal. The minimum runway
      length for a touch and go is 7000 feet. Do not perform ground idle touch and go's. Fly the pattern to
      be wings level on 2 mile final. Pilots will call the zone in sight as they turn final and nav/engineer will
      make standard altitude advisory calls on descent. For further, guidance see Chapter 2 of the flight
      manual.

Section 16B—Rescue HC/MC-130 Airdrop Procedures

16.7. Airdrop Preparation:
      16.7.1. General. This chapter describes Rescue HC/MC-130 weapon system employment during
      airdrop. Tactical forces are employed to deliver and recover personnel, equipment, and supplies to,
      within, and from combat areas, at all levels of conflict, throughout a wide spectrum of climate, terrain,
      and conditions of combat, as far forward in the combat zone as requirements demand.
      16.7.2. Depending on threat environment, there are generally two airdrop methods used; i.e., tactical
      airdrop and rescue procedures.
         16.7.2.1. Permissive Environment. The situation will usually allow multiple passes and a drop
         into the wind. The ability to deliver survival gear, medical personnel, or supplies to a mishap site
         is important. In this instance, a jumpmaster pararescue/equipment deployment or rescue equip-
         ment kit deliveries could be used.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                          211


         16.7.2.1.1. The effect of the wind on the pattern to be flown and the trajectory of parachuted
         items must be considered. Some items may be dropped free-fall with negligible wind effect.
         The best results will be obtained when dropping items on "into the wind" headings. Turbu-
         lence is usually encountered at low altitudes and in the vicinity of mountains. All items
         dropped from an aircraft represent a hazard to personnel on the surface; therefore, drops
         should be made close enough for retreival, yet pose no threat to personnel.
         16.7.2.1.2. The landing point of spotter chutes/streamers, cargo bundles, and/or jumpers will
         be identified using clock positions and distances relative to the final approach flown.
         16.7.2.1.3. The aircraft commander is the final authority to determine the appropriate method/
         resources to accomplish a rescue mission.
     16.7.2.2. Contested Environment. In a tactical situation where the hostile threat is unknown or
     determined to be a factor, low observability is a requirement. A single pass over the objective,
     with minimum time spent in the drop area at altitude and at a slower airdrop airspeeds, will reduce
     vulnerability. Navigator-directed tactical airdrops using CARP/HARP procedures will be used in
     these environments.
         16.7.2.2.1. The purpose of a single pass tactical airdrop is to deploy personnel or equipment in
         support of combat operations and to aid recovery or resupply of personnel in a hostile environ-
         ment. The procedure is normally executed at the end of a low-level ingress route.
     16.7.2.3. Regardless of the type drop used, primary and alternate frequencies, schedules, and an
     alternate method of communication will be established prior to PJ deployment.
  16.7.3. Intelligence. Employment in contested environments depends on accurate intelligence.
  Detailed information on threats in the area must be available. The precise location of the target or
  drop zone (DZ) must be known.
  16.7.4. Airdrop Restrictions:
     16.7.4.1. Airdrops will be conducted in day or night VMC. (EXCEPTION: Ground Radar
     Aerial Delivery System and aircrews with AN/APN-241 radar equipped units who have com-
     pleted the C-130 ATS AWADS certification).
     16.7.4.2. Airdrops will be conducted with a minimum of 1 minute separation.
     16.7.4.3. Minimum en route flight time from takeoff to time over release point, for drops, will be
     sufficient to safely accomplish all required checklists. For airdrops involving personnel, en route
     time of less than 25 minutes must be approved by the jumpmaster.
     16.7.4.4. Crews will not make airdrops using parachutes for which AFI 11-231 does not list bal-
     listics, unless the ballistics or K-factor have been approved by ASD/ENECA Natick and MAJ-
     COM/DOT.
     16.7.4.5. All aircraft will have an operative INS, DVS, or GPS for airdrop operations. This
     restriction does not prohibit using winds obtained visually or from alternate methods to assist in
     the airdrop computation.
     16.7.4.6. Ramp and Door Operations:
         16.7.4.6.1. If an air deflector door cannot be opened, its respective paratroop door will not be
         used.
212                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


             16.7.4.6.2. SCNS Airdrop/Troop Jump Computer-Manual Select Switch must be set to AD/
             TJ manual.
             16.7.4.6.3. A maximum of ten static lines may be retrieved manually per paratroop door. A
             maximum of 20 static lines per cable may be retrieved with a static line retriever winch.
             16.7.4.6.4. Do not open a paratroop door and the cargo ramp and door at the same time.
             16.7.4.6.5. See AFI 11-231 for airdrop altitudes, airspeeds, and winds.
      16.7.5. Identification of Airdrop Items. Immediate identification of aerial delivery containers that
      land off the drop zone in unsecured areas may be necessary. The following procedures will aid in
      denying the enemy usable items and in minimizing the risk of loss of life over items that may be
      expendable. Aircraft commanders will be familiar with airdrop container contents and the order in
      which it leaves the aircraft for radio transmission to the designated ground customer, if requested.
      Identify supplies or equipment by either the class numbering system or internationally recognized
      color coding system as follows:
         16.7.5.1. Class I - Subsistence.
         16.7.5.2. Class II - Individual equipment.
         16.7.5.3. Class III - POL.
         16.7.5.4. Class IV - Construction materials.

         16.7.5.10. Class X - Non-military programs (i.e. agricultural supplies).
      16.7.6. Airdrop Kits. The loadmaster will ensure enough equipment is included to satisfy load or
      mission requirements. Minimum contents or airdrop kits will include cloth-backed pressure sensitive
      tape, masking tape, 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord, 550 cord, 5 cord, 80-pound cotton webbing, 54"
      extension, two G-14 clevises, adjustable wrench, and two anchor cable stops.
      16.7.7. Joint Airdrop Inspection Records. DD Form 1748, Joint Airdrop Inspection Record, will
      be accomplished prior to all equipment airdrops. Completion, retention, and disposition of the form
      will be in accordance with AFJI 13-210, as supplemented. EXCEPTION: A-7A and A-21 contain-
      ers rigged as door bundles.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            213


NOTE:
Equipment not rigged IAW 13C-series T.O.s, Army Field Manuals, or Joint Special Operations Command
(JSOC) 350-series manuals requires a waiver from HQ ACC/DOT. EXCEPTION: Waivers are not
required for resupply, parabundles, and equipment described in this volume.
   16.7.8. Verification of Load Information. The navigator will verify the actual number and type of
   parachutes, load weights, sequence of delivery, and position of loads in the aircraft agree with planned
   CARP data. Recalculate CARPs when required. If an individual load has a different type or number
   of parachutes from other loads, compute a CARP for each load to ensure all loads will land on the DZ.
   Base drop altitude on the item requiring the highest drop altitude.
   16.7.9. Marking Airdrop Loads. The navigator will mark call sign and date on all equipment, con-
   tainers, and standard airdrop training bundles (SATBs). Mark equipment loads by order of exit if
   more than one load is dropped on the same pass.
   16.7.10. Types of Drop Zones. Refer to AFI 13-217.
   16.7.11. Drop Zone Survey Procedures. Refer to AFI 13-217.
   16.7.12. Drop Zone Markings. In addition to AFI 13-217, the following applies:
       16.7.12.1. Red Smoke, Flare, or Light. Normally, red smoke, flares, or lights on the DZ indicate
       a "no drop."
       16.7.12.2. Signals Other Than Red. Normally, precoordinated smoke, flares, or lights other
       than red on the DZ indicate clearance to drop.
       16.7.12.3. Emergency Signals:
           16.7.12.3.1. Day. During daylight VMC, an emergency "no drop" or drop cancellation may
           be indicated by red smoke, flares, or lights, or by forming the identifier into the letter "X."
           16.7.12.3.2. Night. A "no drop" condition is indicated by a red flare. During unilateral train-
           ing missions the absence of the prebriefed DZ markings indicates a "no drop" situation.

NOTE:
During combat, it may be impractical for ground forces to mark the DZ as indicated in 16.7.12.3. In such
cases, the airdrop can be made on the prebriefed coordinates, over the briefed area, or in an area marked
by a FAC.
   16.7.13. Minimum Size Drop Zones. See AFI 13-217.
   16.7.14. Airdrop Weather Minimums and Wind Limitations. See AFI 13-217.

16.8. Airdrop Flight Procedures:
   16.8.1. Safety Devices. Crew loadmasters will wear a restraint harness/parachute, headgear, and eye
   protection when performing duties near an open exit in flight. Helmet and eye protection will be worn
   IAW Chapter 6. Fit the restraint harness and adjust the lifeline prior to flight.
       16.8.1.1. Connect the hook to a point that will preclude the wearer from exiting the aircraft. The
       strap will not be connected to an anchor cable that has static lines for an airdrop attached to it.
214                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         16.8.1.2. Restraint harness lifelines may be attached to an unused anchor cable provided no static
         lines are attached and an anchor cable stop is positioned at FS 737, and taped.
         16.8.1.3. Disconnect the hook, roll and secure the lifeline to the restraint harness after the lifeline
         has been adjusted.
         16.8.1.4. Connect the lifeline when at or anticipating movement aft of FS 677.
         16.8.1.5. The on board Army safety personnel will normally provide his own parachute. Alter-
         nately, at their discretion, they may use a restraint harness. Other personnel required to be mobile
         in the cargo compartment, as determined by the mission commander, will be provided a restraint
         harness. EXCEPTION: Flight examiner loadmasters are exempted from this requirement pro-
         vided they are not performing primary or backup loadmaster duties and will not be positioned aft
         of FS 677. If either of these conditions are not met, a restraint harness is required.

NOTE:
Do not use the flight deck restraint harness for airdrops.
         16.8.1.6. For actual combat missions, wear a restraint harness for drops below 1000 feet AGL.
         For drops at or above 1000 feet AGL, wear a parachute.
      16.8.2. Checklists. Amplified checklists that apply to specific airdrop employment procedures are
      included as Attachment 2. Abbreviated checklists are AFI 11-2HC-130V3, CL-1 and CL-2. Check-
      lists may be compressed or completed early if mission requirements dictate. Normally, all items of the
      preceding checklist are to be accomplished prior to initiating the next checklist. Avoid the use of the
      word "GREEN" or "LIGHT" after initiation of the slowdown checklist until arriving at the release
      point.
      16.8.3. Airdrop Communications Procedures. To the maximum extent possible, airdrop opera-
      tions should be performed with minimum radio transmissions. In general, airborne assault or tactical
      resupply missions are flown as planned, with radio calls made by "exception" only. Radio transmis-
      sions with the DZ are limited to those required for safety of flight considerations or factors affecting
      airborne force employment. This includes ATC directions, range clearance, unsafe surface condi-
      tions, or mission changes. DZ wind information will be broadcast in the blind at a precoordinated
      time prior to the scheduled TOT. When the tactical situation warrants total radio silence, transmission
      of wind information, range clearance, and artillery advisories is not required.
         16.8.3.1. Drop Clearance is Normally Inherent with Mission Clearance. Drop clearance in
         VMC is confirmed by the aircrew observing the proper authentication; that is, the prebriefed drop
         zone identifier, markings, or correctly colored smoke or flare.
         16.8.3.2. No Drop or Mission Cancellation. In VFR conditions, a no drop or mission cancella-
         tion is communicated by the absence of prebriefed markings (visual and electronic), observation
         of the block letter X, or red smoke or flare.
         16.8.3.3. Authentication. To preclude enemy radio intrusion, only changes to planned mission
         profiles are transmitted and authenticated. Incorrect authentication invalidates the radio transmis-
         sion.
      16.8.4. Navigating to the Release Point:
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             215


     16.8.4.1. Planning. Use the best available large scale charts, JOGs, DZ survey, and photos for
     DZ and run-in study. Beginning with the DZ, memorize PI location, DZ dimensions, 5 second
     warning, and prominent DZ features. Run-in study should begin with a prominent, easily identi-
     fied initial point (IP). Attempt to minimize large turns at the IP. If large turns cannot be avoided,
     figure the radius of turn for run-in from IP to DZ. Plan at least two (preferably three) update
     points for the run-in to ensure proper DZ alignment. The navigator performing the airdrop will
     prepare an AF Form 4123, Airdrop Card, or OGV-approved equivalent, for each type drop
     planned.
     16.8.4.2. Positioning. Accurately positioning the aircraft at the release point is the most critical
     phase of the airdrop mission. Crew coordination is crucial to ensure that all warnings and check-
     lists are completed, proper DZ line-up is maintained, and time over target (TOT) is within estab-
     lished tolerances.
     16.8.4.3. Pilot and Navigator Release Point Procedures. To position the aircraft accurately at
     the release point, use the following pilot/navigator procedures:
        16.8.4.3.1. Airspeed adjustments should be completed prior to the IP (normally located 10-15
        NM prior to DZ) or slowdown, whichever occurs first.
        16.8.4.3.2. If the IP is visible from a distance and time control permits, overfly the IP on
        run-in heading. Otherwise, fly a radius of turn leg to the DZ. If required, update navigation
        equipment at the IP.
        16.8.4.3.3. After departing the IP, the pilot not flying the aircraft assists the navigator in main-
        taining the desired track inbound by confirming aircraft position with the planned run-in
        update points.
        16.8.4.3.4. The navigator provides headings that will position the aircraft the required dis-
        tance upwind from centerline track so that large corrections will not be required on the final
        approach to the release point.
        16.8.4.3.5. At slowdown, immediately double the drift used prior to slowdown and apply it to
        the run-in heading. This will keep the aircraft on the upwind side of the PI.
        16.8.4.3.6. The navigator informs the pilot of the expected drift, the heading required to par-
        allel the DZ axis, and confirms the drop altitude and airspeed.
        16.8.4.3.7. As soon as the DZ is visible and identified by the pilot and navigator, they jointly
        confirm the release point location, lateral offset, and track required. The pilot then assumes
        the responsibility for maintaining this offset distance and required track. The navigator will
        pick the timing point, if required, and control the time of "green light" and "red light," and con-
        tinually cross check the offset distance.
        16.8.4.3.8. During the final seconds of the approach to the release point, the pilot not flying
        the aircraft places a hand near the jump light switch. Five seconds prior to release, the naviga-
        tor will give a preparatory call of "5 seconds." At this call, if the aircraft location is not within
        precoordinated parameters, a "no drop" condition exists.
        16.8.4.3.9. At the release point:
            16.8.4.3.9.1. The navigator will state "green light."
216                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


                 16.8.4.3.9.2. The pilot not flying the aircraft will turn on the green light and verbally calls
                 the light "on."
             16.8.4.3.10. During the drop:
                 16.8.4.3.10.1. The loadmaster will not deploy equipment or personnel until hearing and
                 seeing the green light. (EXCEPTION: During manual parachute flare, streamer, marker
                 smoke, or sea-dye delivery and for rescue airdrops using the Search and Rescue Checklist,
                 the loadmaster may deploy equipment on the pilot's verbal command.)
                 16.8.4.3.10.2. The pilot will make any small corrections required to maintain the track.
                 16.8.4.3.10.3. The navigator will monitor the time to "red light."
                 16.8.4.3.10.4. The loadmaster will advise the pilot when the load is clear and of any delay
                 or malfunction.
      16.8.5. Ramp and Door Operations. Depending on the tactical situation, it may be desirable to
      open the ramp and door prior to slowdown. The pilot may direct ramp and door opening anytime after
      the Six-Minute Advisory has been completed and 180 KIAS has been achieved. After the ramp and
      door are open, loadmasters are cleared to complete their slowdown checks.
      16.8.6. Slowdown Procedures. During airdrop operations, the pilot will perform the slowdown
      maneuver and accomplish the slowdown checklist at a predetermined point prior to the release point.
      The preselected slowdown point will be an easily identifiable geographical point at or prior to the dis-
      tance specified for the slowdown. A computer position or prebriefed timing procedure may be used
      when a geographical point is not available. Begin slowdown at a distance commensurate with profi-
      ciency of crew. Decrease slowdown distance as proficiency increases (approximately 5 NM for 240
      KIAS, no wind). The objective is to reduce the time the aircraft is vulnerable at drop altitude and air-
      speed. After the navigator calls for the slowdown:
         16.8.6.1. The loadmaster completes both the Slowdown Checklist and One-Minute Warning
         Checklist (except for Leaflet drops).
         16.8.6.2. The pilot retards the throttles to flight idle (0-1000 inch pounds of torque).
         16.8.6.3. The copilot lowers the flaps in 10 percent increments on speed.
         16.8.6.4. The copilot opens the air deflector doors (if required) upon slowing below 150 KIAS.
         For tailgate drops, the flight engineer calls "doors" as part of the checklist, the loadmaster fol-
         lowed by the pilot state "clear to open", and the flight engineer opens the cargo door and ramp.
         For paratroop door drops, once air deflector doors are called open, this automatically clears the
         loadmaster to open the paratroop doors. (EXCEPTION: During manual parachute flare,
         streamer, marker smoke, or sea-dye delivery, and rescue airdrops using the Search/Deployment
         Checklist from the ramp and door, the loadmaster will open and close the cargo ramp.)
         16.8.6.5. For CDS drops, reset the flaps IAW the CDS flap setting chart in the abbreviated check-
         list only.
         16.8.6.6. The aircraft must be level at drop altitude and airspeed by green light time. EXCEP-
         TION: During personnel airdrops, the aircraft must be at or above drop altitude and stable not
         later than 1 minute out (2 minutes out for jumpmaster directed drops) to allow the jumpmaster
         access to the paratroop door.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            217


      WARNING: For personnel airdrops, the pilot must be aware of paratroopers standing in the back
      and avoid drastic pitch or bank changes after the Six Minute Advisory.
      16.8.6.7. Complete the Slowdown and One Minute Warning Checklists.
      16.8.6.8. Complete the aerial delivery.
   16.8.7. Aircrew No Drop Decisions:
      16.8.7.1. Prior to the "1-minute" call, any crewmember who determines a condition exists that
      could jeopardize a safe drop will notify the aircraft commander. A "no drop" will be called at the
      discretion of the aircraft commander.
      16.8.7.2. After the "1-minute" call, any crewmember observing a condition that would jeopardize
      a safe drop will transmit "no drop" on interphone. The copilot and loadmaster will immediately
      acknowledge the "no drop" call. The loadmaster will accomplish the applicable no-drop proce-
      dures before performing the Completion of Drop Checklist. The aircraft commander must ensure
      the crew is aware of what the plan is in the event of a no drop (racetrack, alternate DZ, RTB, etc.)
      and instruct the crew to follow the appropriate procedures.
      16.8.7.3. Checklist may still be in progress after the "ONE MINUTE ADVISORY." Call "no
      drop" if all checklists are not completed by the "5 Second" call.
      16.8.7.4. If a "no drop" is called after load restraint is removed and a racetrack is not planned,
      restraint will be reapplied.
   16.8.8. Departure From Drop Zone (Escape). The navigator will call "red light" at the expiration
   of the "green light" time or upon hearing the loadmaster's call of "load clear," whichever occurs first.
   When the red light is turned on, immediately begin the escape maneuver by tracking flaps if required,
   turning to the departure heading, increase airspeed to 140 KIAS, and attain en route altitude. To facil-
   itate static line retrieval and preclude entanglement, do not exceed 140 KIAS until the static lines are
   retrieved. During combat, static lines that cannot be retrieved will be cut so that doors can be closed.
   Close all doors, raise flaps, and accelerate to en route airspeed. It is imperative that the aircraft be
   configured for high speed evasive maneuvers. Therefore, after the static lines have been retrieved or
   cut, the doors and air deflectors closed, and flaps raised, the remainder of the Completion of Drop
   checklist may be deferred to a more convenient time while returning to the recovery base.
   16.8.9. Multiple Passes (Racetrack). Multiple passes will not be made unless directed or previously
   agreed upon by all units involved. If multiple passes are flown, all airdrop checklists will be accom-
   plished. Checklists may be compressed during racetracks, but the aircraft commander must ensure the
   loadmaster has adequate time to complete all items before the drop is initiated. The One Minute
   Warning is never compressed and is always given on time. (EXCEPTION: During pilot directed air-
   drops, the checklist may be initiated at a point commensurate with the available time and type of drop.
   Doors may remain open at the discretion of the aircraft commander.)

16.9. Low Altitude Airdrop Positioning:
   16.9.1. General. This section describes methods of positioning the aircraft on a final for low level
   visual and non-visual airdrops.
   16.9.2. Computed Air Release Point (CARP) Aerial Delivery:
218                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         16.9.2.1. General. The computed air release point (CARP) is a mathematical computation based
         on average parachute ballistics and dead reckoning principles. After computing the CARP solu-
         tion, the navigator plots it on an appropriately scaled chart, sketch, diagram, or aerial photograph.
         Detailed instructions for CARP computations and depictions are contained in AFI 11-231.
         16.9.2.2. Positioning Error. Accurate visual positioning of the aircraft over the release point is
         the major difficulty of the CARP system. Make corrections to the aircraft track as far out from the
         CARP as possible to minimize this deficiency. To achieve desired drop accuracy, maintain the
         track during the final approach to the CARP and throughout the drop (green light) time.
      16.9.3. (Visual) Ground Marked Release System (GMRS). Airdrops may be made using the
      visual ground marked release system (GMRS). In this system, supported ground forces are responsi-
      ble for computing a release point and providing ground markings (panels or lights). The airdrop will
      be made directly over this marker or abeam a flank marker as determined during joint planning. Air-
      crew procedures are the same as those employed during a standard drop except that a pilot may
      assume the responsibility for calling "5 seconds" and "green light." The navigator will compute an
      in-flight CARP to predict the approximate location of the release point and facilitate initial line-up
      during the run-in to the DZ. See AFI 13-217 for markings.
         16.9.3.1. The inverted "L" uses a standard four-marker pattern placed 100 meters to the left of the
         desired release point. The corner marker panel (release point marker) may be used to identify the
         ground party through the use of a code light or special panel signal. Execute the drop when the
         aircraft arrives directly opposite and 100 meters to the right of the corner marker panel on the pre-
         briefed inbound heading.
         16.9.3.2. The special operations inverted "L" is a three light variation of the standard four-marker
         pattern. The release point for the special operations inverted "L" is only 50 meters to the right of
         the lights.
         16.9.3.3. The "T" utilizes six markers instead of four in the inverted "L."

NOTE:
Navigators will not deduct AFI 11-231 safety zone distance when computing the usable drop zone length
for Special Forces GMRS drops. The safety zone consideration has already been compensated for. Dur-
ing GMRS airdrops, the parent service of the supported ground forces accepts responsibility for the point
of impact for the airdrop.
      16.9.4. Verbally Initiated Release System (VIRS). VIRS is an airdrop method by which ground
      personnel provide verbal steering guidance to an aircraft and call the release when the aircraft arrives
      over a predetermined point on the ground. VIRS will only be performed by qualified CCT, TALO,
      DZCO, pararescue, or other properly trained personnel.
         16.9.4.1. This option may be selected under the following conditions:
             16.9.4.1.1. CARP procedures cannot be used.
             16.9.4.1.2. The DZ release point is located in an area where the normal GMRS markings
             would not be visible from the aircraft.
             16.9.4.1.3. It is tactically impractical to mark the DZ.
         16.9.4.2. When this option is selected:
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             219


         16.9.4.2.1. The ground party will compute the release point.
         16.9.4.2.2. The ground party will position on the intended release point, provide the aircrew
         with verbal steering guidance and call the release when the aircraft reaches the release point.
         16.9.4.2.3. The ground party should use the following terminology:
             16.9.4.2.3.1. "Turn left or right"--directs approximately a half standard rate turn unless
             specified otherwise.
             16.9.4.2.3.2. "Stop turn"--self-explanatory.
             16.9.4.2.3.3. "Standby"--indicates approximately five seconds prior to the release point.
             16.9.4.2.3.4. "Execute, execute, execute"--directs release of the load.
         16.9.4.2.4. Upon hearing the term "standby", the navigator will state "5 seconds" on the inter-
         phone. On the first "execute," the navigator will state "green light."
         16.9.4.2.5. The authentication procedures to be employed will be briefed prior to the mission.
         The procedure should be as simple and short as possible so as not to interfere with the
         approach to the DZ. Based on the limitations of radio equipment and terrain, a point will be
         identified as far out on the approach as possible where contact should be first attempted for
         authentication.
         16.9.4.2.6. The ground party must maintain positive visual contact with the aircraft at all
         times during the inbound approach. If, in a training situation, doubt exists that the airdrop can
         be safely executed, or if the DZ cannot be positively identified by the aircrew, a no drop will
         be called by either the ground party or the aircrew. In a combat situation, the ground party will
         direct the aircraft to the release point and call the release. In this situation, the lack of visual
         acquisition of the DZ by the aircrew will not, by itself, constitute grounds for calling a no drop.
         During VIRS airdrops, the ground party providing the verbal steers accepts responsibility for
         the point of impact of the airdrop.
  16.9.5. Ground Radar Aerial Delivery System (GRADS). GRADS is an airdrop method using
  fixed radar facilities to provide navigational guidance and positioning of the aircraft over the desired
  release point. Precision instrument flying, standard airdrop procedures, and proper pilot response to
  the radar controller's instructions are primary aircrew considerations for this type of aerial delivery.
  CAUTION: Airdrops in heavy precipitation are not recommended.
     16.9.5.1. Navigational Equipment. Aircraft radar, SCNS, TACAN, and airborne radar transpon-
     der beacon should be operational.
     16.9.5.2. Drop Altitude. Drop altitude is based on the type parachute used, type of drop system
     employed, terrain features, and enemy threat.
     16.9.5.3. Procedures. All voice procedures are the same as those used for GCI or GCA. When
     within range, contact ground radar giving heading, altitude, and ETA to the pre-IP (PIP). Turn the
     radar transponder beacon on when directed.
         16.9.5.3.1. Inbound to the IP, the navigator will compute a release point based on latest wind
         data. Report release point data in true bearing and distance in yards or as required from the
         point of impact to the ground controller.
220                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


             16.9.5.3.2. The ground controller will provide the following information on aircraft position:
             PIP, IP, 6 minutes out, 2 minutes out, 1 minute out, 30 seconds out, countdown from 5 seconds,
             and "MARK" when over release point. Upon hearing "MARK," the navigator will state
             "green light."
             16.9.5.3.3. Standard drop procedures and checklists are utilized.
             16.9.5.3.4. If voice contact is lost or cannot be established, the pilot will immediately execute
             the prebriefed lost communications procedures. If within a corridor and operating at a safe
             altitude, the pilot may continue on the briefed route and attempt to reestablish communica-
             tions.
      16.9.6. Jumpmaster Directed (JMD) Airdrops. JMD airdrops from ACC Rescue HC/MC-130 air-
      craft require Group CC approval. (EXCEPTION: Unilateral PJ airdrops for continuation training.)
      Qualified jumpmasters (or trainees under supervision of instructor) may direct the aircraft to a release
      point and determine the exit point in accordance with the following restrictions and procedures:
         16.9.6.1. Airdrop personnel in VMC, single ship below 5,000 feet AGL only.
         16.9.6.2. Personnel will not exit the aircraft unless the green light is illuminated.
         16.9.6.3. The navigators will calculate a CARP or HARP for each drop. The aircrew and the
         jumpmaster will compare predicted release points, resolve any significant differences, and agree
         to a planned slowdown point or time. Navigators will update the jumpmaster in-flight on actual
         wind information and any changes to the crew's preflight computed RP location.
         16.9.6.4. In-flight visual signals, verbal signals, and interphone procedures between the jump-
         master, loadmaster, and pilot will be coordinated prior to takeoff.
         16.9.6.5. Standard Voice Terminology. When the jumpmaster provides assistance on final
         approach, use the following standard voice terminology:
             16.9.6.5.1. "Steady" (present course is satisfactory).
             16.9.6.5.2. "Right" (change direction to the right 5 degrees).
             16.9.6.5.3. "Left" (change direction to the left 5 degrees).
             16.9.6.5.4. "Right or left __ degrees" (change direction as indicated). This direction will be
             utilized when directional changes in excess of 5 degrees are desired.
             16.9.6.5.5. "No-drop" (no-drop will be called for unsafe or unknown conditions or unsatis-
             factory positioning over the target).
             16.9.6.5.6. "Load Clear" (jumpers or cargo bundles have cleared the aircraft and the pilot is
             clear to make a turn to begin the next pass and/or observe results of the drop just accom-
             plished).
             16.9.6.5.7. The jumpmaster may use the following hand signals to relay course corrections
             through the safety man: Thumb left/right, indicating 5-degree correction; and palm open, fin-
             gers pointed toward the cockpit, indicating steady.
         16.9.6.6. After Search and Rescue Airdrop Checklists, Pre-Deployment checks are complete, and
         no less than 2 minutes out from the release point, the loadmaster will allow the jumpmaster access
         to the door to begin the "spotting procedures." The jumpmaster visually relays steering signals to
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            221


     the loadmaster, who verbally relays this information to the pilot. The jumpmaster may spot from
     the aircraft ramp or a paratroop door; however, the aircraft ramp and paratroop doors will not be
     opened simultaneously.
     16.9.6.7. The aircrew may turn on the "green light" once the drop zone has been positively iden-
     tified, but no earlier than 1 minute prior to the navigators release point for freefall operations, or
     30 seconds for static line operations. If at at any time exit of jumpers becomes unsafe (aircraft
     emergency or similar circumstances), the aircrew will turn on the red light and the loadmaster will
     direct the jumpmaster to stop remaining parachutists.
     16.9.6.8. During JMD airdrops, the jumpmaster's parent unit accepts responsibility for jump
     results and personnel injury. The jumpmaster determines the release point (RP) mathematically
     (D=KAV) or by wind drift indicator.
     16.9.6.9. JMD releases will not be mixed with any other type of airdrop method (e.g., GMRS,
     VIRS) or standard CARP/HARP drops. When JMD drop procedures are used, the crew will fol-
     low the jumpmaster's instructions, while adhering to normal safety concerns. If the crew believes
     the drop will occur outside of safe parameters, they will call "NO-DROP" and ensure the red light
     is illuminated.
     16.9.6.10. Circular/Random Approach DZs. A circular DZ has multiple run-in headings. The
     size of the DZ will be governed by mission requirements and usable terrain. VIRS may be utilized
     with no markings.
  16.9.7. Water DZs. Water drops can be conducted on marked or unmarked DZs.
     16.9.7.1. Marked DZs will have a specific pattern marking either the release point or the PI.
     VIRS, CARP, or GMRS may be used as the drop procedure. For GMRS, the position of the recov-
     ery/safety boat usually marks the intended release point. Other options include three or more
     boats in formation to form an inverted "L," or floating smoke pot to indicate PI.
         16.9.7.1.1. Day markings to identify the safety or recovery boat can include, but are not lim-
         ited to: signal mirrors, VS-17 panels, or smoke.
         16.9.7.1.2. Night markings to identify the safety or recovery boat can include, but are not lim-
         ited to: colored lights (green on the bow, red on the stern and bow into the wind), rotating bea-
         con, B-2 light gun, or strobe light (white or IR).
         16.9.7.1.3. Electronic markings to identify the recovery or safety boat can include, but are not
         limited to, direction finding (DF) radio steer and radar beacons (SST-181).
     16.9.7.2. Unmarked DZs will have pre-surveyed PIs. Coordinates of the PI will be included in
     the aircrew, reception committee and jumper briefings.
     16.9.7.3. The essential element in DZ marking, no matter what markings are used, is for all par-
     ticipants (aircrew, reception committee, and jumpers) to know exactly what will be used, to
     include no drop signals.
  16.9.8. USAF Pararescue Deployment. Rescue HC/MC-130 aircrews performing jumpmaster
  directed pararescue drops will comply with the guidance in paragraphs 16.9.6., 16.9.7., and the fol-
  lowing:
222                                        AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


      16.9.8.1. Pre-Deployment Evaluation. In a permissive environment, evaluation of the landing
      surface and surrounding obstructions should be accomplished by observation passes. Evaluation
      of the weather should include existing and forecast temperatures, wind direction, precipitation,
      cloud cover, fog, visibility, etc. Wind velocity evaluation will include consideration of direction,
      gusts, and wind shear. The crew should keep the jumpmaster advised of current mean altitude
      winds. The presence of rocks or stumps may impose a lower maximum velocity while the pres-
      ence of trees, unfrozen tundra, or soft snow might permit safe jumping at higher velocities.
      16.9.8.2. Jumpmaster-Directed Pararescue Deployment. Pararescuemen wearing static line
      parachutes will normally deploy through a single paratroop door or the cargo ramp (tailgate). The
      parachute static line hookup will be to either anchor cable for paratroop door drops and to the left
      side anchor cable for tailgate drops. No more than 20 may exit on a single pass using the long
      cable either from the paratroop door or off the ramp. Streamer/spotter chutes will be used prior to
      JMD PJ deployments.
         16.9.8.2.1. Streamers are 20-foot lengths of crepe paper weighted on one end. The spotter
         chute used is the standard J-1 (12 foot diameter) wind drift determination parachute. The spot-
         ter chute weight can be the one provided by the PJ or a MK-6 Mod 3 smoke. When the MK-6
         Mod 3 is used, the jumpmaster will signal the safetyman/loadmaster when to launch the
         smoke. Immediately upon receiving the signal, the safetyman/loadmaster will simultaneously
         activate and launch the smoke.
         16.9.8.2.2. The safetyman/loadmaster will assist the jumpmaster in launching the streamer/
         spotter chute and will remain at the door during PJ deployments. Fow low altitude JMD PJ
         drops, a navigator's CARP is not required when using streamers/spotter chutes. The jumpmas-
         ter, pilot, and navigator will confirm the exit point prior to release.
         16.9.8.2.3. Pararescuemen will run the Safetyman Checklist. The loadmaster is responsible
         for accomplishing all other appropriate checklists, overall safety in the cargo compartment,
         monitoring static lines, etc.
         16.9.8.2.4. Jumpmaster duties can be performed from any position in either jump door or
         ramp and door; however, it is recommended that the jumpmaster use the right door for
         right-hand patterns and the left door for left-hand patterns. The jumpmaster, when wearing a
         troop-type parachute, will use the anchor cable as a hook-up point; when wearing a restraint
         harness, he will hook up to the personnel restraint system.
         WARNING: During paratroop door static line personnel drops, personnel will not position
         themselves directly under the center anchor cable supports (A-frame, FS 737).
      16.9.8.3. Use the Search and Rescue Airdrop Checklist for PJ JMD personnel or Equipment/
      RAMZ/ATV. Leave the red light on for dry passes and streamer/spotter chute patterns. On final
      for live drops, the pilot will make a "crew, 1 minute warning" call, at which time the loadmaster/
      jumpmaster will announce "Safety checks complete." Once safety checks are complete, and the
      pilot determines that all conditions are favorable for deployment upon reaching the planned/
      desired exit point, the pilot states "Clear to jump" and the pilot not flying will turn on the green
      light.
         16.9.8.3.1. The words "No-drop" announced over the interphone by any person after the
         pilot's "crew, 1 minute warning" call will terminate deployment procedures until the situation
         is resolved. Upon hearing a "No-drop" call, the pilot not flying will turn the red light on, and
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            223


        the pilot not flying and loadmaster will acknowledge the "No-drop." For an equipment bundle
        "No-drop," avoid abrupt maneuvers and make all turns as level as possible as the equipment is
        restrained by the release gate only at this point.
        16.9.8.3.2. For the confined lake or near shore RAMZ training, do not call "crew, 1 minute
        warning" until over water. Call "No-drop" if the exit point for the RAMZ will be over land.
        When notified of a malfunction in which the equipment bundle does not exit the aircraft, the
        pilot will maintain a level attitude until the ramp and door are closed and the load is secured.
        Maintain drop airspeed and altitude if possible and avoid overflying the survivor.
     16.9.8.4. The aircraft will be maneuvered at 150 KIAS or below in a racetrack pattern. Deploy-
     ment airspeed is 125 KIAS. Set flaps to 50% below 140,000 lbs and 70% at or above 140,000 lbs.
     If use of CDS flap setting is desired, perform a navigator directed release using the container
     delivery system checklist. Pararescuemen will not be deployed from aircraft with gross weights
     greater than 155,000 lbs. Static line deployments at airspeeds above 130 KIAS are prohibited due
     to parachute limitations. Symmetrical power settings will be used.
        16.9.8.4.1. The normal flight pattern will be a racetrack pattern, with the final approach from
        spotting device to target. The pattern will be large enough to allow for heading corrections on
        final approach. The crosswind leg will be made as soon as possible after the spotting device or
        jumper clears the aircraft. It is important that the target area remain in sight at all times.
        16.9.8.4.2. The deployment pattern may be flown on autopilot. The jumpmaster must be kept
        advised of the position of the aircraft in the pattern and the aircraft commander must be kept
        informed of the activities in the rear of the aircraft.
     16.9.8.5. Pararescue Deployment--Fixed Target. Head directly toward the target regardless of
     the wind direction. Release the spotter chute/streamer directly over the target. Immediately upon
     release, make left/right turn to observe descent and position of spotter chute/streamer. Establish
     racetrack drop pattern oriented so that the final approach will be aligned with the spotter chute/
     streamer and the target, respectively. Make minor heading changes to pass over the spotter chute
     and the target on a direct line. Aircraft drift correction should be established prior to passing over
     the spotter chute. The jumpmaster will reverse count over the target. After jumpers clear the air-
     craft, turn to observe the accuracy of the drop. Figure 16.1. gives procedures for the fixed wind
     pattern.

NOTES:
Use the following procedures while flying the pattern:
           1. Head directly toward the target, regardless of the wind direction.
           2. Release the spotter chute/streamer directly over the target.
           3. Immediately upon release make left/right turn to observe descent and position of spotter
              chute/ streamer.
           4. Establish racetrack drop pattern oriented so the final approach will be aligned with the
              spotter chute/ streamer and the target, respectively.
           5. Turn on Final.
       16.9.8.6. Pararescue Deployment--Moving Target. Head directly toward the target, regardless
       of the wind direction. Release the spotter chute/streamer directly over the target and begin timing.
       Immediately upon release, make left/right hand turn to observe descent and position of spotter
       chute. Establish racetrack drop pattern oriented so the final approach will be aligned with the
       spotter chute/streamer and the target, respectively. The pattern should be adjusted so the aircraft
       will be over the target 5 to 9 minutes after the spotter chute is launched. Turn on approach. Make
       minor changes to pass over the spotter chute/streamer and the target on a direct line. Aircraft drift

       correction should be established prior to passing over the spotter chute/streamer. JM will reverse
       count over the target. Figure 16.2. gives procedures for moving target procedures.

           5. Turn on Final.
       16.9.8.7. Pararescue Deployment--Crosswind Target. Fly over target on crosswind heading in
       a direction to permit a left/right hand pattern. Release the spotter chute or streamers directly over
       the target. Make another 180 degree turn to place the aircraft on the approach leg the same dis-
       tance upwind from the target as the spotter chute is downwind. Turn on final approach. PJs

       deploy when the aircraft is on a direct line with the target and spotter chute or streamers. After
       jumper clears the aircraft, turn to observe the accuracy of the drop. Figure 16.3. gives the proce-
       dures for crosswind patterns.

NOTES:
Use the following procedures while flying the pattern:
           1. Fly over target on crosswind heading in a direction to permit a left/right hand pattern.
           2. Release the spotter chute/streamer directly over the target.
           3. Make another 180 degree turn to place the aircraft on the approach leg the same distance
              upwind from the target as the spotter chute is downwind.

       16.9.8.8. Pararescue Deployments to Ships. Many factors affect the decision to deploy PJs to
       ships at sea, precluding the establishment of a single procedure that will apply to all situations. In
       all cases, thorough preplanning and coordination with the recovery vessel is vital to a safe and suc-
       cessful operation. The following will provide guidelines and considerations:
          16.9.8.8.1. In sea conditions other than calm, it is essential that the ship have a motorized
          launch in the water prior to team deployment, unless the PJ team deploys with a Rigging Alter-
          nate Method Zodiac watercraft.
          16.9.8.8.2. Positioning and maneuvering of the ship and launch is the ship captain's decision.
          When possible though, the aircraft commander should coordinate with the captain on position-
          ing and maneuvering prior to deployment. The crew should determine whether the ship can
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              227


          remain still in the water, whether the ship will be steered into the wind or crosswind, and
          where the launch will be positioned.
          16.9.8.8.3. The rescue aircraft should deploy the pararescue team to the motorized launch.
          The launch should maintain its position during the deployment pattern.
          WARNING: Anytime a pararescueman is in the water alongside a ship, the ship's propellers
          should be shut down.
          16.9.8.8.4. In the case that a decision is made to deploy the team without the use of a motor-
          ized launch, it is critical that the method of boarding is verified prior to deployment.
      16.9.8.9. Post-Deployment. Maintain visual or radio contact with the pararescue team and main-
      tain surveillance of the area for possible natural or man-made hazards. After pararescue deploy-
      ment, the aircraft commander will notify the appropriate agencies to ensure required team support
      is provided. Every effort will be expended to ensure that the pararescue team is covered by rescue
      aircraft until the party is assured of surface assistance. Surface assistance for land operation is not
      required as long as sufficient supplies are available. Prior to departure of the aircraft from the inci-
      dent site, resupply schedules, communication schedules, supply requirements, and planned actions
      of the pararescue team will be established by the aircraft commander and team leader.
      WARNING: The HC-130 aircrew will prepare an MA-1 sea rescue kit for deployment from the
      cargo ramp as soon as practical following an open water PJ deployment (not required for training).
          16.9.8.9.1. Primary and alternate frequencies, schedules, and an alternate method of commu-
          nication will be established by the mission commander and will be included in the mission
          commander's pre-mission brief.
              16.9.8.9.1.1. If practicable, the pararescuemen will immediately establish radio contact
              with the drop aircraft upon penetration of the incident site. The team leader will verify the
              predetermined schedule for the next radio contact before the drop aircraft departs the area.
              16.9.8.9.1.2. In the event the PJ team fails to establish communication at the initial
              pre-briefed time, maximum effort will be made on the next check or the alternate schedule
              until radio contact is established.
              16.9.8.9.1.3. If communication cannot be established through the procedures outlined
              above, any other method of communication may be used to relay information to the rescue
              team.
          16.9.8.9.2. Radio will be used as the primary method of communication. The MK 13 day/
          night flares will be the alternate method. When signals for special purposes are needed, they
          may be locally devised.

16.10. High Altitude Airdrops:
   16.10.1. General. High altitude drop procedures may be employed during clandestine operations or
   areas where small arms threats preclude conventional low altitude deliveries. Only essential person-
   nel who have accomplished appropriate physiological training described in AFI 11-403 are permitted
   on mission aircraft for drops above 10,000 feet MSL. Airdrops conducted above 3,000 feet AGL are
   considered high altitude drops. EXCEPTION: RAMZ airdrops at or below 3,500 feet AGL are con-
228                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


      sidered low altitude drops. PSYOPS drops are governed by paragraph 16.11. and AFI
      11-2HC-130V3, Chapter 18.
      16.10.2. High Altitude Mission Requirements. In addition to the normal mission planning require-
      ments, the following are unique to high altitude operations:
         16.10.2.1. Prominent terrain features within the drop area should be selected to position the air-
         craft on the inbound course and to determine the release point.
         16.10.2.2. Preflight weather and winds must be analyzed to determine the most advantageous
         inbound course. Whenever possible, the inbound course should be into the average wind vector.
         16.10.2.3. The SCNS wind may be used to update preflight HARP winds and to determine and
         update the winds at altitude, provided the SCNS TAS is accurate (within 5 knots of TAS as deter-
         mined by TAS check).
         16.10.2.4. The SCNS will be used to assist in properly aligning the aircraft on the inbound course.
         16.10.2.5. All available radio aids may be used to assist in locating the HARP but should not be
         relied on as a means for release.
         16.10.2.6. Low level flight to the target area with a climb is most desirable for HALO or HAHO
         operations. This will enable the navigators to obtain current winds for updating the HARP. High
         level flights are also possible but the HARP will have to be based on preflight winds. For HALO,
         positive identification of the drop zone area must be confirmed electronically or visually prior to
         calling the release. For HALO or HAHO, all available navigational aids will be used to assist in
         positioning the aircraft over the HARP. The release may be accomplished visually.

NOTE:
On all training and exercise missions, unless prevented by airspace restrictions, update the preflight winds
at each altitude used to compute the HARP. Obtain these winds as near the DZ as possible.
         16.10.2.7. It is desirable that the aircraft be at drop altitude, inbound to the HARP not later than 6
         minutes prior to the HARP. This amount of time is necessary for the navigator to update the
         HARP and to position the aircraft on the correct inbound course.
         16.10.2.8. Aircrew will ensure all aspects of HALO/HAHO airdrops are discussed in detail at the
         Pilot-Jumpmaster and Navigator-Jumpmaster briefings. Insist on positive feedback when discuss-
         ing HARP location and wind data as well as resolving what items will be passed to the jumpmaster
         during flight. Terminology should be clear and unambiguous.
             16.10.2.8.1. For all HALO/HAHO operations, navigators will provide the jumpmaster with a
             magnetic course +/- 5 degrees and a distance (NM, KM, or meters) from the release point to
             the drop zone.
             16.10.2.8.2. Navigators will compare their HARP location and calculations with the jump-
             master's chart and calculations.
         16.10.2.9. In-flight changes to the HARP location or significant wind changes will be relayed to
         the jumpmaster as soon as possible.
      16.10.3. High Altitude Oxygen Requirements:
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             229


       16.10.3.1. Aircrew members will use supplemental oxygen as directed by AFI 11-202V3. Para-
       chutists may operate without the supplemental oxygen during unpressurized flight up to 13,000
       feet MSL provided the elapsed time above 10,000 feet MSL does not exceed 30 minutes per sortie.
       Under circumstances other than these, jumpers will use supplemental oxygen. Parachutists trans-
       fer from the aircraft or portable oxygen console to a personal oxygen system at approximately 1
       minute before green light.
       16.10.3.2. When the aircraft installed oxygen system does not provide sufficient oxygen regula-
       tors for crew and parachutists, an oxygen console will be installed in the aircraft. The console will
       not be supplied from aircraft systems, but from separate high pressure aviators oxygen cylinders.
       The console will provide sufficient oxygen regulators for all parachutists and crewmembers not
       accommodated by the normal aircraft system.
       16.10.3.3. Carry the normal number of MA-1 units for the aircraft during operations conducted at
       or below 25,000 feet MSL. For operations conducted above 25,000 feet MSL, type MA-1 porta-
       ble oxygen units equipped with A-21 regulators and web carrying strap will be provided for each
       person aboard the aircraft. EXCEPTION: Parachutists.

NOTE:
All airdrops conducted above 25,000 feet MSL will require a waiver to AFI 11-202V3 for unpressurized
flight from HQ USAF/XOORF through MAJCOM/DOT.
       WARNING: Aircrew members will not be exposed to 30,000 feet MSL more than three times per
       7 days and must have a minimum of 24 hours between exposures.
       16.10.3.4. All personnel will prebreathe 100 percent oxygen at a cabin altitude as close to sea
       level as mission schedule allows for a drop at or above 18,000 feet MSL. Prebreathing will be
       started so as to have the required prebreathing time in Table 16.4. completed before the cabin alti-
       tude ascends through 10,000 feet MSL. A break in prebreathing requires that the prebreathing
       time be recycled or the person who broke prebreathing will be removed from the flight. All per-
       sonnel will remain on 100 percent oxygen until cabin altitude is below 10,000 feet MSL. When
       prebreathing is required, a launch crew may assist the primary crew to ensure the prebreathing
       requirement if met.
   16.10.4. Loadmaster Requirements. If an oxygen console is used, one loadmaster will be stationed
   aft to perform duties. The other loadmaster and aerospace physiology observer will be on interphone
   and normally forward of the oxygen console, if used, to perform in-flight duties. This arrangement
   will provide a buddy system to check everyone on oxygen.
   16.10.5. Aerospace Physiology Observer (ASPO) Requirements/Duties. An ASPO (AFSC 9166,
   91150, 91170, 91190) will accompany all missions operating unpressurized above 18,000 feet MSL
   regardless of the number of loadmasters or type of airdrop. The ASPO's duties will be to monitor
   in-flight personnel, aircraft and supplemental oxygen equipment and life support equipment. Pre-
   flight, as is practical, all aircraft and supplemental oxygen equipment, and life support equipment.
   The ASPO will advise and aid the loadmaster in positioning and securing the supplemental equip-
   ment used on the mission. The ASPO will brief all aircrew and jumpers prior to the first mission on
   the duties and responsibilities of the ASPO, physiological problems that may be encountered in flight,
   the importance of proper prebreathing, the effects of wind blast and cold air on exposed tissue, and
   any special circumstances for a given mission. The ASPO will be on interphone and will normally be

      positioned forward of the oxygen console (when used). The command coordinator, Aerospace Physi-
      ology, will provide a list of equipment and supplies that will be carried on board each flight and a list
      of records that will be kept during the flight by ASPO.

      16.10.6. High Altitude Personnel Drop (HALO or HAHO) Procedures. A high altitude release
      point (HARP) solution will be computed for all HALO or HAHO drops unless specific mission direc-
      tives dictate otherwise. Detailed instructions for computing the HARP are contained in AFI 11-231.
      Use the High Altitude Airdrop Checklist (Attachment 2). HALO or HAHO drops may be JMD.
         16.10.6.1. Pressurization Scheduling. Cabin differential pressure will be maintained until the
         Twenty Minute Warning, depressurization will be started so as to have cabin altitude equal to the
         ambient pressure prior to completion of the Ten Minute Warning. Repressurization after the drop
         will be in accordance with mission requirements; normally, the cabin altitude should return to
         10,000 feet or below as soon as possible. If any jumpers are still onboard, ensure the parachutes
         are safetied prior to descending or repressurizing.
         16.10.6.2. Drop Configuration:
             16.10.6.2.1. Flaps. Normal configuration is with 50 percent flaps. However, at high alti-
             tudes, it may be desirable to use less flaps.
             16.10.6.2.2. Airspeed. The jumpmaster will be briefed on the airspeed used.
             16.10.6.2.3. Altitude. Pressure or indicated altitude will be used as the airdrop altitude refer-
             ence.
             16.10.6.2.4. Exits. Parachutists will normally exit from the cargo ramp and door. All para-
             chutists, with the exception of the jumpmaster, will stand forward of the ramp hinge until the
             One-Minute Warning.
                 16.10.6.2.4.1. One or both paratroop doors may be used in lieu of the cargo ramp and
                 door. When this is the case, air deflector doors will be opened. All parachutists, except
                 jumpmaster, will stand forward of the paratroop doors until the One Minute Warning.

NOTE:
Jump platforms must be installed.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                          231


              16.10.6.2.4.2. All parachutists, including jumpmaster, will exit the aircraft during the
              green light time.
      16.10.6.3. Communications and Signals:
          16.10.6.3.1. The loadmaster will coordinate the following hand signals with the jumpmaster:
          16.10.6.3.2. Time warnings (20-, 10-, 6-, 2-, and 1-minute) may be given to the parachutists
          by the loadmaster pointing at a watch and then indicating with fingers the correct warning.
          16.10.6.3.3. The velocity of winds on the DZ will be given by the loadmaster by cupping one
          hand and blowing into it, then indicating with upturned fingers the speed of the wind.
          16.10.6.3.4. A no drop will be indicated by passing the clenched fist.
          16.10.6.3.5. Loadmasters will have pencil and paper available during airdrops for use in com-
          municating with parachutists.
      16.10.6.4. Briefing. In addition to the pilot-jumpmaster briefing, the pilot will brief the jump-
      master regarding:
          16.10.6.4.1. Weather.
          16.10.6.4.2. Emergency descent procedures and time to descend to 10,000 feet MSL.
          16.10.6.4.3. Pressurization schedule.
          16.10.6.4.4. High altitude release point (HARP) and prominent terrain features.
          16.10.6.4.5. DZ markings.
          16.10.6.4.6. Time at which all mission personnel will commence prebreathing.
          16.10.6.4.7. Location and duration of the green light.
      16.10.6.5. Emergency Procedures. If any person experiences decompression sickness or
      unusual pain, the pilot will:
          16.10.6.5.1. Abort the mission.
          16.10.6.5.2. Begin a descent (pressurization and descent will be determined by the type and
          degree of sickness or pain).
          16.10.6.5.3. Proceed to the nearest base at which qualified medical assistance is available.
          16.10.6.5.4. Advise the control tower of the emergency and request an ambulance and doctor
          meet the aircraft.
          16.10.6.5.5. HQ ACC/SGP and HQ USAF/SGPA will be notified by the most expeditious
          manner of any physiological incident.

16.11. Other Operations:
   16.11.1. PSYOPS Drops (Leaflets). Airdrop and dispersal of large quantities of printed materials is
   possible using prepackaged leaflets. Drop altitudes may vary from 500 ft AGL to the aircraft service
   ceiling. Use high altitude oxygen requirements as specified in Table 16.4. Drops require the move-
   ment of boxes of various weights from throughout the cargo compartment via intermediate rollers (if
   required) to the ramp area for dispersal off the ramp.
232                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         16.11.1.1. Equipment. In addition to normal aircraft equipment, the following items may be
         required to perform leaflet drops:
             16.11.1.1.1. Parachutes or restraining harnesses must be available for use by all personnel
             working in the cargo compartment. Normally, six are required.
             16.11.1.1.2. A portable oxygen console with a minimum of four regulators and output hoses
             of sufficient length to reach through the entire cargo compartment must be available for high
             altitude airdrops (above 10,000 feet).
             16.11.1.1.3. An interval timer is desirable (alternating red and green jump lights may serve for
             sequencing the drops).
             WARNING: Aircrew members will not be exposed to 30,000 feet MSL more than three times
             per 7 days and must have a minimum of 24 hours between exposures.

NOTES:

                1. All airdrops conducted above FL250 require a waiver to AFI 11-202V3.
                2. Long duration high altitude drops will require the aircraft remain open. Consider out-
                   side air temperature and clothing requirements prior to step.
         16.11.1.2. Aircrew Procedures. Under normal circumstances the crew required for leaflet oper-
         ations consists of a tactical crew plus two ASPOs (for high altitude airdrops) and three additional
         crew members to act as feeders. The senior loadmaster will assign specific positions for activity
         in the cargo compartment.
             16.11.1.2.1. Drop Configuration/Maneuvering. Base configuration on desired coverage
             and airframe airspeed limitations. All personnel should be constantly aware of the possibility
             of an emergency break upon encountering a threat.
                16.11.1.2.1.1. Flaps. Flaps are normally set at 50 percent and flap settings should not be
                changed during the drop unless the loadmaster is notified.
                16.11.1.2.1.2. Airspeed. Base KIAS on desired groundspeed. This may range from 130
                KIAS to 150 KIAS. Other speed ranges may apply if not dropping of the ramp (i.e., cargo
                door only).
                16.11.1.2.1.3. Static Lines. To increase speed of closing the ramp if a hostile threat is
                detected and to prevent damage to the aircraft, the static lines should be stowed after each
                box goes out. Do this if the interval between boxes permits safe operation. Static lines
                may be cut in an emergency.
                16.11.1.2.1.4. Refer to Attachment 2 and Chapter 18 for specific normal and emergency
                procedures.

16.12. Airdrop Load Information:
      16.12.1. General. This section contains specific information about the actual load to be dropped.
      Both normal and emergency procedures are covered. Loads can exit the aircraft from the paratroop
      doors, cargo ramp and door (tailgate), or flare launcher tubes.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                                233


       16.12.1.1. If the aircraft is configured with a static line retriever, static line tailgate drops of per-
       sonnel is authorized. Comply with current training and evaluation directives prior to conducting
       these drops.
       16.12.1.2. Combination drops are those during which parachutists exit from the aircraft cargo
       ramp after the deployment of an airdrop load. The drop altitude will be determined by the item
       requiring the highest drop altitude. In addition to the equipment CARP, the navigator will com-
       pute a personnel CARP 10 seconds down track from the equipment release point using the same
       IAS and altitude as for the equipment. If the point of impact falls within 150 yards of any bound-
       ary of the drop zone, inform the jumpmaster.
       16.12.1.3. If a malfunction occurs during an airdrop, the loadmaster will immediately notify the
       pilot and take appropriate action. After all appropriate emergency actions are complete, accom-
       plish the completion of Drop Checklist.

NOTE:
Prior to takeoff, the pilot will ensure that all crewmembers have reviewed the emergency procedures for
the proposed airdrop. Detailed emergency briefings will be conducted between the loadmasters. Load-
masters will brief visual and verbal signals and establish coordinated tasks for their crew position prior to
the first airdrop warning.
   16.12.2. Personnel Drops:
       16.12.2.1. Aircraft Configuration. The aircrew loadmaster will ensure the configuration of the
       aircraft anchor cables and seats are consistent with the number of personnel to be airdropped.
       During aircraft preflight, the loadmaster will ensure that all seats have a serviceable retaining strap
       attached. Fit seats without a serviceable retaining strap with a suitable length of type III nylon,
       premeasured for sufficient length to secure the seat in a raised position to the seat back support
       frame. Low altitude personnel drops are normally accomplished from the paratroop doors. For
       single pass drops, ensure that parachutists have secured all seats (as required) and no part of the
       seat protrudes into the aisle. On multiple passes, the number of parachutists to be dropped on that
       pass determines the number of seats raised. Airborne personnel will raise and secure or lower
       seats as required under the supervision and instruction of the aircrew loadmaster.
       16.12.2.2. Aircrew Procedures. Use the Personnel Airdrop Checklist.
       16.12.2.3. Loadmaster-Jumpmaster Control. At completion of the Slowdown Checklist, the
       loadmaster will allow the jumpmaster access to the paratroop door by 1 minute prior to jump. For
       jumpmaster-directed airdrops using the Search and Rescue Airdrop Checklist, after Pre-Deploy-
       ment checks are complete, the loadmaster will allow the jumpmaster access to paratropp door or
       ramp and door, as appropriate by 2 minutes prior to the jump. The loadmaster will then take posi-
       tion on the cargo ramp in such a manner as to provide maximum maneuverability for the jump-
       masters and safety NCOs to perform their duties. For ramp and cargo door exits, the loadmaster(s)
       will take a position to prevent interference with exiting jumpers. Upon seeing the red jump lights
       illuminate, the loadmaster will notify the jumpmaster or safety personnel of the red light condi-
       tion. The loadmaster will take no further action to stop any of the remaining parachutists. The
       loadmaster will count (if possible) any parachutists that exit the aircraft after the red light has illu-
       minated. Control of the paratroop door/cargo ramp will revert back to the loadmaster after all
       parachutists have exited or remaining parachutists have been stopped by the jumpmaster or safety
234                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         NCO and cleared from the paratroop door/cargo ramp area. For multiple passes (i.e., racetracks),
         after assuming control of the paratroop door/cargo ramp from the jumpmaster, the loadmaster(s)
         will maintain control of the doors/cargo ramp until completion of subsequent Slowdown Check-
         lists.
         WARNING: During airdrops, personnel will not position themselves directly under the center
         anchor cable supports (A-frame, FS 737). Ensure all personnel aft of FS 677 are secured to the air-
         craft or have a static line connected prior to opening the ramp and door/troop door. HALO/HAHO
         personnel must be configured and ready to jump.
         16.12.2.4. Aircraft Emergency During Personnel Drop. When an aircraft emergency occurs
         during or after the time the parachutists stand-up and hookup, the following procedures will apply:
             16.12.2.4.1. Under Acceptable Conditions:
                 16.12.2.4.1.1. Maintain an acceptable altitude and attitude for the parachutists to evacuate
                 the aircraft. The minimum acceptable altitude is 400 feet AGL for static line deployments
                 and 1000 AGL feet for personnel freefall deployments. If the jump must be made at an air-
                 speed in excess of 150 KIAS, parachutists will be advised of the airspeed and altitude.
                 16.12.2.4.1.2. Order evacuation of the aircraft by giving the prebriefed signals for prepa-
                 ration and bailout.
             16.12.2.4.2. Under Unacceptable Conditions. When conditions are not acceptable for air-
             craft evacuation or drop is aborted for other reasons, the following procedures will apply:
                 16.12.2.4.2.1. The red light will be turned "ON" and will remain on until exit doors are
                 closed.
                 16.12.2.4.2.2. The pilot will advise the loadmaster, who in turn will advise the jumpmas-
                 ter, to have the parachutists unhook, take their seats, and fasten their safety belts.
      16.12.3. Fouled Parachutist Procedures. The jumpmaster or safety is responsible to observe the
      fouled parachutist and recommend whether to retrieve or cut the parachutist free. If all parachutists
      have exited and there is no jumpmaster on board, this responsibility rests with the loadmaster. The
      recommendation is relayed, by the loadmaster, to the pilot who makes the final decision whether to
      retrieve or cut the parachutist free. The loadmaster will initiate retrieval or cut the parachutist's static
      line on the pilot's command. When a parachutist is observed to be fouled during a paratroop door exit,
      the first priority is to retrieve, regardless if the parachutist is conscious or unconscious. If the para-
      chutist cannot be retrieved and indicates consciousness, the parachutist will be cut free. For a tailgate
      exit, the first priority is to cut the parachutist free if the parachutist indicates consciousness. If the
      parachutist is unconscious, does not signal, cannot be observed, or a condition exists that prevents cut-
      ting the static line, implement emergency retrieval procedures.
         16.12.3.1. The jumpmaster stops remaining parachutists and the loadmaster notifies the pilot of a
         fouled parachutist.
         16.12.3.2. Upon being notified of a fouled parachutist, the pilot should lower the landing gear and
         configure the aircraft flap setting to 100 percent flaps (paratroop door exits only).
         WARNING: If a parachutist becomes fouled during missions when the aircraft is operating with
         a high gross weight or is flying in a high density altitude environment, the pilot may elect to main-
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                               235


       tain flaps at 50 percent, landing gear up, and slow to Minimum Operating Speed (MOS) in lieu of
       the standard procedure.

NOTE:
Compute MOS using power off stall speed with 50 percent flap setting at 30 degrees of bank plus 5 knots.
This information will be posted on the operational data form prior to all static line paratroop door deploy-
ments.
       16.12.3.3. The pilot maintains at least the minimum drop altitude (AGL) for the type parachute
       being used, and avoids flying over or upwind of water or built up areas. EXCEPTION: If the
       parachutist is SCUBA equipped, the pilot should avoid flying over land.
       CAUTION: If possible, the pilot will avoid turning the aircraft in the direction of the fouled para-
       chutist. Turning into the parachutist often starts violent swinging of the parachutist and poses an
       increased possibility of injury to the fouled parachutist.
       16.12.3.4. The copilot turns on the red light.
       16.12.3.5. The parachutist indicates consciousness and that the reserve parachute is ready by
       maintaining a tight body position with both hands on the reserve parachute.
       16.12.3.6. If the pilot's decision is to cut the parachutist free, the parachutist's static line will be
       cut by the loadmaster on the pilot's command.
       16.12.3.7. If the decision is to retrieve the parachutist, refer to expanded checklist and AFI
       11-2HC-130V3 CL-2 for procedures.
   16.12.4. Door Bundles:
       16.12.4.1. Paratroop Door Bundle. A-7A and A-21 containers weighing up to 500 pounds,
       excluding the weight of the parachute, are referred to as door bundles. They may be dropped inde-
       pendently or in conjunction with personnel from the aircraft. Loads weighing more than 350
       pounds require two trained designated pushers to assist the jumpmaster in pushing loads from the
       aircraft. The minimum weight will vary according to the parachute used. Paratroop door bundles
       must weigh a minimum of 11 pounds per square foot. Airdrops are limited to one bundle per para-
       troop door. When dropped with personnel, the bundle must be rigged with a parachute having a
       breakaway static line and will be the first object to exit the aircraft. Restraint will be removed and
       the bundle positioned in the paratroop door prior to the completion of the slowdown checklist.
       The maximum door bundle size is 66" x 48" x 30". Specific aircraft preparation and rigging pro-
       cedures are contained in T.O.1C-130A-9.
       16.12.4.2. Ramp Bundle. A-7A and A-21 containers may be dropped off the ramp if a skid
       board with a minimum width of 42" is attached. A-22 containers may be dropped from the cargo
       ramp single stick. Ramp bundles must be rigged IAW T.O. 13C7-1-11/FM 10-501. The total
       weight of the bundle will not exceed 2335 pounds. Loads to be followed by parachutists will be
       rigged with breakaway static lines, unless specified in specific rigging directive. Restraint will be
       removed prior to the completion of the 10 minute checklist (EXCEPTION: the forward restraint
       may be removed after the cargo ramp and door are opened and prior to the completion of the slow-
       down checklist). The bundle will be released by the loadmaster and may be followed by person-
       nel. These procedures may be accomplished from either side of the ramp or from the centerline.
236                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         Specific aircraft preparation and rigging procedures are contained in T.O.1C-130A-9. Ramp bun-
         dles use the standard Personnel Checklist.
         16.12.4.3. Release Point. When door bundles are dropped with personnel, compute the CARP
         for the first paratrooper exiting after the bundle. Compute an additional CARP for the door bundle
         to ensure that it will impact within the DZ boundaries. Release the bundle at the personnel CARP,
         followed by the parachutists when the door is clear. When only a door bundle is being dropped,
         base the release on the CARP for the bundle.
         16.12.4.4. Standard Airdrop Training Bundle (SATB). The 15-pound standard airdrop train-
         ing bundle may be dropped to simulate personnel or equipment. Conduct SATB missions at the
         altitude and airspeed specified for the drop being simulated. Use the applicable airdrop checklist
         for the type airdrop simulated. SATBs will be assembled and have an identification tag attached in
         accordance with T.O. 13C7-1-11. SATBs will not be rigged with breakaway static line.
      16.12.5. Emergency Procedures. If a training bundle is outside the aircraft and fails to separate,
      make no attempt to retrieve it. Cut the bundle loose over the prebriefed salvo area or DZ. When sim-
      ulating an airdrop using the cargo ramp and door, a hung bundle could become wedged in the aircraft
      elevator during turns. If possible, cut the static line prior to making a turn.
      16.12.6. Free Fall Airdrops. The delivery of certain types of supplies, such as bulk food products or
      clothing, can be accomplished without the use of parachutes. For free-fall airdrops, wind drift need
      not be considered. Normally, free-fall airdrops are accomplished at much lower altitudes than those
      required for paradrops. Daylight drops will be made at 150 feet AGL and night drops no lower than
      500 feet AGL. DZ size will be determined by the trajectory of the items being dropped. As a rule, DZ
      length required equals the altitude of the aircraft over the release point plus a safety margin of 100 feet
      added to each end. Applying this rule, when dropping from 200 feet AGL, the required length will be
      200 feet (altitude) plus 200 feet (safety margin) or 400 feet total. Additional crewmembers may be
      needed to eject the load. Use either the Personnel Checklist or CDS Checklist, depending on flap set-
      ting and deck angle desired. EXCEPTION: Refer to Chapter 17 for guidance on rescue equipment
      (MA-1 kit, Parabundle, or Freefall) airdrops.
      16.12.7. Container Delivery System (CDS). The CDS is designed to airdrop up to 4 individual
      A-22 containers, single stick, from Rescue HC/MC-130 without a dual rail cargo handling system
      (intermediate rollers or skate wheels are required). The system may also be used to airdrop A-7, A-21,
      and double A-22 containers and loads rigged on combat expendable platforms. The weight of each
      container and type parachute used should be IAW T.O. 13C7-1-11/FM 10-501. Containers can be
      rigged and dropped one at a time or up to four in a single stick. Use normal CDS rigging procedures
      outlined in Chapter 7, T.O. 1C-130A-9, with the following exceptions: the release gate for single con-
      tainers, multiple containers that do not exceed 3500 pounds, and combat expendable platforms that do
      not exceed 3500 pounds, may be rigged using Type VIII nylon and may be released using manual
      knife cut procedures. For loads between 3100 pounds and 3500 pounds the release gate will be rigged
      using one turn double Type VIII nylon, and may be manually cut. Multiple container releases that
      exceed 3500 pounds require standard rigging and release with a static line retriever as outlined in
      Chapter 7, T.O. 1C-130A-9. After the release gate is cut, the airdrop load exits the aircraft by gravity
      force.
      CAUTION: Standard tiedown procedures contained in Chapter 4, T.O. 1C-130A-9, will be used to
      secure airdrop loads in the aircraft. Because a buffer stop assembly cannot be installed, the normal
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                                237


   maximum total container weight is 5000 pounds. When the total rigged weight of the airdrop load
   exceeds 5000, MAJCOM/DOT approval is required.
       16.12.7.1. Procedures. Compute a CARP and use the CDS Checklist. Accomplish the slow-
       down. As the airspeed decreases to drop airspeed, reset the flaps IAW the CDS flap setting chart
       (CDS abbreviated checklist). This will give an approximate 6 to 8 degree nose-high attitude.
       Maintain this attitude and level flight throughout the drop.
       WARNING: The aircraft will tend to pitch up as the load exits the aircraft. This pitch must be
       anticipated and controlled to allow no more than two or three degrees additional pitch. Do not
       over control to the point that negative G forces are encountered while the load is exiting the air-
       craft, as this increases exit time or may stop load movement.
          16.12.7.1.1. Manual Gate Cut. When authorized by a specific exercise operations order,
          plan, contingency or theater commander, and when prebriefed, perform a manual gate cut if
          the static line retriever fails at "Green Light." If this situation is called for, the loadmaster will
          pull down on the static line retriever cable until the gate releases or it is necessary to initiate
          malfunction checklist procedures. The decision to authorize a manual gate cut should be
          based on careful consideration of usable DZ length.

NOTE:
When dropping SATBs or 1-4 bundles, it is recommended that aircraft gross weight be no less than
104,000 pounds. If the drop must be made, use zero percent flaps and expect longer than normal exit
time. At gross weights above 104,000 pounds use the flap setting obtained from the 1-4 bundle line.
          16.12.7.1.2. Departing the DZ. Departing the DZ, set flaps to 50 percent, accelerate to 140
          KIAS, climb or descend as briefed, and perform the Completion of Drop Checklist. The flaps
          may be set to 50 percent as soon as the loadmaster calls "Load Clear."
       16.12.7.2. Restriction. For combination drops, comply with the provisions in T.O. 1C-130A-9.
   16.12.8. CDS Emergency Procedures. See expanded checklist .
   16.12.9. Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC) Drop. The raiding craft is normally an inflated,
   16 foot rubber boat mounted on a specially constructed expendable platform. Equipment and supplies
   (including outboard motor, fuel, and other supplies) are secured inside the boat. The platform,
   weighted with sandbags, sinks when it is cut away from the boat in the water. Total rigged weight is
   approximately 2000 pounds. The recovery parachute is a G-12D/E deployed by a 15 foot pilot chute
   packed in a T-10 deployment bag.
       16.12.9.1. Employment. Use the CDS Checklist. One CRRC with up to 19 personnel or 2
       (stacked) CRRC with 18 personnel can be safely airdropped on one pass. Compute a CARP,
       unless mission directives dictate otherwise.
          16.12.9.1.1. Operational. Normally, the release point will be more than 12 miles offshore
          over open water at night.
          16.12.9.1.2. Training and Exercises. One or more recovery boats will be in position to
          recover platforms, parachutes, and personnel. The boat should be displaced 400 yards or more
          from the DZ axis. The navigators can confirm the release point and the offset distance from
          the boat visually or by using radar returns.

         16.12.9.2. DZ Axis. If possible, the DZ axis will be into the drop altitude wind (+ or - 30 degrees)
         when the wind is 5 knots or greater. The jumpmaster will be advised if this cannot be complied
         with.
         16.12.9.3. Limitations. Use Table 16.5. for CRRC wind and sea state limitations.
         16.12.9.4. Emergency Procedures. Follow either CDS emergency procedures or fouled para-
         chutist procedures as required.

      16.12.10. Rigging, Alternate Method, Zodiac/All-Terrain Vehicle (RAMZ/ATV) Airdrops. The
      RAMZ consists of a deflated Zodiac F470 combat rubber raiding craft with a 35 horsepower outboard
      engine rigged for low velocity airdrop from any C-130 aircraft. The RAMZ engine is configured in a
      plywood box and is secured in a standard A-22 container using two modified T-10C parachutes. When
      rigged for deployment, the RAMZ package weighs between 600 and 1,000 pounds. Once in the water,
      the RAMZ is inflated to a size approximately 15 feet, 5 inches in length with a beam (width) of
      approximately 6 feet, 3 inches. The RAMZ has five main flotation tubes and three separate and iso-
      latable airtight chambers. It has a slatted wood floor and a wood transom, with a short-shaft submers-
      ible engine attached and readied for operation. Fuel is delivered from flexible 6-, 9-, or 18-gallon
      bladders. The ATV is rigged IAW Army Field Manual 10-577 and Air Force Technical Order
      13C7-55-1, Rigging Motorcycles (Chapter 6-ATV Procedures Interim). Section II, procedures are
      rigged in a double A-22 container w/G-12E cargo parachutes equipped with 15 ft. extraction (deploy-
      ment) parachute packed in T-10 deployment bag.
         16.12.10.1. Employment. The RAMZ/ATV package and three to six personnel can be air-
         dropped on a single pass to conduct small team tactical, nontactical water or surface operations.
             16.12.10.1.1. Drop Altitude. Parachutists may exit the aircraft using HALO/HAHO or static
             line procedures. Refer to AFI 11-231 for minimum drop altitudes.
             16.12.10.1.2. DZ Axis. If possible, the DZ axis will be into the drop altitude wind (+ or - 30
             degrees) when the wind is 5 knots or greater. The jumpmaster will be advised when this can-
             not be complied with.
             16.12.10.1.3. For jumpmaster directed RAMZ/ATV drops, a navigator's CARP/HARP is not
             required when using streamers/spotter chutes.
         16.12.10.2. Aircraft Preparation. The aircraft will be configured IAW AFI 11-2HC-130V3,
         Addenda A. The RAMZ/ATV package will be delivered to the aircraft fully rigged and prepared
         for loading on the aircraft. The loadmaster is responsible for aircraft preparation, rigging the
         release gate, attaching the static line, and securing the package in the aircraft.
             16.12.10.2.1. RAMZ/ATV Preflight. Prior to flight, the loadmaster will ensure that no fuel
             is leaking from the RAMZ/ATV bundle. A leaking bundle will not be loaded aboard the air-
             craft or will be downloaded if already aboard. The fuel bladders have a tendency to emit
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                                239


           fumes. If one or more RAMZ/ATV are loaded aboard the aircraft the day prior to flight, there
           may be noticeable fumes in the aircraft the following day. The fumes may be decreased/elim-
           inated by venting the aircraft overnight. One technique is to close both paratroop doors onto
           the extended jump platforms and secure them with tie down straps. If the RAMZ/ATV is emit-
           ting fumes and the aircraft must temporarily remain pressurized, taping the urinal covers open
           may reduce or eliminate the fumes.
           WARNING: If flammable fumes are present, unnecessary electrical equipment/switches will
           not be turned on or off until the fumes are eliminated. Use 100 percent oxygen and accomplish
           the Smoke and Fume Elimination Checklist as appropriate.
           WARNING: Only 15-foot static lines will be used on the RAMZ cargo parachutes. A 12-foot
           static line extended to 15 feet will not be used. If personnel are to follow immediately after the
           RAMZ, their static lines will also be 15 feet.

NOTE:
A maximum of three RAMZ/ATV bundles can be rigged on the Rescue HC/MC-130 when the aircraft
internal fuel tanks are installed.
           WARNING: When rigging two RAMZ/ATV bundles on the cargo ramp, use extreme care to
           ensure the aircraft CG remains within tolerances.
           CAUTION: For RAMZ deployments at night, two illumination parachute flares will be
           loaded into the flare launcher tubes prior to starting the pre-slowdown checklist. The flare
           launcher must remain "deactivated" and "safe" until personnel and equipment have deployed
           and are a safe distance from the aircraft.

NOTE:
When loaded aboard the aircraft, the vertical restraint tie down strap on the RAMZ will be secured in such
a manner that it is not placed over any fuel bladder, just tight enough to take the slack out of the strap. The
vertical strap acts as a backup to the 5,000-pound gate.
           16.12.10.2.2. Airplanes with Static Line Retriever:
               16.12.10.2.2.1. Position the left/right anchor cable stop at FS 893 and tape. The left/right
               anchor cable will be utilized for attachment of both the container and the personnel static
               lines.
               16.12.10.2.2.2. Parachutists using static line deployed parachutes will attach their static
               lines to the same anchor cable to which the RAMZ/ATV static lines are attached or jump
               on a subsequent pass after the RAMZ/ATV static line deployment bags are retrieved.
           16.12.10.2.3. Airplanes without Static Line Retriever:
           WARNING: Static lines for both RAMZ/ATV and parachutists will be hooked to the same
           anchor cable. No more than 20 static lines may be airdropped on a single pass (i.e., one
           RAMZ/ATV and 19 jumpers, two RAMZ/ATV and 18 jumpers, etc.).
               16.12.10.2.3.1. Install and tape anchor cable stop at FS 749 for single cable use. RAMZ/
               ATV static lines will be attached to this cable.
240                                        AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


             16.12.10.2.3.2. Parachutists using static line deployed parachutes will exit on a subse-
             quent pass (through the paratroop door) using Fixed/Moving target PJD procedures, as
             appropriate, after the RAMZ/ATV static line deployment is completed and the ramp and
             aft cargo door is closed. After the RAMZ/ATV drop is complete, run the Post-Deployment
             Checklist, then initiate the Pre-Deployment Checklist. Parachutists using freefall para-
             chutes may exit from the aircraft ramp on the same pass after the RAMZ/ATV static line
             deployment bags are retrieved or cut.
             WARNING: Parachutists using static line deployed parachutes will not exit over the ramp
             on airplanes without an operational static line retriever.
         16.12.10.2.4. Skid boards must be a minimum of 48 by 48 inches.
      16.12.10.3. Deployment Procedures. The RAMZ/ATV and personnel can be dropped on a sin-
      gle pass navigator directed release using the CDS Checklist flap setting or 50/70% flap setting
      (based on aircraft gross weight). RAMZ/ATV packages and jumpers may also be dropped using
      jumpmaster-directed procedures with 50/70% flaps, as appropriate. During the slowdown check-
      list, (for navigator directed drops) or Pre-Deployment Checklist (for jumpmaster directed drops),
      vertical and forward restraint straps will be removed from the RAMZ/ATV package. For a navi-
      gator directed single pass delivert when CDS flap settings are to be used, as the airspeed decreases
      to drop airspeed (130 KIAS), reset the flaps IAW the CDS flap setting chart for one bundle. Use
      of the CDS flap setting will give the airplane an approximate 6- to 8-degree nose high attitude and
      level flight throughout the drop. CDS flap settings will not be used during multiple pass jump-
      master directed airdrops.
         16.12.10.3.1. The minimum deployment altitude will be 3,500 feet AWL/AGL when the PJs
         exit using non-static line deployed parachutes. Higher altitudes may be used for training.
             16.12.10.3.1.1. For operational missions, minimum altitude with non-static line deployed
             parachutes is 2,500 feet AWL/AGL.
             16.12.10.3.1.2. If the tactical situation and/or low ceilings prevent the use of freefall para-
             chutes, the PJs will deploy using static line parachutes immediately following the RAMZ
             package (aircraft with a static line retriever and anchor cable) or using fixed or moving tar-
             get procedures (as appropriate) and deploying to the RAMZ/ATV package out of a para-
             troop door on a subsequent pass. The RAMZ and PJs will be deployed from the same
             altitude.
             16.12.10.3.1.3. The minimum deployment altitude for training or non-combat single-pass
             combination air drops of RAMZ/ATV and PJs will be 800 feet AWL/AGL.
         16.12.10.3.2. For jumpmaster-directed drops, at the pilot's "ONE MINUTE ADVISORY"
         call, the jumpmaster will be on the left side of the cargo ramp and may be spotting from the aft
         end. Additional jumpers will be forward of the RAMZ/ATV. The loadmaster will be posi-
         tioned to remove aft restraint and to observe equipment and jumpers at all times. At the "ONE
         MINUTE ADVISORY," the jumpmaster will be alerted, the load release gate is checked, and
         the aft restraint is removed.
         WARNING: If a "No-drop" is called and the RAMZ/ATV is held in place by only the release
         gate strap, all personnel will move forward of the ramp hinge, except the loadmaster and the
         jumpmaster who will monitor the RAMZ/ATV for possible shifting and secure as necessary.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                         241


             16.12.10.3.2.1. The loadmaster will relay "Safety checks complete" to the pilot if the
             jumpmaster has already gone off interphone. The pilot not flying will turn on the green
             light, indicating to the jumpmaster that conditions are satisfctory for the airdrop.
             16.12.10.3.2.2. The jumpmaster will determine the exit point and deploy prior to receiv-
             ing a "No-drop" notification or seeing the red light on. The loadmaster will relay to the
             pilot all visual corrections given by the jumpmaster. The jumpmaster will signal for the
             loadmaster to cut the release gate. If jumpers are freefall parachuting, they will not exit
             until after the loadmaster has retrieved the RAMZ/ATV parachute D-bags.
             WARNING: If the RAMZ/ATV exits the aircraft but fails to properly deploy, the static
             lines will be cut immediately.
             CAUTION: The release gate must be cut below the knot to allow the nylon strap to pull
             free through floor tie down rings.
          16.12.10.3.3. For navigator-directed drops, the navigator determines the release point and
          assumes the responsibility to call "Five Seconds" and "Green Light." The navigator will com-
          pute a CARP using the procedures in AFI 11-231. The loadmaster will relay pertinent infor-
          mation to the jumpmaster. At release point (Green Light), the loadmaster will manually cut
          the RAMZ/ATV bundle loose which will signal the jumpers are clear to follow the gravity
          ejected load.
          16.12.10.3.4. Completion of Drop. During JMD airdrops, post-deployment checks can be
          deferred until completion of the last drop. However, crews will accomplish applicable steps of
          the Post-Deployment Checklist and reaccomplish the Pre-Deployment Checklist, as required,
          when necessary to change the aircraft or door configuration. For navigator directed releases,
          after completion of the drop, set the flaps to 50 percent, accelerate to 140 KIAS, climb or
          descend as briefed, and perform the Completion of Drop Checklist. The flaps may be set to 50
          percent as soon as the loadmaster calls "Load clear."
      16.12.10.4. Training and Exercises. One or more safety recovery boats will be in position to
      recover platforms, parachutes, and personnel. The boat should be displaced 400 yards or more
      from the DZ axis. The navigators can confirm the release point and the offset distance from the
      boat visually or by using radar returns.
      16.12.10.5. Limitations. During training, use Table 16.6. for RAMZ wind and sea state limita-
      tions. Limitations for operational or contingency missions will be determined by the jumpmaster,
      in coordination with the aircraft commander.
      16.12.10.6. Emergency Procedures. Follow either the CDS emergency procedures or fouled
      parachutist procedures.

16.13. Formation Procedures:
242                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


      16.13.1. General. This chapter prescribes basic formation procedures for Combat Shadow aircraft.
      They are primarily designed to be used in VMC. IMC procedures are employed in extraordinary cir-
      cumstances when IMC is encountered inadvertently or when the mission demands that IMC must be
      penetrated. Accomplish formation in IMC in an ATC environment IAW FAA or host nation proce-
      dures. Dissimilar formation and other generic formation procedures, such as overhead recoveries, are
      found in Chapter 8 of this volume.
      WARNING: Operation under VFR clearance in IMC conditions is an emergency procedure during
      training and exercise operations, requiring appropriate IFF and radio calls to the area air traffic control
      agency. During contingency or combat missions, the necessity of flying "comm-out" in IMC must be
      weighed against terrain clearance capability and the increased mid-air potential.
         16.13.1.1. Type and Size. Formation size and type are dictated by aircraft resources available,
         ingress and egress environment, terrain, weather, route, altitude to be flown, and mission objec-
         tives. Refer to Chapter 8 for general formation procedures and information including: command
         and lead, specified times, radio discipline, pretakeoff and takeoff procedures.
         16.13.1.2. Night Vision Goggle Takeoffs. Accomplish the Low-level checklist prior to taking
         the active runway. Lighting should be set IAW the lighting chart with the exception of the IR anti
         collision light. Turn on the IR anticollision light on immediately after takeoff and turn it off after
         the wingmen have rejoined.
         16.13.1.3. Assembly:
             16.13.1.3.1. Rejoin versus Reform. Any time you split up the formation, a rejoin is required.
             Approval for any wingman to rejoin the formation is granted by the formation lead. A
             "reform" is used when spacing has been altered but the formation has not been split up. No
             approval is required to reform and it is typically inherent in your phase of flight. Examples of
             rejoin situations are; following an IMC break or Preplanned weather penetration prior to mov-
             ing back to a visual formation, and after initial takeoff or low approach (no request required for
             initial takeoff or low approach). Examples of reform situations are; position changes, closing
             up the formation after a helicopter air refueling, moving from close to fluid trail and back, and
             moving back to your formation position after an air refueling.

NOTE:
The formation commander will brief how rejoins and position changes are to be accomplished in the VFR
pattern. If multiple formation recoveries are planned for the VFR pattern, it may be preferable to brief
that rejoins in the pattern are directly to trail and for wingmen to call "in" when in position.
             16.13.1.3.2. Wing aircraft will assemble to the inside of the turn during a turning rejoin or to
             right echelon during a straight ahead rejoin. Once the rejoin has been initiated (about 1/2
             mile), remain on that wing for the duration of the rejoin. If lead is in a left turn and rolls out
             after wingmen have committed to a left turning rejoin, movement to the right side of lead may
             be accomplished if spacing is sufficient and overtake is under control. If the rejoin is nearly
             complete and movement to the right side is inappropriate, stay on the left until normal move to
             trail can be accomplished. The formation lead will prebrief power settings and airspeed to be
             used if they are different than 180 KIAS and 970 degrees C TIT.
             16.13.1.3.3. The time wingmen spend in echelon should be ONLY long enough to ensure the
             lead aircraft sees that they have rejoined. If overtake is under control, the rejoin to echelon can
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            243


        be one smooth movement to trail. As three or four, rejoin to echelon off the preceding aircraft
        (regardless if still in echelon or has moved to trail). Ensure your echelon position allows leads
        loadmasters to see you have rejoined the formation. Remember, the only function of echelon
        is to allow lead to account for all aircraft in the formation.
        16.13.1.3.4. Aircraft aborting will follow prebriefed emergency procedures and hold clear of
        departing traffic. Remain in VMC if possible and contact the appropriate controlling agency.
        If possible, the aborting aircraft will remain clear until a landing can be made without interfer-
        ing with the remainder of the formation, or land on another runway.
        16.13.1.3.5. Lead Considerations:
            16.13.1.3.5.1. During close trail and echelon formation, wingmen maintain position
            strictly by a visual reference to the preceding aircraft. Because of this, it is essential that
            lead maintain a stable reference platform by flying constant power settings as much as pos-
            sible. Small climbs should be made by changing pitch and leaving power set. For climbs
            in excess of 500 feet, set power and adjust pitch as necessary to avoid obstacles. Using
            970 degrees C TIT is usually sufficient if climbs are started early. For descents in excess
            of 500 feet, set power not less than 5,000 inch-pounds torque and adjust pitch to maintain
            the desired airspeed or rate of descent. Under normal circumstances, lead should avoid
            using flight idle or maximum power settings, since they may outperform the ability of the
            wing aircraft. Throttle movement should be smooth and relatively slow to allow adjust-
            ments by wingmen.
            16.13.1.3.5.2. During fluid trail formation, climbs and descents should be made much the
            same as close trail. Small climbs should be made by changing pitch and leaving power set.
            For climbs in excess of 500 feet, set power and adjust pitch as necessary to avoid obstacles.
            Using 970 degrees C TIT is usually sufficient if climbs are started early. For descents in
            excess of 500 feet, set power not less than 5,000 inch-pounds torque and adjust pitch to
            maintain the desired airspeed or rate of descent. Like close trail, lead should be smooth
            with power changes, however, a greater range of high and low settings are available due to
            the spacing of the aircraft. The formation commander may brief alternate rates and power
            settings for fluid trail climbs and descents.
     16.13.1.4. Aircraft Lighting:
        16.13.1.4.1. Departure and Recovery. Use standard aircraft lighting unless there is an oper-
        ational need to do otherwise.
        16.13.1.4.2. En route. In the ATC environment, during other than actual combat operations,
        all aircraft not in a standard formation (standard formation is defined as less than 1 mile hori-
        zontal separation and less than 100 feet vertical, IAW FAA) will be fully lighted as required by
        AFI 11-202V3.
        16.13.1.4.3. Night Vision Goggles (NVGs). Refer to Table 16.7. for exterior and interior
        light settings when using NVGs. As a signal that the formation is changing to NVG lighting,
        lead aircraft will turn the top rotating beacon off 1 minute prior (3 min prior on non-SOFI air-
        craft) to turning exterior lights down to NVG settings (or as briefed). As a signal that the for-
        mation is changing to normal lighting, lead aircraft will turn on leading edge lights 1 minute
        prior to bringing all lights up (or as briefed).

NOTE:
When other than standard AFI 11-202V3 lighting is required due to mission constraints, Table 16.7. pro-
vides a quick reference for light configurations and light signals to be used during formation and helicop-
ter air refueling operations.

Table 16.7. Lighting Chart.
1. Day Formation. All aircraft will have lighting IAW AFI 11-202V3.
2. Night Formation. Without NVGs. All aircraft will have lighting IAW AFI 11-202V3.
3. Close Trail/Echelon Formation. Night, Using NVGs:
   a. Formation Lights Both, DIM/NVIS (30 percent)
   b. Navigation Lights OFF
   c. Anticollision/Strobe Lights OFF
   d. Pod and Hose Illumination Lights OFF
   e. Leading Edge Lights OFF
   f. Fuselage Lights OFF
   g. UARRSI Lights - OFF
4. Fluid Trail. Same as item 3 except, spacing and illumination may require higher formation
light setting. Notes: For training and exercise flights (with or without NVGs), the last aircraft in
the formation will be lighted IAW AFI 11-202V3. At night aircraft may turn off the pod and hose
illumination, leading edge and fuselage lights to aid night vision. During training and exercise
flights, all air craft will have lighting IAW AFI 11-202V3 when not in close/fluid trail or echelon
formation.
5. HC/MC130 Formation Signals From Lead:
   a. One Flash "I Assume Lead"
   b. Two Flashes "Number Two Assume Lead"
   c. Three Flashes "Number Three Assume Lead"
   d. Four Flashes "Go To Trail"
   e. Five Flashes "Crossover" or "Echelon"
   f. Six Flashes "Go IMC Trail"
6. HC/MC130 Formation Light Signals From Wingman:
   a. Two Flashes "Navigation Problem" (cannot assume the lead)
   b. Three Flashes "Power Problem" (may fall back, but can follow and refuel)
   c. Four Flashes "Aborting" (returning to base)
Notes:
1. Each flash per signal should be of one second duration, wait 5 seconds and repeat the entire
signal.
2. Signals are given out the paratroop door by flashlight/ALDIS lamp or aft door formation light
during echelon formation and with the tail navigation light during trail formation.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             245


3. Use a flashlight at night and the ALDIS lamp during the day.
4. If applicable, each wingman will pass on all signals while in trail or echelon.
5. If a wingman is observed breaking away from the formation without a signal, it will be
assumed that the problem is of such severity that an abort and return to base is required.
6. During tanker formation helo air refueling, one flash to the spare tanker indicates "Fuel Flow-
ing."
7. During tanker formation helo air refueling, two flashes from the cargo area to the spare tanker
indicates that the tanker giving the signal is unable to refuel and the spare take over that helo air
refueling. Retraction of the refueling hose(s) or acceleration away from the receiver(s) without
any signals requires the spare (if available) tanker becomes primary.
Note: Formations may vary lighting as necessary provided they maintain adequate visual identi
fication of the formation.
   16.13.2. Close Trail Formation Procedures. The close trail position may vary but will normally be
   flown with 200 to 500 feet horizontal distance between aircraft and belly to tail vertical clearance (see
   Figure 16.4.). The close trail formation can be used for entry and exit of an objective area at high
   speed and minimum altitude, and is particularly useful when maneuvering at very low altitude, in
   mountainous terrain, or inbound to a helicopter air refueling.

Figure 16.4. Close Trail Formation.




       16.13.2.1. Lead Changes. When necessary to change formation lead, use the following proce-
       dures. On command of the formation leader, the lead aircraft will maintain airspeed, altitude, and
246                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         heading. The #2 aircraft will increase airspeed by approximately 10 KIAS and move out to the
         right side of the formation (unless briefed otherwise) to provide sufficient wingtip clearance while
         moving abeam of lead. When the #2 aircraft passes and assumes lead position, the old lead will be
         appropriately notified (by verbal or light signal). The previous #3 aircraft will move out with the
         new lead to maintain the same relative position. The old lead falls back to his briefed position. If
         it is necessary to switch lead and two, while leaving three in his position, two will move up and to
         the right and the old lead will slide aft to trail on the new leader. Three must leave sufficient space
         for the preceding aircraft to maneuver. If this option is used it must be briefed, as it is the excep-
         tion to the rule. Using the same general procedures, the #3 aircraft can also become the lead by
         pulling out and ahead of the two aircraft in front. New order would then be #3, #1, #2. The signal
         to change these positions should be precise, e.g., "(Call Sign), #2, take lead," or use appropriate
         light signal. During a lead change, do not rejoin to the right echelon position.
         WARNING: There is a natural tendency to turn the aircraft in the direction a pilot is looking.
         During a position change, this causes a tendency for the aircraft to develop a vector towards each
         other. During position changes, closely monitor bank angle and closure with the other aircraft.

NOTE:
Lead changes should be done on a route segment where no turns or other maneuvers are required.
         16.13.2.2. Heading Changes. Formation leads will attempt to limit bank angles to 45 degrees
         unless terrain, airspace restrictions, or threat environment dictates otherwise.
         16.13.2.3. Altitude Changes. Lead will plan and execute descents to ensure terrain clearance for
         the last aircraft in the formation. Plan climbs to be within the performance capability of the most
         limited (by weight and power) aircraft.
      16.13.3. Alternate Formations. The threat environment will not always be conducive to the
      employment of standard close trail procedures. Alternate formation geometries optimize terrain
      masking and mutual support. The situation will very often require the transition from one geometry to
      another as the terrain and threat changes
         16.13.3.1. Fluid Trail. General guidance for flying Fluid Trail formation is contained in Chap-
         ter 8.
             16.13.3.1.1. Fluid trail is an extremely flexible formation, with the specifics of spacing and
             position left up to the formation commander. Distance between aircraft should be based upon
             terrain, threat, and visibility/illumination. Movement in the desired cone should also be tem-
             pered to allow maximum clearing and maneuverability by all aircraft. A position aft of the
             three-nine line allows the lead aircraft almost total freedom to maneuver as required. The fur-
             ther forward toward the three-nine line (line abeam) the wingmen are allowed to maneuver, the
             more restrictive they can be to the formation. Clearing in fluid trail is very different from close
             trail as wingmen must clear their individual flight path, since they are not flying the identical
             ground track as lead. Clearing for the formation is enhanced by the ability of the wingmen to
             clear through lead and aid in detection of traffic, threats, etc.
         16.13.3.2. Line Abeam. Line abeam is variant of fluid trail. It is utilized when crossing Lines of
         Communication (LOCs) or large flat, open areas. Line abeam should be a transient part of flying
         fluid trail. Movement forward as an LOC approaches and then movement back toward briefed
         fluid trail, once it has passed, is one possible use for this position.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                           247


      16.13.3.3. Echelon (See Figure 16.5.). Echelon is used during assembly, during recovery as an
      alternative to trail, and during formation AR. It is a position that should be used sparingly as it
      affords very little maneuverability. In the echelon formation, all wingmen are on the same side of
      the lead aircraft. Turns while in echelon are made away from wingmen, except for very small
      heading changes accomplished at small angles of bank. Echelon formation turns are accom-
      plished with wingmen stacked level at the same altitude while in the banked turn. Spacing during
      echelon can vary from a close, tight formation, to spread out separation during AR.
      WARNING: When flying these alternate formations, it may be necessary to modify inadvertent
      weather penetration procedures.

Figure 16.5. Echelon Formation.




   16.13.4. Miscellaneous Formation Procedures:
      16.13.4.1. Inadvertent Weather Penetration. This procedure is designed primarily for use from
      close trail formation during straight and level flight with no more than 3 aircraft. Specific proce-
      dures to be used with more aircraft or using other formations should be briefed using these proce-
      dures as a basis. Because of the clandestine nature of the mission and the need to operate at
      relatively low altitudes to remain undetected, formation lead must use all means available to avoid
      inadvertent weather penetration. However, inadvertent IMC can occur during night VFR forma-
      tion, especially when operating in marginal weather conditions on NVGs. If this occurs, the pri-
      mary concern of formation lead is to extricate the formation from the weather, provide safe aircraft
      separation and terrain clearance while minimizing the possibility of enemy detection. The follow-
      ing procedures and altitudes were designed for permissive threat areas. During operational mis-
      sions where the actual threat dictates, these altitudes may be lower as determined by thorough
      route study, nature of the terrain, navigational accuracy, and to what extent OPSEC outweighs
      safety. Upon entering marginal VMC or IMC, the following procedures apply:
248                                         AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


          16.13.4.1.1. Wing aircraft gives "(Call Sign)" then "IMC Break" three times over the primary
          interplane radio and immediately initiates a climbing turn as required for its position in the for-
          mation. The lead aircraft responds with call sign, heading and base altitude. Base altitude will
          be as follows: MSA, if position is within the MSA corridor; or ESA, if not.

NOTE:
During training and exercise operations, the IMC Break call will be made on a non-secure radio. Leads
response will be made on the same nonsecure radio by the Left Nav (unless briefed otherwise), and the
response should be called twice to ensure all wingmen copied the heading and altitude.
          16.13.4.1.2. All aircraft turn navigation lights to bright and turn transponder modes 1 and 3 to
          normal (if the threat environment allows).
          16.13.4.1.3. Lead aircraft sets TIT to 1010 degrees C (if necessary) and climbs at 180 KIAS
          straight ahead until reaching base altitude or VMC conditions, whichever occurs first. Upon
          reaching this altitude, maintain 180 KIAS.
          16.13.4.1.4. The #2 aircraft immediately turns right 10 degrees or more (if feasible), sets TIT
          at 1010 C (if necessary), and climbs at 170 KIAS to base altitude plus 500 feet or VMC condi-
          tions, whichever occurs first. After 30 seconds, resume original heading. Upon reaching alti-
          tude, maintain 180 KIAS.
          16.13.4.1.5. The #3 aircraft immediately turns left 10 degrees or more (if feasible), sets TIT at
          1010 C (if necessary), and climbs at 160 KIAS to base altitude plus 1,000 feet or VMC condi-
          tions, whichever occurs first. After 30 seconds, resume original heading. Upon reaching alti-
          tude, maintain 180 KIAS.
          16.13.4.1.6. If VMC conditions are reencounter and can be maintained, rejoin the formation
          visually.
          16.13.4.1.7. If still IMC at completion of the maneuver, continue on track using radar and
          air-to-air TACAN to maintain position until VMC is encountered. Recommended position of
          aircraft is in trail at 1 mile spacing. Lead may increase cruise airspeed after ensuring all air-
          craft have completed their climb. Accelerating helps keep the formation on time to its objec-
          tive and makes transition to IMC trail easier.
          WARNING: The direction of turn for IMC breaks is based on a "no terrain" situation. Ter-
          rain, threats or fluid trail position may dictate a direction of turn different from what your for-
          mation position calls for. Situational awareness is critical to terrain and threat avoidance when
          weather is inadvertently encountered.

NOTES:

              1. If the altitude to which the formation is climbing is only several hundred feet above en
                 route altitude, a lesser power setting may be appropriate. In cold weather conditions,
                 blindly setting 1010 C TIT can cause an overtorque. Remember, the climbing turn and
                 speed differential are what get the desired separation and the amount of power set
                 gives you the desired climb away from terrain.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                                 249


               2. All IMC maneuvering should be smooth and deliberate with reference to flight instru-
                  ments to prevent spatial disorientation.
       16.13.4.2. Preplanned Weather Penetration. These procedures are designed to permit forma-
       tion flight in IMC using radar and air-to-air TACAN to maintain position. Using these procedures,
       it is possible to fly an IMC route segment at a preplanned safe altitude while still maintaining for-
       mation integrity. These procedures can be used when adverse weather becomes a mission factor,
       and can enable weather penetration en route to a VMC objective area. Transmission security has
       been considered in formulating these procedures; however, there may be times when flight safety
       and the need to maintain formation integrity may outweigh security considerations. Under these
       conditions, interplane radio communication may be required.
           16.13.4.2.1. The following procedures are recommended to allow the formation to go from a
           close VFR position to an IFR position prior to entering weather while en route. On lead's sig-
           nal, lead accelerates 20 KIAS, #2 maintains en route airspeed, and #3 reduces speed 20 KIAS.
           The formation maintains this airspeed differential for 3 minutes, then resumes en route air-
           speed. This should establish approximately 1 mile separation between aircraft. On the same
           signal, lead maintains/climbs to base altitude, #2 climbs at 1,000 feet per minute to base alti-
           tude plus 500, and #3 climbs at 1,000 feet per minute to base altitude plus 1,000 feet. Base
           altitude will be as follows: MSA, if position is within the MSA corridor; ESA if outside the
           corridor, or an appropriate en route altitude if outside the low level environment.
       16.13.4.3. IFR Formation Position (IMC Trail):
           16.13.4.3.1. Recommended IMC Trail position is 1 mile in-trail, using radar and air-to-air
           TACAN to maintain position. If air-to-air TACAN is not operational, continuing with radar
           alone is permissible. Altitude separation should be 500 feet between aircraft. Lead aircraft
           will be at the base altitude, #2 at base altitude plus 500 feet, and #3 aircraft at base altitude plus
           1,000 feet. IMC Trail requires the lead aircraft to report all heading, altitude, and airspeed
           changes on interplane radio when operating in a permissive environment, or requires that these
           changes be thoroughly preplanned and flown precisely when operating in a hostile, comm-out
           environment. Depending on threat environment, altitudes may be amended (i.e., base plus 100
           feet, base plus 200 feet).
           16.13.4.3.2. If during mid/high level formation flight (e.g., deployment/redeployment) FAA/
           host nation airspace restrictions prevent a formation from using a block of altitudes, lead can
           direct the formation to maintain the same altitude. Lateral position will remain 1 mile in trail.
           If any wingmen lose radar contact, they must establish positive separation from the rest of the
           formation and obtain a separate clearance.

NOTE:
If difficulty is encountered in working an IFR clearance for the formation, a short term solution is to get a
single IFR clearance and have the #2 aircraft stack level at 1 mile in trail. This only works with a two ship
due to the constraints of a standard formation.
           16.13.4.3.3. Lead will signal resumption of VFR close trail position when visibility permits.
           Wingmen will accelerate as necessary on lead's signal to close to normal spacing. The forma-
           tion will rejoin per paragraphs 16.13.1.3.1. and 16.13.1.3.2.
       16.13.4.4. IFR Formation En Route (IMC Trail):
250                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


            16.13.4.4.1. Major en route heading changes should be prebriefed IAW the route flight plan.
            When feasible, lead should announce and signal the turn on interplane frequency. Wingmen
            will start timing on lead's signal, and based on their groundspeed, compute a delay to turn over
            the same point as lead. Twenty degrees of bank is recommended for lead.

NOTE:
A separate call for heading or altitude changes is not required if all aircraft are on the same ATC fre-
quency. Lead can acknowledge the heading or altitude change from the controller and end the transmis-
sion with "Hack" to indicate execution.
            16.13.4.4.2. As with heading changes, climbs and descents should be prebriefed IAW the
            route flight plan. En route climbs of less than 2,500 feet should be made at en route airspeed
            with lead setting power at 970 C TIT. For climbs of more than 2,500 feet, lead should set
            power at approximately 970 C TIT and use pitch to maintain flight manual climb airspeed. In
            a permissive environment, lead should call through each 2,000 feet of altitude to enable wing-
            men to maintain a constant relative altitude in the climb. The formation should maintain climb
            airspeed after level-off until all aircraft have time to reach altitude, then accelerate to en route
            airspeed.
            16.13.4.4.3. En route descents should be made at en route airspeed and 1,000 feet per minute
            with power as required to maintain this descent gradient. As with climbs, in a permissive envi-
            ronment, lead should call through each 2,000 feet.
            16.13.4.4.4. In a permissive environment, any wingman losing radar should immediately
            notify the formation commander and turn away from the formation heading and toward per-
            missive terrain. In a non-permissive environment, loss of systems while en route should be
            thoroughly covered in the formation briefing.
         16.13.4.5. IFR Formation Aborts and Emergencies. Aircraft aborting should advise the for-
         mation lead and formation commander and turn away from the formation. A minimum of 500 feet
         altitude separation should be obtained from the formation. If the lead aircraft loses its navigation
         capability but still has radar, it should advise #2 aircraft to assume lead, then turn away from the
         formation. If radar contact can be maintained, the aircraft may rejoin on the end of the formation.
         If it is #2 that aborts, #3 will move up to the #2 position.
         16.13.4.6. En route Radio Silence. Assume that the enemy has the capability to monitor, DF,
         and jam all communications. To avoid detection and compromise of the overall mission, missions
         must be planned and flown with little or no en route communications.
      16.13.5. Formation Air Refueling (AR) Procedures:
         16.13.5.1. General. The procedures in this section cover the most common options for AR, but
         can not cover every possible situation which may arise during refueling operations. The mission
         and formation commanders must be responsible for covering specific procedures unique to their
         operation. Reference T.O. 1-1C-1-29 for further guidance on formation air refueling.
            16.13.5.1.1. The preferred method of refueling is in VMC conditions utilizing close/fluid trail
            and loose visual positions (minimum 300 feet aft and 150 feet wingtip separation) throughout.
            When this is not possible, or, there is the potential for IMC conditions to impact operations, the
            Rendezvous and Intermittent IMC paragraphs cover procedures to be used.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             251


       16.13.5.2. Weather Minimums. Weather mins are IAW AFI 11-202V3 and the -29. Rendezvous
       closures will not be continued inside 1 NM unless visual contact is established with the tanker.
       AR will not be continued when weather conditions are deemed insufficient to safely complete
       refueling operations. The formation lead is responsible for weather avoidance until about 1/ 2 NM
       from contact at which point the tanker assumes that responsibility. Any aircraft in the formation
       may aid lead and the tanker in weather avoidance duties.
       16.13.5.3. Rendezvous:
           16.13.5.3.1. If IMC conditions must be penetrated en route to the AR track, the formation lead
           will direct the formation to execute a Preplanned Weather Penetration procedure. This will put
           the formation in IMC trail prior to climbing through IMC. The base altitude used for the pre-
           planned procedure should be called to place the highest receiver 1000 feet below refueling
           altitude. A lower base altitude may be initially called, however, you will then need to call for
           another climb to place the highest receiver 1000 feet below the refueling altitude. See Figure
           16.8.

NOTE:
Receivers should use formation interplane as much as possible prior to the refueling. This will help min-
imize any confusion if tanker common frequencies have multiple receivers using it.
           16.13.5.3.2. If IMC conditions still prevail at base altitude, the formation commander may
           direct the formation to IFR echelon as defined in the T.O. 1-1C-1-29. Wingmen will acknowl-
           edge this call. To move to IFR echelon, the #2 aircraft will turn right 10 degrees from base
           heading and move to 1 mile lateral spacing on the 60 degree line. The #3 aircraft will follow
           the preceding aircraft to the echelon line while remaining 1 mile in trail. This option is for
           only one tanker. If there are two tankers on the track, #3 will continue to an IFR echelon off
           #2. While the wingmen transition to echelon, lead should maintain heading and airspeed. See
           Figure 16.9. and Figure 16.10.
           16.13.5.3.3. If the mission or formation commander deems the weather to be insufficient to
           support IFR procedures, coordination for a different altitude or track will be necessary. If
           recoordination is necessary, the formation should be left in IMC trail for ease of maneuvering.
           WARNING: Attempting refueling operations in marginal weather conditions is a potentially
           hazardous situation and mission necessity must be weighed against the risk involved.
           16.13.5.3.4. The formation should plan to cross the ARIP or Entry Point at an altitude that
           places the highest receiver 1000 feet below the lowest tanker. A base altitude 2000 feet below
           refueling altitude will allow a three ship, in IMC trail, to place #3 1000 feet below refueling
           altitude.

NOTE:
In marginal weather conditions, a straight line refueling track (such as listed in A/P 1B) will minimize the
problems of turning in intermittent IMC conditions.
           16.13.5.3.5. If the climb to base or rendezvous altitude places the formation in definite VMC
           conditions, the formation leader may elect to close the formation back to close/fluid trail.
       16.13.5.4. Intermittent IMC Refueling Operations:
252                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


           16.13.5.4.1. When the tankers have been positively identified, lead will direct a climb to refu-
           eling altitude. All aircraft in the formation will climb to refueling altitude plus the altitude
           stack required for their IMC Trail position. The receivers are now in a position to commence
           refueling operations. From this position, the lead receiver will close and refuel per the -29.
           The second receiver per tanker will maintain echelon. The third receiver per tanker will main-
           tain trail off the preceding aircraft.
           16.13.5.4.2. During refueling operations, receivers will address themselves by formation call
           sign and position, ("King 91 lead", "King 91 #2"), etc.
           16.13.5.4.3. If a breakaway occurs, the receivers flying IFR echelon and IMC trail will ini-
           tially maintain position to allow the tanker and refueling receiver to safely maneuver away
           from each other.
           16.13.5.4.4. Once the onload has been completed and it is clear for the next receiver to move
           to the precontact position, each aircraft will call "Call sign/position, refueling complete." It is
           important that this call be delayed until approaching the post AR position. By delaying this
           call, you will insure the next aircraft does not start closing on the tanker until it is safe to do so.
       16.13.5.5. VMC Refueling Operations:
           16.13.5.5.1. Loose visual position expedites refueling operations. The formation commander
           should attempt to utilize loose visual whenever weather permits. Only one receiver at a time
           will fly loose visual off the tanker. Remaining receivers should fly close/fluid trail off the
           loose visual aircraft. For the formation commander to move wingmen from IFR echelon to
           loose visual, there must be at least two miles prevailing vis and weather that permits sustained
           visual contact with all aircraft. If an aircraft is moved from IFR echelon to loose visual, clo-
           sure with the tanker will be smooth and deliberate. Wingmen following in trail will also
           slowly close from 1 mile in trail to close trail. If weather or visibility do not permit this move-
           ment, notify lead immediately. See Figure 16.6. and Figure 16.7.
           16.13.5.5.2. When refueling with multiple tankers in VMC conditions, the wing aircraft will
           stay in close/fluid trail UNTIL lead begins his climb to the lead tanker. Once the climb toward
           precontact is initiated, the wingmen will move toward their assigned tanker. It is important
           that the formation stay in close/fluid trail until lead begins climbing because the last aircraft in
           the formation will be the only one carrying lights for the formation.
           16.13.5.5.3. Once initiating the climb toward the tanker, lead will come up on his lights.

NOTE:
In the loose visual position, the Nacelle Lights of the KC 135 can be very distracting, especially on NVGs.
The tanker can turn these lights down or off on request.
           16.13.5.5.4. If a breakaway occurs during refueling operations, the receiver flying loose
           visual (or in trail of the loose visual aircraft) will initially maintain their respective positions
           off the tanker to insure safe separation.
       16.13.5.6. Post Refueling Operations:
           16.13.5.6.1. Once onload has been completed and it is safe for the next receiver to move to
           precontact, each receiver will call using the formation call sign and their position, along with
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                                 253


           onload complete (King 91, #3 onload complete). If the weather is marginal, this call should be
           delayed until approaching the post air refueling position. The flight engineer will place the
           beavertail lights to DIM/FLASH for several seconds to notify the wingmen visually that the
           onload is complete and the aircraft is disconnecting.
           16.13.5.6.2. After completing the onload, move to the left side of the tanker. The position for
           post air refueling is dependent on the weather conditions on the track. In VMC conditions,
           lead will fly loose visual off the left side of the tanker. As the wingmen complete their
           onloads, they will move to trail off lead. If IMC conditions are a factor, lead will move to left
           IFR echelon and stack down to the base altitude used for the intermittent IMC rendezvous.
           Lead must stack down enough to allow the last refueler to be in his IMC trail position with
           1000 feet separation from refueling altitude. A base altitude 2000 feet below refueling altitude
           will allow a three ship to reform in IMC trail with 1000 feet between #3 and the tanker.
           WARNING: The IFR echelon position is far enough inside the turn of the tanker (if turning
           into you), that a large cutoff problem can develop. A good option available to the formation
           commander is, position the formation outside any potential turn during the refueling portion,
           and instead of reforming on the track after refueling, select a different point to remarshall the
           formation. A point near the next helo A/R track or near the low-level entry point may be
           appropriate.
           WARNING: There is a natural tendency to turn the aircraft in the direction you are looking.
           During movement off the tanker to assume a trail position, the potential exists for the aircraft
           to develop a vector towards lead. During this phase of flight, lead must fly a good loose visual
           position to allow immediate visual contact by the wing aircraft and wing aircraft must concen-
           trate on dropping straight back from the tanker prior to rejoining on lead.

NOTE:
In IMC conditions, keep in mind the limitations of the radar to paint aircraft at significantly different alti-
tudes from yours.
       16.13.5.7. Emergency Actions:
           16.13.5.7.1. Inadvertent IMC Entry in Loose Visual. If the formation enters IMC condi-
           tions with wingmen in loose visual formation, immediate separation of the aircraft is para-
           mount.
               16.13.5.7.1.1. In straight and level flight the loose visual aircraft will execute a turn away
               from the tanker using 15 degrees of bank for at least 15 degrees of heading change. If a
               third aircraft is in trail of the loose visual aircraft and loses sight of the preceding aircraft,
               turn using 30 degrees of bank for at least 30 degrees of turn for separation.
               16.13.5.7.1.2. For wingmen if outside the turn, roll wings level. If in trail of the loose
               visual aircraft and lose sight, roll 15 degrees of opposite bank for 15 degrees of turn.
               16.13.5.7.1.3. If inside the turn and IMC conditions are encountered, it is imperative that
               initial separation is established. Increase bank by 15 degrees and smoothly reduce power
               to ensure nose tail separation. If you have another aircraft in trail the power reduction
               MUST be gradual to allow the trail aircraft to go flight idle and begin nose tail separation.
               While bank is being established, a call to the tanker and potential breakaway aircraft to roll
254                                         AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


              wings level will aid in increasing separation. If in trail of the loose visual aircraft and lose
              sight, increase bank by 25 degrees and immediately reduce power to flight idle.
              WARNING: Entering the weather while in loose visual is extremely disorienting and an
              immediate transition to instruments is critical to reduce spatial disorientation. Descents
              from the wing should be tempered with the potential for a rapid descent to accelerate you
              in front of the tanker or receiver. This is especially important if inside the turn when IMC
              is encountered.

NOTE:
If the potential exists for IMC conditions to be encountered, send the wingmen to IFR echelon prior to
entering IMC if at all possible.
          16.13.5.7.2. Loss of Radar Equipment in IMC. If radar contact is lost in IMC conditions,
          and you do not have the preceding aircraft in sight, descend to the bottom of the block (or
          lower if practical) while maintaining the formations last heading and airspeed. As soon as
          possible, inform the formation of your position, equipment lost, and your follow on plan.

Section 16D—Hostile Environment Operations

16.14. Hostile Environment Operations:
   16.14.1. General. The tactics described in previous sections are based on combat principals with
   peacetime training safety restrictions. Variations of these and other standard airdrop procedures may
   be necessary to counter a particular threat, or to accomplish a particular mission. During actual com-
   bat operations, the mission commander will decide what specific tactics and modifications will be
   employed.

Section 16E—Tactical Approaches

16.15. General. Threat analysis, planning, and flexibility are key fctors in combat airland operations.
Plan your route to avoid the threat, if possible.
   16.15.1. Each approach offers advantages and disadvantages. The selected approach should avoid
   the threat. If this is not possible, reduce aircraft exposure time as much as possible using the proper

      altitude, airspeed, and flight path. When more than one aircraft is involved, using multiple routes,
      altitudes, and traffic patterns may hamper targeting efforts by the enemy. The entry, slowdown, and
      traffic pattern should allow a successful landing on the first attempt, but leave adequate margins for
      the unexpected.
      16.15.2. Planning cannot be overemphasized. Analyze environmental factors such as altitude winds,
      visibility, and weather phenomena, and take full advantage of terrain. Also, consider decision points,
      emergency escape plans, and alternate approaches. Decision points are times, positions, or events that
      should commit you to one course of action. Having emergency escape plans and an alternate course
      of action available will enhance survival by making the decision process easier in the confusion of
      battle.
      16.15.3. Hostile activity, weather, aircraft weight, or terrain may require significant modifications to
      normal traffic patterns. The following paragraphs provide examples and techiques; however, pilot
      ingenuity, proficiency, and judgment are keys in determining the type of approach to fly. Normal
      habit patterns should be used as much as possible when flying these approaches. Regardless of the
      type of approach, you should enter a point on final no less than one-quarter of a mile from the touch-
      down zone, intercepting a normal glide path.
      16.15.4. Maneuvering Restrictions:
         16.15.4.1. Stall speeds for 45 and 60 degrees of bank (clean) will be checked prior to accomplish-
         ing random shallow approaches. (NOTE: 60-degree bank stall speed is equal to 1.4 times wings
         level stall speed.) Adhere to the following Flight Manual restrictions:
             16.15.4.1.1. 60 degrees of bank maximum.
             16.15.4.1.2. 45 degrees of bank maximum with any flaps extended.
             16.15.4.1.3. Two (2) Gs maximum with any flaps extended.
             16.15.4.1.4. 145 KIAS maximum (100 percent flaps).

16.16. Low Altitude Approaches. These approaches are used primarily when a low altitude ingress is
necessary. All maneuvering is done at low altitude. These approaches can be entered from any direction
at en route altitude and airspeed. Fly these approaches in accordance with the guidance contained in
AFTTP 3-1, Tactical Employment (applicable C-130 volume).

16.17. High Altitude Approaches. These approaches are used primarily when a high or medium altitude
ingress is necessary (e.g., small arms environment and a permissive high or medium altitude threat envi-
ronment exists), thus allowing some reconnaissance of the field as you fly over. Initial altitude, airspeed,
and heading are based on the threat. Fly these approaches in accordance with the guidance contained in
AFTTP 3-1 (applicable C-130 volume).

16.18. Unimproved/Short Field Landings:
      16.18.1. Some "considerations" when accomplishing tactical approaches into hostile or austere loca-
      tions include:
         16.18.1.1. RCR Determination. An accurate RCR is highly desirable for any short field landing.
         The STT lacks sufficient equipment to provide this information and the majority of training is
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                           261


     accomplished on asphalt or dry, compacted dirt. The RCR values in Chapter 5 of this volume are
     useful for estimating distance required for stopping.
     16.18.1.2. Determining Touchdown Point. The ability to judge exactly where to touch down
     comes with experience. Seat height; flare height; runway surface, length and width; and assult
     zone marking will all provide illusions which may affect the pilot's ability to accurately judge the
     touchdown point. As a technique, simply counting seconds will provide fairly accurate distances.
     For example, at 105 KIAS in a no wind situation, the aircraft is traveling 175 ft per second. If the
     assult zone is poorly marked or not at all, begin counting over the threshold.
         16.18.1.2.1. At the end of 2 to 3 seconds, the aircraft will have traveled 350 to 525 ft and
         touchdown at this point will be in "the zone" (remember the aft main gear is approximately
         42.5 ft back). If the touchdown is past the marked zone, begin counting when abeam the end
         of the zone to determine whether sufficient stopping distance remains. To avoid "mental cal-
         culations" during this critical period, compute the distances based on seconds while on final.
         16.18.1.2.2. As a technique, 200 ft per second will provide an acceptable safety margin. For
         example, if the landing is on a 4,000 ft strip, there will be 3,000 ft remaining if the touchdown
         is made at the end of the zone. This allows a safe landing for a computed ground roll of 2,000
         ft. If the landing is 3 seconds past the zone, there will be 2,900 ft remaining. Although current
         procedures demand a go-around in the event of a long landing, remember what effect a
         go-around and subsequent traffic pattern may have in a hostile environment.
  16.18.2. Markings. LZs are normally marked with VS-17 marker panels, omnidirectional visible
  lighting systems and, if required, strobe lights. However, virtually any type of overt lighting or mark-
  ing system is acceptable if all participating units are briefed and concur in its use.
     16.18.2.1. Combat control units may also use specialized clandestine (IR) lighting systems (AFI
     13-217). Specific details will be agreed upon at the joint planning conferences concerning the
     type and location of LZ markings as well as airfield identification procedures. Considerations will
     be given to existing international agreements. This information will be a special subject at the
     final briefing to ensure that all required ground and aircrew members thoroughly understand the
     LZ recognition and identification procedures.
     16.18.2.2. Conventional LZ markings consistent with flying safety will be used. When landings
     can be anticipated at both ends of the LZ, the first portion of each end will be marked as the
     approach end (see AFI 13-217 for further LZ marking considerations and airfield marking pat-
     terns).
  16.18.3. Authentication. Radio-out authentication is normally accomplished by the aircraft arriving
  at the proper time on a predetermined track and the runway team flashing or displaying the proper
  code letter of the day (if applicable). Normal means of authentication include transmission of chal-
  lenge and response codes, use of chattermark tables, light signals, IFF interrogation, etc.

                                SEARCH AND RESCUE PROCEDURES

Section 17A—Search and Rescue Procedures

17.1. General. Most searches are part of an effort to save life; therefore, make every effort to complete
the search as rapidly and efficiently as possible. A thorough scan of the search area and accurate naviga-
tion significantly increase the probability of detection. Reactions to sightings must be timely and accu-
rate. This section outlines operational procedures for conducting effective searches in the C-130 aircraft.
Refer to the National SAR Manual Vol I/II for additional information.

17.2. Communications with a Distressed Aircraft:
      17.2.1. Establish direct communications with the distressed aircraft as soon as possible. Accomplish
      this on the distressed aircraft's HF en route frequency, emergency VHF or UHF frequency, or any
      other frequency used by the distressed aircraft to alert air or ground facilities. The primary method of
      communications will be VHF or UHF when positive contact is made (Table 17.1.).
      17.2.2. Communications procedures should instill confidence in the distressed crew so they will
      know professional assistance is at hand. The crew will achieve this goal by employing the following:
         17.2.2.1. Coordinate immediate action items first and supplemental items as the mission
         progresses. Communications may be lost or the distressed crew may be forced to bail out, crash
         land, or ditch.
         17.2.2.2. Avoid long transmissions and provide pertinent data at periodic intervals to assure the
         distressed crew that contact is being maintained.
         17.2.2.3. Make all messages clear and concise. Know what to say and use a tone of confidence.
         17.2.2.4. If direct communications are delayed or fail completely, relay pertinent data and instruc-
         tions through any air or ground station in contact with both aircraft.
         17.2.2.5. If all efforts to contact the distressed aircraft fail, transmit pertinent information and
         instructions in the blind, assuming the distressed aircraft is receiving but unable to acknowledge.
      17.2.3. Use the following frequencies and procedures during an intercept:
         17.2.3.1. Primary Frequency. The HF, VHF, or UHF en route frequency used by the distressed
         aircraft to alert air or ground stations and to request intercept.
         17.2.3.2. Secondary Frequency. Designate a secondary HF frequency shortly after initial con-
         tact. Instruct the distressed aircraft to change to this frequency if contact on the primary frequency
         is lost for a 10-minute period. When VHF or UHF contact is established, designate a secondary
         frequency. Prior to changing VHF or UHF frequencies, instruct the distressed aircraft to return to
         primary if contact cannot be established within 30 seconds.
      17.2.4. Initial Communications Procedures:
         17.2.4.1. Attempt initial contact with distressed aircraft before takeoff or as soon as practical on
         HF, VHF, or UHF. If initial contact is on HF, designate a VHF or UHF frequency to monitor. If
         initial contact is on VHF or UHF, instruct distressed aircraft to monitor en route HF frequency.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              263


       17.2.4.2. Identify yourself and advise that you are en route to intercept.
       17.2.4.3. Instruct the distressed crew to use the present frequency as primary and not to break
       contact. Designate a secondary frequency.

UHF - GCI and Guard
VHF-FM - 156.8 MHz (153.8 MHz for mountain areas)
Note: These are suggested radio setups. Actual frequencies used will be determined by the search objec-
tive, crew, and availability of radio equipment.
       17.2.4.4. Instruct the distressed crew to transmit "emergency" on the IFF.
       17.2.4.5. Obtain and evaluate the latest position, time, magnetic heading, IAS, GS, altitude, fuel
       remaining, personnel on board, and flight conditions of the distressed aircraft.
       17.2.4.6. Verify the nature of emergency and intentions of the distressed aircraft.
       17.2.4.7. If required, instruct the distressed aircraft to home on the signal transmitted by the res-
       cue aircraft.
       17.2.4.8. Transmit supplemental data as appropriate to the situation such as altimeter setting,
       weather, estimated time to intercept (ETI), minimum safe altitude, etc.

17.3. Lost Aircraft Procedures. Fixing, intercepting, and escorting a lost aircraft is an extremely diffi-
cult problem. Establish communications with the lost aircraft in order to initiate orientation procedures.
Use all possible aids to locate the approximate position of the lost aircraft. In many cases, radar or direc-
tion finding stations will establish a bearing from the station to the lost aircraft and indicate the general
direction to fly to accomplish an intercept.
264                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


      17.3.1. Attempt contact with the lost aircraft as soon as possible. Climb to the highest practical alti-
      tude to increase communications range.
      17.3.2. If the lost aircraft is in contact with an air or ground station within reasonable range from the
      base, the rescue aircraft should orbit at altitude over the appropriate station until some clue is received
      which indicates the general direction or position of the lost aircraft.
      17.3.3. If all communication attempts prove unsuccessful, it is advisable to proceed in the most logi-
      cal direction toward the lost aircraft.
      17.3.4. Instruct the distressed aircraft to maintain radio contact at all costs and orbit at its present
      position to keep within communications range, maintaining the highest practical altitude to improve
      communications.
      17.3.5. Ascertain amount of fuel remaining and the number of personnel aboard.
      17.3.6. Maintain communications with air or ground stations capable of providing bearings, fixes, or
      other assistance.
      17.3.7. Use every possible intercept method and electronic aid to ensure a successful mission.
         17.3.7.1. Employ the electronic aid that can provide the quickest and most reliable bearing or fix
         on the lost aircraft.
         17.3.7.2. Obtain a reliable bearing or fix and instruct the lost aircraft to leave orbit and head
         toward the rescue aircraft or the nearest suitable landing area.
         17.3.7.3. If in voice contact with the lost aircraft and unable to establish a bearing or fix, deter-
         mine its approximate position from any surface objects, landmarks, or peculiar cloud formation.
         Landing lights and pyrotechnic flares improve detection capabilities at night.
      17.3.8. Lost Plane Fixing Procedures (Figure 17.1.). If the situation demands the lost airplane to
      land as soon as possible, determine its position and vector it to the nearest airfield as follows:
         17.3.8.1. Request the lost aircraft to orbit (360-degree turns) at its present position. Take HF,
         VHF, or UHF radio bearing from the distressed aircraft and plot it.
         17.3.8.2. Fly perpendicular to the bearing obtained for 5 minutes. Take and plot a second bearing.

NOTE:
Expect the lost aircraft to drift considerably if there are high winds in the orbit area.
         17.3.8.3. The point where the two bearings cross is the approximate position of the lost aircraft.
         Compute the distance to the lost aircraft by:
                                                 TAS X Minutes Flown
                                                    Bearing Change
         17.3.8.4. The fixing procedure will work in reverse; i.e., the rescue aircraft may orbit and take
         bearings on the lost aircraft while it flies a constant heading. Use this reverse procedure only as a
         last resort.
         17.3.8.5. Prior to vectoring a distressed aircraft in any direction, it is imperative to obtain a rea-
         sonably accurate position and ensure that the lost aircraft's altitude clears all terrain by a safe mar-
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                           265


      gin. Then relay the bearing, distance, and ETA to the closest airfield. Use an appropriate intercept
      course and monitor the progress of the lost aircraft.

Figure 17.1. Lost Airplane Fixing Procedures.




17.4. Aircrew Search Briefings:
   17.4.1. Prior to dispatch on a search mission, the entire crew will receive formal and complete brief-
   ings in accordance with this volume. EXCEPTION: When the urgency of the situation compels the
   crew to scramble, the duty controller will brief the aircraft commander and navigator while the rest of
   the crew completes necessary aircraft inspections.
   17.4.2. The aircraft commander will brief and discuss with the crew the procedures and crew duties
   for the mission. The discussion will include:
      17.4.2.1. Objective of the search.
      17.4.2.2. Planning the search.
      17.4.2.3. Position reporting.
      17.4.2.4. Preparation of personnel and equipment for airborne delivery.
      17.4.2.5. Preparation of flares and smoke signals.
      17.4.2.6. Sighting procedures.
      17.4.2.7. Feasibility of using night vision goggles (NVGs).
      17.4.2.8. Use of IDS/FLIR (some airplanes) during search.

      17.4.3. Prior to beginning any low level search, complete the Search and Rescue Airdrop Checklist.

17.5. Planning the Search. The pilot, in close coordination with the navigator, will evaluate the situation
for search coverage required, appropriate method of search, type of search pattern required, altitude, air-
speed, and track spacing.
      17.5.1. Consider many factors when determining appropriate search procedures for a specific mis-
      sion. Several are:
         17.5.1.1. Weather conditions.
         17.5.1.2. Terrain characteristics if over land.
         17.5.1.3. Sea conditions if over water.
         17.5.1.4. Time of search, i.e. daylight or darkness.
         17.5.1.5. Survivor's signaling aids.
         17.5.1.6. Objective size, shape, color contrast with surroundings, and amount of freeboard.
         17.5.1.7. Status of objective; overdue, lost, crashed, or ditched.
         17.5.1.8. Estimated location of objective. When accurate position information is not available,
         you will most likely find the objective along the intended track from the last known position
         (LKP) to the intended destination, and within a reasonable distance on either side of this track.
         17.5.1.9. Endurance of search aircraft.
      17.5.2. Methods of Search. The three basic methods of aerial search are visual, radar, and elec-
      tronic.
         17.5.2.1. Visual search is the primary method for day or night missions. Crews will use proce-
         dures outlined in this section for the most effective results.
         17.5.2.2. Radar search is the primary method of search when visibility prevents an effective
         visual search and the objective will provide a recognizable radar target.
         17.5.2.3. Use an electronic search when searching for survivors or aircraft with transceivers and
         radio beacons. Electronic search consists of monitoring distressed or preplanned beacon frequen-
         cies and searching for IFF transponder signals. Aircrew members will monitor applicable distress
         frequencies at all times while on search missions, except when making required transmissions.
      17.5.3. Intensity of Coverage. Determine the intensity of search coverage by the size of the area to
      be searched, number of aircraft available for search, and probability of finding the objective. Provide
      search coverage as follows:
         17.5.3.1. Use preliminary search coverage during the initial phases of a mission and during all
         night or electronic searches. This type coverage permits rapid and reasonably thorough coverage
         of the primary area. During this phase, assume you will easily sight or contact the search objec-
         tive. Fly route, parallel, or creeping line search patterns at higher altitudes, faster airspeeds, and
         greater track spacing.
         17.5.3.2. Use concentrated search coverage during the maximum effort phase of a mission, or
         when attempting to locate a sighting or objective whose location is fairly well known. This type
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              267


     coverage ensures an area is thoroughly searched. Fly expanding square, parallel, creeping line, or
     sector search patterns at lower altitudes, slower airspeeds, and with smaller track spacing.
  17.5.4. Selection of Search Area and Search Pattern. The crew will select the search area and
  employ search patterns most likely to succeed in locating the objective. Location and size of the
  search area and the employment of search patterns is dependent upon the most probable position of
  the incident or survivors, taking into account previously mentioned factors. Determine the most
  probable position of a distress incident by a fix, position report at the time of an incident, or dead reck-
  oning estimated from the LKP. Consider the movement of the object (parachute drift, raft drift, etc.)
  when establishing the search pattern.
  17.5.5. Select an Appropriate Search Pattern. Refer to National SAR Manual Volume I/II for
  additional patterns. (Figure 17.2. through Figure 17.7.).
     17.5.5.1. Route Search. Employ the route search when the only available lead is a LKP or dead
     reckoning position and the intended track of the search objective. This usually is the first search
     employed. Assume the objective is on or adjacent to its intended track, and that the search objec-
     tive will be easily discernible or possesses electronic detection aids.
     17.5.5.2. Parallel Search. Use a parallel search to cover large rectangular areas where the objec-
     tive is expected to be between two points and possibly off track due to navigation error. Employ
     this simultaneously with or immediately after completion of a route search. Also, use a parallel
     search during concentrated searches since navigational accuracy is increased when long search
     legs are used.
     17.5.5.3. Creeping Line Search. When several aircraft are available, use a creeping line version
     of the parallel search in conjunction with or immediately after a route search. In addition, substi-
     tute the creeping line search for an expanding square search during concentrated coverage when
     time is not an urgent factor. It is more accurate and provides the same coverage as a square pat-
     tern.
     17.5.5.4. Expanding Square Search. Use the expanding square search for concentrated search
     of a small area where a sighting or search objective has been reported.
     17.5.5.5. Sector Search. Use the sector search when the position of distress is known within
     close limits and the search area is not extensive. It provides greater navigational accuracy,
     increased scanning opportunity, and is more flexible than the expanding square.
     17.5.5.6. Contour Search. Use the contour search in mountains or hilly terrain.
  17.5.6. Track Spacing. Carefully establish track spacing; it should never be greater than twice the
  visual detection range. By decreasing track spacing, the probability of detection is increased at the
  expense of time required to search a given area. The limit to which you can reduce track spacing is
  proportional to the limits of accuracy of navigation by search units. Optimum track spacing permits
  maximum expectation of target detection consistent with economic employment of search units. Gen-
  erally, track spacing is greater during preliminary search than during concentrated search. Use sweep
  width for average conditions (Table 17.2. through Table 17.5.) as a basis to establish track spacing.
  Individuals in life jackets are almost impossible to detect unless they have signaling devices; use a
  detection range of 1/2 nautical mile under these circumstances. A rule of thumb for determining track
  spacing is: expected visual detection range times two equals track spacing.

      17.5.7. Search Altitude. Select an optimum search altitude based upon the object of search, weather
      in the search area, electronic or visual location aids used, and any other known factor which would
      affect the search altitude. Generally, the lower the search altitude, the better the chance of seeing an
      object, provided the altitude is not so low that the aircraft speed becomes detrimental. During prelim-
      inary searches, the altitude will be higher to detect possible signals at greater distances. Recommend
      altitudes in Table 17.6. when other known factors permit their use.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                               273

   17.5.8. Search Speed. During preliminary searches, fly the aircraft at a speed that permits rapid cov-
   erage of the search area yet allows scanners an opportunity to detect large objects, signals, or wreck-
   age. An optimum airspeed under these circumstances is 200 knots IAS. During concentrated search,
   fly the aircraft at airspeeds based on aircraft gross weight as depicted in the Aircraft Performance
   Manual. Conduct electronic searches at cruising speed unless otherwise directed.

17.6. Search Procedures:
   17.6.1. Rescue missions often involve commitment based upon calculated risks. Give full consider-
   ation to all safety factors. Timely reaction to all search missions is essential to the safety of personnel
   or equipment. Do not jeopardize safety by inadequate preparation or short cuts to expedite takeoff, or
   arrival at search areas. For search missions use the Pre-Search Checklist contained in paragraph
   17.12. Aircrews will comply with all other applicable directives which govern their duties, such as:
       17.6.1.1. Accomplish complete predeparture flight planning except for scramble missions. On
       scramble missions, complete essential flight planning prior to and shortly after takeoff.
274                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         17.6.1.2. Use in-flight procedures in accordance with the appropriate theater of operation flight
         regulations. Search aircraft may be operated below minimum altitudes and visibilities under the
         provisions of AFI 11-202V3 and Chapter 6.
             17.6.1.2.1. Aircraft will maintain vertical and horizontal separation in the search area. This is
             critical when several aircraft are searching within close proximity.
             17.6.1.2.2. Transmit operation normal (position) reports as required by the controlling agency.
             17.6.1.2.3. Use appropriate call signs.
      17.6.2. The following general instructions apply to all search missions:
         17.6.2.1. Brief crewmembers who did not attend the operations briefing on the purpose of the
         mission.
         17.6.2.2. Scanners who are not aircrew members will receive a briefing on the search objective.
         17.6.2.3. The aircraft commander will supervise and coordinate activities of crewmembers during
         preparation for search, as follows:
             17.6.2.3.1. Plan the search with the navigator(s).
             17.6.2.3.2. Discuss with all crewmembers scanning procedures.
             17.6.2.3.3. Discuss with the navigator(s) and copilot the procedures for making search pattern
             turns.
             17.6.2.3.4. Discuss the radio communication procedures with the ACS and copilot (Table
             17.1.).
             17.6.2.3.5. Discuss the preparation of flares, sea dyes, and smoke signals for deployment with
             the loadmaster.
             17.6.2.3.6. Discuss the preparation of personnel and equipment for airborne delivery with the
             loadmaster and pararescuemen. Ensure all crewmembers are thoroughly familiar with the
             checklists to be used for various airborne delivery options.
         17.6.2.4. The aircraft commander will coordinate crewmember activities during prosecution of
         the search by:
             17.6.2.4.1. Ensuring completion of the Search and Rescue Airdrop Checklist prior to com-
             mencing any low level search.
             17.6.2.4.2. Alerting the scanners to begin scanning when approaching the search area.
             17.6.2.4.3. Directing crewmember to put on their LPUs prior to descending below 2,000 feet
             over water.
             17.6.2.4.4. Checking with crewmembers to ensure all equipment and personnel are ready for
             action in the event of a sighting.
             17.6.2.4.5. Making periodic checks of fuel remaining to ensure sufficient fuel remains for
             return to home station.
         17.6.2.5. Report all deviations from assigned search procedures to the on-scene commander or
         mission commander.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                         275


     17.6.2.6. Thoroughly investigate sightings and report findings immediately. Initiate recovery
     action or assistance when the survivors are located and inform appropriate agencies of the
     progress.
     17.6.2.7. The navigator(s) will:
         17.6.2.7.1. Maintain an accurate record of area searched.
         17.6.2.7.2. Direct the aircraft to ensure proper coverage of the search area.
         17.6.2.7.3. Continually cross check headings, drift, time, airspeed, and altitude to maintain
         the best possible search coverage.
         17.6.2.7.4. Use a large scale chart when searching over land to ensure terrain and obstacle
         clearance. Use a search pattern graph as a suitable reference while searching over water.
         17.6.2.7.5. Record sighting information on log and plot position on navigation chart.
         17.6.2.7.6. Monitor equipment during radar and electronic searches.
         17.6.2.7.7. Debrief controlling agency with an accurate depiction of any areas searched.
         17.6.2.7.8. When other aircraft are involved, with the assistance of the ACS, track and assign
         search areas for other aircraft.
     17.6.2.8. The ACS will maintain radio communications with other search aircraft and the control-
     ling agency as directed by the aircraft commander.
     17.6.2.9. The loadmaster will assume supervision of the scanners and will schedule rotation and
     rest periods.
     17.6.2.10. All crewmembers will assist with the scanning duties when possible.
     17.6.2.11. When a search is completed with negative results, consider searching the area again.
     Normally, position subsequent search legs between or 45 degrees to the previous search legs. This
     procedure, in effect, results in smaller track spacing.
  17.6.3. In the search area:
     17.6.3.1. Descend to search altitude (Table 17.6.).
     17.6.3.2. Have navigator obtain the wind at search altitude. To visually cover the area thoroughly,
     slow the airspeed during search patterns (refer to the Aircraft Performance Manual).
     17.6.3.3. Notify ATC of arrival on scene and estimated endurance.
     17.6.3.4. Vector other aircraft to the scene.
     17.6.3.5. Use radar (some life rafts carry reflectors).
     17.6.3.6. Assume on-scene command until relieved by another duly appointed SAR aircraft. As
     other aircraft arrive, do the following:
         17.6.3.6.1. Establish contact on channels other than Guard.
         17.6.3.6.2. Obtain aircraft type identification, endurance, and rescue capability.
         17.6.3.6.3. Assign altimeter setting, frequencies, search areas, patterns, and altitude separa-
         tion.
276                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         17.6.3.7. If leaving the search area because of lack of fuel, assign another aircraft as on-scene
         commander.
      17.6.4. Determine an accurate wind prior to and throughout the search by SCNS, INS, Doppler, or
      wind plottage. To determine wind direction and velocity by plottage, the following apply:
         17.6.4.1. Crestlines of waves on the surface of the water are perpendicular to the direction of the
         wind. Ripples and bow waves break away from the wind (downwind). The foam of whitecaps
         formed by breaking waves always appear to slide into the wind (upwind).
         17.6.4.2. There may be streaks in the water parallel to the wind direction. These streaks are called
         wind lanes.
         17.6.4.3. Turn aircraft so its longitudinal axis is aligned with the direction of movement of rip-
         ples, whitecaps, waves, or wind streaks.
         17.6.4.4. Read compass to determine magnetic direction of wind or its reciprocal (convert to true
         values, if necessary).
         17.6.4.5. Determine the direction in which ripples, waves, or whitecaps are moving to obtain
         actual direction of wind.
         17.6.4.6. Determine wind velocity by observing the appearance of the surface (Table 17.7.).
      17.6.5. When flying search patterns, turns must be accurate and uniform as possible. The following
      procedures are provided to assist the aircrew in making precise turns:
         17.6.5.1. Fly the aircraft on autopilot when possible.
         17.6.5.2. Prior to starting the pattern, the navigator will brief the crew on the direction and rate of
         turn and the turn command procedure used.
         17.6.5.3. Normally, all turns are standard rate (3 degrees per second) unless track spacing is less
         in distance than the diameter of a standard turn at a given speed. In this situation, continue turn to
         180 degrees and adjust turn rate as required to remain within the pattern.
         17.6.5.4. On any search pattern employing a succession of 90-degree standard rate turns sepa-
         rated by cross legs, use the following procedure for computing time to begin each turn:
             17.6.5.4.1. Compute time required to fly entire first leg using ground speed for that leg.

        17.6.5.4.5. Subtract 8 seconds from time computed in paragraph 17.6.5.4.4.
        17.6.5.4.6. Add the difference obtained in paragraph 17.6.5.4.5. to start search time. Result-
        ant will be the time to begin the first 90-degree turn.
        17.6.5.4.7. To compute ensuing turn times, continue to subtract 8 seconds from successive
        full leg time and add the resultant to previous turn time.
     17.6.5.5. Search Pattern Execution:
        17.6.5.5.1. Route Search. Route search consists of one search leg along a given track. Nor-
        mally, start the search leg at a point nearest the search aircraft's departure and search along the
        route of flight between the LKP and the intended destination. If the LKP is a position report,
        search between the LKP and the report where the next report was due. Extend the track
        approximately 25 NM to allow for navigational error on the part of the missing aircraft.
        17.6.5.5.2. Parallel Search (Figure 17.2. and Figure 17.3.). Use the parallel search to cover
        an area on each side of the search objectives intended track or an assigned rectangular area
        beginning on the corners. This pattern is a series of parallel legs (tracks) advancing from one
        side of an area to the other. The longer search legs will parallel the search objective's intended
278                                   AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


      track or the long side of a rectangular search area. The short legs (cross legs) of a parallel
      search will be equal to track spacing.
      17.6.5.5.3. Creeping Line Search (Figure 17.4. and Figure 17.6.):
         17.6.5.5.3.1. The creeping line search is a series of parallel tracks advancing along a given
         track. The longer legs are perpendicular to the given track and are sufficient in length to
         allow for navigational error or drift of the search objective. The cross legs of a creeping
         line search will be equal to track spacing.
         17.6.5.5.3.2. Use the creeping line search pattern to cover an area on both sides of the
         search objective's intended track during and after route searches. Begin the pattern at one
         end of the intended track or at an assigned point along the track.
         17.6.5.5.3.3. During concentrated search coverage, begin at the nearest corner and use the
         creeping line search to cover an assigned rectangular pattern.
      17.6.5.5.4. Expanding Square Search (Figure 17.7.):
         17.6.5.5.4.1. The expanding square search is a series of search legs which expand outward
         forming a square pattern. The first and second legs are equal in length to track spacing and
         each two succeeding legs are increased in length by a distance equal to track spacing. Legs
         are flown at right angles and all turns are made to the right.
         17.6.5.5.4.2. Begin the search at the center point of the area of highest probability. Nor-
         mally, this pattern will not cover an area over 20 NM square. To minimize navigational
         error, plan for upwind-downwind and crosswind legs. Use cardinal headings if the wind is
         negligible or time does not permit adequate planning.
      17.6.5.5.5. Sector Search (Figure 17.5.):
         17.6.5.5.5.1. The sector search is a series of legs which originates from a datum point. The
         resulting close track spacing increases probability of detection near the datum point (cen-
         ter) and larger track spacing at the extremities. Each long leg is equal to the diameter of
         the area where the objective is most likely to be found and the cross legs are equal to com-
         puted track spacing.
         17.6.5.5.5.2. Begin at the datum point. Drop a smoke or other suitable reference marker
         over the datum point to facilitate precise search legs. Drop additional markers as required
         throughout the pattern. When planning the search, align the first leg with the search objec-
         tive's direction of movement, drift, or with the most expeditious heading and make all
         turns to the right.
         17.6.5.5.5.3. Determine the heading of the succeeding leg using the information shown in
         Table 17.8. Each successive leg is determined by adding 90 degrees, plus the angle
         change (0) to the previous leg.
      17.6.5.5.6. Contour Search (Figure 17.8. and Figure 17.9.):
         17.6.5.5.6.1. Use the contour search to search mountainous or hilly terrain. Fly search
         legs around a peak or back and forth along the side of the mountain, depending upon the
         size and accessibility of the search area. As one contour circuit or leg is completed, nor-
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            279


              mally decrease the altitude 500 feet and commence a new leg. Make turns away from the
              mountain during descent at the end of each leg when searching the side of the mountain.

              17.6.5.5.6.2. The navigator will use the largest possible terrain contour chart (JOG or
              TPC) available. Mark the areas searched thoroughly for debriefing with the controlling
              agency.
              17.6.5.5.6.3. Start searching above the highest peak or ridge. Use extreme care during the
              search. Do not search when terrain conditions, high winds, turbulence, visibility. or
              weather conditions create a hazard to safe flight.
              17.6.5.5.6.4. The pilot flying the aircraft will devote full attention to evaluating forward
              terrain for clearance and hazards to flight.
              17.6.5.5.6.5. All crewmembers will be especially watchful for power lines, cables, etc.

             17.6.5.5.6.6. Evaluate the area for turbulence and down drafts before descending to search
             altitude and flying close to a mountain side, as severe down drafts (2000 feet per minute
             and greater) may occur. Do not fly where winds exceed 25 knots.
             17.6.5.5.6.7. Search from top to bottom, never from bottom to top. Search 500 feet above
             and away from the terrain at all times, never closer.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                               281


              17.6.5.5.6.8. Exercise extreme caution when searching in canyons and valleys. Ensure
              adequate clearance before entering the area. Always maintain an "out." Plan ahead of the
              aircraft and know which way to turn in an emergency.
              17.6.5.5.6.9. The aircraft commander will ensure all loose equipment is securely fastened
              or tied down during mountain searches. Crewmembers will be strapped in if duties permit.

17.7. Sighting Procedures:
   17.7.1. When a sighting is made, the appropriate crewmember will notify the rest of the crew over
   interphone and indicate the position of the sighting by using the clock system; e.g., "Pilot, right scan-
   ner, target sighted at 4 o'clock, 500 yards."
   17.7.2. Immediately upon making a sighting, drop a smoke signal or sea dye marker to mark the
   approximate location of the sighting. During search missions, have marking devices readily available
   to jettison. The crewmember who launches the smoke will announce "SMOKE AWAY" over the
   interphone.

NOTE:
During the presearch briefing, the aircraft commander should designate who will launch smokes to mark
a sighting. This will ensure a smoke is launched and preclude inadvertent multiple launches.
   17.7.3. Following the launching of a smoke signal and other marker, make a procedure turn to bring
   the aircraft back over the target, or if the observer can keep the target in sight, the pilot should imme-
   diately turn in the direction of the target. The observer will continue to call out the target position and
   distance to orient the pilot. As the turn progresses, the pilot or copilot should be able to acquire the
   target.
   17.7.4. The following procedures are for confirmed sightings:
       17.7.4.1. Keep the target in sight at all times. Mark with dye marker or smoke floats.
       17.7.4.2. Turn on IFF.
       17.7.4.3. Report the sighting to the rescue center, OSC, air or ground station, or operating agency,
       as appropriate. This report should include:
          17.7.4.3.1. Position.
          17.7.4.3.2. Number of survivors.
          17.7.4.3.3. Condition of survivors.
          17.7.4.3.4. Type of emergency equipment used or needed by survivors.
          17.7.4.3.5. Action already taken or assistance needed.
          17.7.4.3.6. Condition of weather and sea.
          17.7.4.3.7. Fuel remaining in hours.
       17.7.4.4. Orbit the scene. When two planes are available, one should climb to an altitude that
       ensures radar detection by other craft or land bases, and the other should remain low, keeping the
       target in sight. Both aircraft should remain on station until relieved by other aircraft, rescue or
282                                        AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


      recovery has been effected, or forced to return to base because of low fuel. In the latter event,
      mark the position with the best means available before departing the search area.
      17.7.4.5. Drop available emergency equipment and/or personnel, if required. If survivors are in
      life jackets, make attempts as soon as possible to furnish them with life rafts or other survival
      equipment and signaling devices. For rescue equipment drops (i.e., MA-1 kits, Parabundle, or
      Freefall drops), use the Search and Rescue Airdrop Equipment Deployment Checklist and the pro-
      cedures in paragraph 17.10. To airdrop PJs with equipment or RAMZ/ATV, use Search and Res-
      cue Airdrop Pararescue Deployment Checklist and follow procedures in paragraphs 16.9.8. and
      16.12.10.
      17.7.4.6. Direct potential rescue or recovery vessels and other aircraft to the scene by radio or
      visual signals. Radio and visual signals you may use to direct a vessel to the scene to include:
         17.7.4.6.1. Radio message to the vessel. (If unsure of frequency guarded by the vessel, use
         2182 KHz voice or 156.8 MHz VHF or FM.)
         17.7.4.6.2. ADF to take bearings on a vessel's LF or MF transmissions.
         17.7.4.6.3. VHF or UHF direction finder to take bearings of VHF or UHF transmissions.
         17.7.4.6.4. Radar and IFF.
         17.7.4.6.5. Signal light.
         17.7.4.6.6. Dropping message containers.
         17.7.4.6.7. Pyrotechnic flares.
         17.7.4.6.8. When radio communications are not possible, establish self-identification, then
         indicate location of the target by:
             17.7.4.6.8.1. Circling the vessel at least once at low altitude.
             17.7.4.6.8.2. Flying across the bow of the vessel at least once, and rocking wings at the
             same time.
             17.7.4.6.8.3. Sending a message by signal light or dropping a message, if possible.
             17.7.4.6.8.4. Heading in the direction of the target. Repeat this procedure until the vessel
             acknowledges by following the aircraft, or indicates that it is unable to comply by hoisting
             the International Flag, November (the International Flag, November, is a blue and white
             checkerboard). Crossing the wake of the vessel close astern at a low altitude means that
             the service of the vessel to which the signal is directed is no longer required.
      17.7.4.7. In daytime, use any of the following means to inform survivors they have been sighted:
         17.7.4.7.1. Fly low over survivors with landing lights on.
         17.7.4.7.2. Blink a signal light in the direction of survivors.
         17.7.4.7.3. Drop two smoke signals a few seconds apart.
      17.7.4.8. Aircrews sighting survivors at night should:
         17.7.4.8.1. Mark the position by dropping smoke floats or float lights.
         17.7.4.8.2. Request assistance from other search aircraft or ships.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                                283


               17.7.4.8.2.1. If a rescue vessel arrives in the area, direct it to the scene by giving the target
               position in relation to the float light. Drop parachute flares to assist the rescue or recovery
               vessel in sighting the target.
               17.7.4.8.2.2. If the objective has not been located, but its position is fairly well estab-
               lished, drop two float lights to outline the limits of the search area, the most probable posi-
               tion of target being halfway between the lights. Start the search from one light to the other,
               dropping parachute flares for illumination.
               17.7.4.8.2.3. If no surface vessel is available, but two aircraft are on-scene, have one air-
               craft fly over the area at 3,000 feet dropping flares at 2- or 3-mile intervals. Station the
               other aircraft 3 miles behind the illuminating aircraft, slightly upwind at 500 feet to search.

17.8. Scanning Techniques. Precise scanning is one of the most important aspects of a search. During a
search, all crewmembers will make a cursory examination of the area. For maximum effectiveness; how-
ever, assign personnel primary duties as scanners. If available, assign personnel other than the basic crew
to these duties. Thoroughly brief scanners on techniques prior to beginning a search.

17.9. Departing Search Area:
   17.9.1. Notify ATC and the appropriate SAR agency on-scene SAR aircraft, Rescue Coordination
   Center, etc.
   17.9.2. If other search aircraft have not arrived, reconfirm position, and advise survivors when further
   assistance will arrive, if known.

17.10. Pilot Directed Airdrops (PDA). Pilot directed airdrops of rescue equipment allow rapid deploy-
ment of MA-1 kits, pyrotechnics, emergency equipment, etc., in a rapidly changing environment. An
example would be dropping a MA-1 kit to a helicopter that ditched during helicopter air refueling. Spe-
cific patterns are MA-1 kit deployments and Parabundle and Freefall equipment drops.
   17.10.1. Use the Search and Rescue Airdrop Equipment Deployment Checklist to accomplish these
   drops.
       17.10.1.1. If the Search and Rescue Airdrop Checklist has already been accomplished and the air-
       craft configuration will not be changed for the delivery pattern (e.g., flap settings and/or doors),
       rescue equipment drops can commence immediately using the Equipment Deployment Checklist.
       The pilot will always brief the pattern and delivery to be flown.
           17.10.1.1.1. As a minimum, brief the type of equipment to be delivered, delivery method (pat-
           tern shape, relationship to wind, etc.), altitudes, airspeeds, commands to be used, and required
           actions for malfunctions.
           17.10.1.1.2. For multiple drops, the Post-Deployment Checklist is not required until after
           completion of the last drop. However, each pattern and delivery will be briefed. (EXCEP-
           TION: If the aircraft or door configuration will be changed between drops, accomplish appli-
           cable steps of the Post-Deployment Checklist and then reaccomplish the Search and Rescue
           Airdrop checklist.)
284                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         17.10.1.2. Once drops are completed, complete applicable steps of the Post-Deployment Check-
         list if required to change the aircraft or door configuration to perform continued search, or to ter-
         minate search and airdrop operations.
      17.10.2. MA-1 Sea Rescue Kit Patterns. The MA-1 kit is designed to meet conditions which
      require aerial delivery of emergency floatation and survival gear. The kit is dropped free-fall and
      abeam during a crosswind pass over the target. When correctly dropped, a straight line is formed on
      the water with an inflated raft at each end. After delivery, the two rafts with their high freeboard will
      begin to drift downwind until retarded by the partially submerged supply containers. Thus, when the
      kit is properly deployed, wind conditions will cause the kit to form a "U," partially encircling the tar-
      get.
         17.10.2.1. Surface wind will affect the kit and target in varying amounts in proportion to the area
         exposed above the water and displacement below the water. The kit will drift faster than nearly all
         seagoing vessels (outboards, cabin cruisers, trawlers, heavy displacement deep draft vessels and 1
         man liferafts) but slower than a 6-, 7-, or 20-man raft. If a kit drifts faster, it will be delivered
         upwind. If the target drifts faster, the kit will be delivered downwind. When the surface wind is
         less than 15 knots, the delivery pass will be offset approximately 50 feet. Distance will be
         increased 25 feet for each 10 knots in excess of the 15 knot base.
         17.10.2.2. When deploying an MA-1 kit in high winds the kit may be deployed with the rafts
         uninflated to improve drop accuracy. If this is necessary, the life raft inflation lanyard should be
         shortened and red streamers attached to facilitate inflation by the survivors. Detailed kit assembly,
         operation, and service instructions are contained in T.O. 14S-1-102.
         17.10.2.3. Pyrotechnics may be useful in determining wind strength and direction, and maintain-
         ing pattern orientation.
      17.10.3. Parabundle and Freefall Deployment:
         17.10.3.1. When practical, use a racetrack pattern for equipment drops. However, circumstances
         may dictate a modified pattern. Equipment may be dropped from the paratroop doors or the aft
         cargo door and ramp. The first bundle dropped is, in effect, a spotter bundle. Therefore, it should
         be the least critical to the survivors. Water deliveries must consider wind, drift, and sea state.
         WARNING: The delivery of equipment, no matter how vital, must never endanger the lives of
         the receivers.
         17.10.3.2. Equipment deliveries to land drop zones should be planned to impact within 50 yards
         of the target. Water deliveries should be planned to impact within 5 yards of the target or within a
         45 degree sector centered on the drift line for 100 yards. In any case, deliveries should never be in
         excess of 5 yards updrift of the target. The delivery of any equipment, no matter how vital, must
         never endanger the lives of the survivors.
         17.10.3.3. Pilot Procedures. Pilots are responsible for determining the mode of deployment,
         drop location, and type pattern to be flown. They must ensure the loadmaster is aware of the
         desired point of impact (PI). When the situation permits, the pilot will make an observation pass
         over the drop zone. Final freefall altitude will be no lower than 150 feet AGL. Final Parabundle
         altitude should be no lower than 300 feet AGL. Minimum altitude for all night airdrops is 500 feet
         AGL.
         WARNING: Keep turns below 300 feet AGL to a minimum.

         17.10.3.3.1. Aircraft altitude, attitude, course, and airspeed should be established by 30 sec-
         onds to target and no later than 5 seconds to target. The pilot will keep the crew appraised of
         their position in the pattern. As a minimum, on final the pilot will state "30 seconds to target,"
         then "5 seconds." Once the loadmaster spots the target, he will state "Target in sight" and pro-
         vide the pilot with course corrections if time permits. The loadmaster will use standard termi-
         nology as outlined in paragraph 16.9.6.5.
     17.10.3.4. Loadmaster Procedures. Loadmasters must understand the location of the desired PI.
     When looking for the target, the loadmaster will use either paratroop door. If the PI is difficult to
     spot, ask the pilot to give a countdown to the PI on the run in.
         17.10.3.4.1. The loadmaster will hook up the restraint system opposite the paratroop door
         being utilized. The restraint cable will be secured to the center anchor cable support with the
         shuttle forward of the center anchor cable support. The jump platform will be extended and
         the air deflector doors opened.
         17.10.3.4.2. Bundle dimensions for paratroop door drops, including the parachute, must not
         exceed 48 by 30 by 66 inches. Bundles in excess of 100 pounds require a second pusher and
         those between 350-500 pounds require two additional pushers. For equipment to be delivered
         from the paratroop door, attach the static line (if used) to tiedown ring 26-B or 26-F. Secure
         equipment until it is ready for delivery.
         17.10.3.4.3. If equipment cannot be delivered from the paratroop door, the loadmaster may
         prepare and position the equipment on the ramp for delivery, and use another thoroughly
         briefed crewmember to release the equipment. The equipment will be secured until ready for
         delivery. For equipment to be delivered from the ramp, attach the static line (if used) to a
         tiedown ring in row 30. The crewmember assisting the loadmaster will connect to the same
         restraint cable as the loadmaster with the shuttle aft of the center anchor cable support.
         WARNING: The shuttle will not be moved aft until after the ramp is lowered.
         WARNING: The shuttle must be moved forward of the center anchor cable support before
         raising the ramp to close.
         17.10.3.4.4. The loadmaster will normally spot the target 8 seconds prior to the release point,
         and give the preparatory command "Ready" and the deployment command of "Drop." After
         each delivery, the loadmaster will report status of drop (load clear or status) and impact point
         whenever possible.
     17.10.3.5. Trail Line Drops. Trail lines may be used to aid in the deployment of Parabundles and
     Freefalls. This procedure uses polyethylene rope 210' to 1,000' long attached to the bundle and
     stabilized with a funnel or sea anchor (size 1 recommended, pn F41608-88-D-0191) attached to
     the trail end of the line and dropped across the intended target. When deploying to ships, fly over
     the bow at 90 degrees to the ship's heading, draping the line across the ship's bow. The trail line
     will be S-folded in the same manner as for deployments in forested areas.
  17.10.4. Equipment Delivery in Forested Areas. Due to the possibility of equipment hang-up in
  trees, consideration should be given to attaching drop lines to equipment intended to be delivered by
  parachute. The drop line needs to be long enough to allow the chute to hang up in treetops, and still
  permit ground forces to recover the equipment. In addition to the drop lines now in use by units (local
  design and manufacture), consider the possibility of using equipment already maintained on the air-
286                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


      craft, such as MA-1 kit buoyant rope (210 feet long). Drop lines will be secured to the parachute riser
      snaps/connectors and equipment package "D/V rings" with carabiners or equivalent. The drop line
      will be assembled into accordion "S" folds, secured with retainer bands, and attached to the equipment
      package.

NOTE:
Final approach altitude should be adjusted to compensate for tree height, but never less than 150 feet
above the tree tops.
      17.10.5. Pattern for Night Aerial Delivery. NVGs may be used for night operations. Aircrews will
      accomplish either the NVG or Low Level checklist to configure the aircraft for NVG operations.
      17.10.6. Night Delivery. Equipment to be delivered at night will have marker lights attached. For
      water drops, attach the light by securing a double 5-foot length of type III nylon (550/cord) to the
      marker light, then attach the other end to the equipment. Stabilize the light to the equipment with type
      number 5 cord. Pass the parachute static line under the type number 5 cord to ensure light breakaway
      when deployed. For land drops, chemlites are recommended. Attach chemlites to prevent detach-
      ment.

Figure 17.10. Standard MA-1 Kit Pattern.




      17.10.6.1. Standard MA-1 Kit Pattern Procedures (Figure 17.10.):
         17.10.6.1.1. Maneuver the aircraft onto a flight path that is crosswind and approximately 50
         feet from the target on the side opposite to that of the intended kit delivery. Maintain drop alti-
         tude and airspeed.
         17.10.6.1.2. When abeam the target, begin the count (use seconds). Two seconds past the tar-
         get, release a smoke marker (if available). The pilot will count over interphone, "One thou-
         sand one, one thousand drop." On the command of "drop," the copilot or flight engineer will
         activate the appropriate flare launching switch on the copilot's flare launcher control panel or
         the loadmaster will manually launch a smoke marker.
         17.10.6.1.3. Maintain heading for 10 seconds and drop second timing signal (if available).
         Turn 45 degrees to the right and hold that heading for 15 seconds. Make a 180 degrees
         left-hand standard rate turn. Adjust turn to final so as to pass upwind or downwind of the tar-
         get (as required for the delivery). Distance will vary with the type of target and wind velocity.
         Rolling out, the pilot will notify the crew: "30 seconds to target."
288                                          AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


             17.10.6.1.4. Approximately 5 seconds from the smoke marker, the pilot will notify crew: "5
             seconds." Just prior to abeam the smoke marker, the pilot will command "Ready," and then
             abeam the marker, "Drop."

NOTE:
Aircraft without smoke markers should fly the pattern as described and attempt to drop the kit 4 seconds
prior to the target.
         17.10.6.2. Navigator Assistance for MA-1 Kits. The navigator can assist the pilot by the use of
         onboard systems. The navigator will advise the pilot when the aircraft approaches the final deliv-
         ery track.
             17.10.6.2.1. The navigator should set up the on-board nav systems as follows
             (SCNS-equipped aircraft):
                17.10.6.2.1.1. During the flight plan programming portion of the preflight, the navigator
                should load two dummy waypoints that will later serve as the IP and target. (The target
                will be the location of the survivor or position to which the kit will be delivered.)

NOTE:
This step will save time in-flight by eliminating the need to modify the flight plan sequence.
                17.10.6.2.1.2. As the aircraft flies over the target on the initial pass, the navigator will
                mark this position and store it. The wind (e.g., 180/015) should be noted and recorded at
                this time. The onboard system will allow the navigator to direct the pilot perpendicular to
                the wind on the final run-in to the target.
                17.10.6.2.1.3. Go to the plan page. Call up the dummy waypoint that was initially desig-
                nated the target and redesignate it as the mark point (stored target position). Don't forget
                to verify it.
                17.10.6.2.1.4. Now, go back to the preceding waypoint and redesignate it as the mark
                point.
                17.10.6.2.1.5. Define an initial point (IP) using a range and bearing from the original mark
                point and save it as the waypoint prior to the target. Use a bearing that is the reciprocal of
                the desired run-in heading (e.g. 090/270 degrees) and a range of 5 to 10 NM and verify.
                The pilot must confirm the final run-in heading before the navigator can load the bearing.

NOTE:
Keep in mind that the target will drift. This is basically a visual maneuver; the nav systems are used as a
backup. The pilot should make every attempt to keep the target in sight.
                17.10.6.2.1.6. The pilot will use the system to help maintain situational awareness and
                line up on the target for the delivery pass. During the run-in, the pilot will offset upwind
                or downwind as necessary (see paragraph 17.10.1.1.).

17.11. MA-1 Kits:
      17.11.1. The MA-1 kit consists of five bundles:
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            289


       17.11.1.1. The two end bundles (1 and 5) contain either a six or seven man raft. Bundles 2 and 4
       contain emergency radios and bundle 3 contains medical gear.
       17.11.1.2. The total weight of all five bundles is 232 lbs.
       17.11.1.3. Each bundle is connected by 210 feet of buoyant rope.
       17.11.1.4. The kit is deployed manually off the cargo ramp.
       17.11.1.5. Rigging Sequence.
   17.11.2. Intentionally Left Blank.
       17.11.2.1. Rigging sequence will be as shown in Figure 17.11.
       17.11.2.2. During in-flight rigging, the cargo ramp and door will remain closed. Attach a tiedown
       strap across the kit to prevent movement.
       17.11.2.3. Unsnap the inflation lanyard protection flap of container #1 (raft), marked 1 of 5 and
       leave open. Remove enough lanyard from the retaining loops to allow the snap fastener (yellow)
       to be fastened to ramp tie-down fitting 30F.
       17.11.2.4. Remove enough buoyant rope from container #1 to allow the rope fastener (red) to be
       connected to the D-ring (red) of container #2, marked 2 of 5.
       17.11.2.5. Remove enough buoyant rope from container #2 to allow the rope fastener (green) to
       be connected to the D-ring (green) of the container #3, marked 3 of 5.
       17.11.2.6. Remove enough buoyant rope from container #3 to allow the snap fastener (blue) to be
       connected to the D-ring (blue) of container #4, marked 4 of 5.
       17.11.2.7. Remove enough buoyant rope from container #4 to allow the rope snap fastener
       (white) to be connected to the lanyard loop of container #5, marked 5 of 5.
       17.11.2.8. Unsnap the inflation lanyard protector flap on container #5 and leave open. Remove
       enough lanyard from the retaining loops to allow the snap fastener (yellow) to be fastened to the
       ramp tie-down ring 30B.
   17.11.3. Rigging of Lights on MA-1 Kits for Night Airdrops:
       17.11.3.1. Lights are attached to containers 1, 3, and 5 (see Figure 17.12.). The loadmaster will
       inspect the lights for proper function prior to installation.

NOTE:
In high winds, the kit may be deployed with the rafts deflated to improve drop accuracy. If this procedure
is necessary, the life raft inflation lanyard should be shortened and red streamers attached with the words
"PULL TO INFLATE" on the streamers to facilitate inflation by the survivors. Detailed kit assembly,
operation, and service instructions are contained in T.O. 14S-1-102.
   17.11.4. Airdropping an MA-1 Kit in Support of SAR:
       17.11.4.1. Aircrews will use Search and Rescue Airdrop Equipment Deployment Checklist.
       17.11.4.2. The loadmaster will deploy the kit manually when the pilot states "Drop." NOTE:
       When delivering the MA-1 kit manually, the loadmaster will deliver all kits starting with the num-
290                                         AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


       ber 1 container. The desired interval is .7 seconds between the containers, and all five containers
       must be delivered within 3.3 seconds to prevent line breakage and/or damage to the kit.
       17.11.4.3. Any delay by the loadmaster after the pilot states "Drop" might cause the kit to land
       long.
       17.11.4.4. The loadmaster "Will Not Wait" to observe an actual green light illumination. This
       might cause the kit to land long.
       17.11.4.5. The loadmaster will use a restraint harness with the life line attached to a tiedown ring
       or anchor cable with an anchor cable stop positioned at FS 737, the restraint harness life line will
       be adjusted to prevent the loadmaster from exiting the aircraft.

NOTE:
The loadmaster will ensure all checklist items are completed, maintain control of bundles, monitor and
rerig any loose straps/static lines or equipment that may come undone due to wind blast.

WARNING: If search is conducted some distance from a known altimeter setting, take precautions to
ensure that the aircraft does not descend to a dangerously low altitude. Obtain forecast altimeter setting
upon departure or en route for the area of operation. Set the altimeter this setting and crosscheck against
the radar altimeter.
8. High Altitude Checks (as required) - "COMPLETE"                               (P)(CP)(N)(RO)(LM)(E)
WARNING: The "High Altitude Checks" will initially be called "Complete" during the Ten Minute
Checklist. The checks will be silently reaccomplished every 5,000 feet above a 10,000-foot cabin alti-
tude. When above 20,000-foot cabin altitude, accomplish this check every 15 minutes. Above 30,000
feet, every 5 minutes.
9. Aux pump - On (as required)                                                                        (CP)
10. Red Light - "ON" (Pararescue Deployment Only)                                                   (P/CP)
11. Flaps - "SET, STATE SETTING"                                                                    (P/CP)

  speed, fuel, etc. Refer to the Aircraft Performance Manual for specific search configuration flap set-
  tings.
  B. For rescue equipment or pararescue drops, set flaps to 50 percent at aircraft gross weights below
  140,000 lbs and 70 percent at or above 140,000 lbs.
12. Airspeed - "CHECKED"                                                                       (P)(CP)(E)
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                                295


  A. Refer to the Aircraft Performance Manual.
13. Air Deflector Doors (if required) - "OPEN"                                                         (P/CP)
WARNING: If an air deflector door fails to open, do not open the respective paratroop door and notify
the pilot.

NOTE:
Once air deflectors are called open by the pilot or copilot, this automatically clears the loadmaster to open
the paratroop door(s).
WARNING: Paratroop doors will be opened only by the loadmaster(s). After opening and locking, the
safety pin will be installed.
WARNING: Any time the paratroop doors are lowered, the jump platform will be retracted and the door
lowered completely.
14. Ramp and Door (if required) -
  A. "CLEAR TO OPEN"                                                                                     (LM)
  B. "OPENED AND LOCKED"                                                                                 (LM)
  C. "INDICATES OPEN"                                                                                      (E)

NOTE:
The flight engineer will open the ramp and door at 150 KIAS after receiving clearance to open from the
loadmaster and will report "Indicates Open" when the ramp and door light illuminate.
WARNING: If the cargo ramp and door fail to operate normally or the mission dictates, the loadmaster
may operate them from the aft control panel upon clearance from the pilot and once the lifeline is attached
and adjusted.
WARNING: Prior to opening the Ramp and Door/Paratroop door(s), all personnel aft of FS 677 will
wear a restraining harness with a safety line properly adjusted and attached to the aircraft or a parachute
with the static line connected to the anchor cable, or will be seated in a troop seat with the safety belt fas-
tened. EXCEPTIONS: Parachutists with reserve or HGRP (high glide ratio parachute) chutes on may
remain aft of FS 677 provided the aircraft does not descend below 1,000 ft AGL. Only crewmembers per-
forming duties will be permitted aft of FS 677. The loadmaster will ensure all personnel aft of FS 677 are
aware the door(s) is (are) going to be opened.
WARNING: During personnel airdrop, the aircraft will not be configured with the ramp and paratroop
door(s) open at the same time.

NOTE:
If the cargo ramp will be lowered to the ADS (horizontal) position during personnel drops, the aft cargo
door and ramp will be opened by the loadmaster as outlined in the pilot's crew briefing.

                                               (PJD/RAMZ)
This checklist will be used for pararescue deployment (PJD) utilizing the fixed, moving, and crosswind
target patterns. The pilot will initiate this checklist by calling for the "Pararescue Deployment Checklist."
1. High Altitude Checks (if required) - "COMPLETE"                                  (P)(CP)(N)(RO)(LM)(E)
WARNING: The "High Altitude Checks" will initially be called "Complete" during the Ten Minute
Checklist. The checks will be silently reaccomplished every 5,000 feet above a 10,000-foot cabin alti-
tude. When above 20,000-foot cabin altitude, accomplish this check every 15 minutes. Above 30,000
feet, every 5 minutes.
2. Turn on Final

NOTE:
No less than 2 minutes out from the release point, the loadmaster will allow the jumpmaster access to the
door to begin "spotting procedures." Use the standard terminology contained in paragraph 16.9.6.5.
When the jumpmaster if off the interphone, the loadmaster will relay to the pilot, all visual corrections
given by the jumpmaster. The jumpmaster may spot from the aircraft ramp or a paratroop door; however,
the aircraft ramp and paratroop doors will not be opened simultaneously.
3. "CREW, ONE MINUTE WARNING"                                                                        (P/CP)
WARNING: If any crewmember calls "NO DROP" after the "ONE MINUTE ADVISORY" call, no
deployment will be made and the deployment phase of the checklist will be reinitiated. Upon hearing a
"NO DROP" call, the pilot not flying will turn the red light on and, along with the loadmaster, acknowl-
edge the "NO DROP." For a RAMZ/ATV bundle "NO DROP," avoid adrupt maneuvers and make all
turns as level as possible as the equipment is restrained by the release gate only at this point.
4. "SAFETY CHECKS COMPLETE"                                                                        (LM/JM)

NOTE:
Pararescuemen will run their Safety Check, the loadmaster is responsible for accomplishing all other
appropriate checklists, overall safety in the cargo compartment. When either the loadmaster or jumpmas-
ter responds "SAFETY CHECK COMPLETE," this indicates that both the personnel/equipment and safe-
tyman checklists have been completed on all jumpers exiting on this pass.
5. "CLEAR TO JUMP"                                                                                        (P/CP)

NOTE:
When the pilot responds "CLEAR TO JUMP," this indicates that all conditions are favorable for personnel
deployment upon reaching the planned/desired exit point.
6. Green Light - "ON"                                                                                     (P/CP)

NOTE:
The pilot not flying will turn on the green light. Perform this step for live passes only. For streamer/spot-
ter or observations, leave the red light turned on.
7. Make Minor Heading Changes - Pass over Spotter Chute and the Target on a Direct Line, Establish
Drift Correction Prior to Passing over the Spotter Chute (fixed or moving target only)         (P)
8. Reverse Count Over Target (fixed or moving target only)                                                  (JM)
9. Release PJs or Equipment - At completion of reverse count (fixed/moving target) or when the Aircraft
is on a Direct Line with the Target and Spotter Chute/Streamers (crosswind target only)           (JM)
10. "LOAD CLEAR" (or state condition).                                                                      (LM)
11. "RED LIGHT" (N) - "ON"                                                                                (P/CP)

NOTE:
The navigator will call for the red light to be turned on upon hearing the "load clear" call or upon reaching
the end of the usable DZ length.
12. After Jumper(s) Clear the Aircraft - Turn to Observe the Accuracy of the Drop                             (P)

NOTES:
If personnel drops are complete or if the aircraft or door configuration will be changed, the pilot will call
for the Post-Deployment Checklist. If additional drops are planned, continue with the racetrack patterns
and Pararescue Checklist. Deploy additional jumpers using the drop heading and count established by the
jumpmaster. Disregard the spotter chute.
If the target drift changes (drogue chute is installed on target, significant wind shift occurs, etc.), the entire
spotter chute procedure must be reaccomplished and a new drop heading and count established starting
with item 1.

  A. The loadmaster will load the pyrotechnics needed for the mission prior to the aircraft being pressur-
  ized.

NOTE:
Prior to takeoff, the pilot will ensure the crew has thoroughly reviewed all emergency procedures. Brief
coordinated tasks for the airdrop prior to the first airdrop warning. Loadmasters and physiological crew-
members will brief verbal and visual signals that will be used throughout the mission.
  B. The loadmaster will confirm with the pilot, copilot, engineer, and scanners the pyrotechnic load by
  type and flare tube numbers.
  C. When required, the loadmaster will place the deactivation switch to the ACTIVATE position. The
  copilot/flight engineer and scanners will place their flare launcher control panel switches to the ARM
  position and check the SYSTEM ARMED light to ensure the system has been activated.
  D. The system is armed and operated by the copilot or the flight engineer as directed in the aircraft
  commander's briefing.
12. Restraint Harness/Parachute - On/Adjusted/Attached
WARNING: The loadmaster will visually check each person wearing a restraint harness or parachute to
ensure their chest strap, leg straps, and helmet chin straps are secured/closed and their safety line is
attached to the aircraft with the safety pin installed (harness only). Also ensure that helmet visor are down
or goggles donned prior to and during all in-flight operations with a door.
WARNING: When the static line retriever is rigged for tailgate operations, the left side personnel
restraint cable will not be used.
CAUTION: Loadmasters may wear a parachute during airdrop operations conducted at or above 800
feet AGL. However, since most rescue airdrops required a door to be opened at some lower altitude, a
restraint harness is usually more appropriate. Do not use the flight deck restraint harness for airdrops.
13. Restraint Shuttle (some airplanes) - Positioned
302                                          AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


WARNING: With only the cargo ramp and door open, all safety line shuttles will be forward of the cen-
ter anchor cable support and the restraint cable will be positioned as desired. With a paratroop door open
(with cargo door open, if desired), all safety line shuttles will be forward of the center anchor cable sup-
port and restraint cables position in the inboard slot with the quick release pin installed. If both paratroop
doors are opened, personnel aft of FS 617 must wear two safety lines, one connected to each side of the
aircraft.
WARNING: On other C-130s, for paratroop door(s) open, loadmaster or scanners/lookouts will attach
the restraint harness lifeline to tiedown ring number 26D allowing mobility only to the paratroop door.
For ramp and door operations, connect the hook to a floor tiedown ring at FS 677 and adjust the lifeline to
allow mbility to FS 835.
14. Appropriate Seats - Raised
WARNING: Ensure parachutists have secured all seats (as required) and no part protrudes/obstructs the
aisle or paratroop doors. Troop sets forward of the door in use will be raised and secured.

  C. Oxygen Regulators - ON/100 Percent
  D. Oxygen Console (as required) - Checked
  E. Buddy Checks - Complete

NOTE:
If an oxygen console is used, the loadmaster(s) will be stationed aft of it to perform in-flight duties. The
ASPO will be on interphone and normally forward of the oxygen console, if used, to perform in-flight
duties. This arrangement will provide a buddy system to check everyone on oxygen. Loadmasters and
physiological crewmembers will brief verbal and visual signals that will be used throughout the mission.
WARNING: The "High Altitude Checks" will initially be called "Complete" during the Ten Minute
Checklist. The checks will be silently reaccomplished every 5,000 feet above a 10,000-foot cabin alti-
tude. When above 20,000-foot altitude, reaccomplish this check every 15 minutes. Above 30,000 feet,
every 5 minutes.

NOTE:
Jumpers will use supplemental oxygen above 13,000 ft MSL. When supplemental oxygen is required for
jumpers, check the oxygen console connections, pressure and quantity. The loadmaster(s) will confirm
that cargo compartment crewmembers and jumpers have completed this action by receiving a thumbs up
indication from each person.
16. Red Lights - On/Checked (Pararescue Deployment Only)
WARNING: During personnel airdrop, the aircraft will not be configured with the ramp and paratroop
door(s) open at the same time.
17. Air Deflector Doors (if required) - "OPEN"                                                        (P/CP)

WARNING: If an air deflector door fails to open, do not open the respective paratroop door and notify
the pilot.

NOTE:
Once air deflectors are called open by the pilot or copilot, this automatically clears the loadmaster to open
the paratroop door(s).
WARNING: Paratroop doors will be opened only by the loadmaster(s). After opening and locking, the
safety pin will be installed.
WARNING: Any time the paratroop doors are lowered, the jump platform will be retracted and the door
lowered completely.
WARNING: Prior to opening the Ramp and Door/Paratroop door(s), all personnel aft of FS 677 will
wear a restraining harness with a safety line properly adjusted and attached to the aircraft or a parachute
with the static line connected to the anchor cable, or will be seated in a troop seat with the safety belt fas-
tened. EXCEPTIONS: Parachutists with reserve or HGRP (high glide ratio parachute) chutes on may
remain aft of FS 677 provided the aircraft does not descend below 1,000 ft AGL. Only crewmembers per-
forming duties will be permitted aft of FS 677. The loadmaster will ensure all personnel aft of FS 677 are
aware the door(s) is (are) going to be opened.
WARNING: During personnel airdrops, paratroop doors and the ramp and door will not be opened con-
currently.

NOTE:
During tailgate exits, all parachutists with the exception of the jumpmaster will remain forward of the
ramp hinge until the One-Minute Warning.
18. Ramp and Door (if required) -
  A. "CLEAR TO OPEN"                                                                                     (LM)

WARNING: If the cargo ramp and door fail to operate normally or the mission dictates, the loadmaster
may operate them from the aft control panel upon clearance from the pilot and once the lifeline is attached
and adjusted.
CAUTION: Ensure the cargo door is clear, the aft anchor cable supports are up, and the anchor tables are
stowed in the retaining clips prior to opening or closing the cargo door. Ensure any loose items are
secured. Sidewall containers/cargo door compartments without operable fasteners will be taped or
secured with Type III Nylon (550 cord). Ensure the urinal steps and modesty curtains are secured for tail-
gate drops.

NOTE:
The flight engineer will open the ramp and door at 150 KIAS after receiving clearance to open from the
loadmaster and will report "Indicates Open" when the ramp and door light illuminate.

ter anchor cable support for personnel/RAMZ/ATV/Container Ramp Load (CRL) tailgate drops.
20. Vertical and Forward Restraint Straps - Removed (for RAMZ/ATV/CRL drops)
WARNING: On RAMZ/ATV/CRL drops, parachutists (with the exception of the jumpmaster) will line
up along the load but will not move aft of FS 737 (ramp hinge) until the load starts to move aft.
CAUTION: The jumpmaster will be on the left side of the cargo ramp and may be spotting from the aft
end. Additional jumpers will be forward of the package and the loadmaster will be positioned to remove
aft restraint and to observe equipment and jumpers at all times.
21. Pre-Search/Deployment Checklist - "COMPLETE"                                                    (LM)(E)
WARNING: If the drop is aborted after completion of the Pre-Deployment Checks, the loadmaster will
ensure the aft anchor cable supports are raised prior to requesting the closure of the ramp and door.

NOTE:
The flight engineer will read this step as "Pre-Search Checklist" or "Pre-Deployment Checklist" as appro-
priate for the maneuver being flown.

NOTE:
If the Pre-Search/Deployment Checklist has already been accomplished and the aircraft configuration will
not be changed for the delivery pattern, e.g., flap settings and/or doors, rescue equipment drops can com-
mence immediately.
1. "30 SECONDS TO TARGET"                                                                                (P)

4. "LOAD CLEAR"                                                                                        (LM)

                            PARARESCUE DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
                                               (PJD/RAMZ)
This checklist will be used for pararescue deployment (PJD) utilizing the fixed, moving, and crosswind
target patterns. The pilot will initiate this checklist by calling for the "Pararescue Deployment Checklist."
1. High Altitude Checks (if required) - "COMPLETE"                                  (P)(CP)(N)(RO)(LM)(E)
WARNING: The "High Altitude Checks" will initially be called "Complete" during the Ten Minute
Checklist. The checks will be silently reaccomplished every 5,000 feet above a 10,000-foot cabin alti-
tude. When above 20,000-foot cabin altitude, accomplish this check every 15 minutes. Above 30,000
feet, every 5 minutes.

2. "CREW, ONE MINUTE WARNING"                                                                        (P/CP)
3. Load Release Gate - Checked (RAMZ/ATV Container Ramp Load [CRL] Only)
4. Aft Restraint - Removed (RAMZ/ATV/CRL Only)
WARNING: Upon hearing a "NO DROP" call, the pilot not flying will turn the red light on and, along
with the loadmaster, acknowledge the "NO DROP." If the RAMZ/ATV/CRL is held in place by only the
release gate strap, all personnel on the cargo ramp will move forward of the hinge, except the loadmaster
and jumpmaster who will monitor the RAMZ/ATV/CRL for possible shifting and secure as necessary.
5. "SAFETY CHECKS COMPLETE"                                                                        (LM/JM)
WARNING: Jumpmasters will run their Safety Checklist. The loadmaster is responsible for accomplish-
ing all other appropriate checklists and overall safety in the cargo compartment. When either the load-
master or jumpmaster responds "SAFETY CHECK COMPLETE," this indicates that both the personnel/
equipment and safetyman checklists have been completed on all jumpers exiting on this pass.
WARNING: Each jumper will be responsible for monitoring their own static line. (EXCEPTION: The
loadmaster will hold the jumpmaster's static line if the jumpmaster is exiting from a paratroop door on this
pass.) The loadmaster will monitor the jumpmaster's static line at all times unless preparing the RAMZ/
ATV/CRL or equipment for deployment. Jumpmasters will remove their reserve parachute and connect
their static line clip to their parachute harness (the static line will not be connected to the anchor cable)
prior to spotting from the aft edge of the ramp. An aircraft personnel restraint cable will be connected to
D-ring on the jumpmaster's parachute.
WARNING: During paratroop door static line drops, personnel will not position themselves directly
under the center anchor cable supports (A-frame, FS 737). Personnel in the cargo compartment during
tailgate drops will not position themselves below the static line retriever cable while the cargo ramp and
door are open.
6. "CLEAR TO JUMP"                                                                                   (P/CP)

NOTES:
After hearing "Clear to Jump", the loadmaster will alert the jumpmaster and relay all visual corrections
given by the jumpmaster to the pilot.
The pilot not flying will turn on the green light.
WARNING: When the pilot responds "CLEAR TO JUMP," this indicates that all conditions are favor-
able for personnel deployment. If any crewmember calls "NO DROP" after the "ONE MINUTE ADVI-
SORY" call, no deployment will be made and the deployment phase of the checklist will be reinitiated.
7. Green Light - "ON"                                                                                (P/CP)
8. Release Gate - Cut (for RAMZ/ATV/CRL only)

NOTE:
The jumpmaster will signal the loadmaster to cut the release gate strap. If jumpers are tailgating, this sig-
nals that they are clear to follow the load. When jumpers use freefall parachutes, they will not deploy
until after the loadmaster retrieves the RAMZ/ATC/CRL static lines/parachute D-bags. It may take up to
20 seconds for all equipment and personnel to exit the aircraft.

WARNING: Before cutting the gate, the loadmaster will ensure the jumpmaster has moved forward of
the RAMZ/ATV/CRL package. No person will be beside of aft of the package during gate cut and
deployment. If the RAMZ/ATV/CRL exists the aircraft, but fails to properly deploy (hangs up), the stat-
ics will be cut immediately.
CAUTION: The release gate must be cut below the knot to allow the nylon strap to pull free through
floor tiedown rings.
9. "LOAD CLEAR" (or state condition)                                                                   (LM)
10. "RED LIGHT" (N/P) - "ON"                                                                         (P/CP)

NOTE:
The navigator will call for the red light to be turned on upon hearing the "load clear" call or upon reaching
the end of the usable DZ length.
11. Jumpmaster/Safety - Notify (if required)

NOTE:
If personnel drops are complete or if the aircraft or door configuration will be changed, the pilot will call
for the Post-Deployment Checklist. If additional drops are planned, continue with the racetrack patterns
and Pararescue Checklist. Deploy additional jumpers using the drop heading and count established by the
jumpmaster. Disregard the spotter chute.

                           POST-SEARCH/DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
The pilot will initiate this checklist by calling for the "Post-Search checklist" or "Post-Deployment
Checklist" as appropriate for the maneuver being flown.

NOTES:
For multiple drops, the Post-Search/Deployment Checklist is not required until after completion of the
last drop, but each pattern and delivery will be briefed. As a minimum, brief the type of equipment to be
delivered, delivery method (shape, relationship to wind, etc.), altitudes, airspeeds, commands to be used,
and required actions for malfunctions. This checklist must be accomplished prior to initiating a different
type checklist.
Accomplish applicable steps of the Post-Search/Deployment Checklist and reaccomplish the Pre-Search/
Deployment Checklist, as required, when necessary to change the aircraft or door configuration.
1. Static Lines - Retrieved/Cut
WARNING: In unable to retrieve static line(s), cut on the command of the pilot.
CAUTION: Prior to retrieving static line(s), allow a few moments for the static lines to wrap around
together.
2. Jump Platform(s) (if required)- Folded in
3. Anchor Cable Supports (if required) - Up

                                                  Chapter 18

                      PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS/LEAFLET AIRDROP

18.1. General. Psychological leaflet airdrop is a method of communication. It provides a medium of get-
ting information to many people when other means of communication are not feasible. Leaflets may con-
tain written information, pictures, or a combination of both. Leaflets can be further categorized according
to specific uses, such as standard leaflets, special situation leaflets, safe conduct leaflets, or news leaflets.
They are persuasive, informative, or directive. Leaflet airdrops are accomplished in both hostile and per-
missive environments.

18.2. Mission Description. Psychological leaflet airdrop operations are airdrops of large quantities of
printed materials. Mission requirements vary widely depending on the volume of leaflets airdropped,
leaflet packaging, and the altitude of the airdrop. Aircraft allowable cabin load (ACL) governs maximum
quantity of leaflets airdropped. Loads will normally not exceed 25,000 pounds. The information in this
publication is based on high altitude airdrop of large quantities of leaflets. If specific mission require-
ments dictate deviation from information contained in this publication, modify procedures to meet spe-
cific requirements.

18.3. Packaging. The physical characteristics of the paper affect leaflet production. There is no standard
size, shape, weight, or format. The length of the message, graphics, artwork, local capabilities, and
resources available determine the physical characteristics of the leaflets.
      18.3.1. The aircrew must know the size and weight of leaflets to mission plan. This information,
      combined with the predetermined target coordinates, airspeed, and altitude are used to determine the
      release point.
      18.3.2. Packaged leaflets in cardboard boxes vary in weight depending on the mission, but normally
      will not exceed 150 pounds per box. Dimensions of the boxes will also vary. Ideally, boxes should
      not be smaller than 24 inches by 18 inches by 12 inches. Boxes of these dimensions are compatible
      with the intermediate conveyers.

18.4. Attached Static Line. Each box has a static line attached. The static line should not exceed 17 feet
in length. The static line is normally secured inside the box with cloth tape. The static line rips the box
open, releasing the individual leaflets after the box is ejected from the aircraft and after it reaches the end
of the static line. The same type of connector commonly used on personnel parachute static lines is nor-
mally used for leaflet box static lines. This type of attachment allows for ease and speed of connection to
the aircraft anchor cables. The other end of the static line has no hardware attached since it may cause
damage to the aircraft when it is in trail.

18.5. Crew Requirements. Typically there are seven crewmembers in the cargo compartment for a high
altitude leaflet airdrop. There are two loadmasters, two Aerospace Physiological Officers/Technicians
(ASPOs) and three additional crew members (any crew position). Duty positions are kicker, a hooker,
three feeders, and two ASPOs.
      18.5.1. Kicker Responsibilities. The kicker is normally the primary loadmaster on the crew. The
      kicker responsibilities include:
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             311


       18.5.1.1. General responsibility for crew duties in the cargo compartment and coordinates cargo
       compartment and flight deck actions.
       18.5.1.2. Assigns duties to the other cargo compartment crewmembers and briefs responsibilities.
       18.5.1.3. Is primary crewmember on interphone in the cargo compartment.
       18.5.1.4. Runs the airdrop checklist for the cargo compartment crew.
       18.5.1.5. Ensures adherence to all checklists.
       18.5.1.6. Is responsible for opening and closing the ramp and door.
       18.5.1.7. Installs and removes the bridge (if used).
       18.5.1.8. Releases boxes based on the interval of the airdrop.
       18.5.1.9. Advises the flight deck of unusual situations and initiates emergency/corrective action
       in the cargo compartment.
       18.5.1.10. Recovers and stows static lines during the airdrop, if time permits. (If time does not
       permit, all static lines are retrieved or cut after all boxes in that stick are released).
   18.5.2. Hooker Responsibilities. The hooker is normally the other loadmaster on the crew. The
   hooker duties include:
       18.5.2.1. Backs up the kicker and assumes the kicker position if the kicker becomes incapacitated.
       18.5.2.2. Hooks the static lines to the anchor cable and passes the box of leaflets to the kicker.
       18.5.2.3. Monitors the interphone and relays information to the rest of the cargo compartment
       crew if the kicker is unable to do so.
   18.5.3. Feeder Responsibilities. Select the three feeders from any available crew position. Their
   duties are:
       18.5.3.1. Provide an adequate supply of boxes to the hooker and feeder.
       18.5.3.2. Repair any damaged boxes.
       18.5.3.3. Maintain security of the load.
   18.5.4. ASPOs Responsibilities. The ASPOs are general safety monitors and oxygen monitors.
   Their duties are extremely critical to the safety of the crew. Most leaflet drops are high altitude and
   require the use of supplemental oxygen. Crew members are highly susceptible to physiological prob-
   lems because their duties require a high rate of physical activity. The amount of professional equip-
   ment worn (survival vest, LPUs, parachute, and weapon) and exposure to the extreme cold
   temperatures at high altitude further complicates these conditions. (The chill factor at the end of the
   ramp is sometimes -40 degrees F). ASPOs perform the following functions:
       18.5.4.1. Monitor the crew for symptoms of physiological problems or hypothermia.
       18.5.4.2. Monitor all crew duties and advise the kicker of unsafe conditions.
       18.5.4.3. Advise the aircraft commander of physiological problems or hypothermia and initiate
       first aid before landing.

18.6. Aircraft Preparation. Preflight the aircraft IAW the applicable flight manual.

18.7. Extra Equipment:
      18.7.1. Oxygen Hoses:
         18.7.1.1. Cargo compartment regulators are equipped with extended oxygen hoses. Obtain exten-
         sions that will enable personnel connected to the regulator to have unobstructed mobility to
         accomplish duties in the cargo compartment.
         18.7.1.2. Oxygen hoses on the oxygen console are normally 24 feet long to allow the ASPOs and
         feeders full mobility of the cargo compartment.
      18.7.2. Oxygen Console and Oxygen Cylinders. High altitude missions require a supplemental
      oxygen console and supplemental oxygen be installed on the aircraft.
         18.7.2.1. The aircraft oxygen system may not support the large crew required for a leaflet airdrop
         mission. There may not be enough regulators available. Even if there are enough regulators avail-
         able, the airdrop is very stressful for the cargo compartment crew causing them to use a larger than
         normal amount of oxygen.
         18.7.2.2. The high oxygen usage rate may over task the oxygen converter, causing it to freeze and
         preventing anyone from getting oxygen through the aircraft system.
         18.7.2.3. Stow the oxygen console and oxygen cylinders as required. Normally, rig them in the
         left or right wheel well. Attach the oxygen console to the upper seat support beam in the wheel
         well. Position the oxygen cylinders on top of the dual rail covers (MC-130), or any suitable loca-
         tion for other weapons systems and secure with aircraft tiedown equipment.
      18.7.3. Parachutes. The back style or chest style parachutes are the primary parachute for the cargo
      compartment crew.
         18.7.3.1. Cargo compartment crewmembers should fit and wear the parachute harness or restraint
         harness when over hostile territory or in any location where the aircraft is subject to hostile attack.
         Position parachutes so crewmembers have immediate access (within arms reach) to them.
         18.7.3.2. During high threat missions, the aircrew will wear their survival equipment (survival
         vest, LPUs, and parachute) as directed. NOTE: It is very difficult for the cargo compartment
         crew to perform their assigned duties wearing back style parachutes.

18.8. Aircraft Configuration. Determine if leaflets are floor loaded (on aircraft dual rail intermediate
conveyers) or are configured on pallets. Based on how the leaflets are prepared and the volume of leaflets
to airdrop, there are several possible configurations.
      18.8.1. Palletized Loads. Preload large volumes of leaflets on pallets and load as palletized cargo.
      Resources permitting, this is the recommended procedure for large volumes of leaflets.
         18.8.1.1. Use modified pallets with warehouse rollers attached to the top of the pallets in two
         sticks.
         18.8.1.2. Stack the leaflet boxes on the pallets in two sticks and secure them to the pallets before
         loading aircraft.
         18.8.1.3. In addition to the modified pallets, provide a bridge to span the gap between the last
         floor pallet and the ramp pallet.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             313


          18.8.1.3.1. Construct the bridge so the rollers on it are the same height as the rollers on top of
          the pallets when loaded on the aircraft dual rails (MC/C-130).
          18.8.1.3.2. Install the bridge after the ramp is lowered to the airdrop position and before com-
          pletion of the slowdown or 3-minute checklist.
   18.8.2. Floor Loads. Leaflets may also be loaded directly on the aircraft intermediate conveyors, if
   available. Employ this procedure for smaller loads of leaflets or when the equipment mentioned
   above is not available.
      18.8.2.1. Individual boxes have to be hand loaded and each group of boxes individually secured
      using aircraft tiedown equipment.
      18.8.2.2. Configure the aircraft IAW AFI 11-2HC-130V3, Addenda A.
          18.8.2.2.1. Recommend the intermediate conveyors be moved inboard to the high speed con-
          figuration if size of the load permits.
          18.8.2.2.2. If the intermediate conveyors must remain in the outboard configuration, exercise
          care during loading to ensure the individual boxes contact two intermediate rollers. The boxes
          may not roll or may be damaged if loaded on only one roller conveyor.
              18.8.2.2.2.1. If the intermediate conveyors must remain in the outboard configuration,
              consider using CDS skid boards or sheets of plywood as skids under the leaflet boxes.
              18.8.2.2.2.2. If using this option, secure each skid of leaflets individually using aircraft
              tiedown equipment.
              18.8.2.2.2.3. Drift each skid back to the ramp hinge during the airdrop, exercising caution
              not to let the skidboard exit the aircraft.
              18.8.2.2.2.4. Secure the empty skids against the side wall until the airdrop is completed.

18.9. Preparation for Loading. Complete applicable portions of the appropriate T.O. 1C-130A-9
checklists as follows:
   18.9.1. Cargo Loading Preparation.
   18.9.2. Cargo Loading (Palletized/Floor Load).
   18.9.3. General Airplane Preparation for Ramp and Door Airdrop/Extraction.
   18.9.4. Anchor Cables. Rig one anchor cable on each side of the aircraft.
      18.9.4.1. Attach the aft latch of each anchor cable to the inboard U-bolt on the aft anchor cable
      support on each side of the airplane.
      18.9.4.2. Position the anchor cable stops to the very forward or aft end of the cable or remove and
      stow the stops, unless they are used as stops for the restraint harness restraint strap.
      18.9.4.3. Attach the forward latch to the center U-bolts on the forward anchor cable support.
          18.9.4.3.1. If the center U-bolts are not accessible because of aircraft configuration, attach the
          forward latch to the outboard U-bolts.
314                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


             18.9.4.3.2. If connecting the forward latch to the outboard U-bolts, leave additional slack in
             the cable to allow anchor cable installation in the outboard location on the A-frame during the
             airdrop.
             18.9.4.3.3. Lower the center anchor cable supports and lock them in the vertical position with
             the tubular supports. Do not connect the anchor cable to the A-frame during rigging. The
             cable may block the cargo door from properly opening and closing.
             18.9.4.3.4. The aft anchor cable support arm micro switches should be isolated so that the
             cargo ramp will operate with the anchor cables lowered.
                 18.9.4.3.4.1. Isolate the micro switches by securing them back with 1/4-inch cotton web-
                 bing or gutted Type III nylon.
                 18.9.4.3.4.2. Test the ramp for operation with the micro switches secured and the anchor
                 cables lowered to ensure the ties were properly installed.
      18.9.5. Static line Retrievers. Suspend oxygen hoses from static line retriever cables for high alti-
      tude missions (not required if airdropping below 10,000 feet MSL).
         18.9.5.1. Unwind static line retriever cable(s).
         18.9.5.2. Install quick disconnects on the aft end of cable(s).
         18.9.5.3. Secure the quick disconnects to the inboard side of the A-frame with one turn of 1/
         4-inch cotton webbing. Make this tie approximately 18 inches above the anchor cable attaching
         point. If the static line retriever is inadvertently rewound, the tie will break and will prevent dam-
         age to the A-frame or static line retriever.
         18.9.5.4. Remove all slack from static line retriever cables.
      18.9.6. Oxygen Hoses and Interphone Cord. Tape or tie extended oxygen hoses and interphone
      cords together and suspend from static line retriever cables with G-14 clevis or suitable substitute.
         18.9.6.1. Ensure that approximately 12 G-14 clevises or suitable substitutes are available to tie
         oxygen hoses to the static line retriever cable(s).
         18.9.6.2. Recommend the kicker use the oxygen regulator and interphone cord aft of the left para-
         troop door. Route the cord and hose up and over the overhead structural beams, and back down
         next to the overhead ADS release. This technique keeps the hose and cord off the floor preventing
         them from becoming tangled or damaged. It also keeps it out of the kicker's way while kicking
         boxes and retrieving static lines.

18.10. After Loading. Complete the after loading checklist IAW T.O.1C-130A-9.

18.11. Securing Boxes. Secure five boxes on the ramp for airdrop. If loading preloaded pallets, two
sticks of five boxes each, are secured on the ramp pallet.

18.12. Connecting Static Lines. Connect static lines to the anchor cable aft of the A-frame.

18.13. Restraint Strapping. Place a single length of Type III nylon, as final restraint, over the stick of
boxes. The cargo restraint strap over the boxes on the ramp is removed at the 1-minute warning. The
Type III nylon final restraint is cut at the release point.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                               315


18.14. Mission Delay/Downloading. If there is a mission delay after the aircraft is loaded, consider
downloading the aircraft. The new ink in the freshly printed leaflets causes an odor when confined in a
hot aircraft. There is risk of the odor being very strong if the load remains on the aircraft over 24-hours in
temperatures above 100 degrees F.

Figure 18.1. Leaflet Box Rigging Procedures.




18.15. Leaflet Box Rigging Procedures. Rigging boxes for high-altitude static-line dissemination.
   18.15.1. Using a punch, cut four holes approximately 2 1/2 inches by 3/4 inches as indicated in Fig-
   ure 18.1. If a punch is not available, a knife can be used. When using a punch, the box must first be
   placed upon an object slightly deeper and smaller than the box so that a hard surface is provided when
   striking the punch.
   18.15.2. Cut through the box from one hole to another as illustrated in Figure 18.1.
   18.15.3. Place a 2-inch wide length of webbing through the holes. The length of webbing depends
   upon the size of the box, but must be long enough to tie after the box has been filled with leaflets.
   18.15.4. Place a 3- or 4-inch strip of masking tape over the 2-inch wide webbing.
   18.15.5. Cut all four corners of the box from the top to about three-fourths of the way down(or less).
   18.15.6. Again using masking tape, tape one strip up the cut portion and two across, as illustrated.

      18.15.7. After filling the box with leaflets, tie the two strips of webbing.
      18.15.8. Attach one end of the static line to the webbing ties. The length of the static line depends
      upon the type of aircraft, but it is normally about 15 feet long. The box is rolled out of the aircraft and
      as the container comes to the end of the static, line, the sides of the box split. In effect, it is turned
      inside out. The leaflets fall away followed by the empty box.
      18.15.9. This is one method, and may not be the method suited for your mission. Other variations do
      exist; however, this is the most universal and least complex.

18.16. Preparation for Airdrop. After takeoff, take the following actions before starting the personnel
airdrop checklist.
      18.16.1. Tape all ramp control panel switches, except the auxiliary pump and ramp switch.
      18.16.2. Lower anchor cables and connect them to the outboard side of the anchor cable supports.
      18.16.3. Safety tie the aft anchor cable support micro switches.
      18.16.4. Position/don emergency equipment and survival gear.
      18.16.5. Begin Personnel Airdrop checklist.

      HOT REFUELING AND COMBAT OFFLOAD PROCEDURES AND CHECKLISTS

Section 19A—Forward Area Refueling/Rearming Point (FARRP) Operations

19.1. General. Hot refueling is an aircraft to aircraft ground refueling operation with one or more
engines running. It is the actual transfer of fuel from the tanker aircraft through the single point refueling
(SPR) panel to a receiver aircraft. This operation is normally conducted at night in an austere environ-
ment. Forward Area Refueling/Rearming Point (FARRP) is the site at which the Refueling/Rearming is
taking place. Rearming may be conducted in conjunction with Hot Refueling. The FARRP also includes
all equipment and equipment setup/breakdown for each refueling point. A comprehensive mission brief-
ing and strict compliance with these procedures will ensure an expeditious safe Refueling/Rearming oper-
ation. The guidance in this section supplements the procedures outlined in TO 00-25-172, AFI 11-209,
and checklists. The Rescue HC/MC-130 is authorized by TO 00-25-172 to perform tanker and receiver
operations. Deviations from the procedures contained in this chapter must be approved by MAJCOM/
DOT. Prior to conducting hot refueling operations, ensure:

NOTE:
Currently, there is no FARRP requirement for Rescue HC/MC-130s. FARRP operations, i.e., implemen-
tation of Section 19A of this volume, require prior MAJCOM approval.
   19.1.1. The weapon system and support equipment involved are approved for hot refueling IAW TO
   00-25-172.
   19.1.2. The FARRP site is approved IAW AFI 11-235 and meets the requirements of TO 00-25-172.
   19.1.3. Fire protection equipment is available IAW AFI 11-235 and meets the requirements of TO
   00-25-172.
   19.1.4. All Air Force personnel involved are trained IAW appropriate command directives.
   19.1.5. Air Force personnel are qualified to use NVGs (for night hot refueling operations only).

19.2. Terms. The following terms are unique to FARRP operations:
   19.2.1. Wet Wing Refueling. Engines not running (power cart, GTC, or APU used). The same
   checklist and procedures apply as for hot refueling.
   19.2.2. Forward Area Manifold (FAM) Cart. A manifold that increases flow rates, stows refueling
   equipment and replaces the X or Y fitting when being used. The manifold also provides assistance for
   evacuating fuel from the hoses.
   19.2.3. Hose Deployment Personnel (HDP). USAF fuels personnel (AFSC 2FOXI) will be used to
   fill this function. HDPs are provided by the tanker aircraft and are responsible for deploying and
   retrieving the FAM cart, hoses, and other related equipment. The HDP connects the refueling nozzle
   to the receiver aircraft and refuels the aircraft if the receiver aircraft does not deplane a crewmember
   to perform those duties. If the receiver aircraft deplanes a crewmember to refuel the aircraft the HDP
   acts as the fire guard for the receiver aircraft.

      19.2.4. Hot Refueling Supervisor (HRS). The aircraft loadmaster will be used to fill this position.
      The HRS is provided by the tanker aircraft and is the overall supervisor for the FARRP operations.
      The HRS maintains primary interphone contact with the tanker aircraft and ensures all HDP, PO, and
      HRS duties are accomplished safely and IAW the checklist.
      19.2.5. Panel Operator (PO). The aircraft loadmaster will be used to fill this position. The panel
      operator is responsible for operating the SPR panel and the external drain pump when used (tanker air-
      craft only) during FARRP operations.
      19.2.6. Tanker Operations. The act of providing fuel/ammunition to a receiver source at a FARRP
      site.
      19.2.7. Receiver Operations. The act of receiving fuel/ammunition at a FARRP site.
      19.2.8. Fuel Servicing Safety Zone (FSSZ). The area within 50 feet of a pressurized fuel carrying
      component and 25 feet around fuel vent outlets of an aircraft.
      19.2.9. Rearming. The upload of munitions on the receiver aircraft.

19.3. Planning Factors:
      19.3.1. General. As a tanker, the C-130 can dispense fuel using aircraft to aircraft (SPR to SPR) hot
      refueling procedures from aircraft wing tanks or fuselage fuel tank system.
      19.3.2. Time Required. Using the minimum number of personnel, allow for 20 minutes set up and
      30 minutes tear down (tanker only).
      19.3.3. Limiting Factors. Planners must be aware of factors which limit FARRP employment and
      should consider the following when including a hot refueling option in an exercise or contingency:
         19.3.3.1. Location, quantity, and condition of hoses.
         19.3.3.2. Unit requirements for training.
         19.3.3.3. Availability of trained personnel.
         19.3.3.4. Aircraft availability.
         19.3.3.5. Proximity of FARRP to hostile forces and ability to move the FARRP if near direct or
         indirect fire.
         19.3.3.6. Total fuel offload required versus rate of flow. (When the "time to fuel" and "roll up"
         times are combined, the ground forces commander will know how long to secure the airfield
         before collapsing perimeter defenses.)

19.4. Responsibilities:
      19.4.1. Aircraft Commander. The AC is responsible for the overall safety of the crew and the air-
      craft FARRP operations. The AC relies on the HRS and PO to announce any unusual situations and
      to recommend the best course of action. The AC ensures the crew is briefed IAW this volume prior to
      commencing FARRP operations. The aircraft commander will:
         19.4.1.1. Ensure approval has been granted by the proper authority prior to conducting FARRP
         operations.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                        319


     19.4.1.2. Ensure all crewmembers are briefed on their specific responsibilities. Hand signals to
     be used between the tanker and the receiver should be coordinated, if possible, at this time.
     19.4.1.3. Analyze runway availability prior to landing to determine braking action. Unnecessary
     or heavy braking could delay FARRP operations.
     19.4.1.4. Analyze planned FARRP area for hazards and sufficient taxi clearances.
     19.4.1.5. Determine fuel requirements to include estimated onload, offload, and tank distribution.
  19.4.2. Loadmaster. Two LMs are required for all tanker operations. One LM is the HRS and the
  other is the PO. One LM is required for receiver operations, and will perform PO duties.
     19.4.2.1. The HRS is provided by the tanker aircraft and is responsible for all FARRP operations.
     The HRS will also be certified in the PO position. The HRS will:
        19.4.2.1.1. Brief HDPs and PO on their assigned duties and responsibilities.
        19.4.2.1.2. Ensure HDPs and PO have a thorough knowledge of equipment and systems they
        are operating.
        19.4.2.1.3. Ensure compliance with all safety procedures.
        19.4.2.1.4. Ensure compliance with the hot refueling checklist.
        19.4.2.1.5. Advise the AC of any unusual situations and recommend corrective action.
        19.4.2.1.6. Ensure all required equipment is on board prior to and after FARRP operations.
        19.4.2.1.7. Operate the ramp and door or paratroop door, if required.
        19.4.2.1.8. Complete the hot brake check prior to commencing hot refueling operations
        (tanker aircraft).
     19.4.2.2. The PO will be HRS certified for tanker operations. The PO will:
        19.4.2.2.1. Operate the ramp and door or right paratroop door, if required.
        19.4.2.2.2. Operate the SPR panel and external drain pump (when used).
        19.4.2.2.3. Maintain primary interphone contact during all receiver operations.
        19.4.2.2.4. Maintain backup interphone contact during tanker pre-hot refueling and hot refu-
        eling checklists.
        19.4.2.2.5. Maintain primary interphone contact during tanker post-hot refueling checklist.
        19.4.2.2.6. Complete the hot brake check during receiver operations.
  19.4.3. HDP (AFSC 2FOXI). The HDP are supplied by the tanker aircraft. HDP will be Air Force
  fuels personnel. A minimum of one HDP is required for each receiver point. The HDPs will:
     19.4.3.1. Configure and load FARRP equipment.
     19.4.3.2. Deploy FARRP equipment from the tanker aircraft.
     19.4.3.3. Perform fire guard duties during hot refueling.

NOTE:
HDPs may operate nozzles only on aircraft on which they have received previous hands-on training and
are knowledgeable of the fuel system operation and safety requirements.
         19.4.3.5. Drain and load FARRP equipment back on board the tanker aircraft during post-hot
         refueling checklist.
         19.4.3.6. Be capable of shutting down the tanker SPR panel in the event of an emergency.
         19.4.3.7. Perform other related tasks as directed by the HRS.

19.5. FARRP Equipment:
      19.5.1. Tanker aircraft will deploy with the FARRP equipment required for the mission. The support-
      ing resource manager (RM) function is responsible for supplying and inspecting this equipment and
      delivering it to the tanker aircraft. Mission requirements dictate the amount of FARRP equipment
      required.
      19.5.2. Use only approved FARRP equipment specified in TO 00-25-172 and in AFI 11-209 for hot
      refueling. Use only equipment that has been inspected by fuels personnel for FARRP operations.
      19.5.3. See Table 19.1. for a list of required equipment to establish a one-, two-, or three-point
      FARRP.
      19.5.4. Those personnel who will have direct contact with FARRP equipment during the hot refueling
      (i.e., PO, HRS, and HDP) will have the following:
         19.5.4.1. Spare flight gloves.
         19.5.4.2. Extra flight suit or change of clothing, including flight boots.
         19.5.4.3. NVGs with spare battery (as required). Carry the spare battery in a readily accessible
         location on your person.
         19.5.4.4. Dust goggles (as required).
         19.5.4.5. Survival vest (as required).
         19.5.4.6. Overt/IR chem lights (as required).
         19.5.4.7. Full canteen (in addition to water cans), to be carried on your person.
         19.5.4.8. IR compatible flashlight (as required).
         19.5.4.9. Sealable water and fuel resistant garment bag to store fuel soaked clothing.

19.6. Weather Requirements. FARRP operations will not be conducted if lightning is within 5 miles of
the FARRP site or high winds present a hazardous condition.

19.7. Safety. Because of the inherent dangers with the ground refueling and rearming of aircraft, safety
cannot be overemphasized. Marshalers, fuel specialist, and all other ground personnel must wear hearing
protection and be cautious to remain clear of moving rotor blades and turning propellers, when operations
are conducted with engines running. Marshalers must be particularly cautious when giving hand and arm
signals around moving helicopter blades since some light lift helicopters do not provide head and shoulder
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                              321


clearance under sections of the rotor disk. Above all, any movement of aircraft within the FARRP area
should only be at the direction of qualified marshalers and always under positive control.
   19.7.1. Equipment. Use only FARRP equipment hoses, nozzles, and couplers referenced in AFI
   11-209 and TO 00-25-172 during FARRP operations. This equipment is unique in that it provides for
   an internal bond that is not provided for with conventional refueling equipment.
   19.7.2. Fire Protection:
       19.7.2.1. Personnel involved in servicing operations will be trained in portable fire extinguishers
       and installed equipment fire suppression system operations.
       19.7.2.2. If FARRP operations are being conducted at an ACC or AMC certified site, a minimum
       of one 20-pound dry chemical will be located in the immediate vicinity of the tanker SPR panel, at
       each receiver point, and at the FAM cart, when used. Additionally, a crash fire rescue vehicle will
       be on standby just outside the FSSZ. If a fuel truck is used as the tanker, a large flightline Halon
       1211 fire extinguisher will be used in lieu of the 20-pound extinguisher.
       19.7.2.3. For exercises or contingencies where a crash fire vehicle cannot be provided, a mini-
       mum of one 20-pound dry chemical extinguisher will be positioned at the tanker SPR, at each
       receiver point, and at the FAM cart, when used.
       19.7.2.4. If FARRP training is being conducted on a military installation, a minimum of one
       20-pound dry chemical extinguisher will be located in the immediate vicinity of the tanker SPR, at
       each receiver point, and at the FAM cart (if used). Also, a crash fire vehicle will be on standby just
       outside the FSSZ.
   19.7.3. Electronic Emissions:
       19.7.3.1. Inertial navigational systems (INS or INU) may remain energized.
       19.7.3.2. Radar, radar altimeters, doppler or DVS, and ECM equipment will not be operated
       within the refueling area.
       19.7.3.3. Any hand-held radios used within the FSSZ must be intrinsically safe.
       19.7.3.4. HF radio transmissions are not allowed within the FSSZ during refueling operations.
       19.7.3.5. Voice communication contact between the HRS, PO, and cockpit will be maintained at
       all times during FARRP (tanker) operations. EXCEPTION: The HRS does not have to maintain
       interphone contact during the post-hot refueling checklist provided the PO has assumed primary
       interphone contact. Communications contact between the PO and the cockpit will be maintained
       at all times during the hot refueling (receiver) checklist. Hot refueling checklists are normally
       conducted silently. Voice communication should be used during initial upgrade training, in
       unusual situations, or during emergencies. All unnecessary voice communication is prohibited for
       safety reasons.
       19.7.3.6. Do not conduct hot refueling operations if wheel brakes indicate an overheated condi-
       tion.
   19.7.4. Aircraft Marshaling:
       19.7.4.1. When CCT/STS are responsible for primary air traffic control of an airfield, they will
       marshal and control all aircraft movement into the FARRP site. If CCT/STS are not available, all
       helicopter units are responsible for self marshaling into the FARRP site. All helicopters with the
322                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


         exception of H-6 derivatives will land just prior to the FARRP site and taxi to the designated refu-
         eling point. The helicopter will taxi into a position so its refueling receptacle is 25 feet from the
         IR chemlight placed on the water container. An operational refueling point is identified by an IR
         chemlight placed on the water container at the refueling point.
         19.7.4.2. If H-6 derivative helicopters are to be refueled or terrain features do not allow for land-
         ing just prior to the FARRP site, helicopters will hover taxi to the designated refueling point, using
         the procedures outlined in paragraph 19.7.4.1.
         19.7.4.3. If fixed wing aircraft are to be refueled and CCT/STS are not available, use paragraph
         19.7.4.1. procedures, except fixed wing aircraft will position the refueling receptacle 50 feet from
         the IR chemlight.
         19.7.4.4. Aircraft commanders must ensure these marshaling procedures are thoroughly preb-
         riefed between the tanker and receiver aircraft prior to FARRP operations. These procedures must
         be strictly adhered to at all times, to ensure all safety requirements are met.
      19.7.5. Emergency Procedures. Emergency procedures are published in the applicable checklist.
      They will be reviewed by all crewmembers and briefed by the AC prior to commencing FARRP oper-
      ations. All personnel, including ground controllers, will know the ground evacuation plans. Stop all
      FARRP operations immediately when a leak, unsafe condition, or system malfunction occurs. Correct
      the deficiency before resuming FARRP operations.

19.8. Briefings. Conduct mission briefings IAW AFI 11-209.

19.9. Checklists. The amplified and abbreviated checklists are generic in nature. The tanker and receiver
checklists are applicable to those aircraft equipped with and without the UARRSI modification. Items
(i.e. aircraft systems, checklist items, crew positions) in the checklist which are not applicable to a unit's
particular weapon system may be lined out in pencil. The hot refueling tanker/receiver checklist will nor-
mally be conducted silently. In this case the crew briefing in the pre-hot refueling tanker/receiver check-
list should be accomplished prior to landing. When the checklist is going to be conducted silently,
checklist responses will be terminated after the HRS or PO calls the hot brake check complete. The flight
engineer will read and call the post hot refueling tanker/receiver checklist complete. Those items pre-
ceded by a single asterisk (*) need only be accomplished when using the FAM cart (tanker only). The pre
hot refueling tanker/receiver and the post hot refueling checklists may be run in conjunction with the infil/
exfil checklist. The hot refueling abbreviated checklist is applicable to the cockpit crew and the cargo
compartment crew.

Section 19C—Combat Offload

19.12. Combat Offload Procedures. Combat offload provides a means of offloading single, multiple,
and married pallets, airdrop platforms, and CDS containers (loaded in the CVR) without the use of mate-
rial handling equipment. The wing, group, or theater commander may authorize combat offload when
hostile conditions or similar situations warrant the use of these procedures. The method of combat offload
will be determined by the crew based on the conditions at the offload site. Combat offload procedures can
be used by basic qualified crews.
      19.12.1. Cargo pallets, airdrop platforms, and CDS containers can be offloaded without damage to
      the aircraft with the cargo ramp in the horizontal position. Use the following methods for combat off-
      load operations:
         19.12.1.1. Method "A." Use this method to offload single, multiple, married, ramp, airdrop plat-
         forms, and CDS containers. Pallets, platforms, or CDS may be offloaded in a train-like fashion or
         one-by-one as the situation dictates.
         WARNING: Many explosive items have specific drop criteria that, if exceeded, render the item
         useless or dangerous to the user. With the exception of small arms ammunition (Hazard Class
         Division 1.4), explosives and munitions shall not be combat offloaded without approval of the
         MAJCOM/DO. These will be determined on a case-by-case basis. (EXCEPTION: Explosives
         and munitions rigged for airdrop may be combat offloaded without MAJCOM/DO approval.)
         Other items that may be damaged by combat offload will not be offloaded using these procedures.
         CAUTION: A taxiway of at least 1,000 feet is required, however, 1,500 feet is desired to provide
         a margin of safety. When pallets or platforms are offloaded one at a time, a longer taxiway will be
         required based on the number to be offloaded.
             19.12.1.1.1. Double or triple married pallets may be offloaded using this method provided the
             weight does not exceed 12,000 pounds.
             19.12.1.1.2. Airdrop rigged platforms up to 24 feet in length may be offloaded using this
             method provided their weight does not exceed 12,000 pounds.

NOTE:
Married pallets and airdrop rigged platforms over 12,000 pounds may be offloaded using these proce-
dures provided ballast equal to the difference between 12,000 and the weight of the pallets or platforms
remains in C through F compartments during the offload.
             19.12.1.1.3. CDS bundles rigged in the center vertical restraint (CVR) system may be combat
             offloaded using these procedures, offloading one side at a time.
         19.12.1.2. Method "B." Use this method to offload married pallets that do not fit the category
         for method "A" or for which no ballast is available for married pallets over 12,000 pounds. Four
         serviceable 55-gallon drums are used under each pallet to be offloaded. The correct number of
         drums needed to complete this type of offload must be available at the offload site or must accom-
         pany the load when conditions at the offload site are unknown.
         WARNING: Do not use method "B" for airdrop rigged platforms or to offload married pallets
         weighing more than 15,000 pounds.

  19.12.2. Aircrew Procedures:
     19.12.2.1. Prior to commencing combat offload operations, the pilot will brief each crewmember
     on the method and procedures to be used. The pilot will coordinate tasks.
     19.12.2.2. All crewmembers participating in the combat offload will refer to the checklist. Report
     any problem to the pilot immediately.
     19.12.2.3. Normally, individuals other than the aircrew are not permitted on board the aircraft
     during combat offload operations. If other individuals must be on board to assist the crew in an
     unusual circumstance, give them a thorough safety and procedures briefing for the entire offload
     sequence.
     19.12.2.4. A crewmember will take a position aft of FS 245 on interphone and PA and transmit
     warnings through all speakers of the PA system to help the loadmaster enforce all safety precau-
     tions.
     19.12.2.5. The aircraft loadmaster will maintain constant interphone contact with the pilot and is
     the only crewmember authorized to operate the dual rail locks during combat offload operations.
     WARNING: During the entire offload operation, no one is permitted behind or beside the load
     unless the loadmaster checks that all locks are locked and engaged in the pallet detents for all pal-
     lets, or secures each pallet to the aircraft side wall tiedown to ensure positive aft restraint. Always
     maintain forward restraint with the right hand latches.

19.13. Combat Offload Amplified Checklists:
      19.13.1. Preparation for Offload:

NOTE:
In a hostile environment, the crew briefing may be performed prior to landing.The pilot will initiate this

      19.13.2. Method A. This checklist will be used to offload single, multiple, or married pallets; airdrop
      rigged platforms; and CDS containers when MHE is not available. This method may be used to off-
      load pallets of POL or Class A explosives if the offload site is under attack or when authorized by the
      OPORD or OPLAN. The pilot will initiate this checklist by stating, "METHOD A OFFLOAD
      CHECKLIST."
CAUTION: To combat offload, a taxiway of at least 1000 feet is required; however, 1500 feet are desired
to provide a margin of safety. In excessively rough, sharply undulating, or battle damaged surfaces, dam-
age to the aircraft ramp may occur. Aircraft commanders will ensure the offload area will permit offload
without damage to the aircraft.

delegated and is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving
organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving
authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes authoritative
direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to accomplish missions
assigned to the command. Operational control should be exercised through the commanders of
subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is exercised through subordinate joint force
commanders and Service and/or functional component commanders. Operational control normally
provides full authority to organize commands and forces and to employ those forces as the commander in
operational control considers necessary to accomplish assigned missions. Operational control does not, in
and of itself, include authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal

designed to transport under specified conditions of operation, in addition to its unladen weight.
Permit to Proceed—Aircraft not cleared at the first US port of entry may move to another US airport on
a permit to proceed issued by customs officials at the first port of entry. The permit lists the requirements
to be met at the next point of landing, i.e., number of crew and passengers, cargo not yet cleared. Aircraft
commanders are responsible to deliver the permit to proceed to the customs inspector at the base where
final clearance is performed. (Heavy monetary fines can be imposed on the aircraft commander for not
complying with permit to proceed procedures.)
Point of Impact (PI)—The point on the drop zone where the first airdropped parachutist or cargo item
lands or is expected to land.

aircraft and prepared for flight. Passengers will be seated and loads tied down. Aircrews will have
completed briefing and aircraft preflight inspection prior to station time. Normally, station time will be 30
minutes prior to takeoff time.
Station Time (Airborne)—A specified time when parachutists will be seated in the aircraft with seat
belts fastened. This time normally will be 5 minutes prior to Air Force station time.
Suitable Airfield—Normally, suitable airfields are those which meet weather, fuel, and runway

               RESCUE HC/MC-130 AMPLIFIED CHECKLISTS AND PROCEDURES

A2.1. General. This attachment addresses a variety of threat weapon systems as they apply to C/HC-130
aircraft. C-130 aircraft are characterized by large radar cross sections (RCS), relatively slow operating
speeds, low operating altitudes, limited maneuverability, and limited defensive equipment suites, making
thorough pre-mission planning and avoidance of known threats paramount. C-130 aircraft will face dif-
ferent threat parameters and limitations than those already presented in AFTTP 3-1V2. NOTE: This
information is supplemental to AFTTP 3-1V2 and should be read in conjunction with that volume.

A2.2. Threat Intensity. The threat environment defines the enemy's ability to detect and lethally engage
the aircraft. In CSAR, operations are subject to cost and benefit considerations and threat analysis in the
same manner as any other military operations. Real time intelligence data is a critical element in deter-
mining enemy threat levels. The threat environment defines the enemy's ability to detect and lethally
engage rescue forces and must be carefully evaluated by the RCC/JSRC to determine the appropriate
mode of recovery to use. In general, two basic definitions are used to describe the enemy threat present in
contested environments:
      A2.2.1. Nominal Threat Risk. In the nominal threat environment, threats have either been
      destroyed, suppressed, negated, are widely scattered, or are non-existent. The rescue mission can be
      performed with minimal additional support from other assets.
      A2.2.2. Increased Threat Risk. In an increased threat environment, significant threats are active in
      the objective area. A successful CSAR mission requires extensive mission planning for threat avoid-
      ance or degradation of the threat by support assets. These support assets include, but are not limited
      to, RESCORT, SEAD, CAP, and other stike assets.
      A2.2.3. Employment Considerations. In low threat environments, resources may respond to rescue
      taskings with a minimum amount of mission planning. However, operations in increased threat envi-
      ronments normally require timely, accurate intelligence, and more extensive mission planning. The
      time required to conduct premission planning can be significantly reduced for CSAR alert crews when
      real time intelligence data is available and continuously updated through theater information systems.
      High density threat environments (i.e., integrated air defense systems) require significant degradation
      of the enemy threat and will require intensive planning and force packaging by CSAR forces to ensure
      successful combat rescue operations. CSARTF packages require closely coordinated planning to inte-
      grate their effort. The JFC can direct precautionary CSAR coverage (within a limited geographic
      area) in advance of a major operation. To facilitate recovery, combat aircrews should be knowledge-
      able of the rescue process, to include EPA preparation, identified selected areas for evasion (SAFE),
      and proper evasion tactics and techniques.

A2.3. Defensive Tactics. The Probability of kill (Pk) for any threat system will depend upon the tactics
employed, knowledge of the threat, terrain avoidance, aircraft performance, and expendables available.
Aircrew training will emphasize sound tactics, threat prioritization, and effective use of aircraft defensive
equipment to improve the probability of a successful mission. HC-130s operate in various profiles com-
bining the low (surface to 5,000 feet) and medium (5,000 to 25,000 feet) altitude regimes over land and
water. Consider the lethality of threats likely to be encountered in the planned propfile when setting
defensive priorities. Although the maneuvers discussed are based on a single threat, multiple threats will
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            357


likely be encountered. Give priority to the most immediately lethal threat. The aircraft's limited defenses
dictate that crew members and mission planners must understand their equipment and defensive options.
   A2.3.1. Lethality. Not dealing effectively with the most immediate threat significantly increases the
   possibiity of a premature end to the mission. For example, reacting to an airborne interceptor (AI) that
   does not know the aircraft is there while not avoiding the lethal radius of a ZSU-23-4 is faulty threat
   prioritization. If immediate threat reaction exposes the aircraft to subsequent threats, deal with them
   as priority dictates.
   A2.3.2. Mission Study. Ensure both comprehensive and detailed mission and feasibility studies are
   performed using the latest intelligence on threat capabilities and limitations. The importance of
   detailed study and threat knowledge cannot be overstressed. Be aware that adversaries may not fol-
   low the expected script. The variety of warning/defensive equipment installed on the HC-130 aircraft
   varies and will impact the nature of the defensive tactics used.

A2.4. Crew Coordination:
   A2.4.1. General. Crew coordination is essential to successful defensive tactics. It requires concise
   communication, positive action, and a thorough understanding of aircraft capabilities, limitations,
   maneuvers, and countermeasures.
   A2.4.2. Communications. Effective communication is vital. Information must be accurate, com-
   plete, understandable, and timely. Crews should utilize short phrase terminology and nonverbal com-
   munication, emphasizing AFTTP 3-1 terminology. Radio discipline is paramount to survival.
   Duration of transmissions should be 5 seconds or less.
   A2.4.3. Threat Calls. Successful evasion depends on timely receipt of an attack warning. Threat
   calls must be directive for imminent threats. It is critical that threat information be prompt, concise,
   and accurate. Before departure, all crew members/scanners must know and coordinate proper termi-
   nology to be used. Improper threat calls may initiate improper or late maneuvers. This may highlight
   the aircraft's position and unnecessarily encourage an attack. A properly formatted call ensures proper
   maneuvers are flown, the entire crew is aware of the most pressing threat, and proper coordination
   with the pilot is accomplished. There are two basic types of threat calls--possible and imminent.
   These calls can be made over intercom or interplane (if in formation).
       A2.4.3.1. Imminent Threat. The initial communication must be directive in nature, stated in the
       following generic format:
           A2.4.3.1.1. Maneuver (break, jink, hard turn, etc.).
           A2.4.3.1.2. Direction of maneuver (left/right, up/down, etc.).
           A2.4.3.1.3. Type of threat (SAM, AAA, bandit, etc.).
           A2.4.3.1.4. Call for expendables (flare/chaff).
           A2.4.3.1.5. Amplifying remarks (position of threat/MWS quadrant, trend information).
       A2.4.3.2. Possible Threat. The initial communication must be descriptive in nature.
           A2.4.3.2.1. Type of threat (SAM, AAA, RWR indication, BANDIT, etc.).
           A2.4.3.2.2. Amplifying remarks (position of threat, trend information).
358                                       AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004


      A2.4.3.3. Updating. It is imperative that the crewmember with visual contact advise the pilot of
      maneuvering effectiveness (e.g., "CONTINUE TURN, BOGEY RIGHT 3 O'CLOCK, GOING
      AWAY") and should also scan for additional threats. All other crew stations should stop talking
      and continue scanning their sector. If the pilot confirms contact, inter-phone calls should be lim-
      ited to terrain avoidance or other threat calls. Multiple threats must be clearly differentiated.
      Non-threats must not be introduced to critical communications.
      A2.4.3.4. Considerations:
         A2.4.3.4.1. At the first indication of a threat, the crew should call for help on CSAR Primary,
         RESCORT, AWACS, ABCCC, etc., frequencies.
         A2.4.3.4.2. Keep good situational awareness. Crewmembers must be cognizant of aircraft
         position at all times and anticipate the effect maneuvers will have on the aircraft or formation.
         A2.4.3.4.3. To avoid calling the wrong position, mark clock positions in the rear vision device
         (RVD), paratroop door windows, cockpit, or scanner's windows.
         A2.4.3.4.4. Contacts that leave your scanning sector should be passed off to other crewmem-
         bers. For example, the right paratroop door observer gives the copilot responsibility for a
         bogey moving up the right side as it reaches 3 o'clock. Crew members/scanners must
         acknowledge the "pass off" of threat responsibility and tracking.

A2.6. Orbit Timing Techniques. Aircrew members use various techniques for determining orbit and
exit times in order to meet a TOT or TOA. Three of these methods are presently in this chapter.

A2.7. Controlled Orbit Departure Timing. It may be necessary for an aircraft to hold at a point in
order to meet a controlled time at the combat entry point or corridor entry point. A satisfactory TOA
starts with the orbit exit time. Figure A2.1. provides one method of determining the proper orbit to meet
an exit time. The following values were used in the example.
   A2.7.1. Computing a Time Adjustment Factor:
       A2.7.1.1. Figure the altitude W/V relative to the aircraft track.
       A2.7.1.2. Enter the top of the graph with relative wind direction and velocity.
       A2.7.1.3. Proceed vertically downward to total-time-in-orbit line.
       A2.7.1.4. Proceed horizontally to the right and read the correction factor.
   A2.7.2. Using the Graph:
       A2.7.2.1. Divide planned orbit time in half.
       A2.7.2.2. Apply the correction factor to the resulting value.
       A2.7.2.3. When over the orbit point outbound, start stopwatch timing for the amount of time com-
       puted. When time has elapsed, start turn inbound. Aircraft should cross the orbit point again at
       the planned exit time.

NOTES:

           1. Graph assumes that the turn inbound equals the turn outbound, so no additional correc-
              tions are necessary. Chart is based on a 20-degree bank angle.
           2. Distance used in this computation includes full drift correction applied on both the out-
              bound and inbound legs. If drift correction is not applied, additional distance traveled will
              increase the time adjustment factor by an amount proportional to the wind velocity.
                 Outbound Course ...........180 degrees True
                 W/V................................220/15 True
                 Total Time in Orbit ........15 minutes

can figure both rate and radius of a turn. This is useful when planning orbits using bank angles other than
20 degrees or when planning non-standard patterns (such as timing triangles). Rate and radius can be
determined using Figure A2.2. Radius can then be converted to time.
   A2.8.1. Determining Rate of Turn:
       A2.8.1.1. Enter the graph at the bottom with true airspeed. Proceed vertically upward to the diag-
       onal line corresponding with "Bank Angle for Rate of Turn."
       A2.8.1.2. Proceed horizontally to the right. Read degrees per second on the outside scale.
   A2.8.2. Determining Radius of Turn:
       A2.8.2.1. Enter the graph at the bottom with true airspeed. Proceed vertically upward to the diag-
       onal line corresponding with "Bank Angle for Radius of Turn."
       A2.8.2.2. Proceed horizontally to the right. Read radius of turn in feet on the inside scale.
   A2.8.3. Determining Time Elapsed in the Turn:
       A2.8.3.1. Convert radius to distance traveled.
           A2.8.3.1.1. Determine 360-degree turn circumference in nautical miles using the formula
           C=(6283 * r)/6076 (where C = circumference in nautical miles and r = radius in feet).
           A2.8.3.1.2. Determine distance traveled by the aircraft using the formula D=(T/360 * C
           (where D = distrance traveled; T = number of degrees difference between new heading and old
           heading; C = circumferene in nautical miles).
       A2.8.3.2. Convert distance traveled to time elapsed using the formula t = D/TAS (where t = time
       elapsed; D = distance traveled; TAS equals aircraft true airspeed).

A2.9. TOT Control for 10-Minute Multiple Passes. If necessary to meet a TOT on a race track or mul-
tiple passes, Figure A2.2. can be used to determine correct timing for multiples of 10 minutes.
      A2.9.1. When established outbound and abeam the release point, start stopwatch timing and note
      time remaining to next drop.
      A2.9.2. Enter the chart with total time remaining (on the left) and outbound ground speed (on the
      top). The table value equates to stopwatch time-to-turn. For ground speed values not depicted, inter-
      polate, or compute a time using the formula:
         TR minus 110 = TT.
         OTAS = ITASIGS.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                             377


       (where TR = time remaining in seconds; TT = time to turn in seconds; OTAS = outbound true
       air-speed).
       ITAS = inbound true airspeed; IGS = inbound ground speed).
   A2.9.3. Exercise extreme care when applying drift correction on the outbound leg, as the chart is
   based on a symmetrical racetrack and 20 degrees of bank in the turms.
   A2.9.4. Power must be decreased as soon as WINGS LEVEL INBOUND.

A2.10. Combat Mission Considerations. The information in this section is intended to aid aircrew
members in planning for situations that may be encountered during actual combat or combat aircrew
training missions. This information provides a starting point from which aircrew members may develop
techniques to enhance crew task management and reduce probability of kill.

A2.11. Aircraft Configuration. When evasive maneuvers are anticipated during any phase of a combat
mission, security of the aircraft and items contained herein should be assured prior to takeoff. The follow-
ing paragraphs list steps that crewmembers should take to ensure that damage to aircraft equipment or
injury to passengers or crewmembers is kept to a minimum.
   A2.11.1. All Crew Positions:
       A2.11.1.1. Flight bags - tied down in cargo compartment.
       A2.11.1.2. Quick don or smoke mask - secured. A piece of 5-cord tied through the clip ensures
       that the mask will not come loose during maneuvers while still allowing "breakaway" access.
       A2.11.1.3. Survival and flak vests - worn (on and zipped).
       A2.11.1.4. Safety belt and shoulder harness (except loadmasters) - fastened and locked.
       A2.11.1.5. Helmet - worn (mask secured).

NOTE:
If boom mike is mounted on the helmet, the mask should be in the helmet bag.
       A2.11.1.6. Helmet bag - zipped closed and secured to the back of the seat (or cup holder for
       pilots) by the snaffle hook.
   A2.11.2. Pilot and Copilot:
       A2.11.2.1. Checklist - secured to side panel or cup holder with snaffle hook or checklist ring, or
       strapped to upper thigh.
       A2.11.2.2. FLIP - approach plates secured in holders with rubber bands or duct tape; other pubs
       in drawer at navigator station (secured with tape) or in pubs rack behind pilot and copilot seat with
       tape or string over the top (just enough to prevent the pubs from leaving the holder during negative
       Gs, but not enough to prevent ready access if needed).
       A2.11.2.3. Charts - secured in approach plate holder, kneeboard, or kept in leg pocket of flight
       suit until needed.
   A2.11.3. Navigator (Visual):

         A2.11.3.1. Restraint harness - fitted and worn. Can be secured to a ring set in the rail behind the
         pilot and copilot seat in order to prevent the navigator from hitting the ceiling during negative Gs.
         A2.11.3.2. Loose items (stopwatch, whiz wheel, etc.) - tied to the sunshade mounting tube with
         5/ 50 cord.
         A2.11.3.3. Kneeling cushion (if available) - secured to floor with Velcro, duct tape, or 5/50 cord.

NOTE:
Wearing kneepads under the flight suit also works well.
         A2.11.3.4. Ridge crossing strap - in place. This is a 5,000 lb. tie-down strap run from the upper
         bunk to a ring set in the rail behind the pilot and copilot seat to give the navigator something to
         hang on to during pushovers.
         WARNING: Presence of this strap without a predetermined egress plan may impede crewmem-
         bers as they attempt to exit the aircraft during an emergency.
      A2.11.4. Flight Engineer:
         A2.11.4.1. Checklist - secured to back of pilot and copilot seat with snaffle hook or checklist
         ring, or strapped to upper thigh.
         A2.11.4.2. AFTO Form 781 - stowed underneath the lower bunk.
         A2.11.4.3. TOLD cards - secured to publications bin or glare shield with Velcro or spring clips.

         the edge of the galley face.
         A2.11.5.3. Litter strap containers - secured.

NOTE:
If the canvas covers are missing, use duct tape and wrap it completely around the bin. The tape tends not
to stick to the paint on the bin otherwise.
         A2.11.5.4. Winch power cord - remove and secure. May be tied to floor or stowed in the pubs
         cabinet.
         A2.11.5.5. Engine intake covers - tied to floor.
         A2.11.5.6. Ground wires - stowed in publications cabinet.
         A2.11.5.7. Litter stanchions - locked and secured. Consider running a strap completely around
         all the stanchions to hold them together, as they sometimes come loose during negative Gs.
         A2.11.5.8. Seat support beams - secure. If the clips are loose, consider using 5/50 cord for addi-
         tional restraint.
         A2.11.5.9. Storage boxes - secure. Use safety wire or duct tape to secure the latch, or tie a piece
         of 5/50 cord around the box to keep the lid on during combat maneuvering.

       A2.11.5.10. Ground loading ramps - secure. Consider using a tie-down strap for additional
       restraint.
       A2.11.5.11. Truck loading ramps - secure. Consider using a tie-down strap for additional
       restraint.
       A2.11.5.12. Jump platforms - apply additional restraint.
       A2.11.5.13. Anchor cable support braces - apply additional restraint.
       A2.11.5.14. Emergency equipment (EEBD, POK, etc.) - tied or clipped to a seat rod or other
       convenient point.
       A2.11.5.15. Windows - use a grease pencil to mark the clock positions and left or right on the
       paratroop door windows to aid in lookout responsibilities.
       A2.11.5.16. Personal restraint system - installed. This could be anything as simple as a stan-
       dard restraint harness or as complex as any of the makeshift "seats" rigged in the paratroop doors.

A2.12. Terrain Masking. When available, terrain can be a rescue aircrew's best friend. Terrain can
block acquisition when used directly and can confuse radar and infrared (IR) threat systems when used
indirectly. The following pargraphs give some considerations for using terrain indirectly.
   A2.12.1. "Military Crest." Flying the "military crest" (approximately two-thirds of the way up a
   ridgeline or hill) provides indirect terrain masking when no known ground threats are present. The
   "military crest" gives maneuvering airspace beneath the aircraft and allows the aircraft the ability to
   cross the ridge if engaged by an air threat.
   A2.12.2. If a ground threat is known to exist, the "military crest" may skylight the aircraft. In this
   case, flying one third of the way up a ridgeline or hill provides clearance from the valley floor while
   keeping the aircraft masked.
   A2.12.3. Most long range acquisition radars achieve their range by entending the wavelength of the
   radar. Since the radar wavelength is directly proportional to the minimum distance required between
   targets in order to differentiate them from each other, an aircraft flying close enough to a ridge or hill
   may, in fact, not be distinguishable from background clutter. Consult AFTTP 3-1, applicable vol-
   umes, and unit intelligence personnel for radar-specific information.
   A2.12.4. Flying in Terrain with Winds Greater Than 10 Knots:
       A2.12.4.1. When flying in a valley, attempt to fly on the downward side to avoid mountain wave
       turbulence.
       A2.12.4.2. Crossing a Ridge Line:
          A2.12.4.2.1. Crossing with a head wind causes the aircraft to enter mountain wave turbulence
          at the point where a severe downdraft may prevent successsful climb to crossing altitude.
          Crossing with a head wind reduces the balloning effect as the aircraft crests the ridge and
          descends.
          A2.12.4.2.2. Crossing with a tail wind allows a smooth transition from approach to the point
          of cresting. Pilots must be aware of the ballooning effect as they crest the ridge and be ready
          to counter with bank angle and rudder. High tail winds produce mountain wave turbulence
          behind the ridge that may result in severe down drafts as the aircraft begins the descent.

A2.13. Energy Maneuverability:
      A2.13.1. Introduction. Information on HC-130 capabilities has historically addressed only tradi-
      tional roles and missions. Life capacity, endurance, and range were the primary concerns. However,
      today's combat arena demands maximum maneuvering flight performance from the aircraft and
      crews. One way to better employ the HC-130 in the ACM environment is through an understanding
      of performance charts and energy maneuverability (EM) concepts. An in-depth knowledge of an air-
      craft's capabilities not only increases tactical effectiveness but also enhances safety and survivability.
         A2.13.1.1. Effects of Power. The C-130 is unique in that approximately 46 percent of the wing
         area is immersed in the propeller's slipstream. This high velocity airflow produces exceptional
         wing lift at high power settings and can substantially decrease stall speeds, as compared to
         power-off conditions. Caution must be used in reducing power during aggressive maneuvering as
         the resulting loss of lift may cause a stall without a change in angle of attack. Conversely, if a stall
         is inadvertently approached, a rapid increase in power may solve the problem.
         A2.13.1.2. Corner Velocity. Although not addressed in the enclosed figures, a 90,000 pound
         HC-130 has a corner velocity of approximately 170 KIAS; a 140,000 pound HC-130 has a corner
         velocity of approximately 205 KIAS. As previously mentioned, there are several reasons to fly at
         other speeds, but keep in mind the corner velocity if the aircraft maneuvers against a threat. It can-
         not be overemphasized that a keen knowledge of performance capabilities is vitally important
         when planning and flying missions in a combat environment.
         A2.13.1.3. Maximum Performance. In order to achieve maximum performance from the
         HC-130, the aircrew must understand the aircraft's performance capabilities and be trained in
         maximum performance aircraft handling. Training and proficiency will allow the pilot to recog-
         nize the approach of performance limits. Maximum turn performance is not something done for
         entertainment in the traffic pattern; it is a deadly serious area of the flight envelope used when nec-
         essary. Failure to give adequate respect to the aircraft's performance and structural limitations can
         easily result in mission failure. Maximum performance capabilities are most effective when com-
         bined with SA, timely implementation of planned maneuvers, and positive aircraft control.
         A2.13.1.4. Above Corner Velocity. Flying at speeds well above corner velocity makes the air-
         craft feel like it is handling better; even at high G loading. The wing is well within the normal
         operating angle of attack. An additional 40 knots will give the pilot a warm fuzzy feeling in terms
         of aircraft response and stall margin, but at the expense of a 20 percent loss in turn rate and more
         than 40 percent increase in turn radius. That much additional performance could be the difference
         netween successful defense and deadly mission termination. When performing aggressive break
         maneuvers at higher airspeeds, caution must be used as the available G may exceed aircraft design
         limits.
         A2.13.1.5. Other Considerations. Selection of the appropriate airspeed for the specific situation
         is only one of the many important factors in the overall tactical picture. Pilot awareness of current
         energy level, energy available, stall speed, turn performance, and aircraft limitations is extremely
         critical to operations in low level, mountainous terrain, or high-threat environments. Other con-
         siderations include effective terrain masking to avoid detection and effective lookout to detect an
         attack may have more effect on mission success and survival than the selection of an en route air-
         speed.

A2.14. Main Points:
   A2.14.1. Structural design loads for the C/HC-130 are the result of design criteria loading conditions
   which are evaluated over the range of design loading parameters.
   A2.14.2. The design conditions include abrupt and steady symmetrical maneuvers, accelerated and
   steady rolls, abrupt yawing maneuvers, sudden engine failure, vertical and lateral gust inputs, high
   sink rate landings, and ground operations.
   A2.14.3. The design loading paramaeters include zero fuel weight, fuel weight and distribution, cen-
   ter-of-gravity position, airspeed, airplane configuration (clean, flap down, airdrop system), distribu-
   tion of cargo, and other variables within design limits of the airplane.
   A2.14.4. It should be noted that the aircraft is designed for the most critical of possible leading
   parameters, not for those that are probable; thus, there is a degree of conservatism in the design loads
   relative to probable normal operations.
   A2.14.5. There is enough elevator control power available to cause severe structural damage if the
   aircrew fails to observe the appropriate maneuver load factor limitations.
   A2.14.6. Abrupt elevator inputs may result in load factors overshooting and exceeding design load
   limits on the horizontal tail and fuselage after body.
   A2.14.7. Do not exceed a bank angle of 60 degrees with flaps up, roll at 3 Gs, or abruptly reverse the
   ailerons past nuetral to check roll maneuvers.
   A2.14.8. Rudder deflections are best applied slowly. However, abrupt rudder inputs are permissible
   with flaps retracted if corrective rudder is not applied until after equilibrium (steady state) sideslip is
   reached. Corrective rudder deflection should not go beyond neutral.
   A2.14.9. The airframe becomes less tolerant of exceeding structural operating limitations depending
   on its operational history, accrued flight time, inspection, and maintenance history, etc.

                                  RADAR DETECTION FORMULAS

A2.15. Radar Coverage. The radar coverage of a region is rapidly determined using computer mission
planning systems. The following formulas are useful to manually calculate radar coverage and detection
capability when computer mission planning systems are not available. The formulas may also be used to
double check the validity of the computer products.

A2.16. Maximum Theoretical Range. Based on pulse repetition frequency (PRF), this is the maximum
range from which a radar echo can return before the next pulse is transmitted.
  PRF = Pulse Repetition Frequency
  MTR = Maximum Theoretical Range (NM)
  MTR = 80,000/radar PRF

A2.17. Radar Horizon Distance (RHD). Used to determine the low altitude coverage of a radar over
the water or flat terrain. The coverage is based on the line of sight limitation of the radar. Flying at a dis-
tance greater than the RHD will prevent aircraft detection by radar (under normal atmospheric condi-
tions).
  RHD = 1.06 ( ÷A + ÷H)
  RHD = Radar Horizon Distance (NM)
  A = Aircraft altitude (FT AGL)
  H = Antenna height (FT AGL)

NOTES:
Instead of 1.06, multiply by 1.23 for RHD in statute miles (SM).
Atmospheric ducting can greatly increase or decrease the RHD at some altitudes. Always check with
weather for the presence and potential of ducting in the area of operations. Passive detection of aircraft
emissions may occur far beyond the RHD regardless of ducting.

A2.18. Radar Resolution. Resolution is a measure of the radar's ability to separate targets that are close
together in range, azimuth, or elevation into individual returns. Range resolution is determined primarily
by pulse width (PW), and deals with targets at the same bearing that are close together in range. Range
resolution can be calculated by using the formula:
  Range Resolution (feet) = PW x 984'/2

A2.19. Azimuth and Elevation Resolution. These are determined by beam width. Generally, the wider
the beam width or the farther the target from the antenna, the poorer the resolution capability. Azimuth
and elevation can be calculated using the following formula:
  Resolution (feet) = [17.8 x beam width(degrees)] x [6 x distance (NM)].
  This equation converts feet to mils or NM. The number 17.8 converts to mils, whereas the number 6
  converts to 1 nautical mile.

NOTE:
If an aircraft is flying within one-half beam width of the ground, it is safe to assume that target is suscep-
tible to radar detection by pulsed radars with Moving Target Indicator (MTI) and by Doppler-capable
radars. If the radar is not Doppler-capable and has no MTI, then a target is probably not susceptible to
detection.

A2.20. Detection Free Altitude. Used to determine the highest altitude an aircraft can transit a point and
remain below the radar's coverage. Based on the line of sight limitations when an obstacle and terrain lies
between the radar and the aircraft. A graphic depiction of DFA is shown in Figure A2.4.
  DFA = FG = AB + (AG x CD/AE)
  DFA = Detection Free Altitude (FT MSL)
  AB = antenna elevation (FT MSL)
  AG = aircraft distance from antenna
  CD = CE - AB = Obstruction height above antenna (ft)
  AE = Obstruction distance from antenna

NOTE:
Flying below the DFA will deny detection by that radar only at the point for which the calculation is
made. Passive detection of aircraft emissions may occur when the aircraft is terrain masked.

A2.21. Pulse Doppler Blind Spot. Calculating a pulse doppler radar blind spot may enable an aircraft
and crew to alter course or groundspeed to fall within the blind spot of a ground or airborne threat radar,
and not be detected by the threat radar. This is calculated by using the blind speed (Doppler notch) of the
threat radar and the groundspeed of one's aircraft. The following example illustrates the determination of
a doppler notch.
   A2.21.1. A threat airborne radar has notch filters that are assessed to be effectively 4-6 KHz. The
   doppler shift at the RF is 25.4 Hz/knot. To determine the notch speeds:
       4000 Hz/25.4 = 157.48157.48/2 = 78.7
       6000 Hz/25.4 = 236.22236.22/2 = 118.1

NOTE:
These figures are divided by 2 to account for 1/2 the bandwidth of the filter notch in which the target is
located. The width of the doppler notch is therefore 78.7 to 118.1 knots, or nominally 100 knots.
   A2.21.2. Calculating Maximum Relative Angle. Given a threat radar's doppler notch and the one's
   aircraft groundspeed, it is possible to calculate the relative angle required for the aircraft to fall within
   the doppler notch and not be detected.

Figure A2.3. Calculating Maximum Relative Angle.




       Y = degrees +/- threat is off beam to be in the doppler notch
       Z = degrees +/- threat is off nose to be in the doppler notch
       Vdn = doppler notch speed
       Vgs = target ground speed

NOTE:
The Vdn already takes the conversion of the filter width to velocity into account. It is calculated based on
one-half of the doppler notch bandwidth for airborne radars. For ground radars, the clutter filter, or
cut-off frequency, should be used.
       A2.21.2.1. Given the threat radar's blind spot and one's aircraft groundspeed, the following for-
       mula can be used to determine the maximum angle to place the threat radar from the beam (off the
       wing) and still be within the doppler notch.
                                       Y = Arcsin (Vdn/Vgs) for Vgs > Vdn.
       A2.21.2.2. Assuming the threat radar is on the aircraft's beam, the following formula may be used
       to find the maximum heading change (left or right) that can be made and still be within the doppler
       notch.
                          Z = Arccos (Vdn/Vgs) or Z = 90 degrees - [Arcsin (Vdn/Vgs)]

   A2.21.3. Calculating Maximum Relative Groundspeed. Given aircraft groundspeed and heading
   (thus relative angle to the threat radar), one can calculate the aircraft's relative speed to the threat
   radar. This relative speed is then compared with the threat radar's doppler notch to see if the aircraft
   falls within the blind spot.
      A2.21.3.1. The following formulas are used to calculate the aircraft's relative speed.
                           Aircraft relative speed = (Cos Z) x Vgs or (Sin Y) x Vgs
      A2.21.3.2. Assuming one's aircraft groundspeed (Vgs) is 200 kts. The threat's doppler notch
      (Vdn) is 110 kts. Angle Z = 40 degrees, or angle Y = 50 degrees.
                        Relative speed = (Cos 40) x 200 kts = .766 x 200 = 154 kts or
                                   (Sin 50) x 200 kts = .766 x 200 = 154 kts
         Relative speed (154 kts) > Doppler notch (110 kts) so the aircraft will be detected. Heading
         and/or groundspeed will have to be adjusted to fall within the blind spot.

A2.22. Rear Vision Devices. Using a rear vision device (a clear bubble mounted in the center overhead
escape hatch) can enhance survivability in a threat environment. It is useful for sighting adversary air-
craft, ground threats, managing formations, and performing search and rescue missions.
      A2.22.1. During the mission planning, the aircraft commander determines who will occupy the bub-
      ble and ensures that the person is briefed on the potential threats.
      A2.22.2. The bubble is equipped with a mounting ring or seal and handles for inflight installation/
      removal if necessary.
      CAUTION: The aircraft will not be pressurized during bubble installation and use. Inflight installa-
      tion is not recommended due to rapid suction of the bubble into the hatch unless mission profile dic-
      tates (e.g., high-low mission profile).
      A2.22.3. Rear Vision Device (Bubble) General Guidance:
         A2.22.3.1. Clean the bubble before flight.
         A2.22.3.2. Do not pressurize with the bubble installed.
         A2.22.3.3. The bubble observer/loadmaster will wear a helmet to prevent injury during evasive
         maneuvers. Used of tinted visor or sunglasses is advisable.
         A2.22.3.4. The bubble observer/loadmaster should plug into the interphone located at the left/
         right forward paratroop door and be on Hot Mic.
         A2.22.3.5. Clock positions should be grease penciled on inside bottom of the bubble.
         A2.22.3.6. Do not leave bubble installed on the ground. Some bubbles may leak and daytime
         sunlight can result in extreme heat and warping of the bubble.
      A2.22.4. The bubble observer/loadmaster should concentrate on the rear hemisphere between the
      three to nine o'clock positions. Use short, precise threat alert calls.
      WARNING: The bubble observer/loadmaster will inform the pilot about terrain clearance when pos-
      sible, especially during turns.
      A2.22.5. Ladder Installation for HC/MC-130P Aircraft. The maintenance ladder is installed to
      give access to the bubble and provide a footrest as well as stability to the bubble operator during flight.
      The ladder should be installed prior to takeoff unless mission profile prevents installation; then it will
      be installed at the earliest opportunity.
         A2.22.5.1. Extend and adjust the height of the ladder to give access to the center overhead escape
         hatch.
         A2.22.5.2. Position the ladder under the center overhead escape hatch and rotate ladder sideways
         to the aircraft.
         A2.22.5.3. Secure the ladder in place using two CGU-1/B 5000 lbs straps, restraining the ladder
         IAW Dash nine criteria.
         CAUTION: Excessive tie down pressure on the ladder will cause warping.
         A2.22.5.4. For the comfort of the bubble opeator/loadmaster, normal dryer hose can be installed
         and taped to the air conditioner vents to direct airflow into the bubble.

NOTE:
The flight engineer will open the ramp and door at 150 KIAS after receiving clearance to open from the
loadmaster, and will report "Indicates Open" when the ramp and door light illuminate.
CAUTION: The flight engineer will monitor and ensure the ramp and door open light on the ADS panel
remains illuminated for the entire drop. Failure of the light to illuminate or remain illuminated constitutes
a no drop condition.
WARNING: If the cargo ramp and door fail to operate normally or the mission dictates, the loadmaster

NOTE:
The flight engineer will open the ramp and door at 150 KIAS after receiving clearance to open from the
loadmaster and will report "Indicates Open" when the ramp and door light illuminate.
CAUTION: The flight engineer will monitor and ensure the ramp and door open light on the ADS panel
remains illuminated for the entire drop. Failure of the light to illuminate or remain illuminated constitutes
a no drop condition.
WARNING: If the cargo ramp and door fail to operate normally or the mission dictates, the loadmaster
may operate them from the aft control panel upon clearance from the pilot and once the lifeline is attached
and adjusted.

The flight engineer will open the ramp and door at 150 KIAS after receiving clearance to open from the
loadmaster and will report "Indicates Open" when the ramp and door light illuminate.
WARNING: If the cargo ramp and door fail to operate normally or the mission dictates, the loadmaster
may operate them from the aft control panel upon clearance from the pilot and once the lifeline is attached
and adjusted.
WARNING: On CRRC and RAMZ drops, parachutists may line up along side the load but will not move
aft of FS 737 (ramp hinge) until the load starts to move.
2. Aft Anchor Cable Supports - Lowered (if required)
CAUTION: Aft Anchor Cable Support will not be lowered until the flight engineer states "Indicates
Open."

NOTE:
Lower the cable when tailgating for personnel, CRRC and RAMZs.
WARNING: From this point on, the loadmaster will not position his hand near the retriever winch
switches. Failure to comply with this may result in early release of the load.
3. Slowdown Checklist -                       "COMPLETE"                                             (LM)(E)

3. Static Line Retriever Rewind Switch - Activated

NOTES:
The loadmaster (upon hearing the oral signal and seeing the green light illuminate) will activate the static
line retriever rewind switch for approximately three seconds.
On aircraft not equipped with a static line retriever, upon hearing and seeing green light, the loadmaster
will manually cut the gate.
WARNING: Loadmasters will not position themselves in the direct line of travel of the retriever cable
and guillotine knife to preclude being struck in the event of a recoil at gate release.
WARNING: If the drop is aborted or if the gate fails to cut after three seconds, release the static line
retriever winch switch, raise the anchor cable supports and request the Engineer close the ramp and door.

NOTES:
After completion of the One-Minute Warning, the secondary loadmaster will be prepared to remove slack
from the static line retriever cable after gate is cut.
If the static line retriever fails at "Green Light", perform a manual gate cut if authorized.

ronment. Follow the navigator's DZ threat update and the ASPO's recommendations if at all possible.
2. Abort the mission and proceed to a location where qualified medical assistance is available.
3. Advise the controlling agency of the emergency and request an ambulance and doctor meet the aircraft.

                              AIR DROP EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
                CONTAINER DELIVERY SYSTEM EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
When notified of a malfunction, extend additional flaps and lower the nose to maintain a slight nose down
attitude until the ramp and door are closed and the load is secured. Maintain drop airspeed and altitude (if
possible) and turn toward the prebriefed salvo area. If the gate fails to release or the load fails to exit, the
loadmaster will take the following corrective actions:
1. Notify the pilot of the                  "MALFUNCTION"
WARNING: After being notified of a malfunction, the pilot will extend additional flaps and establish a
power setting to lower the aircraft pitch attitude and aid in keeping the potentially loose load from exiting
the aircraft.
2. Notify the parachutists (if required) to remain forward and clear of the load.
3. Aft Anchor Cable Supports -Raised (if required).
4. Loadmasters give clearance to "close the ramp and door," and tell the engineer when it's closed and
locked.
WARNING: The loadmaster will ensure that the restraint harness lifeline is attached to a point that will
preclude exiting the aircraft PRIOR to proceeding aft to operate the ramp and door controls.
CAUTION: If the containers are jammed in the ramp area the loadmaster will notify the engineer to stop
closing action when the cargo door is released from the uplocks. After the load is secured and the ramp
area is clear, the loadmaster will close the ramp and door from the aft control panel (if possible).
5. Load - Secured
6. Pilot Notified -           "MALFUNCTION CHECKS COMPLETE"                                               (LM)
7. After securing of load, and emergency actions complete, accomplish the Completion of Drop Check-
list.

                         FOULED/TOWED PARACHUTIST PROCEDURES
1. General. The jumpmaster/safety observer is responsible for watching the fouled parachutist to deter-
mine how the parachutist is entangled. If being towed by anything other than the static line, the jumpmas-
ter or safety will attempt to free the parachutist. If being towed by the static line, the jumpmaster/ safety

observer will recommend to the pilot, through the loadmaster, whether to retrieve or cut the parachutist
free. If all parachutists have exited and there is no safety on board, this responsibility rests with the load-
master. The pilot makes the final decision whether to retrieve or cut the parachutist free. The loadmaster
will initiate retrieval or cut the parachutist's static line on the pilot's command. If the parachutist is fouled
during a paratroop door exit, the first priority is to retrieve, whether the parachutist is conscious or uncon-
scious. If the parachutist cannot be retrieved and indicates consciousness, the parachutist will be cut free.
For a ramp exit, the first priority is to cut the parachutist free if the parachutist indicates consciousness. If
the parachutist is unconscious, does not signal, cannot be observed, or a condition exists that prevents cut-
ting the static line, implement emergency retrieval procedures.
WARNING: There is not an effective or consistently reliable means to manually retrieve a fouled para-
chutist from either the paratroop door or ramp and door. Manual retrieval techniques will vary, depending
upon the scenario, and should be exercised with extreme caution.
2. Altitude Requirements. During training, while towing a fouled parachutist, the pilot will maintain at
least the minimum drop altitude (AGL) for the type parachute being used and the mission employed.
WARNING: Prior to positioning gear and flaps down for a fouled parachutist, aircraft gross weight and
performance capabilities must be considered.
CAUTION: If possible, the pilot will avoid turning the aircraft in the direction of the fouled parachutist.
Turning into the parachutist often starts violent swinging of the parachutist and poses an increased possi-
bility of injury.
3. Parachutist Procedures. The parachutist will indicate consciousness and that his reserve parachute is
ready by maintaining a tight body position and with both hands on his reserve parachute.
4. Aircrew Procedures:
  A. The jumpmaster will stop remaining parachutists and the loadmaster will notify the pilot of a fouled
  parachutist.
  B. For a paratroop door exit only, the pilot will lower the landing gear and set flaps to 100 percent.
  C. The copilot will turn on the red light.
  D. If the pilot's decision is to cut the parachutist free, the loadmaster will cut the parachutist's static line
  on the pilot's command.

NOTE:
If the parachutist is fouled following a ramp exit, it will be necessary to partially rewind the static line
retriever to reach the static line for cutting.
  E. If the decision is to retrieve the parachutist, implement emergency retrieval procedures.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                                 431


                    EMERGENCY PARATROOP RETRIEVAL PROCEDURES
                                              (Paratroop Door)

NOTES:
There are three methods of retrieval for towed parachutist from the left/right paratroop door of the HC/
MC-130 aircraft. The primary retrieval is the Towed Paratrooper Retrieval System (TPRS). The second-
ary method is with the paratroop retrieval bar for aircraft equipped with this system. The third method is
to rig a 5,000 lb. tiedown strap in the paratroop door prior to retrieval.
The maximum allowable weight for a towed paratrooper, without the TPRS, for paratroop door exit is 250
pounds. The limit is 400 pounds when utilizing TPRS (does not apply to combat or actual contingency
missions). Jumpmasters are responsible for parachutist weight restrictions. Use of the Retrieval Sling
Assembly without the roller assembly is authorized for retrieving static lines only. The Retrieval Sling
Assembly together with the Roller Assembly will be used for retrieval of a towed parachutist.
1. TPRS:
  A. Install retriever sling assembly around parachutist static line(s) and pull sling loop tight with
  retrieval sling hook.
  B. Install retriever assist strap (RAS/roller system) around static line(s) under retriever sling assembly
  ensuring quick-snap fittings are re-connected between "A" frame center anchor cable support and
  anchor cable stop at FS 770 on outboard anchor cable.
  C. Fold in jump platform and initiate retrieval.
     (1) If the aircraft has been modified with the slip clutch assembly to the static line retriever winch,
     engage static line retriever winch until it slips. If the retriever clutch slips prior to bringing the para-
     chutist into the paratroop door area, determine and remove the cause of the overload, slightly unwind
     the static line retriever winch to reset the winch's slip clutch, and continue retrieval operation.
     WARNING: During retrieval attempts, take all possible action to ensure the parachutist does not
     slip back at any time. This does not preclude unwinding the static line retriever to reset the slip
     clutch, if necessary.
     (2) Stop retrieval when the cotton sleeve at the apex of the D-bags begins to pass through the RAS.
  D. As the parachutist is pulled up to the door, swing parachutist into the aircraft by hand, close and
  secure paratroop door.
     (1) If the parachutist is not in the paratroop door, (e.g., positioned in the lower aft corner of the para-
     troop door) it will become necessary to pull the D-bags manually through the RAS. The primary
     loadmaster maintains control of the static line retriever pistol grip. The secondary loadmaster (if
     available) or safety observer/jumpmaster (if also onboard) routes D-bags through the RAS.
     WARNING: All personnel should remain clear of the paratroop door and line of travel of the static
     line retriever cable until the parachutist has been retrieved into the door.
     (2) After D-bags have been brought into the aircraft, manually pull them far enough forward so as
     not to interfere with the remaining retrieval.
     (3) As the parachutist is pulled up to the paratroop door, swing parachutist into the aircraft by hand,
     close and lock paratroop door.

  E. After retrieving the parachutist, reset flaps to 50 percent, raise the landing gear, and accomplish the
  completion of drop checklist.
2. Paratroop Retrieval Bar:
  A. Install the parachutist retrieval bar in the paratroop door. One end of the bar is inserted in the retain-
  ing bracket on the aft portion of the door frame. The other end of the bar is then carefully raised and
  inserted on the forward portion on the door frame.
  B. Fold in the jump platform.
  C. Using the static line retriever, retrieve the static lines over the bar.
  D. The loadmaster initiates retrieval using the static line retriever winch.
  WARNING: During retrieval attempts, take all possible action to ensure the parachutist does not slip
  back at any time. This does not preclude unwinding the static line retriever to reset the slip clutch, if
  necessary.
      (1) Stop retrieval when the cotton sleeve at the apex of the D-bags begins to pass over the paratroop
      retrieval bar.
  E. As the parachutist is pulled up to the door, swing parachutist into the aircraft by hand.
      (1) If the parachutist is not in the paratroop door, (e.g., positioned in the lower aft corner of the para-
      troop door) it will become necessary to pull the D-bags manually through the opening between the
      retrieval bar and the paratroop door. The primary loadmaster maintains control of the static line
      retriever pistol grip. The secondary loadmaster (if available) or safety observer/jumpmaster (if also
      onboard) routes the D-bags through the opening.
      WARNING: All personnel should remain clear of the paratroop door and line of travel of the static
      line retriever cable until the parachutist has been retrieved into the door.
      (2) Once D-bags have been brought into the aircraft, manually pull them far enough forward so as
      not to interfere with the remaining retrieval.

NOTE:
When the parachutist is in the door area and is being controlled by the loadmaster/safety observer/jump-
master, slightly unwind the static line retriever to relieve tension on the static line so the parachutist may
be brought into the aircraft.
  F. After retrieving the parachutist, reset flaps to 50 percent, raise the landing gear, and accomplish the
  completion of drop checklist.
3. 5,000 lb. Tiedown Strap:
  A. The loadmaster folds the jump platform in.
  B. Install a 5,000 lb. tiedown strap across the paratroop door by threading the hook end of the strap
  behind the one-inch tubular brace located at FS 737, across the door under all static lines, and behind
  the one-inch tubular brace at FS 700. Secure the hook end of the tiedown strap to a tiedown ring for-
  ward of FS 700 and ratchet end to any convenient tiedown ring aft of FS 737. Remove as much slack
  as possible.

 WARNING: Use extreme caution when routing 5,000 lb. strap over the oxygen regulators located at
 FS 740 left and right side.
 C. Push the static lines to the top of the paratroop door and remove additional slack in the tiedown strap
 by using the ratchet.
 D. Follow the procedures as indicated in the paratroop retrieval bar method starting with step 2c.

                       EMERGENCY PARATROOP RETRIEVAL PROCEDURES
                                               (Ramp and Door)

NOTE:
It will be necessary to partially retrieve the static line with the static line retriever to reach the line for cut-
ting. If the parachutist does not signal, cannot be observed, or a condition exists that prevents cutting the
static line, implement emergency retrieval procedures.
1. Aircraft Not Modified with Quick-Retrieval Tiedown Rings:
  A. Thread the hook end of a 5,000 lb. tiedown strap, front to rear, around the right vertical support
  member at FS 840 approximately 5 1/2 feet above the ramp in the ADS position.
  B. Attach the hook end into the strap and draw taut.
  C. Run the ratchet end of the strap across the ramp and thread it, front to rear, around the left vertical
  -support member at FS 840.
  D. Remove all slack from the strap and attach the ratchet end to any convenient tiedown ring forward
  of FS 840. Ratchet the strap until taut.
  E. Using the static line retriever, retrieve the static lines over the strap and as the parachutist is pulled
  up to the ramp, bring parachutist into the aircraft by hand under the strap.
  WARNING: The last 5 feet are the most crucial for the fouled parachutist. A wildly oscillating para-
  chutist usually strikes the aircraft ramp head first. If the parachutist is oscillating violently, it may
  become necessary to stop the retrieval momentarily, allowing the parachutist to stabilize, then continue
  with the retrieval. Repeat these stops continually, if required.

NOTE:
After the parachutist is pulled up to the ramp and is being controlled by the jumpmaster/safety observer/
loadmaster, slightly unwind the static line retriever to relieve tension on the line so the parachutist may be
brought into the aircraft.
  F. After retrieving the parachutist, accomplish the completion of drop checklist.
  CAUTION: For aircraft equipped with ramp air deflectors, after the jumper has been successfully
  retrieved and secured, remove the 5000 pound strap prior to closing the aft cargo door and ramp. Fail-
  ure to do so will cause the ramp air deflectors to contact the strap causing damage to the aircraft or the
  strap to break.
2. Aircraft Modified with Quick-Retrieval Tiedown Rings:
  A. Attach hook end of the pre-positioned 5,000-pound tiedown strap to the tiedown ring on the side of
  the aircraft from which the parachutist is being towed. Attach the ratchet end of the tiedown strap to the
  opposite tiedown ring and ratchet until two turns of webbing are around the spindle and strap is taut.
  B. Emergency retrieval tiedown strap will be pre-measured and excess taped prior to take-off. S-fold
  the excess strap and tape near the ratchet end of the strap with pressure-sensitive tape. Pre-measure
  strap so that with both ends connected to the tiedown rings and two wraps around the spindle, the
  excess strap remains securely taped. Pre-position strap so that it is accessible if needed prior to
  take-off.

  C. Using the static-line retriever, retrieve the static lines over the strap and as the parachutist is pulled
  up to the ramp, bring the parachutist into the aircraft by hand underneath the strap.
  WARNING: The last five feet are the most crucial for the fouled parachutist. A wildly oscillating
  parachutist usually strikes the aircraft ramp head first. If the parachutist is oscillating violently, it may
  become necessary to stop the retrieval momentarily, allowing the parachutist to stabilize, then continue
  with the retrieval. Repeat these stops continually, if required.

NOTE:
After the parachutist is pulled up to the ramp and is being controlled by the jumpmaster/safety observer/
loadmaster, slightly unwind the static line retriever to relieve tension on the line so the parachutist may be
brought into the aircraft.
3. There is no effective, dependable, nor consistently reliable means to manually retrieve a towed para-
chutist from the paratroop door or ramp and door. Manually retrieving a parachutist is a last resort. Man-
ual retrieval techniques vary, depending on the scenario, and should be used with extreme caution.

                       MANUAL STATIC LINE RETRIEVAL PROCEDURES
                                             (Paratroop Door)

NOTE:
During combat, cut static lines which cannot be retrieved. On other than combat missions, if the static
line retriever fails during retrieval and more than 10/20 static lines are to be retrieved from the paratroop
door, manually retrieve the static lines by using a 5,000 lb tiedown strap.
1. Secure the hook end to a point forward enough in the cargo compartment to permit static lines to enter
completely into the aircraft.
2. Insert the other end of the strap from the bottom up, making a "U" around the static lines.
3. Pull the strap forward to retrieve the static lines into the aircraft. Loadmasters may require assistance
to pull the strap forward.

                       MANUAL STATIC LINE RETRIEVAL PROCEDURES

                                             (Ramp and Door)
If the static line retriever fails following a combination/tailgate drop, use the following procedures using
the Prusik Knot:
1. Take a 30 inch piece of 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord that is tied in a loop. Loop the cord around the
static line retriever winch cable as shown in the figure. Use a minimum of three wraps around the
retriever cable to ensure locking of the 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord.
2. Pull to tighten the knot around the retriever winch cable to prevent slipping. Attach the hook end of a
5,000 lb. tiedown strap into the loop's end and pull in the static lines. The 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord will
remain locked in place under tension.
3. More than one 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord may be attached to the winch cable using the Prusik Knot
to facilitate static line retrieval. The Prusik Knot may be adjusted up or down the cable as required. The
knot will not slip as long as it is wrapped tightly with a minimum of three turns (more wraps equal more
friction), and tension is applied.
4. To prevent cutting the 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord with the hook on the 5,000 lb. tiedown strap, a car-
abiner may be attached to the 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord loop and the hook attached to carabiner.
