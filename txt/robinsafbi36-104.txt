1. General.
   1.1. The vo-tech co-op program is utilized to develop and train a knowledgeable and skilled work-
   force. The vo-tech co-op training program is a 24-month program (reference Attachment 1, Conver-
   sion Chart), consisting of a minimum of 12 months (normally, two 6-month periods) of academic
   study at participating schools and a minimum of 12 months (normally, two 6-month periods) of

           schedule, TAA employee master record and DCPS records must match at the time of biweekly
           payroll processing.
       3.1.4. Leave Benefits. For each 20 hours worked, the student earns 1 hour of sick leave and 1 hour
       of annual leave. To determine leave benefits, students with prior military service will contact
       WR-ALC/DP Customer Service, ext. 2-0601 or 2-0602.

       3.1.6. Holiday Pay. If a holiday falls on a student’s normal workday, the student will be eligible
       for holiday pay for the scheduled work hours if he/she is on pay status the day before or the day
       after the holiday. The student’s part-time work schedule will be fixed and cannot be changed
       unless permanently changed and will be based on school/study needs of the student. Changes will
       not be made to receive holiday pay, and part-time students are not allowed to have an “in lieu of
       holiday’’ day off (unless directed by the base commander). Students will only be paid for the
       amount of hours normally scheduled to work; e.g., if a student’s normal workday is 6 hours, he/she
       will only receive 6 hours pay for a holiday. Students working a full-time schedule are entitled to
       have an “in lieu of holiday” when a holiday falls on a non-work day.

       3.1.7. Life Insurance. New Federal employees are automatically enrolled in Basic life insurance
       effective the first day in a pay and duty status. If Basic insurance is not wanted, action must be
       taken to waive it. If waived before the end of the first pay period, no premiums will be withheld.
       Optional life insurance coverage is not automatic – action must be taken to elect it. Basic insur-
       ance must be attained in order to be eligible for Optional insurance. Optional insurance must be
       requested within 31 days from the date of hire. Optional insurance is effective the date the election
       is submitted. No proof of insurability is required for the Basic insurance at the time of hire, or for
       any Optional insurance during the first 31 days of employment. Use Employee Benefits Informa-
       tion System or Benefits and Entitlements Service Team (BEST) phone (1-800-616-3775) to elect
       or waive Basic and Optional insurance.
       3.1.8. Health Benefits. Vocational co-op students are eligible to participate in the employees’
       health insurance program. NOTE: Part-time employees’ health insurance will cost more, depend-
       ing on how many hours worked. While part-time, employees pay their share of the insurance pre-
       mium as well as a prorated share of what the government would pay a full-time employee. If in
       LWOP status, they pay the full cost.
Example (per pay period):
               Student’s Share        Government Share                 Total
Full-Time         $ 48.68                 $141.92                      $190.60
Part-time (64 hrs) $ 77.06                $113.54                      $190.60
(40 hrs)           $119.64                $ 70.96                      $190.60
LWOP               $190.60                   0                         $190.60
(These are only illustrative amounts, not actual costs.)
       If the co-op goes on LWOP, he/she has two options: pay his/her premium direct or defer the
       accrued premiums until in full-time/OJT status. The Web site at http://ask.afpc.randolph.af.mil/
       best/default.asp?prods3=272&prods2=264&prods1=44 provides information on how to make
       the direct premium payment and gives students a choice as to the percentage they will repay each
       payday on an accrued debt.
       3.1.9. Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). If the student is eligible for a thrift savings account as a full-time
       employee, he/she will continue to have contributions matched as a part-time employee. For enroll-
       ment, students will call the BEST telephone automated system at 1-800-616-3775.
       3.1.10. Time and Attendance Policy. Co-ops will only be allowed to work established schedules.
       Part-time students would be entitled to overtime pay or compensatory time provided they work
       more than 8 hours in a day or more than 40 hours in an administrative workweek. As a matter of
       policy, part-time students should not be allowed to work overtime or compensatory time.
       Part-time employees are entitled to night differential pay if a majority of their hours are worked
       during a period in which a night shift differential is payable.
       3.1.11. Academic Schedule. The academic schedule takes priority. If a student is informed by his/
       her instructor of exams/tests for the following day, he/she will request leave from the supervisor if
       he/she needs to take leave or LWOP to study. The student may also request a change to LWOP at
       any time for the remainder of the (approximate) 6-month cycle.

        3.1.12. Working Less than Schedule. If a student works less than his/her schedule dictates, leave
        will be requested or LWOP shall be charged. LWOP shall be coded “KA” in the timekeeping sys-
        tem. Note. If LWOP is taken excessively while in full-time status, it could affect within grade
        increases and service computation dates (SCD).
        3.1.13. Probation. Co-ops are on probation until completion of the program and conversion to
        full-time. Both full-time and part-time hours worked count toward their SCD.

        4.2.1. Annual leave and sick leave will accrue at the rate of 4 hours sick leave and 4 hours annual
        leave per pay period. A student may earn compensatory time when approved by the supervisor.
        While in OJT/full-time status, a student is authorized to work overtime when approved by the
        supervisor. Prior military students will contact their personnel office to determine if their military
        time served will add additional leave.
        4.2.2. If a student does not report to work as scheduled, he/she must be on approved leave (annual,
        sick, LWOP, etc.). Failure to get approval for leave IAW DoD Financial Management Regulation
