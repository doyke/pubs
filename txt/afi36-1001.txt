SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum to Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-1001,
         Managing the Civilian Performance Program

       By order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Air Force Guidance Memorandum
(AFGM) immediately changing AFI 36-1001, Managing the Civilian Performance Program.
Compliance with this memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent
with other Air Force publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI 33-
360, Publications and Forms Management.

        This AFGM eliminates Civilian Promotion Appraisal Factor Ratings. Upon
implementation of the resume-based single staffing tool (USA Staffing), the nine Appraisal
Factors, as well as the whole person score and skills codes, were eliminated from the staffing
process. As the nine appraisal factors no longer have value in the staffing process and are not
approved for any other purpose, they are now obsolete. AF Form 860A is updated to delete Part
F Civilian Promotion Appraisal.

        Prior to implementing this AFGM, ensure local bargaining obligations are met. Send
policy questions to the Civilian Force Policy Division, AF/A1PC
(af.a1pc.workflow@pentagon.af.mil). Direct operational questions to the Program Management
and Support Division, AFPC/DPIE (afpcdpie.workflow@randolph.af.mil).

        Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records,
and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in
the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS).
    The policy in this Memorandum becomes void one year from the date of this Memorandum,
or upon incorporation by interim change to, or a rewrite of AFI 36-1001, Managing the Civilian
Performance Program, whichever is earlier.

                                        Guidance Changes

The below changes to AFI 36-1001, dated 1 July 1999, are effective immediately.

(Delete) 1.2.2.

(Replace Existing) 2.6.2. When it is not feasible to extend the appraisal period, for
administrative purposes, extend the last rating of record for 1 year (this is not a rating of record
for RIF, appraisal rating type code is E).

(Replace Existing) 2.6.2.1. If the employee’s absence continues in subsequent years, an
administrative rating of assumed Acceptable is assigned (this is not a rating of record for RIF,
appraisal rating type code is F). In the case of employees on LWOP-US, this applies for the
length of the active duty tour or until the employee’s restoration rights have expired, whichever
occurs first.

(Delete) Chapter 7, USING FACTOR RATINGS ON THE CIVILIAN PROMOTION
APPRAISAL FOR COMPETITIVE PROMOTION AND INSERVICE PLACEMENT

          PERFORMANCE PLANNING, MONITORING AND DEVELOPING

1.1. Air Force Policy. The Air Force depends upon a large civilian work force to accomplish
its various missions. Managing this work force requires an effective program for planning,
monitoring, developing, evaluating, and rewarding individual and organizational performance.
Terms and definitions relating to this program are at Attachment 1.
   1.1.1. General schedule (GS), federal wage system (FWS), senior level (SL), and scientific
   and professional (ST) employees are covered by this program (Attachment 2).
1.2. Program Summary. The appraisal period in the Air Force is 1 April through 31 March.
The Air Force program requires written performance plans containing critical position
performance elements and standards for evaluation of overall performance for the position. AF
Form 860, Civilian Performance Plan or AF Form 1003, Core Personnel Document (CPD) are
used for this purpose. A discussion of the performance plan at the beginning of the appraisal
period is required, as well as at least one progress review, normally at the midpoint of the
appraisal period (AF Form 860B, Civilian Progress Review Worksheet, will be used). At the end
of the appraisal period, employees are rated using the AF Form 860A, Civilian Rating of Record,
and assigned an appropriate summary rating of record. If employees are rated ―Unacceptable‖
on any critical element(s), the supervisor is required to take other actions (Chapter 5).
   1.2.1. Recognition for performance in the form of an award is not automatic. Awards may
   be approved using the AF Form 860A, Part D.
   1.2.2. The Civilian Promotion Appraisal (AF Form 860A, Part F) is completed at the end of
   the appraisal period.
   1.2.3. The following is a summary of the forms required by the program, and the appropriate
   paragraph in which to find additional information:
       1.2.3.1. AF Form 860, Civilian Performance Plan or AF Form 1003, Core Personnel
       Document: Paragraph 1.5.
       1.2.3.2. AF Form 860A, Civilian Rating of Record: Paragraph 2.7., Table 2.1., Table
       2.2., and Table 2.3..
       1.2.3.3. AF Form 860B, Civilian Progress Review Worksheet: Paragraph 1.8..
1.3. Planning Performance. Performance plans spell out expectations for employees based on
position requirements. They may be written as part of a CPD and may be tailored at local
discretion to meet mission needs. The AF Form 860 may be used to record performance plans
not covered by a CPD. The performance plan is a result of a thorough review of position
requirements and any oral or written input from the employee.
1.4. Team, Group, or Organizational Performance Elements. Team or group performance
may be addressed in the following way:
   1.4.1. Additional Performance Element. Team, group, or organizational performance may
   be included as a performance plan additional element (paragraph 1.5.2.).
 6                                                                     AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999


     1.4.2. Individual’s Contribution to a Team. Performance plan critical elements may address
     the individual employee’s contribution to a team or organization.
1.5. Steps in Developing the Performance Plan.
     1.5.1. Determine Critical Performance Elements. At least one critical element addressing
     individual performance must be included in the performance plan, but more may be
     necessary (normally not more than 7). A critical element is a work assignment or
     responsibility of such importance that unacceptable performance on the element would result
     in a determination that an employee’s overall performance is unacceptable. NOTE: Non-
     critical elements are not permitted. Accordingly, non-critical elements in plans must be
     reviewed and eliminated, made additional elements, or modified to be critical (to include
     incorporation with a current critical element).
     1.5.2. Determine Additional Performance Elements. Additional elements may be included
     in the performance plan. They are a dimension or aspect of individual, team, or
     organizational performance that is not a critical element. These elements cannot be used in
     assigning a summary level rating of record, but are useful for communicating performance
     expectations. They may include, but are not limited to, objectives, goals, and other means of
     expressing expected performance. A written standard is not required for an additional
     element.
     1.5.3. Determine Performance Evaluation Requirements. Required items for performance
     plans, whether they are included as separate stand-alone performance elements or are
     incorporated as a portion of other elements, and the employees to whom they apply, are at
     Attachment 3.
     1.5.4. Establish Performance Standards. Performance standards must be developed for each
     critical performance element, defining at least acceptable performance. They may address
     characteristics of performance such as quality, quantity, timeliness or work behaviors.
     1.5.5. Involve the Employee. Before the rating official signs the performance plan, the rating
     official should ensure the employee has had an opportunity to provide feedback concerning
     the plan (supervisors ultimately decide which elements and standards to include). The rating
     official then signs and dates the form.
     1.5.6. Obtaining Approval by Reviewing Official. The plan is submitted to the reviewing
     official, who approves and signs the plan. The reviewing official has the authority to change
     the plan.
1.6. Discussion. Once the plan is approved, the rating official should discuss the plan with the
employee. The employee signs and dates the form acknowledging receipt of the plan. If the
employee refuses to sign the form, the rating official writes, ―Employee chose not to sign,‖ on
the form and dates the form.
1.7. Disposition of Form. The employee is given a copy of the performance plan. The rating
official retains the original of the performance plan in the Employee Performance File (EPF)
(paragraph 8.2.).
1.8. Monitoring the Performance Plan and Progress Review. Performance plans cover the
Air Force appraisal period which runs from 1 April to 31 March. The rating official and
employee meet at the beginning of each appraisal period to discuss the employee’s approved
AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999                                                                         7


performance elements and standards in the plan. A copy is provided to the employee. Further
progress reviews and discussions during the appraisal period keep the performance elements
current and allow rating officials to make changes to the performance plan, as appropriate.
   1.8.1. When a rating official or employee is newly assigned, and at the beginning of each
   appraisal period, the performance plan will be reviewed and discussed (normally within 30
   calendar days). It may be revised and signed as appropriate.
   1.8.2. At least one progress review of the employee’s performance against all the elements
   of the performance plan will take place during the appraisal period, normally at the midpoint.
   AF Form 860B will be used to document this review and may be filled out prior to and/or
   during the review with the employee. Use of this form is mandatory. It facilitates the
   communication on performance. The progress review is a private communication between
   rating official and employee. The process is intended for employee development and to help
   the individual. The employee should be made aware the progress review is meant to provide
   feedback on performance that may impact the rating of record at the end of the appraisal
   period. A copy of the form is provided to the employee. The original is retained by the rating
   official in the EPF.
   1.8.3. If ongoing performance problems are anticipated, the rater should contact a personnel
   specialist, who is available to assist the rater in helping the employee improve performance.
   The specialist may assist in determining whether more extensive documentation is necessary
   and may suggest a course of action.
1.9. Developing Performance. Rating officials determine whether training or other
developmental opportunities would help an employee perform better on the job. Monitoring
performance should help identify remedial or developmental training necessary for an employee
to meet a specified performance standard. Rating officials may include training requirements or
assignments which focus on improving future performance in a career enhancement plan (AFI
36-401, Employee Training and Development).

                              PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

2.1. Performance Evaluation and Ratings of Record. A rating of record is assigned upon
completion of the annual appraisal period and to support a within-grade increase action. An
administrative rating is assigned at the time the rating official decides to render an evaluation
―out-of-cycle‖ (appraisal rating type code is O) because an employee is performing unacceptably
on one or more critical elements of the performance plan, or the rating is necessary to support a
personnel action such as a career ladder promotion (Table 2.1.). The employee must have
performed in the official position for 90 days or more and be appraised against the elements of a
performance plan to be assigned a rating. When an annual rating of record (appraisal rating type
code is A) cannot be prepared at the end of the appraisal period because the employee was not in
the position for at least 90 days, the appraisal period should be extended until the employee has
been in the position for 90 days. This includes employees on workers’ compensation, extended
sick leave or leave without pay who have not worked for at least 90 days during the appraisal
period. When the 90-day period ends, the rating should be prepared within 30 days. Input from
previous supervisors or transferred ratings covering an employee’s performance within the
current appraisal period will be taken into consideration when deriving the next rating of record
(Table 2.2. and Table 2.3.).
     2.1.1. The rating of a disabled veteran shall not be lowered because the veteran has been
     absent from work to seek medical treatment (5 CFR 430.208(f)).
2.2. Summary Rating Level Pattern. The Air Force Performance Appraisal Program uses
summary level pattern ―A‖ in assigning a rating of record to each employee. Under the patterns
in Table 2.1., Level 1 through Level 5 are ordered categories for federal performance
management programs, with Level 1 as the lowest and Level 5 as the highest.

Table 2.1. Summary Levels and Patterns for Federal Agencies.

2.3. Evaluating Performance Elements. The rating official determines if the employee met or
did not meet the standards for each element, and rates the employee ―Does not meet‖ or ―Meets‖
on each element. If an employee is rated ―Does not Meet‖ on any critical element, the rating is
Unacceptable. An Unacceptable rating of record grants no additional years of reduction-in-force
(RIF) retention credit. If all critical elements are rated ―Meets,‖ the rating is Acceptable. An
AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999                                                                             9


Acceptable rating of record grants 12 or 20 additional years of RIF retention credit, depending on
whether a single rating pattern or multiple rating pattern exists, respectively (5 CFR 351.504).
2.4. Distribution of Ratings. Forced distribution of summary ratings of record is prohibited.
2.5. Appraising Temporary Duty Performance. When an employee is temporarily assigned
for 120 days or more (for example, on detail or temporary promotion), the temporary rating
official gives the employee a written performance plan reflecting the temporary assignment as
soon as possible. At the end of the temporary assignment, the temporary rating official rates the
employee’s performance on the elements and forwards the information to the permanent rating
official. The permanent rating official considers the input received from the temporary rating
official in completing the employee’s next rating of record.
   2.5.1. When an employee is on temporary assignment for 90 days or more and the annual
   appraisal is due, the temporary rating official completes the rating of record.
   2.5.2. If an annual appraisal is due and the detail or temporary promotion has lasted for
   fewer than 90 days, the permanent rating official completes the rating, but consults with the
   temporary rating official.
2.6. Appraising Performance Under Other Circumstances. In order to be assigned a rating
of record, an employee must have performed in the official position for 90 days or more during
the appraisal period and be appraised against the elements of a performance plan. Employees
such as those on long-term full-time training (LTFT), leave without pay-uniformed service
(LWOP-US), or Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) assignments must meet this criteria in
order to be assigned a rating of record at the end of the appraisal period.
   2.6.1. If an employee has not worked at least 90 calendar days against an approved
   performance plan during the appraisal period, the appraisal period should be extended when
   feasible until the 90-day requirement has been satisfied. When the 90-day period ends, the
   rating should be prepared within 30 days.
   2.6.2. When it is not feasible to extend the appraisal period, for administrative purposes,
   extend the last rating of record and merit promotion factors for one year (this is not a rating
   of record for RIF, appraisal rating type code is E).
       2.6.2.1. If the employee’s absence continues in subsequent years, an administrative
       rating of assumed Acceptable is assigned (this is not a rating of record for RIF, appraisal
       rating type code is F). In this circumstance, the rating and reviewing officials of record
       for the official position may retain the last promotion appraisal factor scores (as opposed
       to the assignment of ―5s‖ after the first year). In the case of employees on LWOP-US,
       this applies for the length of the active duty tour or until the employee’s restoration rights
       have expired, whichever occurs first.
       2.6.2.2. In situations involving long-term training, managers may develop a performance
       plan related to the training. The plan could include critical elements related to
       achievement of specific training objectives.
2.7. Steps in Completing AF Form 860A, Civilian Rating of Record.
   2.7.1. Rate the Performance Elements. The rating official fills out and completes the AF
   Form 860A, Civilian Rating of Record within 30 days after the end of the appraisal period.
10                                                                    AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999


  2.7.2. Assign a Rating of Record. A rating of record is derived from the results of the
  appraisal of the performance plan elements (paragraph 2.3.).
  2.7.3. Develop Impact on Mission Accomplishment Statements (AFPAM 36-1003, Civilian
  Appraisal Impact on Mission Accomplishment Statements). Must be completed for GS-
  14s/15s. Optional for other grades. List in bullet format the employee’s specific
  contributions to the unit’s mission—what did the employee do, how well was it done, and
  what impact it had on mission accomplishment. This information will be used in GS-15
  screening boards.
  2.7.4. Determine Award, As Appropriate. An award recognizing high levels of performance
  may be recommended at the end of the appraisal period in conjunction with the annual
  performance rating in accordance with each commander’s award program. Awards are not
  given automatically. Justification for an award is submitted on AF Form 860A, Part C in
  bullet format. The justification will address accomplishments in the employee’s position.
     2.7.4.1. Performance cash awards may be granted as a percentage of the employee’s
     basic salary (not more than 10% without Secretary of the Air Force approval and not
     more than $10,000 without OPM approval), or as a specific dollar amount. AF Form
     2858, Performance Award, is available for optional preparation and presentation by the
     presenting organization.
     2.7.4.2. Quality Step Increases (QSI). GS employees at or above step 4 of their grade
     may be considered for QSIs. Criteria is at paragraph 2.8..
     2.7.4.3. Time-off awards may also be recommended using the AF Form 860A.
     2.7.4.4. A combination of a performance cash award and time-off award may be granted
     to an employee.
  2.7.5. Certify. The rating official certifies the form by signing and dating it in Part E.
  2.7.6. Obtain Approval of Reviewing Official. The rating official provides the completed
  form to the reviewing official for approval and signature/date. The reviewing official has the
  authority to change the rating and award.
  2.7.7. Ensure Quality Control. Commanders should establish a quality control process to
  ensure accurate completion of the appraisal process.
  2.7.8. Discuss the Rating. After obtaining any required approvals, the rating official
  discusses the rating with the employee. The employee signs and dates the form
  acknowledging receipt of the appraisal. If the employee refuses to sign the form, the rating
  official writes, ―Employee chose not to sign,‖ on the form and dates the form.
  2.7.9. Disposition of AF Form 860A. Whether or not the employee signs the form, the
  employee is given a copy. After following local procedures for documenting the rating in the
  Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS), the rating official retains the original
  form in the EPF, maintained along with the AF Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief, in
  the supervisor’s employee work folder, or follows local procedures, as appropriate.
   AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999                                                                            11


   2.8. Quality Step Increases (QSI).
      2.8.1. An employee who receives a QSI must display the highest quality performance,
      significantly above that ordinarily found in the type of position to which the employee is
      assigned. The award justification will describe specific accomplishments that demonstrate
      sustained exemplary performance, well above normal expectations. The employee must have
      a current rating of record at the highest level (―Acceptable‖) at the time the QSI is made
      effective.
      2.8.2. Recommendations for QSIs must be accomplished in conjunction with the annual
      performance rating. Charge a minimum of 3 percent of the employee’s salary against the
      awards budget for each QSI.
      2.8.3. Employees may receive only one QSI at the same grade level in a three-year period,
      unless an exception is approved at MAJCOM or equivalent level. In any case, a QSI may not
      be granted to an employee who has received a QSI in the previous 52-week period.
      2.8.4. A QSI and performance cash award are not approved for the same period of
      performance. The QSI should be made effective as soon as practicable after it is approved
      and the employee meets all eligibility requirements. The effective date may be delayed only
      to give a greater advantage to the recipient, e.g., to allow a regular step increase to step 7 to
      be processed first. However, the delay should not exceed four pay periods.
      2.8.5. AF Form 2857, Quality Step Increase, is available for optional preparation and
      presentation by the presenting organization.
   2.9. Related Personnel Actions. Performance appraisals rendered under this program shall be
   used as a basis for taking appropriate personnel actions in accordance with applicable provisions
   of law and regulation.

                          PROBATION FOR NEW EMPLOYEES

3.1. Basic Probation Requirements. Employees who receive a career or career-conditional
appointment, and who have not previously completed probation serve a one-year probationary
period. This probation extends and continues the merit system competitive examining process
for initial entry into federal civilian service. During probation, supervisors evaluate the new
employee for qualities and characteristics essential to effective performance, but which pre-
employment testing and examination methods do not adequately measure. An employee who
does not satisfactorily complete the probation must be assigned to another position or separated.
3.2. Evaluating Factors. This instruction sets guidelines for evaluating job performance and
work behavior. The supervisor also evaluates the probationer's character, conduct, and attitude
that directly affect job performance.
3.3. Certifying Completion of Probation. The supervisor certifies the probationer's
performance in writing, normally no later than during the 10th month of the probation.
   3.3.1. The CPF advises the supervisor of this requirement with a notice from DCPDS.
   3.3.2. The supervisor completes the certification through supervisory channels, sends it to
   the CPF, and retains a copy in AF Form 971, unless the determination is unsatisfactory.
   3.3.3. If the supervisor does not recommend keeping the employee, the supervisor must
   contact the CPF as soon as possible before the probationary period ends for guidance on the
   proper course of action.
   3.3.4. If the supervisor does not complete the certification process on time, an employee may
   pass probation by default.
3.4. When Employee Fails Probation.
   3.4.1. Assign an employee who fails the probationary period to another position only:
       3.4.1.1. When enough time remains in the probationary period to determine fitness in the
       new position and the federal service.
       3.4.1.2. Where good reason exists to believe the employee will successfully complete the
       continued probation.
   3.4.2. A supervisor who decides that change-to-lower grade (CLG) or separation is
   appropriate for the employee consults with the CPF staff and issues a notice of the action.
   3.4.3. A probationer has no right to adverse action benefits provided by law or OPM
   governing rules. Procedures in 5 U.S.C., chapters 43 and 75, are inappropriate in CLG or
   separation of a probationer.
   3.4.4. A supervisor who decides to terminate a probationer based in whole or in part on
   conditions arising before appointment must comply with the requirements of 5 CFR 315.805
   and 1201.21.
 14                                                                       AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999


3.5. Notice of Action. The supervisor:
   3.5.1. Notifies the probationer in writing of the intended action to demote or separate.
   3.5.2. Signs and sends the notice to the probationer as far in advance as possible before the
   effective date.
   3.5.3. The notice must include:
       3.5.3.1. What will be done and the action's effective date.
       3.5.3.2. Specific, detailed reasons sufficient to conclude that the probationer is unlikely
       to give subsequent satisfactory service.
       3.5.3.3. Information on how the probationer may ask for an official review of the action.
       3.5.3.4. The name and official address of the reviewer.
       3.5.3.5. The probationer's duty status until the effective date.
       3.5.3.6. Information that the probationer may appeal to the MSPB only based on:
           3.5.3.6.1. Alleged partisan political reasons or marital status (5 CFR 315.806(b)).
           3.5.3.6.2. Improper procedure (5 CFR 315.806(c)).
           3.5.3.6.3. Discrimination, if raised in addition to one of the two issues above, (5 CFR
           315.806(d)).
   3.5.4. Give the employee a reasonable time: To file a written response to the notice and to
   furnish affidavits that support the response.
   3.5.5. The notice must meet the requirements of 5 CFR 1201.21.
   3.5.6. A probationer may file the petition for appeal to the MSPB any time from the day
   after the effective date of the action until 30 calendar days after the effective date.
   3.5.7. The supervisor must set a time limit for the probationer's response.         Unless the
   probationary period ends sooner, allow at least 3 working days.
3.6. Reviewing the Action. At the probationer's request, the reviewing official determines if the
action is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable in view of the documentation and other
information provided by the supervisor relative to required performance, conduct, behavior, and
attitude. The probationer receives notice in writing of the reviewing official's decision.
AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999                                                                         15


                                           Chapter 4

               PROBATION FOR NEW SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS

4.1. Probation Requirements. New supervisors and managers must serve a probationary
period the first time they start a permanent supervisory or managerial position in the competitive
service (supervisory status codes 1, 2, or 3).
   4.1.1. The employee serves a probationary period on receiving an initial managerial
   assignment unless the selecting official waives the requirement based on the employee's
   previous satisfactory completion of a supervisory probationary period.
   4.1.2. When the initial assignment is both supervisory and managerial, an employee must
   complete a single probationary period.
4.2. Exceptions.
   4.2.1. An employee who, as of 11 August 1979, was serving or had served for any length of
   time in a federal civilian supervisory or managerial position, need not serve a comparable
   probationary period under this chapter.
   4.2.2. Temporary service (temporary appointment, promotion, or reassignment) as a
   supervisor or manager before 11 August 1979, counts if the employee officially held the
   position for more than 120 calendar days. Service while on detail or in an acting capacity
   does not count.
       4.2.2.1. Employees must give evidence of current or prior federal civilian supervisory or
       managerial experience using official records or other evidence supplied by the employee
       or a federal official.
4.3. Advance Notification. Inform the employee about the probationary period in writing
before assignment to a supervisory or managerial position.
   4.3.1. Include information on the entitlement to placement if the employee does not
   satisfactorily complete the probation, and the absence of appeal rights over such placement.
   4.3.2. Recruitment notices and vacancy announcements must explain these requirements and
   entitlements.
4.4. Training. Ensure that mandatory supervisory training requirements, identified in AFI 36-
401, are met and determine if any additional training is required.
4.5. Full and Fair Evaluation. The manager over the supervisory or managerial position
develops a performance plan on initial appointment to the supervisory or managerial position.
Hold performance discussions during the probationary period to monitor the progress of the new
supervisor or manager.
4.6. Length of Probation . The maximum length of the probation is 1 year. New supervisors
and managers normally serve the entire period.
   4.6.1. The DCPDS produces a notice 90 calendar days before the end of the probation to
   remind the CPF and supervisor of the certification due date.
 16                                                                  AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999


   4.6.2. The supervisor, with agreement from the next higher level manager, may terminate
   probation when it becomes clear the employee lacks the aptitude or skills for the position and
   further training and experience will not provide the skills for full and effective performance.
   4.6.3. As an exception to the rule, based on consistently demonstrated acceptable
   performance for at least 6 months, the supervisor may certify that probation was satisfactorily
   completed. The supervisor certifies this in writing, signs and forwards it to the CPF.
4.7. Failing to Complete Probation. Managers and supervisors may not continue in the
position if they do not satisfactorily complete probation.
   4.7.1. When the employee cannot complete probation satisfactorily, the employee returns to
   a nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial position.
   4.7.2. Return an employee to a nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial position for failing to
   complete probation only for reasons that relate directly to the employee's performance as a
   supervisor or manager. This return is not an adverse action. Process actions to demote or
   separate for conduct or performance unrelated to supervisory or managerial performance
   under 5 CFR Part 432 or 752.
   4.7.3. Give an employee who returns to a nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial position
   sufficient facts to make clear why you took such action.
      4.7.3.1. Give written notice of the reasons for the action to the employee.
      4.7.3.2. Include with the notice information on how the Air Force will satisfy the
      employee's placement rights.
   4.7.4. Continue to consider an employee whom you returned to a nonsupervisory or
   nonmanagerial position for assignment to other supervisory or managerial positions.
   Because position requirements and individual abilities vary, an employee who is unsuited to
   one supervisory or managerial position may perform satisfactorily in another.
   4.7.5. An employee who returns to a lower graded nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial position
   may not retain the grade or pay of the higher position.
      4.7.5.1. If the employee already has an entitlement to grade or pay retention from a prior
      position, it is unaffected by this assignment.
      4.7.5.2. If the employee's entitlement to grade retention ceased on promotion to a
      supervisory position, the employee may resume the remainder of the period of eligibility
      if the employee does not complete probation and returns to the previous or equivalent
      position.
   4.7.6. An employee who received a promotion from a nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial
   position to a supervisory or managerial one may return under this instruction to a position of
   no lower grade and pay than the one left.
      4.7.6.1. An employee who transfers from a nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial position at
      a different agency to a supervisory or managerial position in the Air Force and does not
      satisfactorily complete probation has the right to be assigned in the Air Force rather than
      at the originating agency.
AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999                                                                        17


      4.7.6.2. If the employee fails probation under this chapter, do not use RIF procedures to
      determine the new assignment.
      4.7.6.3. Do not use a temporary appointment to give a "fall-back" job to the supervisor or
      manager who fails probation. Don't obligate the Air Force except in connection with
      overseas employment with return rights.
   4.7.7. When it is appropriate for an employee to return to a nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial
   position, the employee’s organization will place the employee. If the employee in question is
   to be moved from or to a career program position, the CPF must coordinate the placement
   with the career program.
   4.7.8. An employee who is serving a supervisory or managerial probation overseas and was
   assigned to that position from a nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial position with return rights,
   may need to exercise those rights to regain the nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial position.
4.8. Crediting Service Toward Completing the Probationary Period.
   4.8.1. Moving to Other Supervisory or Managerial Positions During Probation. A supervisor
   or manager who is assigned or promoted to another supervisory or managerial position
   during probation must serve probation for the new position. Service in the former position
   counts toward completing the probation for the new position.
      4.8.1.1. When an employee serving probation is temporarily placed in another
      supervisory or managerial position (for example, under detail, or temporary promotion),
      the employee receives credit toward completing the probationary period for the
      temporary service.
   4.8.2. Temporarily Moving to a Nonsupervisory Position During Probation. Temporarily
   moving to a nonsupervisory position during probation (for example, detail, temporary
   promotion, or reassignment) does not give credit toward completing probation.
   4.8.3. Getting Credit Toward A Subsequent Probationary Period. When an employee
   serving probation under this chapter moves to a permanent nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial
   position, a nonpay status, or has a break in service of over three calendar days, the employee
   does not receive credit toward completing a probationary period under a subsequent
   appointment. EXCEPTION: Employees receive full credit for absence on or off the rolls for
   compensable injury, illness, or military duty.
      4.8.3.1. When the Air Force separates an employee for cause or returns the employee to
      a nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial position during probation, the service does not count
      toward completing probation under subsequent appointment or assignment.
   4.8.4. Temporary Service Before Probation. Serving as a supervisor or manager under
   temporary appointment counts toward completing probation if the temporary period was
   more than 120 calendar days or occurred immediately (without a break in service) before
   changing to a permanent supervisory or managerial position.
   4.8.5. VRA Service Prior to Probation. Serving as a supervisor or manager under a VRA
   appointment counts toward the employee's conversion to a supervisory position in the
   competitive service. If the Air Force moves an individual serving on a VRA appointment to
18                                                               AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999


  a supervisory position during the 2-year period and the employee does not have enough time
  under the VRA to satisfy the supervisory probation, the individual serves the remaining
  probation time after conversion.
AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999                                                                         19


                                           Chapter 5

                     DEALING WITH PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS

5.1. Identifying Performance Problems. To maintain a high-quality civilian work force and
encourage employees to strive for top performance, supervisors should act as soon as they notice
a performance problem. The supervisor can't always know the source of the problem. Health
problems, injury, disease, psychiatric problems, alcohol abuse, or other disabling conditions
might exist. Nor will the supervisor necessarily know if the medical condition is the cause of the
problem. Supervisors must identify, address, and correct problems early.
5.2. When Medical Condition Impairs Performance. If the supervisor suspects that the
employee's performance is adversely affected by alcohol or drug abuse, or by some other
medical condition, apply the provisions of AFI 36-810, Substance Abuse Prevention and
Control. Medical condition means health impairment which results from injury or disease,
including psychiatric conditions.
   5.2.1. Do not remove an employee through adverse action for ineffective performance unless
   these requirements are met.
   5.2.2. When a medically-based performance problem exists or might exist, the supervisor:
       5.2.2.1. Informs the employee that job performance is suffering.
       5.2.2.2. Advises the employee to supply medical documentation of any medical
       condition that could be affecting work performance.
       5.2.2.3. Explains exactly what documentation the employee needs (5 CFR 339.104) and
       the amount of time (opportunity period, see paragraph 5.4.) employee has to provide it.
   5.2.3. The employee supplies pertinent documentation as soon as possible after being
   informed of unacceptable performance on the job. If the employee does not provide the
   documentation within the specified time, the supervisor may grant more time or proceed with
   the action.
   5.2.4. If the employee provides medical documentation and has 5 years of creditable service
   under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or 18 months of creditable service under
   the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), the CPF furnishes information about
   disability retirement and explains that applying for disability retirement will not preclude or
   delay any other appropriate personnel action.
   5.2.5. The supervisor and an Air Force or other federal medical officer review the medical
   documents that the employee provides. These criteria apply:
       5.2.5.1. When the employee's job requires meeting physical or medical standards or is
       covered by the environmental health or bioenvironmental engineering programs, the
       supervisor may require the employee to report for a medical examination.
       5.2.5.2. In any case, a management official may require or offer a psychiatric
       examination according to 5 CFR 339.301(e)(1)(i) and (ii). Coordinate any such action in
       advance with the CPF.
 20                                                                  AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999


       5.2.5.3. When the supervisor requires or suggests a medical examination, the employee
       must receive a written explanation and be informed of the consequence of refusing.
   5.2.6. All medical examinations must comply with Title 5 CFR Part 339. The Air Force
   pays for or provides the medical examination.
5.3. When Disabled Employee Has Performance Problem. When dealing with a disabled
employee's performance problem, both the supervisor and the CPF must discharge any
obligations per 29 CFR 1614.203.
5.4. Initiating the Opportunity Period:
   5.4.1. If the employee's performance becomes unacceptable in one or more critical
   element(s) at any time during the appraisal cycle, the supervisor must inform the employee in
   writing:
       5.4.1.1. The critical element(s) of the performance plan for which the employee’s
       performance is unacceptable.
       5.4.1.2. How performance is unacceptable.
       5.4.1.3. What the employee must do to remain in the position.
   5.4.2. Air Force recommends that the supervisor complete a performance appraisal, if
   possible. (Table 2.1.)
   5.4.3. The supervisor initiates an opportunity period to give the employee a reasonable time
   to demonstrate acceptable performance. The time period should align with the level of the
   employee's duties and responsibilities, usually 30-60 days.
   5.4.4. If the supervisor issues the employee's appraisal, the employee has the right to ask a
   higher level supervisor (if any) to reconsider the appraisal. The reconsideration process must
   comply with the negotiated grievance procedures or agency grievance procedures.
   5.4.5. The supervisor must help the employee improve performance during the opportunity
   period. Help may include closer supervision and counseling, personal demonstration,
   supervisory or peer coaching, frequent reporting, special assignments, and on-the-job
   training. Although this instruction does not require it, the supervisor may order formal
   training for the employee.
   5.4.6. At the end of the opportunity period, if the employee's performance does not improve
   to an acceptable level, the supervisor may propose a reduction-in-grade or removal.
   5.4.7. If the employee's performance improves to an acceptable level after receiving an
   unacceptable rating, the supervisor:
       5.4.7.1. Completes a new rating (appraisal rating type O, unless the rating is the annual
       appraisal).
       5.4.7.2. Obtains the reviewing official's and employee's signature.
       5.4.7.3. Sends the rating to the CPF for input to DCPDS.
AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999                                                                         21


   5.4.8. If an employee performs acceptably for one year from the beginning date of the
   opportunity period, and the employee's performance subsequently becomes unacceptable, the
   supervisor initiates a new opportunity period before proposing a reduction in grade or
   removal.
5.5. Reassigning, Demoting, or Removing Employee For Performing Unacceptably. These
rules do not apply to demoting or removing an employee serving a probationary period (see
Chapter 3), or demoting a supervisor or manager serving probation (see Chapter 4). Sample
memos      are    at    the   Air     Force   Personnel    Center     WWW        site  at:
http://www.afpc.randolph.af.mil/permiss .
   5.5.1. When an employee's performance does not improve despite all attempts to correct it,
   use 5
U.S.C. 4303 and 5 CFR Part 432 to remove the employee.
   5.5.2. When a supervisor demotes or removes an employee:
      5.5.2.1. Coordinate with the CPF before issuing the notice.
      5.5.2.2. Notify the employee in writing 30 calendar days in advance of the proposed
      action.
      5.5.2.3. Identify specific instances of unacceptable performance justifying the proposed
      action.
      5.5.2.4. Specify the elements in each instance of unacceptable performance. (NOTE:
      The instances of unacceptable performance must have occurred during the opportunity
      period and within the previous 1-year period ending on the date of the proposed notice.)
      5.5.2.5. Give the employee reasonable time to answer orally or in writing to the
      supervisor or other management official. The employee may retain an attorney or other
      representative.
   5.5.3. The notice period expires at the end of the 30 days unless the supervisor extends it for
   an additional 30 days. See 5 CFR 432.105 (a)(4)(i)(B) for reasons allowing you to extend the
   notice period beyond 30 calendar days.
   5.5.4. If the employee provides medical documentation during the notice period, consider it
   part of the reply to the notice. The employee must provide the documentation within the set
   time limit, if possible. Also, consider any documentation you receive after the time limit, but
   before making final decision.
   5.5.5. The management official who makes the final decision considers only the
   unacceptable performance specified in the proposed action notice and any replies, including
   medical documentation.
   5.5.6. Make the final decision within 30 calendar days after the notice period expires.
   5.5.7. The supervisor who decides to go ahead and demote or remove the employee must
   specify or reference the unacceptable performance justifying the action.
   5.5.8. A higher level management official than the person proposing the action must concur
   with the final decision, normally the second-level supervisor.
22                                                                   AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999


  5.5.9. The notice of decision must tell the employee of appeal rights and whether eligible for
  disability or discontinued service retirement.
  5.5.10. Deliver the written notice of decision to the employee on or before its effective date.
  5.5.11. An employee who is demoted or reassigned due to unacceptable performance retains
  the unacceptable rating. The employee need not serve another opportunity period on entering
  the new position. After serving 90 calendar days in the new position, the employee receives a
  new rating, which then goes to the CPF for input to DCPDS.
  5.5.12. If the employee's performance improves to an acceptable level during the notice
  period and continues to be acceptable for 1 year from the date of the advance notice specified
  in paragraph 5.5.2., above, the Air Force removes any records of less than acceptable
  performance from the employee's records.
  5.5.13. After demoting or removing an employee for unacceptable performance, keep all
  pertinent documents according to AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule. All
  documents must be available for review by the employee or representative. The file must
  include:
     5.5.13.1. Copy of the notice of proposed action
     5.5.13.2. Employee's written reply
     5.5.13.3. Summary of any oral reply
     5.5.13.4. Notice of decision and the reasons
     5.5.13.5. Any supporting material including documentation regarding the employee's
     opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance
     5.5.13.6. A statement that the OPM approved system and the program on which it is
     based is on file in HQ USAF/DPFM, if the employee appeals the action
AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999                                                                       23


                                          Chapter 6

                          WITHIN-GRADE INCREASES (WGI)

6.1. General. This chapter applies to FWS and GS employees except those GS employees on a
temporary appointment of one year or less. An employee automatically receives a WGI who:
   6.1.1. Completes the required waiting period.
   6.1.2. Did not receive an equivalent pay increase during the period.
   6.1.3. Demonstrates overall acceptable performance.
6.2. Waiving Requirements For Determining Acceptable Performance:
   6.2.1. A GS employee who completes the waiting period but is in a duty status for fewer
   than 60 calendar days during the final 52 calendar weeks of the waiting period due to
   absences considered creditable service, such as paid leave or service credit under the back
   pay provisions of 5 CFR Part 550, receives a WGI without demonstrating acceptable
   performance.
   6.2.2. An FWS employee in a duty status for fewer than 30 calendar days during the 26-
   calendar weeks waiting period receives a WGI per paragraph 6.2.1.
6.3. Granting WGI:
   6.3.1. Employees meeting service requirements automatically receive the WGI when their
   last assigned rating was Acceptable. If performance declines to unacceptable on any critical
   element(s), see instructions below on withholding the WGI.
   6.3.2. To grant a WGI any time following denial or when an employee's performance
   improves from unacceptable to acceptable, complete the appraisal form (indicating an
   Acceptable rating) and submit it to the CPF no later than 14 calendar days before the WGI
   due date.
   6.3.3. When an employee transfers to an Air Force activity, the AFPC/CPF tries to obtain
   ratings from the losing activity/agency. If those ratings do not arrive in sufficient time to
   ensure the timely receipt of a WGI, the CPF may contact the gaining supervisor to obtain and
   input an Acceptable rating to ensure that the WGI will not be delayed if deserved.
6.4. Postponing WGI. Postpone giving the WGI to a GS or FWS employee when either
condition in paragraphs 6.4.1. and 6.4.2. exists.
   6.4.1. The employee's performance is unacceptable and you have not given the employee a
   performance plan or explained the specific requirements for acceptable performance at least
   30 calendar days before the end of the waiting period. Notify the CPF that you intend to
   postpone granting a WGI.
   6.4.2. The employee was reassigned or demoted due to unacceptable performance and is
   eligible within 60 calendar days for a WGI. The CPF notifies the supervisor of the increase
   due date and the requirement to postpone.
   6.4.3. Under either condition, the supervisor must notify the employee in writing that:

       6.4.3.1. WGI is being postponed
       6.4.3.2. Reason for postponement
       6.4.3.3. The employee has no more than 90 calendar days to demonstrate acceptable
       performance
   6.4.4. Give the employee a new or revised performance plan setting the performance
   elements and standards to be met during the 90-day period.
   6.4.5. When the employee attains acceptable performance any time after the 60th calendar
   day, but not later than the 90th calendar day, complete the rating of record form and send it to
   the CPF. The employee receives the WGI retroactive to the original date due.
   6.4.6. If the employee's performance remains unacceptable after the 90th calendar day, the
   supervisor must withhold the WGI. Complete the appraisal form; send it to the CPF; and
   comply with paragraph 6.5..
6.5. Withholding WGI. Withhold WGI when: The employee's rating of record is Acceptable,
but actual performance has deteriorated to unacceptable; the employee's rating of record is
Unacceptable; and when the employee fails to demonstrate acceptable performance during the
90-day postponement period.
   6.5.1. When an employee's performance deteriorates to unacceptable, the supervisor must:
       6.5.1.1. Complete the appraisal form to notify the CPF of the decision to issue a new
       rating and deny WGI.
       6.5.1.2. Give a copy of the rating to the employee.
       6.5.1.3. After coordination with the CPF, give the employee a letter explaining the
       decision to deny WGI no later than 30 calendar days before WGI due date (sample at
       Figure 6.1.).
   6.5.2. A letter of decision to withhold a WGI must contain:
       6.5.2.1. The specific performance element and standard that the employee is not
       fulfilling.
       6.5.2.2. An explanation of how the employee must improve performance to receive a
       WGI.
       6.5.2.3. A statement of the employee's right to representation.

       6.5.2.5. The name and address of the official to whom the employee may send a
       reconsideration request.
       6.5.2.6. Information advising the employee:
          6.5.2.6.1. To file any reconsideration request in writing and state why the decision

          representative also wants to reply orally to the decision.
AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999                                                                         25

      file containing all pertinent documents.
      6.5.2.8. The file's location, how to review the file, and the name, office symbol, location,
      and telephone number of the person with whom to make review arrangements.
      6.5.2.9. A statement granting the employee and the employee's representative a
      reasonable amount of time to review the material and prepare a response. NOTE: A
      standard definition of "reasonable" is impossible. You must base the amount of time you
      give for each case on the particulars of that situation, such as the amount of and type of
      material involved and the difficulty in obtaining assistance. If the employee is covered by
      a bargaining agreement, you must follow the provisions of the agreement.
      6.5.2.10. A statement that the employee may request a time extension if sufficient reason
      exists.
6.6. Employee Representation Rights in Reconsidering WGI Denial. For bargaining unit
employees, provisions of the bargaining agreement govern the employee's rights to
representation. Employees not in a bargaining unit may be accompanied, represented, and
advised by a representative of their own choice.
   6.6.1. The reconsideration official may disallow the employee's choice of representative if:
      6.6.1.1. The representative's activities pose a conflict of interest or position.
      6.6.1.2. Releasing an employee from an official position to serve as representative would
      be too costly to the government.
      6.6.1.3. The proposed representative's priority work assignments preclude serving as a
      representative.
   6.6.2. If appropriate, formally disallow a representative in writing and deliver the notice to
   the employee or the employee's representative, if the employee is unavailable.
      6.6.2.1. Justify the disallowance citing regulatory provisions and other authorities.
      6.6.2.2. The notice of disallowance explains management's position in an adjudication.
   6.6.3. An employee in a bargaining unit may challenge the decision to disallow a
   representative through the provisions of the bargaining agreement or 5 U.S.C. 7118.
   6.6.4. An employee who is not in a bargaining unit may challenge the disallowance of the
   representative according to Air Force instructions.
6.7. Reconsidering Withholding WGI:
   6.7.1. If the employee makes an oral response, prepare a transcript or summary. Give the
   employee or representative an opportunity to submit a written exception to the summary or
   transcript. Any exception becomes part of the reconsideration file.
   6.7.2. Reconsideration review includes:
      6.7.2.1. The employee's response
      6.7.2.2. The performance plan
      6.7.2.3. The rating of record
 26                                                                 AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999

       6.7.2.5. Other documentary evidence
       6.7.2.6. The overall rating that was the basis for withholding the WGI 6.7.3. The
       reconsideration official must notify the employee in writing of the decision within 30
       calendar days of receiving the employee's reconsideration request.
       6.7.3. The reconsideration official must notify the employee in writing of the decision
       within 30 calendar days of receiving the employee's reconsideration request.
   6.7.4. The rating and reviewing officials may revise or prepare a new rating of record form
   that documents an overall acceptable rating. If the rating is acceptable, the employee
   receives the WGI retroactively to the original due date.
6.8. When Withholding WGI Remains In Effect:
   6.8.1. Inform the employee in writing of the reasons for the decision and explain the
   employee's appeal rights to the Merit System Protection Board (5 CFR 531.410(d)).
   6.8.2. For an employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement, a reconsideration
   decision that sustains a negative determination is only reviewable in accordance with the
   terms of the agreement.
6.9. Action After WGI Is Withheld. After withholding the WGI, the supervisor may grant the
WGI when the employee demonstrates sustained acceptable performance.
   6.9.1. The supervisor will review the performance for an acceptable level of competence
   determination every 90-180 days and again no more than 1 year after the original WGI
   eligibility date. The supervisor who denies a WGI must make annual decisions on the
   employee's performance level.
   6.9.2. If the employee's performance improves to an acceptable level after having WGI
   withheld, the supervisor completes the appraisal form, and sends it to the CPF. The
   employee then receives WGI the first day of the first pay period after the acceptable
   determination has been made.
   6.9.3. If the employee's performance does not improve to an acceptable level after remedial
   action and within a reasonable period of time after originally withholding WGI, the
   supervisor works with the CPF to determine other corrective or administrative action.
6.10. Reconsideration File. When the employee receives a final negative decision, the CPF
puts together an employee reconsideration file. The file must contain only documents that were
available to the employee including:
   6.10.1. Written negative decision.
   6.10.2. Copy of the rating of record.
   6.10.3. Documentation of the performance discussions that served as the advance notice of
   deficient performance.
   6.10.4. Employee's written request for reconsideration.
   6.10.5. Report of any investigation.
   6.10.6. Written summary or transcript of any oral presentation by the employee.

Figure 6.1. Sample Letter of Decision to Withhold Within-Grade Increase.
FROM: Organization/Functional Address Symbol (of employee's supervisor)

SUBJECT: Decision to Withhold Within-Grade Increase (WGI)

TO: (Employee's name and organizational address)

1. This is to notify you that I am withholding your WGI, which is (was) due on ___(date)___.
During your last progress review, held on ___(date)___, I advised you that you have been
performing your duties and responsibilities unacceptably and that you would have to improve
your performance by the end of the required waiting period on ___(date)___ to advance to the
next higher step of your grade. Below are the performance elements and standards for
acceptable performance in which you were deficient. (List each deficiency by element, standard,
and reasons the performance does not meet the standard.)

2. On ___(date)___, I assigned you a rating of record. A copy of your rating is attached. Your
performance was still unacceptable, as indicated above. Because your performance is not
acceptable, the Air Force will withhold your WGI.

3. To be granted your WGI, your performance, for each element listed in paragraph 1, must
meet the established standards. (If the standard does not state specifically what is expected, the
supervisor must state here exactly what the employee must do to improve to an acceptable level).
Your performance must also continue to meet the standard(s) established for all other elements
of your performance plan. I will continue to counsel you in improving your performance.

4. (State here the employee's right to representation in preparing a response to the negative
determination.) If you elect to have a representative, your request for reconsideration must so
state and contain the name of that individual.

5. You or your personal representative may request an administrative reconsideration of this
decision. Put your request in writing and make sure that (name, office location, and telephone
number of reconsideration official) receives it no later than 15 calendar days from the date you
receive this notice. Your request must state the specific reasons you believe the Air Force should
reconsider the decision to withhold your WGI. Alternatively, if you or your personal
representative wish to present the reasons for requesting reconsideration orally to (name of
reconsideration official), indicate this in your written request and ask for an appointment to make
this presentation. We will consider extending the time limit if you can show sufficient reasons
for needing an extension. You and your representative, if otherwise in a duty status, may have
up to ______ hours of official time to prepare your request for reconsideration. Submit your
request for use of official time to me. If you have a representative who is a military member or

AF Form 860A, Civilian Rating of Record
AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999                                                                         29



                                           Chapter 7

   USING FACTOR RATINGS ON THE CIVILIAN PROMOTION APPRAISAL FOR
          COMPETITIVE PROMOTION AND INSERVICE PLACEMENT

7.1. Competitive Promotion and Inservice Placement. 5 CFR Part 335, Promotion and
Internal Placement, establishes overall requirements that agency merit promotion programs must
meet. Section
335.103 requires that due weight be given to performance appraisals. An Acceptable rating
enables an employee to compete for promotion or other competitive inservice placement actions.
7.2. When the Civilian Promotion Appraisal is Used. The appraisal may be used for
competitive inservice placement actions including promotions; reassignments to positions with
known growth potential or to positions which provide new knowledges, skills, or abilities
(KSAs) which enhance future career growth; selection for training that would result in
enhancement of career growth; demotion to lower-graded positions that have career growth
above the employee’s current position; and other instances that may be determined in accordance
with AFMAN 36-203, Chapters 2 and 8. The ratings on AF Form 860A, Part F may serve as a
sort factor in determining rank order of those employees having substantively equal KSAs, if
there are more candidates than can be referred to the selecting supervisor. The civilian promotion
appraisal scores are applied using scores derived from algorithms to determine rank order.
7.3. Appraisal of Work Behavior. When a new employee enters the Air Force work force, the
employee is automatically assigned a rating of ―5 - Fully Successful‖ in the DCPDS on the nine
appraisal factors on the Civilian Promotion Appraisal, AF Form 860A, Part F.
   7.3.1. At any time after the employee has performed in the position for a minimum of 90
   days, the rating and reviewing officials may complete the Civilian Promotion Appraisal if the
   officials determine that the employee’s manner of performance warrants ratings other than ―5
   - Fully Successful‖. A change in the appraisal factors under these circumstances may only
   occur once before the end of the current appraisal period.
   7.3.2. Annual ratings on promotion appraisal factors are required at the end of the appraisal
   period.
   7.3.3. Appraisals cannot be rendered on an employee more often than once an appraisal
   period. However, this requirement may be waived at local discretion to satisfy a settlement
   agreement or third-party decision.
7.4. Security and Control Requirements. To maintain the merit system principle of fair and
equal job competition, certain material used in competitive inservice placement cannot be given
to unauthorized persons. This precludes compromise of the competitive selection process, and
prevents unfair advantage to some competing candidates. Accordingly, the algorithms assigned
to the nine appraisal factors will not be released to the public, Air Force or other government
employees, commanders, managers, supervisors, or union officials.
   7.4.1. HQ AFPC/DPK, 555 E Street West Suite 1, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4530, will
   maintain the algorithms in a secure fashion.
30                                                              AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999


  7.4.2. Qualified parties, as authorized by HQ USAF/DPF, may have access to and use of the
  algorithms for research validation purposes.
AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999                                                                          31


                                           Chapter 8

                                          RECORDS

8.1. Supervisor’s Records. Supervisors use the AF Form 860, Civilian Performance Plan or
the core personnel document (CPD) to record performance elements, set performance standards,
and document employee acknowledgment of the element(s) and standard(s). The supervisor
keeps the original of the AF Form 860 or CPD with the AF Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee
Brief, or in the EPF (paragraph 8.2., below), maintained along with the AF Form 971 in the
supervisor’s employee work folder. The supervisor gives a copy to the employee, and if the EPF
is maintained at the CPF, sends a copy there. At the end of the appraisal period, the supervisor:
   8.1.1. Completes AF Form 860A, Civilian Rating of Record and sends the original to the
   CPF, or keeps it in the EPF maintained along with the AF Form 971 in the supervisor’s
   employee work folder and gives a copy to the employee.
   8.1.2. If the original goes to the CPF, keeps a copy for the EPF and gives a copy to the
   employee following the requirements of any applicable bargaining agreement.
8.2. Employee Performance File (EPF). The EPF contains the AF Form 860 or CPD with
performance element(s) and standard(s), and AF Forms 860A maintained IAW paragraph 8.3.
below. The EPF may be:
   8.2.1. A separate file maintained along with the AF Form 971 in the supervisor’s employee
   work folder, or
   8.2.2. A separate file maintained with the OPF, or
   8.2.3. An envelope located on the left side of the OPF.
NOTE: No fewer than three months before each CPF is scheduled to be serviced through the Air
Force Personnel Center, the contents of the EPF should be transferred to each supervisor for
maintenance in the supervisor’s employee work folder.
8.3. Keeping Records. Maintain AF Forms 860, 1003, and 860A for four years (5 CFR
293.404).
   8.3.1. Destroy performance appraisals and DCPDS records superseded through an
   administrative, negotiated, quasi-judicial or judicial proceeding as soon as possible after
   receiving the final decision.
   8.3.2. Keep any performance documents connected with the proceedings in a separate file as
   long as necessary.
   8.3.3. Destroy performance appraisals and DCPDS records reflecting unacceptable
   performance when a notice of proposed demotion or removal was issued but not effected,
   within 30 calendar days after the employee completes one year of acceptable performance.
8.4. Transferring Records. When an employee moves within the Air Force or to a new agency
any time during the appraisal period:
   8.4.1. Transfer all performance ratings of record retained in the EPF, i.e., performance
   ratings that are four years old or less, including the performance plan on which the last rating
   was based (5 CFR 293.405(a)).
 32                                                                  AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999


   8.4.2. See Table 2.2. to determine whether the rating of record is completed or an
   informational rating is sent to the gaining supervisor.
   8.4.3. When an employee transfers from another agency to the Air Force, the AFPC/CPF
   tries to obtain ratings of record from the losing agency. Initially, DCPDS automatically
   generates a presumptive acceptable rating. When the AFPC/CPF gets current ratings from the
   losing agency, those ratings are recorded and the current rating replaces the presumptive
   acceptable rating.
       8.4.3.1. Other agency appraisal systems may not use appraisal factors for merit
       promotion. In this case, ensure that the Air Force appraisal factors used for competition
       in merit promotion are appropriately completed.
8.5. Disposal of Records. When the OPF of a non-SES employee is sent to another Air Force
activity, federal agency or the National Personnel Records Center, the losing AFPC/CPF
includes in the OPF the contents of the EPF, i.e., performance ratings that are four years old or
less, including the performance plan on which the last rating was based (5 CFR 293.405)(a)), as
well as any rating prepared according to Table 2.2. or Table 2.3..

6. Initial temporary appointment must be for more than 1 year. Employees who receive
temporary appointments for 1 year or less and who are subsequently extended beyond 1 year are
not eligible for within-grade increases.
7. Unless appointment is limited (for example, not to exceed one year).
8. Appropriate personnel may recommend and approve WGI or QSI, but these may not become
effective until maximum salary limit increases.

                  PERFORMANCE EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

A3.1. Purpose and Background. Specific provisions of law, regulation, and Department of
Defense (DoD) policy require certain matters be considered in the performance evaluations of
some employees. Except as provided below, this does not require the establishment of specific
performance elements and standards addressing the individual’s performance. Rating officials
may just consider these requirements in the performance rating or provide narrative evaluations
of progress in meeting these requirements (e.g., in a statement on the appraisal form).
A3.2. DoD Performance Evaluation Requirements.
   A3.2.1. Audit Follow-Up. Performance evaluations of appropriate managers must reflect the
   degree of effectiveness in addressing audit findings and recommendations and implementing
   agreed upon corrective actions as required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
   Circular A-50, ―Audit Follow-up,‖ 29 September 1982. This requirement applies to audits
   conducted by the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Inspector General, Department
   of Defense (IG, DoD). This requirement is established in paragraph E.2.g of DoD Directive
   7650.3, ―Follow-Up on General Accounting Office, DoD Inspector General, Internal Audit,
   and Internal Review Reports,‖ 5 September 1989.
   A3.2.2. Personnel Security Program. Performance evaluations of employees assigned to
   sensitive duties (or other duties requiring a trustworthiness determination) must on a
   continuing basis also have an evaluation of their security eligibility. This requirement is
   established in paragraph 9-102(d) of DoD 5200.2-R, ―Personnel Security Program,‖ January
   1987.
   A3.2.3. Internal Management Control. Performance evaluations of management who have
   significant Internal Management Control (IMC) responsibilities must reflect the
   accountability for the success or failure of IMC practices. This requirement is established in
   paragraph E.3.d of DoD Directive 5101.39, ―Internal Management Control Program,‖ 14
   April 1987.
   A3.2.4. Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO). Performance evaluations of supervisors,
   managers, and other personnel with EEO responsibility shall have a critical element on EEO.
   This requirement is established in paragraph E.2.f of DoD Directive 1440.1, ―The DoD Equal
   Employment Opportunity (EEO) Program,‖ 21 May 1987.
   A3.2.5. Inventory Management. Performance evaluation of individuals employed at
   Inventory Control Points shall give appropriate consideration to efforts made by these
   individuals to eliminate wasteful practices and achieve cost savings in the acquisition and
   management of inventory items. This requirement is established in title 10, section 2458.
   A3.2.6. Acquisitions. Persons serving in an acquisition position in the same acquisition
   career field shall be provided an opportunity for inclusion of any comments on the
   performance of a person serving in an acquisition position. It should be routine practice to
   seek input from program managers when evaluating contracting personnel. This requirement
   is established in paragraph D.19 of DoD Directive 5000.52, ―Defense Acquisition Education,
   Training, and Career Development Program,‖ 25 October 1991.
40                                                                  AFI36-1001 1 JULY 1999


  A3.2.7. Regulatory Reinvention. Performance measurements of persons who are frontline
  regulators, i.e., those who have the authority to order a corrective action or levy a fine on a
  business or other government entry, must focus on results, not process and punishment.
  Therefore, such measures should not be based on process (e.g., number of visits to a business
  or government entity) or punishment (e.g., number of violations found, number of fines
  levied on a business or other government entity). This requirement is established by a
  Presidential Memorandum for heads of federal departments and agencies, ―Regulatory
  Reinvention Initiative,‖ 4 March 1995.
  A3.2.8. Classified Information Management. The performance ratings of civilian employees
  who are original classification authorities, security managers or security specialists, or
  significantly involved in the creation or handling of classified information must include the
  management of classified information as a critical element or item to be evaluated. This
  requirement is established in section 5.6(c)(7) of Executive Order 12958, ―Classified
  National Security Information,‖ 17 April 1995.
  A3.2.9. Safety. Responsible DoD officials, at each management level, including first-line
  supervisors, shall, to the extent of their authority, comply with the Department of Defense
  Occupational Safety and Health Program guidance and regulations. Performance evaluations
  of these employees shall reflect personal accountability in this respect, consistent with the
  duties of the position, with appropriate recognition of superior performance, and conversely,
  with corrective administrative action, as appropriate, for deficient performance. This
  requirement is established in Enclosure 2 to DoD Instruction 6055.1, ―DoD Occupational
  Safety and Health Program,‖ 26 October 1982.
