SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This incorporates
the lessons learned after eight months of ground station utilization. Systems were added and
deleted to more accurately reflect installed configurations. Mission system requirements were
also refined through more descriptive notes.
1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the
ground work for reporting the status of ground station availability. They list the minimum
essential systems and subsystems that must be operational on a ground station for it to perform
specifically assigned unit training, contingency, wartime, training, test or other missions.
 2                                          AFI21-103_ACCSUP_ADD_EE 16 AUGUST 2011


Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness Status of Resources and Training System
(SORTS) reporting only and denotes Mission Capable (MC) ground station capable of being
configured for a contingency mission IAW Commander Air Combat Command (COMACC)
OMNIBUS Plan.
     1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define ground station exceptions and help explain complex
     degraded mission systems such as suspension equipment.
     1.2. Ground Station status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy
     Fully Mission Capable (FMC) ground station, recognizing status actually achieved may be
     less than FMC. A Not Mission Capable (NMC) ground station may be deployed provided it
     is safe for flight and can be configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
     1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
     Command (MAJCOM) differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to
     another MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and
     specify the unit's requirements and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
     1.4. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by Work Unit
     Code (WUC) against the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List
     (BSL) across the page. Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement
     determines applicability of BSL columns. The ground station MESLs incorporate all ACC
     assigned ground station; therefore, it is important to compare only those columns listed in the
     MESL that are applicable to the unit's assigned ground station. For example, units with CC
     (wartime) coded ground station would determine and report status using only the FSL and
     BSL columns related to their DOC statement. Units with TF (training) coded ground station
     would determine and report status using only the FSL and TNG columns. Units with
     multiple coded ground station will ensure status is reported using the MESL columns
     appropriate to the individual ground station assignment code.
