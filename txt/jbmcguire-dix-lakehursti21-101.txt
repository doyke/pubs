This instruction establishes responsibilities, procedures, and operating instructions for recovery
of crash damaged or disabled aircraft involving host, tenant, or transient aircraft in the Joint Base
McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JB MDL) area of responsibility. It will be utilized in conjunction with
other agency policies and all applicable Technical Orders (TO). It applies to all JB MDL
organizations and personnel that maintain aircraft, aircraft systems, equipment, support
equipment, and components regardless of AFSC.

Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained In Accordance With (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS)
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s through local
publications/forms managers.

1. Responsibilities and Procedures.
   1.1. Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst will return to operational status as soon as practical
   after a mishap.
   1.2. In the event of an aircraft crash, maintenance group personnel will respond when
   directed. Many other agencies must be involved to secure the area, provide necessary
   medical attention, and to catalog, photograph, and investigate the causes and effects of the
2                         JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTI21-101 23 SEPTEMBER 2013


    incidents under the JB MDL IEM Plan 10-2, JB MDL Installation Emergency Management
    Plan, AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, or any other pertinent regulations. This
    process may last several days. The Incident Commander (IC) may solicit advice from the
    maintenance response team on how to proceed with a recovery effort. During this period,
    maintenance’s only role is to provide individuals to serve as aircraft experts to locate and
    identify certain aircraft components, and to assist in determining the possible causes and
    effects of the crash.
    1.3. The following events will occur upon declaration of a pending or actual major aircraft
    accident in close proximity to the runway:
       1.3.1. All accident response agencies will be notified IAW the JB MDL IEM Plan 10-2.
       1.3.2. 305 MXG/CC will implement impoundment procedures, as required, for all
       affected aircraft and equipment IAW AFI 21-101_AMCSUP_I, MAF Aircraft and
       Equipment Maintenance Management and local checklists.
       1.3.3. Maintenance Operation Center (MOC) will:
           1.3.3.1. Initiate required notifications IAW 305 MXG Quick Response Checklist
           (QRC) 02, Aircraft Crash.
           1.3.3.2. Designate one aircraft maintenance radio net as the primary maintenance
           recovery operation net and direct only personnel directly involved in the recovery
           operation to switch to the designated recovery operation net.
       1.3.4. Once alerted of a recovery operation, 305 MXS Crash Recovery/Aero Repair
       Shop’s (MXMTA) Shift Supervisor will immediately assemble a recovery team and
       designate a Crash Recovery Team Chief.
           1.3.4.1. The Team Chief will be the focal contact for all CDDAR operations and will
           make direct contact with the Emergency Operations Center (EOC). Upon notification
           of recovery operation, all movement within the recovery area will be coordinated
           through the IC to ensure a safe recovery of aircraft and safety to personnel.
           1.3.4.2. CDDAR team members will report directly to the Crash Recovery Team
           Chief. If necessary, a second team and Team Chief will be identified to sustain
           extended operations.
       1.3.5. The IC and EOC will develop a recovery plan. The 305 AMW CDDAR
       representatives will normally be utilized for USAF and transient aircraft. After initial
       evaluation, the CDDAR Team Chief will coordinate with the EOC and provide any
       assistance they may require.
       1.3.6. Recovery operations will proceed under the detailed instructions of AFI 10-2501,
       Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operation and JB MDL
       IEM Plan 10-2 to ensure all functions work as a cohesive team utilizing detailed plans for
       maintenance activities, crash recovery and/or emergency aircraft removal procedures,
       specific aircraft technical data, and any other appropriate checklists.
       1.3.7. The 87th Civil Engineering Squadron will:
           1.3.7.1. Provide emergency crash/fire response, as well as hazardous materials and
           spill containment capability beyond the scope of the unit spill teams.
