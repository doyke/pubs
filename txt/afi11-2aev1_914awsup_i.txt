2. MAJCOM/A3T, NGB/A3O or HQ AFRC/A3T are waiver authorities, as appropriate,
for the secondary method of training with coordination with AMC/A3TM.

3. For formal training waiver requests, units will submit requests through above MAJCOM
channels. MAJCOMs will in turn submit requests to 19 AF/DO for approval.
1.7. In-Unit Training Time Limitations. Crewmembers entered into in-unit training (initial
qualification, requalification, instructor, etc.) will complete final training events within time
limitations listed in Table 1.2. Final training events are listed in A2.2.7. Crewmembers entered
in an in-unit training program will be dedicated to that program on a full-time basis. In-unit
qualification training will begin no later than 45 days (90 days AFRC/ANG) following
successful completion of formal school requirements (FN/AET course and SERE) and reporting
or attaching to a new duty station or unit. When conducting in-unit qualification training, the
commander will relieve students of duties not directly related to training.
   1.7.1. Units will notify the appropriate MAJCOM/A3T (AMC AD use AMC/A3T CoP)
   before the crewmember exceeds upgrade training time limits extension in Table 1.2
       1.7.1.1. Use the waiver request format specified in Figure 1.1, if electronic waiver
       program is     not available (AMC/AFRC). ANG use waiver format in Figure 1.1 (See
       1.5.9.2) Include training difficulty, unit corrective action to resolve and prevent
       recurrence, and estimated completion date.
       1.7.1.2. Sq/CC may extend training time up to 60-days. Extensions exceeding 60-days
       require MAJCOM/A3T approval.
   1.7.2. Training Time Start Date:
       1.7.2.1. In-unit qualification training begins when the first significant training event (a
       training event directly contributing to qualification, requalification or upgrade) has begun
       e.g. GT-1. Units will define local policy in the unit supplement to this AFI. This initiates
       in-unit training time limitations in Table 1.2.
       1.7.2.1. (914AW) Training Time Start Date. In-unit qualification begins when the first
       significant training events occurs (ie. GT-1). The member will sign a contract stating they
       understand the requirement for up-grade qualification. Up-grades will begin within 90
       days of completing FN/AET course and SERE.

qualification and requalification IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1, this instruction and a MAJCOM
approved standardized qualification syllabus. AECMs should receive their flight evaluation on
their unit assigned MDS.
   2.4.1. Operational Training Mission (OTM), Aeromedical Readiness Mission (ARM), Static
   Training Mission (STM) or any combination thereof can be utilized for upgrade or to fulfill
   flight training requirements. EXCEPTION: F900 will not be credited on STMs. Note: No
   more than half of the flight training periods (FTP) can be accomplished on STMs.
   2.4.2. Initial Flight Training Level (FTL) and Training Event Credit.
       2.4.2.1. Initial and requalification training students will be placed in FTL E until they
       successfully complete their initial or requalification flight evaluation. At that time they
       become FTL D to gain MR Status.
       2.4.2.2. Unit SARM will use Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 to track ground and flying training
       events during Mission Qualification Training (MQT). Mission specific events (M221-
       M345) accomplished during MQT will be required a minimum of one time during
       qualification training. The events accomplished can be tracked on the AECMs ITS. This
       also can be used as a tool for the Flight Instructor (FI).
       2.4.2.3. AECMs in qualification training will complete an AE MAR for documentation
       of the events mentioned above. The current AE MAR can be found on the A3TM AE
       CoP at: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=AM-OP-00-10
       2.4.2.4. Those flight events accomplished on a satisfactory INIT/QUAL/MSN or RQ
       QUAL/MSN evaluation may be credited towards the AECMs continuation training
       requirements for FTL D and establish subsequent due dates for those events.
       2.4.2.5. Logging of flying time. Refer to AFI 11-401.
2.5. Requalification Training (RQT). AFI 11-202, specifies RQ training limits and
requirements. An aircrew member is unqualified upon expiration of QUAL evaluation or loss of
mission currency (F900) exceeding 6 months.
   2.5.1. RQT requires Sq/CC directed training and flight evaluation. RQT students will
   complete Table 2.1 events. Sq/CC directed training will be documented in the AF Form
   4022.
   2.5.2. Unqualified less than 8 years: In-unit RQT training can be accomplished following the
   standardized training syllabus (use MAJCOM approved in-unit plan of instruction until
   release of standardized syllabus). In-unit RQT will apply until the AE FTU is established.
   2.5.3. Unqualified over 8 years. Complete the appropriate ETCA 36-2223 formal initial
   qualification course as described on ETCA website: https://ETCA.randolph.af.mil. Not
   applicable to AECMs until a FTU is operational.
   2.5.4. Basic and instructor requalification training can be conducted simultaneously on a
   case-by-case basis. Initiate a waiver request (see paragraph 1.5) and include proposed
   training events to regain instructor status. When used, the unit will compare requalification
AFI11-2AEV1_914AWSUP_I 26 OCTOBER 2011                                                      23


   syllabus and instructor syllabus and provide a recommendation of training events in the
   request to include an instructor evaluation.
2.6. Senior Officer Qualification and Performance Requirements. AE commanders who are
FNs and not filling a mobility position have the option to maintain MR status but must maintain
BAQ requirements IAW 11-202 Volume 1.

1. Units will determine frequency in local supplement.

2. Individuals will complete this event within 180 days of initial or
   requalification or a mission requiring this event.
3. Mission-ready crewmembers transferring between flying units require this
   event.

4. May be accomplished on the ground or in-flight (Dual credit LL05 and P280)
3.2. Time Periods for Initial Qualification/Requalification. Refer to Table 1.2
3.3. Ground Training Requirements. AECMs that have completed initial and requalification
requirements will complete the events in Table 3.1 to become MR.
   3.3.1. Ground Training events accomplished during initial qualification establish due dates
   for subsequent continuation training. Completion of SERE Training will establish due dates
   (based on date first completing course) for recurring SS02, SS03 and SS05.
3.4. Flying Training Requirements. This section defines the minimum criteria when
participating in an aerial event associated with AE Training.
AFI11-2AEV1_914AWSUP_I 26 OCTOBER 2011                                                        25


  3.4.1. Flight training requirements from Table 4.3 can be accomplished on training
  missions, operational missions (IAW paragraph 1.6.2) or static aircraft training missions
  (STM). Reference AMC/A3T ARM Training guide on the A3TM AE CoP located at:
  https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=AM-OP-00-10              under pre-
  mission requirements for appropriate contents of a mission folder required for training.
  EXCEPTION: F900 cannot be credited on a STM.
     3.4.1.1. During operational missions AECMs in a crew position or augmenting for
     patient acuity (per CN only), are authorized credit toward a Mission Management
     Currency Sortie (F900) provided a minimum of four phases of flight are completed.
     Refer to AFI 11-401 for guidance on logging time.
  3.4.2. Operational Training Mission (OTM) A scheduled operational mission leg on which
  no patients have been manifested for airlift. AECMs may utilize up to 4 hours to complete
  continuation training requirements from Table 4.3.
     3.4.2.1. A basic crew complement of two FNs and three AETs is required.
     3.4.2.2. A MCC is also required for an OTM to facilitate the execution of scenarios,
     provide instructional guidance on medical interventions, aircraft emergencies and
     document observations of crewmember performance.            EXCEPTION:        Prior to
     conducting training on an operational mission, one AECM will assume a patient role and
     one MCC trained AECM will assume the MCC role; thereby decreasing the crew
     compliment for training to one FN and two AETs. One additional simulated litter patient
     will be required to complete the training.      Note: If a MCC trained AECM is not
     available, training is not authorized.
  3.4.3. Aeromedical Readiness Mission (ARM). Aeromedical readiness missions are
  designed to provide training in in-flight medical care and application of medical equipment
  to simulated patients to prepare AECMs for the movement of casualties.
     3.4.3.1. An ARM will not be scheduled for less than two hours of actual flight time to
     provide for quality training. If maintenance or weather precludes the completion of
     training, credit may be granted for the training events accomplished.
     3.4.3.2. An ARM scheduled to fly 4 hours or more should be divided into multiple
     segments of at least two hours to maximize use of flying hours to complete continuation
     training events for all AECMs participating in the mission.
     3.4.3.3. ARM missions will only be conducted on C-17, C-130, and KC-135 airframes.
  3.4.4. Static Training Mission (STM). STM may be accomplished in a static aircraft,
  Fuselage Trainer (FuT) or Cargo Compartment Trainer (CCT) to complete continuation
  training events when a flight has been cancelled or the aircraft is unavailable for flight.
     3.4.4.1. A static training mission should be scheduled for no less than two hours to
     accomplish continuation training events found in Table 4.3.
  3.4.5. Aircrew Ratio (ACR) and Aircrew Composition. On a scheduled OTM, ARM, or
  STM, a basic crew complement of two FNs and three AETs is required. A MCC is also
  required for any mission where training is performed, to facilitate the execution of scenarios,
  provide instructional guidance on medical interventions, aircraft emergencies and document
  observations of crewmember performance.
 26                                        AFI11-2AEV1_914AWSUP_I 26 OCTOBER 2011


       3.4.5.1. ARM Training Exception. Within 24 hours prior to conducting training on a
       scheduled ARM, if less than the basic crew compliment and MCC are available, the basic
       crew complement may be modified by the DO to avoid mission cancellation. Minimum
       crew compliment is one FN and two AETs with a trained MCC. Simulated patients will
       be mannequins. This exception is based on last minute changes to an ARM scheduled
       with a basic crew complement and MCC. If a MCC trained AECM is not available or the
       minimum crew compliment cannot be filled, the ARM will be cancelled. The AE Unit
       Scheduler or designated representative will notify the OG/CC or designated
       representative of the exception to crew complement. Notify MAJCOM of the exception
       within 48 hours post mission. Document crew changes in remarks section of AFTO 781,
       ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
       3.4.5.2. Contingency Exercise Training Mission (CETM). A training mission conducted
       during a Wing/MAJCOM/A3D sponsored exercise (e.g. JRTC, AECOT, RODEO or IG
       Inspections). Crew compliment will be IAW AFI 11-2AE, Volume 3 and based on
       scenario requirements. All crewmembers will be current and qualified. Upgrade
       training/evaluations are prohibited on CETM flights. A trained MCC is not required for
       the mission. AECMs may also take credit for specific events identified Table 4.3. A
       CETM mission has no required flight time.
   3.4.6. AE Equipment. An AE crew scheduled to fly an ARM or STM are required to carry
   operational AE In-Flight Kits and PMI Equipment, this includes a ventilator. NOTE: For an
   ARM, controlled medications are optional at the discretion of the Sq/CC.
   3.4.7. AE Mission Training. The minimum training standard for an ARM, OTM or STM will
   include one enplaning or one deplaning session with occupied or weighted litters (may be
   manikin or live simulated patients), coupled with training scenarios that meet the objective of
   at least one simulated aircraft emergency, and at least one simulated medical emergency. At
   least two litter patients will be simulated for mission requirements. Consult AMC/A3T
   Aeromedical Readiness Mission (ARM) Training Guide for additional guidance.
   3.4.8. Tandem Training Missions (TTM). AECMs on an Aeromedical Readiness Mission
   (ARM) are authorized to conduct simultaneous (tandem) training on the same aircraft
   utilizing no more than two basic AE crews to meet flight currency requirements. AECMs in
   primary crew positions will log primary time when performing in-flight duties. Example:
   Two basic AE crews conducting separate in-flight training using separate in-flight kits,
   medical equipment, mission documentation and led by (2) separate MCCs. Training of
   tandem crews will be noted on AFTO 781. A lead crew will be identified to the flight crew
   prior to take off for CRM purposes. (Ref AFI 11-401)
3.5. Unit Assigned MDS Training Requirements. Conversion training is normally associated
with a unit conversion to another MDS. Unit conversions to the universal qualification aircraft
listed in Chapter 2 require LL01, LL03 and LL05 prior to first flight.
   3.5.1. Units must receive MAJCOM/A3 (or equivalent) approval prior to unit-assigned MDS
   change. After final approval, publish a unit letter to identify initial cadre of instructor and
   flight instructors by crew position.
AFI11-2AEV1_914AWSUP_I 26 OCTOBER 2011                                                      27


3.6. Minimum C-21 Training Requirements. AECM’s that require C-21 qualification will, at
a minimum, complete the following MDS specific training listed below. Further training
requirements will be defined in the unit supplement.
   3.6.1. LL03D C-21 Ground Egress

5. The AFRC quarterly CRM is logged in ARMS with the following schedule: 4-events per year,
   Semi-Annual currency.

6. Mandatory for FNs only.

7. Do not complete CBT for unit assigned airframe. Refresher CBTs/IBT will be utilized for
   recurring events if available. Initial students will complete the non-refresher CBTs.

8. If applicable to the mission and if required for deployment

9. Mandatory for AETs only. See 4NOX1 CFETP/AFTR for requirement.

10. LL03 for unit assigned MDS Ground Egress (AECM) event.

11. LL06 should be accomplished in conjunction with SS02, LL03, or SS05. See Chapter 7.
4.2. Aircrew Status. AE crewmembers are assigned to MR, NMR or BAQ status.
   4.2.1. Mission Ready (MR). For Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS),
   operational tasking, and deployments, a MR crewmember is defined as one who is available,
   current and qualified (completed qualification/mission training for the applicable crew
   position).
   4.2.2. Non-Mission Ready (NMR). A crewmember that is unqualified, non-current or
   incomplete in required continuation training. See paragraph 4.8.1 for specific guidance on
   crewmembers who are non-current or incomplete in required continuation training.
       4.2.2.1. If a crewmember is NMR for failure to complete any required continuation
       training, the Sq/CC will place the crewmember in supervised status and have the AECM
       complete training as soon as possible or request a waiver from the OG/CC for required
       training events IAW Table 4.1 in accordance with paragraph 1.5.2.1 If a waiver is granted
       the AECM remains on MR status. AECMs failing to complete non-waivered NMR
       events will be placed in supervised status.
       4.2.2.2. AECMs NMR for failure to maintain continuation flying requirements (Table
       4.3) will be placed in supervised status for the deficient training events. The individual
       must fly with an instructor of like specialty until required training is accomplished. The
       crewmember cannot deploy until the required training is completed.
       4.2.2.3. Failure to complete ground continuation training requirements (Table 4.1.)
       prohibits an individual from flying outside of the CONUS or accomplishing unsupervised
       in-flight duties until the required training is completed or waived IAW Table 4.1, Note 8.
 30                                        AFI11-2AEV1_914AWSUP_I 26 OCTOBER 2011


      The crewmember cannot deploy OCONUS until all continuation training is completed.
      OCONUS MAJCOMs may allow individuals to fly local, routine, and non-contingency
      mission in their respective theater as specified in MAJCOM supplement.
   4.2.3. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). Does not apply to AE personnel.
   4.2.4. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). A crewmember that has satisfactorily completed
   initial or requalification training in any universal designated MDS and is qualified to perform
   aircrew duties.
   4.2.5. MR and BAQ crewmembers must accomplish and/or maintain the requirements in
   AFI 11-202 Volume 1 (for their respective status) and the appropriate events in the ground
   and semi-annual flying continuation tables in this chapter.
4.3. Training Levels.
   4.3.1. The Sq/CC assigns crewmember training levels (TL) see paragraph 1.4.6.2. Each
   AECM will be assigned one FTL and one GTL based on the guidance below.
      4.3.1.1. NMR crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM Headquarters, Tanker Airlift Control
      Center (TACC), Numbered Air Force (NAF), USAF Expeditionary Center (USAFEC),
      Contingency Response Group (CRG), Air Mobility Operations Group (AMOG) and
      USAFSAM are categorized as FTL E and GTL 4.
   4.3.2. Flying Training Levels (FTL).
      4.3.2.1. FTL ―A‖– Highly Experienced Crewmembers. This may include MR HQ AF,
      MAJCOM, TACC and NAF (AFRC) personnel; formal schoolhouse instructors; AMWC
      instructors; wing, operations group, and squadron commanders; operations officers,
      personnel assigned to OG examiner positions; and any instructors assigned primarily to
      staff duties. Sq/CC’s have the discretion to assign highly experienced MR unit
      crewmembers to this level.
      4.3.2.2. FTL ―B‖– Experienced, MR Crewmember.
      4.3.2.3. FTL ―C‖– MR Crewmember.
      4.3.2.4. FTL ―D‖– BAQ Crewmember. Primarily for individuals pursuing MR status
      after initial qualification training.
      4.3.2.5. FTL ―E‖— BAQ non-instructor staff in initial or requalification training. May
      include senior officers, MAJCOM, NAF, AMOS and TACC staff who are not
      maintaining MR or instructor status. FTL E requirements are insufficient for MR status,
      and crewmembers assigned to this FTL will fly with an instructor of like specialty at all
      times. Initial and Requalification students will be assigned FTL E.
   4.3.3. Ground Training Levels (GTL).
      4.3.3.1. GTL ―1‖ - Highly experienced crewmembers with 10 or more years as a
      qualified AECM.
      4.3.3.2. GTL ―2‖ - Experienced crewmembers with between 5 and 10 years as a
      qualified AECM.
AFI11-2AEV1_914AWSUP_I 26 OCTOBER 2011                                                       31


      4.3.3.3. GTL ―3‖ – Inexperienced crewmembers with less than 5 years as a qualified
      AECM.
      4.3.3.4. GTL ―4‖ - NMR senior officers and staff officers, and crewmembers who are not
      required to maintain MR status. This may also include students in initial or
      requalification training.
   4.3.4. Changes of FTL or GTL.
      4.3.4.1. During in-unit initial and requalification training students are categorized in
      ARMS as FTL E (fly with like specialty at all times) until successful completion of their
      flight evaluation. After completion of their flight evaluation they will be categorized as
      FTL C if all requirements for MR status (Table 3.1) have been met.
      4.3.4.2. Upon successful completion of a formal course qualification program (FTU) the
      BAQ AECM will be categorized as FTL D until MR training requirements (Table 3.1)
      are completed.
      4.3.4.3. Once the semi-annual period begins, do not move a MR crewmember to a level
      requiring fewer events except upon completion of instructor upgrade. Prorate events at
      the end of the training periods.
4.4. Training Events/Tables. Standardized ARMS training event identifiers and descriptions
are in Chapter 7. Designate Unit Defined Events (UDE) as ―X‖ event (i.e. X020).
   4.4.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment. Credit required events accomplished on an ARM,
   OTM and STM missions. Those flight events accomplished on a satisfactory
   qualification/mission or requalification evaluation may be credited towards the individual’s
   currency requirements and establishes a subsequent due date.
   4.4.2. For an unsatisfactory flight evaluation, do not credit continuation training
   requirements for those events graded Q-3 until requalified.
   4.4.3. Crewmembers performing extended alert duty (more than 72-hours) may accomplish
   ground training that does not degrade required response time or mission accomplishment.
   Specify requirements and/or restriction in MAJCOM supplement.
4.5. Continuation Training Requirements.
   4.5.1. Ground Training Events. Crewmembers will comply with requirements of Table 4.1
   See Chapter 7 for event descriptions.
      4.5.1.1. Crewmembers attached to units (i.e. MAJCOM, NAF (AFRC), AMWC, etc.)
      may accomplish ground training events at locations other than their unit of attachment.
      The crewmember is responsible for reporting accomplished training events to their unit of
      attachment (ARMS office).
      4.5.1.2. All training events will be recorded in ARMS. Input all one-time events and
      events required for Permanent Change-of-Station (PCS) in the ARMS database.
      4.5.1.3. Aircraft Training (CBT/IBT) – will be completed for continuation per Table 4.1
      CBT/IBTs will be completed on a 17 month cycle to refresh aircraft specific training.
      AECMs may choose to align completion of the CBT/IBTs in preparation for their open-
      book test requisite.

NOTES: Key: A – Annual, D – due in listed number of days; T-Triennial-Training accomplished
once every 3-years. B-Biennial-Training accomplished once every 2-years, 1– accomplished once
every semi-annual period; 2 – accomplish twice every semi-annual period. Event requirements are
defined in Chapter 7.

   1. Must be accomplished by any primary crewmember (to include FI and FE) or MCC. MCC
      can credit events twice in a semi-annual period.
   2. Requirement cannot be waived at local level. See Para. 4.7.1.1.
   3. 90 day requirement for ARC.
   4. Cannot be credited on a STM
   5. May be accomplished by any AECM who is actively involved in the training scenario
      (including the Simulated Patient if current in F900).
   6. Event can be credited for applicable exercises, (i.e. JRTC, AECOT, IG Inspection, CETM
      flight) or while deployed to a flying assignment.
   7. May be accomplished on the ground or in-flight. Dual credit with LL05.
    4.6. Ancillary Training. Ancillary Training is guidance or instruction that contributes to
    mission accomplishment, but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series. In
    accordance with AFI 11-202 Vol 1, AMC no longer controls the frequency for ancillary training
    events. Information for these events can be found at: https://etca.randolph.af.mil.
    4.7. Proration of Training. AFI 11-202 Volume 1 describes proration of training requirements
    for crewmembers not available for flying duties. In addition, prorate training for non-availability
    due to contingency alerts and contingency flying TDYs when the contingency precludes training
    for certain mission events. This authority must be used judiciously, especially when prorating
    the same crewmember for consecutive semi-annual training periods.
       4.7.1. Use this formula to determine training requirements: (e.g., FTL C AET in need of
       M221 was available 136 days. Take 5 (months available per Table 4.4) X 2 (events in semi-
       annual period) divided by 6 (months in semi-annual period) = 1.6. Round down to nearest
       whole number, but not less than 1. Prorated requirement for M221= 1).
           4.7.1.1. Use Table 4.4 to determine the number of months available. Prorate only if
           absence is at least 15 consecutive days.
           4.7.1.2. When an individual permanently changes station to a unit flying the same model
           aircraft and enters the same training level or lower, during the training cycle, credit
           training accomplished at the previous base. Prorate training requirements based on the
           time available (e.g. time at former base, plus time at new base, minus number of days not
           available) during the training period. Time available starts 7 days after sign-in for
           CONUS and 14 days after sign-in for OCONUS or on the date of actual accomplishment
           of the first training event, whichever occurs first. Subtract previous accomplishments
           from the prorated total to determine remaining requirements.
       4.7.2. Units may also prorate requirements for individuals changing training levels. Units
       may elect to credit past accomplishments, but if they elect to do so they may not prorate new
       training requirements. Individuals moving from Level A to Level B must complete any new
       training currencies required in Level B. Individuals moving from Level C to Level A or B
       must re-qualify in the events they are not qualified in and complete mission qualification
       requirements.
AFI11-2AEV1_914AWSUP_I 26 OCTOBER 2011                                                         35

4.8. Failure to Complete Training Requirements. Declare individuals NMR if they fail to
complete ground (Table 4.1) or semiannual flying continuation training requirements (Table
4.3). The following guidance applies:
   4.8.1. Failure to Complete Semi-Annual Flying Training Events. At the end of the semi-
   annual training period, the Sq/CC will review ARMS products for crewmembers that fail to
   accomplish all required flying continuation training events. Sq/CC will direct training
   necessary for the individual to regain MR status or request an OG/CC waiver for the
   requirement (paragraph 1.5.2.1).
         4.8.1.1. Place individuals delinquent in one or more events in supervised training status
         and declare them NMR until the flying event is completed or waived. Loss of MR status
         prohibits an individual from accomplishing unsupervised in-flight duties. (For example:
         An AECM is delinquent in aircraft emergencies must fly in a primary crew position with
         an instructor of like specialty to complete these events).
         4.8.1.2. Failure to complete Mobility Training events in Table 4.2 does not affect MR
         status but restricts crewmembers from performing missions that require the delinquent
         event(s) until the training is accomplished.
         4.8.1.3. With the exception of mandatory grounding events in Table 4.1 the OG/CC may
         waive ground continuation training events identified in the table notes. This waiver
         authority will be used judiciously. The decision to grant a waiver will be on a case by
         case basis, based on the individual crewmember’s experience and proficiency level.
         OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the waiver. The make-up period
         should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity. This waiver is for unforeseen
         circumstances only and only for events that will not degrade mission accomplishment.
   4.8.2. Re-Currency Training.
         4.8.2.1. Loss of Currency. Flight currency is associated with the event denoted in the
         flying continuation training table by a specific period of time (60 or 90 day). Place
         individuals delinquent in Mission Management Currency Sortie (F900) in supervised
         status for that event and declare them NMR. Crewmembers non-current for less than
         6-months will maintain their current flight training level (no training folder
         required). Crewmembers are non-current the day after event currency expires (i.e., a
 36                                        AFI11-2AEV1_914AWSUP_I 26 OCTOBER 2011


      crewmember with a 60-day requirement accomplished F900 on 1 September, becomes
      non-current on the 61st day, 1 November).
      4.8.2.2. For loss of currency up to 6-months, a crewmember must demonstrate
      proficiency on any aircraft they are qualified on. They must be in a designated crew
      position with an instructor of like specialty for all delinquent items.
      4.8.2.3. Regain currency for Mission Management Currency Sortie (F900) as follows:
          4.8.2.3.1. Non-current AECMs will fly with an instructor in a primary crew position.
          As a minimum, the AECM will demonstrate/verbalize aircraft emergency
          equipment/exits and review the In-flight Medical Kit and emergency functions of the
          medical equipment with the Instructor. If an AECM does not meet the minimum
          requirements to regain currency the instructor will recommend training and a repeat
          currency flight. Opening a training folder is not required.
          4.8.2.3.2. Following completion of the applicable requirements, the instructor will
          document and sign on the file copy of the Flight Authorization and the AFTO 781 the
          following: ―Rank, name of AECM, has completed requirements to regain currency on
          this mission.‖ IAW AFI 11-401.
          4.8.2.3.3. Regain currency based on the time elapsed since becoming non-current as
          described in paragraph 4.8.2.3 MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) is the waiver authority
          for all OG/CC endorsed flight currency waiver requests (paragraph 1.5.2). NOTE:
          Non-current AECMs may regain currency on a periodic flight evaluation.
   4.8.3. Loss of currency exceeding 6-months. The crewmember is unqualified in the aircraft
   and must complete requalification training (paragraph 2.5) and receive an aircrew evaluation
   according to AFI 11-2AE V2.
   4.8.4. See AFI 11-202 Volume 1, for individuals leaving active flying status.
   4.8.5. Training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.
4.9. Requirements Before PCS or TDY by Rated Members on Active Flying Status. AFI
11-202 Volume 1 specifies requirements before PCS or TDY.
4.10. Requirements Before Removal From Active Flying. AFI 11-202 Volume 1 specifies
requirements before removal from active flying.
4.11. Requirements While In Inactive Flying Status. AFI 11-202 Volume 1 specifies
requirements while in inactive flying status.
4.12. Requirements for MAJCOM/NAF Stan/Eval or Aircrew Training AECMs. AECMs
assigned to MAJCOM/NAF Stan/Eval or Aircrew Training Directorates will attach to an AE
squadron of choice and maintain mission ready status.
4.13. Aircrew Flying With Other Than US Air Force Units. AFI 11-202 Volume 1 addresses
individuals flying in this status.
4.14. Training Period. Continuation training program is based on 6-month (semi-annual)
periods (1 January – 30 June; 1 July – 31 December).
