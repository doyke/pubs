                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. Scope. This volume establishes procedures for operation of the MQ-1 and MQ-9
   unmanned aircraft systems. It provides guidelines for MQ-1 and MQ-9 operations and
   applies to all aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of the MQ-1 and
   MQ-9. Use this instruction in conjunction with aircraft flight manuals, Department of
   Defense Flight Information Publication (FLIP), and applicable Joint and USAF directives.
   Pilots will comply with Joint Order 7610.4, Special Military Operations, Chapter 12, Section
   9, UAS Operations in the NAS, where applicable.
   1.1.2. Phase Manuals. Training units may develop phase manuals from procedures
   contained in relevant documents. Phase manuals may expand on basic procedures, but they
   will not be less restrictive than flight manuals and applicable USAF instructions. Operational
   units may use phase manuals to augment mission qualification and continuation training.
1.2. Aircrew Responsibilities. In conjunction with other governing directives, this volume
prescribes procedures for MQ-1 and MQ-9 aircraft operations under most circumstances, but it is
not a substitute for sound judgment. Crewmembers may accomplish operations or procedures not
specifically addressed in this volume if they enhance safe and effective mission accomplishment.
   1.2.1. Pilot in Command (PIC). For a crew with more than one qualified pilot, the PIC will
   be identified prior to assumption of aircraft control and has responsibility and authority as
   defined in AFI 11-202V3. The PIC may change during missions as pilots cycle in and out of
   the ground control station (GCS).
   1.2.2. The Pilot/Sensor Operator (PSO) racks allow for the pilot to fly from either the left or
   right seat. For all ground and flight operations, the pilot flying the aircraft will occupy the left
   seat unless equipment malfunctions dictate use of the right seat (EXCEPTION: For a multi-
   aircraft control ground control station (GCS), the right seat is defined as the corresponding
   sensor operator (SO) station in the back of the GCS). During critical phases of flight (see
   Attachment 1, Terms and Definitions), a SO must be in the right seat (EXCEPTION: Unit
   commanders may designate, by name in writing, pilots who are authorized to occupy the
   right seat during critical phases of flight). During non-critical phases of flight above 2,000
   feet above ground level (AGL), the right seat may be unoccupied.
   1.2.3. Sensor Operator (SO). The SO performs target acquisition and maintains custody of
   the target to include recommending optimal sensor selection and, if required, search patterns
   for the specific target. He/she identifies key target features and location to facilitate target
   reacquisition. The SO is also responsible for knowing desired aircraft positions to maximize
   effectiveness of various sensors and for coordinating with other crewmembers to maximize
   mission effectiveness. During weapons employment the SO will maintain custody of and
   laser designate/illuminate the DPI designated by the PIC in accordance with briefed TTPs
   and voice concerns/questions with the attack or weaponeering. Unless directed otherwise by
   the PIC, during all phases of flight, the SO will notify the PIC prior to changing sensors or
   moving the MTS from a locked position. The SO also assists in monitoring aircraft systems
   and operating airspace.

     1.2.4. Crewmembers must have a thorough working knowledge of all procedures included in
     this volume that are applicable to their crew positions.
1.3. Deviations and Waivers.
     1.3.1. Deviations. Deviations from these procedures require specific approval of
     MAJCOM/A3 unless an aircraft emergency or urgent operational necessity dictates
     otherwise. In these cases, the PIC will evaluate all options and take the appropriate action to
     ensure the safe recovery of the aircraft. Deviations must be reported to MAJCOM/A3 as
     soon as practical.
     1.3.2. Waivers. Waiver authority for this instruction is the MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3)
     or COMAFFOR only for forces under their operational control, unless otherwise noted.
1.4. Key Terms and Definitions.
     1.4.1. “Will”, “shall” or “must” indicates a mandatory requirement.
     1.4.2. “Should” is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
     accomplishment.
     1.4.3. “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
1.5. Distribution. Each aircrew member is authorized a copy of this volume.
AFI11-2MQ-1&9V3 1 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                 7


                                           Chapter 2

                            MISSION PLANNING & BRIEFING

2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning/preparation is shared jointly by
the individual aircrew members and the operations and intelligence functions of the organization.
   2.1.1. The PIC is responsible for mission planning and will ensure the crew is briefed prior
   to assuming command of the aircraft. Pilots will ensure the best route, sensors, and altitudes
   are used for target acquisition and threat avoidance.
   2.1.2. Aircrew other than the aircrew flying the mission may accomplish the mission
   planning. Aircrews will not fly unbriefed missions and/or events. If operationally necessary,
   missions may be modified while the aircraft is airborne as long as changes do not
   compromise flight safety. The PIC will ensure all aircrew are aware of and acknowledge any
   changes.
   2.1.3. Complete sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission accomplishment. Areas
   covered will include, at a minimum, weather, emergency mission setup, fuel requirements,
   mission objectives, stores configuration (if applicable), communication procedures, and
   Operational Risk Management (ORM) (include takeoff and landing data, departure and
   arrival procedures, and threat study when applicable).
2.2. Maps, Charts, and Flight Logs.
   2.2.1. Local Area Maps. A local area map of sufficient detail to remain within assigned
   training/operational areas and identify potential emergency landing sites will be available for
   display in the GCS. Ensure that, as a minimum, the PSO racks contain charts/maps that are
   accurate enough to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft.
   2.2.2. Enroute Charts/Approach Procedures. Units will ensure FLIP publications
   applicable to MQ-1 or MQ-9 flight operations are available. These can include enroute
   charts, terminal instrument procedure books, or loading the current electronic FLIP for
   display on monitors in the GCS. The PIC will also review applicable FLIP for the terminal
   areas and along the route of flight during pre-mission planning.
   2.2.3. Mission Maps and Navigation Route Maps. Display the most appropriate
   chart/map during the mission. Charts will be of sufficient scale to provide adequate
   navigation and obstacle/terrain avoidance. The PIC shall consider minimum safe altitude
   (MSA) when determining normal, operational, and emergency mission altitudes.
2.3. Briefing and Debriefing.
   2.3.1. Briefing Guides. Briefing guides can be found in Attachments 2-5. All applicable
   items in the briefing guides will be adequately briefed by the PIC or other members of the
   crew. Units may customize these guides as required for mission accomplishment. Items
   published in unit standards and understood by all participants may be briefed as “standard”.
   2.3.2. Briefing Times. Ensure enough time is allotted so that mission briefings, crew
   briefings, and changeover briefings cover all required items and provide enough time to
   transition between events.

    2.3.3. Mission Brief. The pilot will brief all crewmembers to ensure safe and effective
    mission accomplishment. Briefings will be tailored to accommodate the experience level and
    capabilities of each crewmember participating in the mission.
       2.3.3.1. All crewmembers scheduled to fly the mission will attend a mission briefing.
       Units may cover items from the Mission/Crew Briefing Guide in a mass setting
       conducted by the Operations Supervisor (AFSOC: Mission Director (MD), or Flying
       Operations Supervisor (FOS) as applicable). Crewmembers that did not attend a mission
       briefing will obtain Operations Supervisor / MD / FOS (as applicable) approval prior to
       participating in a flight. The PIC will ensure crewmembers participating in a flight under
       Operations Supervisor, MD, or FOS approval are adequately briefed prior to assuming
       crew duties.
       2.3.3.2. The PIC should brief an alternate mission for each flight if applicable.
    2.3.4. Changeover Briefs. Individual crewmembers will complete a changeover brief
    (Attachment 3) for each crew position changeover. Briefs will not be accomplished
    simultaneously. Crew specific changeover briefs may be done in accordance with squadron
    standards.
       2.3.4.1. The incoming aircrew is responsible for ensuring they are briefed on the mission
       and aircraft status.
       2.3.4.2. The outgoing aircrew is responsible for ensuring the incoming aircrew is aware
       of any write-ups and/or unusual situations encountered during the mission.
       2.3.4.3. Change out one crewmember at a time to ensure continuous monitoring of the
       aircraft. The incoming PIC is the final authority in determining if circumstances are safe
       to replace crews.
    2.3.5. Fuel, Emitters, Navigation, Communication, and Engage (FENCE)
    Check. Crewmembers will complete FENCE checks on all operational missions IAW Air

                          NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Ground Control Station.
   3.1.1. The number of people allowed in the GCS should be the minimum required to meet
   mission requirements and to maintain a sterile cockpit environment. The PIC is the final
   authority on the number of people allowed in the GCS (to include visitors) during operations.
   Only qualified pilots or IP-supervised student pilots may fly the aircraft.
   3.1.2. Unless requested by the PIC, personnel will not enter the GCS when the aircraft is in a
   critical phase of flight. PICs should restrict entry into the GCS only to individuals with
   appropriate system expertise during abnormal operations.
   3.1.3. Aircrew will not place items (checklists, charts, etc.) behind the flap lever, propeller
   control lever (MQ-1) or condition lever (MQ-9), throttle, or speed lever at any time. Aircrew
   will ensure no items interfere with aircraft controls or the Heads-Down Displays (HDD).
   Items may be placed on the shelf above the HDD.
   3.1.4. Unit commanders will ensure all aircrew members participating in missions are
   focused on their in-flight responsibilities and not tasked with other duties while the mission is
   underway.
   3.1.5. Smoking is prohibited within 50 feet of the GCS.
   3.1.6. While in the GCS aircrew members will only operate electronic devices necessary for
   safety of flight or the accomplishment of the mission.
   3.1.7. The PIC will ensure the GCS is properly secured after each mission to include the
   removal/securing of all classified materials.
3.2. Required Equipment. The GCS must have required equipment for flight per AFI 11-202
V3. Additionally, the equipment listed in this paragraph is required for initial takeoff. If the
equipment fails while airborne, the PIC will determine whether to continue the mission.
   3.2.1. Two separate cameras are required for flight. This requirement will include at least
   one nose camera.
   3.2.2. INS/GPS.
       3.2.2.1. MQ-1. Both the inertial navigation system (INS) and global positioning systems
       (GPS) must be operational.
       3.2.2.2. MQ-9. All INS/GPS navigational systems must be operational at takeoff. Should
       an INS/GPS unit fail once airborne, the mission may continue, provided that a minimum
       of two INS/GPS units are fully-functional and that the PIC determines that the loss of one
       INS/GPS unit will not adversely affect mission accomplishment.
   3.2.3. Missions that will include a portion of the flight during periods of night as defined by
   AFI 11-202V3 require at least one approved infrared (IR) video camera.

   flying in controlled airspace.
   3.2.6. Units may include additional equipment requirements for training and operational
   missions in their local procedures supplement (Chapter 8) to this instruction.
3.3. Communications. Aircrew will exercise intercom discipline. Units should tailor intercom
use to mission specifications and unit needs.
   3.3.1. Ground Communication. The pilot will ensure two-way communication is
   established with the ground crew prior to all ground checks and anytime the aircraft's engine
   is operating on the ground. Two-way communication will be maintained until the pilot
   releases the ground crew.
   3.3.2. In-flight Communications.
       3.3.2.1. Limit communications to flight-critical information during critical phases of
       flight.
          3.3.2.1.1. The pilot should announce intentions during critical phases of flight and
          when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures.
          3.3.2.1.2. The sensor operator will notify the pilot immediately upon seeing a
          potential air traffic conflict, airspace deviation or potential terrain or obstruction
          clearance conflict. In addition the SO should notify the pilot upon seeing a 200 foot
          or greater deviation in planned altitude.
       3.3.2.2. Each aircrew member will monitor the crew intercom and aircraft radio to the
       maximum extent possible, and will announce to the crew when not monitoring
       appropriate channels, and when resuming monitoring. In cases where the capability
       exists to connect with the intercom system of a different GCS aircrew will announce their
       presence on intercom in accordance with unit guidance.
       3.3.2.3. Before making any camera changes or MTS manipulation below 2,000 feet
       AGL, each crewmember will announce, and the other crewmember acknowledge, the
       change.
       3.3.2.4. Primary aircrew members will announce the execution of critical action
       procedures (CAP) while accomplishing the action, or notify other crewmembers
       immediately after the fact which CAPs have been accomplished.
       3.3.2.5. Aircrews will minimize telephone use during critical phases of flight.
       3.3.2.6. The pilot will announce, and the sensor operator will acknowledge, all altitudes
       departing from and climbing/descending to on the intercom.
       3.3.2.7. The sensor operator will inform the pilot of all HDD caution and warning
       messages during non-critical phases of flight. Pilots will brief which HDD messages will
       be called out during critical phases of flight.
3.4. Checklists.
AFI11-2MQ-1&9V3 1 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                  11


   3.4.1. Each crewmember will reference applicable checklists during all phases of flight. The
   PIC is responsible for checklist completion. Electronic checklists are authorized for use
   however spare electronic or paper copy checklists must be available to each crewmember
   should failure of the primary checklist source occur.
   3.4.2. Aircrews should make every effort to avoid non-essential tasks when below 2,000 feet
   AGL.
   3.4.3. Unit-developed checklists, such as fanfolds, are authorized. Prior to use, these
   checklists must be approved by the MAJCOM Standardization/Evaluation and the aircraft
   Flight Manual Manager (FMM), and meet requirements established in AFI 11-215, USAF
   Flight Manuals Program (FMP).
3.4.4. Approved checklists contained within AFTTP 3-1.Predator, AFTTP 3-1.MQ-9, AFTTP 3-
3.Predator, and AFTTP 3-3.MQ-9 are authorized for use during weapons deliveries.

3.5. Ground Operations. During ground operations with the aircraft powered, the pilot will
warn the crew chief prior to any action that might cause the aircraft control surfaces to move and
receive verbal acknowledgement that all personnel are clear.
3.6. Engine Start/Taxi.
   3.6.1. Engine Start.
       3.6.1.1. All engine starts require a fireguard.
       3.6.1.2. The engine will only be started on the command of the pilot.
   3.6.2. Taxi Operations.
       3.6.2.1. The pilot and sensor operator will use the best available camera, or combination
       of cameras, to ensure safe taxi operations given the current conditions.
       3.6.2.2. When taxiing in an area requiring a marshaller, aircrew will maintain visual
       contact with the marshaller until established on taxiway centerline and clear of
       obstructions. If visual contact with the marshaller is lost prior to being established on
       taxiway centerline and clear of obstructions, the pilot will stop the aircraft until visual
       contact with the marshaller is regained. Once the all clear signal is given by the
       marshaller, aircrew will taxi at their own discretion.
       3.6.2.3. If the pilot loses sight of the taxiway centerline, the pilot will stop the aircraft
       until visual contact with the centerline is reacquired. If the pilot cannot regain sight of
       the centerline, a marshaller will be used before moving the aircraft any further.
       3.6.2.4. The sensor operator will use the MTS to ensure the aircraft is clear of
       obstructions during taxi operations. The sensor operator will obtain clearance from the
       pilot prior to releasing the MTS from position mode.
       3.6.2.5. If the pilot is only using the MTS to taxi, the aircraft will be brought to a
       complete stop before releasing the MTS from position mode. The MTS will be placed in
       position mode prior to resuming taxi.
       3.6.2.6. Maintain safe taxi speeds at all times, not to exceed 10 knots ground speed
       (KGS) on a taxiway, 20 KGS on a runway, and 5 KGS in a turn.

       3.6.2.7. Minimum taxi interval between MQ-1 and/or MQ-9 aircraft is 150 feet daytime,
       300 feet at night. Pilots will exercise caution and increase following distance when
       taxiing behind heavy or jet powered aircraft.
       3.6.2.8. When RCR is less than 12, minimum taxi interval is 300 feet.
       3.6.2.9. Prior to unpinning/arming, pilots will confirm with the ground crew that hands
       and feet are clear of all aircraft controls and parking brake is set.
       3.6.2.10. Pilots will not taxi in front of aircraft being armed/de-armed with forward firing
       ordnance.
       3.6.2.11. Pilots will not taxi over a raised cable.

   runway, weather, rotation speed, liftoff speed, climb speeds, and emergency procedures.
   3.8.2. For takeoff, the sensor operator will select a different HUD video source and camera
   from the one selected by the pilot.
   3.8.3. On training missions, do not takeoff if the computed takeoff roll exceeds 80% of the
   available runway.
   3.8.4. Crews may takeoff prior to a raised cable provided there is at least 5,000 ft of runway
   or minimum required takeoff distance (whichever is greater) prior to the raised cable.
   3.8.5. The sensor operator will place the MTS in position mode for takeoff. Flight graphics
   will be displayed on both PSO racks until at least 500 ft AGL.
   3.8.6. During departure/arrival, the SO will monitor the flight path and advise the pilot of
   any deviations from ATC clearance.
   3.8.7. Closed Traffic Pattern. Initiate a closed pattern at the departure end of the runway
   (or sooner if permitted by Local Operating Procedures) when cleared by tower. Minimum
   airspeed to initiate a closed pattern is computed climb speed.
3.9. Cruise.
   3.9.1. The pilot will always have flight graphics displayed.
   3.9.2. Operations (Ops) Checks.
       3.9.2.1. The aircrew will perform operations checks at least once per hour. These checks
       will include fuel level, oil level, propeller pitch operation (MQ-1), electrical, datalink,
       engine parameters and emergency mission status at a minimum.
       3.9.2.2. Ops checks are also required:
          3.9.2.2.1. During climb or at level-off after takeoff.
AFI11-2MQ-1&9V3 1 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                13


          3.9.2.2.2. Prior to entering an air-to-surface range, once while on the range if
          multiple passes are made, and after departing the range.
          3.9.2.2.3. Prior to transitioning to any critical phase of flight.
      3.9.2.3. The conduct of ops and oil level checks will not interfere with tactical or safety-
      of-flight operations. If required, aircrew may postpone these checks until such time as
      they may be accomplished without mission degradation.
3.10. Approach and Landing.
   3.10.1. Aircrew will comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria for small aircraft.
   3.10.2. Approach.
      3.10.2.1. The pilot will accomplish an approach brief including, as a minimum,
      approach speed, glide speed, winds, altimeter, type of landing, go around point and
      missed approach procedures (as required). Additional items may be briefed per local
      instructions.
      3.10.2.2. The pilot must have visual reference to the ground prior to descending below
      1,500 feet AGL in the terminal area without a published Airport Surveillance Radar or
      Precision Approach Radar terminal approach procedure at the operating airfield.
      3.10.2.3. Pilots will establish normal glide path by 200 feet AGL. Descent rates greater
      than 1,200 feet per minute (FPM) below 200 feet AGL, greater than 600 FPM (MQ-1) or
      800 FPM (MQ-9) below 50 feet AGL, airspeed more than 5 KIAS below calculated
      approach speed, or a pilot-induced oscillation (PIO)/bounce require a go-around. The
      sensor operator will monitor the approach and announce over intercom any deviations
      exceeding these parameters and will call a go around.
      3.10.2.4. Unless otherwise briefed, the SO will announce altitude deviations exceeding
      +/-100„ at the Initial Approach Fix, Final Approach Fix (FAF), and Minimum Descent
      Altitude, as well as when reaching Decision Height (DH) or the Missed Approach Point
      (MAP).
   3.10.3. Landing.
      3.10.3.1. The pilot will normally accomplish a 3 degree approach.
      3.10.3.2. The recommended touchdown zone for a visual approach is 500-1,500 feet
      from the threshold, or the glide path interception point for a precision approach. Do not
      establish Runway Point of Intercept (RPI) near the threshold unless landing distance is
      critical. When local procedures or unique runway surface conditions require landing
      beyond the recommended point on the runway, adjust the touchdown zone accordingly,
      and brief applicable crewmembers.
      3.10.3.3. Crewmembers will not attempt landing or touch-and-goes over raised webbing-
      type barriers (e.g. MA-1A, 61QS11). Pilots may land or accomplish touch-and-goes
      beyond raised cables provided there is 5,000 feet remaining to the runway end or the next
      raised cable.
      3.10.3.4. For landing, the SO will select a different HUD video source and camera from
      the one selected by the pilot.
 14                                                 AFI11-2MQ-1&9V3 1 NOVEMBER 2012


      3.10.3.5. The MTS will be placed in position mode and flight graphics displayed on both
      PSO racks prior to descending below 500 feet AGL.
      3.10.3.6. The Before Landing checklist should be accomplished prior to departing the
      perch, departing the Final Approach Fix, 3nm final on a straight-in/visual approach, or
      departing Low Key.
      3.10.3.7. If the MTS is the only available video source for landing, the SO will not
      conduct a non-uniformity correction (NUC) of the MTS on final approach without prior
      coordination with the PIC. If the MTS is not suitable for landing below 1,500 feel AGL
      on final approach, and no other video sources are available, the crew must initiate a go
      around.
      3.10.3.8. Pilots will not practice night electro-optical (EO) nose-camera landings. Pilots
      may practice night EO nose camera low approaches.
      3.10.3.9. When the computed landing roll exceeds 80% of the available runway, land at
      an alternate, if possible.
3.11. Fuel Requirements.
   3.11.1. Normal Recovery Fuel. The fuel on initial or at the FAF at the base of intended
   landing or alternate. Establish fuel quantity locally or: 60 pounds (MQ-1) or 400 pounds
   (MQ-9), whichever is higher.
   3.11.2. Minimum Fuel. Pilots will declare minimum fuel to the controlling agency as soon
   as it becomes apparent that an aircraft will enter initial or start an instrument final approach
   at the base of intended landing, or alternate if required, with 50 pounds (MQ-1) or 350
   pounds (MQ-9) of fuel or less.
   3.11.3. Emergency Fuel. Pilots will declare emergency fuel to the controlling agency as
   soon as it becomes apparent that an aircraft will enter initial or start an instrument final
   approach at the base of intended landing, or alternate if required, with 40 pounds (MQ-1) or
   300 pounds (MQ-9) of fuel or less.
3.12. In-Flight Practice of Emergency Procedures.
   3.12.1. Practice of aborted takeoffs and unusual attitude procedures in flight are prohibited.

   3.12.3. Simulated Flame-Out (SFO) Pattern Procedures.
      3.12.3.1. Minimum approach airspeed during an SFO traffic pattern is stall speed plus 10
      KIAS (MQ-1) or 15 KIAS (MQ-9).
      3.12.3.2. Terminate the maneuver if not in a position to land by base key or one mile
      final (straight-in approach). Crews shall make an intracockpit base key/one mile final
      (straight-in approach) call on SFOs stating any deviations from planned parameters and
      establishment of intentions to continue or go around.
      3.12.3.3. Touchdown from an SFO is prohibited. Initiate go-arounds from SFO patterns
      in sufficient time to prevent touchdown.
AFI11-2MQ-1&9V3 1 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                  15


   3.12.4. Because Instructors/Flight Examiners do not have immediate access to a set of
   controls, the pilot at the controls will ensure all in-flight practice of emergency procedures
   are thoroughly briefed, prior to initiation. Instructors/Flight Examiners will direct the crew on
   expected actions (verbalized/simulated or actual procedures) during in-flight practice or
   simulation of emergency procedures.
3.13. Unexpended Ordnance.
   3.13.1. (MQ-9 only) Aircraft returning to base with unexpended free-fall live ordnance will
   fly a straight-in approach to a full stop, unless operational requirements dictate otherwise.
   Pattern work, to include touch and go‟s are authorized with unexpended inert free-fall and
   “pinned” training munitions.
   3.13.2. Aircraft returning with unexpended forward firing live ordnance may accomplish
   pattern work.
3.14. De-Arm Procedures. All aircraft with live or inert ordnance on board will go through de-
arm prior to taxi back. Pilots will confirm all switches are safe and hands are clear and parking
brake set prior to de-arm crew approaching the aircraft.
3.15. Functional Check Flight (FCF). There is no FCF requirement for either the MQ-1 or
MQ-9.
3.16. AF FORM 781, Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. Prior to assuming control of
the aircraft in the GCS, the GCS PIC must be aware of the status of the entire system, both
aircraft and GCS. AFTO Forms 781 will not leave control of the PIC while the aircraft is in
flight.
   3.16.1. LRE PIC. IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management,
   the LRE PIC will review applicable aircraft and Launch/Recovery GCS (LRGCS) AFTO
   Form 781 series forms prior to launch and relay pertinent configuration data to the MCE PIC.
   The LRE PIC will enter any aircraft discrepancies into the aircraft AFTO Forms 781 that are
   relayed by the MCE PIC.
   3.16.2. MCE PIC. IAW AFI 21-101, the MCE PIC will review applicable aircraft AFTO
   Form 781As, and GCS AFTO Form 781 series forms prior to handover from the LRE. MCE
   PIC will annotate all aircraft discrepancies in Skynet / electronic maintenance log or pass to
   the LRE PIC for entry into the aircraft forms if Skynet is not used / available. MCE PIC will
   document GCS discrepancies on GCS AFTO Form 781A.
   3.16.3. MCE to MCE Changeover. MCE PICs will review applicable aircraft AFTO Form
   781As and GCS AFTO Form 781 series forms prior to changeover. During the changeover
   briefing, the outgoing MCE PIC will ensure the incoming MCE crew is briefed on any
   updates to aircraft and GCS status to include discrepancies that have been annotated in
   Skynet or passed to the LRE PIC for entry into the aircraft forms if Skynet is not used /
   available.
3.17. Above Maximum Allowable Gross Weight (MAGW) Operations. Above MAGW
operations require a waiver IAW paragraph 1.3.2
   3.17.1. The following considerations will be evaluated when conducting above-MAGW
   operations:
 16                                                  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V3 1 NOVEMBER 2012


       3.17.1.1. Pilot training, proficiency, and currency.
       3.17.1.2. Environmental conditions.
       3.17.1.3. Hard Landing Inspection Criteria chart from the flight manual. (MQ-9 only)
       Maximum Descent Rate at Touchdown figure in the flight manual. In the absence of
       flight manual data, landings above 10,500 pounds GWT shall not be accomplished.
   3.17.2. (MQ-1 only) Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD). The Aeronautical Systems
   Center (ASC/WII) has generated above MAGW performance data for the flight manual
   based on engineering estimates only. Refer to TO 1Q-1(M)B-1-1 for further information on
   performance data.
   3.17.3. Training. Any waiver for above MAGW operations should include guidelines to
   conduct takeoffs and low approaches to meet training requirements. Landings above flight
   manual maximum allowable landing weight, to include touch and go landings, will not be
   practiced.
   3.17.4. Heavyweight Landing Assessment. The primary risk associated with above
   MAGW operations is the increased probability of airframe damage during landing. If
   circumstances require a landing above maximum flight manual landing weight limitations
   (such as weather, aircraft malfunction, etc.), the crew will immediately notify squadron
   supervision and SOF/FOS. If time permits for safe pilot change out, the most experienced
   pilot in the GCS will conduct the landing.
   3.17.5. Heavyweight Landing Inspection Criteria. Crews will document every landing
   above maximum allowable landing weight in the AFTO Form 781 (include landing weight
   and sink rate). Aircraft with applicable software, and configured with a laser altimeter, are
   exempt from this paragraph's requirements.
3.18. Interfly. Interfly is the exchange and/or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft
between MAJCOMs to accomplish flying missions. Normally, interfly should be limited to
specific operations/tests, exercises, or special circumstances.
   3.18.1. The OG/CC (for AFSOC, OG/CC or COMAFSOF) is the approval authority for
   interfly on aircraft under his or her control. In all cases, interfly aircrew will be qualified in
   the MDS.
3.19. Reduced Lighting Training. Conduct reduced lighting training only in approved
airspace.
3.20. Low Altitude (LOWAT) Operations. The low-altitude environment defined by this
regulation is at or below 5,000 feet AGL/ASL. Aircrew are authorized to fly in low-altitude
environment Day/Night, no lower than 1,000 feet AGL, IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules
and Procedures, restrictions and the following procedures.
   3.20.1. Terrain Clearance Requirements. During all low-altitude flight, the crew will
   ensure the aircraft remains a minimum of 1 NM away from any factor terrain. Factor terrain
   is defined as any terrain within 1,000 feet (at or below) the current aircraft operating altitude.
   When determining the 1 NM standoff requirement, assume the worst case condition of a lost
   link maneuvering aircraft and account for drift caused by winds.
   3.20.2. Mission Preparation.
AFI11-2MQ-1&9V3 1 NOVEMBER 2012                                                              17


     3.20.2.1. Briefing requirements. During briefings, emphasis will be on low-altitude
     flight maneuvering, effects of task saturation, time to ground impact, emergency landing
     sites, terrain features/obstacles along the route of flight, T.O. emergency mission flight
     profile and associated planning considerations, and emergency mission start point
     placement requirements for terrain clearance.
        3.20.2.1.1. Low-Level Abort Procedures. Compute and brief low-level abort
        altitude(s). Compute the abort altitude for the entire route/area using minimum safe
        altitude. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) will provide a clearance of 1,000 feet above
        the highest obstacle/terrain feature (rounded to the next highest 100 feet) within 5
        NM of the planned course, route boundaries, or operating area (e.g. military operating
        area (MOA), low fly area, restricted area, etc.). Operation below MSA is authorized
        day or night as long as the terrain clearance requirements of paragraph 3.20.1 are
        complied with.
            3.20.2.1.1.1. Aircrews shall compute an MSA for each leg/segment of the
            intended route of flight and for separate operating areas.
        3.20.2.1.2. During mission planning, determine areas within the planned operating
        area(s) that provide a minimum of 1 NM clearance from any terrain from 1000 feet
        below the planned minimum operating altitude. These areas will be annotated on the
        low-altitude chart. Increase the 1 NM clearance requirement, based on the turn radius
        of the aircraft going lost-link. Determine limitations, if any, on emergency mission
        start point placement to ensure the 1 NM terrain clearance is met if the aircraft goes
        lost link.
            3.20.2.1.2.1. LOWAT Navigation. When navigating point-to-point in the low-
            altitude environment, the basic 1 NM terrain clearance requirement remains
            unchanged. However, if operating on a point to point pre-planned route, with a
            current and updated emergency mission, a lost link scenario will not result in the
            aircraft deviating from the pre-planned routing. In this case, there is no
            requirement to account for additional terrain standoff due to lost link aircraft
            maneuvering.
            3.20.2.1.2.2. LOWAT Tactical Maneuvering. When tactical maneuvering will be
            required, the 1 NM terrain standoff must account for the possibility of a lost link
            aircraft and the associated maneuvers as well as the effects of winds.
     3.20.2.2. Low-Altitude Maps. On all low-altitude flights, each aircraft will contain a
     minimum of one Chart-Updating Manual (CHUM) updated map of the low-altitude route
     or training areas. The map will be available either digitally or hardcopy during low-
     altitude flight. The map will be of a scale and quality that terrain features, hazards, and
     chart annotations are of sufficient detail to allow navigation and safe mission
     accomplishment.
        3.20.2.2.1. Annotate all maps with an abort altitude and brief the abort altitude prior
        to descending below 5,000 feet AGL.
  3.20.3. General Low-Altitude Procedures.
18                                               AFI11-2MQ-1&9V3 1 NOVEMBER 2012


     3.20.3.1. Weather Minimums. Weather minimums for low-level training will be 3,000
     feet ceiling and 5 miles visibility (as determined by the planned MTS camera source).
     3.20.3.2. If unable to maintain positive visual terrain clearance using the available
     aircraft sensors, immediately climb to, or above, the briefed minimum altitude.
     Transition to a known flight reference to ensure expected aircraft attitude while climbing
     to the abort altitude. Maneuver the aircraft as necessary while climbing to the abort
     altitude to ensure terrain clearance.
     3.20.3.3. Conduct low-level weapons delivery operations IAW AFTTP 3-1 and AFTTP
     3-3.
     3.20.3.4. Minimum flight airspeed during low-altitude flight/navigation is stall +10
     KIAS (MQ-1 or +15 KIAS (MQ-9).
     3.20.3.5. During all low-altitude operations, the immediate reaction to task saturation,
     diverted attention, or an emergency, is to climb.
     3.20.3.6. The pilot will have a readily-available forward-facing camera source (nose
     camera [IR nose camera required for night] or payload position mode) visible at all times
     for terrain clearance reference. The forward-facing camera source may be displayed as
     either the pilots HUD video source or displayed on the auxiliary monitors via
     framegrabber or other video display capability.
     3.20.3.7. The crew will brief and discuss emergency mission management and the
     emergency mission start point prior to descending into the low-altitude environment. The
     emergency mission and emergency mission start point will be continuously updated to
     ensure the aircraft will remain clear of high terrain during any lost-link situation.

                                          Chapter 4

                       INSTRUMENT/WEATHER PROCEDURES

4.1. Approach Category.
   4.1.1. The MQ-1 is an approach category A aircraft.
   4.1.2. The MQ-9 is an approach category B aircraft.
4.2. Weather Minimums, Restrictions, and Planning Factors.
   4.2.1. Ceiling and Visibility.
      4.2.1.1. Operating the aircraft below visual flight rules (VFR) minimums requires a
      published Airport Surveillance Radar or a Precision Approach Radar terminal approach
      procedure at the operating airfield. The MQ-1 INS/GPS and the MQ-9 INS/GPS are not
      certified for flying GPS instrument approaches.
      4.2.1.2. When an alternate airfield is available, aircrews will operate IAW weather
      criteria defined in AFI 11-202V3. When an alternate airfield is not an option or not
      available, aircrews will comply with the following ceiling and visibility restrictions:
          4.2.1.2.1. The worst weather (TEMPO or prevailing) must be at or above a ceiling of
          800 feet or 500 feet above the lowest compatible published landing minima
          (whichever is greater), and a visibility of 2 miles or 1 mile above the lowest
          compatible published landing minima (whichever is greater). The weather must be at
          or above these minima at takeoff and be forecast to be at or above these minima at the
          estimated time of arrival (ETA) plus or minus one hour (±1 hour). In all cases, with
          an operable MTS IR camera, the OG/CC can waive visibility requirements if weather
          is below minimums due to sand/dust only.
          4.2.1.2.2. When the ceiling is below 3,000 feet or the visibility is below 3 miles,
          crewmembers will increase recovery fuel to allow the aircraft to hold for a minimum
          of two hours at best endurance, then penetrate and land with normal recovery fuel.
          This visibility requirement does not apply if the MTS IR camera is operable and
          visibility is below minimums due to sand/dust.
          4.2.1.2.3. While airborne, adjust landing time (early or later) as necessary to ensure
          forecast weather for the ETA (±1 hour) remains within the minima specified in
          paragraph 4.2.1.2.1 If the aircrew is unable to adjust landing time to meet ETA
          buffer requirements, then terminate the mission so as to return the aircraft to the
          operating base with sufficient fuel to hold for a minimum of four hours then penetrate
          and land with normal recovery fuel.
          4.2.1.2.4. While airborne, if the actual weather deteriorates below forecasted and is
          below the minima specified in paragraph 4.2.1.2.1 at the actual time of arrival, pilots
          are authorized to fly to pilot weather category or published approach minimums,
          whichever is higher, if necessary to recover the aircraft.
      4.2.1.3. Unit commanders will ensure that appropriate resources are in place at an
      airfield prior to designating the airfield as an alternate.
 20                                                  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V3 1 NOVEMBER 2012


   4.2.2. Turbulence.
      4.2.2.1. Aircrews will not takeoff if forecast or reported severe turbulence for
      Light/Category I aircraft is present along the route of flight.
      4.2.2.2. CAUTION: Pilots will limit exposure to turbulence to the maximum extent
      practical.
   4.2.3. Wind.
      4.2.3.1. Actual winds must be within flight manual limits at takeoff and landing.
      Forecast winds must be within flight manual limits at ETA (±1 hour).
      4.2.3.2. While airborne, if revised forecast winds for ETA (±1 hour) exceed limits
      specified in the flight manual, the pilot will terminate the mission in time to return to the
      operating base before the forecast time of increased winds, or terminate the mission in
      time to return to the operating base with sufficient fuel to fly low approaches for a
      minimum of two hours (or as directed by Local Operating Procedures) unless a suitable
      alternate is available.
      4.2.3.2.1. If sufficient fuel remains and mission allows, the pilot may establish a new
      ETA to overfly the forecast period of increased winds. The requirements of paragraph
      4.2.3.2 must be complied with for any updated ETA.
      4.2.3.3. Aircrew may use the steady state wind velocity and predominant wind direction
      to assess if winds are forecast within flight manual limits. In the event that worst case
      conditions of gust and/or variability exceed flight manual limits, continue the mission,
      but fuel reserves shall be adjusted to return to the operating base with sufficient fuel to fly
      low approaches for a minimum of two hours (or as directed by Local Operating
      Procedures) and land with normal fuel reserves.
   4.2.4. Emergency Mission/Lost Link Planning. Pilots will maintain awareness of current
   and forecast weather along the planned route of flight, the Lost Link/Emergency Mission
   route of flight, and the intended landing field by all available means. The emergency mission
   route will be updated to account for weather hazards, threats, terrain, and restricted airspace
   along the proposed route of flight. The route will be altered if necessary using care to select
   appropriate aircraft parameters to avoid hazardous weather conditions while complying with
   Air Traffic Control clearances.
4.3. Adverse Weather Operating Procedures.
   4.3.1. Rain, Snow, Freezing Precipitation, and Frost. Pilots will not takeoff with frost,
   ice, or snow accumulation on the wings. Whenever the outside air temperature is less than 40
   degrees Fahrenheit /5 degrees Centigrade, or the pilot is concerned about frost, ice, or snow,
   apply an ice retardant to the wings or inspect the aircraft for frost immediately prior to
   takeoff.
   4.3.2. Precipitation adversely affects aircraft performance and reduces visibility. If
   conditions permit, pilots should minimize exposure to all types of precipitation during all
   phases of flight. If precipitation cannot be avoided, pilots should maximize climb or descent
   rate to exit potential or actual icing conditions.
AFI11-2MQ-1&9V3 1 NOVEMBER 2012                                                               21


  4.3.3. Pilots should not conduct flight into forecast moderate or worse icing and will
  minimize conduct of flight into known icing conditions to the maximum extent possible. If
  encountering icing, pilots should maneuver the aircraft to exit the icing conditions.
  Consideration will be given to turning the EO/IR sensor aft to prevent ice formation on the
  lens face and thus allow use of the sensors to scan flight surfaces and the visual ice detector
  for ice build-up.
  4.3.4. Runway/Taxiway Conditions.
     4.3.4.1. Units will specify minimum runway condition reading (RCR) for taxi
     operations. Do not takeoff or land with an RCR less than 12 (waiver authority is OG/CC).
     When no RCR is available, refer to International Civil Aviation Organization conversions
     in the Flight Information Handbook.
     4.3.4.2. Handling characteristics of the MQ-1 and MQ-9 on ice or snow are not
     optimum. On ice and/or snow, pilots will minimize throttle setting to that required to
     move (or sustain movement of) the aircraft and limit taxi speed to no more than 5 KGS. If
     required to stop, plan to stop over clear portions of the taxiway, if able. MQ-9 pilots will
     avoid using reverse thrust in areas of loose snow, ice and sand.
  4.3.5. Thunderstorms. The PIC will not operate the aircraft within 25 NM of known
  thunderstorm activity.

                             AIR-TO-SURFACE OPERATIONS

6.1. References. AFI 11-214 contains air-to-surface procedures applicable to all aircraft. Also
reference AFI 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, applicable range supplement and AFJI
11-204, Operational Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials. This chapter
specifies procedures or restrictions applicable to MQ-1 and MQ-9 operations. On OT&E sorties,
specific portions of this chapter may be waived by instructions contained in the operations order,
test plan, or implementation message which directs the test.
6.2. Target Identification. Crews must positively identify the target prior to weapons release.
For wartime or contingency sorties, comply with SPINS/theater Rules of Engagement (ROE).
For training sorties, achieve positive identification either visually or by confirming target
location through valid on-board/off-board cues. Examples of available means include, but are not
limited to: marking rounds, IR pointers, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), MTS, map plots, data
links, radio communications, talk-ons with joint terminal attack controllers (JTAC), RCOs, other
aircrew members, etc. Pilots will ensure they completely understand how coordinates and
elevation for their target(s) were generated and that use of this data is in compliance with all
range procedures or Rules of Engagement.
6.3. Weather Minimums. Basic weather minimums established in AFI 11-214 apply.
   6.3.1. For IMC deliveries, deliveries through an undercast, and level deliveries above 5,000‟
   AGL, there are no minimum weather requirements for weapons delivery provided the
   restrictions of paragraph 6.4.1 are complied with, as required.
6.4. Live/Heavyweight Ordnance Procedures.
   6.4.1. IMC Weapons Deliveries. Pilots may release live or inert weapons in or thru IMC
   IAW the following procedures, unless restricted by range procedures or theater ROE
   (verification requirements against known target coordinates only applies to training sorties):
       6.4.1.1. (MQ-9 only) Ballistic Ordnance releases.
           6.4.1.1.1. Verify stores management system (SMS) target coordinates against known
           target coordinates prior to release.
           6.4.1.1.2. Ensure weather minimums will allow for minimum of 8 seconds of
           available guidance time from buddy lase platform and/or ground party lasing the
           target.
       6.4.1.2. (MQ-9 only) Inertially Aided Munitions (IAM).
           6.4.1.2.1. Verify SMS target coordinates against known target coordinates prior to
           release.
               6.4.1.2.1.1. SAR derived KAATS target coordinates may be used. For training,
               verify the final KAATS derived coordinates against known target coordinates
               prior to release if available.
   6.4.2. (MQ-9 only) Inertial Aided Munitions (IAM) Bomb on-coordinate release /
   Coordinate only releases: Before releasing live or inert IAMs in a bomb-on-coordinate
 24                                                  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V3 1 NOVEMBER 2012


   mode or employing any ordnance in a system delivery mode using coordinates only (i.e.
   manually created target) verify Navigation system accuracy within 15 minutes of release by
   confirming GPS Figure of Merit (FOM) less than or equal to 5.
6.5. Battle Damage/Weapons Checks. Crews will perform a battle damage/weapons check of
weapons stations prior to or during return to base (RTB). This check is mandatory following
expenditure of live ordnance. If unable to complete check using organic sensors, ensure dearm
crew checks aircraft before taxiing to populated area.
6.6. Simulated Attacks Against Off-Range or Manned Targets. May be conducted under the
following restrictions:
   6.6.1. For wartime or contingency sorties, comply with theater SPINS/ROE. If no theater
   SPINS/ROE exists, follow training sortie rules.
   6.6.2. For training sorties:
       6.6.2.1. No live or heavyweight inert air-to-ground (A/G) ordnance (unless pinned), or
       live A/G missiles are loaded.
       6.6.2.2. The combat laser may be used only in approved areas. Do not arm the laser
       unless in approved areas and cleared for use.
6.7. (MQ-9 only) Procedures for carrying live or inert GBU 12/38 ordnance. Procedures for
carrying live or inert GBU 12/38 ordnance in conjunction with cocked Linear Electromechanical
Actuators (LEMAs) on empty stations. WARNING: There is no overt indication on the pilot
heads-up display (HUD) or stores management system (SMS) screens that differentiate between
live, inert, or simulated GBU 12/38 ordnance to include empty stations with cocked LEMAs. To
prevent inadvertent selection and release of live or inert ordnance, aircrew will adhere to the
following procedures:
   6.7.1. If live or inert GBU 12/38 ordnance is being carried in conjunction with a cocked
   LEMA on any empty station, live or inert weapons must be loaded on the inboard stations
   first. Cocked LEMAs will be configured primarily on outboard stations. If a single live or
   inert weapon is carried, it will be loaded on station 5, and LEMAs may be cocked on all
   empty stations (including station 3). If three lives or inerts are carried, station 2 will be used
   to load the outboard live/inert, and station 6 will be used for the cocked LEMA.
   6.7.2. All dry attacks will be conducted with the cocked LEMA selected. At no time will
   crews select the live or inert inboard stations until ready to release the live or inert ordnance.
   6.7.3. The cocked LEMA station(s) will not be activated (“fired”) until all live or inert
   ordnance has been visually confirmed released with the Multi-Spectral Targeting System
   (MTS).
6.8. Master Arm switch. When carrying releasable ordnance, configure IAW 11-214.
   6.8.1. For multiple weapons release passes, Master Arm switch may remained “Armed”
   unless further restricted by range guidance or theater ROE. (EXCEPTION: for training
   sorties, if the aircraft does not remain within restricted airspace or overflys “manned” sites
   during any maneuvering for subsequent passes, then “safe” the master arm switch between
   passes.)
AFI11-2MQ-1&9V3 1 NOVEMBER 2012                                                          25


  6.8.2. The use of Master Arm and release switches is authorized when not carrying
  releasable ordnance. When carrying releasable ordnance, remain two switch positions away
  from release at all times prior to intentionally releasing live or inert ordnance. The two
  deselected switches will be the master arm switch and the trigger.

                                           Chapter 7

                        ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

7.1. General. This chapter contains procedures to follow when other-than-normal
circumstances occur. The procedures in this chapter do not replace or supersede procedures
contained in the flight manual or the use of sound judgment. In all cases, data loggers and video
should be saved for review and analysis until released by the appropriate maintenance personnel.
   7.1.1. Pilots will not accept an aircraft for flight with a malfunction that is addressed in the
   emergency section of the flight manual until maintenance personnel accomplish appropriate
   corrective actions.
   7.1.2. Once a malfunctioning system is isolated, pilots will not use that system again unless
   its use in a degraded mode is essential for recovery. If the fault is corrected or malfunctioning
   item is reset, crews may continue the flight or use of the system unless prohibited by the
   flight manual.
7.2. Ground Emergencies.
   7.2.1. Pilots will not taxi with nose-wheel steering, brake system, video path, or
   telemetry/datalink malfunctions.
   7.2.2. In the event of an inadvertent entry onto soft or unprepared surfaces, pilots will not
   attempt to recover the aircraft to the prepared surface by using engine power and/or
   differential braking.
7.3. In-flight Emergencies.
   7.3.1. Air Aborts. Abort the mission, regardless of apparent damage or subsequent normal
   operation, if any of the following occur: bird strike, Over-G, flight control system anomalies
   (including uncommanded flight control inputs), or engine failure.
   7.3.2. Landing Gear Malfunctions. If encountering a landing gear malfunction and the
   gear are down, leave them down and do not make touch and go landings.
   7.3.3. Forced Landing. Comply with forced landing procedures in the flight manual. If a
   Ku-band forced landing to a runway or primary site cannot be completed without
   endangering personnel or property on the ground, then another site will be selected even if
   attempting a landing at that alternate site may result in destruction of the aircraft.
7.4. Armament System Malfunctions.
   7.4.1. Inadvertent Release. If able, record switch positions at the time of inadvertent
   release and provide to armament and safety personnel. Safe all switches. Record the impact
   point, if known. If equipment failure is suspected, do not attempt further release in any mode.
   For suspected equipment failures, follow hung ordnance procedures and RTB.
   7.4.2. Failure to Release/Hung Ordnance. If ordnance fails to release when all appropriate
   switches are set, note position of all release and fusing switches, and when operational
   constraints permit, set them to safe. Refer to TO 1Q-1(M)B-34-1-1 or TO 1Q-9(M)A-34-1-1
   as applicable.

                                     LOCAL PROCEDURES

8.1. General. This chapter is for unit local operating procedures. Procedures herein will not be
less restrictive than those contained elsewhere in this regulation, nor will this chapter be a single-
source document for procedures contained in other directives or regulations. Avoid unnecessary

Terms
Bingo Fuel—A pre-briefed fuel state that allows the aircraft to return to the base of intended
landing using preplanned recovery parameters and arriving with normal recovery fuel.

Critical Phases of Flight—Taxi, takeoff, approach, and landing; LRE/MCE handoff operations;
and terminal attack sequence (maneuver-to-attack to weapons impact both actual and simulated)
are critical phases of flight.
Hung—A hung store condition exists when a bomb has been commanded to release from the
aircraft, but fails to physically release.
Joker Fuel—A pre-briefed fuel needed to terminate an event and proceed with the remainder of
the mission.
LRE—Launch and Recovery Element. Deployed personnel based at a forward location who are
responsible for the launch, recovery and ground support of the aircraft. Launch and recovery is
accomplished using an LRGCS or GCS.
LRGCS—Launch and Recovery Ground Control Station. A modified GCS configuration
equipped with the functionality of two PSO racks and associated systems, a communications
interface and a GDT. Mission systems are not part of the configuration and an LRGCS is not
intended to retain any SATCOM capability.
MCE—Mission Control Element. A GCS (usually established in a geographically separated
location) responsible for taking an aircraft from an LRE following takeoff, executing the
mission, and then handing the aircraft back to the LRE for recovery and landing.
MSA—minimum safe altitude-The higher of a) 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within 5
NM of route of flight, or b) as locally established.
Minimum Crew—Minimum GCS crew to operate the aircraft during non-critical phases of
flight is a single pilot. A Sensor Operator or extra pilot is required during critical phases of flight.
During live/actual weapons employment involving a laser, a Sensor Operator must operate the
laser.
Normal Recovery Fuel—The fuel amount at the commencement of the initial approach or at the
FAF at the base of intended landing or alternate (if required).
Phase Manual—Phase manuals are “how to” documents that expand on basic procedures in
flight manuals and applicable USAF instructions. Training units may develop these manuals to
enhance volume and provide student crewmembers with explanatory study material. Phase
manuals provide complementary and/or more detailed aircraft maneuver or systems operation
descriptions than flight manuals and/or USAF instructions.
Remote Split Operations (RSO)—Use of LRE and MCE to conduct operations. MCE can
reside within same theater of operations or be established at a CONUS or separate OCONUS
location. RSO is extremely communication intensive and requires careful coordination between
LRE and MCE when conducting operations.
