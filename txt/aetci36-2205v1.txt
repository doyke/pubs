       1.3.3.7. Forwards a class graduation roster for all ADSC awarding courses to the
       appropriate military personnel flight ADSC point of contact (POC).
1.4. Formal Course Syllabus:
   1.4.1. A syllabus is the command-approved directive for executing each formal training
   course. The syllabus is directive and will be followed as written, unless an exception is noted
   or waiver request is approved. Prerequisite waiver, execution waiver approval authority, and
   deviation instructions are defined in each syllabus or applicable AETCI 36-2205 volume. If
   a conflict with an AFI 11-2MDS-specific publication is discovered, the AFI 11-2MDS-
   specific publication takes precedence. Notify the syllabus OPR of the conflict.
   1.4.2. Refer to AETCI 36-2221, and AFH 36-2235, Volume 8, Information for Designers of
   Instructional Systems Application to Aircrew Training, for specific guidance regarding the
   development and use of flying training syllabuses.
1.5. End-of-Course Critiques. Each organization conducting formal training administers an
end-of-course critique program as an integral part of the formal training course. The OG/CC
determines the critique’s content and medium. For contractor-provided critiques, the OG/CC or
unit responsible for contract oversight will review and authorize content and medium.
Supervisors review reports and initiate corrective action as necessary. Administer the critique
within 15 duty days prior to graduation. Use AETC Form 673, Student Critique, or an approved
local critique form for written critiques.
1.6. Aircrew Graduate Evaluation Program. Refer to AETCI 36-2206, Aircrew Graduate
Evaluation Program, for specific program guidance. A web-based feedback instrument is
available at https://www.my.af.mil/agepiftprod. For more information contact AETC/A3F.
1.7. Training Folders. Training folders and personal information folders belong to the Air
Force. Personnel must safeguard training folders at all times. Loss or destruction of these
documents could subject the member to adverse administrative action, as well as possible
prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Squadron personnel must brief students
on potential adverse administrative actions.
1.8. Commander’s Awareness Program (CAP):
   1.8.1. Objective. The objective of CAP is to focus supervisory attention on a student’s
   progress in training/screening, specific deficiencies, and potential to complete the program.
   CAP may also be used to monitor personal issues requiring supervisory attention. Note:
   CAP does not apply to courses of 7 training days or less, or Air Advisor Flight Training
   Courses; however, when CAP does not apply to a training program, it will be specifically
   excluded in the training syllabus: “CAP does not apply.”
       1.8.1.1. Categories. CAP is divided into the following categories:
          1.8.1.1.1. Flying or Airmanship. Students demonstrating flying deficiencies in an
          ATD or aircraft.
          1.8.1.1.2. Procedural. Students exhibiting substandard general or EP knowledge.
          1.8.1.1.3. Academic. Students exhibiting substandard academic performance.
 8                                                       AETCI36-2205V1 7 NOVEMBER 2013


            1.8.1.1.4. Airsickness. Physiological Incidents. Students exhibiting airsickness,
            manifestation of apprehension (MOA), G-Induced Loss of Consciousness (G-LOC),
            etc.
            1.8.1.1.5. Military.    Students exhibiting substandard military or professional
            behavior.
            1.8.1.1.6. Other. Students with personal issues requiring supervisory attention.
     1.8.2. Squadron Commander (SQ/CC) Responsibilities.              The flying SQ/CC (or
     equivalent) administers the program. The day-to-day CAP administration may be delegated
     to the squadron operations officer SQ/DO, squadron assistant operations officer (SQ/ADO),
     Flight Commander (FLT/CC), flight supervisor, or designated student training manager.
     SQ/CC will be briefed prior to removing a student from CAP so the SQ/CC is aware of
     everyone who is removed from CAP. Class commanders may place students on military
     CAP, if specifically authorized in local guidance.
        1.8.2.1. AETC/A3QF will act as SQ/CC for all Non-USAF /Air Advisor aircraft training
        locations.
     1.8.3. Local Guidance. Units (or specific AETCI 36-2205 volume will provide) will
     develop specific CAP guidance as it relates to the unit’s mission. This guidance addresses
     such topics as criteria for different CAP categories, notification processes, student or training
     activity restrictions, instructor continuity requirements, documentation requirements, and
     placement and removal procedures.
     1.8.4. CAP Procedures. The SQ/CC or approved delegate places the student on CAP and
     removes the student from CAP when sustained normal progress is demonstrated or when
     personal issues are resolved. Although CAP is intended to be a short-term program (one to
     two weeks), removal should not be strictly event based (for example, solo or passing a
     performance check) if the student’s weak areas can carry over into the next category or
     phase.
        1.8.4.1. While a student is on CAP, tailor training to address the student’s particular
        situation within the limits of the syllabus. The FLT/CC (or delegated authority) closely
        monitors instructor continuity and ensures proficiency standards are not compromised to
        permit CAP students to progress in training.
        1.8.4.2. The FLT/CC (or delegated authority) will counsel the student when placed on
        and removed from CAP. Initial counseling will cover CAP objectives, student training
        plan, instructor continuity, and CAP removal goals. Additional counseling is done at the
        discretion of the immediate supervisor but is required if the student fails to meet the CAP
        removal goals. The supervisor will update goals appropriately and will document all
        counseling in the student’s training folder.
        1.8.4.3. The student’s FLT/CC (or delegated authority) will brief squadron leadership
        weekly on the student’s progress. As a minimum, this briefing will include the student’s
        strong and weak areas, description of individual training events completed, potential to
        graduate, and anticipated removal date from CAP.
1.9. Duty Day. Students in formal flying training programs do not perform duties in excess of
12 hours per day unless authorized in the applicable syllabus.

                                  ACADEMIC TRAINING

2.1. Scheduling Training. Each additional volume of this AETCI shall provide scheduling
restrictions, as required. However, the actual duration limit for student academic training will
not exceed eight (8) hours for “new”, testable material during each training day. Examinations
or formal testing time shall count toward the eight hour academic day duration limitation
computation.
2.2. Academic Instructor (AI) Responsibilities: See AETCI 36-2204, Flying Training
Instructor Programs for guidance.
2.3. Absentee Records. Record student absences on AETC Form 62, Absentee Report, or
locally developed and approved equivalent. Do not complete this form if a computer system
such as TIMS or GTIMS is available or if all students are present. Keep these records for
administrative purposes and destroy after class graduation.
2.4. Examinations. The minimum passing score is 85 percent. Only a course-qualified AI may
administer examinations. During examinations, instructors answer questions only to clarify the
meaning of questions or answers. Instructors should avoid answering in a manner to change a
student’s confidence in an answer or directing a path for problem resolution. Anything said to
one student should be shared with the entire class. AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew
Standardization/Evaluation Program, authorizes using end-of-course exams to fulfill the
requirements of requisite examinations.
   2.4.1. AETC Form 26, Standard Answer Sheet (50 Items), AETC Form 26A, Standard
   Answer Sheet (100 items), or AETC Form 26B, Standard Answer Sheet (200 items), may be
   used to answer examination questions if approved electronic exam program is not available.
   2.4.2. Academic Instructors (AI) evaluate and grade students in formal flying training
   courses to:
       2.4.2.1. Tell them how well they achieved the learning objectives.
       2.4.2.2. Identify outstanding performance for special recognition and poor performance
       for special assistance or additional training.
       2.4.2.3. Identify students who fail to meet the standards required for satisfactory course
       completion.
       2.4.2.4. Provide data for analysis and improvement of various aspects of the training
       program.
   2.4.3. An examination control monitor:
       2.4.3.1. Manages and stores examinations, answer sheets, answer keys, compact disks,
       and item analyses in a locked metal file cabinet or safe. Electronic examinations must
       have appropriate password security procedures and need not comply with the above
       requirements.

       2.4.3.2. Ensures all materials, including test analyses and item analyses, are always
       secure from unauthorized viewing, and maintains a list of personnel authorized to remove
       examinations.
       2.4.3.3. Conducts an inventory of examinations every 6 months or whenever an
       examination compromise is suspected. Immediately notifies AETC/A3F or AETC/A3Z,
       as appropriate when an examination is compromised.
       2.4.3.4. Destroys examinations when materials become obsolete, surplus, damaged, or
       illegible. Records this action on AETC Form 157, Examination Control Log.
   2.4.4. Personnel document examination removals on AETC Form 157. Each examination
   requires a separate AETC Form 157. Instructors record the date and time, number sequence
   of examinations, name of person removing the examination, and reason for removal on
   AETC Form 157. Destroy the form 6 months after the last entry.
   2.4.5. For courses managed by AETC/A3F, do not change examination, discard questions, or
   do anything to affect the results of the examination without approval from AETC/A3FO. If
   contact cannot be made in a reasonable time, the Air Force site representative may delete a
   question made obsolete because of changes to a technical order, aeronautical publication, or
   Air Force publication. AETC/A3FO responds to the submitting unit within 3 duty days.
   2.4.6. Suggested changes to graduate courses or examinations are submitted to the
   appropriate courseware provider.
2.5. Reporting Procedures:
   2.5.1. Statistical Analysis. AIs should complete a statistical item analysis for course
   examinations. AFMAN 36-2236, Guidebook for Air Force Instructors, describes analysis
   methods. UFT programs are encouraged to use the Instructor Exam Reporting Tool (IERT)
   for statistical analysis.
   2.5.2. Student Critiques. Critiques will cover as a minimum the following areas: instructor
   professionalism, instructor knowledge, instructor presentation, computer based training, and
   courseware support.
2.6. Academic Training Inspections. Inspect academic activities with a minimum interruption
to training. AIs continue their presentation and do not report to the inspector. Do not call
students to attention. Evaluators or inspectors should enter the classroom before the class begins
or during breaks. Explain these procedures to visiting personnel.

                                      HUMAN FACTORS

3.1. Physical Fitness. Implement AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program, and align minimum fitness
assessment standards with the most current AF instruction. Unit commanders are responsible
under AFI 36-2905, which includes fitness program responsibilities for TDY personnel. This
policy does not apply to USAFA cadets participating in airmanship courses. Refer to the
applicable syllabus for specific guidance.
   3.1.1. Formal course students will continue to complete official fitness assessments (FA)
   IAW AFI 36-2905 and will continue to maintain individual year-round physical fitness
   during formal course enrollment.
   3.1.2. Formal training unit commanders for all Permanent Change of Station (PCS) formal
   courses will establish a process to ensure they are aware of fitness case files (open and
   closed) during in-processing before the start of formal training. Formal training unit
   commanders will document this process in their unit fitness program written policy.
   3.1.3. Formal training unit commanders:
      3.1.3.1. Will establish processes to ensure they are aware of and continue to support
      members in a fitness improvement program prescribed by their unit commander for all
      TDY formal courses over 6 weeks (42 calendar days).
      3.1.3.2. Will ensure formal course students continue to meet all intervention program
      requirements (if entered) during their TDY.
   3.1.4. UFT students will not graduate, nor be awarded an aviation rating without a current
   Excellent / Satisfactory score. In addition to the requirements of AFI 36-2905, continue
   advanced phase UFT students with a current Unsatisfactory FA score in training, but place
   them on administrative hold prior to class graduation. These students will either pass the FA
   and graduate, or be eliminated from undergraduate training through a Commander’s Review.
3.2. Standards and Discipline:
   3.2.1. Objective. According to AETCI 36-2216, Administration of Military Standards and
   Discipline Training, the objective of standards and discipline is to reinforce training initiated
   during basic military training or officer training and to continue emphasizing core values,
   equal opportunity and treatment, and environmental awareness.
   3.2.2. Military Customs, Courtesies, and Traditions. Students must understand customs,
   courtesies, and traditions play a time-honored role in the military profession and serve as an
   integral part of their development as professionals and future leaders. Group commanders
   are encouraged to establish a program of activities to reinforce traditional military customs
   and courtesies to prepare students for future leadership roles. Depending on student load and
   training requirements, this program may include parades, reveilles, retreats, and inspections.
   3.2.3. Instructor and Student Relationships. Professional conduct and relationships are
   essential to a quality training environment. Students and instructors are expected to maintain
   high standards of bearing and behavior, and demonstrate a professional attitude toward
   superiors and subordinates. All training conduct and relationships must comply with AFI 36-
 12                                                   AETCI36-2205V1 7 NOVEMBER 2013


   2909, Professional and Unprofessional Relationships, and AETCI 36-2909, Professional and
   Unprofessional Relationships.
3.3. Medical Management. (N/A Initial Flight Screening, see AETCI 36-2205, Volume 3,
Formal Flying Training Administration and Management—Initial Flight Screening. This
section, AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards and AETCI 48-102, Medical
Management of Undergraduate Flying Training Students, establish student management
requirements for flight surgeons and operations personnel. Operations and medical personnel
must ensure commanders are informed when students exhibit MOA symptoms or other medical
conditions affecting daily student training decisions. They must also strive to keep students
motivated and flying on a regular basis. Note: In the event of a physiological incident during an
Air Advisor flight training course, students must see a US military or equivalent flight surgeon
before resuming flight training.
   3.3.1. Airsickness. The airsickness management program is outlined in AETCI 48-102.
   There are two types of airsickness: active and passive. Active airsickness includes vomiting
   while passive airsickness only involves discomfort or nausea but still results in a significant
   deviation in the mission profile or the student’s ability to complete tasks.
   3.3.2. Manifestation of Apprehension:
       3.3.2.1. Definition. MOA is a state of psychological anxiety, apprehension, or physical
       impairment that students exhibit toward their training environment.
       3.3.2.2. Symptoms. MOA symptoms may include passive or active airsickness,
       insomnia, appetite loss, anxiety, or tension related to the flying or controlling
       environment. Students may try to mask MOA symptoms with frequent vague medical
       problems, frequent visits to the flight surgeon, lack of preparation, or day dreaming.
       Performance deterioration or airsickness is more common and occurs over a long period.
       3.3.2.3. Identification. At times, the best possible identification of MOA is an
       instructor’s subjective evaluation. A student’s sudden lack of motivation, negative
       attitude toward learning, loss of sense of humor, or other personality changes may
       indicate MOA. The instructor informs the FLT/CC when a student’s performance is
       impaired because of actual or suspected MOA.
       3.3.2.4. Management Procedures. The SQ/CC or FLT/CC requests a flight surgeon
       examination for a student with MOA symptoms. If no psychological or physical
       problems are present, the student is medically qualified for flying and controlling duties.
       The decision to eliminate a student for MOA reasons is an operational decision based on
       mission impairment and operational risk management (ORM). The SQ/CC reviews the
       student’s training record and enters justification for recommending elimination for MOA.
       For elimination procedures for rated crewmembers with MOA, refer to AFI 11-402 as
       supplemented.
   3.3.3. Inflight G-Tolerance Problems. For students experiencing G-tolerance difficulties,
   supervisors should refer to AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training for High-G Aircrew; AFPAM
   11-419, G-Awareness for Aircrew; and AETCI 11-406, Fighter Aircrew Conditioning
   Program (FACP). Following a G-tolerance incident, the FLT/CC reviews the student’s
   training folder and discusses anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM) procedures with the student
AETCI36-2205V1 7 NOVEMBER 2013                                                             13


  to ensure maximum training effectiveness.        Document any G-tolerance incident in the
  student’s training folder.
     3.3.3.1. G-induced Physiological Incidents:
        3.3.3.1.1. G-force induced G-LOC and visual blackout are considered G-induced
        physiological incidents.
        3.3.3.1.2. When a student experiences a G-induced physiological incident, the
        instructor terminates the sortie and grades the event according to the syllabus and/or
        other volumes of this is instruction. The instructor ensures Wing Safety is notified
        immediately after landing. A flight surgeon evaluates any student who experiences
        in-flight G-tolerance problems.
        3.3.3.1.3. The OG/CC reviews the circumstances surrounding each G-induced
        physiological incident and determines the appropriate action. Report the incident as a
        physiological incident or mishap IAW AFI 48-123 and AFI 91-204, Safety
        Investigations and Reports. The OG/CC may delegate the review process to the
        flying SQ/CC.
        3.3.3.1.4. Except for F-35A the student flies the next sortie dual as a minimum.
            3.3.3.1.4.1. As a minimum, F-35A students will perform a G-awareness exercise
            during the next training sortie IAW 11-2F-35A Volume 3, F-35A--Operations
            Procedures.
        3.3.3.1.5. Document every G-induced physiological incident in the student’s training
        folder.
        3.3.3.1.6. Procedures for flight surgeon and Aerospace Physiologist (AP) or trained
        Air Force personnel (TAFP) follow:
            3.3.3.1.6.1. If a G-induced physiological incident is the result of an improper
            AGSM, the flight surgeon refers the student to the AP or TAFP, as appropriate,
            for a one-on-one training session to be accomplished before the next aircraft
            lesson. The session includes proper AGSM use. The AP or TAFP, as
            appropriate, evaluates the student’s AGSM performance to determine if additional
            instruction is necessary.
            3.3.3.1.6.2. A G-induced physiological incident caused by an easily remedied
            medical reason, such as dehydration, does not require additional AGSM training.
            Flight surgeons may use counseling as an effective training method. G-intolerance
            for an unresolved cause is a reason for elimination from training. Refer all
            student cases pending elimination for G-intolerance after completion of the
            primary phase of UPT to AETC/A3F, AETC/A3Z, AETC/A3Q, NGB/A3,
            AFRC/A3T, and AFRC home unit, as appropriate, for review.
            3.3.3.1.6.3. G-induced physiological incidents may require a medical waiver
            prior to return to flying duties IAW AFI 48-123.
        3.3.3.1.7. Procedures for students experiencing more than one G-induced
        physiological incident follow:
            3.3.3.1.7.1. A second G-induced physiological incident caused by an improper
14                                                   AETCI36-2205V1 7 NOVEMBER 2013


            AGSM requires evaluation and training in the centrifuge before the student may
            continue in the course flow. Note: International students are exempt.
            3.3.3.1.7.2. If a student experiences a second G-induced physiological incident in
            a formal flying training course, the flight surgeon reports the situation to
            AETC/SGP before clearing the student for further flying.
        3.3.3.1.8. The FLT/CC:
            3.3.3.1.8.1. Reviews the student’s training folder and discusses AGSM
            procedures with the student to ensure maximum training effectiveness.
            3.3.3.1.8.2. Restricts a student in dual-seat aircraft to dual-only flying until
            completion of initial centrifuge training. This restriction applies to a student
            experiencing a G-related incident before completing a formal flying training
            course requiring centrifuge training. If the student fails to complete centrifuge
            training, refer to AFI 11-404 to determine the appropriate course of action.
        3.3.3.1.9. For flying training units, the flight surgeon forwards a summary of the
        medical evaluation to AETC/SGP. A healthy student who is unable to perform
        satisfactorily under G-forces despite repeat centrifuge training is administratively
        handled as follows:
            3.3.3.1.9.1. (Active Duty Students) If administrative procedures move the
            student to a low-G weapon system, AETC/A3F, AETC/A3Z, or AETC/A3Q
            determines whether the individual should be restricted from future duties as a
            pilot or an instructor pilot in aerobatic aircraft. If such a restriction is warranted,
            AETC/A3F, AETC/A3Z, or AETC/A3Q informs AFPC/DPAO by memorandum.
            3.3.3.1.9.2. (ANG and AFRC Students) If administrative procedures move the
            student to a low-G weapon system, AETC/A3F, AETC/A3Z, or AETC/A3Q
            determines whether the individual should be restricted from future duties as a
            pilot or an instructor pilot in aerobatic aircraft. If such restrictions are warranted,
            the AETC/A3F, AETC/A3Z, or AETC/A3Q informs the NGB/A3 or AFRC/A3
            by memorandum, who then informs the student’s home unit by memorandum and
            waits for notification of the student’s reassignment or classification.
     3.3.3.2. Centrifuge Training. Conduct centrifuge training IAW AFI 11-404.
  3.3.4. Administrative Requirements for Flying Training Supervisors and Flight
  Surgeons:
     3.3.4.1. Flight surgeons will notify flying/formal training units of a student’s restrictions
     on an AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty
     completed during initial screening, or any subsequent Flight Surgeon’s Office (FSO) visit
     conducted during training. Other relevant information required to determine fitness of a
     student will be disclosed IAW AFI 41-210, Tricare Operations and Patient
     Administration, Section 6E.
        3.3.4.1.1. Commanders may release information provided by the FSO IAW AFI 41-
        210, to determine the fitness of a student to begin/continue training. This sensitive
        information should only be released in accordance with the Privacy Act 1974, to
AETCI36-2205V1 7 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  15


         members of the commander’s staff (DO, Flt/CC/Lead instructor etc.) deemed
         necessary to make a determination of fitness to begin/continue training.
         3.3.4.1.2. Flying training supervisors forward a list of flying restrictions listed in the
         AF Form 1042 for each student to the gaining units.
     3.3.4.2. An instructor or squadron supervisor may direct a student to visit the flight
     surgeon, or a student may self-initiate the visit.
     3.3.4.3. The FTU Staff or contractor will document all FSO or PTO visits causing a
     training impact on an AF Form 4293, Student Activity Record, or locally produced
     document. Document any recommended flying restrictions after a directed or self-
     initiated visit. File the form in the weapon system specific training management system
     (i.e., TIMS, GTIMS, TMS, etc.) or training folder.
         3.3.4.3.1. For international students, the AF Form 4293 may be maintained
         separately by the International Military Student Office.
  3.3.5. Administrative Procedures for Temporary Medical Disqualifications.
     3.3.5.1. Only appropriately credentialed medical professionals determine when students
     are medically disqualified for flying duty. Medical personnel communicate changes in
     medical qualification by telephone and/or the AF Form 1042 or another Service’s
     equivalent. For temporary medical disqualifications, the AF Form 1042 includes an
     estimated duration of the medical disqualification (“Estimated Duration of DNIF”).
     3.3.5.2. For rated officer and mission qualified career enlisted aviator formal course
     students, AETC/A2/3/10 authorizes the wing commander (or equivalent) to
     administratively disenroll formal course students for medical disqualifications that do not
     warrant an administrative hold or exceed the authorized duration. Use AETC Form 125A
     or the elimination form prescribed in the appropriate AETCI 36-2205 volume (e.g.,
     AETC Form 140). Disenroll cadets, T-1A, T-6A, T-38C and TH-1H graduate course
     students, and undergraduate students through a CR. Formal course students who are
     disenrolled from training in these circumstances may attend the training at a future date if
     the medical condition is resolved and the student otherwise remains qualified for the
     training.
     3.3.5.3. After consulting with medical personnel, operations supervisors make
     administrative decisions on a formal course student’s ability to continue in training. The
     wing commander (or equivalent) must approve initial placement on administrative hold
     as a result of medical disqualifications. Specifically:
         3.3.5.3.1. A formal course student whose medical disqualification is expected to last
         less than 30 days, or the course duration (whichever is shorter) may continue in
         training. Exception: All Initial Flight Screening students whose condition is not
         expected to be resolved within 5 days will be administratively disenrolled from the
         course. Air Advisor students whose condition is not expected to be resolved in within
         5 days will be at the discretion of AETC/A3Q.
         3.3.5.3.2. A formal course student whose medical disqualification is expected to last
         more than 30 days or the course duration (whichever is shorter) will be placed on
         administrative hold if their medical condition is expected to be resolved within 12
16                                                  AETCI36-2205V1 7 NOVEMBER 2013


        months and the unit anticipates the student can continue in training. Exception:
        Cadet students in USAFA airmanship courses AM-100, AM-251, AM-420, and AM-
        490 may continue in a training status until the course expiration (final scheduled
        academic lesson or end of summer period) without elimination. Document
        administrative hold for medical disqualification in the student’s training record;
        document the date of placement and the anticipated date of removal. Make an entry
        in the student’s training record if this situation changes.
        3.3.5.3.3. If the unit anticipates the formal course student will not be able to continue
        in training after the medical condition is resolved, the student will be disenrolled from
        training.
     3.3.5.4. Duration of administrative hold for medical disqualifications and required
     coordination:
        3.3.5.4.1. The wing commander (or equivalent) may authorize administrative hold
        for up to 6 months, or the course duration (whichever is shorter). When formal
        course students are expected to remain medically disqualified longer than the 6
        months or the course duration (whichever is shorter) they should be eliminated from
        training. Before the wing commander authorizes an administrative hold over 3
        months, the unit must coordinate the recommendation with either AETC/A3F,
        AETC/A3Z, or AETC/A3Q (as appropriate) and AETC/SGP. Recommendations for
        administrative hold longer than 3 months must be accompanied by a recommendation
        from both the attending flight surgeon and the unit commander. Do not include
        protected health information IAW DoD 6025.18-R, DoD Health Information Privacy
        Regulation. Units may use AETC Form 6 to document this authorization.
        3.3.5.4.2. AETC/A3F, AETC/A3Z, or AETC/A3Q (as appropriate) may authorize an
        administrative hold for up to 12 months. When formal course students are expected
        to remain medically disqualified longer than the 12 months or the course duration
        (whichever is shorter) they will be administratively disenrolled from course. Before
        either AETC/A3F, AETC/A3Z, or AETC/A3Q authorizes an administrative hold over
        6 months, coordinate the recommendation with AETC/SGP. Recommendations for
