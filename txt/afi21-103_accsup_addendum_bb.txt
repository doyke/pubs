This MESL compliments AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting.
This Addendum applies to all F-22A ACC, Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) units and members. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records. Contact supporting records managers as required.
Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using Air Force Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to
HQ ACC/A4V22, 204 Dodd Blvd., Suite 112, Langley AFB VA 23665-2791, and send
information copies to the applicable Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR). This publication

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: Note 11 is revised to allow PMC for TF coded aircraft and is now note 8. Note 16 is
now note * applicable to all columns and all lines and was revised to further standardize the
debrief process and aircraft status reporting.

1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the ground
work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential systems and
subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime,
training, test or other missions. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness Status of
Resources and Training System (SORTS) reporting only and denotes Mission Capable (MC)
aircraft capable of being configured for a contingency mission IAW COMACC OMNIBUS Plan.
     1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex
     degraded mission systems such as suspension equipment.
     1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment. The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
     Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC.
     A Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can
     be configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
     1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
     Command (MAJCOM) differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to
     another MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and
     specify the unit's requirements and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
     1.4. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by Logistics
     Control Number (LCN) against the FSL and all applicable BSLs across the page. Each unit’s
     Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines applicability of BSL columns.
     The aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft; therefore, it is important to
     compare only those columns listed in the MESL which are applicable to the unit’s assigned
     aircraft. For example, units with CC (wartime) coded aircraft would determine and report
     status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to their DOC statement. Units with TF
     (training) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and TNG
     columns, and units with CB (evaluation) coded aircraft would determine and report status
     using only the FSL and TST columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is
     reported using the MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code.

    QUALIFYING NOTES:

    1. Both radios and backup must have full functionality (UHF, VHF, secure, Have Quick) for FMC.
     Both radios must have partial capability; one (1) UHF and one (1) VHF or one (1) radio must be
    fully functional for PMC.

  2. Exterior lighting required per AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules. Landing light and all strobe lights required for
  PMC.
  3. Two (2) of three (3) operational SMFDs and PMFD, HUD, RUFD required for PMC.
  4. For Air to Air configuration any combination of six (6) of the eight (8) internal weapons stations to include a
  minimum of one (1) Aim 9M station required for PMC.
  5. Inoperative weapons station 2 and or 11 is considered PMC.
  6. For Air-to Ground configuration only six (6) internal weapons stations are available and All
  (6) of these stations are required for FMC. One (1) AIM-9M station may be inoperative for PMC.
  7. Five (5) of six (6) MLD sensors required for PMC.
  8. During peacetime operations, LO system reporting codes for combat coded (CC) aircraft are FMC or NMC-
  Airworthy. The F-22 LO system is FMC when the Signature Assessment System (SAS) margins-used are < 100% and
  F119 LO coatings are within Engine SAS (ESAS) limits. The LO system status on CC aircraft is NMC-Airworthy
  when the SAS margin is > 100% or engine coating loss exceeds ESAS limits, as long as un-repaired LO damages do
  not affect structural integrity and/or Safety of Flight. PMC for the LO system on CC aircraft is only authorized during
  combat/contingency/alert operations (to include theater security packages/cooperation missions). PMC for the LO
  system on training coded aircraft is authorized provided un-repaired LO anomalies do not affect applicable ACC/A3
  training syllabi, structural integrity, and/or safety of flight.
  9. Loss of one IFDL MBA is PMC.
  10. Inoperative gun system is PMC.
  11. DMVR malfunctions that only affect recording of displays are PMC.
  * For FRCs that assert a system "Degrade" in conjunction with pilot observed performance degradation, the aircraft
  status will be reported as PMC. For FRCs which asserts a system "FAIL" in conjunction with pilot observed
  performance degradation, the aircraft will be reported as NMC.
