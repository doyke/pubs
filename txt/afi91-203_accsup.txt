        special operations aircraft) that are located within a Fuel Servicing Safety Zone (FSSZ)
        as described in TO 00-25-172, will be UL-listed, explosion proof, and approved for use
        in Class 1 Division 1 and/or Class 1 Division 2 locations.
        24.3.3. Additional guidance may be provided by Air Force Engineering Technical

            following requirements are met:
                24.3.3.1.1.1. (Added) Non-explosion proof and non-intrinsically safe
                computers, NDI equipment, and electrical test equipment will not be used

            for the storage and disposal of hazardous waste. Contact your Civil Engineering
            Installation Management Flight, Environmental Management Office, or unit
            hazardous waste monitor for additional guidance regarding disposal of hazardous
            waste/materials. Safety and Bioenvironmental engineers may also be contacted
            for assistance.

       24.15.4.1. Pintle hook safety pins will be installed at all times to prevent possible
       disconnect of equipment, and accidental loss of pin, creating potential FOD. Safety
       lock pins shall be of proper size in length and be attached with a chain in accordance
       with TO 36-1-121.

     color coded for mishap prevention purposes, i.e., Danger (Red), Caution (Yellow),
     Warning (Orange), etc., will comply with governing directives (reference manual on
     Uniform Traffic Control Devices, ANSI Standards, AFOSH/OSHA Standards, Air Force
     Directives to include TOs; also paragraph 29.3.1. of this standard). For specific signs and
     color code markings in storage and material handling areas, consult AFJMAN 23-210,
     Joint Services Manual (JSM) for Storage and Material Handling.
         29.3.5.14. Signs and requirements for display of signs will be in accordance with AFI
         40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials, in the US Air Force, (available in the BEE
         office) and local BEE evaluation and recommendations. BEE personnel will provide
         recommendations and guidance on procurement and placement of the proper signs.
         29.3.5.15. (Added) Laser hazard signs will be posted in accordance with AFI 48-
         139, Laser and Optical Radiation Protection Program, ANSI Z136.1, Safe Use of
