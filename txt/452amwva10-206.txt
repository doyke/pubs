Immediate Actions to be taken during FPCON CHARLIE:
1.   Were FPCON "CHARLIE" signs posted appropriately on all entry/exit doors?
2.   At regular intervals, brief personnel on the updated threat and inform/remind personnel of the effect of FPCON
     "CHARLIE" and the measures to be taken. Ensure personnel arriving for duty are briefed on the threat. Also,
     remind them to be alert for and to report suspicious activities, such as the presence of unfamiliar personnel and
     vehicles, suspicious parcels, and possible surveillance attempts.
3.   Were all personnel responsible for implementing antiterrorism plans kept at their place of duty?
4.   Increase standoff distance from sensitive buildings based on the threat. Implement barrier plan to hinder
     vehicle-borne attack.
5.   Is control of entry in to the facility strictly enforced?
6.   Cover or remove facility designation/identification signs.
7.   Increase random security checks of persons entering the facility. Were random inspections done on all
     personnel and were all visitors inspected to include all suitcases, briefcases, parcels and any other containers?
8.   Were all government vehicles dispersed around our facilities to eliminate the potential for attack?
9.   Review all FPCON DELTA measures.
