                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Program Management. This instruction implements policy, assigns responsibility, and
establishes procedures for motor vehicle traffic supervision on Yokota AB. IAW AFI 31-
101_374 AWSUP, Integrated Defense, Yokota AB is designated as a “closed” installation,
which warrants stringent entry control.
1.2. Responsibilities. The provisions of this instruction will be in compliance with AFMAN
31-116, AFI 31-218(I), USFJI 31-205, and US Code of Federal Regulations Title 32, National
Defense, Part 634.
1.3. Delegation of Authority. On Yokota AB, the duties of the Wing Traffic Review Officer
(WTRO) have been delegated to the 374th Mission Support Group Deputy Commander (374
MSG/CD). As such, the 374 MSG/CD acts as the Installation Commander’s representative to
identify high-risk drivers, and authorize the issuance of preliminary suspension or revocation
letters concerning traffic offenders and will be the approving authority for all limited driving
requests. The 374 MSG Deputy Director (374 MSG/DD) will fill this position during the
absence of 374 MSG/CD.
   1.3.1. The provisions of AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and YOKOTA ABI 31-101,
   Yokota Air Base Integrated Defense, will be complied with for all visitor vehicle entry
   requirements (i.e., physically escorting or denial to the installation).

                                             Chapter 2

                                    DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges. “Driving privilege,” as used in this instruction,
includes the privileges extended by the installation commander (374 AW Commander [374
AW/CC]) to drive on Yokota AB and to drive anywhere in Japan based on the issuance of USFJ
Form 4EJ, U.S. Forces, Japan Operator’s Permit for Civilian Vehicle (PA), or Optional Form
(OF) 346, U.S. Government Motor Vehicle Operator’s Identification Card. Acceptance of that
privilege compels compliance with the laws and instructions governing motor vehicle operation
and registration within Japan. Consequently, all military personnel, Department of Defense
(DoD) civilian employees, DoD contractors and family members will have the following items
listed below in their privately owned vehicle at all times:
     2.1.1. Military Registration and Certificate of Title of Motor Vehicle.
     2.1.2. AF Form 2293 and/or USFJ Form 4EJ for the type of vehicle being operated.
     2.1.3. DoD Identification card (SOFA personnel).
     2.1.4. Proof of Japan Compulsory Insurance (JCI) and property damage liability insurance
     (PDI). Any vehicle operated in Japan must have JCI. US Forces personnel covered by the
     SOFA must also have additional liability insurance IAW USFJI 31-205 (see Attachment 6).
     2.1.5. Current year USFJ Form 15A, Vehicle Registration Decal (for Use on 4-Wheel
     Vehicles), or USFJ Form 15B, Vehicle Registration Decal (for Use on 2-Wheel Vehicles),
     properly affixed to the motor vehicle.
     2.1.6. Japan vehicle registration (inspection) card, with Japanese road-use tax stamp attached
     (not applicable to motor vehicle assigned “OV” numbers).
2.2. USFJ Form 4EJ.
     2.2.1. The minimum standards for obtaining a USFJ Form 4EJ are as follows:
        2.2.1.1. Applicant must present a valid (current) operator's permit issued by any state or
        territory of the US or by the District of Columbia; an international driver's permit, a valid
        Government of Japan (GOJ) operator’s permit; or written proof that he or she has
        successfully completed a certified formal driving course, either offered on-base or from a
        certified stateside driving course.
        2.2.1.2. Members with an expired state-side license are encouraged to contact their
        respective state Department of Motor Vehicles for current procedures addressing renewal
        of licenses for military-affiliated personnel. Many states allow licenses issued to military
        personnel, their family members, and DoD civilian employees, to remain valid,
        irrespective of expiration date, while they continue to serve in an overseas assignment or
        until the next return visit to the state. Others allow renewal by mail.
        2.2.1.3. Installations may renew the USFJ Form 4EJ when the requestor (with an expired
        state license) presents documentation that the state permits licenses to remain valid until
        return from overseas.
YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013                                                                         7


     2.2.1.4. For those members with an expired state license whose state does not permit
     extension while overseas, renewal by mail, etc., the installation commander may grant a
     waiver for a renewal of the USFJ Form 4EJ, given the individual's driving record while at
     the installation is acceptable, and the individual attests to the fact that their expired state-
     side license has not been revoked, suspended or removed for cause. In addition, a check
     with the NHTSA National Drivers Registry will be conducted to verify status. This
     authority may be delegated to the Base Traffic Review Officer, or equivalent position,
     but not delegated further.
     2.2.1.5. Refer to USFJI 31-205, paragraph 2.2.1.3. for issuance of USFJ Form 4EJ for
     SOFA sponsored personnel not covered above in paragraph 2.2.1.1.
  2.2.2. USFJ personnel arriving at Yokota AB from another USFJ installation must attend the
  local road conditions course at the newcomer’s briefing. If their USFJ 4EJ is still valid, it
  can be used until its expiration date; otherwise, a new USFJ Form 4EJ will be issued.
     2.2.2.1. Personnel PCSing to or returning to USFJ installations must attend the Local
     Road Conditions Course at the newcomer’s briefing to obtain a new driver’s permit.
  2.2.3. Personnel who do not possess a valid USFJ Form 4EJ will not be allowed to operate
  their vehicle, except as specified in this instruction.
  2.2.4. Personnel who misplace their USFJ Form 4EJ will obtain written authorization from
  the sponsor’s squadron commander, or first sergeant before a replacement USFJ Form 4EJ
  will be reissued.
  2.2.5. The WTRO can authorize a “FOR ON-BASE USE ONLY” USFJ Form 4EJ to family
  members, stepparents, or guardians authorized to use base facilities. This special application
  should be granted on the basis of reducing hardships imposed on members and/or their
  families by illness, deployment(s) or extenuating circumstances. Requests for special
  licensing consideration should be forwarded directly to the WTRO. Vehicle operators
  granted this special consideration must complete the installation driver’s safety course prior
  to receipt of the USFJ Form 4EJ.
  2.2.6. Student Driving Permits:
     2.2.6.1. Applies to SOFA sponsored dependents between the ages of 16-18 years and
     who have not been issued a stateside license/permit prior to arriving at Yokota AB.
     2.2.6.2. The process for gaining a Student Driving Permit is as follows:
         2.2.6.2.1. Upon an individual’s 16th birthday, they can attend the Local Conditions
         Driving Course conducted by the 374 AW Safety Office. Once this is complete, the
         student driver and parent/guardian will bring the completed 374 AW Form 50 to Pass
         and Registration.
         2.2.6.2.2. Pass and Registration will issue a temporary USFJ Form 4EJ, Drivers
         Operating Permit, good for six months, overstamped with “Student Driver’s Permit”
         and “Must be accompanied by parent or guardian at all times.”
     2.2.6.3. Student driving permits allow young drivers an opportunity to practice driving
     on base only and under the supervision of their parent or guardian until they are able to
     complete the formal Drivers Education Class (DEC) offered by the Taiyo Recreation
 8                                                              YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013


        Center. If the individual cannot complete the DEC within the first six months, an
        extension can be requested to Pass and Registration. Upon completion of the DEC, they
        are eligible to receive an unaccompanied, on base only Drivers Operating Permit.
2.3. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
     2.3.1. The Installation commander is responsible for protecting personnel and property under
     his or her jurisdiction and maintaining good order and discipline on the installation.
     Although not inclusive, this is conducted through aggressive programs, such as:
        2.3.1.1. Installation entry and/or exit point checks.
        2.3.1.2. Sobriety checkpoints.
        2.3.1.3. Unannounced checkpoints for the safety and security of the wing.
        2.3.1.4. Force protection measures.
     2.3.2. Personnel attempting to elude and/or evade or failing to submit to a checkpoint will
     lose their driving privileges for up to one year and/or up to a six point assessment.
2.4. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath, or Urine test.
     2.4.1. Drivers give consent to evidential tests for alcohol or other drug content of their blood,
     breath, and/or urine as a condition to accepting installation-driving privileges. This consent
     applies when lawfully detained, apprehended, or cited for any impaired/intoxicated driving
     offense committed while driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle, regardless of the
     intoxicated driving incident. Failure to take or complete a lawfully requested chemical test
     will result in immediate suspension/revocation of driving privileges.
     2.4.2. The primary evidential test conducted on this installation is the breath test in either
     portable or non-portable form factor. In cases of instrument malfunctions, blood will be the
     alternate means of testing. Implied consent applies equally on and off the installation. 374
     SFS personnel will advise personnel suspected of driving under the influence (DUI) of the
     implied consent policy as follows:

Figure 2.1. Sample Consent Policy
“I request that you submit to a test of your (blood) (breath) (urine) for the purpose of determining
the presence of (alcohol) (drugs). You are advised that refusal to submit to or complete this test
will result in revocation of your driving privileges for one year. In addition, if you are found to
have been driving under the influence, or while under the influence of any other drug (including
alcohol) to the degree rendering you incapable of safe vehicle operation, your driving privileges
will be revoked an additional year to run consecutively for a total of two years. Further, under
the implied consent policy you have no right to consult with an attorney before deciding to
submit to or refuse a test of your (blood) (breath) (urine).”

2.5. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. As a condition of accepting installation
driving privileges, drivers must consent to the installation vehicle impoundment policy.
Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) registration forms or policy will contain or have appended to
them a certificate with the following statement: “I am aware that Yokota ABI 31-116, Yokota
Air Base Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, and the installation traffic code provide for the
removal and temporary impoundment of POVs parked illegally for unreasonable periods,
YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013                                                                          9


interfering with military operations, creating a safety hazard, disabled by incident, left
unattended in a restricted or controlled area, or abandoned. I agree to reimburse any agency or
contractor for the cost of towing, storing and disposing of my motor vehicle if it is lawfully
removed and impounded."
2.6. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges.
   2.6.1. All suspension and/or revocations must be coordinated with the 374 SFS Reports and
   Analysis (374 SFS/S5R). SOFA personnel whose driving privileges are suspended or
   revoked will surrender their USFJ Form 4EJ to 374 SFS/S5R and their AF Form 2293 to
   their unit vehicle NCO. Non-SOFA personnel whose driving privileges are suspended or
   revoked will surrender their 374 AW Form 1, 374 AW Form 68EJ or Defense Biometric
   Identification System (DBIDS) Vehicle Pass. During the period of suspension or revocation,
   all non-GOV licenses are kept at 374 SFS/S5R.
       2.6.1.1. Personnel whose driving privileges are suspended or revoked will not operate
       any vehicle, both POV or GOV unless Limited Driving Privileges have been received.
   2.6.2. Unit commanders have been delegated the right to suspend the driving privileges of
   military personnel (not military dependents) with high-risk tendencies for up to a period of
   180 days. The high-risk tendencies must be tied to the operation of a motor vehicle or
   motorcycle. The unit commander must make suspensions in writing. The written suspension
   must include the reason for the suspension, the length of the suspension and whether or not
   the suspension applies to only on or off-base driving or both. The unit commander and
   military member will sign the written suspension and forward to WTRO through 374
   SFS/S5R for review. At the time of suspension, the military member will deliver their
   driver’s license to the unit commander until the suspension has lapsed or has been
   terminated. The unit commander may reinstate the driving privileges of the member before
   the end of the suspension if circumstances warrant reinstatement. Upon completion of the
   180 days, the unit commander will terminate the suspension or may forward a
   recommendation to WTRO for license revocation.
2.6.3. Appeals may be submitted by the military member during the period of suspension to the
WTRO. Upon receipt of the appeal, the WTRO may rescind the suspension mandated by the
unit commander, if warranted.
   2.6.4. Drivers of vehicles cited for Talking/Texting on a Cell Phone or Electronic Device or
   not wearing required motorcycle personal protective equipment will be issued a suspension
   letter along with a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket. The suspension letter
   suspends the driver's on-base driving privileges effective at 0001L on the second duty day
   following the citation. The suspension affects both on-base and off-base driving privileges
   for those drivers who possess a USFJ Form 4EJ. The driver has 1 duty day following the
   infraction to contact 374 SFS/S5R to request to rebut the citation, if so desired. In the event a
   rebuttal is requested, the suspension will not take effect until the first duty day following a
   decision on the rebuttal, if the result of the rebuttal is adverse to the driver. The length of the
   suspension is IAW Table 2.1. and Table 2.2.
 10                                                            YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013

   2.6.5. The length of the suspension for failure to wear motorcycle personal protective
   equipment is IAW the following table. This suspension applies against the driver for
   violations by the driver and any passenger. Suspension applies only to motorcycle driving
   privileges:

Table 2.2. Length of the Suspension for Failure to Wear Motorcycle Personal Protective
Equipment
 Number of Offense                                   Period of Suspension
 1st Offense                                         15 days
 2nd Offense within a 12-month period                1 month
 3rd Offense within an 18-month period               1 year

   2.6.6. A revocation for the purpose of this instruction is a minimum of 6 months.
   2.6.7. Per USFJI 31-205, suspension or revocation of driving privileges applies on a USFJ
   installation, and is applicable as outlined below. This suspension and/or restriction also
   applies to mopeds, motorcycles, or any other motorized vehicle while in effect.
       2.6.7.1. Personnel whose USFJ Form 4EJ or AF Form 2293 license is suspended are not
       authorized to operate any vehicle on the installation unless Limited Driving Privileges
       were awarded, regardless of whether they possess an international driver's license.
       Personnel whose sole authority to drive in Japan is derived from the possession of the
       USFJ Form 4EJ or AF Form 2293, are prohibited from driving any vehicle in Japan, on
       or off the installation, for the duration of a suspension or revocation. Personnel who also
       possess an international driver's license are prohibited from driving a "Y" plated vehicle
       for the duration of a suspension or revocation.
   2.6.8. Suspension or revocation applies both on and off the installation for US Forces
   personnel.
   2.6.9. Personnel under 20 years of age, regardless of their military component or DoD
   affiliation, observed or determined to have consumed an alcoholic beverage and then
   operated or were in physical control of a vehicle, i.e., to include the capability or capacity to
   maneuver controls, regardless of their blood alcohol content (BAC) or breath alcohol content
   (BrAC), will have their driving privileges suspended or revoked. The presence of the odor of
   alcohol is sufficient to process underage individuals under this provision.
   2.6.10. 374 SFS will confiscate driver’s permits on the spot from individuals who have been
   apprehended or detained when evidence indicates that the individual has been driving while
YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013                                                                      11


   impaired (DWI), DUI, drinking and driving while under age, refused to acknowledge the
   implied consent policy, or reckless driving. An AF Form 52, Evidence Tag, will be
   accomplished on all confiscated items.
   2.6.11. When the WTRO suspends or revokes an individual, they will report to 374 SFS/S5R
   within 14 calendar days to acknowledge the WTRO’s decision. Failing to acknowledge
   within 14 days will result in the suspension going into effect automatically and the member
   will forfeit the option for an administrative hearing.
       2.6.11.1. If the member is caught driving on suspension or revocation after it is in effect,
       the member will receive an automatic revocation of 2 years added onto the original
       disposition (AFI 31-218(I), paragraph 2-12a).
   2.6.11.2. Submit appeals and requests for reconsideration of suspension and revocation
   offenses in writing to 374 SFS/S5R.
   2.6.11.3. If a hearing is not requested, suspension and/or revocation not outlined in
   paragraphs 2.5.1.3. and 2.5.2.1. of AFMAN 31-116 will take effect upon acknowledgment of
   receipt or the next day.
   2.6.12. If the suspension or revocation was based on an accumulation of 12 traffic points
   within 12 consecutive months, or 18 traffic points within 24 consecutive months, the
   reinstatement letter will also include verification of completion of Course V, Driver
   Improvement Course, conducted by the 374 AW Safety Office (374 AW/SE). Completion of
   Course V, Driver Improvement Course, is not required when the initial suspension or
   revocation was for an alcohol related offense or for non-moving (parking) violations. Note:
   Civilians are encouraged to attend, but not required.
       2.6.12.1. If the individual fails to complete required courses, their suspension or
       revocation of installation driving privileges will be extended until completion. The
       responsibility for ensuring the individual has completed all required courses falls directly
       on the individual, unit commander, first sergeant, or agency chief. The reinstatement
       letter will include verification of completion of the applicable course.
2.7. Reciprocal Procedures. The installation commander or designee will honor reciprocal
suspensions/revocations issued by other installation commanders, regardless of service
component affiliation, when formally requested. Revocations remain in effect during
reassignment unless the issuing authority terminates the revocation before reassignment.
Anyone with suspended or revoked privileges may petition for partial or limited driving
privileges as outlined in this instruction.
2.8. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs. After coordination with the SJA, unit commanders
will direct drug and/or alcohol testing within 24 hours of suspected alcohol related motor
vehicle/traffic incidents or misconduct, episodes of aberrant or bizarre behavior or where there is
reasonable suspicion of drug use and the member refuses to provide consent for testing.
Commanders will ensure Blood Alcohol Tests (BAT) are taken as soon after the incident as
possible to determine the level and intensity of alcohol involvement. All military personnel
involved in any intoxicated (drug or alcohol) motor vehicle incident will be referred to the
ADAPT program or appropriate alcohol abuse program for their specific military branch for
evaluation. Note: Civilians are encouraged to attend, but not required.

2.9. Restoration of Driving Privileges on Acquittal. When an official report or finding
determines lack of guilt (not guilty) or when charges are dismissed or reduced to an offense not
amounting to impaired driving, the suspension of driving privileges will be vacated. The
following are exceptions to the rule, and suspensions will continue to be enforced when:
   2.9.1. The preliminary suspension was based on the refusal to take a BAC test.
   2.9.2. The preliminary suspension resulted from a valid BAC test (unless disposition of the
   charges was based on the invalidity of the BAC test). In the case of a valid BAC test, the
   suspension will continue, pending the completion of a hearing. In such instances, the
   member will be notified in writing that the suspension will continue and of the opportunity to
   request a hearing within 14 calendar days.
   2.9.3. The member was driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under a
   preliminary suspension or revocation.
   2.9.4. An administrative determination has been made by the State or Host Nation licensing
   authority to suspend or revoke driving privileges.
   2.9.5. The member has failed to complete a formally directed substance abuse or driver’s
   training program.
2.10. Restricted Driving Privileges or Probation:
   2.10.1. The installation commander or designee may authorize partial or restricted driving
   privileges to those whose authority to drive on military installations was suspended or
   revoked by a military service authority.
   2.10.2. All requests for limited driving privileges must be endorsed by the unit commander
   or first sergeant and processed through 374 SFS/S5R for the WTRO’s approval or
   disapproval. Personnel must show documented proof they are scheduled for the appropriate
   program outlined in paragraph 2.10.8. Failure to attend will warrant a loss of driving
   privileges, retroactive to the date of the offense.
   2.10.3. The requestor will identify the vehicle to be driven, the location, and occasion in
   which the vehicle can be driven. The requestor will specify driving privileges are mission
   essential or are necessary to prevent family hardship. The following facilities are considered
   mission essential: the base hospital (for emergencies), the base gas station, and work. A copy
   of the restricted driving letter will be kept in the vehicle at all times (see Attachment 3).
   2.10.4. When the driving privileges of an individual have been revoked for one year or
   longer, all vehicles registered to that individual will be deregistered within 10 workdays.
   Deregistration must be accomplished at the 374 SFS Pass and Registration (374 SFS/S5P),
   Bldg 993. This does not apply to unit commander directed suspensions. The following
   exceptions will be made:
       2.10.4.1. When the owner has been granted limited driving privileges, the vehicle need
       not be deregistered; however, they must, prior to operating any POV, report to 374
       SFS/S5P for a temporary pass IAW the limited driving privileges letter.
       2.10.4.2. In cases where the spouse or family members are authorized to drive, the
       vehicle need not be deregistered.
YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013                                                                        13

   2.10.6. Personnel whose license is suspended for 6 months or less must, within 14 workdays
   after receipt of notification of suspension or revocation of driving privileges, or after the
   hearing with the WTRO, contact the 374 SFS/S5P section to surrender their USFJ Form 15
   (base decal) or receive their additional driving restrictions decal for their vehicle(s).
   2.10.7. Personnel granted POV limited-driving privileges will have their license stamped
   “Limited” by 374 SFS/S5R. Upon completion of the suspension they will have their
   suspension letter stamped by 374 SFS/S5R, who in-turn will send the applicant to 374
   SFS/S5P for issuance of a new USFJ Form 4EJ. For personnel granted limited or regular
   GOV driving privileges, the reinstatement letter is submitted to the 374th Logistics
   Readiness Squadron Vehicle Operations (374 LRS/LGRO) for GOV permit re-issue.
   2.10.8. All requests for full reinstatement of driving privileges must be endorsed by the
   respective unit commander or first sergeant and processed through 374 SFS/S5R.
   Reinstatement will only be approved upon successful completion of Course V, Driver
   Improvement Course, through the 374 AW/SE or proof of completion of substance abuse
   program through 374 MDG (except for JCI and/or liability insurance offenses which only
   requires a letter for reinstatement from their unit commander or first sergeant).
   2.10.9. If limited privileges are approved and individuals are subsequently found at fault in a
   major vehicle accident, operating a vehicle outside of the limited restriction, or are cited for a
   moving violation, they will lose their restricted driving privileges. The original suspension
   or revocation will be reinstated, retroactive from the date of the initial offense.
   2.10.10. Personnel whose driving privileges are under suspension or revocation by state,
   federal, or Japanese licensing authorities are ineligible for local driving privileges.
   2.10.11. Revocations for test refusals to complete a breath alcohol test shall remain.

   2.12.1. IAW AFMAN 31-201, Volume 7, Security Forces Administration and Reports
   (sfar/s5r), 374 SFS/S5R will notify the state licensing agency (a copy of their stateside
   drivers license will be included in their file) of personnel whose installation driving
   privileges are suspended or revoked for 1-year or more following final adjudication of an
   intoxicated driving offense or upon refusal to submit to a lawful BAC/BrAC test. The
   following is applicable:
       2.12.1.1. When a state revokes the violator’s driving privileges on a reciprocal basis,

  3.1.3. A family unit is authorized to own one 4-wheel and one 2-wheel vehicle per adult
  licensed driver (18 years of age and older); however, a family unit may not own more than
  two 4-wheel and two 2-wheel vehicles. 374 MSG Commander or designee is the approval
  authority for waivers to these limits. Once approved, individuals will bring their
  memorandum to 374 SFS/S5P during registration. 374 SFS/S5P will maintain the approval
  letter on file until it is no longer valid. Waivers will be considered on a case-by-case basis
  for exceptional reasons only. Additionally, waivers may be granted for classic or antique
  vehicles.
     3.1.3.1. If a vehicle owner requires a replacement vehicle and will exceed their
     authorization for a limited period of time, a 60-day waiver may be granted by 374
     SFS/S5P. This waiver is non-transferable and will not be extended. Prior to the end of

     permit to 374 SFS/S5P and complete a 60-day waiver request letter. Only one excess
     vehicle per family is authorized during the 60-day waiver period. USFJ Form 15A or
     USFJ Form 15B will be removed from the vehicle to be sold and a temporary permit will
     be issued.
  3.1.4. Special purpose vehicles such as dirt bikes, racing motorcycles, dune buggies,
  motorized go-carts, etc., will be registered with 374 SFS/S5P for local control purposes
  within 10 days of taking possession of the vehicle. These vehicles will be issued a 374 AW
  Form 12, registered in DBIDS, and given a base decal indicating the vehicle was properly
  registered. Special purpose vehicles are only authorized to be operated at an approved
  location for the particular vehicle and will not be operated on Yokota AB or public roadways.
  Special purpose vehicles are not required to be insured and operators are not required to be
  licensed due to the fact that the vehicles are not to be driven on regular roadways. These
  vehicles may be driven only in special areas designed for the vehicle’s purpose. However,
  proper instruction and personal insurance is strongly recommended.
  3.1.5. For issuance of 374 AW Form 1 the following documentation is needed:
     3.1.5.1. Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS) pass or card.
     3.1.5.2. Current state driver's license.
     3.1.5.3. Proof of JCI and current inspection.
     3.1.5.4. Proof of liability insurance (not less than 30,000,000 yen for bodily injury and
     3,000,000 yen for property damage).
     3.1.5.5. The 374 AW Form 1 will be displayed in the lower right-hand corner of the
     windshield while the vehicle is on 374 AW installations.
         3.1.5.5.1. The expiration date on the 374 AW Forms 1 will coincide with the driver's
         gate pass or vehicle insurance, whichever is earlier.

     3.1.5.6. 374 AW Form 18, Installation Access Card, and 374 AW Form 12 are used by
     374 SFS/S5P for temporary registration. Both forms are self-explanatory.
     3.1.5.7. 374 AW Form 7, Motor Vehicle Inspection Report (PA), will be utilized for
     vehicle inspections. An Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) or Forces
     Support Squdron (FSS) vehicle inspection supervisor will date the 374 AW Form 7 to
     coincide with the Japanese Inspection Certificate's expiration date. An AAFES or FSS
     Vehicle Inspection Supervisor will stamp the form using the inspection passed stamp,
     when applicable, and paid stamp reflecting the actual inspection date.
         3.1.5.7.1. The Vehicle Inspection Supervisor will conduct vehicle inspections
         following guidelines outlined in Attachment 7.
         3.1.5.7.2. Vehicle inspections are conducted prior to and within 30 days of the
         Japanese Inspection Certificate's expiration date. For example, if a Japanese
         Inspection Certificate expires 10 February, then the vehicle will require an inspection
         not earlier than 11 January, but prior to 10 February. Vehicle owners are required to
         have a current inspection upon initial registration and newly purchased vehicles that
         are going through initial registration.
         3.1.5.7.3. Two-wheeled motor vehicle safety inspections will cover the vehicle and
         helmet, and will be conducted by properly appointed inspectors and recorded on 374
         AW Form 48, Safety Inspection of Two-Wheeled Motor Vehicles.
         3.1.5.7.4. Owners and/or employees of local licensed automobile dealerships may
         transport POVs purchased by SOFA personnel to the AAFES or FSS Auto Hobby
         Center garage for the purpose of obtaining a vehicle inspection. They may purchase
         the materials, products and service required to pass the base inspection provided
         AAFES or FSS Auto Hobby Center vehicle maintenance personnel perform the work.
         Owners and/or managers of local automobile dealerships must request permission in
         writing from the AAFES or FSS Auto Hobby Center General Manager to obtain this
         service. Furthermore, they must provide a copy of the approved permission to the
         AAFES or FSS Auto Hobby Center Garage Manager with a listing of personnel who
         may perform this for SOFA personnel. Purchases made over-the-counter are not
         authorized unless the individual has a valid DoD identification card granting this
         privilege. Violation of this instruction may result in the withdrawal of the
         authorization to obtain this service.
     3.1.5.8. USFJ Forms 15A or 15B must be removed from vehicles on termination or
     transfer of ownership.
     3.1.5.9. Motorist with a valid need for a handicapped decal must provide 374 SFS/S5P
     with a current letter from a medical care provider outlining the need and duration for
     handicapped access.
  3.1.6. Owners are prohibited from parking unregistered, wrecked, or inoperative motor
  vehicles at any location other than the FSS Auto Hobby Center, Base Exchange (BX) Garage
  (only with an AAFES work contract) or off-base vehicle maintenance shops. Wrecked
  vehicles cannot be stored at the AAFES garage without approval from garage personnel.
  Inoperative vehicles may remain at these locations up to 90 days (180 days with an extension
18                                                         YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013

  maintenance as prescribed in this supplement.
     3.1.6.1. Major vehicle maintenance performed on base will be accomplished only at the
     FSS Auto Hobby Center or BX Garage. Owners will report to 374 SFS/S5P with an
     authorization letter from the FSS Auto Hobby Center or BX Garage to deregister their
     vehicle for major maintenance. Once deregistered, JCI, liability insurance, or the base
     inspection may be allowed to lapse. The vehicle will meet all operational requirements
     prior to being reregistered.
     3.1.6.2. The initial deregistration document will be issued for 90 days. If after this period
     the vehicle is still inoperative, a 90-day extension may be granted, only after proof of
     attempts to fix the vehicle is presented to 374 SFS/S5P (e.g., BX Garage or FSS Auto
     Hobby Center order receipts). Owners must remove from the installation, at their
     expense, any vehicle not repaired and properly registered after the 180-day period.
  3.1.7. The DD Form 2220, DoD Registered Vehicle, is not used at Yokota AB. Military and

  vehicles and USFJ Form 15B for all 2-wheel vehicles IAW USFJI 31-205.
  3.1.8. Registered owners of POVs are responsible for ensuring all insurance requirements
  are met per USFJI 31-205. If an individual fails to maintain JCI or liability insurance on his
  or her POV, the individual may lose driving privileges consistent with the parameters set
  forth in Table 5.1 Vehicle registration and safety procedures, requirements and forms will
  be per USFJI 31-205. Vehicles will be kept in inspection order at all times. Vehicles cited
  for safety defects will have 72 hours to correct the defect. The owner will report to the Base
  Defense Operations Center (BDOC) at building 555 or 374 SFS/S5R at building 305 with the
  vehicle to indicate it has been repaired.
  3.1.9. The 374 AW Form 12 will be used in place of the AF Form 533, Certificate of
  Compliance - Private Motor Vehicle Registration.
  3.1.10. Anyone who has registered a vehicle will not depart Japan pursuant to permanent
  change of station (PCS) orders, retirement, separation, or otherwise permanently leave
  without previously selling, transferring, or deregistering POVs, or lawfully providing a
  special POA to sell the vehicle. These personnel are authorized to use a POA to dispose of
  their POVs for a period of 90-days after the effective date of their PCS, retirement, or

                                           Chapter 4

                            TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES

4.1. Traffic Code. These provisions apply to all persons who operate motor vehicles and
bicycles and all pedestrians on Yokota AB or any area under the control and jurisdiction of the
installation commander (374 AW/CC). The 374 SFS performs the mission of directing,
controlling and enforcing traffic rules and ensuring vehicles, materials and personnel flow safely
and efficiently over roadways under Air Force control.
   4.1.1. On-scene 374 SFS personnel directing traffic or other personnel properly trained by
   374 SFS (to include school crossing guards) have precedence over written regulations and
   traffic signs. In the absence of 374 SFS or other authorized human control device, the
   following are the rules of the roadways.
   4.1.2. 374 SFS controls the speed of traffic on the installation by means of observation, radar
   units, or pacing.
       4.1.2.1. Personnel selected as operators of speed measuring devices will meet training
       and certification requirements prescribed by the State or SOFA prior to being authorized
       to use the device. 374 SFS/S3T provides training on the use of speed measuring devices
       and documents training in members training records.
   4.1.3. Heavy, oversized or special equipment: If heavy equipment (e.g., front end loaders,
   cranes, M-series) vehicles have lights and turn signals, the vehicle does not have to be
   escorted unless the vehicle is wider than one lane of traffic or interferes with the normal flow
   of traffic. The sponsoring agency will coordinate with 374 SFS prior to movement to help
   determine the best route and time to conduct the escort. The sponsoring agency or equipment
   operators will provide personnel necessary to facilitate traffic control.
4.2. Traffic Control Devices. Vehicle operators will obey all standard traffic signs and road
markings and, in addition, will observe the following rules:
   4.2.1. Red Light. Come to a complete stop and wait for the light to change. Left turn on
   red is only authorized at designated locations indicated by a blue left arrow
   permanently affixed to the traffic signal.
   4.2.2. Yellow Light. Stop before entering the intersection if such a stop can be made safely.
   4.2.3. Green Light. Proceed through the intersection at a safe speed.
   4.2.4. Green Arrow Light. Only traffic in the direction indicated may proceed.
   4.2.5. Flashing Red Light. Come to a complete stop and ensure traffic is clear before
   entering the intersection.
   4.2.6. Flashing Yellow Light. Slow to a safe speed and yield right-of-way to traffic.
   4.2.7. Stop Sign. Come to a complete stop and yield right-of-way to all traffic before
   entering the intersection.
   4.2.8. Yield Sign. Slow down to a safe speed and yield right-of-way, stopping if necessary
   for vehicles approaching from other directions before entering the intersection.
YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013                                                                     21


   4.2.9. Intersections with traffic lights will become four-way-stop intersections whenever a
   power outage or malfunction occurs.
   4.2.10. Operators will not drive through parking lots or non-street areas to circumvent traffic
   control devices.
   4.2.11. Each operator of a motor vehicle or bicycle must be knowledgeable of all traffic
   control devices and signs. A claim of ignorance that results in an accident is not a defense.
   All traffic control devices will be handled as follows:
      4.2.11.1. Do not place, display, or remove reserved parking, special parking, no-parking,
      no-entry, detour, or other traffic regulating signs without permission from the 374 AW
      Traffic Safety Working Group, chaired by 374 MSG/DD, facilitated by the 374th Civil
      Engineer Squadron Maintenance Engineering (374 CES/CEOE) and with members from
      374 AW/SE, 374 SFS, 374 CES and 374 LRS. All temporary parking signs must be
      approved by the 374 SFS Police Services Section and coordinated through 374 AW
      Ground Safety (374 AW/SEG).
      4.2.11.2. Do not alter, twist remove, or interfere with the effective operation of any
      official traffic control device without lawful authority.
   4.2.12. There are traffic lights at both the east and west sides of the north and south
   overruns. All drivers must comply with the following rules:
      4.2.12.1. When the yellow light is on, proceed cautiously while watching for aircraft
      taking off or landing. When aircraft are observed, either immediately clear the overrun or
      do not proceed onto it.
      4.2.12.2. When the light is red and the bell is sounding, come to a complete stop at the
      light and do not proceed until the runway is clear and the light has returned to yellow.
      4.2.12.3. If at any time the lights or bell are not functioning, do not proceed across the
      overruns; report the situation to the 374th Operations Support Squadron Airfield
      Management Operations (AM Ops) (374 OSS/OSAM) or the Control Tower. 374
      OSS/OSAM will notify 374 SFS when the overrun lights malfunction. 374 SFS will
      perform temporary traffic control or close access to the overrun, until the lights are
      repaired. 374 CES will initiate an emergency work order to repair the lights or bell.
4.3. Safety Standards. The minimum safety standards for vehicle operations on Yokota AB
roadways are:
   4.3.1. All military service members, reserve component members on active federal service
   and all civilian personnel (family members, guests and visitors) driving or riding in GOV or
   POV whether on or off the installation must wear the manufacturer’s primary restraint
   system (seat belts), including those vehicles equipped with air bags. Vehicle operators will
   ensure seatbelts are installed and in use whenever a vehicle is being operated on the roadway,
   prior to putting the vehicle into motion. Vehicle seats without manufacturer installed
   seatbelts will not be used to transport passengers. When a child is 4 years of age or younger
   or the weight of the child does not exceed 45 pounds, her or she must be in a US Department
   of Transportation (DoT) approved infant and/or child restraint device, properly affixed to the
   seat.
22                                                         YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013


     4.3.1.1. Individuals will not operate or ride in seats where occupant restraints have been
     removed or rendered inoperative.
     4.3.1.2. Children 11 years of age or younger, or shorter than 150 centimeters (4 feet, 11
     inches), are required to sit in the back seat using restraint equipment suitable for the child
     and approved by DOT.
  4.3.2. Use headlights and reduce speed, as appropriate, while operating on roadways during
  periods of reduced visibility (twilight, darkness and inclement weather, or whenever roadway
  conditions limit visibility to less than 500 feet). GOV and POV operators will use headlights
  anytime the windshield wipers are used. Do not use high beams when there is oncoming
  traffic.
  4.3.3. Dim headlights to parking lights when entering the installation gates or approaching
  manned entry control points (ECP) after dark.
  4.3.4. Vehicle and bicycle operators will not wear headphones, earphones, or portable
  listening devices (walk-man, MP3, or iPod, etc.) type headsets. Exception: Fire and
  ambulance crews are authorized to use tactical closed voice communication (CVC) systems
  for M-series vehicles. Microphone and ear speaker systems used by a motorcycle operator
  and passengers are also authorized.
  4.3.5. Vehicles will not be operated with the doors opened, removed, or with any type of
  obstruction impairing the operator’s vision. Exception: GOVs with safety nets or M-series
  vehicles. GOV or M-series vehicle operators and passengers must use seatbelts when
  installed.
  4.3.6. AFI 91-207, The US Air Force Traffic Safety Program, restricts the number of people
  in GOVs to the designed seating capacity. This includes sedans, station wagons, buses,
  trucks and cargo vans with passenger seats. When exigent circumstances or contingency
  requirements exceed availability of such vehicles, commanders, through the risk management
  decision process, will determine the appropriate mode of transportation or operating
  procedures for such existing vehicles. Persons transported in the bed of a truck will be seated
  in the cargo area. Passengers will not ride on top of cargo or wheel wells or extend any part
  of their body outside the truck bed or rest against the tailgate.
  4.3.7. Passengers will not ride on special equipment or aircraft towing vehicles unless sitting
  on a seat designed as a part of the vehicle equipment.
  4.3.8. Vehicles will not be stopped to discharge passengers within an intersection, roadway,
  or other area not specifically designated for drop-off or parking.
  4.3.9. M-series vehicles are not authorized in any housing area, unless on official business.
  4.3.10. Vehicle owners are solely responsible for ensuring only authorized and licensed
  personnel operate their vehicles. Vehicle owners and/or operators will not allow a person
  under the influence of alcohol or intoxicating drugs to operate a vehicle under their control.
     4.3.10.1. Vehicle owners will be held responsible if they loan their vehicle and it is cited
     for not complying with registration, tax, or insurance requirements. The citation will be
     transferred to the owner not the operator.
YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013                                                                      23


  4.3.11. Vehicle modification is a physical change that alters the original manufacture’s
  design. Illegal vehicle modification is a physical change that is not documented on the
  Japanese title. USFJ personnel are prohibited from physically modifying, or altering their
  vehicle, which changes the original manufacturer’s design (i.e., serial number, tires, rims,
  suspension, steering wheel, timing of signal flashers, etc.) after completing the Government
  of Japan (GOJ) vehicle inspection.
     4.3.11.1. Defective, non-compliant, or illegally modified vehicles: It is unlawful for any
     person to drive or move, or for the owner to cause or knowingly permit to be driven or
     moved, on any roadway, any vehicle or combination of vehicles which is in such an
     unsafe condition as to endanger any person, or which does not contain those parts, or is
     not at all times equipped with such lamps, and other equipment in proper condition, and
     adjustment, or which is equipped in any manner in violation of this instruction.
     4.3.11.2. Vehicle owners or operators with defective, noncompliant, or illegally modified
     vehicles will be issued a DD Form 1408 and instructed to correct the violation within 72
     hours. Individuals will also be instructed to maintain a copy of the violation with the
     vehicle until the correction is made, and will present the citation to the 374 SFS member
     if subsequently stopped for the same violation within the 72 hour period. Unit
     commanders, first sergeants, or agency chiefs are responsible for ensuring owners correct
     defective, non-complaint, or illegally modified vehicles. Anyone who cannot comply
     within 72 hours must have a letter from his or her first sergeant or agency chief stating
     they have given an extension to the violator to correct the violation, and the estimated
     completion date. 374 SFS personnel will not issue additional citations for the same
     vehicle defect if the operator presents a previous citation and is still within their 72 hours
     or has a valid extension letter from their unit first sergeant or agency chief in addition to
     the original citation.
  4.3.12. Operation of a motor vehicle is prohibited if either the front or rear GOJ license
  plates are missing or if the Japanese seal (rear license plate) is broken, or is illegible. The
  owner must obtain temporary license plates until new ones are obtained to operate the
  vehicle.
     4.3.12.1. License plates will be mounted so that they are not obscured, covered or tilted.
     An object attached to or over the motor vehicle’s license plate is prohibited. Infrared
     License Plate covers are illegal.

  4.18.1. Pedestrian traffic. Joggers and walkers are considered to be pedestrians. Pedestrians
  share certain rights and duties as road users and are subject to certain traffic controls, signs
  and devices, which they must comply with. Pedestrians who violate this instruction may be
  issued a DD Form 1408. Citations for “Jay-Walking” issued to military members and US
  civilian or host nation employee violators will be forwarded to their unit commander or
  agency chief for action. Citations for civilians and dependents will be forwarded to the
  sponsor’s unit commander or agency chief for action. The following rules apply to
  pedestrians:
     4.18.1.1. Children will not play in streets or leave toys in the street, driveways, or
     sidewalks.
     4.18.1.2. Pedestrians will have the right-of-way on sidewalks.
     4.18.1.3. Use designated pedestrian crossings to cross roadways. Do not leave the curb
     and assume the right-of-way over traffic when such traffic is so close it would create a
     potential hazard.
     4.18.1.3.1. When crosswalks are available, pedestrians will cross the roadway only at
     the crosswalk. When no pedestrian crosswalk is available, yield to traffic and do not
     cross until traffic has passed or comes to a complete stop and the driver directs you to
     cross.
         4.18.1.3.2. Cross all roadways in the most expeditious and safe manner. Pedestrians
         will not linger in the roadways or in a designated crosswalk when crossing the street.
     4.18.1.4. Pedestrians crossing at unmarked intersections with traffic lights will not
     interfere with the smooth flow of traffic.
     4.18.1.5. When sidewalks are not available, pedestrians will walk on the outermost edge
     of the road facing the flow of traffic and in a single file.
     4.18.1.6. Pedestrians will not impede traffic through personal carelessness or with any
     type of obstruction.
     4.18.1.7. Hitchhiking on base is prohibited.
     4.18.1.8. Pedestrians will yield to all responding emergency vehicles.
     4.18.1.9. Joggers exercising on the roadways will wear reflective material on their upper
     body from official sunset to sunrise and during conditions of reduced visibility. The
     reflective material may be a reflective belt, reflective vest, or highly reflective clothing.
     4.18.1.10. Joggers will run on the outermost edge of the roadway and not interfere with
     the flow of traffic. When a sidewalk is present, joggers and runners will use the
     sidewalk, but not interfere with pedestrian traffic.
     4.18.1.11. Joggers will not wear “walk-man” type headsets or earmuffs which preclude
     hearing traffic while running on roadways to include traversing intersections. This
     restriction does not apply to designated jogging paths.
     4.18.1.12. Joggers and pedestrians are not permitted on the North and the South overrun.
     Joggers and pedestrians will use the provided paths when crossing the North and the
     South overrun areas.

     4.18.1.13. Joggers will run facing on-coming traffic and remain off of the road surface.
     Except where designated to the contrary, yield the right-of-way to all vehicle and bicycle
     traffic.
  4.18.2. Do not consume alcohol or carry open containers of alcohol while in public, except
  where authorized by 374 AW/CC according to AFI 34-219, Alcoholic Beverage Program,
  and AFI 34-219_374 AWSUP, Alcoholic Beverage Program. When under the influence of
  alcohol or drugs, do not walk in the roadway. Use a sidewalk where available or an open
  area farthest away from the roadway.

               DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. 374 SFS/S5R oversees the maintenance of installation driving records
and the integrity of the traffic point system. The Security Forces Management Information
System (SFMIS) is used to record vehicle traffic accidents, moving and parking violations,
suspension or revocation actions and traffic point assessments involving military and DoD
civilian personnel, their family members and other personnel operating motor vehicles on a
military installation.
5.2. Traffic Point System.
   5.2.1. The traffic point system supplements AFMAN 31-116 and provides a uniform
   administrative device to impartially judge driving performance. This system is not a
   disciplinary measure or a substitute for punitive action and does not interfere with the
   installation commander's prerogative to issue, suspend, revoke, deny or reinstate installation-
   driving privileges IAW AFMAN 31-116 and USFJI 31-205.

they have obtained it.
Note 4: Points will not be assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions except for implied
consent violations and violations determined by the WTRO as unsafe acts.
Note 5: Vehicle Operators will not be assessed for the violation unless they are the owner/sponsor of

YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013                                                                                 49


 Note 6: When an AF Form 3545 will also be accomplished. Revocation of driving privileges for one
 year will be considered by the commander. Example: If children or animals were left in dangerous
 conditions in vehicle, i.e., in hot weather where the interior temperatures may reach dangerous levels,
 keys left accessible to children or where conditions are deemed hazardous by a reasonable person.
 Note 7: Military personnel married to military personnel have the option to register vehicles in their
 own name. Registration requirements and number of authorized vehicles allowed will be met. Refer to
 USFJI 31-205 for registration requirements. The registered owner of a vehicle is responsible to maintain
 JCI, Road Tax, and Liability insurance on the vehicle at all times.

   5.2.2. If a suspension or revocation is warranted, 374 SFS/S5R will process the package and
   submit it to the WTRO. Upon final determination by the WTRO, the individual is assessed
   points and his or her driving privileges will be suspended or revoked.
   5.2.3. Unit commanders will be notified in writing when an individual accumulates six or
   more traffic points in a 6-month period.
   5.2.4. Upon receipt of AF Form 1313, Driver Record, or SFMIS product on a person newly
   assigned to the installation, 374 SFS/S5R will forward the record to the individual’s unit
   commander for review. This review helps commanders identify individuals in need of driver
   improvement, counseling, or remedial driver’s training. Immediately following this review,
   destroy the record according to AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program. Do not file the record in
   the individual’s personnel information file.
5.3. Rebuttal of Traffic Citations.
   5.3.1. When a violator receives a ticket and feels the ticket was unjustly issued, the violator
   can rebut the ticket. The violator has 5 duty days to notify 374 SFS/S5R that they want to
   rebut the ticket. If the violator does not notify 374 SFS/S5R within that timeframe, it will be
   assumed the violator does not wish to rebut. The ticket will be closed and processed for
   points and/or suspension.
        5.3.1.1. If the violator notifies 374 SFS/S5R within 5 duty days their desire to rebut, the
        individual will be given 14 days to provide a memorandum articulating his or her position
        to the Defense Force Commander (DFC) through 374 SFS/S5R. The letter must be
        endorsed by his or her commander (eg. Concur/Non-concur). A completed package will
        be forwarded to the WTRO for final decision and the violator will be notified of the
        results.
        5.3.1.2. Rebuttals may not be accepted based on the following circumstances:
            5.3.1.2.1. Correctable and administrative errors on the violation.
            5.3.1.2.2. Similar uncited violations of others.
        5.3.1.3. If the 374 SFS/S5 concludes the ticket is valid, the ticket will be forwarded to
        the 374 MSG/CD with a recommendation on the validity of the citation.
        5.3.1.4. 374 MSG/CD will review the rebuttal package along with recommendations and
        makes the final determination on the validity of the action.

5.4. Point System Application.
   5.4.1. The point system applies to military personnel, dependents, civilian employees, and
   all other individuals subject to AFMAN 31-116 operating POVs on or off the installation.
   5.4.2. The use of the point system and procedures prescribed herein are mandatory and will
   be handled IAW AFMAN 31-116.
   5.4.3. The assessment of points for off-base infractions not listed in Table 5.1 of this
   instruction, AFI 31-218(I), or AFMAN 31-116 will be coordinated with the 374 SFS Liaison
   office for action.
5.5. Point System Procedures.
   5.5.1. Security Forces will record traffic violations and assess points IAW this instruction as
   follows:
      5.5.1.1. An offense that results in an apprehension or is considered reckless driving will
      have an AF Form 3545, Incident Report, and/or supporting documents prepared. If the
      incident is an alcohol or drug related driving offense and an observed traffic violation
      was the initial reason for contact, a DD Form 1408 will also be submitted.
          5.5.1.1.1. Points will be assessed IAW Table 5.1 of this instruction.
      5.5.1.2. Violations will be recorded on the DD Form 1408.
   5.5.2. Traffic complaints. When a traffic complaint is received on an individual, the
   complainant must be willing to provide a written statement. Failure to provide a written
   statement or an adequate description of the vehicle (e.g., color, make, license plate number
   [i.e., Tama (Prefecture) 58Y 57-89]) will result in no action being taken. Once a written
   statement is obtained, the incident will be recorded in the 374 SFS blotter. Complaints
   against Air Force affiliated personnel will be forwarded to the responsible Air Force unit
   commander or First Sergeant for follow-up and/or action. Complaints against members of
   other services will be forwarded to the appropriate agency for follow-up and/or action, if
   warranted.
      5.5.2.1. A DD Form 1408 may be issued based on the validity of the complaint.
   5.5.3. Off installation traffic activities. 374 SFS maintains a close liaison with the JNP
   agencies and when possible, these agencies provide prompt notification via 374 SFS when
   SOFA vehicle operators are involved in accidents or incidents. JNP will also provide prompt
   notice when SOFA vehicle operators are involved in traffic accidents or detained for serious
   violations of Japanese traffic laws. All SOFA personnel MUST provide JNP officials their
   DoD ID cards and USFJ Form 4EJ upon request. Geneva Convention cards do NOT meet
   this requirement. Military members are required to show their applicable DD Form 2 series
   or Common Access Card (CAC).
      5.5.3.1. Most minor infractions of Japanese traffic law do not warrant security forces
      notification until after the fact. Traffic supervision operations off base are very different
      than on base. Specifically, if you are caught breaking traffic rules off base, you are
      subject to fines, arrest and your vehicle is subject to impoundment at your expense. ALL
      FINES AND FEES MUST BE PAID IN YEN.
YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013                                                                     51


      5.5.3.2. When the Japanese police notify the 374 SFS of a violation committed off-base
      by US Forces personnel or their families, 374 SFS/S5R assesses penalties according to
      AFMAN 31-116, AFI 31-218(I), Table 5-1, and YABI 31-116, Table 5.1 374 SFS/S5R
      will forward notifications of the alleged offense(s) to the appropriate unit for
      commander’s action. Units will then return commander’s action to S5R within 60
      calendar days for processing.
      5.5.3.3. Personnel receiving the following off-base citations will accomplish the
      following upon coordination with 374 AW/JA:
         5.5.3.3.1. If the violator was given a blue copy of the ticket, they are only required to
         pay the fine. You have 7 days from the day after the citation is issued to pay the fine
         at a Japanese bank or Japanese post office. ALWAYS KEEP THE RECEIPT AS
         PROOF OF PAYMENT.
         5.5.3.3.2. Failure to pay the fine can result in your arrest until you pay the fine. If
         you have a valid reason as to why you cannot pay the fine within the 7-day period,
         contact the 374 SFS/S1L immediately.
         5.5.3.3.3. If the violator was given a red copy of the traffic ticket, they must retain
         the ticket until they are contacted to report to the Japanese authorities for an
         interview(s) and court. The Japanese prosecutor will contact 374 AW/JA, unit
         commander, first sergeant, or agency chief.
         5.5.3.3.4. 374 AW/JA will coordinate with the violator’s unit and subsequently place
         the violator on administrative hold, pending adjudication. The violator is not
         permitted to depart on leave or TDY off-island until the ticket is resolved. Prior to
         proceeding to court, the legal office will conduct a briefing outlining the violator’s
         rights under the SOFA.
             5.5.3.3.4.1. 374 AW/JA will provide 374 SFS/S3 a listing as well as updates of
             all personnel placed on administrative hold.
         5.5.3.3.5. JNP ticketing procedures: 374 SFS/S1L is notified by the JNP in writing
         anytime a SOFA member is issued a traffic ticket. The 374 SFS/S1L provides an
         office form (Notification of Traffic Infraction or Notification of Alleged Offense) and
         forward it to 374 SFS/S5R to notify the violator’s unit of the infraction.
         5.5.3.3.6. Removal of points does not authorize removal of driving record entries for
         moving violations, chargeable accidents, suspensions, or revocations. Recorded
         entries will remain posted on individual driving records IAW AFMAN 31-116 and
         AFI 31-218(I).
5.6. Disposition of Driving Records. Handled IAW AFMAN 31-116.

   Notice, simultaneously when they come in contact with or are notified of suspected
   abandoned vehicles. This will be documented in the 374 SFS blotter. All other cases outside
   of abandonment will warrant the issuance of the DD Form 2504 only.

   acted upon by 374 SFS/S2I, one copy will be placed with the vehicle, case file and one copy
   will be forward to the individual’s unit. 374 SFS/S2I will attempt to identify or locate the
   registered owner of the vehicle. If unable to do so they will impound the vehicle and it will
   be documented in the blotter. Outside support will be provided as follows:
   6.4.5. IAW AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, 374 LRS will provide 24-hour towing support.
       6.4.5.1. Dispatch operations may be called to move disabled POVs, non-appropriated
       fund (NAF) or AAFES vehicles causing traffic safety or fire fighting obstacles on base.
       Requests warrant immediate action.
       6.4.5.2. Only 374 SFS may make these requests.
       6.4.5.3. Wrecker operators are not liable for any damages incurred to any POV, NAF, or
       AAFES vehicle being towed or removed under these conditions.
6.5. Form Documentation. DD Form 2505, Abandoned Vehicle Removal Authorization, DD
Form 2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report, DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle Impoundment, will
be accomplished upon impounding vehicles. The following procedures apply and will be
documented in the blotter.
   6.5.1. 374 SFS/S4V contacts 374 LRS Vehicle Operations Flight (374 LRS/LGRO) to
   arrange for the vehicle to be towed to the impoundment lot. A DD Form 2505 will be
   completed and provided to the wrecker driver if requested. All due care and caution should
YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013                                                                     55


   be exercised during impoundment actions. Personnel from 374 LRS/LGRO and 374
   SFS/S4V are not liable for any damage(s) that may occur during the impoundment process.
   6.5.2. Once the vehicle has been impounded, make an entry in the 374 SFS blotter stating
   the make, model, year, registration and/or license number of the vehicle and location from
   which it was impounded. Impounded vehicles will be thoroughly searched and inventoried
   by 374 SFS/S2I, unless the impoundment was based on criminal activities. If so, SFS/S21
   will seek proper search authority. A DD Form 2506 will be completed for each vehicle
   impounded. Annotate any valuable personal property found in the vehicle.
   6.5.3. In the event the owner or lien holder is identified, a DD Form 2507 and a letter will be
   forwarded to him or her via certified mail stating their vehicle has been impounded. The
   owner or lien holder will be advised if no reply is received by the applicable date (60 days of
   the date the DD Form 2507 and letter is mailed), the vehicle will be disposed of through a
   local junkyard or other authorized agencies. The owner or lien holder may claim the vehicle
   or release it to the government by completing the release on the back of the DD Form 2507.
   Prior to the vehicle being released to the owner he or she is responsible for paying any
   towing and/or storage charge from the date the vehicle was impounded. The vehicle will not
   be driven out of the impoundment lot unless all base regulatory requirements (i.e., insurance,
   registration, safe operating order, etc.) are met. If the vehicle is towed out of the vehicle
   impound lot, other than a wrecker, a “A” “I” or “T” framed tow device or bar will be utilized.
   If the owner or lien holder cannot be identified, release the vehicle to the local junkyard or
   other authorized agency 60 days from the date the vehicle was impounded.
   6.5.4. When an owner is not verified, the DD Form 2504 will be annotated and the vehicle
   will be disposed of IAW AFI 31-206 and DoD Manual 4160.21-M.
6.6. Retrieving an Impounded Vehicle. The process of retrieving a vehicle from 374 SFS/S2I
is determined by or for the reason for impoundment.
   6.6.1. If a vehicle was impounded subsequent to a DUI case, the owner is required to de-
   register the vehicle through 374 SFS/S5P based on the revocation of their driving privileges.
   6.6.2. If a vehicle was impounded due to expired insurance, the owner is required to have a
   valid insurance policy prior to retrieving the vehicle.
   6.6.3. If a Japanese inspection is expired, the vehicle owner will have to obtain a temporary
   license plate from 374 SFS/S5P before they can retrieve the vehicle.
   6.6.4. If a vehicle was impounded as a result of a vehicle accident and it is considered
   evidence, it will not be released until the case is complete and approval is granted by 374
   SFS/S2I and 374 AW/JA.
   6.6.5. If the vehicle was impounded as a result of possible abandonment, the vehicle will not
   be released until approval is granted by 374 SFS/S2I.
   6.6.6. In all cases, a letter signed by the vehicle owner’s unit commander, first sergeant, or
   agency chief is required to retrieve the vehicle (see Attachment 6).
   6.6.7. After 60 days, 374 SFS/S5P will have the authority to deregister abandoned vehicles
   via the appropriate LTO and GOJ agencies. All attempts to contact the owner will be made
   prior to deregistration; however, permission is not required.
56                                                          YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013

  cost of towing, storage and man hours used to impound the vehicle by 374 SFS/S2I. They
  will hold impounded vehicles for up to 60 days. If vehicle is not claimed within 60 days, 374
  SFS/S2I will dispose of the vehicle and the individual will be assessed a total cost of all fees.

Terms
Ability—The physical proximity, coupled with the motor skills to put the vehicle in motion by
manipulation of the ignition, gears, and/or release of the emergency brake. A young child being
left unattended in a vehicle could have the ability and physical motor skills to release the
emergency brake and put a vehicle into motion.
Access—The right and privilege to enter or utilize.
374 AW Form 68EJ, Provisional Visitor/Vehicle Pass—These passes are to be used for one
day temporary vehicle passes or when DBIDS is not functioning. Identifies individuals and
vehicles not possessing appropriate DoD and installation media. Passes issued from other
installations are not valid for entry onto Yokota AB. The duration of the pass will coincide with
the length of the visit. The sponsor, not the visitor determines pass length.
Aggressive/High Risk Driver—The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
defines aggressive driving as “the operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is
likely to endanger persons or property.” Aggressive driving is a traffic offense, not a criminal
offense like road rage (NHTSA, Aggressive Driving Prosecutors’ Planner). According to
NHTSA there have always been aggressive drivers. Incidents leading to crashes, injuries and
even fatalities are becoming more prevalent. Aggressive driving manifests itself as a
combination of reckless operating characteristics resulting in highway behavior dangerous to
other roadway users, and contributes to needless losses. These behaviors include a list of
“symptoms” that create serious risk when combined with other variables such as vehicles, other
drivers, traffic congestion, visibility and road conditions. Some of these aggressive driver
behaviors include; excessive speeding, tailgating, erratic lane-changes, excessive acceleration
and braking, unsafe passing, intentional red light running, passing off the traveled portion of
YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013                                                                       61


highway, lane change violations, speeding beyond the traffic flow and failure to yield at ramps or
intersections.
Driving Under the Influence (DUI)—The term DUI as used in this publication is in reference
to the Yokota AB Commander’s Drinking and Driving Policy and is not legally tied to Article
111 of the UCMJ.
Driving While Impaired (DWI)—The term DWI as used in this publication is in reference to
the Yokota AB Commander’s Drinking and Driving Policy and is not legally tied to Article 111
of the UCMJ.
Drunk or Impaired—Any level of intoxication that is sufficient to impair the rational and full
exercise of the mental or physical faculties. The term drunk is used in relation to intoxication by
alcohol. The term impaired is used in relation to intoxication by other substances other than
alcohol.
Entry Authority List (EAL)—Authenticated, typewritten, chronological source document
identifying guests by full name, destination and the inclusive period which access is required.
The sponsor assumes responsibility of the conduct and action(s) of their guests while on the
installation. EALs are designed to give access to individuals, not their POVs. If vehicle access
is required, the sponsor will annotate and verify the visitor meets entry and/or insurance
requirements.
Installation Entry/Exit Point Checks—Administrative inspections directed by the installation
commander designed to protect the readiness, health and welfare of the installation.
Japanese Compulsory Insurance (JCI)—Required by Article 5 of the Automobile Liability
Security Law of Japan. JCI provides personal injury type coverage with limits. Under this law,
no automobile may be driven until the owner shows proof of the compulsory insurance. It does
not cover any liability for any property a vehicle operator might damage by operating a motor
vehicle.
Major Accident—An accident that causes a fatality or injuries, the vehicle cannot be moved
under its own power, it sustained over $10,000 in damage.
Minor Accident—An accident where no one was injured, sustained less than $10,000 in-damage
and the vehicle is able to move under its own power.
On Base—The areas confined within Yokota AB and Tama Hills Recreational Area.
Off Base Jurisdiction—IAW USFJI 31-203, Law Enforcement Procedures in Japan, the areas
in falling under the responsibility of the Kanto Regional Police Bureau consisting of Saitama-
Ken, Ibaraki-Ken, Tochigi-Ken, Gunma-Ken, Chiba-Ken, Niigata-Ken, Nagano-Ken, Chuo
Expressway and the areas falling under the responsibility of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police
Department (Tokyo-To) except the Machida Police Station.
Operate—Operating a vehicle, aircraft, or vessels includes not only driving or guiding a vehicle
while it is in motion, either in person or through the agency of another, but also setting of its
motive power in action, or the manipulation of its controls so as to cause the particular vehicle to
move.
Parked and/or Standing—The vehicle is stationary, with or without the engine running, with or
without the operator at the controls. Parked and/or standing vehicles can be legally or illegally
 62                                                           YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013


parked. For the purpose of enforcement, there is no difference between parked and standing. No
vehicle will be left unattended with the engine running.
Passes to Foreign Nationals—Foreign nationals are not citizens or nationals of the United
States or Japan. Passes, temporary or permanent, will not be issued to foreign nationals desiring
to conduct business on 5 AF installations until a favorable local agency check has been
completed and applicants present proof of having legal resident status in ventures in Japan, or a
valid alien registration card. In questionable cases, applicants must obtain certification of legal
residence status from offices of the GOJ Bureau of Immigrations. Passes will not be issued past
visa or resident status expiration dates.
Passenger—Person within the vehicle other than the operator.
Pedestrian—Any person who is near or on a roadway using a sidewalk, roadway edge, parking
lot, pedestrian road crossing, driveway, or similar location.
Physical Control and Actual Physical Control—These terms are synonymous. They describe
the present capability and power to dominate, direct, or regulate the vehicle either in person or
through the agency of another, regardless of whether such vehicle is operated. For example, the
intoxicated person seated behind the steering wheel of a vehicle with the key in the vehicle in or
near the ignition but with the engine not turned on could be deemed in actual physical control of
the vehicle. However, the person asleep in the back seat with the keys in his or her pocket would
not be deemed in actual physical control. Physical control necessarily encompasses operation.
Reckless Driving—The operation of a vehicle is “reckless” when it exhibits a culpable disregard
of foreseeable consequences to others from the act or omission involved. Recklessness is not
determined solely by reason of the happening of an injury, or the invasion of the rights of
another, nor by proof alone of excessive speed or erratic operation, but all of these factors may
be admissible and relevant as bearing upon the ultimate question; whether, under all the
circumstances, the manner of operation of the vehicle was of that heedless nature which made it
actually or imminently dangerous to occupants, or to the rights or safety of others. It is driving
with such a high degree of negligence that if death were caused, the accused would have
committed involuntary manslaughter, at least. The condition of the surface on which the vehicle
is operated, the time of day or night, the traffic and the condition of the vehicle are often matters
of importance in the proof of an offense.
Revocation—Loss of driving privileges for more than 6 months.
Roadway—A portion of a highway improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel,
exclusive of the sidewalk, berm, or shoulder even though persons riding bicycles, or other human
powered vehicles use such sidewalk, berm, or shoulder. A highway typically includes two or
more separate roadways. The term “roadway” as used herein, shall refer to any such roadway
separately, but not to all such roadways collectively. Roadway lanes are identified from the curb
to centerline.
Road Rage—A deliberate attempt to harm other persons or property arising from an incident
involving use of a motor vehicle. This is a criminal matter and thus will not be addressed
further.
YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013                                                                   63


Skaters—Individual operating roller skates, roller blades, skateboard and T-handled boards and
scooters. Motorized scooters (gas or electric powered) are not authorized on Yokota AB
property.
Sobriety Checkpoints—Sobriety checkpoints are based on crime trend and traffic enforcement
analysis, and are designed to protect the readiness, health and welfare of the installation. 374
SFS personnel, as augmented by 374 AW units, conduct checks.
Suspension—Loss of driving privileges for 6 months or less.
U-turn—Turning a vehicle on a roadway so as to go in the opposite direction whether done by
one continuous move or not.
Vehicle—Every device in, upon, or by which any person or property is or may be transported or
drawn upon a highway, excepting devices moved by human power or used exclusively upon
stationary rails or tracks.
Wing Traffic Review Officer (WTRO)—The 374 MSG/CD or in his or her absence, the 374
MSG/DD has been designated as the WTRO by the 374 AW/CC.

                         FACTS ON CAR INSURANCE IN JAPAN

Note: This attachment explains what JCI is and why US Forces personnel are required to carry
additional coverage for POV and OV-plated vehicles. US Forces personnel are reminded not to
assume their US carrier insurance is valid or recognized in Japan. Contact your personal
insurance agent to find out the facts and seek legal advice if you need help in deciding what
commercial insurance coverage to purchase.
A5.1. What is JCI? Japanese Compulsory Insurance (JCI) is mandatory basic-level insurance
for motor vehicles operated in Japan. The insurance provides for liability costs associated with
causing bodily injury or death to another person. JCI coverage applies to passengers in your
vehicle, pedestrians and passengers of other vehicles.
   A5.1.1. In cases of personal injury, JCI pays for treatment, consolation money and other
   costs up to a maximum of ¥1,200,000 for each person you injure in one accident. If you
   injure several people in one accident, JCI will pay up to ¥1,200,000 of medical expenses for
   each person you injure.
   A5.1.2. In cases of death, JCI will pay up to ¥30,000,000 for each death you cause in an
   accident. If in one accident you kill several people, JCI will pay up to ¥30,000,000 on each
   death. If in an accident you cause physical handicap to several people, JCI will pay up to
   ¥30,000,000 for each physical handicap you cause.
A5.2. Why do I have to buy JCI? Article 5 of the Automobile Liability Security Law of Japan
requires JCI. Under this law, no automobile may be driven until its owner shows proof of the
compulsory insurance. This law is very similar to many of the compulsory insurance laws in the
US. As already stated in this instruction, US Forces must abide by Japanese laws for motor
vehicles.
A5.3. What is not covered by basic-level JCI? JCI does not protect you in the case of
property damage caused by you or any other expense exceeding those listed in USFJI 31-205.
A5.4. Who pays for personal injury or death damage over and above JCI coverage? This
instruction makes it mandatory for you to purchase personal injury coverage of $300,000 or
¥30,000,000 and property damage liability coverage of at least $30,000 or ¥3,000,000 in addition
to what JCI will cover.
   A5.4.1. If you cause injury or death damage exceeding your JCI policy coverage and your
   private insurance coverage, you are responsible. JCI protects you only in case you injure or
   cause death to other people by the use of your vehicle.
   A5.4.2. JCI does not cover liability for any property you might damage by the use of your
   vehicle. If in an accident caused by you there is damage to someone’s vehicle, fence, house,
   storefront, or other property, you must have property damage liability coverage to protect
   you.
   A5.4.3. To put things in perspective, $30,000 or ¥3,000,000 may be less than the value of a
   single automobile. As to the question of who pays for personal injury damages in excess of
   JCI coverage, consider the following examples: A commercial insurance company in Japan
   was required to pay for its policy holder ¥70,000,000 in the case of an injury to a 3-year-old
YOKOTAABI31-116 8 MAY 2013                                                                        69


   boy by a car. Another judgment in the amount of ¥120,000,000 was made in the case of a
   man killed in a car accident. JCI would not have come close to covering those judgments.
   Commercial insurance companies in Japan recommend we buy, in addition to JCI,
   ¥50,000,000 coverage for each person injured or killed in an accident. Many local nationals
   purchase ¥100,000,000 personal injury and death liability insurance in addition to and above
   their JCI coverage. You are encouraged to carefully consider purchasing additional
   insurance over and above the JCI and USFJ requirements.
A5.5. Is my family covered if I have only JCI protection? No, JCI provides bodily and death
coverage with limits as set out above and is written "on the car." Your family will be covered
under the JCI coverage you have on your vehicle for personal or death damages only. There is
no property damage liability coverage under JCI.
   A5.5.1. There have been instances in Japan of DoD personnel assuming their family
   members were automatically covered as operators by their commercial insurance policy, then
   finding out the policy only covers drivers of a specific age. There are four types of policies
   available for purchase in Japan: One has no coverage for people under 21 years of age, a
   second has no coverage for people under age 26, a third has no age limitation, and the fourth
   covers drivers by name only and no one else. You should be very careful when purchasing
   property or personal injury damage insurance. Specifically determine who is covered in the
   event of loss before anyone operates the motor vehicle.
A5.6. Does JCI cover property damages my family or I may cause? No. JCI does not cover
any property damages you or your family may cause in an accident. You have to get protection
from a commercial insurance company for such damages. This is why this instruction requires
you buy $30,000 or ¥3,000,000 of property damage liability coverage before you can register
and keep a two or four-wheeled motor vehicle on a USFJ installation.
A5.7. If my car is damaged by a hit-and-run driver or someone who won't pay or who says
he or she can't pay, then who pays? In these circumstances, there are three different courses of
action you may take:
   A5.7.1. You can pay for the damages yourself out of your pocket.
   A5.7.2. You can hire a Japanese lawyer and take your case to Japanese court.
   A5.7.3. You can make a claim against your collision insurance coverage on your car if you
   carry such insurance. Don’t confuse collision coverage, which is usually carried by people
   owning new and expensive cars, with property damage liability coverage. Property damage
   liability coverage will pay for somebody else’s property you destroy or damage. For you to
   be paid for your car, you must have collision coverage for your insurance to cover your car
   damage.
A5.8. Should I buy and carry collision and comprehensive coverage on my car? Collision
insurance is what covers repairs to your car in case of an accident. If the other person is at fault,
his or her property damage coverage should take care of repairing your car. If you are at fault,
you need collision coverage to repair your car. Comprehensive coverage is for things such as
fire, theft, or breakage of a windshield. To keep premiums down, both coverage are usually
bought with a deductible; that is, you pay the first $50-$500 of such damage. For advice on
additional coverage, consult a legal representative or insurance professional.

A5.9. Suppose I'm driving while impaired or guilty of reckless driving and with my car
cause property damage to another car and I have no property damage insurance or
money. What will happen to me? You may be criminally prosecuted in Japanese court for
DWI or reckless driving. If the accident occurs on base, or if the Japanese waive jurisdiction to
the US, you could face non-judicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, or even courts martial
as applicable. You will also likely lose your on-base driving privileges. Further, your
misconduct, whether prosecuted by the Japanese or branch of service, could constitute grounds
for administrative discharge. In any event, you will be responsible for paying for the property
damage you cause.
A5.10. Japan, like many other Asian countries, has customs, which determine what will be
expected from you if you cause, or are even involved in, an accident, which results in injuries or
damage. Japanese people usually make a swift payment of several hundred dollars to express
their regret under such circumstances. Failure to do so may be taken as an insult and affect
subsequent negotiation over civil liability. The proper behavior is even more important because
people involved in car accidents causing personal injuries can be charged with Professional
Negligence under the Japanese Criminal Code and fined up to ¥500,000 or jailed for up to 5
years forced labor. Therefore, it is in your best interest to contact your insurance agent
immediately following any accident, so that he or she may advise you on these matters. The
base legal office can also provide assistance in this area.
