                                          Chapter 1

                         POLICY AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

1.1. Background.
   1.1.1. The Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS) was developed
   primarily to meet the Congressionally-mandated Defense Incident-Based Reporting System
   (DIBRS) requirements and improve day-to-day operations of the Air Force Security Forces.
   It also provides statistical data for various users, and has grown to meet many other needs.
   1.1.2. The SFMIS complies with DIBRS reporting criteria and provides the means to
   monitor and apply Air Provost and Integrated Defense selective enforcement measures.
   SFMIS also is useful for analysis of law enforcement statistics, as well as threat fusion.
   Future capabilities will be added to SFMIS through the HQ Air Force Security Forces Center
   (AFSFC) and Major Command (MAJCOM) Configuration Control Board (CCB).
   1.1.3. Access to SFMIS by any personnel should be carefully scrutinized to ensure integrity
   of the system and protection of For Official Use Only (FOUO) and Privacy Act information.
       1.1.3.1. IAW AFI 33-200, Information Assurance Management, the AFNetOps/CC
       approved access by foreign nationals to unclassified Air Force Information Systems (IS)
       where AFNetOps/CC is the Designated Accrediting Authority (DAA) or has delegated
       that responsibility. Before foreign nationals are authorized access and use of ISs, they
       must meet the requirements of AFI 31-501 and AFSSI 8522. This includes the AF
       provisioned portion of the Global Information Grid (GIG), (e.g. unclassified base LAN).
   1.1.4. SFMIS users must know and ensure they meet the requirements of the Privacy Act of
   1974 and report data only to those who have a valid need to know.
   1.1.5. Criminal Activity Reporting. The SFMIS fully complies with the following
   requirements:
       1.1.5.1. Report criminal activity to National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS)
       per the Uniform Federal Crime Reporting Act;
       1.1.5.2. Victim and witness notifications per the Victim’s Rights and Restitution Act of
       1990
       1.1.5.3. Establishment of a central DoD database on domestic violence incidents per the
       Lautenberg Amendment to the Gun Control Act of 1968; and
       1.1.5.4. Recurring requests for overall DoD law enforcement data.
1.2. Responsibilities.
   1.2.1. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (OUSD
   (P&R)) develops overall policy for DIBRS and monitors compliance.
   1.2.2. The Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) is directed by OUSD/P&R to keep a
   central repository of incident-based statistical data for analyzing trends in response to
   executive, legislative and oversight requests for information on criminal and high-interest
   incidents. DMDC created the data collection system to track and report DIBRS information
6                                             AFI31-203_AFMCSUP_I 23 FEBRUARY 2011


    from initial contact through investigation, prosecution, confinement and release. DMDC also
    reports NIBRS data to the FBI.
    1.2.3. The Air Force DIBRS reporting process is triggered when law enforcement responds
    to a credible report of a criminal incident. If a crime is outside the jurisdiction of the Air
    Force law enforcement organization, DIBRS reporting is still a Security Forces responsibility
    for military members; however, jurisdiction/NIBRS reporting passes to the appropriate
    agency, such as Defense Criminal Investigative Organizations, FBI, or the local authority
    that has investigative jurisdiction of the case.
    1.2.4. Active, Reserve and Air National Guard Security Forces units will comply with the
    reporting requirements mandated by Congress and outlined in DODD 7730.47, Defense
    Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS), and DoD 7730.47-M, Manual for Defense
    Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS).
    1.2.5. AFSFC/SFOP is the Air Force Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for the SFMIS
    implementation and budgeting. SFMIS is funded through the operational budget of AFSFC.
    1.2.6. AFSFC/SFOP is the functional lead for developing the SFMIS capabilities, by
    working with the MAJCOMs, via the CCB. AFSFC/SFOP:
       1.2.6.1. Works with 554th Electronic Logistics Systems Group (ELSG) at Maxwell
       AFB-Gunter Annex, AL, to develop SFMIS and other Automated Information System
       requirements. (See para 1.2.11 for 554 ELSG responsibilities.)
       1.2.6.2. Coordinates, once a month, or as necessary, with 554 ELSG to report DIBRS
       data to the DMDC.
       1.2.6.3. Periodically reviews the system‘s usage to ensure compliance by all MAJCOMs
       and their respective units.
       1.2.6.4. Directs corrective action on SFMIS errors.
       1.2.6.5. Chairs Functional Review Board (FRB). The FRB consists of functional subject
       matter experts and meets to discuss the needs/future needs of SFMIS.
       1.2.6.6. Chairs Configuration Control Board.
           1.2.6.6.1. Brings AFSFC/SFOP and the Program Managers Office (PMO) together to
           prioritize/discuss the needs of SFMIS.
           1.2.6.6.2. Grants access when notified in writing by a MAJCOM A7S Director of the
           appointment of a System Administrator (SA) at a MAJCOM.
           1.2.6.6.3. AFSFC/SFOP is the overall SFMIS SA.
    1.2.7. Each MAJCOM A7S should appoint a primary and alternate SA to grant permissions
    and access for the MAJCOM‘s units. No contractor is authorized to be an SA unless
    approved in writing by AFSFC/SFOP. MAJCOMs will provide a copy of appointment
    letters to AFSFC/SFOP, and a signed copy of the Global Combat Support System-Air Force
    (GCSS-AF) Form 41, System Authorization Access Request.
       1.2.7.1. MAJCOMs are encouraged to send a representative(s) to the CCB meetings.
       Representatives should be able to discuss current and future SFMIS requirements.
AFI31-203_AFMCSUP_I 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                         7


     1.2.7.2. MAJCOM SFMIS SAs should monitor units to ensure that reports of
     commander action on incident reports and traffic tickets are forwarded to DIBRS on a
     timely basis (commander‘s action completes the report for the DIBRS database).
     1.2.7.3. MAJCOMs will not approve use of other automated programs as substitutes for
     existing SFMIS capability.
     1.2.7.4. SFMIS operates through the use of role-based access, granted to authorized users
     at all levels in the System Administration Module. When notified in writing by the
     installation Security Forces commander, of the appointment of a SA at an installation, the
     MAJCOM SA will grant specific accesses and roles.
     1.2.7.5. MAJCOM SAs should periodically review the use of SFMIS by the command‘s
     units and ensure everyone is using the system as required. Such reviews should also be
     considered during inspections and staff assistance visits. MAJCOMs are encouraged to
     develop checklists to ensure compliance.
  1.2.8. Installation commanders must ensure all DIBRS-specified incidents, and reports of
  command action, are reported via SFMIS. This includes ―internal‖ investigations which are
  NIBRS/DIBRS reportable incidents. For definitions of reportable incidents, refer to DoD
  7730.47-M, Manual for Defense Incident-Based Reporting System. DIBRS-reportable
  incidents must be documented on an AF Form 3545A, Incident Report, or Report of
  Investigation, and reported to SF Admin and Reports or AFOSI. Note: Reports of Survey
  (ROS) are often related to the theft, loss, or damage of government property, which are also
  usually DIBRS reportable. An ROS can be added to an AF Form 3545, Incident Report, as
  an attachment. The purpose of an ROS is to determine if the person is accountable for the
  item and does not establish criminal activity. NOTE: AF Form 3545A, Incident Report, is a
  SFMIS generated incident report. An AF Form 3545, Incident Report, is used at locations
  where SFMIS is not available and a hard copy generated report must be completed using
  Word or IMT.
     1.2.8.1. Only commanders designated on ―G-Series‖ orders are authorized to sign the
     Command Action of the AF Form 3545A, Incident Report, or Report of Investigation.
     Unit Commanders or Section Commanders are the only personnel allowed to sign the
     Command Action area of the DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket.
     1.2.8.2. Local Security Forces units must verify with local agencies any Civil
     incarceration of military personnel on active duty to ensure DIBRS-related information is
     submitted via SFMIS.
     1.2.8.3. Installation commanders must ensure command action on incident reports and
     traffic tickets is reported via SFMIS within the suspense set by the local Security Forces
     Administration & Reports Section or other activity, per AFMAN 31-201 Volume 7,
     Security Forces Administration & Reports, Chapter 1, para 1.5.3. Timely reporting of
     command action ensures compliance with DoDD 7730.47 and DMDC timelines.
  1.2.9. Security Forces Unit Responsibilities.
     1.2.9.1. The installation Security Forces squadron commander will appoint a Primary
     and Alternate SA. The appointment letter will be sent to the respective MAJCOM SA.
     No contractor is authorized to be an SA unless approved in writing by AFSFC/SFOP. If a
8                                           AFI31-203_AFMCSUP_I 23 FEBRUARY 2011


    unit feels they need more administrators, it will be requested in writing and considered on
    a case-by-case basis, with final approval coming from AFSFC/SFOP. SAs will act as the
    local grantors of roles and level of access for personnel requiring access to SFMIS. SAs
    will only have access to the SA module in SFMIS. They must create another account to
    have access to the other modules without SA rights. NOTE: Group accounts are NOT
    authorized.
       1.2.9.1.1. (Added-AFMC) The installation Security Forces squadron commander
       will appoint a primary and at least one alternate System Administrator (SA), in
       writing, and forward a copy to HQ AFMC/A7SOI (e-mails with scanned versions of
       the signed letter are acceptable.) DOD 8750.01-M, Information Assurance Workforce
       Improvement Program, can be referenced for general system administration
       information.
       1.2.9.1.2. (Added-AFMC) The installation Security Forces squadron commander
       will conduct an annual review of the SA appointment letter and update as necessary.
       Updated letters or negative replies are due to HQ AFMC/A7SOI NLT 30 Jan each
       year.
       1.2.9.1.3. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/A7S will update the MAJCOM SA
       appointment letter as necessary and send updated letters immediately to
       AFSFC/SFOP.
    1.2.9.2. The installation Security Forces commander will establish internal controls to
    allow management to view each DIBRS-reportable incident. Normally, the NCOIC, SF
    Administration Reports, Operations Superintendent, SF Investigations, Operations
    Officer and Commander are granted full access as reviewing and approving officials
    before the data is transmitted up the chain.
    1.2.9.3. The installation Security Forces commander will ensure all DIBRS-reportable
    incidents are reported through SFMIS. The report of commander‘s action is of paramount
    importance to the Air Force‘s responsibility for DIBRS reporting. On a yearly basis,
    DMDC provides DoD with DIBRS data on criminal statistics. One of the major areas
    reviewed is commander‘s action reports. To ensure Air Force compliance, SF unit SA
    will conduct a monthly review of all pending cases and attempt to finalize them. An
    incident is not considered finalized until it‘s either adjudicated or determined no action
    taken.
       1.2.9.3.1. SFMIS entries are also required for most Security Force responses
       requiring some type of action to be taken besides a standalone AF Form 1168,
       Statement of Suspect, Witness, or Victim (e.g. traffic violation, vehicle accidents, etc.)
       1.2.9.3.2. (Added-AFMC) SFMIS entries are not required for minor vehicle
       accidents. Members will be instructed to exchange insurance information and may
       submit their personal accounts and claims with their respective insurance agencies.
       Responding patrols will document minor vehicle accidents in accordance with local
       procedures.
    1.2.9.4. The Security Forces Reports and Analysis (SFAR) section will establish a 60-
    day suspense for reports requiring commander action and place them in a suspense file.
    Annotate the suspense date on the cover letter of the report. If prior histories exist, print
AFI31-203_AFMCSUP_I 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                         9


     and attach the history to the report for the commander‘s information. (Note: Prior
     histories are normally provided only for suspects/subjects of the report.) If response on
     command action is not received by the due date, dispatch a letter, ―Notice of Late
     Suspense‖ giving an immediate suspense. If a response is not received after 7-days, send
     a ―Notice of Second Late Suspense‖ to the unit commander with a courtesy copy to the
     group commander. DFC can extend suspsenses on a case-by-case basis.
     1.2.9.5. On the first duty day of each month, each SFAR section will perform a computer
     run of the previous month‘s Criminal Summary Report. They will then task the Security
     Forces Investigations Section to compare that reporting with the local AFOSI detachment
     point of contact to ensure all Defense Clearance and Investigations Index (DCII)
     information is reported. DCII is a single, automated central repository that identifies
     investigations conducted by DoD investigative agencies and personnel security
     determinations made by DoD adjudicative authorities. This is done to ensure duplicate
     incidents are not entered into DCII and that all incidents are recorded as required. NOTE:
     DCII is an automated central index that identifies investigations conducted by
     Department of Defense investigative agencies. AFOSI is the agency that heads entry into
     DCII.
        1.2.9.5.1. ANG units may run their reports on the first UTA of each month. This
        may be accomplished by the DFC appointed SFMIS monitor or that individual‘s
        alternate.
     1.2.9.6. The DFC will ensure a copy of AF Forms 3545A, Incident Report, or the SFMIS
     Incident Report and criminal history, CVB Forms 1805, Violations Notice, are transferred
     to the local AFOSI detachment when reporting to DCII is required and copies are filed in
     the SF Administration & Reports filing system.
        1.2.9.6.1. The local AFOSI may be satisfied with having the Criminal Summary
        Report in lieu of the AF Form 3545A, Incident Report, and Report of Investigation.
        The main objective is to ensure all DCII information is provided to the AFOSI
        officials.
        1.2.9.6.2. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Security Forces units which are
        co-located on active duty Air Force bases will not run the Criminal Summary Report.
        They will forward the DIBRS-reportable information to the active duty host Security
        Forces unit, which will perform the computer run of the previous month‘s Criminal
        Summary Report.
     1.2.9.7. Air Force Corrections. Each installation, whether they have a confinement
     facility or not, is responsible for entering inmate information into the SFMIS
     Confinement Module as well as reporting the case outcome to SFAR. The only
     exception is Air Force inmates confined in civilian facilities on civilian charge(s). The
     SF unit Corrections Officer or point of contact will ensure this entry has been completed
     on every member sentenced to confinement by a court-martial. NOTE: Personnel
     referred to USAF SF Level I confinement facilities must have the crime resulting in their
     confinement reported to DIBRS via SFMIS or AFOSI channels.
  1.2.10. The AFNETOPS/CC serves as the DAA for SFMIS.

  1.2.11. The 554 ELSG is responsible to design, acquire, install, integrate and support the
  information systems necessary to provide the Air Force with the right combat support
  information.
     1.2.11.1. The 554 ELSG assists AFSFC in developing an Operational Requirements
     Document that will serve as the Statement of Work (SOW) for a SFMIS project. AF/A7S
     will be the final approving authority for new requirements.
     1.2.11.2. The 554 ELSG utilizes contractors as necessary to meet Security Forces
     requirements.
     1.2.11.3. IAW DoDI 8510.01 the 554 ELSG is responsible for appointing an Information
     Assurance Manager (IAM) for SFMIS. The IAM will be qualified IAW DODD 8570.1.
  1.2.12. (Added-AFMC) All deviations to the required use of SFMIS must be submitted in
  memorandum format through HQ AFMC/A7SOI, who will in turn coordinate them with
  AFSFC/SFOP for final approval.
  1.2.13. (Added-AFMC) Utilization of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) information
  management systems are not authorized without HQ AFMC/A7S approval. Units will
  coordinate all issues involving procurement of any COTS information management systems
  with HQ AFMC/A7S prior to purchase of COTS software and hardware.
AFI31-203_AFMCSUP_I 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                          11


                                          Chapter 2

            REPORTABLE DISCIPLINARY INCIDENTS AND SECURITY

2.1. Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS).
   2.1.1. DIBRS is primarily a reporting system covering all active duty, reserve, and guard
   military personnel. Security Forces must input civilian data for those who commit offenses
   on Air Force installations into National Incident-Based Report System (NIBRS), which is the
   primary reporting system for all civilians.
   2.1.2. For definitions of reportable incidents, refer to DoD 7730.47-M, Manual for Defense
   Incident-Based Reporting System.
   2.1.3. The installation Security Forces commander will ensure all reportable DIBRS
   incidents are entered into SFMIS. DIBRS submissions must be completed by the 15th day of
   each month. DIBRS submissions pending final action, to include the report of commander‘s
   action, must be tracked until final disposition.
      2.1.3.1. Units must correct DIBRS errors. The Security Forces commander can
      determine if this is the responsibility of the patrolmen, SFAR, SA, etc. SFAR must search
      for DIBRS errors at least monthly and attempt to correct entered errors. See Attachment
      2 for some common DIBRS errors and corrective action.
   2.1.4. The AF Form 3545A, Incident Report, or Report of Investigation, records the data
   reportable to the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC). Incidents not covered by DIBRS
   will be documented and reported under Uniform Code of Military Justice guidelines. The
   SFMIS-generated Incident Report Summary (AF Form 3545A) or an original AF Form 3545,
   is approved for use as the final file copy and to document, with original signature or digital
   signature, the Commander‘s Action.
   2.1.5. The Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records is the only authority who can
   order SFMIS records be cleared; regardless of the outcome of the report and age of the
   offender.
2.2. National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS).
   2.2.1. NIBRS (Reportable for CONUS only) has the same responsibilities as outlined in
   section 2.1. NIBRS is comprised of 6 segments (e.g., Administrative Segment, Offense
   Segment, Property Segment, Victim Segment, Offender Segment, and Arrestee Segment) and
   53 data elements.
   2.2.2. Reporting requirements for civilian offenders are only required by NIBRS.
2.3. Security and Passwords
   2.3.1. SFMIS is Common Access Card (CAC) enabled. In order to access SFMIS with your
   CAC card, it must be done through the AF Portal. The CAC card can only be associated with
   one user name. If multiple user names are required for your duty position then users will be
   assigned user names/passwords for access and permissions commensurate with ―the need to
   know‖ information within the system. Individual passwords will not be shared with other
   users. It is a system security violation for multiple users to share the same user ID and
 12                                          AFI31-203_AFMCSUP_I 23 FEBRUARY 2011


   password. Passwords will be changed at least every 60 calendar days, immediately upon
   compromise, or after 45 days of inactivity. SFMIS can identify the number of days
   remaining until a change of password is required.
       2.3.1.1. Audits of the system will be done as warranted for proper accountability when
       there is a change in SA.
   2.3.2. Should a lockout occur as a result of an improper or forgotten password, the
   MAJCOM or unit SA will assign a new password; however, the account will remain locked
   for a period of one hour or until the user‘s identity can be positively identified. Users who
   have expired accounts must have their passwords reset through the system administrator or
   554 ELSG/Field Assistance Service (FAS) at DSN 312-596-5771/COMM 334-416-5771.
   MAJCOM SAs can perform this function for unit SAs. Unit SA‘s can perform this function
   for members of their unit. Problems encountered should be forwarded to the 554 ELSG/FAS
   for resolution. If a problem cannot be resolved within a reasonable time (24 hours), ensure
   the user gets a trouble ticket from the FAS, which will be forwarded to the SFMIS Program
   Managers office, until the problem is fixed.
       2.3.2.1. If you have log-in problems due to your CAC please refer to local procedures to
       unlock your CAC card.
2.4. Privacy Information. All SFMIS data is protected by the Privacy Act and must be handled
as For Official Use Only (FOUO). All information will be strictly controlled in accordance with
AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program of 1974, to ensure it is only released to officials
with a need-to-know. Individuals may access the SFMIS for authorized, official purposes
only. Military members who improperly access SFMIS or its information, or provide or
enable such access to third parties, for other than official, authorized purposes, may be
punished under Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), as well as any other
applicable articles of the UCMJ or provisions of federal or state law. Civilian personnel
who improperly access SFMIS or its information, or provide or enable such access to third
parties, for other than official, authorized purposes, may be prosecuted under applicable
provisions of federal or state law. Violations by military or civilian members may result in
the full range of authorized administrative and disciplinary actions without regard to
otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions for violations of related laws.
   2.4.1. All SFMIS users must be aware that data displayed on monitors may be susceptible to
   unauthorized viewing. Take appropriate action to ensure privacy data is always protected.
   2.4.2. Protection can be enhanced by installing additional ―time-out‖ features when the
   system is not being used, or installing ―screen savers‖ at prescribed time intervals. The SA
   can assist in applying these features.
   2.4.3. Violations of the system‘s operation or unauthorized release of the ―FOUO‖
   information will be immediately reported to the unit SA, who will notify the commander at
   each level of concern.
       2.4.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Squadron SAs will immediately report known violations of the
       system operation or unauthorized dissemination of ―For Official Use Only‖ (FOUO)
       information to the installation Security Forces squadron commander. If an unauthorized
       dissemination of FOUO information is determined to be a Privacy Act violation, the
       Installation Privacy Act Manager (usually a member of the base Communications unit)
AFI31-203_AFMCSUP_I 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                     13


     must be notified. Completed Reports of Investigation (AF Form 3545 may be
     substituted) on the incident will be forwarded to HQ AFMC/A7SOI no later than 15 duty
     days from the date of occurrence.
  2.4.4. The installation Security Forces commander will coordinate with all base functions
  that may require access to SFMIS information. This will normally include Wing/Support
  Group Commanders, Staff Judge Advocate, AFOSI and Military Equal Opportunity staff.
  Access refers to information contained in SFMIS which SFAR can print out, not a user
  name/password. Personnel outside security forces who need live access to SFMIS should be
  given ―read only‖ access with Security Forces commander‘s approval. Other agencies
  should be carefully screened to validate a need to enter SFMIS and approved locally by the
  Security Forces commander.

                                          Chapter 3

                                   SYSTEM OPERATION

3.1. Hardware/Software Requirements.
   3.1.1. SFMIS is a web-based product. It requires Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher. The system
   is password protected. SFMIS uses state-of-the art integrated software to ensure all data is
   properly encrypted for security and meets DoD Certification and Accreditation standards.
   3.1.2. For best performance use hardware/software as recommended by DISA at Maxwell
   AFB Gunter Annex Alabama. Note: As technology advances and changes are made to
   accommodate future data, upgrading of peripherals may also be required. Should this occur
   MAJCOMs will be notified in advance.
   3.1.3. (Added-AFMC) The installation Security Forces squadron commander will consider
   SFMIS requirements when replacing computers within the unit, and should ensure future
   expenses for modernization of the system are reflected in annual budgets.
3.2. SFMIS capabilities. This list is not all inclusive and more features are added with each
SFMIS release. Currently, the SFMIS program has the following capabilities:
   3.2.1. Case Reporting, Accidents, Tickets (principal module for reporting DIBRS).
       3.2.1.1. Some capabilities include entering reports and citations, DEERS search,
       Suspension/Revocation/Debarment (SRB) Roster, case search and a history search.
   3.2.2. Limited Confinement (to be DIBRS compliant).
       3.2.2.1. Some capabilities include tracking DIBRS-reportable information, inmate
       release dates, pre-trial/post-trial confinement and victim notification.
   3.2.3. System Administration.
       3.2.3.1. Some capabilities include resetting passwords, creating accounts and adding
       roles. Note: If you have a SA account the only module you can access with the SA user
       name is the SA Module.
   3.2.4. Pass & Registration.
       3.2.4.1. Some capabilities include issuing visitor passes, Restricted Area Badges (RAB)
       and DD Form 2220 issuance, if used. (RAB module is not currently mandatory to use,
       due to the fact it cannot encode the magnetic strip for gate access).
       3.2.4.2. (Added-AFMC) Units will issue DD Forms 2220 and 2219 as requested
       individually by base personnel, IAW applicable HAF guidance.
   3.2.5. Combat Arms
       3.2.5.1. Some capabilities include inputting training requests, class assignment, course
       fired, AF Form 522 History and supply account.
   3.2.6. Armory
AFI31-203_AFMCSUP_I 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                          15


       3.2.6.1. Some capabilities include placing weapons/munitions/equipment in inventory,
       tracking weapon issues and the authority to bear arms, registration of Privately Owned
       Vehicles/Privately Owned Weapons (POV/POW).
   3.2.7. Web-based Computer-Based (CBT) Trainer (available in release 6.0).
       3.2.7.1. The primary capability is an Interactive step-by-step process for each module on
       SFMIS.
   3.2.8. ‗Oracle ―Discover Viewer‖‘
       3.2.8.1. The primary capability is searching for statistics which offers parameter setting
       for ad-hoc queries
   3.2.9. MAJCOMs or units desiring additional capability must contact the SFMIS POC at
   AFSFC/SFOP, 1517 Billy Mitchell Blvd, Bldg 954, Lackland AFB TX 78236-0119, DSN
   312-945-0266/5028.
   3.2.10. AFSFC/SFOP periodically publishes SFMIS Newsletters. This information will
   appear on the SFMIS ―Message of the Day,‖ AFSFC‘s homepage and/or posted on the
   SFMIS Administrators and Users Community of Practice (on the AF Portal). These
   messages inform users of developments, new releases, and other important information.
   Users should check these sources for updates often, and are highly encouraged to submit
   items to AFSFC/SFOP for future publication.
3.3. Assistance. The FAS also provides assistance to Base Network Control Centers, Defense
Mega Centers and users worldwide. New user accounts must be created by MAJCOM or local
SA. The FAS is not empowered to validate authorized use.
3.4. On-Line Manual. The SFMIS program has an online help manual available for users. The
manual is user-friendly and can be printed for easy reference. Refer to DoD 7730.47, Defense
Incident-Based Report System, for the DIBRS/NIBRS code tables. Note: These code tables are
subject to change. DMDC controls the additions/deletions on the code tables.
3.5. SFMIS Training. The installation Security Forces commander must ensure their personnel
are trained to use SFMIS to meet their installation needs and DIBRS requirements. Training and
familiarization should not be conducted using the SFMIS ―live‖ system modules because of the
potential for mistakenly reporting false information. To facilitate hands-on training at the
MAJCOM and unit level, the SFMIS Training Site (DMZ) may be utilized. MAJCOM and unit
SAs can request access to this training site by contacting the 554 ELSG Program Management
Office. Do not contact the FAS for DMZ access. Once the MAJCOM or unit SA is granted
access to the DMZ, user access can then be granted. The SFMIS DMZ can be accessed at
https://ser-0367-dmapp.saic.com/SFMIS5/.
   3.5.1. Computer-Based Training (CBT). The SFMIS CBT module provides familiarization
   and refresher training. It is the primary means for familiarization training. CBT can be found
   on the SFMIS homepage.
   3.5.2. Mobile Training Team (MTT). Units may also request 554 ELSG to conduct a MTT
   to provide familiarization training at the requesting unit‘s expense. This training must be
   scheduled so it does not impact a SFMIS mission requirement or release. You can obtain this
   information on the SFMIS page or contact AFSFC/SFOP, DSN 945-0266/5028/Comm 210-
 16                                       AFI31-203_AFMCSUP_I 23 FEBRUARY 2011


   925-0266/5028, or 554 ELSG/PMO DSN 596-5004/6700 Comm 334-416-5004/6700, for
   training assistance.
3.6. Unresolved Matters. SFMIS issues will be directed to AFSFC/SFOP, 1517 Billy Mitchell
Blvd, Bldg 954, Lackland AFB, TX 78236-0119 or afsfc.workflow@lackland.af.mil for
resolution.
AFI31-203_AFMCSUP_I 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                              17


                                            Chapter 4

                          HANDLING OF SFMIS INFORMATION

4.1. Requests for SFMIS Information.
   4.1.1. For requests for release of SFMIS information, follow AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy
   Act Program, and DOD Regulation 5400.7/AF Supplement, DoD Freedom of Information
   Act (FOIA) Program. Individuals or agencies desiring copies of reports (to include
   enclosures) or Security Forces blotters will do the following:
      4.1.1.1. If the requester desires copies of statements, they must submit a request under
      the Privacy Act (AFI 33-332) or the Freedom of Information Act, as required by DOD
      Regulation 5400.7, as supplemented.
      4.1.1.2. Insurance companies requesting case reports concerning clients will make the
      request in writing. Units will assess a fee per DOD Regulation, 7000.14-R, Volume 11a,
      Reimbursable Operations, Policy and Procedures. Company checks will be used and
      made payable to Base Finance and mailed to the local SFAR office. Turn over checks to
      Finance using DD FM 1131, Cash Collection Voucher. No fees are assessed to private
      individuals requesting information on incidents they were involved in unless copies
      exceed regulatory amounts. Consult DOD 7000.14-R for further guidance.
      4.1.1.3. Police or government agencies (e.g. Drug Enforcement Agency, Recruiters,
      Family Advocacy) requesting information for official reasons will receive all requested
      information after the identity of the agency can be verified. Such requests must be made
      either in person upon proper identification or using official letterhead. The written
      request can be mailed or faxed. Ensure the requester is advised to include points of
      contact, mailing addresses and phone or fax numbers to ensure a prompt response.
      Ensure requesters are authorized release under the Privacy Act (AFI 33-332) before
      disclosing the information. The requester‘s letter will be attached to the case files/blotters
      for a matter of record. Responses can be mailed or faxed back. Maintain a log to verify
      action was completed.
   4.1.2. If the government was involved in an incident or the situation might result in litigation
   against the government, consult the Staff Judge Advocate before release of any information.
   4.1.3. Statistical information may not be released without AFNETOPS/CC approval. This
   does not prevent Installation Commanders/DFCs from using their own statistics to obtain
   criminal patterns or brief personnel on criminal activity in the local area of their installation.
   Statistics will not be released for unit, numbered AF, regional, or MAJCOM comparisons.
   While local commanders may desire this information for comparison purposes, this does not
   meet the System Security Access Agreement‘s requirement for a valid ―need to know‖ in
   order to release SFMIS information. Improper release of information without a valid need-
   to-know may jeopardize continued SFS access to the SFMIS. Contact AFSFC/SFOP for
   additional guidance.
   4.1.4. All SFMIS users are required to read their responsibilities of safeguarding SFMIS
   information and sign acknowledging these responsibilities. All units will keep on file the
   acknowledgement of responsibilities for personnel within their unit. A copy of the
 18                                          AFI31-203_AFMCSUP_I 23 FEBRUARY 2011


   responsibilities of safeguarding information along with the acknowledgement of
   responsibilities  can   be    found   on the     SFMIS  CoP>SFMIS     Supporting
   Documentation>Account Generation Documentation.

4.2. Adopted Forms.

                                       Attachment 2
              COMMON DIBRS ERRORS AND CORRECTIVE ACTION

A2.1. Introduction:
   A2.1.1. This attachment contains common errors associated with the monthly Defense
   Incident Basted Reporting System (DIBRS) to the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC)
   and corrective actions which should be taken to correct them.
A2.2. Common Mistakes Causing Errors:
   A2.2.1. The mistakes listed here have the potential of causing several different types of
   errors or prevent the record to be transmitted.
   A2.2.2. Check DIBRS/NIBRS Buttons as Required.
      A2.2.2.1. When users are entering in reports, they need to refer to the offense tables to
      determine when these buttons need to be checked to comply with congressionally
      mandated reporting requirements.       After receiving the results from the April 2008
      submission and researching the cause of these errors; users still have many cases
      erroneously unchecked despite this requirement. SFMIS has help documentation to assist
      users in identifying which cases have reporting requirements.

   A2.2.3. Improper Routing of Case
      A2.2.3.1. As illustrated below, users need to ensure they properly route cases.
AFI31-203_AFMCSUP_I 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                       23

   A2.2.6. A608 If Category is AA (Arrestee), Arrest Type is required
      A2.2.6.1. This error message informs the user when an offender                       is
      apprehended/detained, the type of arrest must be indicated in the case report.

   A2.2.9. A802 Personal information         (last   name,   first   name)   is   missing   from
   Offender/Arrestee Report segment.
      A2.2.9.1. As shown in the figure below, SFMIS will generate a person identification
      number for unknown persons. However, if a record is reported to DMDC in this state it
      will cause an error.
          A2.2.9.1.1. Scenario 1: User enters information indicating an apprehension took
          place, when in fact one did not take place. If an apprehension did in fact take place
          the offender record needs to be updated accordingly.

Figure A2.8. DIBRS Box.




         A2.2.9.1.2. Scenario 2: Upon opening up the offender record (by double clicking
         the name of the offender – not the person icon, which opens the person dialog),
         several cases do not have complete names. For example, the offender record has a
         first and middle name but not last name in the record.
   A2.2.10. A806 SSN/Alien Registration (Field 71) should be provided when SSN/Alien
   Registration Designator (Field 70) is present in Offender/Arrestee segment.
      A2.2.10.1. In the Apr 2008 submission all 806 errors were from OS bases on foreign
      nationals. However, they were listed as family member/dependents. Further research
      needs to be conducted on whether or not these people are issued SSNs.
   A2.2.11. A810 Both SSN/Alien Registration Designator (Field 70) and SSN/Alien
   Registration (Field 71) should be provided in Offender/Arrestee segment if non-"00"
   Offender ID exists.

   A2.2.12. D514 Transaction attempted to process a segment for which no parent incident
   (segment M) exists
   A2.2.13. This error message informs the user when SFMIS attempts to submit a
   commander‘s action record which there is no longer a case report for. This is most likely
   caused by different record retention periods required by the USAF and DMDC. SFMIS
   maintains case reports for five years, at which time the records are purged as required by the
   Air Force Records Management System (AFRIMS), unless Brady Law or other requirements
   apply. DMDC does not have a purge requirement at this time. These differences cause these
   types of errors which may require manual correction by the SFMIS Program Management
   Office (PMO).
   A2.2.14. D576 For Sanction Type AU, field 106 (Sanction Amount) is required
       A2.2.14.1. This error message informs the user when an entry into the commander‘s
       action record and the sanction (field 106) states fines (AU) have been imposed, the
       amount of the fine must be included.

   A2.2.15. D577 For Sanction Types AH, AV and AW, Sanction Days is required
      A2.2.15.1. This error message informs the user when an entry into the commander‘s
      action record and the sanction (field 106) states a delay of promotion (AH), extra duty
      (AV), or restriction (AW) has been imposed; the number of days must be included.

   A2.2.16. D780 Warning: Missing Offender/Arrestee segment for Commander's Report
   segment (orphan D segment exists)
      A2.2.16.1. This message informs the user they need to ensure the commander‘s action
      record matches the case record. Also, ensure that the commander‘s action record is
      complete. For example, if you have an ―Administrative‖ action taken against the
      offender, select the applicable sanction(s).
   A2.2.17. D801 Personal information (last name, first name) is missing from Commander's
   Report segment.
      A2.2.17.1. This error messages informs the user there is an error with offender‘s name in
      the commander‘s action. The example shows the error due to the offender‘s name not
      being complete. This information must be corrected in the offender record, and the
      person record should be reviewed.

   A2.2.18. D815 Personal information (last name, first name) is missing from Commander's
   Report segment.
      A2.2.18.1. This error informs the user an offender‘s name is missing or does not match
      the case report. In this example you will note the offender names do not match it the
      Incident Report and the Commander‘s Action Record. Once reported to DMDC, this
      will cause an error. Users need to correct the information as outlined in D801.

   A2.2.25. R514 Transaction attempted to process a segment for which no parent incident
   (segment M) exists
      A2.2.25.1. This error message informs the user when SFMIS attempts to submit an
      administrative segment which there is no longer a case report for. This is most likely
      caused by different record retention periods required by the USAF and DMDC. SFMIS
      maintains case reports for five years, at which time the records are purged as required by
      the Air Force Records Management System (AFRIMS), unless Brady Law or other
      requirements apply. DMDC does not have a purge requirement at this time. These
      differences cause these types of errors which may require manual correction by the
      SFMIS Program Management Office (PMO). Before referring these incidents to the
      PMO ensure that all confinement records are tied to an incident report.
   A2.2.26. R789 Report Date should not be before Arrest/Apprehension Date

   A2.2.28. R817 Personal information (last name, first name) in Correction does not match
   Offender/Arrestee.
      A2.2.28.1. Ensure the names in the case report match the confinement module. This
      may happen due to letters being transposed, or name changes due to marriage or divorces.
   A2.2.29. V597 UCMJ Code 134-U7 should not be used -- use the Offense Code for the
   offense solicited instead
      A2.2.29.1. When reporting incidents to DIBRS do not select the offense ―Solicitation‖
      instead, use the offense which was solicited. The person that performed the act should be
      listed in the offender tab as ―Principal‖ and the offender which asked them to perform the
      offense is the ―Solicitor.‖
      A2.2.29.2. As a reminder, our reporting system is incident based, not offender based.
      Please remember, that if more than one offense occurred, and not all offenders were
      involved separate case reports need to be generated. This is not due to how SFMIS is
      designed, but due to the DIBRS/NIBRS (National Incident Based Reporting System)
      records incidents. A lot of valuable information in how case reports should be handled is
      included in the DIBRS manual.

         that person‘s will or not forcibly or against the person‘s will in instances where the
         victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her temporary or permanent
         mental or physical incapacity. Note: If force was used or threatened, the crime should
         be classified as Forcible Rape regardless of the age of the victim. If no force was used
         or threatened and the victim was under the statutory age of consent, the crime should
         be classified as Statutory Rape.
     A2.2.32.2. 36B Statutory Rape
         A2.2.32.2.1. Definition: Non-forcible sexual intercourse with a person who is under
         the statutory age of consent. Note: If force was used or threatened, the offense should
         be classified as Forcible Rape not Statutory Rape.
