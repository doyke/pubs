SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: changed content and organization of the adult and pediatric code carts; changed code
blue notification procedures; deleted code blue response team, changed code blue
documentation; and clarified life support certification and training requirements.
1. Code Blue Procedure Overview.
     1.1. A code blue denotes any cardiac or respiratory event requiring urgent or emergent
     intervention and additional resources.
     1.2. Personnel discovering the emergency will immediately call for help, activate the
     emergency response system (9-1-1) by calling the designated Wilford Hall Ambulatory
     Surgical Center (WHASC)/Lackland Air Force Base emergency number, announcement of
     code blue via overhead paging/announcement system (if applicable), and begin basic life
     support (BLS). Note: Dialing 9-1-1 from a cell phone will activate the San Antonio
     Emergency Response System (EMS). All medical personnel in the area are expected to
     participate fully, and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) or pediatric advanced life support
     (PALS) certified personnel from nearby areas should respond. Unit-based emergency call
     signals are not to be used as a substitute for calling (9-1-1). The second responder will
     retrieve the nearest code cart or Automated External Defibrillator (AED). Any additional
     responders may fill the following roles in accordance with their scope of practice: code
     leader, code cart manager, Monitor/AED operator, recorder, chest compressor(s), airway
     manager(s), crowd control, or other roles as determined by the code leader. The most
     qualified responder will assume charge of the resuscitation and may begin advanced life
     support (ALS) techniques when qualified and within their scope of practice, until properly
     relieved by a more qualified ALS certified healthcare provider or paramedics. When
     relieved, the recorder will inform the new code leader of all interventions implemented, and
     circumstances under which the arrest was discovered. If the patient is in a critical care area,
     such as the Post Anesthesia Care Unit or operating room, the ALS Certified licensed
     provider(s) may choose to conduct the resuscitation without announcing a “code blue,” but
     they must immediately contact the Medical Response Center (MRC) to arrange for patient
     transport. See Attachment 2
     1.3. The code leader supervises the administration of medications, defibrillation, and
     performance of all procedures, ensuring appropriate ALS protocols and standards are met.
     The code leader, or his/her designee, ensures a post-code blue conference is accomplished,
     and documentation is accurate and complete.
     1.4. The senior person from the area/unit (or designee) will ensure the AED (if used) is taken
     to BMET for interrogation. The AED will be cleaned with an appropriate facility-approved
     (IAW manufacturer’s recommendations) disinfecting agent (Sani-Wipes®, etc.) after use on a
     victim and before taking to BMET.
59MDWI44-142 10 APRIL 2013                                                                        3


       1.4.1. The senior person from the area/unit (or designee) at the scene will also participate
       in the post-code blue conference. If the nurse manager (or equivalent) is not present for
       the code, the senior person will be responsible for ensuring that the 59 MDW Form 1280,
       Cardiac Respiratory Arrest Record, any rhythm strips, and a code blue critique
       memorandum for record (MFR) are given to the Nurse Manager (or equivalent). The
       code blue critique MFR will answer the following questions: Did first responder begin
       BLS IAW American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines? Was code blue notification
       accomplished properly? Was code cart, or AED, brought to the patient immediately after
       notification, if not sooner? Was a code blue recorder assigned? Did ambulance team
       respond in a timely manner? (Note response time and issues that delayed response.) Was
       all equipment needed available? Was all equipment needed functioning? Was a code
       leader clearly identified? Was a post conference held with staff to discuss performance?
       Were rhythm strips attached to code blue recording sheet? The code blue critique MFR
       will be signed by the nurse manager or equivalent and the medical director of the area.
       The MFR is a quality assurance document so each page should have the following
       statement at the bottom, “QUALITY ASSURANCE MATERIAL PROTECTED BY 10
       U.S.C. 1102 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.”
   1.5. Entrance Access Issues.
       1.5.1. In the event of a code blue in an area with restricted access, a staff member (not
       involved in the code) should be posted at the restricted access point to allow entrance of
       the code responders.
       1.5.2. In the event of a code involving a patient who is radioactive, the MRC/code blue
       announcement will include that information. The Radiation Safety Officer will be
       contacted by the MRC (or designee).
2. Resuscitation Working Group. The Resuscitation Working Group reports to the Executive
Committee of the Medical Staff and serves as the policy making body for the formulation,
institution, and revision of policies and protocols for emergency response. The working group
generally meets quarterly at the call of the chairperson. Membership includes multidisciplinary
representation from Medicine, Nursing, Urgent Care Center (UCC), EMS, Pediatrics, ACLS
Program Director, Pharmacy, Process Improvement Advisor (PIA), and Life Support Office.
3. Medical Response Center.
   3.1. Upon receiving a code blue notification, the MRC/Emergency Control Center will
   obtain information (i.e. unit/clinic, room number, and if the patient is adult or pediatric) from
   the caller, and dispatch paramedics. See Attachments 2 and 3.
   3.2. A code blue announcement will be made (See Attachment 2) via the overhead
   paging/announcement system. In general, the announcement should be as follows:
   "Attention in the facility, Adult (or) Pediatric code blue, work-center location, and room
   number.” Repeat announcement two times.
   3.3. MRC personnel will provide information related to code blue events to Risk
   Management/Quality Improvement personnel, Patient Safety Office, and Resuscitation
   Working Group upon request for tracking purposes.
 4                                                                59MDWI44-142 10 APRIL 2013


4. Transfer of Critically Ill Patients. In the event that an out-patient becomes critically ill
during a clinic/lab appointment or out-patient procedure, the MRC is contacted to initiate an
EMS transport. If the patient’s condition requires continued use of special equipment, supplies
or personnel during transport, an ACLS qualified licensed provider shall accompany the patient.
The provider and/or EMS personnel must also ensure the return of any WHASC equipment
and/or supplies used during transport.
5. Patient Placement Post-Code. Once EMS has responded to a code blue, the patient will be
transported to the nearest appropriate facility.
6. Code Blue Documentation. The medical director for the clinic or unit where the code was
initiated will perform the initial medical review. The following documents will be hand carried
to the appropriate PIA Risk Management (RM) within ten working days of the code blue event.
     6.1. A copy of the 59 MDW Form 1280 as indicated, to include copies of rhythm strips. At
     a minimum, strips should display the rhythm upon discovery, the rhythm after the
     administration of medications, the rhythm after defibrillation or cardioversion, any major
     rhythm changes, and the rhythm associated with final outcome. The original 59 MDW Form
     1280 is filed in the medical record and accompanying rhythm strips are to be filed in the
     patient’s chart by scanning in to Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application
     as an addendum to an encounter or teleconference.
     6.2. The original completed code blue critique MFR is submitted to the appropriate PIA or
     RM and will be maintained by the PIA or RM offices as per their respective policies.
     6.3. Copies of the completed 59 MDW Form 1280 and code blue critique will be provided to
     appropriately associated 59 MDW staff physicians for oversight reviews. Given the
     multidisciplinary nature of resuscitation, a single cardiac arrest may be reviewed by
     providers/nurses from separate groups. Meeting minutes that review code blue critique
     trends/analysis are considered peer review.
7. Code Carts and AEDs are strategically located throughout the 59 MDW in order to
provide basic and advanced life support in the event of a code. Oversight of the code carts is
provided by the Resuscitation Working Group.                     Any changes, modifications or
additions/deletions of the carts, their locations, or their contents must have the prior approval of
the Resuscitation Working Group.
     7.1. Non-healthcare personnel working in areas where a code cart is not located must be
     oriented to the location of the nearest AED and its operation, the procedure for activating the
     Emergency Response System, and initiating Basic Life Support for non-healthcare personnel
     (HeartSaver).
     7.2. All healthcare personnel, regardless of the area in which they work, must be oriented to
     the location and operation of the nearest AED. Healthcare providers who work in an area
     where a code cart is located must also be oriented to, and be familiar with, the code cart, its
     location, its contents, the operation of all life support equipment, and their anticipated role in
     a code in accordance with their individual scope of practice.
     7.3. The officer in charge (OIC) and/or non-commissioned officer in charge (NCOIC) are
     responsible to notify the Life Support Office (LSO) when new code cart monitoring
59MDWI44-142 10 APRIL 2013                                                                     5


  personnel are appointed, any change in location of code cart, or if a unit is scheduled to open
  or close.
  7.4. Each cart is self-contained and equipped with all necessary items needed for ALS.
  Adult code carts are standardized for the general adult patient with selected items for the
  pediatric patient. Pediatric code carts are standardized for the pediatric population
  (Attachment 4, 5, 6).
  7.5. Waiver Procedure. The following procedure will be used to modify code cart contents
  and/or schematics:
     7.5.1. A new schematic reflecting the changes must be submitted, detailing drawer
     number, layout of all items, and their stock levels. Medication changes must also detail
     the name, concentration, dose, and mode of delivery.
     7.5.2. A cover letter justifying the need for the deviation/modification from the standard
     cart must be submitted in addition to the new schematic. It must be signed by the area
     OIC and endorsed by the flight and squadron commanders.
     7.5.3. Upon approval by the Resuscitation Working Group, the waiver approval letter
     and modified schematic will be placed into the code cart binder behind Tab 2 “Approved
     Waiver letter (required for any deviation from schematics)”. A copy will also be given
     to the LSO.
  7.6. Maintenance of the Code Cart.
     7.6.1. The unit OIC is ultimately responsible for the integrity of the code cart and
     ensuring that proper training and maintenance is performed.
     7.6.2. All code carts must remain locked. Cart contents are only for codes.
     7.6.3. Code cart locks are obtained from the Pharmacy and must be signed for. The
     locks are considered a controlled item and must be stored in a locked cabinet (not to
     include the code cart) or in the PYXIS®. Annotate reason for changing the lock, and the
     new lock number on the 59 MDW Form 2995, Daily/Monthly Code Cart Checklist.
     7.6.4. The individual performing an inventory of the code cart must verify the packaging
     of the medication tray is intact and within the expiration date. If the packaging is not
     intact or the tray has expired it must be replace immediately. Medication trays are
     obtained from the Pharmacy by returning the used or expired tray for a new one.
  7.7. Required checks by unit personnel.
     7.7.1. Using 59 MDW Form 2995, unit personnel will perform, and annotate, code cart
     equipment checks each shift to verify that correct items are present on top of the cart
     (stock levels and expiration dates if applicable), oxygen tank level, and the lock number
     and its integrity.
     7.7.2. A complete inventory of the code cart is accomplished immediately after each
     code and monthly, during the last five days of each month. All expired or missing items
     will be replaced promptly. The person completing the inventory must annotate the new
     lock number and sign the signature line of the checklist.
 6                                                              59MDWI44-142 10 APRIL 2013


        7.7.3. A new daily/monthly checklist is initiated each month for the code carts. The
        current checklist, and the previous month, will be kept in the code cart binder behind Tab
        3, “Daily/Monthly Code Cart Checklist (current and previous months only)”. All
        previous checklists will be kept by the NCOIC (or equivalent) according to records
        management plan.
     7.8. Quality Assurance Code Cart Inspection Program. The LSO will implement a Quality
     Assurance Program of the code carts within the 59 MDW by maintaining a list of all code
     cart locations and conduct annual no-notice inspections using 59 MDW Form 66, Life
     Support Code Cart Inspection Record. Any discrepancies must be addressed and/or
     corrected the day of inspection. The inspection results will be forwarded to the appropriate
     unit personnel at the discretion of the LSO. Code cart inspection data will also be reported to
     the Resuscitation Working Group.
     7.9. Facility Automated External Defibrillators:
        7.9.1. Requests for AED placement within WHASC will be brought before the
        Resuscitation Working Group for approval by The Working Group Chairman.
            7.9.1.1. Once authorized by the Chairman, an AF Form 601, Equipment Action
            Request is submitted to the Medical Equipment Management Office by the requesting
            area/unit.
        7.9.2. Zone Masters (or designees) are responsible for the maintenance and monthly
        checks of all AEDs in their areas. AED management training will be included in the
        Zone Master Training course.
            7.9.2.1. The Life Support Office will conduct quality assurance inspections of all
            AEDs within WHASC, at least annually.
     7.10. AED contents and supplies:
        7.10.1. Each AED will contain all items listed in Attachment 7 “WHASC AUTOMATED
        EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR (AED) SUPPLY PACK” in order to be “serviceable”.
        7.10.2. Replacement supplies or batteries are obtained through BMET.
        7.10.3. In the event that an AED is used for a victim of a medical emergency, BMET
        will interrogate the used AED at the next available opportunity and have AED Patient
        Report/Code Summary printed and available for the area/unit within 4 working days for
        use in the post code blue critique session. A replacement AED must be provided to the
        area/unit while interrogation is being performed.
8. Life Support Office Training Responsibilities.
     8.1. Chief, Division of Education and Training:
        8.1.1. As representative of the 59 MDW Commander, the Education and Training Chief
        nominates candidates to the Military Training Network (MTN)/AHA for appointment as
        the Program Directors for MTN’s Life Support Programs.
        8.1.2. Collaborates with group and squadron commanders to ensure organizational
        compliance with specified training requirements IAW Air Force and MTN directives.
59MDWI44-142 10 APRIL 2013                                                                   7


     8.1.3. Ensures the LSO maintains an adequate amount of supplies and functional
     equipment to conduct training as required by program regulation (i.e. Military Training
     Network or equivalent).
  8.2. Ensures the training site faculty, program directors and administrators remain compliant
  with the program guidance outlined in the MTN Handbook, current edition.
  8.3. Life Support Office:
  8.3.1. Coordinates resuscitation courses, schedules mock code blue (MCB) evaluations and
  code cart inspections.
     8.3.2. Plans training based on findings from both real and mock code blues. Ensures
     equipment for each training program is available and in good working order.
     8.3.3. Updates training database with new BLS, ACLS, PALS, and Neonatal
     Resuscitation Program (NRP) dates for personnel upon completion of course.
     8.3.4. Completes end of course documentation IAW MTN/AHA requirements.
     8.3.5. Provides the Resuscitation Working Group with metrics as requested.
     8.3.6. Forwards training reports to the MTN and/or American Academy of Pediatrics as
     applicable, and maintains records as outlined in the MTN Handbook.
     8.3.7. Manages the following programs: Mock code blue and code cart inspection.
  8.4. WHASC Individual Members Training Responsibilities.
     8.4.1. Military members, civilians, contract personnel and volunteers involved in direct
     patient care are required to maintain current certification in AHA Healthcare Provider
     BLS (or equivalent course based on published national guidelines for BLS) IAW AFI 44-
     102, Medical Care Management, section 3D. The 59 MDW adheres to the guidelines of
     the AHA and the American Academy of Pediatrics for all life support programs. Non-
     medical personnel (including civilians, contractors, and volunteers) who are not involved
     in patient care, whether assigned to a patient care area or non-patient care area, must
     maintain current certification in AHA BLS HeartSaver AED (or equivalent). Squadron
     commanders may waive the BLS requirements for volunteers and contract personnel who
     do not perform direct patient care and have permanent physical limitations or disability,
     which prevents them from completing BLS certification. Contractors not involved in
     direct patient care and whose contract does not include the BLS certification requirement,
     are exempt from the requirement. These individuals must receive documented training
     on emergency reporting procedures. The waiver and documentation of training is
     maintained in the individual’s competency assessment folder. Courses not provided by
     the AHA must follow the current national guidelines to include skills (hands on) and
     cognitive testing, with a passing grade.
     8.4.2. ACLS certification is required by AFI 44-102 for any privileged healthcare
     provider (physician, resident physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner or nurse
     anesthetist) assigned to the emergency department or urgent care center. In addition,
     ACLS certification is required by any privileged healthcare provider who provides
     moderate sedation or general anesthesia to adults (18 years and older), regardless of the
     clinical area where the care is being provided except when exempted under the conditions
8                                                          59MDWI44-142 10 APRIL 2013


    of paragraph 8.4.3. Dentists who only provide dental officer on-call coverage, or acute
    dental care, and do not provide sedation do not need to be ACLS certified; dentists who
    provide sedation or general anesthesia must be ACLS certified. The use of nitrous oxide
    alone or with local anesthetic does not require ACLS certification.
    8.4.3. As per AFI 44-102, individuals with sufficient experience in managing
    cardiopulmonary arrest situations independently may request a letter of exemption for
    ALS training from the 59 MDW Commander. This exemption must be reviewed by the
    credentials function and re-accomplished every two years. Documentation pertaining to
    the nature and extent of each review will be maintained in the appropriate provider
    credential file.
    8.4.4. ACLS training is required for nurses and optional for medical technicians,
    assigned to the Emergency Department or UCC.
    8.4.5. PALS certification is required as per AFI 44-102, for any privileged healthcare
    provider (physician, resident physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or nurse
    anesthetist) assigned to the emergency department or UCC. PALS certification is also
    required by any privileged healthcare provider assigned to inpatient pediatric duties. In
    addition, PALS certification is also required by any privileged healthcare provider who
    provides moderate sedation or general anesthesia to infants, children, and/or adolescents
    (before the 18th birthday) regardless of the clinical area where the care is provided, in
    lieu of ACLS requirements. Dentists, or dentist residents, providing dental officer on-call
    coverage only, but do not provide moderate sedation, do not need to be PALS certified.
    Dentists who provide moderate sedation or general anesthesia to pediatric patients must
    be PALS certified. The use of nitrous oxide alone or with local anesthetic does not
    require PALS certification. Per instruction from Air Force Medical Operations Agency
    on January 15, 2013 Advanced Pediatric Life Support “(APLS) (The Pediatric
    Emergency Medicine Resource) is an appropriate substitute for PALS. Website for
    APLS is: http://www.aplsonline.com/default.aspx.
    8.4.6. PALS or APLS training is required for nurses, and optional for medical
    technicians, assigned to the Emergency Department or UCC or assigned inpatient
    pediatric duties.
    8.4.7. Additional Life Support certification requirements for nurses or medical
    technicians within the Military Treatment Facility are at the discretion of the 59 MDW
    Commander.
    8.4.8. Personnel must re-accomplish any required life support training as per the
    overseeing organization (ACLS, PALS, APLS, BLS).
    8.4.9. Individuals with an expired BLS for Healthcare Providers certification must
    complete a BLS for Healthcare Providers course and will be prohibited from performing
    patient care until the training is complete.
    8.4.10. New arrivals to the 59 MDW who have expired ACLS, PALS, or NRP required
    certifications must complete the training at the first opportunity, as applicable to the
    individual’s situation.
59MDWI44-142 10 APRIL 2013                                                                      9


      8.4.11. The 59 MDW Life Support instructors who are permanently leaving the facility
      must out-process through the LSO.
      8.4.12. Life Support course completion cards will not be re-issued if lost or destroyed.
      Individuals may obtain a MFR from the LSO verifying expiration date and type training
      received from the Life Support Office and the date of expiration. Individuals may
      request an MFR prior to out-processing the 59 MDW.
      8.4.13. Active duty members, Reservists/National Guardsmen, Department of Defense
      employees, and facility volunteers are eligible to attend WHASC Life Support Courses.
      Contract personnel may attend WHASC classes only if their contract explicitly states the
      training is to be done by the 59MDW.
9. Mock Code Blue Program.
   9.1. The MCB Program endeavors to ensure that all personnel are prepared to adequately
   implement procedures to sustain the life of a victim until emergency personnel arrive.
   9.2. The MCB Evaluation Team consists of at least one ACLS/BLS/PALS instructor and one
   LSO personnel. MCBs are evaluated using 59 MDW Form 69, Mock Code Blue Evaluation
   Sheet.
   9.3. Upon completion of the Mock Code exercise, the evaluation team will conduct a
   debriefing for the code participants about their performance and pass/fail status.
   9.4. MCB evaluations are conducted annually in each clinic. A failed evaluation will be
   reevaluated in 30-45 days, during which time the unit/clinic is given the opportunity to
   conduct internal training of their personnel.
      9.4.1. Failed evaluations will be disclosed to unit’s OIC/NCOIC and signatures obtained
      verifying receipt of information.
   9.5. Results of mock codes will be reported to the Resuscitation Working Group quarterly.
   Trends and actionable items will be reported by the Resuscitation Working Group to the
   Executive Committee of the Medical Staff.
10. Incapacitated Provider.
   10.1. If a surgeon or anesthesia provider should become incapacitated during a surgical case,
   the remaining provider in the room will assume immediate care of the patient and the
   incapacitated provider. He/she will direct ancillary staff to initiate the call for help to the
   flight commander (or the incapacitated provider’s service chief) and to activate the
   emergency response system (9-1-1). He/she will direct the ancillary staff in the care of the
   incapacitated provider and/or BLS procedures until additional qualified help arrives to ensure
   proper medical attention is given. (See section 2, Code Blue Procedures)
      10.1.1. The flight commander or service chief will immediately determine if the
      procedure should be finished or rescheduled and will designate a replacement for the
      incapacitated provider, if appropriate. Once urgent medical needs are provided for both
      the patient and the incapacitated provider, the flight commander or service chief will
      notify the group SGH or, if unavailable, the 59 MDW/SGH.
   10.2. If a provider of minor medical, dental or surgical procedures (done outside of the
   operating room), or conscious sedation procedures, becomes incapacitated while seeing a
10                                                           59MDWI44-142 10 APRIL 2013


  patient or during a procedure, the medical/dental personnel assisting the provider will begin
  BLS procedures, initiate the emergency response system (9-1-1), and notify the flight
  commander (or the incapacitated provider’s service chief). (See section 2, Code Blue
  Procedures)
     10.2.1. The flight commander will immediately determine if the procedure should be
     finished or rescheduled and will designate a replacement for the incapacitated provider, if
     appropriate. If the flight commander is unavailable, the service chief or squadron
     commander will make the determination. Once urgent medical needs are provided for
     both the patient and the incapacitated provider, the flight commander will notify the
     group SGH or, if unavailable, the 59 MDW/SGH.
     10.2.2. If the patient has not yet undergone a procedure and is stable, they will be
     escorted to a waiting area. The patient will be given the option of rescheduling the
     appointment or waiting for a replacement provider. If the patient opts to reschedule their
     appointment, the clinic nurse will assess the patient’s clinical status to ensure his or her
     needs are met prior to discharge from the facility; i.e., medication refills lab work, etc.

                              CODE BLUE NOTIFICATION

A2.1. Dial 9-1-1 or 292-1800 from a WHASC telephone to report a medical emergency/code
blue and provide the dispatcher with as much information as possible about the situation.
Include type of emergency, location of victim with room number, whether adult or pediatric
victim, and any other identifying or pertinent information. Personnel not involved in
resuscitation should position themselves at strategic unit entry points to direct the first
responders. A code blue notification may be cancelled by dialing the same numbers and
informing the dispatcher of the situation.
   A2.1.1. Do not call 9-1-1 from a cell phone as this will connect to San Antonio’s EMS
   dispatcher and may unnecessarily delay emergency response time.
   A2.1.2. DO NOT CALL THE UCC to report a medical emergency.
   A2.1.3. DO NOT substitute the use of unit-based “code blue buttons” or patient call bells to
   activate the emergency response system (9-1-1).
