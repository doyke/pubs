       there is a strong expectation of the Air Force receiving a recruiting or public affairs benefit. Air-
       men will be expected to use their talent primarily in the United States in a manner that generates
       significant favorable media coverage and will likely generate interest in service in the United
       States Air Force. Evaluation of requests will consider the needs of the Air Force, the quality of the
       professional performance to date, the strength of the public affairs or recruiting proposal, and
       potential positive recruiting or public affairs benefit to the Air Force. In addition, in making a rec-
       ommendation or decision on an application, reviewing authorities should consider that Airmen
       released from active duty under this provision are in effect “ambassadors” of the Air Force and
       any determination should consider whether an Airman’s records and service history, to include
       derogatory or disciplinary action, render him or her an inappropriate candidate.
          1.3.8.2.1. The approval authority for this program is the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force,
          Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR). The Airman applying for release and assignment

          commander and sent through AFPC/DPSOS to SAF/MR for approval. Any level in the pro-
          cess may disapprove the application if it does not meet the defined requirements or if deter-
          mined not to be in the best interest of the Air Force.
NOTE: For the purposes of this program, paragraph 1.4.3.2. does not apply.
