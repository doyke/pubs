     augmented MAJCOM supplement.
2.4.     Numbered Air Forces.
       2.4.1. General. NAF stan/eval (MAJCOM stan/eval when no NAF stan/eval exists) will
       maintain a tactical focus and perform the operational role in evaluating unit stan/eval
       functions within its chain of command.
       2.4.1. (AMC) General. HQ AMC/A3V assumes responsibility for functions in paragraph
       2.4 (Exception: HQ AFRC maintains NAF functions as noted.) HQ AFRC NAF/A3V
       evaluators may administer evaluations (initial, recurring, SPOT, N/N, etc.) according to the
       following restrictions. With Chief of NAF/A3V prior coordination, NAF evaluators may
       conduct observations or SPOT evaluations on any AFRC MDS or aircrew member within
       their NAF. For SPOT evaluations in a MDS or crew position in which the evaluator is not
       qualified, the evaluation is restricted to areas listed under GENERAL in the respective AFI
       11-2MDS Vol 2. At the request of the OG/CC and with the concurrence of the NAF/A3V,
       AFRC HQ/NAF/A3V evaluators may administer evaluations (see paragraph 2.4.2.6 for
       pyramid evaluation requirements) in the MDS for which they maintain qualification.
       2.4.2. Functions. The NAF stan/eval function will:
          2.4.2.1. Maintain oversight of evaluation functions in lower echelon units, in gained
          units, and in AFRC/ANG units for which oversight responsibility is assigned.
          2.4.2.2.   Conduct stan/eval visits IAW MAJCOM supplements/directives.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                               15


     2.4.2.2. (AMC) AFRC/NAFs may conduct SAVs at the request of the OG/CC or at the
     direction of the NAF/A3.
     2.4.2.3.   Coordinate on and process applicable AF Forms 847:
         2.4.2.3.1. For flight publications and technical order recommended changes IAW
         AFI 11-215.
         2.4.2.3.2.   For proposed AF publications changes IAW Attachment 9.
        2.4.2.3.3.    For MQFs IAW paragraph 2.3.2.7.2
     2.4.2.4. Provide staff coordination and control of all Flight Crew Information File
     (FCIF) items issued from the NAF level to units IAW paragraph 9.1
     2.4.2.5. Provide qualified flight examiners to augment other MAJCOM and NAF
     agencies when requested (see paragraph 2.3.5).
     2.4.2.5. (AMC) AFRC/NAF provide qualified flight examiners to augment other
     MAJCOM and NAF agencies, AMC ASEVs and mid term SAVs when requested (see
     paragraph 2.3.5)
     2.4.2.6. Administer periodic flight evaluations, when practical, to Chiefs of Stan/Eval
     or senior stan/eval crews in lower echelon units, in gained units, and in AFRC/ANG units
     for which oversight responsibility is assigned.
     2.4.2.6. (AMC) Pyramid Evaluation Program. HQ AMC/A3V will implement a
     pyramid evaluation system. Senior OG/OGV evaluators (including AFRC and ANG) or
     equivalent will receive a pyramid evaluation from HQ AMC/A3V to satisfy the 17-month
     periodic qualification requirement. HQ AFRC NAF/A3V personnel do not administer
     pyramid evaluations, unless requested by HQ AMC/A3V with prior coordination of
     AFRC/A3V. Units without MDS representation at HQ AMC/A3V do not receive HQ
     AMC/A3V flight evaluations unless directed by HQ AMC/A3. When HQ AMC flight
     examiners are not available to administer pyramid evaluations to AMC-gained AFRC
     evaluators, HQ AFRC/A3V (primary) or HQ AFRC NAF/A3V (secondary) will provide
     a flight examiner for the evaluation prior to a wing level flight examiner being scheduled
     to administer the evaluation.
         2.4.2.6.1. (Added-AMC) If there are no specific aircrew or aircraft representation
         at the pyramid level, then the next higher level is responsible. The senior evaluators
         for specific aircraft and missions receive evaluations from any appropriately qualified
         examiners when there are no qualified examiners in the pyramid above them.
         2.4.2.6.2. (Added-AMC) When a HQ AMC examiner is not available to perform a
         pyramid evaluation, examiner’s will annotate in the remarks section of the AF Form 8
         that the evaluation satisfies the requirement of the pyramid evaluation per prior
         coordination with HQ AMC A3V. Include the HQ AMC evaluator’s name. For
         AFRC crewmembers the statement should also include HQ AFRC/3V coordination
         i.e. per coordination with HQ AMC/A3V, (Rank and Name) and HQ AFRC/A3V
         (Rank and Name) this evaluation satisfies the requirement for a pyramid evaluation.
         Exception: Pyramid evaluation is not required for aircrew undergoing aircraft
         conversion, difference training on aircraft or for students completing formal
         qualification and training programs according to AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 1.

            2.4.2.6.3. (Added-AMC) Units may align Stan/Eval crewmembers’ qualification
            expiration dates to allow all crew positions eligible for their pyramid evaluations to
            complete the checkride at the same time.
            2.4.2.6.4. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC/A3V may perform a staff assistance visit
            (SAV) in conjunction with pyramid evaluations when specifically requested by the
            unit.
        2.4.2.7.   Observe execution of unit missions and provide feedback when feasible.
        2.4.2.7. (AMC) At the direction of the HQ AFRC NAF/A3, NAF A3V personnel may
        observe AFRC unit missions and provide feedback to HQ AFRC NAF/A3 or HQ
        AMC/A3V, as appropriate. Spot and No-Notice evaluations may be administered.
        Comply with the requirements of paragraph 2.3.2.13.1 (Added)
        2.4.2.8. Review and coordinate on subordinate unit supplements to operational
        procedures, flying guidance and this instruction.
        2.4.2.8. (AMC) AFRC NAF/A3V will coordinate on unit local supplements and
        forward to HQ AFRC/A3V prior to approval by HQ AMC/A3.
        2.4.2.9. Review subordinate unit Stan/Eval Board (SEB) minutes and, at a minimum,
        address any action items requiring HHQ assistance.
        2.4.2.9. (AMC)     AFRC NAF/A3V will address ARC specific issues in subordinate
        units.
        2.4.2.10. Assist MAJCOMs in the creation, review, updating and distribution of
        required MQFs. NAFs will coordinate on unit submissions to correct deficiencies to
        MQFs. Utilize AF Form 847 or submit as directed by lead MAJCOM.
        2.4.2.11. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC/A3V will consolidate and analyze data from
        aircrew trends by MDS, crew position, and AF Form 3862, Aircrew Evaluation
        Worksheet, area. Provide an electronic copy (.doc file) of trend information to HQ
        AMC/A3V (and HQ AFRC/A3V for AFRC units) semi-annually for consideration to be
        incorporated in the command’s aircrew SII Program. Along with the trend information,
        OGV will include any problems requiring HQ AMC assistance and a list of open AF
        IMTs 847 being coordinated above the wing level.
NOTE: This reporting requirement is exempt from licensing in accordance with AFI 33-324,
The Information Collections and Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public,
and Interagency Air Force Information Collections.
     2.4.3. Organization. Typical NAF stan/eval staff includes a section chief and one flight
     examiner per crew position per MDS. Manning for NAF flight examiner positions may be
     adjusted by the NAF Commander.
        2.4.3.1. (Added-AMC) HQ AFRC/NAF flight examiners will maintain flying
        proficiency (evaluator status) and should maintain full mission ready status. They should
        also be qualified or certified in as many special missions as possible. Special missions
        include receiver air refueling (AR), airdrop, joint precision airdrop system (JPADS),
        special operations air refueling (SOAR), etc. HQ AMC/HQ AFRC flight examiners are
        not required to maintain special mission currency according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1,
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                                  17


       Aircrew Training, and the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 1; but they should
       have initial qualification in the specific special mission and participate as an examiner or
       observer on at least one special mission every 6-months.
   2.4.4. Augmentation. Each NAF may use qualified augmentees from other NAFs to
   support or conduct stan/eval aircrew evaluations and inspections with concurrence of all the
   NAF stan/eval organizations involved.
2.5. Stan/Eval Visits. HHQ stan/eval staffs may visit units during the administration of formal
inspections, Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs) or in an informal capacity, as specified in MAJCOM
supplements.
   2.5.1. (Added-AMC) Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Visit (ASEV):
       2.5.1.1. (Added-AMC) Purpose. ASEVs are the principal tool for evaluating aircrew
       flight operations and verifying safe and effective mission accomplishment. This is
       achieved through aircrew testing and flight evaluations to ensure compliance with
       approved operational procedures and applicable special interest items. Additionally, the
       effectiveness of unit aircrew Stan/Eval, Training, Tactics, and Aviation Resource
       Management programs are evaluated to ensure compliance and standardization among
       flying units, and provide meaningful feedback to unit commanders.
          2.5.1.1.1. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC ASEV teams may request augmentation from
          units or user-commands. The HQ AFRC NAF/A3Vs should augment teams for
          ASEV on their respective AFRC units, and may be asked to augment any ASEV
          team. AFRC augmentee support will be coordinated through HQ AFRC/A3V.
       2.5.1.2. (Added-AMC) ASEV Testing. ASEV team will administer a closed book
       examination to all available personnel, in the grade of O-5 and below, who are qualified
       to fly unsupervised in unit aircraft. All aircrew attached at the wing or below will test.
       Test individuals who are dual MDS aircraft qualified in only their primary aircraft. The
       ASEV examinations may be used to satisfy recurring closed book testing requirements
       for flight evaluations.
          2.5.1.2.1. (Added-AMC) ASEV Tests will be derived from a minimum of 85%
          MQF questions, with the balance coming from Flight Publications,
          Safety/Operational Supplements, FCIFs, and local directives.
          2.5.1.2.2. (Added-AMC) ASEV tests have minimum passing scores according to
          requirements for closed book examinations in AFI 11-202, Volume 2. Crewmembers
          failing ASEV closed book tests will be placed in supervised status until successful
          completion of unit closed book exams.
              2.5.1.2.2.1. (Added-AMC) The ASEV team will report the names of individuals
              tested and their scores to the unit commander. The final ASEV report will list the
              average of test scores by crew position and the overall average test score.
              2.5.1.2.2.2. (Added-AMC) The ASEV team chief may elect to send the ASEV
              test after formal ASEV notification but before arrival of the ASEV team. In this
              case, the unit will identify a ―
                                             trusted agent‖ to control the ASEV test content and
              conduct unit testing, or as specified by ASEV team chief.

     2.5.1.3. (Added-AMC) Primary ASEV Flight Evaluations. HQ AMC flight examiners
     will administer in-flight evaluations to senior OG (or equivalent) Stan/Eval personnel for
     each of the unit's assigned mission or design aircraft.
        2.5.1.3.1. (Added-AMC) Do not extend the senior Stan/Eval crewmember's
        evaluation expiration date to allow evaluation during the ASEV.
        2.5.1.3.2. (Added-AMC) If any senior Stan/Eval crewmembers are scheduled to
        change within 3 months following ASEV, administer evaluations to designated
        replacements.
        2.5.1.3.3. (Added-AMC) Pyramid evaluations received within 6 months before the
        start of an ASEV will count towards the ASEV in-flight evaluation requirements.
        2.5.1.3.4. (Added-AMC) ASEV Simulator Evaluations. HQ AMC flight examiners
        may evaluate crew members in the applicable training device (if available). The
        evaluation will include all activity required for a Simulator evaluation.
        2.5.1.3.5. (Added-AMC) For KC-10 senior boom operator, use Boom Operator
        Trainer (SIM/BOT). In addition, a KC-10 CCTS instructor crew will be administered
        a SIM/BOT evaluation. Credit each SIM/BOT evaluation for one flight evaluation.
     2.5.1.4. (Added-AMC) Secondary ASEV Flight Evaluations:
        2.5.1.4.1. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC flight examiners will administer flight
        evaluations to instructors (preferably performing instructor duties) or flight examiners
        (preferably performing flight examiner or instructor duties). Additionally, ASEV
        team members may administer evaluations to any crewmember that is current and
        qualified to fly in unit aircraft and is on the flying schedule. Complete an AF Form 8,
        Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, for all ASEV evaluations. The total number of
        evaluations will be at the discretion of the ASEV team chief.
        2.5.1.4.2. (Added-AMC) Credit may be taken for ASEV evaluations on local and
        off-station SPOT evaluations administered by HQ AMC flight examiners on AMC-
        directed deployment, re-deployment, airlift, AR, Joint Airborne/Air Transportability
        Training (JA/ATT), JOSAC, operational and local training missions within 90 days of
        the designated start date of the ASEV. OG/CC approval is required when conducting
        local or JA/ATT evaluations before the scheduled ASEV for ANG and AFRC
        mobility units.
     2.5.1.5. (Added-AMC) ASEV Requirements:
        2.5.1.5.1. (Added-AMC) ASEV Scheduling/Notification. AMC ASEV teams will
        normally visit units approximately every 40 months for unit-equipped active duty
        units and approximately every 60 months for unit-equipped ANG and AFRC units.
        Associate unit (active duty and ARC) visits will be the same frequency (and usually
        concurrent) with their unit-equipped host unit. Official unit ASEV notification will be
        sent to the unit not less than 90 days prior to the scheduled visit. The notification
        message will include ASEV team composition, transportation requirements, special
        interest items, and other details of the visit. Initial planning dates for unit ASEVs are
        coordinated with AFRC and NGB IG and A3V counterparts, and are published semi-
        annually in the AMC/IG Command-Wide Inspection Schedule and posted on the
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                                 19


        AMC/A3V website. Unit scheduling conflicts should be reported to HQ AMC/A3VS
        for resolution; all changes will be coordinated with the respective MAJCOM, with
        final approval by HQ AMC/A3
        2.5.1.5.2. (Added-AMC) Flight evaluations should represent a cross section of the
        unit's operational mission. Instructors may be asked to demonstrate maneuvers to help
        assess instructor ability. All crewmembers (to include AECM where applicable) may
        be asked to accomplish specific tasks or maneuvers for their crew qualification to
        assess proficiency. ASEV flight evaluations may be administered up to and including
        90 days prior to the beginning of the ASEV.
        2.5.1.5.3. (Added-AMC) ASEV teams will complete all AF IMTs 8 for in-flight
        evaluations before departure. At the unit commander’s discretion, and with ASEV
        evaluator’s approval, evaluations administered by ASEV flight examiners may be
        credited toward periodic evaluation requirements. This request must be made prior to
        the start of the evaluation. Complete remaining ground items within 2 months (AFRC
        and ANG units may use entire eligibility period for the accomplishment of requisites)
        but not later than the end of the eligibility period. For evaluations graded Q-3 refers to
        paragraph 5.2.7.3.2
     2.5.1.6. (Added-AMC) ASEV Grading. A unit-level overall ASEV grade will be
     awarded. At the conclusion of the visit, the ASEV team chief will provide feedback (oral
     or written) to the unit commander and staff. In addition, HQ AMC/A3 or designated
     representative will release an ASEV written report following review/endorsement. ASEV
     teams will identify those areas not in compliance with current guidelines and include as
     ―required improvements‖. Units will report corrective action to AMC/A3V within 90
     days after receiving the final report. This report will be in the form of an official
     memorandum signed by the unit’s operations group commander to HQ AMC/A3V. It
     will provide specifics on what corrective action was taken to resolve each of the
     ―required improvements‖ to bring each of the designated areas into compliance.
     2.5.1.7. (Added-AMC) ASEV Programs. All unit Stan/Eval, Training, Tactics, and
     Aircrew Resource Management System programs are subject to inspection. The
     AMC/A3V ASEV Standards Guide provides additional information and guidance on
     specific programs subject to assessment by the ASEV team. Individual programs will be
     awarded a grade using the following scale:
        2.5.1.7.1. (Added-AMC) Outstanding: Program exceeds all requirements with no
        significant discrepancies.
        2.5.1.7.2. (Added-AMC) Excellent: Program exceeds most requirements with few
        deviations noted.
        2.5.1.7.3. (Added-AMC) Satisfactory: Program meets requirements with some
        deviations noted.
        2.5.1.7.4. (Added-AMC) Marginal: Program meets most requirements with
        significant discrepancies noted.
        2.5.1.7.5. (Added-AMC) Unsatisfactory: Major discrepancies noted that degrade
        program effectiveness.

        2.5.1.8. (Added-AMC) ASEV Results. Approved unit ASEV Reports are posted on HQ
        AMC/A3V website.
     2.5.2. (Added-AMC) Staff Assistance Visits.
        2.5.2.1. (Added-AMC) AMC/A3V (AFRC/A3V for AFRC Units) will conduct
        scheduled Mid Term ASEV Staff Assistance Visits (SAV) at the approximate half-way
        point between ASEVs. Notification of the SAV will be sent to the unit approximately 45
        days prior. SAVs may include any Stan/Eval or training related area the unit requests.
        2.5.2.2. (Added-AMC) AMC/A3V will normally not conduct a SAV in the 6 month
        period prior to a stan/eval inspection.
        2.5.2.3. (Added-AMC) Reports generated by a SAV will be informal (internal use
        only). Results from AFRC SAVs administered IAW paragraph 2.5.2.1 (Added) will be
        briefed to the AFRC A3 and forwarded to HQ AMC/A3V.
     2.5.3. (Added-AMC) Informal Visits. For AMC evaluators visiting AMC units, prior
     coordination for an informal visit is not required. Informal visits to AFRC units other than to
     administer a pyramid evaluation will be coordinated through AFRC A3V. AFRC NAF
     evaluators may perform informal visits within their NAFs with NAF A3 approval. If the
     purpose of visit is other than continuation training or pyramid evals, HHQ evaluators will
     informally in/out-brief with the OG/CC. Reports, if generated, will be informal (for internal
     use only).

         standardized FEF guidance examples. Annex 1 is maintained in the overhead bin at
         the OGV/F desk.
     3.2.2.3. Establish procedures for the Aircrew Examination Program according to
     Chapter 6 and Chapter 8 of this instruction. Document Aircrew Examination Program
     in the unit supplement to this instruction.
     3.2.2.4.     Establish and maintain a trend program.
         3.2.2.4.1.    Scope will include trend analysis of all evaluations.
        3.2.2.4.1. (AMC) Include the following areas in trend analysis (if available):
        open/closed book examination program, evaluations, supplementary evaluation
        program, supervisory observations, and ATS contractor feedback.
        3.2.2.4.1. (934AW) Trend Analysis Sources. The 934 OG/OGV proactively solicits
        feedback from many sources. Trend information should be gathered and evaluated
        from the following areas: examinations, flight evaluations, EPEs, supplementary
        evaluations, supervisory observations and instructor/evaluator meetings.
            3.2.2.4.1.1. (Added-934AW) Trend Analysis Requirements. Trend data should
            be analyzed on a continuous basis by the OG/OGV functional areas to try to
            identify ―Areas of Concern‖ as early as possible and address these concerns with
            corrective action. Areas of concern are areas that if not addressed will likely
            become a trend. Trends are items that 30% or more of the aircrew members are
            doing that need to be corrected.
             3.2.2.4.1.2. (Added-934AW) Trend analysis data will be analyzed on a quarterly
             basis and reported at the ―    Quarterly Instructor/Evaluator Meeting‖. This
             information is used to identify ―  Areas of Concern‖ that the instructors will
             emphasize during student training to address issues before they become a trend.
                3.2.2.4.1.3. (Added-934AW) Trend analysis data will also be analyzed for the
                entire semi-annual period ending in December and June. This information will be
                used to establish ―Tr
                                    ends‖ that will be assigned to an OPR/OCR for action.
                3.2.2.4.1.4. (Added-934AW) Trend analysis data will also be used to ascertain
                the effectiveness of training after a ―
                                                      trend‖ has been identified.
                   3.2.2.4.1.4.1. (Added-934AW) Testing Trends.           Written examination
                   discrepancy areas are recorded and tracked automatically through the PEX
                   Testing Program. For questions on the PEX testing Program see the PEX
                   User Guide. Boldface examination discrepancies will be tabulated under the
                   remarks section of the AF IMT 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification. PEX
                   testing thresholds are 15% of questions missed for areas of concern and 30%
                   of questions missed for trends. The PEX program will track missed questions
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                              23


              to provide necessary trend information. If a trend is noted, analyze the
              question and determine if it is accurate, clearly presented and current. If it is
              not, either update the question using the Bad Test Question Report Form, or
              mark it as a ― N/A‖ in the PEX system. If the question is valid, a training
              deficiency might be indicated. Refer to the Trends continuity book for
              addition information.
              3.2.2.4.1.4.2. (Added-934AW) EPE Trends. EPE discrepancies will be
              annotated on the EPE Evaluation Worksheet by the evaluator performing the
              EPE. EPE discrepancies will be tabulated under the remarks section of the AF
              IMT 8 log.
              3.2.2.4.1.4.3. (Added-934AW) Flight Evaluation Trends. Flight Evaluation
              discrepancies will be annotated on the AF IMT 3862, Flight Evaluation
              Worksheet during the evaluation by the flight examiner. Flight Evaluation
              discrepancies will be tabulated under the remarks section of the AF IMT 8
              log.
              3.2.2.4.1.4.4. (Added-934AW) Supplemental Evaluation Trends.           The
              Supplementary Evaluation Program is an administrative tool used to identify
              and evaluate implemented solutions to operation problems. Supplementary
              evaluation results will be annotated on the Supplementary Evaluation
              Worksheet, and these results will be compiled and interpreted by the OGV
              functional.
          3.2.2.4.1.5. (Added-934AW) Quarterly Instructor/Evaluator Meeting.                A
          meeting will be held quarterly to present the trend analysis data to the instructors
          and evaluators. See meeting template under Tab 3 of Operational Process Guide
          E. Copies of meeting minutes and all related information will be saved on the
          following drive: MSPNT05/OG/OGV/Trends/Sqdn/Instructor meeting. This
          information will be held for a minimum of 1 year.

              the end of the first quarter of the new semi-annual period will be to discuss
              ― Areas of Concern‖, and ways to address these items so they don’t become
              trends. We will also use our trend data to determine whether previous trend
              items have successfully been addressed and can be closed.
              3.2.2.4.1.5.2. (Added-934AW) 2nd Quarter Meeting. The second quarter
              meeting will be held at the end of the second quarter of each semi-annual
              period. This meeting will be held to determine if any trends exist and to
              assign an OPR/OCR to deal with them. We will also use our trend data to
              determine whether previous trend items have successfully been addressed and
              can be closed.
       3.2.2.4.2. For units with more than one type of aircraft, combine discrepancies
       common to all aircraft/aircrews to determine trends (e.g., instrument procedures).
       3.2.2.4.3. For Formal Training Units (FTUs)/Combat Crew Training Squadrons
       (CCTSs), maintain separate trend data for students and qualified/instructor aircrews.
24                         AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009


        3.2.2.4.4. When trends are noted, recommend corrective action and assign an
        OPR/Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR); report trends and status to the
        OG/CC during the SEB until closed. OGV will publish and define the trend program

        OPR/OCR will be assigned to work an action plan. Trend Notification letters, located
        in Operational Process Guide E (TAB 1) will be sent to Training and a suspense date
        will be assigned. The OPR will be given a ―  Trend Notification‖ letter that will have a
        description of the trend and a proposed resolution. These trends will be addressed by
        the OPR. Progress reports will be delivered to OGV monthly and annotated on the
        trend notification letter. Once a trend has been determined to be complete, they will
        be closed out at the semi-annual SEB.
            3.2.2.4.4.1. (Added-934AW) Trend Reporting. Trends will be reported to the

        can be held on an as needed basis. The board will consist of those individuals per the
        R&C Board Appointment Letter located under tab 1 of Operational Process Guide C.
        3.3.2.8.2. (Added-934AW) R&C Board Procedure. Prepare R&C Board outline
        using the minutes format from the 934 AW R&C Minutes Template. AF IMT 4025,
        Aircrew Summary/Close-Out Report that need to be briefed will be provided by 96
        AS/DOT after training is complete. Ensure all training events completed are briefed
        to the commander and then annotated in the minutes even if certification board action
        is not required. Individuals that are being recommended for upgrade should be
        discussed prior to this meeting amongst the senior leadership and instructors during
        the monthly instructor meetings conducted by each crew position. R&C Board items
        also cover some events required by the training review panel (TRP). Training will
        generate their own minutes based on their requirements. A separate TRP is not
        normally accomplished. Commander/DO will preside at all R&C Boards. The board
        president will interview aircrew members meeting the certification board.
            3.3.2.8.2.1. (Added-934AW) The certification board process normally begins
            with an AF IMT 4025 from Squadron DOT. The board may also be convened at
            the request of any supervisor with the commander’s concurrence.
               3.3.2.8.2.1.1. (Added-934AW) The board agenda will consist of those items
               per the Review and Certification Board Minutes Template. All pertinent
               information (i.e. AF IMT 8, training folder, administrative documentation)
               will be present to the board president with a brief synopsis for each event.
        3.3.2.8.3. (Added-934AW) The board will discuss each case as presented prior to
        inviting the individual into the formal proceedings. Once discussion is complete, the
        individual will be called in before the board and introduced by the senior like
        specialty crewmember. The board president will commence with his comments and
        each board member will follow as directed. Pertinent aspects of the unit’s mission
        including special items of emphasis should be discussed with the individual. Use of
        aircrew interview suggested topics under Tab 3 of Operational Process Guide C, to
        conduct the interview is recommended. After the board is complete, the individual
        will be released. This process will occur for each subsequent interview.
        3.3.2.8.4. (Added-934AW) Following the R&C Board: Compose minutes per AF
        template, located under Tab 2 of Operational Process Guide C, - file electronically:

                                           Chapter 4

                                    FLIGHT EXAMINERS

4.1. General. The evaluation portion of the Aircrew Stan/Eval Program is administered by
flight examiners at both the HHQ and unit levels.
4.2. Selection.
     4.2.1. Select Flight Examiners from the most highly qualified and experienced instructors.
     EXCEPTION: Senior flight examiners are selected IAW paragraph 4.2.3
        4.2.1.1. (Added-934AW) Candidates for 934 OG/OGV can be recommended by the
        respective SQ/CCs. The chief of 934 OG/OGV may provide additional comments on
        nominees, as required. Candidates are approved by 934 OG/CC. Once selected as a
        candidate, 934 OG/OGV will be responsible for ensuring all training is documented and
        completed within 120 days of being entered into upgrade. OG/CC may waive the
        requirement for flights if the individual was previously qualified as an evaluator.
        4.2.1.2. (Added-934AW) Candidates for squadron flight examiner duties will be
        selected and approved by the respective squadron commander via the TRB/R&C
        process. Once selected as a candidate, 934 OG/OGV will be responsible for ensuring all
        training is documented and completed within 120 days of being entered into upgrade.
        The 934 OG/OGV will advise OG/CC, as needed, on status of potential candidates.
        Flight examiner candidate training will be accomplished in accordance with the Flight
        Examiner Certification Checklist located in attachment 1 to this supplement.
        4.2.1.3. (Added-934AW) The first flight evaluation administered by the new Flight
        Examiner should be observed by OGV via a Spot evaluation. If not, then a Spot
        evaluation will be administered at the earliest convenience.
     4.2.2. The chief of the respective MAJCOM or NAF stan/eval function will select HHQ
     flight examiners. EXCEPTION: Senior flight examiners are selected IAW paragraph 4.2.3
     4.2.3. Senior flight examiner eligibility is defined as flying commanders at the NAF and
     OG levels. Vice commanders (NAF/CV) may perform this function if the principal
     incumbent is not qualified or not available. This eligibility includes deputy commanders at
     the OG level (OG/CD) in multi-MDS wings where the OG/CC and the OG/CD fly different
     aircraft. In single-MDS wings, deputies may perform this function if the principal incumbent
     is not qualified or not available.
     4.2.4. The OG/CC will select, and designate in writing, all OGV flight examiners. Selection
     and designation will be annotated in the unit certification document, recorded in ARMS and
     reported in SEB minutes ( Attachment 2).
        4.2.4.1. (Added-934AW) Flight Examiner Certification Procedures and Program.
            4.2.4.1.1. (Added-934AW) Flight examiner candidates will comply with AFI 11-
            202V2, AMCSUP1 and this supplement. All examiner candidates will complete the
            934 OG Flight Examiner Upgrade Checklist (Attachment 10).
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                                   39


    4.2.5. The squadron commander will select, and designate in writing, squadron flight
    examiners. Selection and designation will be annotated in the unit certification document,
    recorded in ARMS and reported in SEB minutes ( Attachment 2).
    4.2.5. (AMC) Unit certification document is Letter of X’s replacing the use of 1381/4348s.
    The Letter of X’s is populated by signed AF IMT 4324s. See attachment for sample letter of
    X’s.
    4.2.6. For AFRC and ANG units:
        4.2.6.1.   The Air Force advisor may be designated as a flight examiner.
        4.2.6.2. Air Technician (AT)/Air Reserve Technician (ART) /Active Guard and
        Reserve (AGR) serving in a military position that does not require maintaining mission
        ready/combat mission ready (MR/CMR) status may perform duties as a flight examiner.
        4.2.6.3. (Added-AMC) For AFRC and ANG units, one alternate flight examiner may be
        designated to administer flight evaluations in the absence of the senior evaluator.
        4.2.6.4. (Added-AMC) Associate units establish an OG Stan/Eval under the OG/CC or
        equivalent. The duties and responsibilities associated with Host Wing OG Stan/Eval
        apply except the Host OGV manages common areas for both Host and Associate Wings
        or Squadrons, e.g., Flight Crew Information File (FCIF), Flight Crew Bulletin (FCB), and
        requisite examinations. This does not preclude the Associate OGV from managing
        Associate unit-unique FCIFs or developing examinations to meet unit requirements.
        4.2.6.5. (Added-AMC) All Air Technician/Active Guard Reserve (AT/AGR) and Air
        Reserve Technicians (ART) may be flight examiner qualified. ART personnel should
        occupy senior evaluator positions. For all aircrew positions, when a non-technician fills a
        Stan/Eval Unit Manning Document (UMD) position, units may assign a technician in that
        crew position to the Stan/Eval division. In this case, the technician will assume the duties
        of the senior evaluator for that crew position and may administer all evaluations.
        4.2.6.6. (Added-AMC) AFRC OG flight examiners may evaluate aircrew counterparts
        in both their OG and host active duty OG.
4.3.   Functions. Flight Examiners:
    4.3.1. Conduct flight and EP evaluations as required.
    4.3.2. Maintain qualification as instructors. EXCEPTION: Not required for senior flight
    examiners.
   4.3.3. Maintain MR/CMR status as defined in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 1 AFIs,
   MDS XX - Aircrew Training. EXCEPTIONS: FTU, HHQ, senior flight examiners, and
   HHQ-designated test/evaluation units must maintain at least Basic Mission Capable (BMC)
   status.
   4.3.4. Administer evaluations only within their aircrew specialty/weapon system and will
   only evaluate those missions in which they maintain qualification. EXCEPTION: SPOT
   evaluations and where specifically authorized in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2.
   MAJCOMs may establish procedures for flight examiners to administer evaluations outside
   of NAF/unit.
40                              AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009


     4.3.4. (AMC) Unit-level flight examiners will only administer SPOT evaluations within
     their respective MDS and crew position unless directed by OG/CC.
     4.3.5. Conduct a thorough pre-mission briefing and post-mission debriefing for the
     examinee and applicable aircrew members on all aspects of the evaluation.
     4.3.6. Immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline during an
     evaluation (this applies to all aircrew members). If this situation occurs, the flight examiner
     will also debrief unit supervision, as designated in the unit supplement, and if appropriate,
     document the deviation on an AF Form 8/8a.
        4.3.6.1. (Added-AMC) The flight examiner normally does not assume the examinee's
        position for unsatisfactory performance. If warranted, the flight examiner may assume the
        duties of that crew member, if current and qualified. Advise the crew and assume full
        responsibility for the crew position for the rest of the mission leg. In the mobility system,
        evaluators will notify the mission execution authority immediately and coordinate follow-
        on action (replacement, if required). The evaluator should be prepared to continue follow-
        on missions if directed by the execution authority.
        4.3.6.2. (Added-AMC) If, in the examiner's judgment, the examinee can continue
        safely (under supervision) the flight examiner should not assume the examinee's duties.
        4.3.6.3. (Added-AMC) Flight examiners performing in-flight duties and not qualified
        and current for the crew position in which unsatisfactory performance is observed (non-
        specialty) will inform the aircraft commander immediately.
     4.3.7. Immediately notify the examinee’s squadron commander/operations officer and
     flight commander whenever Qualification Level 2 or 3 (―
                                                           Q-2‖ or ―
                                                                   Q-3‖) performance is
     observed.
     4.3.7. (AMC) When a flight examiner observes less than Qualification Level ―           Q-1‖
     performance from any crew-member not being evaluated, the flight examiner will consult
     with appropriate qualified personnel and (through the Chief, OGV) will complete a follow-on
     recommendation for appropriate action to the unit commander (e.g., commander directed
     downgrade, follow-on N/N evaluation, additional training, etc.). The unit commander will
     determine the final course-of-action in accordance with ―  commander-directed downgrade‖
     procedures.
     4.3.8. Will not administer evaluations outside of their MAJCOM unless specifically
     requested by the MAJCOM stan/eval organization of the examinee and approved by the
     MAJCOM stan/eval organization of the examiner.
     4.3.8. (AMC) Active duty and Reserve OG/OGV flight examiners may evaluate aircrew
     counterparts in both their OG and their Associate OG. Squadron or Detachment Flight
     examiners may administer evaluations outside their unit, with the approval of the examinee's
     squadron commander.
     4.3.9. (Added-AMC) Formal Training Units (FTU)/CCTS evaluators may evaluate AMC
     and AMC-gained aircrew members at formal schools or as augmentees to ASEVs.
     4.3.10. (Added-AMC) For en route evaluations, flight examiner pilots may, at their
     discretion, serve as an augmented crewmember during evaluations, but should not occupy a
     pilot seat for takeoff and landing.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                             41


4.4. Senior Flight Examiner Program.
   4.4.1. Flying NAF/CCs and OG/CCs may maintain flight examiner status in their primary
   assigned aircraft. Vice commanders and deputies may perform this function if the principal
   incumbent is not qualified or available.
   4.4.2. NAF/CCs, OG/CCs, and OG/CDs that fly different aircraft from the OG/CC in
   multi-MDS wings, do not require, nor do they have to maintain, instructor certification or
   MR/CMR status. To become a flight examiner, NAF/CCs, OG/CCs, and applicable OG/CDs,
   must maintain BMC status and be flight examiner certified. For other than SPOT evaluations,
   Senior Flight Examiners will evaluate only events for which they are current and at a level
   for which they are qualified.
4.5. Aircrew positions that do not require a flight phase evaluation do not require flight
examiners.

                                            Chapter 5

                                        EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes three types of evaluations to ensure
qualification of aircrew members and standardization of operations. Aircrew qualification
evaluations are administered periodically and documented on the AF Forms 8/8a to ensure
aircrew qualification. EPEs are requisites for some aircrew qualification evaluations.
Supplementary evaluations are unstructured tools to be used by the commander to ensure
standardization of flying and other operations.
5.2. Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. Aircrew qualification evaluations consist of two
structured phases, ground and flight. Each phase requires the completion of requisite tasks. The
ground phase, when required, includes a series of examinations and evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment. The flight phase includes an
inflight or, if applicable, simulator evaluation of aircrew performance. EXCEPTION: For
specialized aircrew qualified IAW Universal Qualification guidance see paragraph 5.2.18
     5.2.1. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Categories. There are five types of aircrew
     qualification evaluations. Periodic aircrew qualification evaluations are administered to
     ensure basic qualification in the MDS and crew position of an aircrew member (QUAL),
     qualification to operate in instrument meteorological conditions (INSTM, when applicable)
     and qualification to employ the MDS of the aircrew member in accomplishing the unit’s
     operational mission (MSN). Evaluations are accomplished to ensure aircrew are certified and
     maintain instructor qualification (INSTR). Evaluation and certification of specific aircrew
     performance may also be accomplished (SPOT). Aircrew will complete the following types
     of aircrew certification evaluations as appropriate:
        5.2.1.1. QUAL Evaluations. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in
        their primary assigned aircraft, to include requisites, as specified in the applicable AFI
        11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
        5.2.1.2. INSTM Evaluations.           All Air Force pilots (and other pilots flying
        operationally with the Air Force, e.g., exchange pilots) will maintain instrument
        qualification. EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI
        11-401, Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft
        pilots; USAFA T-41 and T-51 pilots. Note: Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may
        also be assigned to other aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument
        qualification in non-excepted aircraft. To obtain/maintain instrument qualification, pilots
        must successfully complete a periodic INSTM evaluation.
            5.2.1.2.1. A commander may revoke the instrument qualification of any pilot under
            his/her command who fails to maintain minimum instrument flying skills. To revoke
            an instrument qualification for reasons not related to an evaluation, use the
            procedures in Chapter 7 for a commander-directed downgrade.
            5.2.1.2.2. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification may not fly as
            a pilot in aircraft in which instrument qualification is required except in a training
            program leading to requalification. Pilots in this situation must be in supervised
            status. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed in paragraph 5.2.1.2)
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                                  43


     5.2.1.3. MSN Evaluations. All aircrew members maintaining MR/CMR or BMC
     aircrew status will complete a periodic MSN evaluation in their primary assigned aircraft,
     to include requisites, as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
     The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required in the
     performance of normal operational and training sorties. The requirement for a MSN
     evaluation may be waived for those aircraft where performance of normal operational,
     test and training sorties involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM
     and/or QUAL evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2. QUAL and
     MSN evaluations may be combined into a single evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2
     MDS-Specific Volumes 2.
     5.2.1.4. INSTR Evaluations. Aircrew members maintaining instructor qualification in
     a particular MDS aircraft must complete initial and periodic evaluations of instructional
     capability in that MDS aircraft. Specialized qualified, universally qualified, or multiple
     qualified aircrew maintaining instructor qualification in multiple similar aircraft will
     accomplish initial and periodic evaluations as specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or
     AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2.
        5.2.1.4.1. To initially qualify as an instructor in a particular MDS aircraft, the
        aircrew member must successfully complete an initial instructor (INIT INSTR)
        evaluation. Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions
        whenever possible. When students are not available or mission requirements/crew
        composition requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the
        evaluator may serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s
        instructional ability.
        5.2.1.4.2. Periodic evaluation of the ability of aircrew members to instruct will be
        conducted during all subsequent periodic evaluations. The AF Form 8/8a
        Mission/Check description for these periodic evaluations will not include INSTR as
        the AF Form 8/8a aircraft/crew position is already annotated with highest
        qualification demonstrated during the previous evaluation (e.g. IB, IN, IP).
        5.2.1.4.3. If instructor qualification is lost in an MDS aircraft, it may be regained
        through an instructor requalification evaluation (see paragraphs 5.2.3.2.2 and
        5.2.3.2.4) as directed in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1.
        5.2.1.4.4. (Added-AMC) The flight evaluator will determine the evaluatee's seat
        position (normally right seat) for the initial instructor pilot evaluation and will include
        a minimum of one approach and landing.
     5.2.1.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional). A SPOT evaluation is an
     evaluation not intended to satisfy the requirements of a periodic evaluation (e.g., INSTM,
     QUAL, MSN or INSTR). SPOT evaluations have no specific requisites or requirements,
     unless specified in MAJCOM supplements. An evaluation that begins as a SPOT
     evaluation may become (and be documented as) a required periodic evaluation if all
     required flight phase requirements are completed during the SPOT eval and the examinee
     subsequently completes all ground phase requirements for the evaluation within the
     periods described in paragraph 5.2.7 Do not add on missions (flights) to complete the
     requirements for a periodic evaluation unless the group/squadron commander concurs
     with the aircrew member’s desire to realign the evaluation expiration date and approves
44                             AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009


        the additional flight time requirements. Evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1 -
        5.2.1.4 will be documented as SPOT evaluations. Note: When the flight examiner
        administering a SPOT evaluation is not qualified in the MDS and same crew position of
        the examinee, the evaluation will not be credited towards a periodic evaluation.
        5.2.1.5. (AMC) SPOT Evaluations. Examinee must receive notification before entering
        pre-mission or pre-departure crew rest. The unit's (90-day prior) ASEV notification
        message satisfies this requirement. Crewmembers should not receive more than one
        SPOT evaluation per calendar year. EXCEPTION: As directed by the commander, or as
        directed by AMC/A3V to meet ASEV evaluation requirements.
     5.2.2. Combined Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. To promote efficient use of flying
     resources, accomplish evaluations concurrently, whenever practical. If combined, include the
     designation of each evaluation in the Flight Phase of the AF Form 8, e.g., QUAL/MSN or
     INSTM/QUAL/MSN. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM
     supplements.
     5.2.2. (AMC) Combined Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. If in-flight evaluations
     (e.g. QUAL and MSN) cannot be completed within the same calendar month, use a separate
     AF FORM 8 with a separate expiration date or as specified in AFI 11-2MDS-Specific
     Volume 2.
     5.2.3. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used,
     when applicable, to further describe the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1 - 5.2.1.5:
        5.2.3.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for a crew position or instructor
        qualification in an MDS (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT MSN, INIT INSTR).
        5.2.3.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
        qualification due to expiration of a required periodic evaluation, loss of currency, a flight
        recheck following a failed periodic evaluation (see paragraph 7.3.9 for ground rechecks),
        or loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade.
            5.2.3.2.1. When loss of qualification is for expiration of a required periodic
            evaluation, the evaluation given will be IAW the guidance for that periodic
            evaluation. The AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an
            RQ prefix. Note: When expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure
            to complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.2.4), the
            flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period for an
            in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in paragraph 5.2.7.2 for
            an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, and the OG/CC determines that
            qualification will be re-established by completion of the ground requisites without re-
            accomplishment of the flight evaluation or completed ground requisites as outlined in
            paragraph 5.2.16, the AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will not be
            documented with an RQ prefix.
            5.2.3.2.2. When loss of qualification is due to loss of currency, the evaluation
            profile will be as directed by the squadron commander and will include, as a
            minimum, those items for which the individual is non-current. The AF Form 8/8a
            Mission/Check description will be documented with RQ SPOT.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                             45


        5.2.3.2.3. When loss of qualification is for failure to pass a flight evaluation, the
        recheck evaluation will be IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.2.13 The AF Form
        8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT,
        as applicable.
        5.2.3.2.4. When loss of qualification is due to a commander-directed downgrade
        (see paragraph 7.4.8), the evaluation profile will be as directed by the commander.
        The AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix
        or RQ SPOT, as applicable.
        5.2.3.2.5. Do not use RQ to prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
        qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
        5.2.3.2.6. When requalification deals with instructor capability, the AF Form 8/8a
        Mission/Check description will be documented with RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
     5.2.3.3. No-Notice (N/N). A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified
     of the evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. The
     beginning of normal preparation for a mission will be determined by the flight examiner
     and may be defined in supplements to this instruction. The intent is to preclude
     extraordinary preparation for the mission.
        5.2.3.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
        daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
            5.2.3.3.1.1. (Added-AMC) N/N In-flight Evaluation Program. Each level of
            command (SQ/OG/AMC) will execute a N/N program. Develop the N/N program
            as an assessment tool for overall unit readiness and to provide indicators for
            appraisal and re-focusing unit training programs. OG and SQ levels will develop
            and publish a program to sample a combined minimum goal of 15% of available
            (qualified to perform aircrew duties) crewmembers (by crew position) annually. If
            a unit has less than five crewmembers in a given crew position, N/N goal is at the
            commander’s discretion.
            5.2.3.3.1.1. (934AW) The 934 OG no-notice goal is a minimum of 15% of
            eligible crewmembers annually. To achieve this goal, as well as adequately
            sample aircrew performance, we encourage a rate of approximately 4% per
            quarter. Use the no-notice tracking sheet to help ensure you are meeting your
            required goals.
            5.2.3.3.1.2. (Added-AMC) Crewmembers will not receive more than one N/N
            evaluation per calendar year except as directed by their commander. This
            restriction does not affect HQ AMC or AFRC/NAF evaluators conducting N/N
            evaluations in the mobility system or SPOT evaluations in conjunction with unit
            ASEV requirements. Evaluators in the mobility system may conduct only one
            N/N evaluation per crew-member (maximum) per mission.
            5.2.3.3.1.2. (934AW) An annual N/N flight evaluation tracking sheet will be
            posted in the Operational Process Guide F (Tab 1), to help ensure individuals are
            not assigned more than one N/N annually. Check this tracking sheet and the
            individuals FEF to ensure a N/N evaluation has not been given in the last 12
46                  AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009


     months. An electronic version of the N/N flight evaluation tracking sheet is
     located on the following drive: OG/OGV/934 OGV process guides/no-notice.
     5.2.3.3.1.3. (Added-AMC) Avoid administering N/N evaluations within the
     eligibility period unless commander directed.
     5.2.3.3.1.3. (934AW) When crewmember’s are in their eligibility window, they
     have a temporary flight evaluation folder (TFEF) built with their eligibility period
     displayed on the cover page. The OGV representative is responsible for ensuring
     individuals scheduled for an N/N evaluation are not in their eligibility window by
     checking for a TFEF folder. PEX also displays who is in their eligibility period
     and is a back-up to ensure they are not scheduled in their eligibility period
     5.2.3.3.1.4. (Added-AMC) For mobility aircrews, as a minimum, all N/N
     evaluations will include items designated under ― General‖ as defined in the
     appropriate aircrew member’s chapter of the AFI 11-2MDS-Spe-cific Volume 2.
     Evaluate other areas, as appropriate.
     5.2.3.3.1.4. (934AW) After scheduling a no-notice evaluation, build a TFEF and
     place an AF IMT 3862 in it for the evaluator to fill out during the evaluation.
     Flight evaluators will evaluate, at a minimum, items designated under ―    General‖
     of the AF IMT 3862, Special Interest Items, and the instructing abilities of
     instructors. Evaluators will use the special interest program to target and assess
     specific areas during all N/N evaluations. Areas designated ―  special interest‖ are
     described in the 934 OGV Special Interest Area Process Guide. Evaluators will
     be familiar with the special interest items in this guide and will evaluate them on
     every evaluation.
     5.2.3.3.1.5. (Added-AMC) Evaluators will use items from the special interest
     program to target and assess specific areas during all N/N evaluations. Areas
     designated "special interest" are normally identified by higher headquarters
     message. OG and squadron may also designate areas. Squadron and OG will
     provide feedback on special interest areas through the SEB. Squadron, OG, and
     HQ AMC will develop a process to inform evaluators on the requirements of the
     special interest program.
     5.2.3.3.1.5. (934AW) Once a N/N evaluation has been administered, all trend
     and evaluation information will be processed in the same manner as a normal
     evaluation. The individual producing the AF IMT 8 will write in the name and
     date of the individual receiving the N/N evaluation on the N/N flight evaluation
     tracking sheet.
     5.2.3.3.1.6. (Added-AMC) Detail the unit's N/N program (including N/N rate
     goal) in the unit supplement.
     5.2.3.3.1.6. (934AW) The 934 OGV, in coordination with the OG/CC and
     respective squadron commanders, will conduct the No-Notice (N/N) Evaluation
     Program.
        5.2.3.3.1.6.1. (Added-934AW) Crewmembers can anticipate                 a   N/N
        evaluation at any time a flight is generated by the 934 OG.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                                   47


                5.2.3.3.1.7. (Added-934AW) The N/N program progress will be reported and
                documented during semi-annual SEB. Additionally, progress toward the unit goal
                will be monitored and reported during the instructor meeting on each UTA.
         5.2.3.3.2. An examinee may utilize a no-notice evaluation to update a
         QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
         evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.2.7 If all
         requirements were not completed on the first flight, subsequent flights are authorized
         to complete required events. If the examinee elects not to update a
         QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date, the evaluation will be documented
         as a N/N SPOT evaluation.
         5.2.3.3.2. (AMC) Before the start of a N/N evaluation and with the concurrence of
         the evaluator, the examinee may request that items accomplished during the
         evaluation be credited toward a periodic evaluation. Do not add on missions (flights)
         to complete the requirements for a periodic evaluation unless the group/ squadron
         commander concurs with the aircrew member’s desire to realign the evaluation
         expiration date and approves the additional flight time requirements.
     5.2.3.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
     in a simulator.
     5.2.3.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an
     evaluation (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any
     combined evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes will be explained under Mission
     Description in the Examiner’s Remarks (see paragraphs 7.3.7.3 and 7.4.7.3).
  5.2.4. Ground Phase Requisites. The ground phase for periodic aircrew evaluations
  includes requisites listed below. See Chapter 6 of this instruction for additional guidance on
  aircrew examinations.
     5.2.4.1. QUAL Evaluations. Open book examination, closed book examination,
     Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
     5.2.4.1. (AMC) QUAL Evaluations. Publications Check. Each aircrew member,
     while performing aircrew duties, is responsible for assigned publications according to the
     appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 3. For aircrew members participating in the
     Electronic Publications program, the publications review conducted as part of an
     evaluation will include a check for currency. The evaluatee will demonstrate ability to
     navigate through and locate information in the electronic media. The evaluatee will
     demonstrate ability to locate information in paper publications required for in-flight use
     (i.e. checklists, publications kits, etc). If during the flight evaluation the publications are
     checked IAW AFI 11-215, this will suffice for the annual review. In this case the flight
     examiner will sign the AF IMT 1522.
     5.2.4.2.     INSTM Evaluations. Instrument examination.
     5.2.4.3.     MSN Evaluations. As specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
  5.2.5. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
  in the MDS or, if applicable, a suitable simulator profile that will allow evaluation of aircrew
  performance. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
48                              AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009


     appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, and allow
     accurate measure of the proficiency of the examinee. Evaluation profiles will reflect unit
     tasking, daily training missions, be realistic, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the
     unit mission.
     5.2.6. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
        5.2.6.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the
        17th month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a
        periodic evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 04 expires on 31
        Mar 06.).
        5.2.6.1. (934AW) Eligibility Period Notification. 934 OG/OGV will notify aircrew that
        they have entered their eligibility period for a specific evaluation using the PEX e-Mail
        Notification System or by printing a notification letter and placing it in the individual’s
        mailbox. This letter will also inform the individual of their responsibility for completion
        of the requisite examinations.
        5.2.6.2. Scheduling. Schedule periodic evaluations in the eligibility period (six-month
        period prior to expiration date).
        5.2.6.3. Extended Evaluations. Periodic evaluations may be extended on a case-by-
        case basis according to the following criteria:
            5.2.6.3.1. Squadron Commander-Extended Evaluations. Squadron commanders
            may extend the expiration date of periodic evaluations up to three months for the
            reasons listed below.
                5.2.6.3.1.1.   Individuals assigned PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
                5.2.6.3.1.2.   Individuals departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft
                type.
                5.2.6.3.1.3.   Individuals undergoing unit aircraft conversion.
                5.2.6.3.1.4. Individual removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or
                retirement from the Service).
                5.2.6.3.1.5. Individuals participating in real world operations (to include
                operations other than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required
                flight evaluation(s) before or during deployment. This will be on a case-by-case
                basis and is not authority to grant blanket extensions for scheduled operational
                deployments.
            5.2.6.3.2. For squadron commanders and above, the approval authority is the next
            commander in the member’s flying chain of command, with the concurrence of the
            member’s immediate supervisor, IAW the guidance provided in paragraph 5.2.6.3.1
            For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O is the approval authority.
            5.2.6.3.3. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O may authorize the
            extension of expiration dates of periodic aircrew qualification evaluations.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                              49


         5.2.6.3.4. Documentation. Document extensions with a memorandum for record
         (MFR) placed in Section II of the FEF specifying extension authority, the new
         expiration date, and include a brief description of the extension.
             5.2.6.3.4.1. Extension MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any
             affected periodic evaluation.
             5.2.6.3.4.2.   File the MFR on top of the affected AF Form 8/8a in Section II of
             the FEF.
             5.2.6.3.4.3. Requisites not completed during original eligibility period must be
             completed prior to extended expiration date indicated on the MFR.
             5.2.6.3.4.4. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
             AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments,
             when action is complete and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record
             become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed
             by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a. Example: If an
             evaluation was extended based on an HHQ waiver, an MFR will remain in the
             FEF until such time as the next evaluation is completed. That waiver reference is
             commented on in para D of the Form 8/8a.
     5.2.6.4. Requirements Before Permanent Change of Station/Temporary Duty. If a
     periodic evaluation will expire within three months after the proposed departure for a
     Permanent Change of Station (PCS) to a flying assignment in the same aircraft MDS, or
     during an upcoming Temporary Duty (TDY) (flying or non-flying), complete the
     required evaluation(s) before departing for either the PCS flying assignment or the TDY.
     Obtain a MAJCOM stan/eval waiver for unusual situations.
  5.2.7. Requisite Completion. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the
  requirements of combined evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
  Requisites from a completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations provided
  they cover all required areas and are within the requisite zone for each evaluation. See also
  paragraph 5.3.1. For aircrew possessing multiple instrument qualifications, the instrument
  exam may count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs for each
  evaluation IAW the provisions of paragraphs 5.2.7.1 and 5.2.7.2 For all evaluations,
  accomplish requisites as follows:
     5.2.7.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
     the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the six-month eligibility
     period prior to the expiration date of the current evaluation period to update that
     expiration date.
     5.2.7.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations outside the eligibility
     period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period encompassing the
     month in which the flight evaluation was administered. EXCEPTION: For extended
     evaluations, requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
     eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
     5.2.7.3.   Recheck. For evaluations used to remedy a failed evaluation:
50                             AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009


            5.2.7.3.1. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.2.7.1 or
            5.2.7.2 remain valid, IAW paragraph 5.2.13.1
            5.2.7.3.2. Requisite completion dates from the Q-3 AF Form 8/8a will not be
            annotated on the recheck AF Form 8/8a. The recheck AF Form 8/8a will only include
            documentation of the flight phase evaluation.
            5.2.7.3.2. (AMC) In the event a recheck for a flight evaluation is completed prior
            to completion of all ground requisites, the individual must complete the requisites for
            the initial evaluation before the Re-Qual is administered.
     5.2.8. Alternate Means of Evaluation. When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not
     possible, the area may be evaluated verbally or in an Aircrew Training Device (ATD). Flight
     examiners will make every effort to evaluate all required areas in-flight before resorting to
     this option. See the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, for areas prohibited from
     verbal/ATD evaluation.
     5.2.8. (AMC) Alternate Means of Evaluation. Do not verbally evaluate takeoffs,
     instrument approaches, landings, aerial refueling contacts, cargo loads or nursing care
     standards unless specified in the AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 2.
     5.2.9. Evaluation Criteria Source. The MAJCOM designated as lead command in AFPD
     10-9, in coordination with other user commands, will establish and maintain standardized
     INSTM, INSTR, MSN and QUAL evaluation criteria in the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-
     Specific Volume 2. The lead command is responsible for coordinating the establishment of:
        5.2.9.1. Areas/subareas to be used for documenting required evaluations including
        those required and critical for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be
        arranged into general and specific evaluation areas. Where required, mission
        areas/subareas will be further subdivided into general and specific mission areas.
        5.2.9.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Check. This is required for QUAL
        evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
            5.2.9.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for required flight publications as
            outlined in applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific series publications.
            5.2.9.2.2. Satisfactory performance requires individual flight publications be current
            and properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
            members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
            required for the mission.
        5.2.9.3. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM) evaluation criteria in the
        appropriate areas/subareas. Use AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management
        Training Program, and MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
        5.2.9.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS)
        rules and procedures. Must specifically ensure compliance with minimum safe
        maneuvering speeds below 10,000 ft MSL and NAS awareness in all areas of mission
        planning and flight operations.
     5.2.10. Grading System. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and document
     aircrew performance. On one level, individual scores are recorded for examinations while
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                               51


  areas/subareas of aircrew performance are individually graded against established evaluation
  criteria. Performance less than fully qualified is documented. On the second level, an overall
  qualification level is determined from the compilation of these individual scores/grades.
     5.2.10.1. Area/Subarea Grades. AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 will establish
     areas and subareas to be evaluated during emergency procedure and other evaluations - to
     include the appropriate grading criteria for those areas/subareas. Areas/subareas will have
     a two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system. Discrepancies will be
     documented against the listed subareas.
         5.2.10.1.1. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a
         satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within
         the prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
         5.2.10.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned
         area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the
         flight examiner. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the
         prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety.
         5.2.10.1.3. U indicates a breach of flight discipline, performance outside allowable
         parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely
         affected mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee
         receiving an area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in
         the judgment of the flight examiner, additional training will not constructively
         improve examinee’s performance, it is not required. In this case, the flight examiner
         must thoroughly debrief the examinee.
     5.2.10.2. Critical Area. The lead MAJCOM is responsible for the establishment of
     evaluation areas that, upon failure, would most adversely affect the qualification of an
     aircrew member. Critical areas include, but are not limited to, Airmanship, Flight
     Discipline                 and                Safety.           Grade                 all
     critical areas as either Qualified (Q) or Unqualified (U).
     5.2.10.3. Qualification Levels. EPEs and overall evaluation performance are graded
     by qualification levels as follows:
         5.2.10.3.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The aircrew member demonstrated
         desired performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within
         tolerances specified in the grading criteria. This will be awarded when no
         discrepancies were noted, and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
             5.2.10.3.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any
             area(s)/subarea(s).
             5.2.10.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies
             preclude awarding of an overall Qualification Level 1.
             5.2.10.3.1.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during
             the debrief of that evaluation.
         5.2.10.3.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The aircrew member demonstrated the
         ability to perform duties safely, but:
52                             AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009


               5.2.10.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional
               training was assigned.
               5.2.10.3.2.2.   A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
               5.2.10.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based
               on performance in one or several areas/subareas.
           5.2.10.3.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The aircrew member demonstrated an
           unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge.
           5.2.10.3.3. (AMC) Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). Any requisite examination
           resulting in a failure to meet the minimum passing grade IAW para. 6.4.3.1 will
           result in an overall Q-3. After successful re-examination IAW para. 6.4.6, the overall
           qualification level will be annotated as ―3/1‖ in the qualified block on the AF FORM
           8 (and AF IMT 942, Record of Evaluation).
               5.2.10.3.3.1. An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires an overall Q-
               3 for the evaluation.
               5.2.10.3.3.2. An overall Q-3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight
               examiner, there is justification based on performance in one or several
               areas/subareas.
        5.2.10.4. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs examinations as either Qualified (Q)
        or Unqualified (U).
        5.2.10.5. Written, Computer Based, or Electronic Examinations. Grade written,
        computer based, or electronic examinations as a percentage of correct answers. See
        paragraph 6.4.4.1 for minimum passing grade criteria.
     5.2.11. Grading Policies.
        5.2.11.1. Requisite Examinations. The flight examiner will consider performance on
        requisite examinations in assigning the overall qualification level.
        5.2.11.2. Performance Areas/Subareas. Use the two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-
        /U) grading system when applying the grading criteria definitions specified in the
        applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, to grade areas/subareas.
           5.2.11.2.1. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as ―required‖ in
           the general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
           Volume 2.
           5.2.11.2.2. The flight examiner will grade any area/subarea observed during an
           evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts the specific evaluation
           accomplished or flight safety.
           5.2.11.2.3. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft
           conditions.
           5.2.11.2.4. Minor momentary deviations from grading criteria tolerances are
           acceptable, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such
           deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider cumulative deviations when
           determining the overall area/subarea grade.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                              53


        5.2.11.2.5. The flight examiner may further identify an area/sub-area as
        ―Commendable‖ if, in the examiner’s determination, the aircrew member has
        demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in that particular area/sub-area.
        Document commendable areas in the examiner’s remarks section of the AF Form
        8/8a.
     5.2.11.3.   Overall Qualification Levels.
        5.2.11.3.1. The overall qualification level awarded on an evaluation is based on
        performance during both the flight and ground phases. An overall grade of Q-1 or Q-
        2 will be awarded only after all evaluation requirements have been completed and
        given due consideration. An overall grade of Q-3 may be awarded at any time.
        5.2.11.3.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the aircrew member must
        satisfy the criteria set forth in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, and
        demonstrate ability to operate the aircraft and/or equipment safely and effectively
        during all phases of an evaluation.
        5.2.11.3.3. Overall qualification grades will be a cumulative process. While AFI 11-
        2 MDS Specific Volume 2 guidance may dictate the highest grade for a flight or EPE
        based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will always be the
        determining factor in deciding the overall qualification level.
     5.2.11.4. Exceptionally Qualified Designation.                 An exceptionally qualified
     designation may be awarded by the flight examiner. The designation can only be applied
     to the total evaluation - not to separate requisites. The designation may be awarded when:
        5.2.11.4.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge
        in all phases of the evaluation;
        5.2.11.4.2.   The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
        5.2.11.4.3. The aircrew member received a qualified grade with no remedial action
        on all areas/subareas evaluated during emergency procedures and flight evaluations.
  5.2.12. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or less require action to remedy the
  discrepancy and/or deficiency in performance. Remedial action includes debriefing
  discrepancies and/or assignment of additional training. See paragraph 5.2.13 when
  discrepancies result in failure to pass a flight evaluation.
     5.2.12.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the
     evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides briefing/instruction concerning the
     discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
     proficiency to remedy the discrepancy. The discrepancy area/subarea description is
     annotated with ―Debriefed‖ in paragraph B of the Examiner’s Remarks section of the AF
     Form 8/8a Comments.
     5.2.12.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by a flight examiner to
     remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
        5.2.12.2.1. Additional training may include self-study, ground instruction, use of a
        simulator or flying. To complete additional training, the examinee must demonstrate
        attainment of satisfactory knowledge or proficiency.
54                      AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009


     5.2.12.2.1. (AMC) Initial qualification examinees will not fly as a qualified
     crewmember until additional training is complete.
     5.2.12.2.2. Additional training is documented in paragraph C, Recommended
     Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks in the AF Form 8/8a Comments
     section. Description of assigned additional training will include how satisfactory
     knowledge or proficiency will be demonstrated to a flight examiner or instructor.
     5.2.12.2.2. (934AW) Make additional training recommendations to the 96 AS/CC or
     934 AES/CC as required. After additional training has been assigned by the squadron
     commander, log the additional training requirement under Tab 4 of Operational
     Process Guide C. Follow-up on additional training requirements using the checklist
     on the back of the additional training tracking worksheet.
        5.2.12.2.2.1. (Added-934AW) Using the Notice of Flight Status Action (NFSA)
        worksheet, located in Annex 1 Operational Process Guide A, the OG/OGV will
        notify the 96 AS/DOT or 934 AES/SGNT and their respective flight schedulers of
        required additional training and required dates for completion. 96 AS/DOT or
        934 AES/SGNT will compile the applicable training documents specifying the
        additional training to be accomplished and required completion date.
        5.2.12.2.2.2. (Added-934AW) Upon completion of additional training, 96
        AS/DOT or 934 AES/SGNT will notify 934 OG/OGV by returning the completed
        NFSA worksheet with training completed, instructor’s name and signature, and
        date completed. 934 OG/OGV will confirm accomplishment and record
        completion on the appropriate AF IMT 8. If the required additional training
        necessitated the opening of a training folder, then the completed AF IMT 4025
        will be forwarded to 934 OG/OGV and posted in member’s FEF.
     5.2.12.2.3. Due dates and dates on which additional training is completed will be
     documented in the appropriate areas of the AF Form 8/8a (see paragraphs 7.3.5.5 and
     7.4.5.5).
     5.2.12.2.4. The flight examiner or instructor who completed the additional training
     will sign as the Certifying Official under Additional Training, Section II, verifying
     completion of all assigned training as documented in paragraph C, Recommended
     Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks.
     5.2.12.2.5. Commanders will ensure required additional training is completed.
     Accomplish additional training by the last day of the third month following the date
     of the discrepancy, e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 06, additional training must be
     accomplished by 30 Apr 06. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for
     completion of additional training, the squadron commander will review the situation
     and direct appropriate action. Document the circumstances with an MFR placed in
     Section II of the FEF of the affected individual. Incorporate the information contained
     in the MFR onto the affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D,
     Additional Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFRs from the FEF.
     Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major
     discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
        5.2.12.2.5.1. (Added-AMC) Instructors, flight examiners, or authorized Aircrew
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                                55


            Training System (ATS) contractor instructor personnel administer additional
            training.
            5.2.12.2.5.2. (Added-AMC) If additional training is not completed by due date,
            the aircrew member will fly in supervised status.
            5.2.12.2.5.3. (Added-AMC) An instructor or flight examiner graded Q-2 on any
            evaluation will not perform instructor or examiner duties until the Q-2 is cleared.
            Flight examiners will clear instructor Q-2s. Flight examiner Q-2s should be
            cleared according to the pyramid evaluation system.
  5.2.13. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
     5.2.13.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or
     ground recheck must be completed by the end of the second month after the date of the
     first failure, e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 05, complete the recheck by 31 Aug 05.
     AFRC/ANG accomplishes rechecks by the last day of the third month following the date
     of the first failure (in this example, by 30 Sep 05). A recheck is successfully completed
     when the aircrew member performs to Q criteria (Q or Q-/debriefed) for each area graded
     U. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the time limits in this paragraph on a case-by-case
     basis. Document such action with an MFR placed in Section II of the FEF. Incorporate
     the information contained in the MFR onto the affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner
     Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when action is complete, and remove the
     MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF only when
     the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later
     Form 8/8a. Every reasonable effort must be made to requalify the individual.
     Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed during this period, based
     on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and hours of training required.
     The flight examiner that administered the original check will not normally administer the
     recheck.
     5.2.13.2. Status Downgrade. Downgrade aircrew members receiving a Q-3 INSTM,
     QUAL or MSN evaluation to non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-
     CMR), non-basic mission capable (N-BMC), or non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ)
     status, as applicable. For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC)
     need not be downgraded if the discrepancies were only in instructor areas.
     5.2.13.2. (AMC) Status Downgrade. Mission evaluations graded overall Q-3 will
     result in non-mission ready status in that mission only.
         5.2.13.2.1. (Added-AMC) AFRC only. Downgrade to lower crew duty position. In
         those cases where failure of a flight evaluation results in downgrading to a lower crew
         duty qualification (that is, instructor pilot to aircraft commander, aircraft commander
         to first pilot, etc.), these individuals may perform duty in the lower position without
         supervision provided that this action was recommended by the flight evaluator and
         properly annotated on the AF FORM 8.
     5.2.13.3. (Added-934AW) Notification of grade less than Q-1. Upon notification of an
     evaluation graded less than Q1, OGV will determine the crewmembers status, restrictions
     and necessary training requirements. The senior OGV representative will complete a
     Notice of Flight Status Action (NFSA) and follow the NFSA Checklist found in Annex 1,
56                              AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009


        Operations Process A, NFSA Folder. OGV and squadron training will monitor the
        progress of training and make notes as to the adequacy of training on the NFSA sheet.
        Training will be reviewed to determine adequacy at the one and two month gates during
        the Review and Certification Board if required. When training is complete, DOT will
        forward the completed NFSA original to OGV for AF IMT 8 completion, or for
        scheduling a requalification evaluation, as required. NFSA sheets will be maintained for
        6 months under the respective crew positions label in the NFSA folder.
     5.2.14. Restrictions.       Substandard performance in any area/subarea may require
     restrictions to ensure operational safety or mission accomplishment. When called for by this
     instruction or deemed necessary in the judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will
     be imposed on the examinee until successful completion of assigned additional training
     and/or a recheck.
        5.2.14.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
        requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
        5.2.14.2. Specific restrictions and the criteria for the removal of the restrictions will be
        documented as the first item of the AF Form 8/8a Comments. Restrictions associated
        with failed requisite examinations will not be documented on the AF Form 8/8a.
        5.2.14.3. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q-3 on an evaluation until a successful evaluation
        is completed:
            5.2.14.3.1. For QUAL evaluations, place the examinee on supervised status in the
            aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the
            evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For specialized
            qualified, universally qualified, or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining
            qualification for similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2
            may direct supervised status in all aircraft in which the individual maintains
            qualification.
            5.2.14.3.1. (AMC) Qualification Evaluation. AECMs who Q-3 in one qualification
            aircraft will fly in supervised status in all aircraft until recheck in that aircraft is
            complete.
            5.2.14.3.2. For INSTM evaluations, restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
            examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
            5.2.14.3.3. MSN        Evaluation.    The     examinee       may     perform    basic
            qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
            supervised status for mission tasks.
            5.2.14.3.3. (AMC)      Only applies to the specific Q-3 mission.
            5.2.14.3.4. INSTR Evaluation. Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any
            instructor area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is
            completed.
            5.2.14.3.4. (AMC) Re-evaluation may be administered in the aircraft, verbally, or
            in an Aircrew Training Device (ATD) at the examiner's discretion.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                                57


         5.2.14.3.5. (Added-AMC) AFRC only. Squadron commanders review the records
         of aircrew members who fail a flight evaluation. Document the commander’s review
         in the individual’s FEF. Squadron commander’s signature in Section III of the AF
         FORM 8 satisfies this requirement.
             5.2.14.3.5.1. (Added-AMC) AGR, ART, and Traditional Reservist (TR)
             aircrew members are disqualified or removed from aviation service when they
             indicate a repetitive pattern of failure and/or marginal performance according to
             AFI 11-402, as supplemented, and reassigned to a non-flying position or removed
             under the provisions of AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse Actions.
             5.2.14.3.5.2. (Added-AMC) Civilian aircrew members are notified according to
             AFI 36-1001, Managing the Civilian Performance Program, when they fail to pass
             a qualification examination or flight evaluation. They may be removed from
             aviation service and reassigned to a non-flying position, or removed under the
             provisions of AFI 36-704 when they indicate a repetitive pattern of failure and/or
             marginal performance.
  5.2.15. Supervised Status. If unsatisfactory performance requires the aircrew member be
  placed on supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor)
  will be determined by the squadron commander (or equivalent) and as specified in AFI 11-2
  MDS-Specific Volume 1. Supervision will be accomplished by instructors or designated
  supervisors (as specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1) qualified in the specific
  aircrew position.
     5.2.15.1. (Added-934AW) Unqualified crew member. In the event an aircrew member
     becomes unqualified as a result of an overdue evaluation or commander directed
     downgrade, OGV will forward a Notice of Flight Status Action letter to the Squadron
     Training for processing to ensure the individual does not fly in an unqualified status.
     Follow the checklist guidance in the NFSA folder to process this paperwork.
  5.2.16. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
  member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
  eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in
  paragraph 5.2.7.2 for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, the aircrew member loses
  the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph 5.2.14.3 apply.
  Qualification may be re-established by administering a requalification evaluation (see
  paragraph 5.2.3.2) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation. OG/CCs may approve
  waivers to preclude the re-accomplishment of completed requisites to complete the
  evaluation on a case-by-case basis. Document such action with an MFR placed in Section II
  of the FEF. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected AF Form
  8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when action is complete,
  and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF
  only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a
  later Form 8/8a.
  5.2.17. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew
  members who maintain qualification in two or more mission design series aircraft. When
  differences between series aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead MAJCOM, in
  coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate qualification
58                             AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009


     requirements. When separate qualification is not required, document certification in different
     MDS series using AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training, or AF Form
     4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification
     document signed by an authorized official (such as a Letter of X’s).
     5.2.17. (AMC) Multiple Qualification. Unit certification document is the Letter of X’s.
     This replaces the use of 1381/4348s. The Letter of X’s is populated by signed AF IMT
     4324s. See Attachment 10 (Added) for sample letter of X’s. The unit training officer, in
     coordination with the SARM, will generate a monthly Letter of X’s to be signed by the
     SQ/CC or authorized official. SQ/DOV will maintain monthly letters for 12 Months. Flight
     Evaluators may make pen and ink changes to the latest/master letter to update certifications
     until the next monthly letter is published. Changes must be initialed by the evaluator.
     Evaluators will not annotate own certifications. A copy of the latest Letter of X’s will be
     placed in the member’s FEF prior to PCS for record.
        5.2.17.1. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
        including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained, in an MFR placed in
        Section II of the FEF. (For Air Force Materiel Command [AFMC], MAJCOM authority
        may be delegated, but not lower than wing commander.) See AFI 11-202, Volume 1, for
        additional guidance.
        5.2.17.1. (AMC) For O-6 and below, HQ AMC/A3 is approval authority according to
        AFI 11-202 Volume 1. Forward request through channels (Sq/CC, OG/CC, AMC/A3V,
        etc.). For AFRC, HQ AFRC/DO is approval authority. Refer to AFI 11-202 Vol 1, AFRC
        Sup 1 for procedures to request multiple qualifications. For ANG, approval authority is
        NGB/A3O. Multiple qualifications of General Officers is IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1.
        AMC/A3V AF Flight Nurse (FN) and Aeromedical Evacuation Technician (AET)
        examiners may maintain multiple qualifications in the C-17, C-130, KC-135 and C-21
        when applicable.
            5.2.17.1.1. (Added-AMC) Approved          crewmembers       completing     multiple
            qualifications see the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 1 for training
            requirements. Complete certification or evaluation according to the appropriate AFI
            11-2MDS-Specific Volume 2.
        5.2.17.2. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
        include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified
        by the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are
        directed by the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
        5.2.17.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL
        evaluation, and, if applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each mission
        design series aircraft according to applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2. When
        specified IAW paragraph 5.2.17, QUAL and MSN evaluations are required for different
        series aircraft in the same MDS.
        5.2.17.4. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q-3 on an INSTM evaluation results
        in a downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A
        downgrade resulting from a Q-3 in QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                                  59


     for which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the
     discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft.
  5.2.18. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized
  aircrew who maintain qualification in two or more mission design series aircraft where
  qualification is attained/maintained via a minimum of a ground phase examination.
  MAJCOMs may require a flight phase evaluation. AE crewmembers require a ground and
  flight phase evaluation, IAW AFI 11-2AE, Volume 2. The flight phase evaluation, when
  required, may be accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either
  gaining or maintaining qualification, and will update qualification on all aircraft listed on the
  specialized aircrew member’s Aeronautical Order (AO). MAJCOMs may specify additional
  ground phase requisites.
     5.2.18.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualifications
     IAW Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified
     crewmember eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
     5.2.18.2. Documentation.       Specialized aircrew qualifications maintained under
     Universal Qualification guidance will be documented on an AF Form 8a, IAW paragraph
     7.4 AECM qualification will be documented using AF Form 8, IAW paragraph 7.3
     5.2.18.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations.            All aircrew qualifications
     maintained under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A
     MSN evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2
     and/or MAJCOM supplement to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will
     include a flight phase evaluation in one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member
     maintains qualification.
     5.2.18.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally
     qualified aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in
     loss of applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI 11-2 MDS-
     Specific Volumes 2.
  5.2.19. Aircrews Flying in Non-US Air Force Aircraft and with Non-US Air Force
  Units. Aircrew members authorized to perform duties in non-US Air Force aircraft IAW
  AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached to non-US Air Force units for flying, abide by host
  service or host country guidance, except for the requirement to maintain a current physical
  and review their flight records according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1. They do not necessarily
  abide by USAF guidance, including AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
  Volume 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF units, they must complete applicable
  requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF evaluations that expired during their tour.
  The restrictions in paragraph 5.2.14 of this instruction apply to such individuals until
  successful evaluations are completed.
     1. MAJCOMs may approve exceptions to requirements for returning aircrew members to
        complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if, after case-by-case
        review, they determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2
        MDS-Specific Volume 2 evaluations. Document such action with an MFR placed in
        Section II of the FEF on top of the non-USAF AF Form 8 equivalent.
60                               AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009


          2. Air Force units that use non-US Air Force aircraft to execute an Air Force flying
             program will comply with current Air Force guidance, unless excepted by proper
             authority. See AFI 11-401 for definitions of Air Force and US Government aircraft.
5.3.     Emergency Procedures Evaluations.
     5.3.1. Scope. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs and systems
     knowledge for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate MSN specific emergency procedures and
     systems knowledge during MSN evaluations. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for
     each combined evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN
     evaluation). A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
     INSTM/QUAL eval). The combined EPE must be of a scope and duration to cover required
     areas and must be within the requisite zone for each evaluation.
     5.3.2. Satisfactory Performance. Satisfactory performance for EPEs requires taking the
     proper action in the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is
     responsible for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
     5.3.3. Content and Administration. AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 will specify
     contents of EPEs, grading areas to be evaluated, grading criteria and whether EPEs may be
     done inflight, in an ATD, or verbally.
     5.3.4. Grading. The flight examiner will assign an EPE grade 1, 2, or 3 (Qualification
     Level 1, 2, or 3) in the Qualification Ground Phase block of the AF Form 8/8a, regardless of
     whether all or a portion of the EPE was performed inflight.
     5.3.5. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight examiner
     will indicate if the additional training will be accomplished before next flight under
     restrictions in the Comments block of the AF Form 8/8a.
     5.3.6. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP situation during
     an EPE requires an unqualified (3) EPE grade. An aircrew member who receives a 3 grade as
     a result of Boldface/CAPs error will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
     accomplished.
     5.3.7. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an unqualified EPE grade (3) will be
     placed on supervised status until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.
5.4. Supplementary Evaluations. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by
a commander to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to operational problems. These
evaluations are most often administered as inspections (using specifically prepared checklists)
where results are reported to the commander. The form and content of supplementary evaluations
is at the discretion of the commander.
5.4. (934AW) Supplementary Evaluation Program. The 934 OG Supplementary Evaluation
Program is an administrative tool used to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to
operation problems. This program seeks to provide ―   improvement comments‖ rather than
―critique comments‖. Supplementary Evaluations will be conducted at the direction/request of
the 934 OG/CC.
       5.4.1. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                           61


  5.4.2. Commanders will determine evaluated areas. The stan/eval function will determine
  the method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative management of data collection,
  and will report results as directed by the commander.
  5.4.3. Individuals other than flight examiners, as determined by the OG/CC, may conduct
  supplementary evaluations.
  5.4.4. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight
  evaluation. If conducted in-flight, supplementary evaluations should not be all-
  encompassing, nor result in the assignment of an overall rating for any specific aircrew
  member, nor be documented on an AF Form 8/8a.
  5.4.5. Supplementary evaluation results will be documented in SEB minutes.
  5.4.6. (Added-934AW) Accomplishment. When a supplementary evaluation is directed,
  934 OG/OGV will determine the scope of the evaluation and who will accomplish the
  evaluation. Use the 934 OG/OGV Supplementary Evaluation Worksheet located under Tab
  2 of Operational Process Guide A to record supplementary evaluation results. After
  completion of the Supplementary Evaluation, return the form to the 934 OG/OGV POC.
  5.4.7. (Added-934AW) Reporting Data. The 934 OG/OGV will analyze all information
  gathered and formalize all information on the Supplementary Evaluation Worksheet. If
  action is required, fill out a Supplementary Evaluation Action Tracker worksheet located
  under Tab 2 of Operational Process Guide A. The formalized report will be forwarded to all
  applicable personnel. The results of the evaluations will be kept in the 934 OG/OGV files
  for a minimum of one year. All Supplementary Evaluations will be discussed and
  documented as a part of the SEB program at a minimum.

                           AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written, computer-based
or electronic examinations. Poor testing performance on examinations indicates areas requiring
increased training emphasis.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, navigators, and air battle managers), career
enlisted aviator (CEA), and non-rated X-prefix AE aircrew. For Flight Surgeons (rated) and non-
rated aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code), see Chapter 8. The
examination program in this chapter includes requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and
unit periodic examinations. Requisite examinations include qualification open book and closed
book examinations, instrument examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in
paragraph 5.2.4 The ability to focus on specific knowledge areas is enhanced by the
management of examination content and use of appropriate master question files.
     6.2.1. (Added-934AW) Assign an Exam. In the event an exam must has to be assigned to
     an individual, log in to WinPEX using an individual log-in and password to assign the test.
     Refer to the PEX User Guide for PEX related questions.
     6.2.2. (Added-934AW) Administering a Test. The Test Monitor Checklist, located under
     (Tab 1) of Operational Process Guide J, will be used for all tests administered. Follow the
     checklist accordingly.
     6.2.3. (Added-934AW) The 934 OG/OGV uses Patriot Excalibur for all aircrew testing
     except the Tactics open book exam.
6.3.     Administrative Procedures.
       6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will describe the unit aircrew examination
       program in the unit supplement to this instruction.
       6.3.2. Computer Based or Electronic Examinations. Computer based or electronic
       information management tools may fulfill the requirement for examinations as outlined in
       this instruction.
       6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. The stan/eval function will retain graded exam
       answer sheets/computer records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
     6.3.4. Examination Question Review. The stan/eval function will review all MQFs,
     secure question banks, and prepared exams for accuracy annually and after any changes in
     source documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a source document change
     it may be annotated as the annual review. Units will document their procedures for reviewing
     and updating MQFs and prepared exams in their unit supplement to this instruction.
       6.3.5. End-of-Course Examinations. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses
       listed in the Air Force Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) database
       (https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) examinations to fulfill the
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                                63


   requirements of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite
   examinations.
       6.3.5.1. The stan/eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate
       with the MDS lead command to ensure the EOC examination meets the requirements of
       this instruction and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 before awarding credit for
       requisite completion.
       6.3.5.2. EOC examination test questions do not need to incorporate MAJCOM MQFs.
       All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures
       and not conflict with any MQFs.
       6.3.5.3. All EOC examinations that fulfill the requirements of requisite examinations
       will be graded according to paragraph 6.4.4.1 and entered on the AF Form 8 according to
       paragraph 7.3.5.1
6.4. Requisite Examinations. Aircrew members will complete open book, closed book and
Boldface/CAPs examinations (if applicable) as requisites for periodic QUAL evaluations (see
paragraph 5.2.4.1), instrument examination as requisite for periodic INSTM evaluations (see
paragraph 5.2.4.2), and any other examinations required by the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-
Specific Volume 2 (see paragraph 5.2.4.3).
6.4. (934AW) Unit Testing Program. The 934 OG requisite testing program consists of an
open-book, closed-book and boldface examination during the qualification eligibility periods for
all crew positions All tests are administered using the Patriot Excalibur (PEX) Testing Module.
Tests will be graded using the PEX program and results are automatically logged on the IMT
Form 8.
6.4. (AMC) Requisite Examinations. Unless otherwise specified in the appropriate AFI 11-
2MDS-Specific Volume 2, individuals qualified as crewmembers in more than one MDS aircraft
must complete open and closed book exam for each aircraft.
   6.4.1. Requisite Examination Management.                With the exception of written
   Boldface/CAPs examinations, maintain either requisite examinations for each crew position
   or generate a unique test for each aircrew member requiring an exam.
       6.4.1.1.   If requisite examinations are maintained for each crew position:
           6.4.1.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two requisite
           examinations for each crew position.
           6.4.1.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one
           examination.
           6.4.1.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information,
           units are not required to maintain separate examinations for each crew position.
           6.4.1.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on requisite
           examinations each calendar year.
           6.4.1.1.4. (934AW) Aircrew Examinations. Since tests are randomly generated
           using PEX, the requirement to change fifty percent (50%) of the test questions semi-
           annually is not applicable.
64                             AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009


        6.4.1.2.   If a unique test is generated for each aircrew member requiring an exam:
            6.4.1.2.1.   Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for test creation.
            6.4.1.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain a sufficient number of questions to
            ensure a probability of no more than 50 percent duplication of questions for each test
            generated.
     6.4.2. Examination Security. Stan/eval personnel will maintain positive control of all
     requisite exams, applicable answer sheets and associated computer based/electronic media.
     EXCEPTION: Requisite Open-book Flight Surgeon examination will be maintained by
     AFMOA/SGPA.
     6.4.2. (934AW) Test Bank Security. Open Book and IRC test banks are stored on the
     Master CD in the locked drawer of the rotating cabinet in Room 111. QDBs in PEX are
     password protected via evaluator log-ins and permissions.
     6.4.3. Grading Policy For Examinations.
        6.4.3.1. Minimum Passing Grade. The minimum passing grade for Boldface/CAPs
        exams is 100 percent. The minimum passing grade for all other stan/eval requisite
        examinations is 85 percent - corrected to 100 percent.
        6.4.3.2. Requisite and Boldface/CAPs Examination Grading Restriction. Units will
        grade all completed requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew member’s
        next flight. In the unit supplement to this instruction describe how this restriction is
        enforced.
        6.4.3.3. (Added-934AW) The PEX Program will score all tests and store the results as
        you finish the exam. All requisite examinations must be corrected to 100%. If there are
        any discrepancies on the test or questions that are challenged, a Bad Test Question Report
        Form under (Tab 2) of Operational Process Guide J, will be filled out and returned to
        respective OG/OGV crew positions in-box for review.
     6.4.4. Examination Question Sources.
        6.4.4.1. Open Book Requisite Exam. Open book questions will come from
        publications containing information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and
        performance of the assigned mission. The open book subject areas and the publications
        used to generate the exam will be made available to aircrew. Each unit may develop an
        open book secure question bank (SQB) that serves as the source for some or all of the
        open book examination questions. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
        safeguard it in the same manner as any other required stan/eval examination. Electronic
        publications may be used for open book examinations.
        6.4.4.1. (934AW) Open Book Exam Sources. Open book qualification and mission
        exam sources are listed in Attachment 11 to this supplement. Use Attachment 11 to
        determine which sources need to be used for development of the open book QDB.
        Ensure frequent updates (quarterly at a minimum) are made to the QDB to ensure FCIF
        volumes I, II, III, and IV are being incorporated and updated on a regular basis. A
        portion of the qualification open book exam will be derived from the marshaling QDB to
        satisfy the marshaling test requirements.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                              65


        6.4.4.1.1. (Added-AMC) If not specified in the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-
        Specific Volume 2, Open book exam will be derived from the Secure Question Bank
        (SQB) for each crew position of each MDS. The OG/OGV will create and manage
        the Open book examination process. Open book questions will be drawn from
        appropriate information contained in FCIF Volumes I, II, III, and IV.
        6.4.4.1.1. (934AW) Updating Secure Question Banks. QDBs must be updated any
        time a publication change affects questions in the respective bank. Questions will
        also be reviewed annually in January. To update a question bank, refer to the PEX
        User’s Guide. Upon completion of changes save QDB information on the following
        drive: MSPNT05/OG/OGV/TESTING/PEX/ [Individual crew position]. PEX QDB
        information will then be saved to a Re-writable CD and placed in the 934 OG/OGV
        Test Locker.
            6.4.4.1.1.1. (Added-AMC) Crewmembers qualified to conduct ground taxi
            operations will be tested on their knowledge of marshaling signals IAW AFI 11-
            218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground. Units may administer a
            ground marshaling examination as part of the open book examination.
            6.4.4.1.1.1. (934AW) Bad Question Report. If a question is found to be
            incorrect, inaccurate, or non-applicable it should be marked as ―Bad Question‖ on
            the ― edit question‖ tab of the PEX testing module. Record all actions taken in the
            bad question report located under Tab 2 of Operational Process Guide J. Any
            questions in the Open Book, IRC, or Instructor banks may be changed without
            coordination with NAF. However, any changes made to the Closed Book banks
            must have prior NAF approval. The ―     Bad Question‖ tab in the PEX system is for
            OGV reference to questions needing to be changed. It does not preclude that
            question being assigned on subsequent tests. If you want to throw a question out
            so it cannot be assigned again, you need to select the ―
                                                                   Question N/A‖ tab. After a
            bad question has been corrected, place a copy of the bad test question form under
            Tab 4 of Operational Process Guide J and maintain for 6 months.
        6.4.4.1.2. (Added-AMC) A portion of each open book exam will include questions
        pertaining to each mission qualification of the individual being tested. Include
        airdrop, AR, SOLL II, PNAF, cargo, instructor (scenario type), etc., as required.
     6.4.4.2. Closed Book Requisite Exams. Closed book questions will come from
     MQFs. These questions will emphasize system knowledge and information necessary for
     safe flight and mission accomplishment.
     6.4.4.2. (934AW) A closed-book exam for all qualification evaluations will be
     generated through the PEX Program; PEX will randomly select a minimum of 20
     questions from the Master Question File (MQF). The Boldface examination will be
     completed in conjunction with closed-book exam. Boldface examinations are required to
     be written as they are depicted in the dash - 1, to include the correct crew position. If
     necessary, OGV will develop an individual crew position QDB that incorporates local
     procedures to augment the QDB sent by headquarters

        6.4.4.2.1. MDS-Specific MQFs. Lead command MAJCOMs will ensure MDS-
        Specific MQFs containing approved questions for closed book testing are available
        for MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable aircrew.
        6.4.4.2.1. (AMC) If not specified in the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific
        Volume 2, mobility forces complete their closed book examination using a minimum
        of 20 questions from the MQF. When developing a closed book examination from the
        MQF, the unit should select questions to sample aircrew knowledge areas or correct
        potential trends.
            6.4.4.2.1.1. The highest organization with a stan/eval function (NAF or unit)
            may develop, maintain and publish MQFs for weapons systems without
            MAJCOM expertise. That organization will submit these MQFs to the MAJCOM
            for approval prior to their publication.
            6.4.4.2.1.1. (AMC) HQ AMC/A3V will coordinate, build, maintain and
            distribute one common MQF for each crew position of each MDS. The MQF will
            contain at least 100 questions with periodic updates, as necessary. A
            comprehensive MQF is encouraged. MQF questions will be derived from the
            basic aircraft flight manual, performance manual, other applicable technical
            orders, AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 3, AFTTP 3-1.1, AFTTP 3-1.2 and
            AFTTP 3-1/3 MDS Specific. AMC/A3V may delegate a portion or all of MQF
            development and maintenance requirements to specific active duty, ANG, or
            AFRC units; or a designated civilian contractor providing this service, but will
            maintain active supervision of MQF contents.
            6.4.4.2.1.2. MAJCOM OPRs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes
            to MQFs as necessary.
            6.4.4.2.1.2. (AMC) MQFs are available for download on the AMC/A3V
            website. The OG will distribute the MQF to all unit aircrew members.
               6.4.4.2.1.2.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing
               procedures, administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or
               operational procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
               6.4.4.2.1.2.1. (AMC)     OGV will forward corrections to AMC/A3V.
               6.4.4.2.1.2.2.   Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate
               MAJCOM.
        6.4.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local
        procedures MQF databank to augment HHQ MQFs.
        6.4.4.2.2. (AMC) May be included in the SQB.
     6.4.4.3. Instrument Requisite Exams. Instrument test questions come from the
     Instrument MQF maintained by the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA). The
     selection and content of the questions is dictated by the provisions of AFMAN 11-210.
     6.4.4.3. (AMC) Instrument Requisite Exams. Exam requirements follow open book
     format and the exam is normally generated at the unit level. IRC program and Instrument
     Examination questions are available on Air Force Flight Standardization Agency
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                               67


     (AFFSA)                   website,                  IRC                              Page:

        6.4.4.3.1. (Added-AMC) Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) instrument
        examinations remain valid concurrent with the individual's initial qualification
        instrument evaluation. IRC or equivalent courseware may satisfy this requirement.
        Units will determine an internal process for managing ENJJPT instrument
        examination dates and scores. Incorporate the scores on the individual’s first initial
        qualification AF Form 8.
     6.4.4.4. (Added-AMC) Tactics Requisite Exams. All pilots, navigators, flight engineers
     and loadmasters will accomplish a Tactics Examination as a requisite to their recurring
     mission evaluation. Boom operators will accomplish the tactics exam as a requisite to
     their air refueling qual (KC-10) and qual/msn (KC-135) flight evaluation, and not in
     association with their qual/msn (KC-10) and msn (KC-135) cargo evaluation.
     Communications System Operators (CSO) Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members
     (AECM) and Flight Attendants (FA) are not required to take the Tactics exam. The
     tactics exam will consist of a minimum of 25 questions from the Secure Question Bank
     (SQB). Tactics exams are not crewmember specific. Only two test versions are required
     IAW para 6.4.1.1.1. Include tactics exam scores on the AF FORM 8 .
        6.4.4.4.1. (Added-AMC) AMC Tactics has created a classified secure question bank
        (SQB) for each MDS which may be obtained by contacting AMC/A3D at DSN: 779-
        1765. AMC/A3D will continue to maintain the AMC tactics SQB. Instructions for
        obtaining         the           SQB           are         on          SIPRNET
        at:http://www.amc.scott.af.smil.mil/hosted_orgs/dok/A39T/G060/G060.htm.
        6.4.4.4.2. (Added-AMC) OG/CCs will determine the best way to facilitate the
        Tactics exam based on group manning and logistics/secure areas. OG/CCs are
        encouraged to use the resources at their disposal to provide suitable classified testing
        and study areas. The long term goal is for units to acquire appropriate AMCI11-207
        compliant facilities and for Stan/Eval to begin producing and administering the tactics
        exam. Access to electronic publications is preferred where practical.
  6.4.5. Boldface/CAPs Requisite Examinations.
     6.4.5.1. Aircrew member knowledge of applicable Boldface/CAPs will be evaluated
     through a written examination as a requisite to all periodic QUAL evaluations.
     6.4.5.1. (AMC) Examinations will consist of one question concerning each Bold
     Face/Critical Action Emergency Procedure applicable to an individual's specialty.
     Individuals qualified as crew members in more than one MDS aircraft must complete a
     Bold Face exam for each aircraft.
     6.4.5.2. Satisfactory performance for the Boldface/CAPs examination requires writing
     the proper actions in the correct sequence, not necessarily a verbatim response. The flight
     examiner will assign a Boldface/CAPs grade (Q or U) in the Qualification Ground Phase
     block of the AF Form 8/8a.
     6.4.5.2. (AMC) AMC policy is that Bold Face will be written as depicted in the flight
     manual (dash 1 or Vol 3 for AECM) aircrew checklists, to include the correct crew
68                             AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009


        positions for the prescribed action. Unit commanders will ensure that crews are trained to
        this standard; however, HQ AMC does not intend for examiners to quibble over
        punctuation or minor misspellings. AFRC units will accomplish a Boldface Exam prior to
        the first flight of each month.
     6.4.6. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam. An evaluation will not be complete until all
     failed items have been successfully re-accomplished.
     6.4.6. (934AW) Failure to Pass a Written Examination. If an examinee fails to pass an
     Open Book, Closed Book, or IRC exam, the 934 OG/OGV will notify the 96 AS/DOT, 934
     AES/DOT, and Crew Scheduling using the Notice of Flight Status Action form. The
     96AS/CC/DO will be informed via Review and Certification Board. Examinee must be
     placed in Supervised Status. The individual will perform in-flight duties only under the
     direct supervision of an instructor until a successful retest is accomplished. A successful
     retest must be accomplished by the end of the third month following the date of the failed
     exam.
        6.4.6.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination at
        any time must be afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other
        than Boldface/CAPs, the aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
        6.4.6.1. (AMC) Reexamination Policy. An initial qualification or requalification
        student who fails an Aircrew Training System (ATS) examination while attending
        FTU/CCTS training will retake the ATS exam and complete the appropriate open and
        closed book examinations before flight evaluations.
        6.4.6.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite examination
        must complete a successful reexamination by the end of the second month (AFRC/ANG:
        third month) following the date of the first failure, or the end of their eligibility period,
        whichever occurs first. Waiver authority to extend the time allowed to successfully
        complete the examination is the OG/CC. Document such waivers with an MFR placed in
        Section II of the FEF of the affected individual. Incorporate the information contained in
        the MFR onto the affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D,
        Additional Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF.
        Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy
        addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
        6.4.6.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
        Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful reexamination is
        accomplished.
        6.4.6.3. (934AW) Failure to Pass a Boldface Examination. Aircrew members failing a
        boldface exam will not fly as an aircrew member until a successful retest has been
        accomplished. If an examinee fails a boldface exam, the 934 OG/OGV will notify the 96
        AS/DOT, 934 AES/DOT, and Crew Scheduling using the Notice of Flight Status Action
        form. The 96AS/CC/DO will be informed via Review and Certification Board.
        Examinee must be placed in Supervised Status. The individual will not fly until a
        successful retest is accomplished. Ensure boldface failures are updated on the aircrew
        status board as part of the go no-go program on the STAN/EVAL flight evaluation sheet.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                                 69


       6.4.6.4. Supervised Status Requirement. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite
       open book, closed book, or instrument examination in supervised status until successful
       retesting is completed. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications,
       supervised status resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination
       applies only to the aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of a
       requisite instrument exam results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all
       aircraft in which instrument qualification is required.
       6.4.6.5. (Added-AMC) AFRC only. Squadron commanders review flying records of
       aircrew members who fail to take or pass a written standardization examination.
       Document this review describing the circumstances/ actions to be taken and keep on file
       in the unit standardization/training section until corrective action is completed. R&C
       Board action will fulfill this requirement.
           6.4.6.5.1. (Added-AMC) AGR, ART, and Traditional Reservist aircrew members
           are:
               6.4.6.5.1.1. (Added-AMC) Notified in writing of unsatisfactory performance
               when they fail to pass a written examination. Notification includes the training
               program to be pursued to restore the individual’s qualification.
               6.4.6.5.1.2. (Added-AMC) Disqualified or removed from aviation service when
               they indicate a repetitive pattern of failure and/or marginal performance according
               to AFI 11-402, as supplemented, and reassigned to a non-flying position or
               removed under the provisions of AFI 36-704.
           6.4.6.5.2. (Added-AMC) Civilian aircrew members are:
               6.4.6.5.2.1. (Added-AMC) Notified according to AFI 36-1001 when they fail to
               pass a qualification examination or flight evaluation.
               6.4.6.5.2.2. (Added-AMC) Removed from aviation service and reassigned to a
               non-flying position, or removed under the provisions of AFI 36-704 when they
               indicate a repetitive pattern of failure and/or marginal performance.
6.5. Unit Periodic Examinations (optional). Each group/squadron stan/eval function may
conduct periodic testing for all aircrew. The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional
knowledge beyond the scope of requisite exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge,
tactical/threat knowledge, and/or operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge
deficiencies exist within the unit. This exam may be open or closed book, but will not count as a
requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy the requirement for a periodic exam. Units will
describe this program in the unit supplement to this instruction, to include procedures for failed
exams.
6.5. (934AW) Periodic Examinations. A periodic examination can be used to evaluate
additional knowledge beyond the scope of requisite exams, help identify trends, or to determine
knowledge deficiencies within the unit. Periodic examination QDBs will be created separately
and tailored to cover the topic desired to be evaluated. Refer to the PEX user guide for
information on how to create, assign, administer and grade examinations. Test may also be
printed out and administered in mass via a paper copy. Correct all examinations administered to
100% with the individual. Individuals scoring below 85% will not be put on supervised status
70                           AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009


based solely on their test score. AF IMT 8’s will not be generated to record the results of
periodic examinations. Results of periodic examinations can be used to help establish possible
trends or to determine if trends have been corrected. Test results will be maintained in the PEX
data base if the test was administered using the PEX testing module. If a paper version of the
examination was administered, destroy the examination when the desired information has been
extracted.
6.5. (AMC) Unit Periodic Examinations (optional). Ground N/N Exam. Unit's Periodic
Examination program may be combined with unit N/N program. Include program details in unit
supplement.
     6.5.1. (Added-AMC)     An AF Form 8 will not be generated simply for a failed periodic
     examination.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                                71

                                     DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications and authorizations for which an aircrew member is to be
evaluated are determined from the unit certification document. The results of aircrew evaluations
are recorded on the AF Form 8 or AF Form 8a, which certifies the qualification of the aircrew
member. The chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF
Form 942, Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF for the aircrew
member. EXCEPTION: Not required for cadets participating in USAFA airmanship programs.
7.2. Qualifications and Certifications. Aircrew qualifications are attained through
evaluations and documented on the AF Form 8 or the AF Form 8a, as applicable. Aircrew
certifications attained through methods other than evaluation (instructor-certified events and
commander certifications for example) may be documented on an AF Form 1381, USAF
Certification of Air Crew Training, or AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. As an
alternative to use of AF Form 1381 or AF Form 4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit
certification document signed by an authorized official.
7.3. AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification. Certification of an AF
   Form 8 is accomplished by four individuals, beginning with the Flight Examiner, who
   completes the evaluation by signing the AF Form 8. Next, the Reviewing Officer and Final
   Approving Officer review the contents, the flight examiner’s overall assessment, ensure all
   required additional training was adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete,
   and sign the AF Form 8. The final signature is provided by the examinee, who will sign the
   completed AF Form 8. EXCEPTION: For a Commander-Directed Downgrade AF Form 8,
   only the commander signs as the Final Approving Officer. See paragraph 7.4.8
       7.3.1.1.   Use a separate AF Form 8 for all flight phase rechecks.
       7.3.1.2. Ground rechecks will be completed on the original Q-3 AF Form 8 (see
       paragraph 7.3.9).
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. Use the following guidance when completing an AF Form 8.
   See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8.
       7.3.2.1. For date fields in the AF Form 8 use a two-digit day, three-letter month and
       two-digit year format. For electronic forms, use the date format required by the form.
       7.3.2.2. The Eligibility Period and Expiration Date of Qualification will use a three-
       letter month and two-digit year format. For electronic forms, use the date format required
       by the form.
       7.3.2.3. Except for the organization of the Comments block described in paragraph
       7.3.7, sample AF Forms 8 are provided to demonstrate the content, not the format, of the
       data presented (see Attachment 3).
       7.3.2.4. To facilitate the entry of data on the form, except where specifically noted
       otherwise, use upper and lower case letters.

        7.3.2.5. Requirements for letter font, numbers of spaces for indentation and justification
        (right, left or centered) of data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct
        specific format standards for such data entry.
     7.3.3. Date Completed.
        7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date (ground or flight phase) of the evaluation
        requisites or the additional training.
        7.3.3.2.    Use this date on the AF Form 942.
     7.3.4.    Section I - Examinee Identification.

              7.3.4.3.2. Enter the examinee’s highest qualification reflecting the intention of the
              evaluation (e.g., IP, MP, MN, MF, MAWO, ISD, IAM, etc.) in that particular aircraft
              MDS. Note: Examiner is not a qualification, it is a certification, and should only be
              entered when demonstrated during the evaluation, i.e., a SPOT evaluation in which
              the examinee receives an evaluation while administering an evaluation.
        7.3.4.4.    Eligibility Period.
              7.3.4.4.1. Enter the 6-month period preceding the expiration date from the last
              similar periodic aircrew qualification evaluation (e.g., if the last MSN evaluation

              7.3.4.4.2. Enter N/A (not applicable) for initial periodic aircrew qualification
              evaluations, SPOT evaluations, and requalification (RQ) evaluations.
              7.3.4.4.2. (AMC) Enter N/A for all evaluations given within an eligibility period,
              but not intended to satisfy a recurring requirement (e.g. SPOT, N/N SPOT, etc.)
              7.3.4.4.3. Dual entries are authorized for misaligned combined evaluations (e.g., if
              last INSTM evaluation expires Nov 06 and QUAL evaluation expires Jan 07, enter
              ―INSTM: Jun-Nov 06/QUAL: Aug 06-Jan 07‖ for an INSTM/QUAL evaluation).
              7.3.4.4.4. For periodic evaluations where the evaluation expiration date of the
              previous evaluation is extended under the provisions of paragraph 5.2.6.3.1, enter the
              6-month period preceding the original expiration date. Note: Squadron commanders
              extend only the expiration date, not the eligibility period.

7.6. AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training. Optional. If used, comply
with the following guidance when completing an AF Form 1381. MAJCOMs may prescribe use
of AF Form 1381 or AF Form 4348 (see paragraph 7.7). If prescribed, use either form. See
Attachment 6 for sample AF Form 1381.
     7.6.1. Purpose. The AF Form 1381 provides a permanent record/certification source for
     aircrew certifications not attained through an AF Form 8/8a qualification. (MAJCOMs may
     approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized official. An authorized
     official for a unit certification document will be an official authorized to approve an AF
     Form 8 or 8a, or another appropriate authority designated in writing by this official.)
        7.6.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 1381 in the FEF, Section I, documenting
        certifications by individual assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew members
        with multiple aircraft certifications attained through difference training, only one AF
        Form 1381 is required; specify the primary mission MDS designation. File AF Forms
        1381 in chronological order with the most recent on top. Note: May also be filed in an
        aircrew member’s permanent training folder, as a training completion document. When
        AF Form 1381 is used as a training completion document, refer to AFI 11-202, Volume
        1, for guidance.
        7.6.1.2. Unit stan/eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
        aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
        certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
            7.6.1.2.1. The AF Form 1381 will document all certifications attained in previous
            and current MDS(s). Retain as a historical source document. File AF Forms 1381 in
            chronological order with the most recent on top.
            7.6.1.2.2. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review AF Form 1381
            entries in the aircrew member’s training folder to determine applicable certifications
            of new assigned/attached aircrew members. Document aircrew certifications as
            specified by the assigned/attached flying unit commander on a new AF Form 1381.
                7.6.1.2.2.1. The OGV/DOV Chief or other individual designated by the
                squadron commander will sign a one line entry below all other entries signifying
                acceptance of those events listed above (see paragraph 7.6.7 for documentation
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                                 95


                requirements).
         7.6.1.2.3. AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF Form
         1381 certifying officials, IAW paragraph 7.6.3.4
     7.6.1.3. Do not use AF Form 1381 to document one-time training/new equipment
     unless directed by HHQ.
     7.6.1.4. Appropriate guidance that may require aircrew certification using AF Form
     1381 entry include AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement; AFI 11-2 MDS-

   7.7.1. Purpose. The AF Form 4348 provides a permanent record and certification source
   for aircrew certifications not attained through an AF Form 8/8a qualification.
       7.7.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 4348 in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1
       documenting certifications by assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew
       members with aircraft certifications in multiple MDS aircraft which do not require
       qualification in each aircraft (i.e. F-16C and F-16CG), only one AF Form 4348 is
       required; specify the primary mission MDS designation. File AF Forms 4348 in
       chronological order with the most recent on top.
       7.7.1.2. Unit stan/eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
       aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
       certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
          7.7.1.2.1. The AF Form 4348 will document all certifications attained in previous
          and current MDS(s). Retain in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1, as a historical source
          document. File AF Forms 4348 in chronological order with the most recent on top.
          7.7.1.2.2. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review previous AF
          Form 4348 entries to determine all applicable certifications of new assigned/attached
          aircrew member. Then, document applicable aircrew certifications accepted by the
          gaining flying unit commander on a new AF Form 4348.
              7.7.1.2.2.1. The OGV/DOV Chief or other individual designated by the
              squadron commander will sign a one line entry below all other entries verifying
              that above certification transcriptions are accurate (see paragraph 7.7.7 for
              documentation requirements).
          7.7.1.2.3. AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF Form
          4348 certifying officials, IAW paragraph 7.7.3.4
       7.7.1.3. Do not use AF Form 4348 to document one-time training/new equipment
       unless directed by HHQ.

          7.9.2.2.2. Memos for record documenting waivers and extensions are filed on top of
          the affected AF Form 8/8a. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto
          the affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional
          Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Permanent
          MFRs documenting major discrepancies relating to qualification (see paragraph
          7.8.5.1.1) are filed immediately above the latest affected AF Form 8/8a or, in cases
          where the memo is for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a, in
          chronological order with AF Forms 8/8a. Memos for record become a permanent part
          of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed
          or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
         7.9.2.2.2. (AMC) Units may insert an appropriate cover sheet to identify AF Form
         8 previously reviewed by an ASEV team.
         7.9.2.2.3. Memos for record documenting major discrepancies of a particular AF
         Form 8/8a will be filed on top of that AF Form 8/8a regardless of date the
         discrepancy is discovered.
          7.9.2.2.4. Memos for record documenting similar discrepancies found on multiple
          AF Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.

   7.9.4. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
   and how to implement the annual review of FEFs in the unit supplement to this instruction.
   7.9.4. (934AW) FEF reviews. FEF reviews are accomplished IAW 11-202V2/AMCSUP1.
   Ask Training provides for a monthly ARMS products to help monitor annual review
   requirements. PEX also provides an ARMS report, if desired. Use the FEF Review
   Worksheet located under Tab 7 of Operational Process Guide D, to conduct annual reviews
   and document review on the AF IMT 942, Record of Evaluation. Review FEF for currency
   whenever an AF IMT 8 is filed.
      7.9.4.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
      aircrew members to establish their currency and qualification prior to their first flight.
      7.9.4.1. (AMC) Initial Review. Document accomplishment with an ―     Initial Review‖
      and date entry on the AF IMT 942. For Aeromedical Evacuation, an Initial Review will
      be documented following unit of assignment and INIT QUAL/MSN entries.
      7.9.4.1. (934AW) Initial Reviews. Review FEF and annotate AF IMT 942 for any
      newly assigned crewmember. (Initial Review) Document major discrepancies found
      during the review with a MFR.
          7.9.4.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the currency
          and qualification of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable
          documentation in Sections I and II of the FEF. Following determination of the
          currency and qualification of the aircrew member, the unit maintaining the FEF is
          responsible only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
          7.9.4.1.2. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
          stan/eval function at their assigned stations, that stan/eval function will also review
          the FEF prior to their first flight.
      7.9.4.2. Posting Review. The stan/eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a, AF
      Form 1381, or AF Form 4348 when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and
      completeness. This review will confirm that the eligibility period and qualification as
      documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events were accomplished and
      requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that the AF Form 8/8a
      contains all signatures and initials within allotted time. AF Forms 1381/4348 will be
      reviewed for correct certification signature and to ensure all previous entries are
      accounted for and are accurate. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM
      supplement.
      7.9.4.3. Annual Review. The stan/eval function will review all unit FEFs annually to
      confirm expiration dates used to track required periodic aircrew qualification evaluations
      are the same as those listed in the FEFs. Document the annual review IAW unit or
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                             105


     MAJCOM supplement. An annual review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is not
     required.
     7.9.4.3. (AMC) Annual Review. Accomplish within 12 months of the initial or
     previous annual review. Document accomplishment with an ―
                                                             Annual Review‖ and date
     entry on the AF IMT 942. The initial review entry suffices for the annual review
     requirement.
     7.9.4.4. (Added-AMC) While all AF Form 8 and AF IMTs 942 shall be retained in the
     members FEF, additional information contained in the FEF which is not related to the
     member’s current MDS(s) is considered obsolete. Obsolete documents will be returned to
     the member for their records.
  7.9.5. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8/8a, AF
  Form 1381, AF Form 4348, and AF Form 942.
     7.9.5.1. Categories of Discrepancies. Discrepancies are categorized by their impact
     on qualification/certification.
        7.9.5.1.1. Discrepancies that alter the qualification/certification of the affected
        aircrew member are considered major.
        7.9.5.1.2. Those discrepancies that do not alter the qualification/certification of the
        affected aircrew member are considered minor and include typos, formatting and
        misspellings.
     7.9.5.2. Major Discrepancies Disposition.         Identified major discrepancies are
     documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section I or II immediately above the affected
     AF Form 8/8a/1381/4348, or in chronological order with the AF Forms 8/8a/1381/4348
     for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a/1381/4348. An MFR created to
     document late evaluations, OG/CC waivers, etc. is removed from the FEF once the
     information is incorporated onto the completed affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner
     Remarks paragraph D, Additional Comments. Memos for record become a permanent
     part of the FEF only when the major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed
     or corrected by a later AF Form 8/8a.
     7.9.5.3. Minor Discrepancies Disposition. Minor discrepancies are documented on a
     non-permanent record as defined by the unit supplement to this instruction.
     7.9.5.3. (934AW) Minor Discrepancies. Minor discrepancies that do not alter the
     qualification of the affected aircrew member, can be changed on the original document
     using pen and ink or white-out and over-print, and provided the examiner that signed the
     AF IMT 8 initials next to the change. All minor discrepancies will be annotated in the
     FEF discrepancy folder and retained until the end of each semi-annual period starting in
     January.
        7.9.5.3.1. The record of minor discrepancies is to be used to ensure standardization
        of AF Forms 8/8a, AF Forms 942, AF Forms 1381, AF Forms 4348, and aircrew
        member FEFs.
        7.9.5.3.2.   Record of minor discrepancies need not reside in the FEF.

          document provided the flight examiner signing Section III of the form initials the
          correction.
          7.9.5.4.2. AF Form 942. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may be
          altered without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected aircrew member
          and the contents of Section II of the FEF.
          7.9.5.4.3. AF Form 1381. As a source document, the AF Form 1381 may be
          corrected by use of white-out/over-print or pen and ink alteration of the original
          document provided the certifying official signing that line of the AF Form 1381
          initials the correction. For significant corrections, which alter the certification’s
          intent, make a new AF Form 1381 entry.
          7.9.5.4.4. AF Form 4348. As a source document, the AF Form 4348 may be
          corrected by use of white-out/over-print or pen and ink alteration of the original
          document provided the certifying official signing that line of the AF Form 4348
          initials the correction. For significant corrections, which alter the certification’s
          intent, make a new AF Form 4348 entry.

8 does not apply to X-prefix Aeromedical Evacuation crewmembers.
8.2.   Flight Surgeon.
    8.2.1. Flight Surgeon Qualification. Basic initial and periodic flight surgeon qualification
    consists of an open-book examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion
    of the basic examination, flight surgeons will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal
    qualification). MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and MDS-
    Specific flight surgeon requirements. Qualification requirements will be documented on AF
    Form 8/8a. Certification requirements will be documented on AF Forms 1381/4348.
    Qualification and certification, when required, must be accomplished before flight as an
    aircrew member.
   8.2.2. Evaluations. Flight surgeon initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required)
   examinations are considered QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this
   AFI, but may be prescribed in MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
   8.2.3. Timing of Flight Surgeon Evaluations.
        8.2.3.1. Expiration Date. The required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the
        17th month following the month in which the date of the AF Form 8/8a was successfully
        completed.
        8.2.3.2. Scheduling. Schedule the periodic evaluation in the eligibility period (6-month
        period prior to expiration date).
        8.2.3.3. Extended Evaluations. The OG/CC may extend the expiration date of the Flight
        Surgeon periodic evaluation up to three months on a case-by-case basis. Inform
        AFMSA/SGPA. Document extended evaluations IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.4
    8.2.4. Requisite Completion. MAJCOMs may establish requisites for flight surgeons as
    necessary. Requisites from a completed evaluation or an examination used for re-currency
    will not be used for subsequent evaluations. All requisites for scheduled periodic evaluations
    in the eligibility period must be completed within the 6-month eligibility period prior to the
    expiration date of the current evaluation period to update that expiration date.
    8.2.5. Grading Policies. An overall qualification level of Q-1 will be awarded upon the
    successful completion of the flight surgeon examination(s).
    8.2.6. Flight Surgeon Failure to Complete an Evaluation Within the Required Period.
    If a flight surgeon fails to complete an evaluation prior to the qualification expiration date,
    the flight surgeon loses the qualification covered by the evaluation. The flight surgeon will
    not fly as a crew member until successful completion of the delinquent evaluation.
        8.2.6.1. Qualification is re-established by successfully completing the periodic
        examination(s).

       mitigate or eliminate specific risks or trends. SIIs do not add to or amend established
       procedures. SIIs will be based on analysis of risks and trends from a variety of sources to
       include Safety Investigation Board (SIB) findings/recommendations, safety related
       incidences, trend analysis, deployed area of operations and potential problems with
       equipment/procedures.
       9.2.2. SII(s) should normally be of limited duration (i.e. not to exceed 90 days) so as to
       maintain the focus. If the situation for which the SII was issued remains, consideration
       should be given to amending current procedures and issuing corrective action via a command
       message or FCIF.
       9.2.3. SII(s) may be issued/rescinded from the MAJCOM, NAF or unit level.
       9.2.4. MAJCOM/NAF SII(s) will be issued to applicable unit OGVs in a message format
       identifying the following elements: subject/title, unique DTG, specific MDS applicability,
       references (document, SIB, etc) risk and trend details, specific emphasis actions to
       reduce/eliminate the risk or trend that is the SII topic, effective date of rescission, and
       SME/POC for further information.
       9.2.5. Units will place all MAJCOM/NAF issued SIIs into the FCIF, Current Read File,
       Part B, for dissemination to crewmembers.
       9.2.6. All current flight-related MDS-Specific and CRM/ORM related SII(s) will be briefed
       during flight briefings for the duration of the SII(s). Mission related SII(s) need only be
       briefed on those missions for which the SII is relevant.
       9.2.7. Current MAJCOM/NAF and unit issued SII(s) will be identified in Flight Crew
       Information Summary (FCIS) attachments. Units that do not publish a FCIS will maintain
       current SII(s) in Part B of their FCIF until rescinded.

  this instruction.
  9.3.2. (934AW) Go/No-Go Program. The 934 OG/OGV Go/No-Go system is an eight-
  tiered control system to insure that aircrew members have met all requirements before flight
  including currency, qualifications, ground training, FCIF, DNIF, monthly boldface, crew rest
  and crew duty day limitations. The eight tiers of the Go/No-Go control system include
  ARMS, training, scheduling, flight authorization, OGV, SOF, aircraft commander, and the
  individual crewmember. The 934 OG/OGV is responsible for maintaining, supervising, and
  verifying accomplishment of the Go/No-Go program.
     9.3.2.1. (Added-934AW) Go/No-Go Process. 934 OG Go/No Go procedures are
     detailed in 934 OG/OGV Operations Process Guide I and include procedures laid out in
     the following paragraphs.
         9.3.2.1.1. (Added-934AW) Squadron Aviation Resource Management (SARM).
         The 934 OG/OGV Go/No-Go process starts with the Aviation Resource Management
         System (ARMS). The SARM is responsible for keeping the ARMS programs updated
         with the latest currency and Duty Not Including Flying (DNIF) status information.
         Flight Authorizations will be generated using the PEX system based on squadron
         scheduling inputs. Route flight authorizations to the flight authorization official
         accompanied by a printout of all applicable aircrew members’ flight and ground
         currency. Once flight authorizations are complete, follow normal routing procedures
         to include a copy placed on the aircrew status board (ASB). Keeps the DNIF status
         updated on the Aircrew Status Board (ASB) as well.
         9.3.2.1.2. (Added-934AW) The squadron commander, operations officer, or their
         designated representative's signature on the squadron developed flight authorization
         signifies all aircrew members have been cleared for flight and that all prerequisites
         have been met. Review of ARMS currency printouts and computerized scheduling
         software (PEX) is the primary method for the flight authorizer to evaluate aircrew
         preflight requirements.
         9.3.2.1.3. (Added-934AW) The training office will be responsible for providing the
         96 AS schedulers with updated training products to supplement the information
         provided by PEX. Through the SARM, squadron training will ensure a flight and
         ground training currency report is updated weekly on the ASB.
128                      AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009


      9.3.2.1.4. (Added-934AW) The scheduling office will ensure that aircrew members
      are cleared to fly before they are added to the flight schedule in PEX. Use PEX and
      the products the SARM and Stan/Eval provide to make sure aircrew members are
      legal to fly in the position they are assigned.
      9.3.2.1.5. (Added-934AW) The supervisor of flying (SOF) is crucial to the Go/No-
      Go system. The SOF is responsible for ensuring the monthly boldface tests are
      completed and corrected prior to flight by using the Boldface binder located in Base
      Operations. After aircrew members complete their monthly boldface, initial next to
      their name on the boldface roster located on the ASB. The SOF verifies daily,
      monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually that crewmembers scheduled to fly
      have met their preflight requirements including currency, qualifications, ground
      training, and monthly boldface by checking the flight authorization against the
      products provided on the ASB. For example, monthly boldface is complete for the
      month, an instructor is present to instruct in non-current events or an unqualified
      crewmember, or aircraft egress life support training is current. After the flight
      authorization has been checked for accuracy and all aircrew members have initialed
      next to their names, initial the SOF section of the flight authorization located on the
      ASB.
      9.3.2.1.6. (Added-934AW) Aircrew members will ensure they meet the Go/No-Go
      criteria including FCIF review, boldface, certification, currency, qualification for
      scheduled events by reviewing the Letter of X’s, pubs check, and filled out their
      individual ORM. After these items are complete they will initial next to their name
      on the flight authorization. This will indicate to the A/C that they have completed all
      of their requirements. The primary aircrew member counterpart will brief applicable
      FCIF items to a crewmember joining a mission enroute.
      9.3.2.1.7. (Added-934AW) Additional Crew Members (ACM).             The aircraft
      commander will brief additional crew members on applicable FCIF and airfield threat
      and security items before flight.
      9.3.2.1.8. (Added-934AW) Visiting aircrew members. The Squadron Operations
      Officer, or designated representative, will brief visiting aircrew members on current
      FCIF items and local area restrictions/hazards. As a minimum, the visiting aircrew
      member will document review of local FCIFs by entering the last FCIF number and
      their initials behind their name on the file copy of the flight authorization.
      9.3.2.1.9. (Added-934AW) Aircraft commander's will be responsible for ensuring
      all aircrew members have initialed next to their names on the flight authorization.
      Next they will check to make sure everyone on the flight authorization is current,
      qualified, not in a DNIF status, have completed their monthly boldface and are not in
      a training status unless they are scheduled with an instructor. Once all of this has
      been verified, the A/C will sign the daily flying sheet located on the ASB. Include
      the flight authorization sheet with the packet of material turned into the SOF before
      departing to fly the mission. This packet should include flight authorization, flight
      plan, ORM and form F.
      9.3.2.1.10. (Added-934AW) OGV is responsible for oversight of the Go No-Go
      program. These duties will include occasional attendance of the daily flight schedule
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                                129


          meetings, occasional attendance of the SOF briefings, occasional reviews of aircrew
          and aircraft commander check-in procedures, occasional reviews of ASB materials,
          weekly updates to the flight evaluation overdue report, monthly crew list update to
          the boldface folder, updates to the letter of X’s as required and involvement in the
          post mission MAR reviews. In addition to the above requirements, OGV staff will
          attend the Monday flight schedule meeting to the maximum extent possible.
   9.3.3. (Added-AMC) Operational Risk Management. All units under the command and
   control of 618 TACC will utilize the standard Aviation ORM worksheet to analyze
   associated risks for all 618 TACC directed missions. This worksheet will be integrated into
   the Go/No Go process. OGV’s will maintain a hard copy of the worksheet for a period of 3
   months.
   9.3.3. (934AW) Operational Risk Management (ORM). Squadron supervision/ leadership
   will take all reasonable measures to fully ensure aircrews are ready to fly and that applicable
   risk factors have been thoroughly considered prior to any aircrew leaving the squadron to fly.
   The primary method for 934 OG ORM is the 934 OG ORM Worksheet. For missions
   supporting an AMC Mission Identifier, the ORM method is via the AMC Aviation ORM
   Worksheet. The ORM worksheet will be located in the pre-mission paperwork kit when the
   aircrew shows for flight. ORM paperwork will be filled out IAW AMCI 90-903.
       9.3.3.1. (Added-AMC) The Fatigue and Stress Scorecard will be posted in the back of
       all crewmembers checklists.

                 RECOMMENDING CHANGES TO AF PUBLICATIONS

A9.1. General. The stan/eval function is responsible for the orderly and efficient processing of
recommended changes to Air Force flying-related publications at each command level. Unless
different guidance is provided by the appropriate AF publication OPR, submit recommended
changes and improvements to Air Force publications on AF Form 847 according to the
procedures below and in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3 (covering completion of the form). Submit
recommended changes for conditions that have negative effects on operational efficiency, to
correct content errors or to recommend improved procedures or processes. Do not use the AF
Form 847 to call attention to typographical, printing or quality errors unless they cause
misinterpretation. Such deficiencies can be remedied by direct communication with the AF
publication OPR.

A9.2. Processing AF Forms 847.
   A9.2.1. Submit and process all AF Forms 847 through MAJCOM channels as outlined in
   the MAJCOM supplement to this instruction, in accordance with routing as outlined in
   Figure A9.1 and in compliance with instructions in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3. ANG units
   will utilize the NAF/MAJCOM command structure with oversight responsibility. Units will
   submit AF Forms 847 electronically to the maximum extent possible.
   A9.2.2. At each level the stan/eval function will document receipt of original AF Forms
   847, ensure the AF Form 847 reaches the appropriate functional OPR at that level for review,
   forward approved original AF Forms 847 to the next command level while informing the
   preceding command level of disposition (positive and negative) with comments. The advent
   of electronic Forms 847 may allow each level to inform all levels below (including the
   originator) of such disposition. The goal is to keep each command level and the originator
   advised of the progress and disposition of a submitted AF Form 847.
   A9.2.3. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will forward the reviewed original AF Form
   847 to the AF publication OPR. Once the AF publication OPR decides on disposition of the
   AF Form 847, the AF publication OPR will notify the submitting, parent MAJCOM as to
   disposition. The parent MAJCOM will then inform the lower command levels of the
   disposition of the original AF Form 847.
   A9.2.4. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will simultaneously forward information
   copies of AF Forms 847 to all other MAJCOMs that utilize the subject AF publication. The
   other using MAJCOMs may forward comments on the information AF Form 847 suggestions
   to the AF publication OPR.
   A9.2.5. An AF Form 847 may be disapproved by any command level reviewing the
   original AF Form 847. All disapproved recommendations will be returned to the submitting
   command level with justification annotated on the AF Form 847 stating the reason for the
   disapproval. Disapproved recommendations are not normally forwarded to other MAJCOMs,
   but may be forwarded for additional considerations if desired. MAJCOMs may address how
   to resubmit an AF Form 847 disapproved at a command level below the AF publication OPR
   in their supplement to this instruction.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_934AWSUP_I 28 DECEMBER 2009                                          185
