                                               Chapter 1
                                     PROGRAM PHILOSOPHY

1.1. Air Force Philosophy. Base school-age programs on the needs of the children, parents, and the mis-
sion of the installation. Where there are documented community needs, offer a full range of school-age
programs at reasonable and affordable fees. Include before- and after-school and full-day camp programs
that provide a safe, supervised, healthy, and age appropriate environment for children ages 6-12 years.
Programs must provide activities for children that complement rather than duplicate the school day. The
program philosophy is that school-age children grow and develop best in a supportive, interesting, and
adult-supervised environment.

1.2. Goals. The goals of school-age programs are:
   1.2.1. To provide school-age programs which enhance or reinforce lifelong leisure skills, academic
   progress, avocations, and interests to promote individual development for each child.
   1.2.2. To foster resilient, self-sufficient families and enhance military readiness, by providing ser-
   vices which reduce work-life conflicts.
   1.2.3. To reinforce family values and emphasize the unique value of each child through providing
   appropriate guidance, promoting positive attitudes, and enhancing or reinforcing self-worth.

1.3. Objectives.
   1.3.1. To provide a safe, familiar, and appropriately supervised environment for school-age children
   before and after their school day and during school holidays and summer vacations.
   1.3.2. To help participating children develop self-confidence and the ability to get along with others,
   to promote teamwork skills, and to assist in building physical and recreational skills.
   1.3.3. To offer age-appropriate activities that build upon children’s interests and ensure children’s
   safety.
   1.3.4. To create a supportive environment in which children can develop independence and
   life-skills.
   1.3.5. To provide activities and guidance which promote responsibility and concern for others.
   1.3.6. To maintain an atmosphere which encourages flexibility and allows for children’s freedom of
   choice within appropriate guidelines.

1.4. Program Benefits. School-age care programs benefit youths by helping them develop to their full-
est potential, contributing to self-worth, and assisting in resisting negative pressures. School-age pro-
grams benefit parents of youth by allowing them to feel comfortable about their children’s happiness and
well-being while they are on duty or at work. School-age programs contribute to the Air Force mission by
allowing parents to be more productive, secure in the knowledge that their children are being cared about
and supervised.

1.5. Program Scope. The program includes before- and after-school, check-in, and full day camp pro-
grams for children 6-12 years of age. Offer programs before school, after school, and all day during


                                                6
school holidays, teacher in-service days, and during school vacations to meet local needs. Design pro-
grams to serve elementary and middle school children, ages 6-12. The program may be offered to kinder-
gartners who cannot be accommodated in the child development center. Part-day camps, short duration
specialty camps, resident camps, or full-day camp programs for older youths may be offered. Guidance
for these latter programs is not offered in this manual.

                              OPERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION

2.1. Policy. AFI 34-249, Youth Programs, provides policy guidance for program requirements. Manage-
ment of the school-age program is the responsibility of the youth director. Operational aspects of the pro-
gram may be delegated to the school-age program coordinator, the before- and after-school program
coordinator or the day camp director, as applicable.
   2.1.1. School-Age Program Standards. AFI 34-249 requires compliance with the School-Age Pro-
   gram Standards. Use the standards to plan and assess programs and improve activities.

2.2. Program Operational Procedures. AFI 34-249 provides policy on operating instructions (OIs).
Establish OIs as needed for the program’s day-to-day operation. Topics such as the following may be
covered by local OIs for each program:
   2.2.1. Hours of operation (e.g., opening/closing times, holiday closures).
   2.2.2. Financial policies (e.g., parent fees, late pick-up fees, special event fees, transportation, and
   refund and fee payment policies).
   2.2.3. Medical/Health (e.g., emergency procedures for accidents and injuries, conditions for sending
   ill children home, administration of medication).
   2.2.4. Emergency procedures (e.g., fire prevention and evacuation, plans for release of children,
   disaster preparedness).
   2.2.5. Termination of enrollment (e.g., terms under which children may be disenrolled).
   2.2.6. Discipline procedures (e.g., recommended methods of behavior management and unacceptable
   guidance practices).
   2.2.7. Child abuse/neglect reporting (e.g., who must report, to whom, and under what circumstances).
   2.2.8. Transportation and field trips (e.g., means of transport, permission, and notification).
   2.2.9. Coordination of medical OIs with the program medical advisor and other OIs with the appro-
   priate base agencies.

2.3. Children’s Records. Maintain an individual file folder for each child. Enrollment forms are pre-
scribed in AFI 34-249.
   2.3.1. Request for Service. Parents requesting service must complete DD Form 2606, DoD Child
   Development Program Request for Care Record. When a program has no space available, contact
   the parent every 2 months to update the need for care. If hourly care is offered, use AF Form 1929,
   Child Development Center Daily Reservation Log, to take reservations for the program.
   2.3.2. Permanent Record Information. The AF Form 1181, Air Force Youth Flight Program
   Patron Registration, must be on file before a child can enter the program. The school-age program
   coordinator must ensure this form is updated at least annually at the beginning of the school year to
   assure the emergency information is correct and current.
   2.3.3. Family Care Plan. For children of single parents and dual military couples, a copy of the
   sponsor’s AF Form 357, Dependent Care Certification, must be maintained in the child’s file folder.

                                                 8
   2.3.4. Immunizations. Children currently enrolled in a public or private elementary school are not
   required to present an immunization record. For other children, the child’s official immunization
   record is required to show compliance with the current immunizations required by AF policy and the
   American Academy of Pediatrics for children of their age. Record information on the AF Form 1181.
   2.3.5. Special Health Information. Information about any special health conditions that the child
   has, such as allergies or asthma, must be recorded on AF Form 1181. Post children’s special health
   needs in the kitchen in a convenient location where the staff can see them, yet the confidentiality of
   the children is protected.
   2.3.6. Children with Special Needs. Modify the environment, staffing, and activities within reason
   to let children with special needs participate. Accept children with special health problems only with
   the concurrence of the family member support flight chief and the program medical advisor. Establish
   a committee composed of the program medical advisor, family member support flight chief, youth
   director, and judge advocate representative to review any case in question and make a recommenda-
   tion to the support group commander to determine the appropriate placement. If any additional
   expenses are incurred that are not reimbursed by an external agency, include them in the cost of the
   program for all users.
   2.3.7. Transportation Agreement. Require the parent or guardian to provide a signed agreement
   outlining the plan for transporting the child to and from the program site and the child's school site.
   The program should maintain on file written permission from the parents for the children to go to and
   from school on school-furnished transportation or by center-furnished transportation.
   2.3.8. Participation in Other Activities. Permit a child, age 9 or over, to leave the program to par-
   ticipate in other after-school youth programs, or community youth programs such as Scouting, with
   written parental permission including a transportation agreement. For children 6 through 8, designate
   an adult or sibling 14 years old or older, authorized to pick up and sign out the child as listed on the
   AF Form 1181. When the program provides transportation or escort service to the other activity, have
   the designated adult listed on the AF Form 1181 sign the child out at the activity site. An AF Form
   1930, Youth Flight Daily Attendance Record, can be used for this purpose.

2.4. Arrival and Departure. In most cases the children participating in school-age programs will be
brought to the program by their parents in the morning and depart by leaving with their parents at the end
of the day. Children should be signed in and out by their parent at the beginning and end of the day. Use
either AF Form 1182, Youth Flight Register or AF Form 1930 for signing children in and out of the pro-
gram. Children participating in the before- and after-school program will leave the program in the morn-
ing for school by either bus, walking, or bicycle, return to the program after school by bus, walking, or
bicycle, and depart by leaving with their parent at the end of the day. When departing for school and
returning from school, the children should sign themselves in and out. Children under 6 years of age must
arrive and depart under adult supervision. Children 6 through 8 years of age may walk to and from school
alone or with other children with written permission of the parents. Children 9 years old or older may
arrive and depart from the program with written permission from the parents. Children under 9 years of
age must be brought by and picked up by a parent, other designated adult, or sibling 14 years old or older.

2.5. Fees. AFI 34-249 provides guidance on fees for school-age programs. The cost of meals and snacks
must be included in this fee. For occasional specialty full-day camps, where specialists are involved as
instructors, rates may be higher, but should be reasonable.

                                                9
2.6. Contingency Operations. When an emergency, such as a natural disaster or conflict, occurs on the
installation or in the local area, the commander may suspend school-age program operations. If condi-
tions permit, continue to offer the same program and consider increasing services to support employed
parents. The commander may authorize parents or other volunteers to supplement the staff in order to
maintain ratios and food service during emergencies.




                                             10
                                               Chapter 3
                         DESIGNING THE PROGRAM ENVIRONMENT

3.1. Determining Space Needs. Determine the base’s need for school-age programs by using the current
Department of Defense formula for determining child care need (AFI 34-248, Child Development Pro-
grams, attachment 5) and the program waiting list. A waiting list should be maintained and used in pro-
jecting the need for additional school-age services.
   3.1.1. Before- and After-School Program Space. The program may be housed in the youth center,
   the child development center, in other base buildings or in off-base schools that meet fire, health, and
   safety requirements. The space may be dedicated to only the program or it may be shared space. Pro-
   vide a warm and home-like atmosphere. Provide space so children can play individually, together in
   small groups, or in a large group. The interest areas must support children’s ability to make choices
   and be age-appropriate. Provide space for a variety of interest areas which collectively provide
   enough space for all the children enrolled. Arrange the space so various activities can go on at the
   same time without disrupting one another. Adapt the interest areas to match the curriculum. Provide
   areas such as a table area for board/table games and manipulatives; a music center; an arts and crafts
   area; a woodworking area; a dramatic play area; a science and nature discovery area; a block and con-
   struction area; a quiet area with books and magazines; a homework area with academic resources; a
   computer area, a snack and cooking area; and a comfortable, conversation area. Daily observations of
   the children provide important clues as to what changes are needed in the environment.
   3.1.2. Indoor School-Age Program Space. Establish a room or area in the facility as a home base
   for the program or as a self-contained space. If a home base with supporting indoor facilities is used,
   a minimum of 20 net square feet of usable space per child is required. Usable space is defined as an
   uninterrupted activity space that excludes closets, in-room toilets, built-in equipment such as cubbies,
   and dedicated in-room circulation space that cannot be used for activities. Each self-contained room,
   where the children spend the majority of the time, must have at least 35 net square feet of usable space
   per child. In constructing new facilities provide 35 net square feet of usable space per child in the
   home base. If several rooms are used to support the program, there must be at least 35 net square feet
   per child in the total space. Provide adequate space to prevent crowding and the potential for acci-
   dents. The physical design and use of the building must permit visual monitoring of the children in
   the program. Provide indoor space to promote the children’s well-being. Provide sufficient lighting
   levels to permit youth to do homework and/or work on hobbies and crafts. Provide access to drinking
   water, handwashing sinks and toilet facilities, a telephone, and kitchen in every facility used for the
   program. If meals and snacks are prepared in another facility and delivered to the program, provide a
   receiving kitchen or area for the food delivery and service. Control hot water temperature so as not to
   exceed 120 degrees F. at outlets used by children.
   3.1.3. Day Camp Program Space. Use a variety of facilities and outdoor areas for day camp pro-
   grams. The youth center may be the primary home base facility for the day camp program, but other
   facilities that lend themselves to use for leisure activities should also be used. Specialized facilities
   may be required; for example, playing courts are required if tennis or basketball is included in the cur-
   riculum. Dance studio and/or stage, or similar space will be required for a performing arts specialized
   day camp.
   3.1.4. Outdoor Program Space. AFI 34-249 provides guidance for establishing outdoor program
   facilities. In new facilities, a playground should be located near or adjacent to the youth center unless

                                                11
   a school playground or park is available for the same purpose. Provide transportation if the play-
   ground is more than 1/8th of a mile away from the program site. Have a minimum of 75 square feet
   of outdoor play space for each child playing in the area at one time. Design the play area to permit a
   variety of activities throughout the year. Provide some type of shade on each playground. Any play-
   ground equipment installed must be age appropriate and comply with the U.S. Consumer Product
   Safety Commission Playground Guidelines of Oct 91 or the latest edition and American Society for
   Testing and Materials Playground Standards. Other outdoor areas, such as playing fields, swimming
   pools, tennis courts, and multi-purpose courts may be used to offer new outdoor play experiences.

3.2. Use of Space. Provide interest areas capable of accommodating a variety of simultaneous activities.
In any school-age program there must be a designated place for parents to sign children in and out, to
receive and leave messages, and to gain access to program and community information. Provide individ-
ual storage space for children’s personal belongings, homework, etc.
   3.2.1. Shared Space Agreement. A written agreement outlining specific responsibilities of the pro-
   gram and specific responsibilities of the host agency is required when using space in other facilities
   such as schools. The agreement must cover all space to be used by the program; inclusive dates and
   times; furniture, supplies, equipment and storage; telephone and other utilities; opening and closing
   procedures; cleanup and maintenance; lines of communication and fee, if there is a charge.
   3.2.2. Shared Space Environment. Make the environment a pleasant place for children even when
   it is a shared facility. If the program is operating in a large open space such as a gymnasium or cafe-
   teria, create "cozy" areas by using area rugs, lightweight folding mats or dividers, portable signs or
   bulletin boards. To create a comfortable environment, use soft elements such as carpeting, cushions,
   and brightly colored cloth over tables. Provide portable storage cabinets for personal belongings and
   supplies and equipment. Provide movable surfaces such as rolling chalk boards or easels to display
   children’s art work.
       3.2.2.1. Minimizing Storage Problems. Utilize available storage space as efficiently as possible
       by keeping it neat and organized. In shared space rolling storage cabinets are a necessity for stor-
       ing materials. Portable storage can also be created with items such as plastic crate cubes. Involve
       the children in maintaining storage areas.
       3.2.2.2. Daily Set-up. Allow sufficient staff time for the daily program set-up and tear-down.
       When possible, use uniformly sized labeled boxes for storage of games and materials. Utility carts
       are useful to move items to the needed areas. Make some aspects of set-up and tear-down part of
       the daily program of the children. Make sure any set-up or tear-down tasks are within the capabil-
       ity of the children involved and can be performed safely by children.

3.3. Supplies, Materials, and Equipment. Provide children a wide variety of materials, supplies, and
equipment that reflect their interests and needs and support their development. Purchase durable materi-
als and equipment that can withstand the active play of school-age children. The equipment and furniture
must be sized for children 6-12 years of age.
   3.3.1. Program Equipment. Tables and chairs must be supplied for children to use while doing
   homework, eating, and playing table games. A place for every child to sit at the same time is not
   required. Ensure chairs and tables are the correct height for 6-12-year-olds. Provide low shelving for
   display of play materials so that they are accessible to children. Suggestions for equipment are at
   Attachment 2.

                                               12
3.3.2. Supplies and Materials. Provide a variety of age-appropriate materials to support diverse
activities. Select safe toys, such as those with rounded edges, nontoxic paint, and nonflammable
materials. Solicit ideas for game choices from the children in the program. Provide a variety of mate-
rials and displays that promote cultural diversity. Toys, books and posters must reflect the ethnic,
racial, cultural and gender differences of the children within the program. Include items which teach
children about the culture of the Air Force. Suggestions for supplies and materials are at Attachment
3.

                                       PROGRAM STAFFING

4.1. Staff/Volunteers. People selected to work in school-age programs must be screened according to
AFI 34-249. During the first 6 months of employment, require completion of certification in first aid, car-
diopulmonary resuscitation and food handler’s certification. Individuals must have good physical and
mental health, and be free of tuberculosis and other communicable diseases. The Aerospace Medical
Council of the local medical treatment facility must determine the health requirements of staff and volun-
teers. Staff must not use illegal drugs, alcohol, or tobacco products while working with children.
   4.1.1. Personnel Restrictions/Prohibitions. No employees or specified volunteers may be
   employed or work with children until the Installation Records Check (IRC) is completed. Conduct an
   IRC on specified volunteers with a DoD affiliation such as living or working on an installation or
   being an active duty member or family member. Upon favorable completion of the IRC, an individual
   may be selected and participate in the program. Conduct a State Criminal History Repository (SCHR)
   check for each staff member or contractor. Until the National Agency Check (NAC) or National
   Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI) is completed, employees, or contractors must work in the pres-
   ence of an individual who has a completed NAC or NACI or be continuously supervised through the
   use of a closed circuit television system by a person who has a completed NAC or NACI. Do not per-
   mit individuals who have committed substantiated child abuse or neglect or who are in the process of
   being evaluated for alleged abuse or neglect to be employed in Air Force School-Age Programs.
   4.1.2. Staff Continuity. Schedule staff to ensure consistency in the adults who will be supervising
   the children and providing care and leadership for a specific group of children. Make every effort to
   ensure each child is supervised by the same persons daily. Have trained substitutes who meet the
   basic training requirements available when the regular staff members are absent.

4.2. Supervision of Children. Follow policies on supervising youth in AFI 34-249. Provide an ade-
quate number of staff to protect the health and safety of the children, meet the needs of individual chil-
dren, and implement the program of activities. Post the name of the on-site program supervisor currently
on duty in indoor facilities. Each staff member may not have more than 12 children for whom he or she
is personally responsible. The names of the children for whom the staff member is responsible must be
posted and recorded on the AF Form 1930, Youth Flight Daily Attendance Record. The children for
whom the staff member is responsible do not have to be in their sight at all times, but the staff member
must know where the children are. Either the child must check in with the staff member frequently or the
staff member must check on the children. All areas in use by children must be supervised by at least one
adult. Teens, ages 16-18, may volunteer in day camp programs or be employed as summer hires to serve
as junior counselors, but must never be allowed total supervision or unsupervised access to children. The
staff must know when children are expected to arrive at the program site and have a system to quickly
check on late arrivals or absences.
   4.2.1. Confidentiality. The program coordinator, staff, and volunteers must keep information about
   children, families, and other staff confidential. Ensure staff or volunteers do not comment about chil-
   dren, families, or other staff in the presence of other adults or children.
   4.2.2. Staff/Child Ratios. Follow the ratios prescribed in AFI 34-249. Volunteers and persons under
   age 18 may not be counted in staff/child ratios or be allowed to be alone with children (see paragraph
   2.6 for contingency operations exception). Staff-child ratios and group sizes vary according to the

                                                14
   type and complexity of the activity. Within the group size of 24 children, the group leader and assis-
   tant group leader may deviate from the staff-child ratio size of 12 children each in order to match
   needed supervision levels. No more than two groups (48 children) may share an expanded open space
   of two rooms or set of interest areas. If interest areas are set up in several rooms, this space may be
   shared by more than 48 children. If a gymnasium is used for program space accommodating more
   than 48 children, provide an additional set of interest areas. One set of interest areas could serve ages
   6-8 while the second set could serve ages 9-12. Have children spend most of their day in groups no
   larger than double the staff/child ratio (24).

4.3. Filling Positions. Recruiting and hiring NAF personnel is handled through the Human Resources
Office (HRO). This office will assist in referring candidates for screening, interview, and selection.
   4.3.1. Interviewing Candidates. The family member support flight chief, youth director, and
   school-age coordinator should select child-oriented people who are committed to delivering a quality
   program. Compare candidates by using specific questions and conducting a patterned interview.
   Clear the specific questions with the HRO. Use open-ended questions so that the candidate reveals
   characteristics such as sensitivity and concern for children, judgment, oral communication skills, team
   work and cooperation, adaptability, enthusiasm, and high energy level. Sample questions designed to
   help reveal a candidate’s skills in these areas are at attachment 4.
   4.3.2. Checking References. The family member support flight chief, youth director, or school-age
   coordinator should check at least two previous employers of each candidate who will be employed or
   regularly volunteer in the program. Be sure the applicant has given permission on the application to
   contact the current or previous supervisors. Use open ended questions when talking with a previous
   employer. Possible questions to ask during a reference check are at Attachment 5. Document
   responses with date, who was contacted, and simple "O.K." or "Not O.K." to indicate whether or not
   the previous employer gave a positive recommendation.
   4.3.3. Selecting an Applicant. Select the candidate deemed to fulfill the needs most effectively.
   Some qualities to consider are:
       4.3.3.1. Knowledge and understanding of the unique needs and characteristics of school-age
       youths.
       4.3.3.2. Possession of diverse skills and talents that can be shared with the children.
       4.3.3.3. A professional attitude and seriousness about the requirements of the job.
       4.3.3.4. Ability and desire to utilize positive guidance methods with children.
       4.3.3.5. Desire and potential for growth in the school-age field.
   4.3.4. Staff/Volunteer Training. The youth director, or the school-age coordinator if designated, is
   responsible for implementing the training program and maintaining the records related to training.
   Develop an individual training plan for each staff member at the time of initial employment. If chil-
   dren with special needs are enrolled in the school-age program, provide staff training on program
   modification and activities to meet the needs of the children. The training and curriculum specialist
   assigned to the school-age program is responsible for assisting the youth director and school-age coor-
   dinator with the training program. Areas of assistance may include helping to develop the individual
   training plans and the tracking system, conducting knowledge and competency assessments, conduct-
   ing weekly or monthly training sessions, and work with staff having difficulty completing the mod-

                                                15
   ules. The training and curriculum specialist may also provide staff training on meeting the needs of
   children with special needs.
       4.3.4.1. Orientation. The school-age coordinator must implement an orientation and training
       program for staff and regularly scheduled volunteers. All staff and volunteers are required to
       complete orientation training prior to working with children. Basic goals of the orientation pro-
       cess, and required and suggested topics are provided in Attachment 6. The orientation should
       introduce the Services’ Quality Air Force criteria for improving daily operations through continu-
       ous improvement processes. Each staff member and regular volunteer must receive training dur-
       ing orientation and at least annually on how to prevent and report suspected child abuse and
       neglect. Require staff and regularly scheduled volunteers to complete 4 hours of observation prior
       to being assigned to work with children.
       4.3.4.2. Staff Working with Children. Use the Department of Defense School-Age Training
       Modules to train all individuals employed in the school-age program including school-age coordi-
       nators, site coordinators, school-age program assistants, and others who are counted in meeting
       staff/child ratios in school-age programs. Provide a reasonable amount of paid training time to
       complete the modules. Require staff, who work with children, to complete the modules within the
       first 18 months of employment. Include a review of this manual in the training. Twelve hours of
       training annually for all school-age program staff is required after the school-age training modules
       are completed. This training must include annual training on child abuse prevention and report-
       ing. Include positive guidance techniques, acceptable and unacceptable ways of touching, talking
       to and handling children in the training. Additional training is required to maintain CPR and first
       aid certification.
       4.3.4.3. Volunteers and Contract Personnel. Regularly scheduled volunteers who participate in
       the program on a weekly basis and contractors who are used to meet staff/child ratios must also
       complete the school-age program training modules. Contract personnel equivalent training may
       be substituted for required training. Train one-time special event volunteers on specific tasks
       related to their responsibilities.
       4.3.4.4. Other Employees. Food service staff must receive at least 6 hours of annual training on
       sanitation, nutrition, food preparation and service, and related subjects. Administrative staff must
       receive at least 6 hours of annual training on administrative procedures, customer service, child
       abuse prevention, and related subjects.

4.4. Evaluations. The program supervisor must keep written employee evaluations confidential and hold
discussions in private with the employee. Use observations of the person working with children as part of
staff evaluations. The program supervisor must inform staff of the criteria that will be used to evaluate
their performance in advance and give them opportunities to assess their own performance as part of the
evaluation process. Hold staff meetings at least monthly; small group meetings may be utilized to meet
this requirement.

4.5. Employee Work Files. Maintain confidential employee work files for all employees including cop-
ies of OF Form 612, Optional Application for Federal Employment, or equivalent, results of calls for
references, training records, performance evaluations, and results of criminal history background checks,
and immunizations. All training must be documented on the AF Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee
Brief, or AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training.

                                      PROGRAM MARKETING

5.1. Promotion and Marketing. The school-age coordinator should seek assistance from the Services
marketing specialist in developing and implementing a marketing plan that will support families’ ability to
choose the arrangement they prefer. Ensure the marketing plan identifies the non-school care needs of the
population to be served, programs that meet those needs effectively, and methods to inform families about
the existence and nature of the program.

5.2. Program Evaluation. The program director will evaluate program effectiveness by reviewing the
CORPORATE PRISM data and periodically conducting a review of parents’ and children’s perceptions
about the program and their suggestions for improvement. Use the Assessing School-Age Quality Pro-
gram or a comparable system to conduct this review. Include questions about the parents’ satisfaction
with the hours of operation during deployments, exercises, and inspections on the surveys.

6.1. Group Management/Discipline. Follow AFI 34-249 guidance for establishing rules of conduct for
youth and adults. AFI 34-249 prescribes acceptable and unacceptable methods of discipline and the
requirement for a child guidance policy. The program director will establish and implement a guidance
policy as follows:
   6.1.1. Put the guidance policy in writing and at the beginning of each program year distribute it to
   parents and staff, and post it in each facility used for the program.
   6.1.2. Make sure each staff member reads and signs a statement that he or she understands the policy.
   6.1.3. Do not permit staff or volunteers who violate the child guidance policy to have access to chil-
   dren until they have been retrained.
   6.1.4. Assign individuals who violate the child guidance policy to positions where they do not have
   contact with children or place them on administrative leave until they are retrained or terminated.

6.2. Promoting Positive Behavior Through Planning. Minimize behavior problems through program
design and planning. Maximize opportunities to promote positive behavior.
   6.2.1. Activity Planning. Provide enough materials and equipment for activities so that conflicts
   over limited resources will be minimized. Offer a wide variety of fun and challenging activities which
   address children’s interests and offer appropriate choices. Encourage child-initiated activities.
   Remember that children who are busy with activities they enjoy are far less likely to exhibit inappro-
   priate behavior than children who are bored.
   6.2.2. Arranging and Using Space. Avoid physically overlapping conflicting activities. Clearly
   define activity areas and the rules for their use. Locate areas so that interference from other activities
   will be minimized (e.g., noise level or traffic patterns). Post the number of youth that can be in each
   area in order to minimize accidents and conflicts and permit youth to regulate their own behavior.
   6.2.3. Staff Interaction. Staff must treat children of all races, religions, and cultures equally, show-
   ing respect and consideration. To elicit cooperation, give children choices rather than directives. To
   encourage children to act in appropriate ways, make requests of children rather than issuing orders to
   them. Staff must model the kind of behaviors they want from children, such as saying "please,"
   "thank you," and "excuse me," admitting errors gracefully, and treating others kindly.
   6.2.4. Flexibility. Group leaders must be prepared to put aside a planned activity and find a way to
   address children’s current needs. Group leaders must maintain flexibility and have a "Plan B" activity
   they can use as the situation requires.

6.3. Group Management Skills. Staff and volunteers must have the ability to deal with children in dif-
ferent stages of development. Group leaders should use group management skills to guide children’s
behavior.
   6.3.1. Establishing Rules. In cooperation with the children, the school-age coordinator should
   develop a short list of basic rules to guide the children’s behavior in the program. Make these rules



                                                18
   easy for children to understand and remember. State the rules in positive rather than negative terms,
   e.g., "be kind to others" rather than "no hitting, biting, pushing, pinching, etc."
   6.3.2. Positive Reinforcement. The school-age staff should use a positive reinforcement system that
   will increase the chances a child will choose to behave in a desirable manner in the future. Include
   tangible and social reinforcers. Choose reinforcers that are meaningful to the children. Avoid tangi-
   ble reinforcers, such as candy, that reinforce poor eating habits. Provide social reinforcement such as
   "thank you" as often as possible but give other types of reinforcers on a "variable schedule" so chil-
   dren do not come to attach good behavior to a reward each time. Change the type of reinforcement
   system periodically for positive reinforcement to be effective.
   6.3.3. Handling Surface Behavior. Group leaders must be alert to situations that can lead to behav-
   ioral problems. The following methods should be used in responding to minor behavioral problems:
       6.3.3.1. Redirection. If a child is getting restless or a conflict is beginning, a leader can direct that
       child’s attention to an activity that will take him/her out of a potentially troublesome situation.
       6.3.3.2. Proximity. Just moving to stand next to a child who is beginning to act inappropriately
       will often lead children to think about what they are doing and choose a more appropriate way to
       meet their needs.
       6.3.3.3. Using a child’s name. Calling a child’s name (in a voice that lets him/her know you are
       aware of his/her actions) may help a child regulate his or her own behavior and become reinvolved
       in the activity in progress.
   6.3.4. Conflict Resolution Skills. Show children that conflicts can be settled through problem solv-
   ing and negotiation techniques. Create a cooperative atmosphere in the program by including games
   and activities that stress cooperation rather than competition. Plan activities that require group coop-
   eration for successful completion and have group discussions about ways to cooperatively solve prob-
   lems. School-age program assistants must model effective "WIN-WIN" problem solving methods to
   help children solve conflicts and find solutions that allow everyone involved to get some of what they
   want.

6.4. Disciplinary Techniques. School-age program assistants must know and use a variety of effective
and positive techniques to guide children’s behavior.
   6.4.1. Warnings. For maximum effectiveness, warnings must be given only once. When a warning
   is given, it must contain three specific messages: what the child is doing specifically that needs to
   stop; what specifically will be the consequence if the child chooses to continue in his or her current
   behavior; and what the child can do to meet his or her needs in an acceptable way. If the child chooses
   to continue his or her behavior, the leader must follow through with the consequence stated in the
   warning.
   6.4.2. Removing From Activity. Removing a child for a short time from the action of the program
   can work well in some situations, but must not be used as the answer to all discipline problems.
   6.4.3. Removal of Privileges. The removal of a privilege which is enjoyed by the child and which is
   linked in his or her mind with the inappropriate behavior can also be used. The amount of time for
   which the privilege is removed should vary with the developmental level of the child. Match the priv-
   ilege being removed to the specific misbehavior so the two become tied together in the child's mind.


                                                  19
   6.4.4. Parent’s Follow Through. If the techniques described above do not help the child change his
   or her behavior, ask the child’s parent or parents to follow through with consequences at home which
   may be more significant to the child. Help the parent set up both positive consequences to be earned
   through improved behavior and negative consequences to follow inappropriate behavior. Include the
   child in the final agreement so everyone knows what is expected.

6.5. Issues Affecting Behavior. Staff must be aware of family issues and the effect they have on chil-
dren's behavior. Resource materials on divorce and blended families, family violence, child abuse, eating
disorders, substance abuse, loss and grief, learning disabilities, and gang pressures should be available for
staff and parents and the information incorporated into staff training. The medical treatment facility staff
should collaborate with the staff and help families find professional help with family problems if it is
needed.

                                           PROGRAM DESIGN

7.1. School-Age Programs. School-age programs support single and dual working parents by providing
access to full-day supervised care for their children. The school-age coordinator must develop a written
statement that reflects the program’s philosophy and goals and make it available to children and parents.
Also develop and either publish or post a mission and vision statement for the program.

7.2. Basic Needs and Age Characteristics. Consider age group characteristics of school-age children
when developing the curriculum. The program must provide for the following needs of school-age chil-
dren:
The need to:
   7.2.1. Interact with their peers.
   7.2.2. Feel a sense of security in daily routines.
   7.2.3. Learn and practice new skills.
   7.2.4. Produce meaningful and useful things.
   7.2.5. Make choices about their own activities.
   7.2.6. Have their physical needs for food and rest met.

7.3. Curriculum. Curriculum design involves planning, implementation, and evaluation of activities,
materials and equipment, and schedules. The program curriculum includes all of the experiences the chil-
dren have while in the program.

7.4. Developmentally Appropriate Activities. Activities should meet the developmental needs of chil-
dren and provide them with opportunities for active play, fun, and relaxation. Emphasize activities which
children will probably not have the opportunity to enjoy in their own homes. The daily activities reflect
the cultures of the children in the program. Avoid duplicating holiday experiences that children will have
with their own families. Children may watch television while attending the program; however, alterna-
tive play activities should always be provided. Limit the use of media such as television, films, and vid-
eotapes to those that are developmentally appropriate and support the program philosophy. Viewing
should be limited to programs designed for children or for family viewing. Videos available for children
must be “G” rated. Group the children within the program so specific activities may be planned to meet
their needs. The appropriate groups are kindergarten, primary (grades 1 and 2), intermediate (grades 3
and 4), and transition (grades 5 and 6). Use the following criteria to select activities:
   7.4.1. Provide opportunities for success at various skill levels.
   7.4.2. Reflect the children's expressed interests.
   7.4.3. Incorporate "hands-on" learning and opportunities for exploration.
   7.4.4. Allow for cooperation and group participation.
   7.4.5. Produce a result that the child perceives as meaningful.


                                                21
7.5. Daily Schedules. All programs must have a daily schedule that gives children a sense of security,
independence, stimulation, and knowledge of what they can expect from their day. The daily schedule
should be flexible. Children should be allowed to move smoothly from one activity to another of their
choice, usually at their own pace. A choice board or other procedure may be used to limit the number of
children using a specific area. Children should be able to meet their physical needs in a relaxed way.
When children leave the room to go to the bathroom, they should note this on the choice or planning board
if this technique is used in the program so the staff responsible for them know where they are. In full day
camp programs, a group rotation system may also be used to facilitate different activity experiences.
While it is not required to post the daily schedule, it is helpful to children, parents, and staff to have it
posted.

7.6. Weekly Activity Plans. Develop a weekly activity plan to ensure the program is using a wide vari-
ety of activities and program elements. A sample Weekly Activity Plan is shown in Attachment 7. The
skills/objectives for the specific activity may be recorded on the Activity Plan or a planning book may
also be used for the weekly plan and the skills/objectives for the specific activities. These plans should be
kept on file for one year.

7.7. Activity Plans. In addition to the Weekly Activity Plan, an activity plan may be written for each spe-
cific directed activity of the day. A sample activity plan is shown in Attachment 8.

7.8. Planning for Change. Plan for smooth, unregimented transitions between activities. Use transition
activities to reduce boredom and keep the spirit of fun going as the program moves from one game, activ-
ity, or play space to another. Avoid children waiting in lines, waiting for food to be served, waiting for a
new activity to start, etc. and other time-wasters that reduce the quality of the experience for children.
Use "Back Pocket Game" cards for ideas for transition times. Teach these games to the children during
normal activity times so the children are familiar with the rules and are able to play right away during
transitions. An example of a "Back Pocket Game" card is atAttachment 9.

7.9. Choice Board. Use a choice board or other system to allow children to move smoothly from one
activity to another and help staff supervise the children. The system should allow children to choose what
they want to do and also limit the number of children using a specific interest area. A choice board or
other system also is useful to identify the children for whom each staff member is responsible.

                      BEFORE- AND AFTER-SCHOOL (B&AS) PROGRAM

8.1. B&AS Program. The B&AS program must provide supervised experiences for school children in
kindergarten through sixth grade during non-school hours when parents are at work. Take into account
the stresses of the child’s daily life when planning activities and schedules. Allow plenty of time for the
children to relax, initiate activities, and move through them at a comfortable pace. Place the program
focus on leisure activities, rather than academic pursuits. Provide children informal ways to use academic
skills in play activities and continue to learn following their own interests and curiosity. Provide time and
space for children to do homework before they return home if that is their parents’ preference.

8.2. Planning Process. Gather input from the staff, children and their parents about the types of activities
and schedules that are needed in the program. A yearly plan of monthly themes can be developed. These
themes can be further divided into sub-themes as a tool in planning weekly activities.

8.3. Daily Schedule. A sample day-to-day schedule for a before- and after-school program is shown in
attachment 10. Provide options for participation in either planned or self-chosen activities. Allow chil-
dren who quickly lose interest to move on to other activities while encouraging children to fully explore
play opportunities. During all periods of the day, make a variety of materials and equipment available.
Children may elect to read or just sit quietly at times during the day.
   8.3.1. The following elements should be included in the program schedule:
       8.3.1.1. Opportunities for outdoor, active play (weather permitting) or indoor active play if the
       weather does not permit outdoor play.
       8.3.1.2. Choices of planned activities (e.g., art, music, science, fitness, etc.).
       8.3.1.3. Snacks (after school) and meals (if present at meal times).
       8.3.1.4. Independent activities or rest.
       8.3.1.5. An opportunity to do homework and receive tutoring.
       8.3.1.6. Opportunities to socialize.
   8.3.2. Homework. Schedule at least 30 minutes in the afternoon for homework or alternate activities
   for those who do not need homework time. Homework assistance should be in partnership with par-
   ents, and not be a replacement for parental responsibility. Confer with parents to learn how the time
   can be used to be most helpful to the child. Monitor and assist children, as needed, in doing home-
   work to a point where a parent can then review it with the child. Contacting the school for recommen-
   dations from the teachers should remain a parent responsibility.
   8.3.3. Balanced Program. Use activities and/or themes to offer experiences for children with a wide
   variety of skills and interests. Allow all of the children to both operate in their areas of strength and
   stretch themselves into new areas. Include the following in the curriculum:
       8.3.3.1. Cognitive activities that stimulate children's thinking and intellectual abilities such as sci-
       ence experiments, logic puzzles, or problem solving games.
       8.3.3.2. Physical activities that allow development of large and small muscle coordination such as
       physical games, fine motor art projects, or physical fitness activities.

                                                  23
      8.3.3.3. Self and social awareness activities that help children get to know and understand them-
      selves and others better such as cooperation games, multi-cultural/anti-bias activities, self-por-
      traits, or group discussions.
      8.3.3.4. Creative activities that provide children with opportunities to express themselves in
      "non-programmed" projects that draw inspiration from within themselves such as music, dramat-
      ics, working with art media, creative writing, or dance.
      8.3.3.5. Recreational activities that help children develop or practice interests that can be pursued
      outside the B&AS program such as craft activities, collector’s clubs, learning new games or sports.
   8.3.4. Balanced Weekly Schedule. Give consideration to the physical, social-emotional, and cogni-
   tive skills of children when deciding which activities are appropriate for different age groups. Con-
   sider the program elements and frequencies shown in Table 8.1. in designing a balanced program.

   8.3.5. Prop Boxes. Maintain packaged kits to use with a specific theme or when a "ready-to-go"
   activity is needed. For example, a prop box may support a dramatic play situation such as a "pretend"
   office, restaurant, beauty or barbershop, or other program materials such as an art project. Materials
   must be safe and appropriate for the age and ability levels of the participants.
   8.3.6. Club Program. Introduce children to exciting new hobbies and interests through specialty
   subject clubs. Consider children’s interests, available space, and leadership when determining club
   program choices. The club program curriculum should be age appropriate for the participants. Chil-
   dren should select clubs based on their choice. Provide an atmosphere where children are free to
   explore their interests. The adult leader should act as a facilitator, providing ideas and direction. The
   frequency of club meetings is flexible. The duration of a specialty club will be determined by the chil-
   dren’s interest.

                                         CHECK-IN PROGRAM

9.1. Check-In Program. As an optional program, offer an after school check-in program for older chil-
dren, 10 years of age and older. Design this program to provide young adolescents with flexible and
appropriate supervision by caring, trained adults. Within the program, provide opportunities for young
adolescents to make creative and constructive use of their free time and to become independent and
responsible by planning and participating in activities on their own. Ensure the program provides work-
ing parents with the support they need to combine work and family responsibilities. Require the parent to
sign an agreement which makes clear the responsibilities of the program, the parents, and the youth.
   9.1.1. Program Choices. Develop a system that allows youth to report to a check-in location, to be
   greeted, have a chance to talk about his/her day with the check-in program supervisor and have a
   snack. The youth may sign-out with the check-in program supervisor to participate in other organized
   youth activities such as youth sports, enrichment classes, clubs, scouting, or other activities approved
   by the parent. The youth may stay in the youth facility under the supervision of the check-in program
   supervisor and do homework, read, or participate in youth center open recreation activities. The youth
   may leave the facility only with the written daily permission of the parents and check-in supervisor.
   When leaving the facility the youth must carry this written permission with him or her.
   9.1.2. End of Day Departures. Follow the written instructions of the parent for the end-of-day
   departure of the youth. After the last activity of the day, allow the youth to return to the check-in point
   to wait for the parent or go directly home.

9.2. Supervisor’s Role. Staff the program with a person(s) trained to work with youth. The check-in
supervisor must follow established procedures for checking youth in/out, keep an activity schedule for
each youth, interact with participants, and follow parents' written instruction for their children’s participa-
tion in other activities.

9.3. Parents’ Role. The parents must decide how much independence and responsibility each youth is
ready for, and plan the youth's weekly after school activities within the guidelines of the local program.
The parents schedule all outside activities, and arrange transportation if the program is not able to provide
it. The parent is also responsible for letting the check-in supervisor know when the child is going to be
late, and must also agree to come to the program site if the child is ill and needs to be taken home.

9.4. Program Charges. Management must set reasonable fees to match the services offered. If the
youth remains under the supervision of the check-in supervisor, one fee may be charged while a different
fee may be charged if the youth participates in other activities.

9.5. Level of Supervision. If check-in children remain under the direct supervision of the check-in staff
(do not leave the facility to participate in other activities), ensure there is one check-in staff member for
every 15 children.




                                                  25

                                       DAY CAMP PROGRAM

10.1. Day Camp Scope. Offer full-day camp programs for children during school holidays and vacation
periods. The full-day program may be held for a few days or in weekly blocks during school vacations.
Adjust the schedule to fit the local school calendars. Select a focus that meets local needs such as an all
age day camp, day camp for 10-12 year old campers, or specialty camps. Consider working parents’
needs for supervision for their children when school is not in session in establishing day camp schedules.
   10.1.1. Thematic Programming. Use creative contemporary themes to hold the interest of the
   campers. Thematic programming in specialty camps is optional. It is desirable to promote positive
   attitudes and behaviors and desirable values related to theme activities. Examples of attitudes and val-
   ues that could be incorporated within themes are recycling, preserving the environment, citizenship,
   physical fitness, teamwork, learning about different people, and helping one another.
   10.1.2. Specialty Camps. In a specialty camp, concentrate on a special skill, such as performing arts,
   specific sports, use of computers, swimming, or reading, but incorporate these activities with some
   standard day camp activities in order to offer a well-rounded program which maintains the youth’s
   interests.

10.2. Program Areas. Use different formats and content areas to offer a variety of activities to meet var-
ious needs of youth. Develop the program structure by using format elements such as classes, clubs, trips,
interest groups, or combined group activities. Introduce participants to a variety of leisure pursuits and
activities which promote the development of lifelong leisure skills. Use special techniques such as ice-
breakers and introductory games to contribute to day camp fun. Include in the schedule combined group
activities; active low-organized games; special events; and scheduled free time.
   10.2.1. Content Areas. Design the program as a combination of activity-oriented activities. Include
   participation in dramatics, art, music, crafts, aquatics, land sports, and other activities that depend
   strongly on the utilization of natural resources, such as hiking, gardening, appreciation of nature,
   importance of preservation practices, and sound conservation, etc. Design activities to satisfy the
   campers' interests and abilities.
   10.2.2. Extended Hours Care. If extended service needs to be offered before or after the full-day
   camp program, this time should be the most relaxed part of a child's day in the program. Provide
   materials for children to follow their own interests at their own pace. Provide time for children to talk
   with friends and staff or relax.

10.3. Producing Program Memories. In addition to producing day-to-day technically and developmen-
tally sound activities, include surprise events to exceed campers' expectations. Structure activities and
events to create a mood, an illusion, and a sense of expectation.

10.4. Bad Weather Days. The staff should develop a "rainy day" package of activities and make it avail-
able to each day camp counselor to use in case of inclement weather which prevents the children from
being outdoors or when some other unique circumstances, such as repairs on the outdoor fields, make it
undesirable or impossible for the regular schedule to be followed.



                                                26
10.5. Day Camp Programs for Older Youth (10-12 years). Offer programs with special appeal for
older children, based on local demand for school age programs for this age group. Include activities such
as creative expression, sports, outdoor recreation, leadership development, peer helping, practical skills,
personal improvement, job exposure/experience, and community service. Use contemporary materials
relating to what youth are thinking about and are interested in. Encourage youth ownership/empower-
ment and leadership of youth in activities and special events. Develop programs to provide the following
benefits to youth:
   10.5.1. Social growth--Make new friends, learn group skills, gain social support.
   10.5.2. Personal development--Improve self-concept, sense of achievement, self-reliance.
   10.5.3. Physical development--Enhance sense of wellness.
   10.5.4. Learning and growth--Exploration and exposure to new facts and ideas.
   10.5.5. Self-expression--Progression toward personal potential.

11.1. Safety. Guidance for safety in school age programs is given in AFI 34-249. Examine safety condi-
tions on a daily basis to assure local policies, practices, equipment, or materials are not being followed or
used which could contribute to potentially unsafe situations for children. Provide safety awareness infor-
mation to staff and volunteers to increase their ability to provide a safe environment for children.

11.2. Structural Fire Certification. AFI 34-249 gives guidance on compliance with the structural
requirements of the National Fire Protection Act 101 Life Safety Code 1991 or the latest edition and the
requirements for Air Force Fire Safety Facility certification.

11.3. Comprehensive Fire Inspection. An annual, unannounced, comprehensive operational fire
inspection must be conducted by the base fire department using the AF Operational Fire Safety Checklist
developed by HQ AFCESA/CESM.

11.4. Fire Evacuation Plan. Follow guidance in AFI 34-249 for fire drills. The youth director should
develop procedures for conducting fire drills safely and within a reasonable time period. The school age
program coordinator or his or her designee must conduct two drills during the first week of the new school
year and monthly thereafter. If outside conditions would endanger the safety or health of the children,
conduct a mock drill with the children going to the exit doors after the bells sound. A fire inspection must
be conducted twice during the first week of the fall school year and monthly thereafter. A copy of the last
fire inspection report is posted in the facility and the records are maintained for 1 year.

11.5. Protection From Unsafe Materials and Objects. Avoid exposure of children to unsafe materials
and equipment. Closely monitor the use of dangerous items such as tools or electrical items. Protective
caps are required for electrical outlets in rooms used by children under age 6.
   11.5.1. Lead-Based Paint. Have no flaking or deteriorating or lead-based paint in areas used by
   youth. If flaking or deteriorating paint is found, it must be tested for lead content. If the lead content
   is above acceptable levels, abatement or in-place correction must be accomplished; otherwise, the
   children should be restricted from accessing the involved area.
   11.5.2. Chemicals. Public Health (PH) must approve the use of all cleaning products in writing. This
   includes products used by contract custodians. The facility should submit a list of products for which
   approval is required. Chemicals, cleaning solutions, and other potentially dangerous products should
   be stored in their original, labeled containers in cabinets or closets which are inaccessible to children.
   11.5.3. Poisonous Plants. All plants in the facility environment must be approved by PH or be on a
   list of recommended plants for use in children’s settings. Give children instructions about poisonous
   plants before field trips in natural environment settings.
   11.5.4. Electrical Appliances. Use only electrical appliances which meet the Underwriters Labora-
   tory guidelines or host nation requirements, whichever provide greater safety. Kitchen equipment
   should be inspected by PH to ensure compliance with National Sanitation Foundation requirements.
   This inspection should be accomplished at the time of installation and every 3 years thereafter.



                                                 28
11.6. Administering Medication. Guidance for administering medication and documentation is pro-
vided in AFI 34-249. If medication is administered, ensure persons responsible for administering pre-
scription medications are trained annually by medical staff. Record the training in the individuals’
training files. Administer medications only under daily written direction of parents and when possible,
have the same person(s) administer medications. Do not use over-the-counter medications, including
aspirin, aspirin-like products, antihistamines, and/or cough syrup, unless a physician has prescribed it for
a particular child. If parents prefer that their child administer his or her own medications, obtain written
instructions from them to that effect. Store these medications with those that will be administered by the
staff. Have the program medical advisor approve one or more sun screens for use in the program. Obtain
annual parental approval for use of the sun screen on their child. Use other means of protecting children
from over-exposure to the sun including providing shade where activities are conducted outdoors and lim-
iting the amount of time children are outdoors in hot sun. Encourage children to become aware of the
importance of protecting themselves from over-exposure to the sun and teach them how to dress and pro-
tect themselves from sun damage.

11.7. Accidents. Safety of the children is a primary operational concern. Check program conditions
against factors causing accidents shown in Table 11.1. Make indoor and outdoor activities as safe as pos-
sible.

Table 11.1. Factors Contributing to Accidents.
FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO ACCIDENTS INVOLVING CHILDREN

A child is in the care of persons not familiar with the routines and activities of children.
A child is hungry, tired, angry, or confused.
Hazards are present such as sharp knives, bottles of medicine, slippery floors/sidewalks, busy streets.
Staff members are tired, not feeling well; or they bring personal problems to work.
Routines are not consistently established so children do not know what is expected of them and what
they can expect.
A parent is ill, despondent, or troubled over family or marital problems.
The relationship between parents is continually tense.
   11.7.1. Active Games and Safety. The school-age program assistant must be prepared to teach
   games so they can safely be enjoyed by participants. The game or activity must be age appropriate.
   Children must know the rules and goals of the game or activity. Participants must have a chance to
   practice the separate skills of the game or activity before "serious" play begins.
   11.7.2. Outdoor Play and Safety. A safety specialist must conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
   the outdoor play areas as a part of the annual unannounced comprehensive safety inspection of child
   care facilities. Guidelines for outdoor play and safety, and indoor safety and play, are provided in
   Attachment 11 and Attachment 12, respectively.
   11.7.3. Playground Safety. Center staff, trained and task-certified by safety personnel, must monitor
   outdoor areas and equipment daily. Remove sharp edges and protruding objects on playgrounds.
   Replace any missing parts of playground equipment. Also remove glass, trash, and animal debris.
   Ensure playground equipment and installation complies with the United States Consumer Product


                                                29
Safety Commission Handbook for Public Playground Safety 1991 edition or the latest edition. Ensure
fall zones around playground equipment have impact altering materials of sufficient depth and are of
sufficient size to comply with the handbook. Ensure playground equipment does not form openings
that could trap a child’s head or body. Ensure openings in playground equipment are less than 3.5
inches or more than 9 inches. Playground equipment should be tested for entrapment hazards using
forms designed for this purpose. Prohibit children from wearing clothing with drawstrings while they
are on the playground equipment; such clothing can lead to hanging and strangulation when worn on
playground equipment.

                        HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND FOOD OPERATION

12.1. Health. Guidance on protecting children’s health while they are in school-age programs is pro-
vided in AFI 34-249. Follow good health and hygiene practices. The staff should observe and model
good health practices by conforming to health rules and by being knowledgeable about signs and symp-
toms of illness. Children should be taught healthy habits. Smoking should not be permitted inside the
facility or in outdoor areas which are used by the children.

12.2. Personal Hygiene Habits. Staff will have children wash hands before eating, after toileting, after
touching animals, after blowing or wiping their nose, before water play, and after returning from outside.
Do not permit children to share eating or drinking utensils, personal grooming items, hats, or personal
food during snacks or meals. Include brushing teeth as a part of the program when meals are eaten. Store
toothbrushes separately and ensure they are only used by the children to whom they belong.

12.3. Signs and Symptoms of Illness. Follow guidance on protecting children from disease in AFI
34-249. Ensure all children are screened at the time of entry for signs of illness including communicable
diseases. Do not admit children who are ill. School-age program assistants must know how to recognize
signs and symptoms of illness. When a child becomes ill, ensure the child's immediate medical needs are
taken care of. Notify the parent immediately to discuss the child's condition. Do not permit children to
remain in the program when their illness will endanger the health of other children or they do not feel well
enough to participate in the program activities.
   12.3.1. Emergency Symptoms. Follow guidance on emergency medical care in AFI 34-249. Some
   conditions require immediate professional medical attention. If any of the following symptoms are
   observed, follow local OI guidance for requesting emergency assistance:
       12.3.1.1. Convulsions.
       12.3.1.2. Unconsciousness.
       12.3.1.3. Marked difficulty in breathing.
       12.3.1.4. Ingestion of any potentially toxic substance.
   12.3.2. Less Serious Symptoms. If a child appears ill, call the parent to discuss the child’s symp-
   toms. Situations for which a parents must be contacted to pick up the child are:
       12.3.2.1. Temperature over 101 degrees F (oral).
       12.3.2.2. Earache.
       12.3.2.3. Vomiting.
       12.3.2.4. Diarrhea.
       12.3.2.5. Severe abdominal pain.
       12.3.2.6. Serious physical injury (head injury, injured limb, etc.).

12.4. Communicable Diseases. Follow guidance on protecting children from communicable diseases in
AFI 34-249. If children are exposed to a communicable disease, the parents must be notified. A letter

                                                31
coordinated with PH must be given to parents and posted at the program site. Common communicable
diseases are shown in Attachment 13.

12.5. Chronic Health Problems. School-age program assistants must be alert to children who have
chronic (long term) health problems such as diabetes, epilepsy, allergies, and asthma. Detailed informa-
tion about specific health issues should be obtained from the parents at the time of enrollment. A list of
children’s allergies and medical problems should be maintained in their home room in a convenient loca-
tion where the staff can see them, yet the confidentiality of the children is protected. The program medi-
cal advisor should approve the enrollment of all children with chronic medical problems.

12.6. Accidents. In case of an accident requiring professional medical assistance, follow guidance in AFI
34-249. Be calm with the child, regardless of how serious the injury may be. Follow accepted first-aid
practices of the American Red Cross or from another recognized first-aid training program. For example,
in the case of minor accidents, wash the wounds with soap and water and then protect them with sterile
bandages. In all injuries involving blood, latex gloves must be worn by the person administering first-aid
and Center for Disease Control procedures must be followed. Place used gloves in a plastic bag before
discarding them.

12.7. Cleanliness and Sanitation. AFI 34-249 provides guidance on authorized custodial services for
school-age programs. Staff should also help keep rooms and furnishings used by children clean during
the program day. Sanitize table and chairs used for food service each day. Make a sanitizing solution by
mixing 1/4 teaspoon of bleach with one quart of water or one teaspoon bleach with one gallon of water.
The custodial staff should keep hard surface floors swept and sanitize them daily and after use for lunch
service. Vacuum all carpets in the program area each day. Involve the children in keeping the areas orga-
nized and free of debris.

12.8. Heating and Ventilation. AFI 34-249 gives guidance on acceptable standards for heating and ven-
tilation. Only use rooms that may be ventilated by windows that can be opened, have air conditioning, or
a ventilation system.

12.9. Nutrition and Food Service. Follow guidance on food service in AFI 34-249. Serve meals and
snacks in a sanitary, pleasant way to meet children's nutritional needs and promote good eating habits.
Allow time for socializing in conjunction with meals.
   12.9.1. Nutritional Requirements. Provide meals and/or snacks to meet children's nutritional
   requirements in proportion to the amount of time the children are in the program each day. The
   amount and type of food served each age group must meet U.S. Department of Agriculture's Child/
   Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) requirements. Use cycle menus approved by a dietitian or MAJ-
   COM specialist. Record food substitutions on the menu posted for parents prior to serving. Date
   menus and keep them on file for at least 1 year or as required by USDA. Sample breakfast menus,
   lunch menus, and snacks are at Attachment 14.
   12.9.2. Food Preparation and Service. AFI 34-249 and AFI 48-116, Food Safety Program, contain
   policy guidance for preparing and serving food and AFMAN 34-228, Air Force Club Program Proce-
   dures, provides procedures on food cost controls. Serve only food prepared at or for the center by an
   organization approved to provide food service. This includes foods used for special celebrations. Fol-
   low Air Force and USDA CACFP food preparation requirements. Prepare, handle, and serve food in

                                               32
ways to ensure sanitation and disease control. If food is prepared at another facility, transport it to the
program in appropriate, sanitary containers and at appropriate temperatures. Adults must wash their
hands immediately before serving food or assisting with meals/snacks. See additional guidelines in
Attachment 15. Encourage children to assist with setting up and serving the meals and with clean-up
after meals.
12.9.3. Water. Provide children with water or other liquids throughout the program day. Serve water
in single service cups or by fountain.
   12.9.3.1. Water Testing. Ensure water is tested by Bioenvironmental Engineering every 3 years
   for chemical contaminants and annually for bacterial contaminants. Maintain test results in the
   program office.

                                   CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT

13.1. Child Abuse or Neglect. AFI 34-249 gives guidance on preventing and reporting child abuse and
neglect. Protect children from abuse and neglect while they are in the program. The staff must recognize
indicators of abuse or neglect and follow the reporting policy mandated by AFMAN 34-704, Prevention
of Child Abuse.

13.2. Supervision of Children. Staff must supervise children at all times. Each child must be under the
care of a specific adult and the adult must know where the child is at all times. Use AF Form 1930, Youth
Flight Daily Attendance Record, to assign children to adults and update the form throughout the hours
of the program. Contact parents when children do not arrive at the program when expected or depart
before permitted.

13.3. Facilities and Equipment. Design and use buildings to permit visual monitoring of interactions
between children and children and adults. Use closed circuit television to enhance supervision of areas
not visible from the administrative offices of the youth center. Use convex mirrors or other means of pro-
viding visual access as necessary. Provide viewing access into each room used through a window in the
doors or walls. If it is not possible to view into any area or room, keep doors to those areas or rooms
propped open or locked during hours of operation. Leave the lights on in all rooms, including closets with
windows, toilets, offices, and storage areas when the building is in use. Do not place anything over win-
dows in doors or interior walls to prevent viewing into rooms, or in closets in activity rooms, or hallways.

13.4. Preventing Unauthorized Access. Minimize unsupervised and unapproved access to children
enrolled in the school age program. Require all visitors, to any facility used for school-age programs, to
sign in and out and be accompanied while they are in the program area. AF Form 1109, Visitor Record
Log, may be used to record visitors to the program. Other than parents of enrolled children, permit only
those persons who are on official business to be in the program facilities. Have the staff monitor the main
entrance when in an indoor facility. Limit the number of entrances used to those that can be monitored.
Have alarms on any exits that cannot be monitored visually or by closed circuit television. In a mixed use
facility, keep adults in the facility for other reasons away from the children except when properly accom-
panied by program personnel.

13.5. Release of Children. Release children only to persons authorized in writing by the parents or
guardians. Permit children over age 5 to leave unaccompanied only with written parental permission.
Staff members must not release children to siblings or other children under age 14. Do not permit chil-
dren 5 and under to leave the program unaccompanied.

13.6. Child Guidance Training. Train staff who work with children on appropriate guidance and disci-
pline techniques, including training on acceptable and unacceptable ways of touching, talking to, and han-
dling children.

13.7. Reporting Violations. Report, in writing and telephonically, all violations of the child guidance
policy to the family member support flight chief or his or her supervisor. Report, by telephone and in
writing, all suspected child abuse and neglect to the family advocacy office (FAO).

                                                34
13.8. Investigation of Child Abuse and Neglect. Investigation of suspected child abuse or neglect is
conducted by the FAO, local child protection services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Office of
Special Investigations (OSI) when indicated. All information pertaining to a case of alleged abuse or
neglect should be confidential and, as such, should be shared only on a “need to know” basis. Individuals
who are under investigation for suspected child abuse or neglect should not be permitted to work in any
program or facility serving children during the period of investigation, or after an allegation is substanti-
ated.

13.9. Child Abuse Training. AFI 34-249 gives guidance on required initial and annual training on
reporting suspected child abuse and neglect. Provide staff written information on child abuse identifica-
tion, reporting, and prevention at the time of employment and annually.

13.10. Child Abuse and Safety Hot Line. The number of the base FAO and DoD Child Abuse and
Safety Hot Line should be posted prominently in the lobby of all facilities used for school-age care and in
the program offices. The number should also be included in all parent handbooks and brochures.

                                      PARENT INVOLVEMENT

14.1. Parent Involvement. Ensure parents are welcome in the program at all times. Provide parents
both opportunities to be actively involved in the program and to talk with staff about the program and the
child’s involvement in the program. Have parents from the school-age program represented on the Youth
Flight or Child Development Programs Advisory Committee. Supervisors should ensure that staff mem-
bers solicit the active involvement of both mothers and fathers at all levels of the program.

14.2. Communicating With Parents. Ensure staff and volunteers communicate positively with parents.
Treat parents as partners in the program and provide them with information about the program. Inform
parents in advance about policy or regulatory changes and other issues concerning the program and their
children. Notify them of the date, time, and destination of field trips that require the use of a vehicle or
walking from normal program locations. Encourage parents to attend or be part of special events. Ask
parents about special skills or interests they have that can be used in the program.

14.3. Parent Handbook. A parent program handbook may be developed locally to meet the specific
needs of each site. A parent handbook is one of the major avenues of communication with parents on a
number of key issues and allows consistency in the information given to parents. Suggested parent hand-
book topics are provided at Attachment 16.

                                 OUTDOOR PLAY AND SAFETY

A11.1. Guidelines.
   A11.1.1. Know the number of children present at all times and be aware of where the children are and
   what they are doing.
   A11.1.2. Set up a system so when children must leave the group, they return safely within a reason-
   able amount of time. You may want to institute a "buddy system" especially with younger children
   whereby a child must always take another child along to the rest room or other area not visually super-
   vised.
   A11.1.3. Staff needing to take care of personal business must make sure children are adequately
   supervised by other staff members to maintain ratios before leaving the group.
   A11.1.4. On the playground, staff must be stationed at different places so all children can be seen at
   all times. Avoid grouping of adults.
