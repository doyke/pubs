SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Updates references and
office symbols.
1. Who can request Deployable Communications Resources? Deployable communications
resources are primarily wartime assets. However, MAJCOMs, wings, and units may request
temporary use of these resources during peacetime. An example request would be for an exercise
or training to meet wartime mission set.
     1.1. Each MAJCOM will designate a focal point for processing requirements. Send a copy
     of this designation and subsequent changes to the following applicable electronic message
     account:
        1.1.1. HQ USAF PENTAGON//A3CX/A6CX// ( safxcicocr@pentagon.af.mil )
2. Restrictions. The following restrictions apply to peacetime employment of deployable
communications resources and require A3CX/A6CX waiver approval:
     2.1. Temporary deployment of resources for more than 179 calendar days.
        2.1.1. Request waivers at least 45 calendar days before deployments are scheduled to
        end.

689CCW ROBINS AFB GA//XP// ( 689ccw.workflow@robins.af.mil )
     2.2. Do not utilize deployable communications resources to support fixed requirements if the
     deployment would prevent the Air Force from supporting war, crisis, or contingency
     operations.
     2.3. Deployable communications resources will maintain Unit Type Code (UTC) mission
     capability and be able to redeploy according to the owning unitâ€™s designed operational
     capability (DOC) statement response time.
     2.4. The deployed UTC must include a readiness spares package (RSP), necessary test
     equipment, special tools, technical manuals, and administrative support kits.
        2.4.1. Tasked units should manage RSP and associated support equipment according to
        AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual.

      2.4.2. The requiring wing, unit, or agency must replace parts removed from the RSP
      during the deployment or provide funding to allow replacement by depot if required.
   2.5. Requesting deployable communications resources to provide service when fixed
   facilities are being upgraded or replaced must meet the following guidelines:
      2.5.1. Except in emergencies, deployable communications resources will not deploy until
      a firm installation or repair start date has been established.
      2.5.2. Wings, units, or agencies needing deployable communications support must
      submit requests at least 120 calendar days in advance of the proposed installation date
      when possible.
      2.5.3. Do not utilize deployable communications resources to support an engineering and
      installation (EI) project until a pre-installation survey is completed and all required assets
      to begin the EI activity are on hand.
      2.5.4. Wings or units should allow at least an additional 30 calendar days between
      completing a pre-installation survey and the date when they need deployable
      communications resources to support an installation project.
   2.6. Without approved funding for travel allowances, limit road haul distances for
   deployable communications resources to no more than one day (approximately 300 miles
   under ideal road conditions) from the supporting unit location (see paragraph 5.4. for further
   information.)
   2.7. Send waiver requests to the following applicable electronic message account:
      2.7.1. HQ USAF PENTAGON//A3CX/A6CX// ( safxcicocr@pentagon.af.mil )
