Section A—Guidance on Telephone Services

1. Applicability and Scope. Offices often order their own local telephone service for off-base sites with-
out host base communications support. Locations obtaining communications services from the host base
communications unit will comply with host base directives. Procedures in AFI 33-111, Telephone Systems
Management, for obtaining and managing leased telephone and telephone-related services apply. Proce-
dures in AFI 33-101, Communications and Information Management Guidance and Responsibilities, for
identifying new communication requirements apply.

2. Supplements. AFROTC and AFRS may supplement this instruction to provide further communica-
tions-computer systems guidelines. Coordinate supplements with AETC CSS/SCYC prior to publication.
This also applies to AFROTC and AFRS subordinate units.

3. Communication Services. Telephone service for a government office requires a signed contract
(agreement) between a government contracting officer and the telephone company representative. Public
Law requires anything that obligates government tax dollars to be accountable in writing. In this case,
accountability is in the form of a contract and all transactions (work orders, telephone bills, payments,
etc.) with the telephone company. See paragraph 4. for a list of commonly used forms or information man-
agement tools (IMT) for communications services. Forms and IMTs can be accessed through the online
Air Force e-Publishing Web site at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil.

4. Tools Used for Communications Services:
    4.1. DISA Direct Order Entry (DDOE). This electronically produced form is used to request vari-
    ous types of communication services to include long distance telephone service through Federal Tele-
    communications System 2001 (FTS2001). To gain access to DDOE, users must register at the DISA
    DITCO home page (http://www.scott.disa.mil) to request a user identification (USERID) and pass-
    word.
    4.2. DD Form 428, Communication Service Authorization. This form is a contract for regulated
    telephone services. The state public utility commission (PUC) regulates (controls and approves) the
    cost and type of this local telephone service. The communication service authorization (CSA) allows
    a government office to lease regulated services from the local telephone company. The form contains
    a description of services. It lists the service by a telephone service code (for example, uniform stan-
    dard ordering code [USOC]) and sets a dollar limit for both the monthly recurring and nonrecurring
    charges. Monthly recurring charges usually remain the same each month. Nonrecurring charges are
    one-time charges for services such as installations and relocations. The contracting office at Tinker
    AFB (38 EIG/PKK) is responsible for issuing and making changes to these contracts upon receipt of
    a validated request (AF IMT 1218, Request for Communications Service). NOTE: DD Form 1155,
    Order for Supplies or Services, may be used by the contracting office in place of DD Form 428.
    4.3. AF IMT 1218, Request for Communications Service. This IMT is a request for a new CSA or
    a change to an existing CSA. This includes deleting a CSA and/or adding new requirements to an
    existing service. It may request an increase or decrease to the quantity of an item or to the authorized
    dollar amount on a CSA. A change in address for an office or a billing address to another town or city
    will also require an AF IMT 1218 be submitted. Notify only the telephone company for changes
    involving street addresses in the same town or city. See Attachment 2 for a sample of AF IMT 1218.
AETCI33-101 15 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                               5


   4.4. DD Form 1367, Commercial Communication Work Order. This form (or equivalent) is a
   telephone work order. It is a request to the telephone company for ordering and changing services. It
   references the CSA that authorizes the applicable services. See Attachment 3 for a sample DD Form
   1367.
   4.5. AETC IMT 1392, Summary of Installed Equipment and Services. This IMT is a record of
   all services installed (by office location, quantity, and tariff rate [cost] per item), and a summary total
   of monthly recurring charges. The completed IMT is an inventory of all current services under one
   CSA, which verifies monthly recurring charges on the telephone bill. See Attachment 4 for a sample
   AETC IMT 1392 and instructions for completing it.
   4.6. AETC IMT 1393, Telephone Work Order Log. This IMT is a record of all telephone work
   orders (DD Forms 1367) submitted to the telephone company. This information validates nonrecur-
   ring charges for installations and disconnects against the telephone bill. See Attachment 5 for a sam-
   ple AETC IMT 1393 and instructions for completing it.
   4.7. AF IMT 9, Request For Purchase. This IMT is used to purchase services and equipment
   through the local contracting squadron when the equipment is not available through base supply.
   4.8. AETC IMT 1308, Verification of Long Distance Telephone Calls. This IMT is used to vali-
   date and justify sampled toll calls that exceed specified dollar amounts made after working hours.
   This IMT also identifies unofficial calls. See Attachment 6 for a sample AETC IMT 1308 and
   instructions for completing it.
   4.9. SF 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal. T h i s          form
   allows for payment of the telephone bill through an accounting and finance office. The host account-
   ing and finance office may substitute a memorandum for the SF 1034. In this case, follow base guid-
   ance in processing your payment request. See Attachment 7 for a sample SF 1034 and AFI 33-111 for
   additional preparation instructions.
   4.10. DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher. This form is used for the payment of unofficial
   calls (personal calls) by the responsible caller.

5. Telephone Service Procedures. Organizations must limit services to the amount necessary to accom-
plish the mission as follows:
   5.1. Consider economy and availability of funds before submitting communications requests.
   5.2. When developing communications requirements, consider available telecommunications service,
   such as the Defense Switched Network (DSN) and local and long distance commercial service.
   5.3. Keep records of all communications-related documents up to date. This includes applicable doc-
   uments such as AF IMT 1218, DD Form 428, AETC IMT 1392, AETC IMT 1393, AF IMT 9, and
   forms for ordering FTS2001 services.
   5.4. Allow station-to-station collect calls from applicants and avoid operator-assisted calls and per-
   son-to-person collect calls.

Section B—Long Distance Service

6. General Instructions. Consider the available types of long distance service for cost-effectiveness in
meeting mission requirements. The only long distance service paid for by the government is for official
calls by authorized and approved users.

7. Types of Long Distance Service:
    7.1. DSN. This is a telephone system used by DoD subscribers to call military and other federal gov-
    ernment agencies. DSN is mainly for command and control functions on a government installation.
    7.2. Direct Distance Dialing (DDD). This is a Dial 1 long distance service without the aid of an
    operator. The telephone company that provides this type of long distance service is the primary inter-
    exchange carrier (PIC).
    7.3. FTS2001. This service is administered by the General Services Administration (GSA). Congress
    mandates the use of FTS2001 when DSN is not available or does not meet other long distance require-
    ments. Some of the services provided by FTS2001 are basic outbound long distance service, audio
    conferencing, calling cards (continental United States [CONUS] or International), 800-dial service,
    900-dial service, video teleconferencing capability, and circuit-switched data service (CSDS).

Section C—AFRS Responsibilities

8. Units. AFRS units located on military installations will attempt to obtain commercial communications
services from their host base before submitting DDOE request. Off-base recruiting offices located in fed-
eral buildings serviced by GSA’s consolidated system will use GSA-provided local service. AFRS units
located within a Defense Metropolitan Area Telephone System (DMATS) region will obtain telephone
services, including access to commercial service, from the DMATS manager unless specifically
exempted. Other AFRS units not located on military installations will obtain commercial communications
through DDOE request.

9. Squadron Commanders. Each recruiting squadron commander is responsible for ensuring that all
activities within the squadron comply with this instruction and AFI 33-111.

10. Telephone Control Officers (TCO) and Alternate TCOs. Each squadron support flight com-
mander and logistics noncommissioned officer will serve as the TCO and alternate TCO, respectively.
They must ensure compliance with the following telephone guidelines:
    10.1. Verify installed commercial communication equipment and services authorized by this instruc-
    tion are accurately listed on the telephone bill.
    10.2. Read the CSA to understand the authorizations in the description of services and the contract
    requirements under special provisions.
    10.3. Verify installed commercial communication equipment and services do not exceed the limits of
    the applicable CSA (DD Form 428) and/or AF IMT 9.
    10.4. Monitor CSAs to ensure maximum limit quantities are adequate and meet future anticipated
    requirements.
AETCI33-101 15 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                              7


   10.5. Maintain a complete file of CSAs, AF IMTs 1218, and AF IMTs 9 for leased commercial com-
   munications at the squadron headquarters.
   10.6. Verify communication waivers are approved before requesting communications that exceed
   those authorized by this instruction.
   10.7. Maintain a copy of the annual waiver review with copies of approved waivers.
   10.8. Ensure calling cardholders comply with AFI 33-111 and keep cardholders’ signed statements on
   file.
   10.9. Date stamp telephone bills upon receipt from the telephone company and process them
   promptly for payment according to AFI 33-111.
   10.10. Analyze telephone bills and call detail records (CDR) to identify trends in usage and question-
   able calls.
   10.11. Ensure long distance calls are validated and certified by the TCO prior to payment. Long dis-
   tance calls originating from squadron headquarters and military entrance processing stations (MEPS)
   located on a military installations do not require written justification unless required by host base pub-
   lications.
   10.12. Furnish a list of individuals making unofficial telephone calls to accounting and finance for
   collection. Include caller’s name, social security number, unit of assignment, date of call, city and
   number called, amount owed, and telephone billing data.

11. Assistant TCO. The assistant TCO will:
   11.1. Ensure telephone bills received are for offices under their jurisdiction.
   11.2. Ensure the toll portion of the telephone bill is validated.
   11.3. Identify unofficial calls to the squadron TCO.
   11.4. Reconcile questionable charges with the telephone company.
   11.5. Forward telephone service requests, billing discrepancies, and unresolved trouble calls to the
   squadron TCO.
   11.6. Turn in government-owned communications equipment to the logistics section when no longer
   needed.

12. Calling Card Holders. Record calling card calls on an AF IMT 1072, Authorized Long Distance
Telephone Calls, or equivalent. Submit this IMT monthly to the TCO. The procedures for using calling
cards (credit cards) are described in AFI 33-111. When AF IMT 1072 is not used, the following condi-
tions must be met:
   12.1. The calling card bill must reflect the same information required on AF IMT 1072; for example,
   date call was made, duration of call, phone number called, city and state called.
   12.2. The cardholder must annotate on the calling card bill why the calls were made and sign the bill
   certifying all calls are for official business.
   12.3. The TCO or equivalent verifies that all calls made were official and valid, then certifies the call-
   ing card bill by signing the bill.

NOTE: If the conditions in paragraphs 12.1. through 12.3. cannot be met, AF IMT 1072 must be accom-
plished. Calling card users should annotate calls made so it would be easier to reference when it is time to
validate the bill.

Section D—AFRS Guidelines and Procedures

13. Requesting Local Telephone Service. The first step in obtaining local services is to have a contract
in place and understand this contract. The contract for local regulated service is a CSA (DD Form 428),
which will authorize a list of specific services and the allowable dollar amount (maximum limit). The
established quantities of items and the monetary amounts set the limit for authorized services. If a new
CSA is needed, use AF IMT 1218 to request this local service. AF IMT 1218 may also be used to request
an increase or change to the limits in the CSA.

14. Establishing or Changing a CSA. The requesting organization will submit an original AF IMT
1218 to HQ AFRS/RSITNN for coordination. HQ AFRS/RSITNN will forward the IMT to AETC CSS/
SCYC for approval or disapproval. AETC CSS/SCYC will forward the approved AF IMT 1218 to the
contracting office. The contracting office will initiate or modify the CSA. The contracting office will send
a new CSA or modification of an existing CSA to the squadron.

15. Ordering Services Through the Local Telephone Company. Submit DD Form 1367 or a locally
devised memorandum to order services and equipment from the local telephone company. Annotate the
required action on an AETC IMT 1393 and file the DD Form 1367 or locally devised memorandum.

16. Maintaining Inventory. Use AETC IMT 1392 or an equivalent computer product to record all ser-
vices for each CSA. Enter each office location, service installed, quantity, current unit tariff rate, and a
sum total of monthly recurring charges. When the tariff rate changes, submit AF IMT 1218 to ensure
changes to CSA rates and annotate these changes on this inventory. Destroy AETC IMT 1392 6 months
after service is discontinued.

17. Recording Telephone Work Orders. Use AETC IMT 1393 or an equivalent computer product to
record each DD Form 1367 (or locally devised memorandum) submitted to the telephone company. Vali-
date all installation and disconnection charges with these records to ensure payment is due. Destroy
AETC IMT 1393 6 months after service is discontinued.

18. Requesting Long Distance Service:
    18.1. CONUS Long Distance Service. The requester will go to the DISA Direct web page and sub-
    mit a DDOE FTS2001 service request for long distance service.
    18.2. Calling Cards for CONUS Calls. Off-base recruiting personnel will go to the DISA Direct
    Web page and submit a DDOE FTS2001 service request for callings cards. Onbase recruiting loca-
    tions will obtain calling cards from their host base communications-computer systems office. Onbase
    recruiting personnel will prepare and submit a requirements document to the host base communica-
    tions unit for approval. Squadrons obtaining calling cards from the host base communications-com-
    puter systems officer must comply with host base directives.
AETCI33-101 15 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                           9


Section E—Telecommunication Equipment for AFRS

criteria are met:
   21.1. The itinerary office is manned a minimum of 16 hours each week.
   21.2. Security is provided for all installed equipment. At a minimum, a locked office door is consid-
   ered adequate security.
   21.3. Funds are available for both recurring and nonrecurring costs.

22. Waiver Requests:
   22.1. When the authorizations in this instruction are not adequate to meet mission requirements, the
   squadron TCO may request a waiver through HQ AFRS/RSITNN for validation or approval. Special
   features and items not specifically authorized by this instruction require AETC CSS/SCYC approval.
   As a minimum, waiver requests must include:
       22.1.1. A detailed justification to include why authorizations in this instruction are not adequate
       to meet requirements. Provide copies of floor plans when the waiver concerns space layout.
       22.1.2. Length of time for waiver.
       22.1.3. Recurring and nonrecurring charges and any anticipated offsetting savings.
       22.1.4. An availability or certification of funds statement.
   22.2. When approved waivers are no longer required, destroy them 6 months after service is discon-
   tinued. Maintain approved waivers in the active waiver review file.

23. Annual Communications Waiver Review. Review approved waivers each April to determine
necessity and cost-effectiveness with regard to mission accomplishment and funds availability. Each
10                                                                AETCI33-101 15 SEPTEMBER 2004


squadron TCO or alternate TCO with communications waivers will report the status of the squadron’s
waivers to HQ AFRS/RSITNN by 1 May. This report has two parts:
     23.1. Part one contains current waivers by office designation, address, date approved, and type of ser-
     vices and/or equipment approved by waiver. Ensure all communications, including long distance ser-
     vices at the itinerary stops, are in the review.
     23.2. Part two contains waivers that are no longer needed, office designation, address, date approved,
     and date services were terminated or the reason why the waiver is no longer required.

Section F—Telephone Billing Procedures for AFRS

24. Third Party Calls. These calls are placed through the commercial telephone operator and billed to
recruiting office telephone numbers. This includes person-to-person collect calls. Official calls made from
a recruiter’s residence will be direct dialed to reduce cost. This type of official call may be claimed for
reimbursement.

25. Bill Verification, Payment, and Filing. Follow the guidelines in AFI 33-111 for bill verification,
payment, and filing procedures.
     25.1. Commercial Telephone Bills. The telephone company will mail bills directly to the squadron
     TCO’s office for recruiting offices under his or her jurisdiction. The TCO may change the billing
     address and consolidate commercial telephone bills to eliminate late payment charges. On receipt of a
     bill, the TCO or assistant TCO will:
        25.1.1. Date stamp the bill and all copies that reflect the total amount due on receipt.
        25.1.2. Verify monthly recurring charges against AETC IMT 1392.
        25.1.3. Verify nonrecurring charges against AETC IMT 1393.
        25.1.4. Compare recurring and nonrecurring charges with those authorized on the corresponding
        authorization document (DD Form 428).
        25.1.5. Verify fractional charges and credits on monthly rates for service started or discontinued.
        25.1.6. Use either judgmental sampling or 100 percent verification for toll calls. For judgmental
        sampling, randomly select a minimum of 10 percent of the calls. If all these calls are verified as
        official, the toll call portion of the bill may be certified for payment. Further verification is
        required if an unofficial call or calls are found on the bill.
        25.1.7. Use AETC IMT 1308 to validate and justify sampled toll calls that exceed $4 or are made
        during the local hours of 2200 to 0500. Ensure calls from recruiting offices to locations outside the
        squadron boundaries are kept to a minimum.
        25.1.8. Use AETC IMT 1308 to identify unofficial calls.
        25.1.9. Provide a list of individuals responsible for unofficial calls to accounting and finance.
        25.1.10. File AETC IMT 1308 with the toll portion of the commercial bill and retain this portion
        for 1 year.
        25.1.11. Attempt to reconcile any questionable charges with the telephone company prior to pay-
        ment.
AETCI33-101 15 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                           11


       25.1.12. Ensure a voucher, SF 1034 (Attachment 7), is prepared and submitted for payment by
       the financial services office (FSO) not later than 6 workdays before the due date. The host base
       may request a memorandum in place of SF 1034. NOTE: The use of a government purchase card
       (GPC) for payment is not authorized unless specifically spelled out in the CSA (DD Form 428).
       25.1.13. On receipt of an SF 1034 from accounting and finance, ensure a copy is sent to the con-
       tracting office that issued the contract.
       25.1.14. File a copy of the bill and supporting documents, excluding toll portion, with the SF
       1034 for 2 years.
   25.2. FTS2001. On receipt of a CDR, the TCO or assistant TCO will:
       25.2.1. Verify the long distance calls, using either judgmental sampling or 100 percent verifica-
       tion for toll charges.
       25.2.2. Verify charges in the Cost and Obligation Report including CDR charges for the previous
       month.
       25.2.3. Validate and justify sampled toll calls that exceed $4 or are made during the local hours of
       2200 to 0500. Ensure calls from recruiting offices to location outside the squadron boundaries are
       kept to a minimum.
       25.2.4. Identify unofficial calls.
       25.2.5. Provide accounting and finance a list of individuals responsible for unofficial calls.
       25.2.6. Within 7 days of receipt of the Cost and Obligation Report, notify AETC CSS/SCYC
       (through HQ AFRS/RSITNN) of any billing discrepancies equal or greater than $1,000 for possi-
       ble bill adjustment.
       25.2.7. Follow host accounting and finance procedures for bill payment and procedures.

Section G—AFROTC Guidelines

26. Detachment Commander Responsibilities:
   26.1. Ensure the host institution provides communications services to the Department of Aerospace
   Studies on the same basis they are provided to other departments within the institution.
   26.2. Obtain adequate, cost-effective telephone service.
   26.3. Appoint a TCO at each unit receiving telephone funds from AFROTC.
   26.4. Document the TCO appointment in the unit additional duty roster.

27. TCO Responsibilities:
   27.1. Verify all telephone bills prior to payment.
   27.2. Verify long distance toll charges with AF IMT 1072 or a host-institution equivalent.
   27.3. Ensure only authorized, official calls made by unit personnel are paid for with AFROTC funds.

28. Requesting University Telephone Service. Arrange for new or changed telephone services with the
school telecommunications office and/or comptroller (the normal agency for telephone matters). When
12                                                               AETCI33-101 15 SEPTEMBER 2004


Air Force funding is required, use a requirements document to request and justify the change with a
funded AF IMT 9. Submit both IMTs to AFOATS/SC for processing and coordination with AFOATS/FM.
Only designated personnel at AFOATS may approve services that obligate Air Force funds.

29. Requesting Long Distance Service. If the university cannot meet long distance requirements and
AFOATS funds are available, the following services may be an option:
     29.1. CONUS Long Distance Service. The requester will submit a request to the region headquar-
     ters for processing and coordination with HQ AFROTC/CC. HQ AFROTC will submit an FTS2001
     service request through DDOE.
     29.2. Calling Cards for CONUS Calls. Off-base AFROTC personnel will submit a request to the
     region headquarters for processing and coordination with HQ AFROTC/CC. HQ AFROTC will sub-
     mit an FTS2001 service request through DDOE. Onbase AFROTC locations will obtain calling cards
     from their host base communications unit. Request for calling cards must be sent to the region head-
     quarters for coordination. The region headquarters will in-turn validate the request and then submit
     the request to the host base communications unit. The communications squadron will submit an
     approved requirement through DDOE. Squadrons obtaining calling cards from the host communica-
     tions unit must comply with host base policies.
     29.3. Calling Card for International Long Distance Service. The requester will submit a request
     to the region headquarters who will in-turn validate the request for onbase locations to the host base
     communications unit for approval. The communications unit will submit a DDOE for processing. For
     off-base locations, HQ AFROTC will submit a DDOE for approval and processing.

30. Telecommunications Service Authorizations:
     30.1. The host institution and availability of AFROTC funding will determine detachment authoriza-
     tions for equipment and services as follows:
        30.1.1. One telephone per assigned military position.
        30.1.2. One telephone for a secretarial position with a maximum of two commercial telephone
        lines and one telephone for a uniform custodian.
        30.1.3. Touch-tone service.
        30.1.4. A speaker phone for the unit commander.
        30.1.5. A telephone answering machine, if a requirement exists.
     30.2. Discretionary changes that may increase the overall cost must be approved in writing by
     AFOATS/SC prior to making the changes.

31. Unofficial Calls:
     31.1. Usage. Unofficial calls include personal calls. Unit personnel may use AFROTC-funded tele-
     phones for unofficial calls if all the following apply:
        31.1.1. The call is concerning an emergency situation.
        31.1.2. The call does not adversely affect the performance of official duties.
        31.1.3. The government does not incur long distance toll charges.
AETCI33-101 15 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                             13


   31.2. Reimbursement of Unofficial Calls. Detachment commanders have the authority to allow the
   emergency use of an official phone to place an unofficial toll call. The individual responsible for an
   unofficial call charge will reimburse AFROTC or the host institution, as appropriate. The individual
   will submit a letter of explanation to AFROTC and will include a check for the full amount made out
   to the Defense Accounting Office at Maxwell AFB AL. For AFROTC-funded calls, annotate the call
   on an AF IMT 1072 and follow the guidance in paragraph 34.

32. Toll Free Telephone Service. An “800” toll free telephone number to AFROTC, Maxwell AFB AL,
is available primarily for those detachments, admissions counselors, and AFROTC liaison officers with
only commercial telephone access. There is no requirement to log toll free calls. Each call is billed sepa-
rately based on the length of the call and the distance between the caller and AFROTC. Use this or any
commercial toll service to reach AFROTC only when circumstances clearly support the cost of such calls.
Limit the duration of these calls. An “800” toll free number for units is not authorized unless totally
funded by host institutions.

33. Funding Approval for University Telecommunication Services:
   33.1. The University normally pays the cost for this service. However, if local institutional policies
   require departmental reimbursement, prepare and forward AF IMT 9 to HQ AFROTC for funding
   approval and processing. Once the AF IMT 9 is completed by HQ AFROTC, route it to the host base
   contracting officer to establish a contract with the university. (Only a contracting officer can establish
   a contractual agreement obligating Air Force funds.)
   33.2. If services need to continue to the next fiscal year, submit an advanced acquisition AF IMT 9 to
   AFOATS/FM in time to meet host base submission requirements (but not later than 15 June of the cur-
   rent fiscal year). Use historical data and any known changes in required support (for example, addition
   or reduction of personnel, change in telephone rates, etc.) to estimate future needs.
   33.3. All requests for increased funding must include a justification from the unit commander. If the
   funding is for telephone equipment, commercial business lines, or long distance service normally pro-
   vided by host institutions, the unit commander must describe the level of telephone support provided
   to all departments and all funds provided by the host school by category or type of expense. Evaluate
   each requirement for communications-computer systems separately for cost-effectiveness.

34. Bill Verification and Payment. The local telephone company may bill detachments for local ser-
vice, message units (if applicable), and long distance tolls. The institution may bill the detachment for
long distance calls and/or a prorata share of long distance costs when the telephone contract provides for
this service. In all cases, the detachment TCO will verify the accuracy of the bill with the completed AF
IMT 1072 or equivalent. The TCO will ensure the costs do not exceed the limits of the CSA or AF IMT
9. The TCO will certify the charges by submitting an AF IMT 649, Verification of Long Distance Tele-
phone Calls, and an SF 1034 with the invoice to the host base communications unit. The host base com-
munications unit billing clerk will compare and forward the voucher and invoice to the authorized CSA or
AF IMT 9 and send them to the base accounting and finance office for payment. One-time installation
charges and monthly line service charges will use AFROTC fund citation “EEIC 492.” Toll charges will
use “EEIC 495.”

35. IMTs Prescribed. AETC IMTs 1308, 1392, and 1393.

Terms
Access charge—The long distance carrier must pay this fee to the local telephone company for the use of
local lines connecting the customer to long distance service.
Access code—A digit or number of digits is required to access local or long distance service. For
example, a two-digit code (for example, 88) may be used for DSN access and a 14-digit access code is
often used with a calling card.
Call detail record (CDR)—This AT&T report itemizes all long distance telephone calls provided by the
FTS2001 network. The CDR is not a bill; it is used for the verification of long distance calls.
Defense Metropolitan Area Telephone Systems (DMATS)—DMATS provides telephone service to
DoD components through a single manager. A DMATS region covers a 30-mile minimum radius from the
center of a metropolitan area where several DoD components are located. DMATS is available in the
Dayton, OH, St Louis, MO, and Boston, MA, areas.
Federal Telecommunications System 2001 (FTS2001)—Congress mandated a GSA contract for long
distance telephone service through this system for the CONUS.
Flat-rate service—This is a fixed monthly rate for each business line with no additional cost for local
calls.
Hands-free speaker phone—This device permits two-way telephone conversation without removing the
handset from the instrument’s cradle.
Intralata calls—These calls remain in one geographical area known as a local access and transport area
(LATA). Long distance calls made within the LATA are known as intralata calls.
Interlata calls—These calls are made across different LATA boundaries. Long distance calls made
between two or more LATAs are known as interlata calls.
Key telephone instrument—This telephone can handle two or more lines and may be equipped with key
illumination, hold feature, and intercom.
Local access and transport area (LATA)—This geographical area is similar to one for area codes with
different boundaries. The LATA identifies the area of responsibility for intralata service (that is, within the
LATA) which includes local service. The local telephone company can provide local service (dial tone)
and intralata calling.
Local exchange carrier (LEC)—This local telephone company or any communication carrier that
provides the user with local service and access to long distance services.
Message units—These are fixed monthly charges for each business line, with the customer paying a fee
AETCI33-101 15 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                            17


for each call made. Use of this type of service is time and distance sensitive. A telephone call made within
a city may expend one message unit, while the same call made to a nearby town may take four message
units. This type of service is normally not used in offices placing a large number of outgoing call, but
could be cost-effective in an itinerary office.
Primary interexchange carrier (PIC)—This is the long distance company that provides long distance
service when dialing 1 plus. Examples of long distance providers for PIC are FTS2001, MCI, and Sprint.
Special features—These services are not normally provided with regular telephone service and do incur
additional charges. Examples are “call waiting,” “speed dialing,” and “call forwarding.”
Telephone call director—These telephone instruments are used to consolidate telephone numbers on one
telephone instrument assigned to an organization. These instruments are normally located at central
answering positions or in the commander’s office.
Telephone control officer (TCO)—This person is responsible for proper management and control of the
telephone service for the unit. The TCO is also responsible for related functions such as data
