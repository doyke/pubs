                                          Chapter 1

         GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PAMPHLET AND FUELS

1.1. Purpose of this pamphlet. This pamphlet provides logistics planning guidance for fuels
planners to aid in establishing petroleum support capabilities at locations other than US Air
Force main operating bases.
1.2. Basic Fuels Logistics Planning.
   1.2.1. The Air Force must maintain the ability to deploy rapidly and effectively to a variety
   of base environments ranging from bare bases to fully equipped, international airports. Once
   in place, US forces must be able to operate with the full spectrum of fuels support. A bare-
   base must have a runway, taxiway, and parking area adequate for the deployed force and an
   adequate source of water that can be made potable. Developed foreign military or civilian
   airfields may be comparable to true bare-base operations because of inadequate real estate
   and access to a runway. Deploying forces to these locations must prepare to support
   themselves as in a real bare-base environment.
   1.2.2. Experience has shown that fuels personnel at all levels may be required to provide
   fuels logistics planning to support exercises or real-world contingencies. While these
   persons may have little experience in the planning process, they are nevertheless expected to
   perform in field conditions, with limited technical supervision and communications. This
   publication provides basic guidance for managing the use of logistic resources and for
   ensuring that critical phases of the fuels planning process are not overlooked. It does not
   preclude the need to use other directives and technical orders. Information contained in this
   pamphlet should help you analyze mission requirements and allocate resources to develop an
   effective and efficient support package.
   1.2.3. The Department of Defense (DoD) wartime adaptive planning concept uses the Joint
   Operation Planning Execution System (JOPES) to develop operational plans. In response to
   short-notice contingencies, a shortened form of contingency planning known as the Crisis
   Action Planning (CAP) is used. Air Force JOPES guidance can be found in AFI 10-401, Air
   Force Operations Planning and Execution. Fuels planners are responsible for identifying
   petroleum and cryogenic requirements. They are also responsible for determining, arranging
   and executing the required support to meet mission demands. To do this requires at least a
   limited knowledge of the planning process. This publication helps provide that background.
   1.2.4. For the purpose of this pamphlet, a planning cycle is considered as (1) a preplanning
   phase where requirements are determined and an initial support proposal drafted; (2) a site
   survey phase to verify the feasibility of support proposal; (3) actual plan execution; and (4)
   after-action planning where the operation is analyzed for lessons learned. This pamphlet is
   designed to be especially helpful in those situations where phases 1 and 2 are compressed or
   eliminated. Attachment 2 gives fuels logistics planning guidance for use during planning and
   execution.
   1.2.5. All Fuels planners must refer to AFI 10-401 and AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning
   and Execution, for further guidance.

                                             Chapter 2

                           FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Major Command (MAJCOM) Fuels.
     2.1.1. The MAJCOM or their respective Numbered Air Force (NAF) personnel are
     responsible for the development of theater/base specific fuel support plans, providing support
     for Site Surveys and sourcing equipment and personnel required to support Air Forces
     operating in their Area of Responsibility. It is highly recommended that MAJCOM and NAF
     fuels personnel attend the Contingency War Planners Course (CWPC) at Maxwell AFB.
     Once fuels personnel have completed CWPC, they must follow the guidance in the Air Force
     Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) for award of the “R” prefix, Contingency War
     Planner.
2.2. The Combatant Commander (CCDR).
     2.2.1. The CCDR has the predominant fuels responsibility within a theater, the Joint
     Petroleum Office (JPO) discharges this responsibility. The JPO is responsible for the overall
     planning of petroleum logistic support for joint operations within their Area of Responsibility
     (AOR). This responsibility may be further delegated to a Sub-Area Petroleum Office
     (SAPO) responsible for a subset of the AOR. The JPOs work closely with their respective
     MAJCOM/Numbered Air Force service components and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)
     Energy to plan, coordinate, and oversee all phases of bulk petroleum support for US forces
     employed in theater. This includes arranging for movement of fuel and related products,
     personnel, and Fuels Support Equipment (FSE). Close coordination under the direction of
     the JPO/SAPO is critical to a successful joint operation.
2.3. DLA Energy.
     2.3.1. DLA Energy has the ultimate responsibility for procurement and contracting of fuel
     and cryogenics, as well as for fuel support at commercial locations and all international fuel
     agreements. Arrange for DLA Energy support through MAJCOM channels and the Air
     Force Petroleum Agency. If time does not permit DLA Energy support, temporary support
     may be arranged using the Aviation Into-Plane Reimbursement (AIR) Card® with existing
     into-plane contracts, the DD Form 1896, DoD Fuel Identaplate, or SF Form 44, Purchase-
     Order-Invoice-Voucher, at non into-plane contract locations, or by a memorandum of
     agreement between the host and the US senior commander. Refer to DLA Energy interim
     policies as applicable.
2.4. Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS).
     2.4.1. If available, a supply account must be established with the local LRS in order to
     establish a consumables readiness spares package (CRSP) for all fuels equipment assets. All
     stock listed items shall be ordered through the standard base supply system (SBSS). Items
     not stock listed must be purchased through the base Contracting office using local purchase
     procedures.
2.5. Air Force Petroleum Agency (AFPA). AFPA is the Air Force service control point for all
Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) fuel-related support issues.
AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013                                                                        7


   2.5.1. It Provides the warfighter and space launch activities with technical support and
   specialized capabilities in petroleum, propellants, cryogenics, alternative fuels, chemicals and
   gases for all aerospace vehicles, systems and equipment.
   2.5.2. Is a centralized support organization for AF Fuels Management teams.
   2.5.3. Provides direct support to wings and MAJCOMs for all day-to-day fuels management
   activities in addition to responsibilities listed in this paragraph.
   2.5.4. Develops quality assurance specifications and standardized agreements ensuring
   interoperability with commercial, inter-service, and international allied interests for
   sustainment of USAF, NATO, Joint, and combined force actions in steady state and
   expeditionary environments.
   2.5.5. Provides professional (analytical, scientific and engineering) services, to include
   contingency, operational and technical support to Air Force installations and fuels managers
   worldwide.
   2.5.6. Develops technical guidance and procedures related to fuel quality, infrastructure,
   equipment, vehicles, operations and maintenance for the fuels community. It also assists
   commanders with implementation of fuel product distribution and fuel quality programs.
   2.5.7. Evaluates and recommends new or improved technologies to enhance the
   effectiveness and efficiency of fuel operational support capabilities.
2.6. Fuels Management Team (FMT).
   2.6.1. Fuels management personnel are trained in all aspects of the fuels operation. Persons
   involved in exercise or contingency planning will have a working knowledge of tactical and
   mobile fuel systems. The senior fuels representative planning or deploying in support of an
   operation should be prepared to provide standardized refueling support in a nonstandard
   environment, and in many cases, one may have to work outside the normal chain of
   operations. Individuals selected to establish a deployed support capability will be aware that
   agencies normally available to arrange fuel support may not be available in time to meet
   operational needs. Fuels personnel are not authorized to enter into any agreements with
   foreign countries. Work with the Fuels MAJCOM staff responsible for the specific AOR to
   finalize any fuel agreement(s). NOTE: Be mindful that goods and services provided by a
   host nation entity may incur a cost to the US Government.
   2.6.2. Advanced Echelon (ADVON). Normally, for deployments to bare-base locations, an
   ADVON team, composed of a vast array of functional skills, precedes all other augmenting
   forces. Their function is to make necessary preparations at the location before the main
   forces arrive. It is critical that a senior fuels person be a part of any ADVON requiring fuel
   logistics support. This individual may serve as the senior fuels specialist responsible for the
   entire fuels operation during the deployment, employment, and redeployment phases.
2.7. Refueling Maintenance.
   2.7.1. Fuels personnel who possess the 028 Special Experience Identifier (SEI) are capable
   of maintaining the pumping systems on all refueling vehicles and FSE. However, Vehicle
   maintenance (2T3X1) personnel will ultimately be responsible for maintaining all refueling
   vehicles and FSE to include the power train and chassis.

2.8. Civil Engineers.
     2.8.1. In a bare-base environment, civil engineers maintain responsibilities for water and
     fuels systems maintenance (WFSM). Be advised that fixed fuel facilities will probably be
     under operational control of the host airport and not the responsibility of the Air Force
     engineers. Site preparation, including establishment of a base power grid, construction of
     berms and other environmental protection measures is still a civil engineer responsibility
     unless the services are provided through a Host Nation Support Agreement.
     2.8.2. The Clean Air Act (CAA, 40 CFR 50 through 99) and various state rules regulate air
     emissions from motor vehicles and non-road engines (excluding aircraft) by requiring
     pollution control equipment and mandating the use of low-sulfur (maximum of 500 parts per
     million) or ultra-low sulfur (maximum of 15 parts per million) diesel fuel. Jet fuels and
     many other tactical military specification fuels do not meet CAA’s low-sulfur or ultra-low
     sulfur diesel fuel standards. However, given the military’s need to rapidly deploy anywhere
     in the world, specialty controls and fuels for specific vehicles and non-road engines (e.g.,
     ground support equipment) are not practicable or even available. As a result, the DoD has
     obtained a national security exemption (NSE) from EPA allowing the use of “all required
     tactical military specification fuels” (e.g., JP-8, JP-5, Jet A, F-76, etc.) in diesel tactical
     vehicles and equipment, and for exemption from diesel vehicle pollution requirements (see
     40 CFR 89.908, National Security Exemption).
2.9. Airfield Management.
     2.9.1. Airfield Management is responsible for the base aircraft parking plan. The senior
     fuels representative must coordinate with Airfield Management to determine the best location
     to position fuel servicing equipment and when required, obtain proper approvals to position
     the equipment on the flightline.
AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013                                                                         9


                                            Chapter 3

                                     AIRFIELD SUPPORT

3.1. Airfield Surveys. To assist in future planning, attempt to obtain as much information as
possible on the fuel support capability at deployed operational locations. Attachment 3 may
serve as a guide to the type of information desired to update or correct existing information files.
Members deployed as part of an airfield survey will provide this information to the supporting
MAJCOM and NAF as part of the after action report. The Base Support and Expeditionary
(BAS&E) Site Planning Tool provides survey team’s the ability to capture, consolidate, and
warehouse site survey information based upon airfield survey functions (Chapter 19 Fuels). The
base or MAJCOM Logistics Plans office can provide user access based upon the member’s role
as a member of the site survey team or general user.
3.2. Host Nation Support. The fastest and most economical method of obtaining refueling
support is to obtain support from the host nation airfield. For this reason, host nation support
should be maximized before obligating organic fuel assets. Additionally, if the host cannot
provide complete support, a limited use of their facilities may be possible. US assets can,
thereby be used to augment any deficiencies. NOTE: Fuels personnel are not authorized to
enter into any agreements with foreign countries. Work with the Fuels MAJCOM staff
responsible for the specific AOR to finalize any fuel agreement(s).
3.3. Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). Arranging for fuel support, particularly with a
foreign government, may require the writing of a MOA or Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) between the United States Government and the host. Only certain agencies of the US
Government have the authority to enter into such agreements. DLA Energy performs this
function for fuel support or may delegate such authority. Fuels planners should at least be
familiar with this requirement.
3.4. Fuel Availability. JP-8 is the primary aviation fuel for US Air Force aircraft. Alternate
fuels include, but are not limited to, JP-5, Jet A, Jet A-1, Jet B, JP-4 and TS-1. NOTE: F-24 is
the NATO symbol for Jet A with additives. By definition, alternate fuels are those authorized for
continuous use and where operating limits, thrust outputs, and thrust transients shall not be
adversely affected. However, alternate fuels, particularly commercial grades, may not contain
additives, which could result in reduced performance parameters. The applicable flight manual
shall define limitations, if any, of a significant change to aircraft performance. For fuel
specifications and interchangeability, reference T.O. 42B1-1-14, Fuels for USAF Aircraft,
applicable aircraft flight manuals and Attachment 7.
   3.4.1. No single, reliable document is available which lists fuels availability at worldwide
   military and civil airfields. When deploying to locations outside the United States, the
   responsible MAJCOM/NAF should provide planning information. The Into-Plane Contract
   Information System (IPCIS) is available at the DLA Energy website, www.energy.dla.mil.
   The IPCIS provides a list of all DLA Energy into-plane contract locations worldwide. Also,
   the DLA Energy Regional Office typically has information on airfields within its region.
   This information is usually not limited to just the airfield’s fuels capability, but may also
   contain fuels infrastructure data, existing MOAs/MOUs with the host nation, and fuel
   resupply information.
 10                                                            AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013


       3.4.1.1. DoD Flight Information Publication (FLIP).              The National Geospatial-
       Intelligence Agency publishes these books, also known as En Route Supplements, which
       are available for worldwide regions. FLIPs are updated frequently and can be found at
       base operations flight planning facilities. Listings are by airport name (i.e., John F.
       Kennedy); however, FLIP includes a cross-reference of airport and city names. The
       listings give pertinent airfield information, including a summary of fuel available,
       contract refueling support, and cryogenic product availability. The publications give no
       indication as to quantities available or the rate of dispensing into aircraft. A legend at the
       beginning of each book provides further guidance on reading the airport summaries.
       3.4.1.2. Automated Air Facilities Information Files (AAFIF). AAFIF files provide the
       best available information on non-USAF and especially non-DoD installations
       worldwide. Information is not currently available for CONUS airfields. Because of
       sources used and the frequency of updating information files, information should be used
       with caution because it is not always accurate or current.
       3.4.1.3. Base Support Plan (BSP) or Expeditionary Site Plan (ESP). The fuels annex to
       the BSP/ESP is prepared according to AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site
       Planning, Attachment 21 and maintained by the logistics plans office. Normally a host
       base is designated for each known bare-base location and responsible for preparing the
       fuels annex for the plan. MAJCOM/NAF site surveys can be obtained using the BaS&E
       site planning tool located on the Air Force Portal.
3.5. Quality Control. Quality control of petroleum products is always a primary concern at
deployed locations. It is typically accomplished with a minimum amount of laboratory
equipment in less than ideal conditions and can be particularly critical when receiving fuel from
a foreign source. T.O. 42B-1-1, Quality Control of Fuels and Lubricants, provides guidance for
quality control procedures.
AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013                                                                        11


                                           Chapter 4

                                       FUEL SUPPORT

4.1. Computing Requirements.
   4.1.1. Determining fuel requirements may be relatively simple as in the case of supporting a
   few aircraft of one type, or extremely complex when providing support to a variety of aircraft
   from different commands, services and coalition countries. Since maximum lead-time is
   required to arrange fuel support, timeliness and accuracy in computing requirements are
   extremely important. The impact of underestimating requirements is obvious in that fuel
   supplies may run out. Limited bulk storage tankage capacities at bare-base locations could
   further complicate requirement computations. The impact of overestimating requirements
   may result in the end-user determining disposal or other uses at their expense. It is strongly
   advised to ensure accurate requirements are calculated to avoid any future logistical support
   issues with the host nation. The procedures listed below will help identify fuel requirements.
      4.1.1.1. Obtain the appropriate command portion of the Wartime Aircraft Activity
      (WAA) from the parent MAJCOM or local Logistic Plans Office for each Operational
      Plan (OPLAN) requiring support. Also, additional planning factors are obtained by
      accessing the AOR specific War and Mobilization Plan (WMP), Vol 4, Wartime Aircraft
      Activity Report (WAAR) and the WMP Vol 5, Basic Planning Factors and Data.
          4.1.1.1.1. Separate the WAA activity per OPLAN. NOTE: Each WAA contains
          activity including unit, sorties per day, gallons per sortie, and sortie generation factor
          (the F-Qty refers to the amount of fuel anticipated via in-flight. Exclude the F-Qty
          from requirements determination).
          4.1.1.1.2. Use the FSE Calculator to record each line of activity. One line of activity
          equals one aircraft Mission/Design/Series (MDS) and estimated gallons per sortie.
          The FSE Calculator will compute the total fuel requirement by aircraft type per day.
          The FSE Calculator computes consumption data taken from the WMP-4/WMP-5, and
          should be used to determine the activity’s MAX 1-day requirement. All FMTs in
          coordination with their MAJCOM FAM, will identify their MAX 1-Day requirement
          from the most stringent OPLAN their location supports. The determination will
          identify whether planned or current fuel stocks can support the OPLAN requirements.
          NOTE: The FSE Calculator should be an initial starting point for all MAJCOM
          planning efforts. The FSE calculator can be obtained by contacting your MAJCOM
          Fuels office.
   4.1.2. Information Source. The logistics planners involved in writing the support plan can
   normally provide the aircraft sortie generation requirements. Sortie requirements can then be
   converted to fuel and liquid oxygen (LOX)/liquid nitrogen (LIN) requirements. In reality,
   obtaining requirements is seldom a simple task, because changing guidelines and funding
   usually delays actual aircraft planning until the last minute. Attempt to finalize requirements
   as early as possible. Get the requirements in writing and carefully analyze inputs from all
   commands and services to make sure requirements appear realistic. Provide combined
   requirements by message to all concerned for review. Obtaining written requirements will
   protect you as a planner and help force users to adhere to their original stated plan. Using the
 12                                                              AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013


   single fuel on the battlefield concept, planners must ensure coordination with transportation,
   civil engineers and AGE personnel are completed to plan the need for ground product
   support. NOTE: Not all power equipment can run on Jet Fuel, we must ensure that
   equipment items can run on Jet Fuel without causing damage to the equipment.
   4.1.3. Computations. A sortie is defined as one aircraft flying mission. Flying requirements
   are stated as either a number of sorties to be flown each day or as a sortie rate. Compute the
   number of sorties to be flown in a single day by multiplying the number of aircraft available
   times the sortie rate (i.e., ten aircraft flying a 0.8 sortie rate equates to eight sorties per day).
   Planners may also provide the fuel on-load per aircraft in which case the daily fuel
   requirement can be computed by multiplying the number of sorties times the on-load per
   sortie. If operations planners provide only the planned average duration of a sortie, a
   reasonably accurate requirement forecast can be obtained by using consumption rates times
   the sortie duration in hours to arrive at a fuel on-load. LOX/LIN requirements are computed
   in a similar manner. Ground fuel requirements are discussed in paragraph 4.6. Sortie rates
   can be found by utilizing the War and Mobilization Plan (WMP), Vol 4 Wartime Aircraft
   Activity Report (WAAR) and the WMP Vol 5, Basic Planning Factors and Data.
4.2. Resupply Options. The supported combatant commander's JPO is responsible for the
overall planning of petroleum logistic support for joint operations within the area of
responsibility. This planning occurs at the strategic level and usually is embodied in the
petroleum appendix to the logistics annex of the OPLAN or operation plan in concept format
(CONPLAN). The petroleum appendix covers theater-wide fuel requirements, resupply, and
distribution. The format for fuels planning is prescribed in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Manual (CJCSM) 3122.03C, Joint Operation Planning and Execution System Vol. II,
Planning Formats and Guidance. The DLA Energy Regional Offices and Service components
support the JPO in developing a practical, sustainable petroleum support concept and plan.
   4.2.1. The Inland Petroleum Distribution Plan (IPDP). The IPDP provides a single source
   document for understanding how the guidance provided in the OPLAN or operation order
   (OPORD) will be executed. It provides the details necessary for Service component
   commanders to understand how to interface with units, agencies, and firms providing
   petroleum support. The petroleum portions of the OPLAN or OPORD provide an executive
   summary while the IPDP contains the details supporting the summary.
   4.2.2. When the host airfield is unable to provide actual aircraft refueling, it becomes
   necessary to establish a fuel dispensing capability (paragraph 3.2) and obtain fuel from a bulk
   source. The simplest and most expedient method of resupply is usually to use the same
   source of supply used by the host airfield, through arrangements with DLA Energy and the
   supplier or the airfield as negotiated by DLA Energy or the State Department. The following
   options may apply where resupply is inadequate or not available:
       4.2.2.1. Overland Distribution. IAW Joint Publication 4-03, Joint Bulk Petroleum and
       Water Doctrine, the Army normally provides management of overland petroleum
       support, including inland waterways, to US land-based forces of all DoD components.
       The Army organization responsible for bulk fuel distribution at the operational level is
       the Petroleum Group. It commands primarily petroleum pipeline and terminal operating
       battalions/companies and medium truck petroleum battalions/companies. These units
       operate and maintain petroleum distribution facilities to support the theater petroleum
AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013                                                                       13


       mission. The primary methods of movement may include the Inland Petroleum
       Distribution System (IPDS) or Tank Trucks (number varies between the battalions and
       companies).
       4.2.2.2. Ocean Tanker. The Navy shall provide seaward and over-the-shore bulk
       petroleum products to the high-water mark for US Sea and land-based forces of all DoD
       components. JPO/SAPO through coordination with DLA Energy can arrange for tanker
       shipments of fuel to an available port if given enough lead time. Dependent on location
       and timing, tankers at sea may be diverted to meet a contingency requirement.
   4.2.3. Aerial Delivery. Aerial Bulk Fuel Delivery System (ABFDS) and 500 gallon
   collapsible drums. The ABFDS is designed for aerial delivery of fuel into locations where
   other methods of transportation are impractical. The system has been certified for bulk
   transport of all types of liquid fuel, including AVGAS. While the ABFDS can carry from
   3,000 to 30,000 gallons per sortie it is not a cost effective or an efficient means of providing
   fuel resupply especially when trying to support large flying operations, and as such should
   only be considered when all other means of resupply have been exhausted. Extreme care
   must be exercised concerning fuel commingling if multiple grades of fuel are being delivered
   using ABFDS or 500-gallon collapsible drums.
4.3. Aircraft Systems. The use of aircraft as the primary resupply mode for fuel is permitted
only after all other possible means of support have been exhausted. Airlift is an expensive
means of movement with very limited capability.
   4.3.1. Cargo Aircraft. Air Mobility Command (AMC)
       4.3.1.1. Equipment; C-130, C-17, and C-5 aircraft.
       4.3.1.2. Primary Function. Airlift of cargo and personnel.
       4.3.1.3. Alternate Functions. ABFDS with alternate capability equipment (ACE) for
       filtration of aviation fuels, 500 gallon drum transport, wet-wing defueling, and aircraft-to
       aircraft refueling.
       4.3.1.4. Interoperability. All AMC aircraft are equipped with the single point refueling
       receptacle. The single point refueling nozzle and adequate length of discharge
       (collapsible) hose are required for wet wing refueling the aircraft. Normally, nozzle and
       hose will be provided by the receiver. These cargo aircraft are interoperable with all
       rotary wing aircraft (except US Army and US Marine Corps UH-1 and OH-6), US
       Marine Corps and US Navy ground systems, and US Army M970 aviation road tankers.
   4.3.2. Tanker Aircraft. AMC
       4.3.2.1. Equipment. KC-135 and KC-10 aircraft
       4.3.2.2. Primary Function. In-flight refueling
       4.3.2.3. Alternate Functions. KC-135 for passenger or limited cargo; KC-10 for
       passenger and fuel transport for on-ground defueling.
4.4. Storage Options. Storage requirements may be met by bladder systems, railroad tank cars;
or any container meeting operational and safety needs. The first option should always be to
maximize use of host storage facilities to minimize the construction of berms and use of
bladders. The method of resupply, movement of fuel to US dispensing systems, security
 14                                                           AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013


requirements, and the need for blending of additives should be considered in the planning.
Utmost importance must be given to right-size bladder storage based on the Combatant
Commander’s (CCDR) Days of Supply (DOS) objective. For example, the CCDR may require 5
DOS stock objective. A location with an 84K gallon a day requirement would be required to
store 420K gallons of product. The location could choose to store the product in two each 210K
bladders, nine 50K bladders or one 210K and five 50K bladders. Other factors such as
resupply/availability may also play in to any given scenario, but right-sizing is important in
reducing lift and stress on limited equipment levels.
4.5. Additives. Military fuel specifications require distinct additives (corrosion
inhibitor/lubricity improver (CI/LI), fuel system icing inhibitor (FSII), and Static Dissipating
Additive (SDA), which are not always available in commercial jet fuels. Refer to T.O. 42B-1-1
for procedures on additive blending. When using commercial jet fuels consult the aircraft dash 1
Technical Data for additive requirements and/or flight restrictions when not using additives.
While AMC tankers do not require additized fuel to operate, certain high performance aircraft
do. Tankers flying air refueling support of these aircraft do carry additized fuel. Additives pose
a particular problem for the fuels planner because host airports will not normally allow additives
in their systems. An air-transportable additive injection team Unit Type Code (UTC) JFDE2 can
be used at any commercial fuel source, without having to introduce additives directly into the
commercial, military, and/or other fueling systems. This cart can be installed between the
dispensing equipment and the skin of the aircraft. It is commonly referred to as the “Mendez
Cart”. Additionally, due to USAF flow rates, SDA is required for most fuel handling operations.
Due to lubricity requirements, CI/LI should be available when using jet fuel for ground support
equipment. Fuel additives can be ordered IAW DLA Energy I-33, Fuel Additive Requisition
Procedures. See additional information on additives and additive injectors in attachments 10 and
11.
4.6. Ground Fuels. Ground products are of equal importance with aviation fuel and will
probably be required before aircraft arrival to support communications and ground power
equipment.
   4.6.1. UTC JFDSD is available in the Open the Airbase AETF Force Module. UTC JFDSD
   provides a 500 GL sealed drum kit for initial ground support operations.
   Consideration/Priority may need to be given to how this fuel is to be used until a resupply
   source can be established. 4.6.2. Follow-on ground fuel support equipment is the Tactical
   Automated Service Station (TASS), UTC JFDSS. The TASS:
       4.6.2.1. Provides a self-serve, automated ground fuel station for support equipment and
       vehicles.
       4.6.2.2. Can service two different grades of fuel or have two nozzles for a single grade.
       4.6.2.3. Is designed to connect to multiple type fuel sources ranging from bladders,
       portable tanks, and 6K gallon trucks via multiple adapters.
   4.6.3. Requirements can be difficult to determine as there are multiple items that can affect
   your need. If not careful in determining your ground fuel requirements they can easily be
   overestimated. The FSE calculator uses base population to determine ground fuel
   requirements. It uses the standard planning factor of 2.1 gallons per person for Diesel fuel
   and .5 gallons per person for MOGAS. Using only population to determine ground fuel
AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013                                                                            15


   requirements is a good starting point; however, Fuels Planners in addition to using base
   population should still coordinate with potential using agencies such as transportation, civil
   engineers, security forces, communicators, AGE, and aircraft maintenance for a better
   understanding of their actual need.
   4.6.4. Receipt, storage, and issue procedures are basically the same as for aviation fuels
   except that smaller dispensing systems are normally required.
   4.6.5. Most countries use unleaded gasoline; however, some countries still have leaded
   products. If there is a requirement for gasoline verify unleaded is available, if not consider
   minimizing vehicles with catalytic converters. Additionally, leaded gasoline often has octane
   ratings far below the acceptable limits for AF vehicles.
4.7. Personnel and Equipment Requirements. MAJCOMs/NAFs are responsible for
determining and coordinating all personnel and equipment requirements, as well as which UTCs
are going to be tasked. As the fuels planner, your early submission of requirements to the
MAJCOM is crucial. A deployment requirements chart, Attachment 8, is provided as a guideline
for estimating personnel and equipment requirements. This chart is not all inclusive. You
should exercise caution to ensure personnel with the needed special experience identifiers (SEI)
and the correct types of equipment are sourced. Additionally, you should state all requirements
for other non-refueling vehicles needed in the fuels operations. Also, as the Fuels Planner it is
your responsibility to coordinate all types of communications (COMM) requirements (computer
and phone) and Personal Wireless Communication Systems (PWCS) with associated
organizations. Although it is not the responsibility of the fuels planner to coordinate for WFSM,
it is in the best interest of the entire fuels operation to identify any needed skill sets, if required.

                                            Chapter 5

                        FUELS EQUIPMENT INTEROPERABILITY

5.1. Dispensing Options. Allowance Standard 154 identifies all fuels and cryogenics War
Readiness Material (WRM). This equipment is air transportable in C-130 or larger aircraft.
Considering the logistics problems and high cost and limited availability of airlift, equipment
moves should be minimized and host assets used where possible. If time permits, inquire if
sealift is an option to move the maximum equipment possible to minimize airlift requirements.
At the same time, consider the need for immediate refueling support and past experience where
extensive damage has been the result of moving air transportable systems by surface
transportation. WRM equipment is stored in several locations throughout the world. While
WRM equipment can be issued for peacetime disaster and contingency support, it is governed
under AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures.
5.2. Joint Interoperability. Joint operations between the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine
Corps, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nations are becoming increasingly
important and more frequent. Because fuel is a common item among services/NATO nations,
delivery of this product into a joint combat environment is one aspect the planner considers and
integrates to ensure successful accomplishment of the mission. The services have traditionally
maintained fuel equipment tailored to their own particular needs. Nonstandard refueling
techniques may have to be employed to support joint combat operations. Attachment 9 contains
a listing of the services' major fuel equipment, including the description and interoperability-
considerations.
5.3. Nonstandard Refueling Operations. Nonstandard refueling operations are primarily
between services of a joint force in which fuel is passing from a unique source, such as aircraft
fuel tanks, into a receiving aircraft, ground support storage, or a transport vehicle. It is not
within the context of this pamphlet to address all nonstandard refueling considerations that exist.
These operations may also include fuel support between two services conducting ground or sea
operations. An example of this would be US Air Force helicopters refueling aboard a Navy
vessel. Other examples of nonstandard refueling operations include wet wing defueling to
equipment and vehicles and aircraft-to-aircraft refueling. Nonstandard refueling operations are
not the primary purpose of US Air Force cargo and tanker aircraft. You should conduct these
operations only in time-constrained situations where ground fuel resupply means are not
reasonably available in forward areas, and acceptable conditions exist to permit air delivery of
fuel. Consider this type of operation as a last resort after all other methods of delivery, including
sling-load delivery of bladders, or delivery by pipelines, rail, or road tankers, as well as host
nation support. The key rule is to follow published technical order procedures for each particular
circumstance.
   5.3.1. Wet Wing Defueling. Wet wing defueling involves transferring fuel from fixed-wing
   aircraft fuel tanks to collapsible fabric tanks or tank semi-trailers. This method of bulk fuel
   resupply allows the aircraft to carry an internal load of dry cargo plus jet fuel without
   requiring additional aircraft to provide fuel support. Wet wing defueling can supplement
   other bulk fuel delivery systems. Refer to T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and
   Static Grounding and Bonding, for aircraft approved for wet wing defueling. Using the
   correct procedures, wet wing defueling from the single point refueling (SPR) port of these
AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013                                                                        17


   aircraft into collapsible fabric tanks/bladders or tank semi trailers can be done with an
   acceptable degree of risk.
   5.3.2. Aircraft-To-Aircraft Refueling. This type of operation is the transfer of fuel from
   cargo or tanker aircraft fuel tanks into another aircraft while on the ground. The procedures
   for aircraft-to-aircraft refueling are identical to wet wing defueling operations except for the
   nozzles used. The SPR nozzle is required for refueling all US Air Force, Navy, and Marine
   Corps aircraft. The closed-circuit refuel (CCR) nozzle or open port nozzle is required for the
   US Army OH-58 and UH-1 aircraft, while the SPR, CCR, or open port nozzles can be used
   for all other Army rotary wing aircraft.
   5.3.3. Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP) Operations. FARP operations are hot refueling
   operations that are normally conducted at night under austere conditions using the Forward
   Area Manifold Cart (FAM Cart) approved equipment in the FAM Cart Manual and T.O. 00-
   25-172, Ground Servicing and Static Grounding/Bonding; and listed in AFI 11-235, Forward
   Area Refueling Point (FARP) Operations Attachment 2. This type of operation is aircraft-to-
   aircraft transfer of fuel using the specified equipment listed in the preceding references and
   can service fixed wing and rotary aircraft from all services using SPR, CCR, or open port
   nozzles. FARP operations are normally conducted on C-130 and C-17 aircraft using certified
   FARP personnel.
5.4. Couplings, Nozzles, and Adaptors. Please refer to T.O. 37A-1-101 for a list of couplings,
nozzles, and adaptors applicable to each system. Additionally, the attachment contains an
interoperability matrix. To determine if two systems are compatible, examine the couplings and
adaptors available on each system. For example, C-17 has only the SPR adaptor, and the US
Army Fuel System Supply Point (FSSP) has no single point refueling nozzle to connect to the
aircraft. Therefore, using a provider and receiver rule, the US Army (the receiver) must secure a
SPR nozzle and enough hose to reach the aircraft before the two systems are interoperable.
Unique circumstances may cause variation from this rule in order to efficiently achieve
interoperability. For example, when an aircraft is diverted to an installation to receive fuel for
delivery to another site, the providing organization at that installation would provide the required
couplings. This is established because of the operational time constraint and the impracticality
of equipping the aircraft with all couplings and adaptors needed to interface with all systems.

                                        CRYOGENICS

6.1. Availability. Consult the DoD Flight Information Publication to determine availability of
liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen products at a particular airfield. Ensure liquid oxygen and
nitrogen meets quality standards IAW T.O. 42B6-1-1, Quality Control of Aviator’s Breathing
Oxygen and T.O. 42B7-3-1-1, Quality Control of Nitrogen, either through testing or review of
quality documents. If sources are not readily available, the product can be airlifted using a 400
or 500 gallon capacity tank equipped with an overboard vent kit.
6.2. Storage. Mobility tanks are available for deployment; however, host nation tanks should be
used whenever possible. Contact your MAJCOM/NAF fuels office for details. LOX tank fittings
may vary from country to country, particularly on commercial delivery vehicles. Adaptors may
have to be constructed for support.
6.3. Issue. Use standard issue procedures. Fill removable aircraft converters directly from
storage tanks where possible to avoid double handling and the resultant loss associated with a
LOX cart servicing.
6.4. Requirements. DLA Energy can also assist with the procurement of cryogenic products.
Contact AOR specific MAJCOM/NAF for newly defined requirements. The MAJCOMs/NAF
will engage with DLA regions and/or AFPA.
   6.4.1. Determining cryogenic (LOX/LIN) requirements is comparable to determining fuel
   requirements. The same source document (WAA from the parent MAJCOM or local
   Logistic Plans Office for each OPLAN) will be required to establish an accurate estimate.
   Since maximum lead-time is required to arrange cryogenic support, timeliness and accuracy
   in computing requirements are extremely important. The following procedures will help in
   identifying cryogenic requirements:
       6.4.1.1. Determine your MAX 1-day by identifying the cryogenic requirement for each
       airframe at your location. Take into consideration several airframes have self-generating
       capabilities and do not have a LOX requirement. There is also the availability of self-
       generating LIN carts that may be available to meet the deployed location’s LIN
       requirement.
       6.4.1.2. To determine the requirement for each airframe, take the cryogenic fill quantity,
       which is reflected in liters, and multiply by 0.2642 (conversion factor for liters to
       gallons). Next take this converted quantity and multiply by 70% (fill capacity of
       cryogenic converter) (i.e. for the U-2 with two 10 liter converters, 10L x 2 * 0.2642 x
       70% = 3.7 gallons). This quantity reflects a per aircraft requirement in gallons which will
       be used along with the WAA and OPLAN to determine your max one day requirement.
   6.4.2. The MAX 1-day should be used to project equipment and manpower requirements.
   The FSE Calculator will allow you to manually input equipment and manpower additions
   based on MAX 1-day requirements and the deployed environment.

                                      SPECIAL FUELS

7.1. Thermally Stable Jet Fuel (JPTS). JPTS is a special petroleum product, which is only for
support of U-2 aircraft. JPTS is a narrow cut kerosene type fuel with several critical properties
that are extremely sensitive to contamination. Storage and handling of JPTS will be IAW T.O.
42B1-1-16, Quality Control Procedures for JPTS Thermally Stable Turbine Fuels.
   7.1.1. Inventory and accounting procedures for JPTS fuel will be IAW DoD 4140.25-M,
   Management of Bulk Petroleum Products, Natural Gas and Coal, and DLA Energy interim
   policies and procedures. Because of its special characteristics, JPTS is available only from a
   limited number of refineries and from pre-positioned storage throughout the world.
   Movement is by railroad tank car or tank truck within the CONUS; by specialized 6,000
   gallon Bulk Fuel Containers (BFC) to overseas locations. JPTS requires special ordering and
   forecasting procedures. Information concerning special fuels may be obtained by contacting
   your Component Command or your MAJCOM/NAF A4 staffs respectively.
   7.1.2. Because of their critical properties, JPTS requires special storage and handling. As a
   minimum, storage tanks should be epoxy coated; and pipelines, pump components, etc. that
   come in contact with the fuel must be of non-corrosive materials such as stainless steel IAW
   UFC 3-460-01. T.O. 42B1-1-16, Chapter 8 outlines procedures for using fuel bladders for
   storage tanks for JPTS.
7.2. Aviation Gasoline (AVGAS). AVGAS is a specialized fuel used only in support of
Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). AVGAS also requires special handling and storage it is
extremely sensitive to environmental conditions that can cause the product to go off-
specification.
   7.2.1. Monitoring and maintaining the quality of AVGAS is critical. Specific guidance and
   test requirements on the quality control of AVGAS are found in T.O. 42B1-1-22, Quality
   Control of Aviation Gasoline. Additional guidance can be found in MIL-STD- 3004, Quality
   Assurance/Surveillance for Fuels, Lubricants and Related Products.

                                           Chapter 8

                         ADMINISTRATION AND ACCOUNTING

8.1. Reporting. The web based JCS Bulk Petroleum Contingency and Capabilities Report
(REPOL), located on the SIPRNet, provides the Joint Staff, CSAF, CCDR, AF/A4LE and the
MAJCOMs with summary information on the damage and deficiencies affecting bulk petroleum
supplies, storage and distribution systems. When required, submit REPOL reports according to
CJCSM 3150.14B, Joint Reporting Structure or when requested. Combatant commanders will
provide the frequency of reporting. The primary responsibility is to provide an accurate status to
the senior commander who has to make operational decisions.
8.2. Security. All aspects of security should receive special emphasis in a deployed operation.
Physical security of fuel systems becomes critical because of the lack of hardening in portable
system design. Additionally, the normal perimeter security, lighting, and security patrols may
not be provided to the same extent as a main operating base. Ensure the proper storage of
classified information. Remember that actions taken during an exercise or contingency reflect
actual operation plans and may reveal classified procedures and capabilities to unauthorized
persons.
8.3. Communications. You should ensure adequate consideration of communications in the
planning process, or upon arrival at a contingency location. Do not plan to deploy with radios
from your main operating base without first consulting with communications specialists involved
in the deployment planning. Radio frequencies may not be compatible with those of the
deployed area and may interfere with the host radio frequencies. Only use electronic devices
IAW T.O. 00-25-172 and T.O. 37-1-1 in and around fuels environments.
8.4. Transportation. You should arrange adequate transportation to support fuels operations.
Transportation requirements include support for routine flight line operations, resupply needs,
and transporting personnel to off-site locations. Transportation requirements can also include
transporting fuels personnel to and from quarters when work shifts or location does not permit
use of normal shuttle bus services.
8.5. Accounting. Issue of fuel at a deployed site requires all the normal accounting procedures
required at a main operating base, unless issues are completely performed utilizing into-plane
contract or SF Form 44 Purchase-Order-Invoice-Voucher. If daily issue processing into the
Business System Modernization-Energy (BSM-E)/Fuels Enterprise Server is not possible, then
give special consideration to orderly file maintenance procedures to accomplish processing at a
later date. It is also important to note that commercial vendors or foreign governments may not
want US accounting documents. Determine what alternate documentation agreement will satisfy
their needs. Use of alternate documentation does not negate the need for those documents
required by DoD 4140-25-M. Refer to DoD 4140.25-M and/or its applicable interim
policies/procedures for accounting for DLA Energy owned fuel in contingency locations.
8.6. Deployed Fuel Dispensing Vehicle/Equipment Deficiency Reporting. Fuel dispensing
vehicle/equipment (Mobile Refuelers, FSE, etc.) deficiencies that impact the operational safety,
suitability, and effectiveness of systems or equipment deployed which could lead to fuel spills,
fuel contamination, fire, product loss, personal injury, equipment/property damage, or
equipment/parts failing to meet their specified use life need to be reported immediately. Wing
AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013                                                                 21


QA and Vehicle Maintenance are the fuels managers’ conduit to the Joint Deficiency Reporting
System (JDRS). Deployed fuels managers will report any fuel dispensing vehicle/equipment
deficiencies to their respective Air and Space Operations Center (AOC). The AOC will notify
the respective lead command for the theater operations of the deficiency. The lead MAJCOM
will notify the Global Manager. The Global Manager will notify the Air Force Logistics Center
Management Complex (AFLCMC) with an info copy to the AFPA. Only the AFLCMC will
contact the vehicle/equipment manufacture with deficiency concerns. Deployed fuels managers
will document deficiencies in the JDRS IAW T.O. 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting,
Investigation and Resolution. See Attachment 15, for in-garrison FSE program management,
structures, and responsibilities.

                                        PERSONNEL

9.1. Responsibilities. Contingency operations frequently create additional stress on personnel.
The LRS Commander must evaluate command structure at the deployed site to ensure an
effective chain of command.
9.2. Management. The deployed Commander holds the responsibility of setting the example,
as well as the responsibility to enforce discipline within the fuels flight.
9.3. Morale and Welfare. The Fuels Management Team is responsible for the care of assigned
fuels personnel and equipment. They should look for ways to improve the quality of life for
deployed personnel when practical.
9.4. Host Nation Relations. Military and civilian fuels personnel of other nations may not have
the same equipment, procedures, or standards that we do. These differences may create
additional challenges for fuels operations, particularly with safety standards, deal with them in
the most diplomatic manner possible.
AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013                                                                     23


                                          Chapter 10

                       FUELS FORCE MODULES (IAW AFI 10-401)

10.1. The AETF force modules. The AETF force modules are a method of packaging
command and control, operational mission, and ECS forces for presentation to a combatant
commander through the commander, Air Force forces (COMAFFOR). The modules were
developed to provide a standardized template optimizing initial planning through rapid
requirements generation. The AETF force modules consist of six scalable, modular elements:
Open the Airbase, Command and Control, Establish the Airbase, Generate the Mission, Operate
the Airbase, and Robust the Airbase. When utilized in concert, the scalable AETF force modules
provide capabilities required to open, establish, and operate an air expeditionary wing (AEW) or
group (AEG). AEGs are normally formed utilizing the Generate the Mission force modules as
tenant organizations at an Air Force, joint, or coalition operating location as long as the
Service/nation responsible for providing base operating support can provide sufficient support
capabilities for the AEG to establish adequate command and control over assigned/allocated
forces. Each element is built on capabilities required to accomplish specific processes necessary
to achieve desired effects. The capabilities contained within each module element are designed
to work synergistically. Component headquarters may modify the capabilities within the FMs
based upon the situation and mission requirements. The AETF force modules are all built on
basic planning assumptions which are periodically validated at AETF FM workshops and
maintained by AF/A5XW.
10.2. AEF Sourcing Plans and Tasks Timeline. To ensure the Air Force is ready for each
AEF rotation, AFPC/DPW will distribute an AEF Sourcing Plans and Tasks message outlining
critical tasks to be accomplished by responsible OPRs approximately 9 months prior to the AEF
vulnerability start date. All component headquarters and MAJCOMs are required to adhere to
the milestones in this message to ensure the development/modification of the ECS CPS and
orderly presentation of capability to the combatant commanders. The timeline may be
compressed for crisis action TPFDDs and during periods of deviation from the normal AEF
battle rhythm. Each AEF Sourcing Plans and Tasks message with corresponding timeline will be
posted on the AEF Operations NIPR and SIPR website.
10.3. AEF Schedule Preparation Timeline. The AEF Schedule timeline is required to meet
the Joint Staff Global Force Management (GFM) Master Timeline. These milestones will be
modified as necessary to meet the GFM Master Timeline. Prior to each 24-month AEF
Schedule, Air Force leaders, planners, and Functional Area Managers (FAM) at every level
review lessons learned, make assessments of significant force structure changes that have
impacted the Air Force or a particular functional area, and consider initiatives that may impact
the way we posture, schedule, present, or execute combat capability. AF/A3/5 will publish
specific milestones to support the AEF Schedule timeline. As co-chairs of the AEF Steering
Group, AF/A5X and AFPC/CC will monitor the tasks associated with planning for the upcoming
AEF Schedule. Air Force planners and commanders, as well as HAF, MAJCOM, and
component headquarters FAMs must ensure their actions are completed in accordance with
published timelines.

Terms
Additive— An agent used for improving existing characteristics or for imparting new
characteristics to certain petroleum products (examples are fuel system icing inhibitor and
corrosion inhibitor).
Advanced Echelon (ADVON)— An initial deployment element of personnel and equipment
within a specific UTC. The ADVON portion of a UTC normally consists of the equipment and
personnel required to establish an austere operational capability for a period of up to 7 days.
Aerospace Fuels Laboratory— A laboratory which provides testing services on samples of
petroleum and related products to bases and conducts specification tests to determine the quality
of products in storage and under procurement.
Alternate Capability Equipment— Hose and filter assembly that allows aircraft to be refueled
direct from the ABFDS.
Alternate Fuel— Per T.O. 42B1-1-14, an alternate fuel is, "a fuel authorized for continuous use.
The operating limits, thrust outputs and thrust transients, shall not be adversely affected. The
applicable aircraft flight manual shall define limitations, if any, of a significant nature on aircraft
AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013                                                                     29


performance parameters such as range, altitude, loiter time, or rate of climb, and engine
performance parameters, such as specific fuel consumption or starting and stopping time. The
use of an alternate fuel may result in a change of maintenance or overhaul cost. External engine
trim adjustments may be necessary or desirable for use of an alternate fuel."
American Petroleum Institute (API)— Institute that represents and is supported by the
petroleum industry. It standardizes the tools and equipment used by the industry and promotes
the advancement of research in the petroleum field.
American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International— Organization which
provides standardized laboratory testing procedures, in the form of ASTM handbooks, to ensure
all laboratories use the same procedures and tests.
API Gravity— Arbitrary scale for measuring the density of liquid petroleum products adopted
by the American Petroleum Institute. Gravity is important to petroleum personnel because it can
indicate which product is heavier in relation to a comparative product and is, therefore, used in
product identification.
Aviation Gasoline (AVGAS)— Aviation gasoline for reciprocating engine aircraft. AVGAS is
characterized by a low distillation range and a high vapor pressure. AVGAS may contain
tetraethyl lead.
Bare Base— Base that has a runway, a taxiway, a parking area, and a source of water that can be
made potable.
Barrel (bbl)— A standard unit of measurement of petroleum liquids, consisting of 42 US
standard gallons at 60 degrees F. A barrel is not a container, but is commonly confused with a
drum.
Base Operating Support (BOS)— The provision of support to personnel or forces transiting or
remaining at a permanent or expeditionary site by a CCDR Service Component or JTF. BOS
services and support will be provided on a reimbursable basis between the BOS Integrator and
any organization that uses the support or service unless otherwise directed by the CCDR.
Coordination and management of BOS is provided by a BOS-Integrator (BOS-I) as assigned by
the CCDR.
Berm Liner— Used to protect the collapsible fuel bladder from damage that may be caused by
ground surfaces; and protects the ground surface environment from fuel leaks. The berm liner
also allows product recovery after fuel leaks and bladder ruptures.
Black Cargo (dirty cargo)— A general term used to describe liquid cargoes of crude oil or fuel
oils; important because of necessary cleaning of the black cargo container to be used for clean
fuels.
Boiling Point— The temperature at which a substance begins to boil or to be converted into
vapor by bubbles forming within the liquid. The temperature varies with the atmospheric
pressure; important in refining because different products boil at different temperatures.
BOS Integrator (BOS-I)— A CCDR designated representative who acts as the joint BOS
Integrator for the requesting personnel or forces. A CCDR may designate a Service Component
or JTF as the BOS-I at each operating location. The BOS-I will coordinate contracting support
and the efficient use of mission support resources. Where shortfalls or opportunities for
efficiencies exist, the CCDR may task components of JTFs to provide or coordinate specific
 30                                                            AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013


capabilities (e.g. series, infrastructure, security and communications). The BOS-I will provide
master planning for facilities and real estate. BOS-I responsibilities may include, but are not
limited to collecting and prioritizing construction requirements, seeking funding support,
environmental management, force protection and hazardous waste disposal.
Bulk Petroleum Products— A liquid petroleum product transported by various means and
stored in tanks or containers having an individual fill capacity greater than 260 liters.
Business System Modernization-Energy (BSM-E)—A vertically integrated automated
information system consisting of base-level components and “enterprise” level systems
providing visibility of bulk fuel assets and transactions to Services, CCDRs, vendors, and DLA
Energy.
C-Day— The unnamed day on which a deployment operation will commence. The deployment
may be movement of troops, cargo, weapon systems, or a combination of these elements
utilizing any or all types of transport. The letter C will be the only one used to denote the above.
The highest command or headquarters responsible for coordinating the planning will specify the
exact meaning of C-day within the aforementioned definition.
Cetane Number— Diesel fuel ignitability performance measured by the delay of combustion
after injection of the fuel. It represents a comparison of a fuel with standards which are cetane in
alpha-methyl-napthalene. The cetane number is related to operating and starting characteristics
at low temperatures. The higher the cetane value, the better or easier the starting capability.
Varying designs of diesel engines require various types of diesel fuels of varying cetane
numbers. In general, large, slow-speed diesel engines of stationary installations do not require
high cetane numbers (below 40); smaller, high-speed engines having 1,000 rpm or more require
fuels of high cetane number (above 40).
Collapsible Coated Fabric Tanks— Collapsible fuel tanks are normally provided in 10,000,
50,000, or 210,000 gallon capacity. Tanks are constructed of a single ply, nylon fabric material,

1 EMERGENCY ONLY
2 Blended with 50% Diesel (DF-2 only) by volume. Aviation Fuel Grade JP-4 (or Jet B) should
be used only when no other fuels are available. JP-4 (or Jet B) and mixtures of JP-4 (or Jet B)
and other fuels are dangerous due to the extremely low flash point of the JP-4 (or Jet B). When
this fuel or fuel mixtures must be used in DAY TANKS or operating tanks located inside
buildings or structures, every precaution must be taken to protect the product from any ignition
source. Base Ground Safety Personnel must be consulted prior to implementing use of JP-4 in
diesel engines. Tanks containing this mixture should be temporarily marked - BLENDED FUEL
IN USE — DANGER
3 Some units powered by diesel fuels are authorized to operate on JP-5/JP-8 as a primary or
alternate fuel. Refer to the applicable equipment manual for instructions.
4 Blending and burning alternate fuels with conventional boiler fuel must be coordinated with
civil engineering at command level. For detailed engineering data on blending, contact the Air
Force Civil Engineer Center, AFCEC/CESM, 139 Barnes Drive, Suite 1, Tyndall AFB, FL
32403-5319; COMM - (850) 283-6222, DSN - 523-6222.
5 Blended 50/50 with JP-4. Under no circumstances should this blend be premixed and stored.

A5.1. Operations at a deployed, bare-base location require adequate administrative and
housekeeping supplies to support the mission. At the same time, consideration must be given to
cost of airlift; therefore, supplies should be kept to the minimum essential required. The JFDAE
(Ops Kit), JFDAL (Lab Kit), and JFDEC (Cryogenic Kit) provide a specific list of items and
quantities for initial bare base capability based on individual need. These kits are stored in WRM
storage facilities located in PACAF, USAFE, AFCENT and CONUS. Additionally, the JFDES
(Fuels Support Kit) provides an all inclusive fuels support capability. The complete contents list
(packing list) of these kits may be obtained at any local Logistics Plans Office/Fuels MAJCOM
staff or by utilizing the Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging MEFPAK tool located on the
Air Force Portal.

                             AIRCRAFT PLANNING FACTORS

A7.1. AIRCRAFT PLANNING FACTORS The following factors are for contingency or
exercise planning only. Fuel and LOX quantities are averages. Actual consumption varies due
to mission profile. Helicopter length is the length of the fuselage, while the span is the main
rotor diameter. All fuel quantities are in US gallons. Normal load indicates the normal aircraft
capacity, excluding ferry tanks. Reference numbers are to notes at the end of this section.
NOTE: Fuel grades are for planning purposes only. This publication does not constitute
authority to use a grade of fuel other than specified for a particular aircraft. Official aircraft
consumption factors are prescribed in AFI 65-503, U.S. Air Force Cost and Planning Factors,
Table A13-1, Aviation Fuels Consumption Factors (updated annually). The below numbers are
general planning factors at best. For a more comprehensive list of aircraft sortie rates and fuel
loads please use the Wartime Aircraft Activity (WAA) and the War and Mobilization Plan Vol 5
(WMP-5).

     inch wide 463L pallet. UTC - JFABF (2 personnel), JFDEY (Equipment One ABFDS
     w/ACE), JFDEW (Equipment One ABFDS).
     A9.1.1.10. Platform Size - 88L x 108W x 30H Shipping Weight = 6400 lbs.
     A9.1.1.11. Operation and Installation -
        A9.1.1.11.1. Two AFSC 2F0X1 Special Experience Identifier (SEI) 369 qualified
        ABFDS operators are required for operation of the ABFDS or ABFDS with ACE.
        The aerial fuel delivery standard configuration utilizes all pallet positions inside the
        aircraft cargo compartment, to include the ramp position. The number of fuel
        bladders may be reduced due to mission requirements. The pump module must be
        located on the aft ramp during engine operation to permit engine exhaust hoses to
        extend outboard of the cargo compartment.
        A9.1.1.11.2. Some ABFDS have been modified with Alternate ACE to provide a
        capability to refuel aircraft direct from the ABFDS. Commanders may authorize the
        one-time use of non-ACE equipped ABFDS for aircraft servicing when an emergency
 70                                                          AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013


          situation develops and support cannot be provided by other means. Under these
          circumstances, it must again be remembered that the normal ABFDS has no filter
          separator capability.
          A9.1.1.11.3. Interoperability - The ABFDS is versatile in its capability to interface
          with other equipment. ABFDS can be used for delivery of all grades of jet fuels, Av-
          Gas, diesel or heating fuels, and gasoline. The system can deliver fuel to all other
          services, road tankers, bulk fuel storage systems, and aircraft except the UH-1 and
          OH-58 helicopters. Advance notice is required for US Air Force to obtain the CCR
          nozzle or open port nozzle for refueling the UH-1 and OH-58 helicopters. The
          ABFDS can also receive fuel from the USA Fuel System Supply Point (FSSP),
          Tactical Airfield Fuel Dispensing System (TAFDS), and all road tankers.
   A9.1.2. FORCE
       A9.1.2.1. Primary Function - Fuel receipt, bulk fuel storage, and transfer, truck fillstand
       and aircraft refueling system.
       A9.1.2.2. FORCE is comprised of three distinct UTCs: JFDFS, JFDRC, and JFDSC
       (See Attachment 8).
       A9.1.2.3. Description - When used in conjunction with fabric fuel bladders, it provides a
       deployable, above-ground, constant pressure, flow on demand fueling system for aircraft,
       i.e., a Type III hydrant fueling system. A typical equipment arrangement to perform the
       hydrant mission uses three R-18s (Pumping Unit), three R-19s (Filter Separator Unit),
       three R-20s (Servicing Platform), and hoses, fittings, and components from the R-21
       (Plumbing Assembly) capable of providing up to 2,700 gpm directly to receiver aircraft,
       please note that FORCE does not have a standard foot print. It is all determined by your
       daily fuel requirement and any host nation specific requirements. A single system is
       capable of providing 400,000 gallons per day sustained and up to 1 million gallons a day
       surge capability. The R-18s and R-20s communicate with each other through a wired
       remote control system, and each R-18 and R-20 has a hand-held remote control
       capability, which communicates by wire (tether) with its respective unit. The control
       system is capable of integrating up to ten R-18 Pumping Units and ten R-20 Servicing
       Platforms in a hydrant-type arrangement. Additionally, each FORCE system is equipped
       with a R-18 pump, R-19 filter separator, line strainer, two offloading skids capable of
       receiving from 4 tank trucks simultaneously, meter, hose, and couplings to offload fuel
       from a remote location outside the base perimeter fencing. Lastly, FORCE has one R-18
       designed to transfer fuel from a bulk storage location to operating storage at rates of 900
       GPM or more.
       A9.1.2.4. Tank Capacity - FORCE can be configured with any size and number of
       bladder storage tanks or tied directly into a bulk storage system.
       A9.1.2.5. Pump Capacity - 600 gpm through a single issue nozzle and 900 gpm through
       two issue nozzles (servicing platform), Single Point Refueling 2.5 inch and Open Port 2
       inch issue
A9.1.2.5.1. Couplers (R-18) - one 6 inch male Camlock fitting
          A9.1.2.5.2. Receipt couplers (R-18) - two 6 inch four ear Camlock fittings
AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013                                                                      71


        A9.1.2.5.3. Airlift Data - Is contained in the LOGDET.
     A9.1.2.6. Components and Operation - The R-18 is a pumping system powered by a
     multi-fuel engine capable of moving 900 gpm of jet fuel at an output pressure of 150 psi.
     The pump end is a self- priming centrifugal pump driven by a speed-increasing gear box
     attached to the engine. A pressure relief valve, which is located in a by-pass circuit
     around the pump, ensures that the system pressure is no more than 150 psi and also
     protects the pump from upstream pressure surges. Additionally, the pump is equipped
     with an air eliminator to automatically prevent vapor locks when offloading tank trucks.
     The inlet connections are two six-inch female, four-ear Camlock fittings. The outlet is a
     six-inch male Camlock fitting. An eight-inch basket strainer is upstream of the pump
     impellers to prevent impeller damage. A locking wafer valve is upstream of the basket
     strainer, so that the basket strainer may be isolated for cleaning with minimal draining of
     fuel required. A telescoping hoist provides area lighting from four halogen flood lights.
     The remote control system includes a hand-held controller which can be used to start and
     stop the unit and change the engine rpm from idle to run and back again. The hand-held
     unit can be either tethered or use Radio Frequency depending on the operator’s choice.
     There is also a wired communications capability, so that the R-18 can work in concert
     with other R-18s and R-20s. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are used to control
     the unit’s functions based on communications received from the hand-helds and/or other
     R-18s and R-20s. The trailer-mounted R-20 weighs about 4,600 pounds. The R-19
     consists of two 600 gpm aluminum alloy filter separators, which are fully qualified to the
     requirements of API/IP 1581, Fifth Edition, and configured to run in parallel at 1200 gpm
     or individually at 600 gpm. Each 600 gpm filter separator is qualified to the M100
     requirements with the additional military requirements for reduced effluent-free water
     limit. Each vessel incorporates a peak holding differential pressure gauge and is fitted
     with a pressure relief valve and an air eliminator that have discharge ports connected to a
     sump tank. The sump tank is equipped with an evacuation system that discharges the
     accumulated fuel back into the inlet of the filter separator system. Each filter separator is
     equipped with a two-inch manual water sump drain system. The sumps of each vessel
     are fitted with a float pilot, which shuts down the flow through the vessel when the sump
     reaches a predetermined water level.             Each vessel has a four-inch isolation
     valve/evacuation system so that the filter vessel can be drained and filter elements can be
     changed in either vessel while maintaining flow through the other without having to drain
     any of the fuel to a container. Four-inch inlets to the two filter separators are connected
     by a manifold to a single six-inch inlet having a female, four-ear, Camlock fittings. The
     outlet of each vessel has a control valve that is piloted to - (1) stop the flow in the event
     of a high water level in the vessel’s sump; (2) limit the flow to a maximum of 660 gpm
     through the vessel; and (3) check flow in the reverse direction. The four-inch outlets of
     the two filter separators are connected by a manifold to a single six-inch, male Camlock
     outlet. The trailer mounted R-19 weighs about 3,000 pounds. The R-20 supplies up to
     900 gpm of fuel to two aircraft and limits nozzle pressure to 50/or 35 +/- 5 psi. The fuel
     inlet to the platform is a six-inch, four-ear, female Camlock. A 1-micron filter, which is
     rated for 1000 gpm, provides the final filtering of the fuel before it enters the aircraft.
     The outlet of the filter vessel is connected to a six-inch control valve that limits the
     maximum flow through the system to 1000 gpm under any conditions. This valve also
     controls flow through a fluid motor generator, which charges the batteries when fuel is
72                                                          AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013


     flowing. Fuel flow is separated through a manifold into two separate circuits capable of
     providing up to 600 GPM individually through one hose or 900 GPM through two hoses,
     each with its own positive displacement flow meter, pressure and flow control system,
     automated data capture (ADC) for collection of billing data and discharge hose and reel.
     Electrically operated hose reels with 60 feet of 2.5” API 1529 hose are provided for each
     circuit to provide hot pit refueling capability. For fueling of wide body aircraft, two 120-
     foot lengths of collapsible 3” hose are stored on manually operated reels and again can
     refuel through one hose at 600 GPM or two hoses at 900 GPM. The remote control
     system includes a hand-held controller (tethered or RF), which is used to open and close
     the fueling valves. There is also a wired communications capability, so that the R-20 can
     work in concert with other R-18s and R-20s. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are
     used to control the unit’s functions based on communications received from the hand-
     helds and/or other R-18s and R-20s. The trailer-mounted R-20 weighs about 4,000
     pounds.
     A9.1.2.7. Interoperability - FORCE, in addition to supporting all US Air Force aircraft,
     can refuel all other services/NATO aircraft using the SPR or open port nozzle. The
     FORCE system can also receive from and issue fuel to all US Army, US Marine Corps
     and NATO road tankers/pipeline systems. There is also 8 bolt 6” ANSI flange to
     Camlock connections to allow the system to be used with fixed facilities having an 8 bolt
     6” ANSI flange. The system also has two fillstand skids to allow the fill of refueling
     vehicles at 50PSI and 600 GPM.
     A9.1.2.8. A Mission Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) is available for FORCE.
     A9.1.2.9. Refer to AFI 25-101 for FORCE storage/maintenance requirements.
  A9.1.3. R-14 Air Transportable Hydrant Refueling System (ATHRS)
     A9.1.3.1. Primary Function - Aircraft refueling. Alternate Function includes Aircraft
     defuel and unit fillstand.
     A9.1.3.2. Description - The R-14 ATHRS has a multi-fuel diesel engine, filter separator,
     pressure controls, hoses, nozzles, and adaptors to create a self-contained aircraft refueling
     system. Manufacturer - Entwistle, NSN - 4930-00-112-2432, T.O. 37A9-3-5-1/21. The
     R-14 ATHRS is not equipped with two 50,000 gallon standard fuel bladders, units must
     request additional bladder support if needed.
     A9.1.3.3. Tank Capacity - 100,000 gallons in normal configuration. The R-14 can be
     configured with any size and number (usually two) of bladder storage tanks or tied
     directly into a bulk storage system.
     A9.1.3.4. Pump Capacity - 600 GPM
     A9.1.3.5. Issue Nozzle - Single Point Refueling 2.5 inch
     A9.1.3.6. Issue KAM-LOK Couplers - 4 inch male, 3 inch female.
     A9.1.3.7. Receipt KAM-LOK Couplers - 4 inch male, 4 inch female, 3 inch female.
     A9.1.3.8. Airlift Data - UTC - JFDEG, Shipping Weight - 10,960 lbs., Cubic Feet - 773,
     Overall Dimensions - 156L x 87W x 83-102H.
AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013                                                                       73


     A9.1.3.9. Operation and Installation - A diked area 80 by 80 feet for bladders
     manufactured before 2008 and a diked area 85 x 85 feet for bladders manufactured after
     2008 with an interior sand surface area is required to prevent bladder puncture and
     spreading of fuel to the parking apron. The dike should be a minimum of 3.5 feet high at
     the lowest point to prevent fuel migration. The dike forward area must be within 250 feet
     of the receiving aircraft refueling adaptor to permit installation and aircraft refueling with
     available hose sections. For more information on building a proper dike area please refer
     to T.O. 37A12-15-1. Fuel is normally offloaded into the bladders by use of a 600 GPM
     type A/M 32, R-22 pump and a type FFU-15E 600 GPM filter separator. Eighty feet of 4
     inch KAM-LOK hose sections and isolation valves are supplied with the A/M 32 R-22
     pump. If the R-14 is configured to be tied into an existing storage system, caution must
     be exercised to ensure adequate safety precautions are included; i.e., a pumping unit (R-
     22), pressure relief valve, and isolation valves are installed between the storage system
     and the R-14 unit. When requesting R-14 systems, keep in mind the R-14 is sometimes
     described as being complete with two bladder tanks in the slings, while at other times the

AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013                                                                       79


     Fabric tanks are tested from - 40 degrees Fahrenheit to 160 degrees Fahrenheit to prove
     reliability in any climate. Tanks can be manifolded together and are repairable in the
     field. Ref: T.O. 3712-15-1, Chapter 1.4.3.
     A9.1.13.2. Considerations - If plans are to use bladders, a suitable site must be selected.
     Overall area should be approximately 100 feet wide by 100 feet long for an R-14 system,
     be free of rocks and obstructions, and provide adequate drainage. Dike should be placed
     as close to the aircraft apron as practically possible. The ground should be as level as
     possible with maximum slope of three degrees to prevent the tank from creeping or
     crawling. Avoid low areas to prevent accumulation of trapped vapors. Careful attention
     should be given to receiving capabilities, such as rail cars, taxiways, and roads. If the site
     is dependent on Aerial Bulk Fuel Delivery System for resupply, the tank area must be
     placed 100 feet from a parking apron. Do not place the site uphill or upstream from other
     installations because of possible contamination or fires due to bladder rupture. Where
     possible, a dike or berm should be constructed with a capacity of at least 1 ½ times the
     capacity of the tanks within. Collapsible tanks have also been approved for storage of
     special fuels (JPTS) with precautions outlined in this pamphlet.

  A9.1.14. SEAL DRUMS
     A9.1.14.1. Description - Seal Drums are collapsible rubber, non-vented containers for
     transporting and storing fuel. Drums are available in 55 or 500 gallon capacities. Drums
     are constructed of 4 ply tire cord and are equipped with swivel plates and anchor shackles
     at both ends which allow tie down aboard aircraft, and ground towing (rolling) using a
     special lifting and towing yoke. Internal tanks are equipped with fuel/defuel valves and
     are complete with external fuel servicing adapters.
     A9.1.14.2. Considerations - Drums are filled and emptied through an elbow coupler
     valve and check valve adapter in the front closure plate. Field repair kits are available.
     Because drums are non-vented, they must be kept shaded to prevent fuel expansion and
     drum rupture. Below 20 degrees Fahrenheit the drum becomes brittle.

  A9.1.15. HOSE CARTS
     A9.1.15.1. Description - MH-2 series hose carts are trailer mounted units designed for
     transfer of fuel between fixed hydrant system outlets and single-point refueling
     receptacles on aircraft. Carts are equipped with a filter separator, meter, flow control
     capability and inlet/outlet hoses. Carts do not have pumping capability. Carts can also
     be used to provide filter/meter capability for filling refueling units from hydrant systems,
     for bare-base refueling using bladder storage, and R-22 pumping systems; and as a
     substitute for the FFU-15 filter separator. The UTC for hose carts is JFZ99.
     A9.1.15.2. Considerations - While all hose carts use standardized single-point refueling
     nozzles, the hydrant quick-coupler valve (moose head) that connects into the installed
     hydrant outlet on the aircraft parking differs, dependent on the type of hydrant outlet
     connector in use at an airfield. This is an obvious concern when intending to use Air
     Force supplied hose carts on a host airfield. Use of a hose cart in conjunction with an R-
     22 pumping system requires removal of the hydrant quick-coupler valve and replacement
     with a 4 inch KAM-LOK coupler.

     A9.2.5.3. Operation and Installation - The tactical petroleum terminal (TPT) is a fuel
     storage and handling system which serves as a base, intermediate, or head terminal in an
     undeveloped theater and may be used in the developed theater to supplement existing
     facilities that are inadequate or damaged. The TPT can store up to 30,000 barrels of fuel
     in each of its three fuel units. Each fuel unit is normally dedicated to mogas, diesel fuel,
     and jet fuel. Fuel can be received from a pipeline or from tank vehicles. The TPT can
     dispense fuel directly to user vehicles or to bulk fuel transport vehicles. It can also return
     fuel to the pipeline for distribution downstream. The system can receive fuel at rates up
     to 800 GPM. The major components which make up the TPT include - Eighteen-BFTA's
     with a capacity of 5,000 barrels each; ten-50,000 gallon collapsible tanks; a 350 GPM
     pump; six-350 GPM filter separators; fifteen 600 GPM hose line pumps (6 inch);
     nineteen fire suppression systems; 42,000 feet of hose; a beach interface unit; and
     associated valves and manifolds.
     A9.2.5.4. Interoperability - The TPT (as a terminal) would normally receive fuel from
     the Navy's Offshore Petroleum Distribution System (6-inch flexible steel pipe). The TPT
     can also receive and issue fuel to and from USMC tank trucks and hose lines, and the
     ABFDS, but cannot receive fuel from USAF aircraft via wet wing defueling without a
     SPR nozzle with KAM-LOK couplings. The same nozzle is required to transfer fuel

A9.4. Marine Corps Tactical Fuel Systems. Marine Corps bulk fuel equipment has to meet a
wide spectrum of requirements from ship-to-shore operations to aircraft refueling. To meet these
requirements, the Marine Corps has developed a family of Tactical Fuel System (TFS). Each
system is designed and configured specifically to support a unique mission using similar
components. The ability to alter fundamental system configurations and interchangeability of
components allows the creation of limitless combinations of tailored systems to meet mission
requirements.
   A9.4.1. Amphibious Assault Fuel System (AAFS). The Amphibious Assault Fuel System
   (AAFS) (USMC TAMCN B0685) is the largest of the Marine Corps TFS. Consisting of
   many self-contained units, the AAFS is used to receive, store, transfer, and dispense. The
   AAFS supplies bulk fuel to all elements of a MAGTF including distribution by hoseline to
   Forward Operating Bases and airfields. The system can receive fuel from offshore vessels,
   railcars, tank trucks, bulk storage tanks, pipeline/hoseline, and drums. Fuel is stored and can
   be transferred to another storage site or dispensed to individual containers, vehicles, tank
   trucks, and other fuel systems.
       A9.4.1.1. Composition. Six assemblies make up the AAFS:
           A9.4.1.1.1. Beach Unloading Assembly
           A9.4.1.1.2. Receiving Assembly
           A9.4.1.1.3. Booster Pump assemblies, with one Hose Reel System (HRS)
           A9.4.1.1.4. Two Fuel Adapting Assemblies
           A9.4.1.1.5. Two Fuel Dispensing Assemblies
AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013                                                                   93


         A9.4.1.1.6. Five Tank Farm Assemblies       Each AAFS has one Beach Unloading
         assembly used for receiving fuel during ship-to-shore operations. The two Booster
         Pump assemblies in each AAFS are used when the distance between the Beach
         Unloading assembly and the Tank Farm storage sites are greater than the pumping
         distance allows. The AAFS storage capacity comes from the five tank farms. One
         Fuel Receiving assembly in each AAFS provides the capability to defuel 55-gallon
         drums. Two Fuel Dispensing assemblies in each AAFS provide the capability to
         dispense fuel. The AAFS has two Fuel Adapting assemblies to make the system
         compatible with commercial and other Services' fuel systems. Versatility is an
         important part of the AAFS. It can be deployed as a whole or tailored to meet
         mission requirements. However, each AAFS may contain only one type of fuel.
     A9.4.1.2. Capacity. The AAFS storage capacity is 1,120,000 gallons made up from its
     six tank farms. The AAFS has approximately 5 miles of 6-inch hose and uses seventeen
     600-gallons per minute (gpm) pumps. Using quick-connect, Camlock fittings, the AAFS
     can be assembled without tools and is compatible with all the other Marine Corps TFS.
  A9.4.2. Tactical Airfield Fuel Dispensing System (TAFDS). Similar in design to the
  AAFS tank farm, the Tactical Airfield Fuel Dispensing System (TAFDS) (USMC TAMCN
  B0675) is used to provide bulk fuel receipt, storage and aircraft refueling capabilities in
  support of Marine Corps Expeditionary Airfields (EAF) and Forward Operating Bases
  (FOB). The primary purpose of the TAFDS is aircraft refueling. This system is air-
  transportable, versatile and can be quickly assembled without special tools. Compatible with
  all other Marine Corps TFSs, the TAFDS can receive fuel from almost any source with the
  appropriate adapters. Fifty-five gallon drums may be defueled using the drum unloading
  portion of the TAFDS. This system is used for receiving, storing, transferring, and
  dispensing aviation fuel in support of expeditionary airfields. With the single fuel on the
  battlefield concept, the TAFDS will be able to supply aviation and ground fuel for airfields.
  The TAFDS consists of six 20,000-gallon collapsible tanks and four 50,000 gallon tanks for a
  storage capacity of 320,000 gallons. Each TAFDS rates seven pumps of either 350 or 600
  gpm. With its designed pumping rate and equipment to set up 12 dispensing points, the
  TAFDS has a multi-plane fueling capability. The TAFDS may also be used to replenish tank
  vehicles. Filtration of the fuel to meet Naval aviation fuel requirements are accomplished
  using filter separators and fuel monitors. The TAFDS can be used for either hot or cold
  aircraft refueling.
  A9.4.3. Helicopter Expedient Refueling System (HERS). The Helicopter Expedient
  Refueling System (HERS) (USMC TAMCN B1135) is designed for refueling attack
  helicopters in support of operations in advanced or remote locations. It is normally used at
  Forward Arming and Refueling Points (FARPs). Versatility, easily transportable, and rapid
  deployment are key elements of the HERS. Equipped with 2-inch hoses and adapters, the
  HERS is compatible with other Marine Corps TFSs. The HERS has a maximum capacity of
  18,000 gallons from (18) 500-gallon collapsible drums and (3) 3,000-gallon tanks. The
  HERS has four 125 gpm pumps and enough components to set up four refueling points. It
  may be deployed as a whole or in part to meet operational requirements. Due to its limited
  storage capacity and flow rate (100 gpm), the HERS is ideally suited for attack and utility

  A9.4.4. Expedient Refueling System (ERS). The Expedient Refueling System (ERS)
  (USMC TAMCN B1570) is designed for expedient refueling support of ground equipment
  and is used in conjunction with TFS storage containers such as the 500 gallon collapsible
  drum or 3000 gallon collapsible fabric fuel tank. Easily transportable and highly mobile are
  key elements of the ERS. It consists of either a 100 or 125 gpm pump and with hoses and
  components for two refueling points. All components within the ERS have 2-inch couplings.
  The ERS does not have filtration equipment; therefore it is not used for aircraft refueling.
  A9.4.5. SIXCON. The Marine Corps Liquid Storage, Transporting, and Dispensing System,
  is commonly called a SIXCON (6 containers). When configured for administrative shipping
  (empty, no fuel) on cargo ships, six modules can be assembled together with special
  connectors to form a standard 8’ x 8’ x 20’ International Standards Organization (ISO)
  container. SIXCONs are used to store, transport, and dispense fuel from either a static site or
  deployed on tactical medium and heavy lift trucks. Components of the fuel SIXCON system
  are one fuel pump module and five tank modules. The modules form a fuel distribution
  source that can be transported as a unit or individually.
     A9.4.5.1. Fuel Pump Module. The SIXCON fuel pump module (USMC TAMCN
     B1580) consists of a 125 gpm pump, 100 gpm filter separator, 100 gpm fuel quality
     monitor, meter assembly, and hose reel with dispensing capability. The fuel pump was
     designed to dispense fuel for defueling, or for filtering aircraft or ground fuels. The rate
     of transfer for the SIXCON pump module is up to 100 gpm.
     A9.4.5.2. Fuel Tank Modules. Each SIXCON fuel tank module (USMC TAMCN
     B2085) is made of stainless steel and has a capacity of 900 gallons. The fuel tank is
     equipped with all the hoses and adapters to connect the tanks to the pump unit.
     A9.4.5.3. Accessories. SIXCON modules are interconnected using special horizontal
     and vertical ISO connectors. Fuel is transferred via 2-inch hoses with dry-break
     couplings. This allows rapid assembly and disassembly without loss of fuel or damage to
     the environment.
     A9.4.5.4. Cyclic Resupply - SIXCON modules are assigned to general Combat Service
     Support (CSS) organizations. These organizations may implement a cyclic resupply
     procedure where modules are exchanged for empty ones. SIXCONs may also be
     assigned to using organizations for minimal fuel handling at the operator level.
  A9.4.6. M970 Mobile Refueler (Marine Corps). The M970, 5,000-gallon mobile refueler
  (USMC TAMCN D0215) provides aircraft refueling/defueling and limited over-the-road
  transportation of bulk fuel. It is assigned to both the Aviation Combat Element (ACE) and
  the Combat Service Support Element (CSSE). Within the ACE, the M970 is organic to the
  Fuel Division within the Marine Wing Support Squadron (MWSS) and is used primarily to
  refuel aircraft. Within the CSSE, the M970 is organic to the motor Transport Support
  Battalion (TSB). The CSSE uses the M970 to transport bulk fuel between storage sites or
  directly to the EAFs/FOBs.
  A9.4.7. Tactical Petroleum Laboratory-Medium (TPLM). The Tactical Petroleum
  Laboratory-Medium (TPLM) (TAMCN B0695) provides the essential testing components
  integrated into an ISO sized container to monitor the critical physical and chemical
  characteristics of aviation and ground fuels. JP-4, JP-5, JP-8, diesel, and their commercial
AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013                                                                        95


  grade equivalents can be tested for composition and quality against minimum standards as
  specified in MIL-STD-3004B, Quality Assurance/Surveillance for Fuels, Lubricants and
  Related Products. The TPLM can also test captured fuels.
  A9.4.8. USMC Aircraft Bulk Fuel Handling Systems. Air-to-air refueling or transfer of
  bulk aviation fuel can both extend the range of aircraft and provide a means for the MAGTF
  to "air deliver" jet fuel to forward operating sites. Table 1-1-1 is a listing of I/II MEF bulk
  fuel equipment. USMC KC-130R Transport. The primary mission of the KC-130 Transport
  is air-to-air refueling. It can air-to-air refuel both tactical Marine fixed wing aircraft and CH-
  53 helicopters. The KC-130R can also land at distant airfields with an internal load carrying
  up to 10,000 gallons of jet fuel.
  A9.4.9. Tactical Bulk Fuel Distribution System (TBFDS). The TBFDS consists of fuel
  range extension tanks, hoses, and couplings that can be loaded internally on a CH-53
  helicopter. This system can be used to extend the operating range of the CH-53 or allow for
  helicopter delivery of fuel to distant forward areas. The TBFDS configured CH-53 can either
  re-supply or refuel aircraft at FARPs.
  A9.4.10. Hose Reel System (HRS). The major components of the HRS are two base units,
  eleven reel units, two power units, and a control pendant. Each reel has four sections of 600-
  feet long lightweight 6-inch diameter collapsible hose (total of 2400-feet per reel or five
  miles of hose per system) with split clamp couplers at each end. The HRS is also equipped
  with reducer adapters and 3-way WYE fittings for splitting directions from a main line to or
  from a tank farm assembly and various flange and straight adapters for interfacing with
  Camlock hoses. The Hose Reel System used to connect assemblies within the AAFS and
  distribute fuel to a forward operating location and other tactical fuel systems. Each AAFS
  has an HRS coupled with the two booster pump assemblies to provide the hose line transfer
  capabilities. The HRS is an electrically powered spooling apparatus utilized to deploy and
  retrieve collapsible 6-inch diameter fuel hose from a reel. The HRS is designed to mount on
  the bed of a medium or heavy tactical motor transport vehicle and draw electrical power from
  the vehicle’s electrical system through a slave receptacle to operate the HRS’s power base.
  The power base has two electric motors, each with a reduction gearbox to drive two rollers
  mounted at the front of the HRS base frame to deploy the 6-inch hose line. The hose can be
  deployed at an average of 2 Miles Per Hour (MPH) and retrieved at 0.5 MPH.

                   CONTINGENCY LOCATION SET-UP CHECKLIST

A10.1. When configuring a fuels system layout, no standard configuration can be established
because layout is governed by the nature of the terrain, location of existing roadways, taxiways,
parking ramps, runways, perimeter fences, host nation capabilities and wishes as well as other
factors.
   A10.1.1. A detailed study of the airfield must be made and all details considered before
   beginning construction of tactical fuel systems. Burning JP-8 generates temperatures in
   excess of 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Once a fire has started in a bladder farm, it is
   unstoppable with limited deployed firefighting equipment and will destroy all adjacent
   bladders by melting and flashing over. Due to the threat of fire, divide the location’s total
   inventory objective by three, and create separate bermed storage areas with a minimum of
   300 feet separation to prevent the uncontrollable spread of fire and total loss of the fuel
   inventory.
   A10.1.2. When determining the optimum layout for fuels operations, these questions may
   assist in selecting the “best” layout and location(s) of elements. The construction of four
   major contingency fuels areas must be considered.
A10.2. Perimeter fence line receiving area (Forward Receiving Area or “FRF”)
   A10.2.1. Perimeter fence line receiving area (Forward Receiving Area or “FRF”). The
   Kobar Towers bombing demonstrated the willingness and ability of terrorists to use
   commercial fuel trucks as weapons. A perimeter receiving area or “FRF” maximizes the
   efficiency of available commercial tank truck resources by minimizing turnaround times.
   Coordinate with Security Forces personnel to determine these requirements.
   A10.2.2. What is the security posture (threat) at the operating location? Will the threat
   require construction of a FRF to maximize the speed and efficiency of tank truck receipt
   operations?
   A10.2.3. Does the host nation receive fuel by pipeline? If so, is it a sufficient rate to support
   both host nation and USAF fuels operations? If so, is there a way to modify the host nation
   facility to allow receiving into bladders from a fixed tank, transfer line, extended fill stand
   hose, etc.
   A10.2.4. Is there a road suitable for commercial tank truck use adjacent to the perimeter
   fence?
   A10.2.5. Will the host nation allow a FRF and transfer hose lines to be installed?
   A10.2.6. Will the terrain and existing facilities allow running a hose line from the perimeter
   to the selected interim storage area?
   A10.2.7. Is there ample room for each grade of fuel to have a separate off-loading/fueling
   area?
A10.2.8. Are there roads to cross, or populated areas to traverse with hose line?
   A10.2.9. Does the site provide cover to minimize the danger of enemy observation and
   attack?
AFPAM23-221 11 MARCH 2013                                                                       97


A10.3. Main storage area (Interim).
   A10.3.1. How many grades of fuel are needed and what quantities of each is to be stored?
   A10.3.2. Is the site reasonably level and well drained to prevent water damage?
   A10.3.3. Can the berm sites be leveled to have a slope of less than three degrees to prevent
   bladder creeping?
   A10.3.4. Avoid low areas to prevent danger of vapor collection.
   A10.3.5. Do not place the site within 100 feet of an existing structure.
   A10.3.6. Do not place the storage area near high value assets such as radar sites,
   communication sites or population centers that are vulnerable to enemy action.
   A10.3.7. Is there easy access to flight line from proposed storage location? i.e., paved roads
   A10.3.8. Is the area free of through traffic?
   A10.3.9. Are there roads to cross, or populated areas to traverse with hose line to get to the
   operating storage area?
A10.4. Operating storage.
   A10.4.1. How will aircraft be primarily refueled, by hot pits, cold pits or both?
   A10.4.2. How will refueling units be used?
   A10.4.3. Is there an existing structure within 100 feet?
   A10.4.4. If using FORCE pumps and servicing platforms, are there roads to cross, or
   populated areas to traverse with hose line to get to the flight line area?
   A10.4.5. Is storage area near high value assets such as radar sites, communication sites or
   population centers that are vulnerable to enemy action?
   A10.4.6. Does this area require major improvements before operations? i.e., roads or
   excessive leveling
   A10.4.7. Is there easy access to flight line for refueling vehicles from proposed storage
   location? i.e., paved roads
   A10.4.8. Is the area free of through traffic?
   A10.4.9. Is the site reasonably level and well drained to prevent water damage?
A10.5. Flight line Dispensing Area.
   A10.5.1. Are there suitable areas for hot/cold pits on parking ramps or taxiways?
   A10.5.2. Have the maintenance and operations squadrons been involved with/approved the
   refueling concept?
   A10.5.3. Will proposed location of FSE items interfere with the other flightline traffic or
   activity?
