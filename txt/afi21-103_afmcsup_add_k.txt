This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance, AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
Equipment Maintenance Management, and AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and
Utilization Reporting. It establishes policy and assigns responsibility to provide AFMC Test
Fleet aircraft status changes/updates in accordance with (IAW) current maintenance conditions
and the developed MDS specific mission essential subsystem list (MESL). This instruction
applies to all AFMC organizations that manage or perform maintenance on AFMC
owned/possessed aircraft regardless of Air Force Specialty Code. Ensure that all records created
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Send comments and
suggested improvements to this instruction on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication, to HQ AFMC/A4MM, 462 Chidlaw Road, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5006.

These MESLs complement AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting.
They apply to maintenance activities supporting AFMC test missions across AFMC.

1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW 21-103. MESLs lay the ground
work for reporting the status of assigned/possessed AFMC test fleet aircraft and equipment
 2                             AFI21-103_AFMCSUP_ADDENDUM_K 19 OCTOBER 2011


supporting AFMC test missions. They list the minimum essential systems and subsystems that
must work on test fleet aircraft to perform specifically assigned unit test, training or other
missions.
1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define system exceptions and help explain complex degraded
mission systems.
1.2. It is understood that any aircraft or support equipment system or subsystem may be
subjected to test or tested under a test scenario and/or are test dependent as directed by the test
mission director. If identified by test mission director, those systems or subsystems if not
already identified by qualifying notes must be operational to be considered FMC or PMC for that
mission.
2. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by WUC or UNS
column (column 2) against the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List
(BSLs) across the page (DTE - Developmental Test and Evaluation, DTS - Developmental Test
Support, TNG - Training). Each unitâ€™s Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement
determines applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft or equipment MESLs incorporate all
AFMC assigned/possessed aircraft/equipment and therefore it is important to compare only the
columns listed in the MESL which are applicable to the units assigned/possessed aircraft. For
example, units with training (TF) coded aircraft would determine report status using only the
FSL and TNG columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is reported using
the MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft/equipment assignment code or type
mission being flown.

QUALIFYING NOTES:
1. Test dependent. As determined by test director based on mission objectives.
2. Warning light, latching mechanisms, and locking system must be operational for pressurized
flight.
3. One oil quantity gauge can be inoperative provided the oil quantity is verified prior to flight
and the low oil quantity light is operational.
4. If inoperative, all four oil quantity gauges must be operational.
5. Oil cooler flaps may be inoperative if the flap can be manually positioned to open and fixed
and oil temperature can be maintained within normal limits.
6. If the ATM, ATM generator, or APU fails, flight in visual meteorological conditions (VMC)
is authorized provided no other electrical malfunctions exist. If the APU generator is
inoperative, the generator will be removed and padded prior to operation of the APU.
7. Propeller may be operated with a feather override failure where the override button fails to
pop out at full feather, (faulty pressure switch) provided maintenance instructions in the
applicable fault isolation manual are followed and no other system is affected.
8. a. Pressurization and both air conditioning systems must be operational for special weapons
mission. b. Pressurization and both air conditioning systems are normally essential if passengers
are carried. If a system fails, flight to a destination with repair capability may be accomplished.
Passengers will be briefed on the possibility that discomfort may be encountered. c. Air
Conditioning and pressurization are not required for low-level missions if a reasonable
temperature can be maintained.
9. Automatic system may be inoperative provided manual temperature control can be
maintained.

10. a. Automatic controller may be inoperative for pressurized flight provided the manual
controller is operative. b. May be inoperative for unpressurized flight.
11. Blade de-icing will be operational for flight into known or forecast icing conditions.
12. May be inoperative for flights that do not require radar.
13. The #1 BSU must be operational.
14. One essential TR unit may be inoperative for flight to a repair facility provided no other
electrical malfunctions exist.
15. All associated equipment and indicators will be operational for each operative engine-driven
generator (i.e., generator control panel, GCU, voltage regulator, generator out/caution light, AC
load meter, etc)
16. For night operations, the left and right wingtip navigation lights must be operational in
addition to one of the white lights on the tail cone.
17. Not required for daylight operations. Two lights per wing will be operational for night
formation flights
18. One may be inoperative provided the taxi light on the same side is operational.
19. One may be inoperative provided the landing light on the same side is operational.
20. All edge "peanut" lighting or backlit lighting will be operational for night operations for the
following instruments; airspeed, altimeters, VVI/VSI, ADI, and HSI.
21. One may be inoperative.
22. One per tank required if tank contains fuel.
23. One main fuel tank indicator may be inoperative provided: a. Both the tank with the
inoperative indicator and its symmetrical tank quantity are verified by use of a fuel tank dipstick.
b. At enroute stops when engines are shut down, the tank with the inoperative indicator and the
symmetrically opposite tank will be dip checked. c. Cross feed operation will begin when the
symmetrically opposite quantity indicator has decreased to 1,500 lbs (inboards) and 2,500 lbs
(outboards). d. Engine-out training using the engine corresponding to the inoperative indicator or
ts symmetrical opposite will not be conducted during tank to engine operation. e. Flights
consisting of multiple stops when the mission profile does not allow dipping of tanks will
terminate with a minimum of 8,000 lbs calculated main tank fuel.
24. Both pilot's altimeters must be operational.
25. Always required if carrying passengers.
26. Two are required.
27. If installed, one must be operational.
28. Required if thunderstorms or hazardous conditions that can be detected by airborne radar are
forecast or exist along route of flight.

29. If equipped with two radars then not required, pilots radar is all that is required for flight if
known or forecast thunderstorms are expected along route of flight or at night.
30. Vertical velocity indication may be inoperative on one indicator except for flights in RVSM
airspace.
