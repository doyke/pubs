SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision updates reference documentation associated with Energy Management and expands
on the responsibilities of personnel who work and live at Kunsan AB.
1. Purpose: This policy will help decrease Kunsan Air Base’s energy consumption in an effort
to meet the energy reduction goals mandated by Executive Order 13423, Strengthening Federal
Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management, and outlined in AFI 90-1701, Energy
Management, for all government facilities. It outlines the responsibilities for energy
conservation in all facilities.

2. Lighting Standards: Lighting standards shall be observed throughout Kunsan AB.
     2.1. Interior Lighting: Facility and dormitory managers must maintain lighting at acceptable
     illumination levels according to 41CFR 102-74.180. In general, this may be accomplished
     by ensuring that facilities comply with the interior lighting levels shown in Table 1.
     Allowable Interior Lighting Levels unless the Base Civil Engineer (BCE) determines that
     special circumstances exist. The 8th Civil Engineer Squadron (8 CES) will evaluate lighting
     levels for energy consumption determinations using a foot-candle meter as well as the
     Illuminance Selection guidelines provided by the IES Lighting Handbook published by the
     Illumination Engineering Society (IES).

Table 1. Allowable Interior Lighting Levels




        2.1.1. Facility Managers will be responsible for turning off all interior lighting in shared
        areas when buildings are unoccupied. Exceptions include lighting required by the 8 CES
        Fire Emergency Services Flight (8 CES/CEF), 8th Fighter Wing Safety (8 FW/SE), and
        8th Security Forces Squadron (8 SFS).
        2.1.2. Hardened Aircraft Shelter (HAS) lighting will be turned off if unoccupied and an
        aircraft is not scheduled to return for maintenance that day.
        2.1.3. Dorm occupants are responsible for ensuring lights are off when they are not in
        their rooms. Dorm managers will document energy waste on dormitory inspection
        sheets.
        2.1.4. Dorm residents are encouraged to use task lighting instead of using overhead
        lights when at their desk, as it uses less energy.
     2.2. Exterior Lighting: When feasible, exterior lighting circuits and fixtures should be
     adjusted (with timers, photocells, etc.) to provide minimal safe lighting dusk to dawn. Give
     consideration to force protection requirements, safety, and facilities supporting 24-hour
     operations. Facility managers are responsible for ensuring exterior lights are off during
     daylight hours.
     2.3. Plug in Loads: Unplug appliances that drain energy even when not in use (i.e. cell
     phone chargers, fans, coffee makers, radios, toasters, game consoles, etc.).
8FWI23-302 6 JUNE 2013                                                                     3


      2.3.1. Dorm residents should ensure all appliances are unplugged when rooms are
      unoccupied. This is particularly important during mid tour leave. Give consideration to
      appliances with standby power modes or when it is not feasible (i.e. alarm clocks,
      refrigerators, etc.).
      2.3.2. In order to prevent mold growth during the summer months; dorm residents may
      leave dehumidifiers plugged in. Dorm residents must ensure they have someone
      checking dehumidifier water levels while they are on leave in order to prevent water
      damage to the room.
3. Temperature Standards: All base activities will observe the minimum and maximum
thermostat temperature standards outlined in Table 2. Minimum and Maximum Temperature
Settings, unless waived by the base energy manager per paragraph 6 in this instruction.

Table 2. Minimum and Maximum Thermostat Settings




   3.1. Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC): HVAC systems are primarily the
   responsibility of 8 CES. Base personnel can give assistance in the area of HVAC problem
   identification. Keep in touch with your surroundings and report HVAC systems that are
   running inefficiently to your facility manager.
      3.1.1. Examples of improper or inefficient HVAC use include:
          3.1.1.1. Reliance on computers and other heat radiating office equipment running 24
          hours a day in the winter in order to keep a room from getting too cool; this is an
          energy conservation situation which should be reported immediately for
          improvement.
          3.1.1.2. Opening doors and windows to control the temperature of an area when the
          HVAC is running. Personnel should report problems to their facility or dormitory
          manager who will have 8 CES adjust the HVAC settings.
      3.1.2. Close all windows and doors when air conditioners, heaters, or collective
      protection systems are on.
 4                                                                    8FWI23-302 6 JUNE 2013


        3.1.3. Turn off air conditioners in large administrative facilities during non-duty hours
        1800-0700 with the exception of mission critical facilities. 8 CES/CEOIH will install
        timers where feasible.
     3.2. Personal Fans: The use of personal fans is encouraged if maintaining proper summer
     thermostat settings of 78°F. The quality-of-life benefit provided by use of fans outweighs the
     minor increase in electrical consumption if maintaining proper thermostat settings.
     3.3. Air Diffusers: Building occupants will not adjust air diffusers or block them with paper,
     cardboard, or other materials. When a diffuser problem occurs, the closure of the diffuser
     may temporarily solve the problem, but it creates a chain reaction that results in an
     unbalanced air system. The unbalanced air system can waste energy since the air
     conditioning may be required to run longer in order to provide comfort to the unbalanced
     areas. Occupants should notify the facility manager or dorm manager to submit a work order
     request.
     3.4. Space Heaters: The use of space heaters should be strictly limited due to high-energy
     costs and safety concerns. Submit requests for space heaters to the facility or dormitory
     manager.
        3.4.1. All space heaters must be UL listed or FM approved. Use space heaters in
        accordance to the manufacturer recommendations and do not leave them unattended. Safe
        use of the space heater will be the responsibility of the user.
        3.4.2. The use of space heaters will generally be approved for the following reasons:
            3.4.2.1. No other heating source is available.
            3.4.2.2. Existing heating equipment fails to maintain an appropriate temperature.
            (See Table 3.1.)
     3.5. Windows: Dorm rooms and office occupants should take advantage of the placement of
     the sun to keep their areas at comfortable temperatures.
        3.5.1. Summer: Keep rooms cool during the hot summer months by closing window
        shades, drapes, or blinds.
        3.5.2. Winter: Use the sun’s rays to keep room warm by opening window shades,
        drapes, or blinds.
4. Mild Weather Season: During fall and spring, 8 CES will monitor temperatures and turn the
HVAC systems off or on according to the guidelines stated below. The 8 FW/CC can override
these guidelines with the understanding that energy conservation may be impacted. The 8
FW/CC may balance energy use by turning on or off HVAC systems in lodging/domicile
facilities to improve quality of rest while keeping HVAC systems in some work locations on or
off to maintain a similar level of energy conservation.
     4.1. Fall: During late September, October and November, 8 CES will monitor weather
     conditions and turn off air-cooling systems and activate heating systems according to the
     following weather conditions:
        4.1.1. Air-cooling systems off: This will occur after three consecutive days where the
        mean temperature is below 70°F. Historically, when the average daily temperature
8FWI23-302 6 JUNE 2013                                                                        5


      decreases to this temperature for three days, the temperature will remain in a comfortable
      range.
      4.1.2. Heat systems on: This will occur after three consecutive days where the mean
      temperature is below 55°F for dormitory facilities only and after three consecutive days
      of 50 °F for all other facilities on base.
   4.2. Spring: During March, April, May, and June, 8 CES will monitor weather conditions
   and turn off heating systems and activate cooling systems according to the following weather
   conditions:
      4.2.1. Heat systems off: This will occur after three consecutive days where the mean
      temperature is above 50°F for all facilities on base excluding dormitories which will have
      heat turned off after three consecutive days where the mean temperature is above 55 °F.
      Historically, when the average daily temperature increases above this temperature for
      three days, the temperature will remain in a comfortable range.
      4.2.2. Air-cooling systems on: This will occur after three consecutive days where the
      mean temperature is above 70°F and forecast to remain above 70 °F. Table 3. Monthly
      Average Temperatures shows monthly average temperatures that can be expected at
      Kunsan AB.

               Note: This data was taken from the Kunsan Climatology table
               maintained by 8 OSS/OSW. Statistics are based on a Period of
               Record (POR) from Aug 1951 - Sep 2005.

   4.3. Mild Weather Heat/Cool Policy and Quality of Life: Organizational commanders will
   encourage personnel to dress appropriately during periods when indoor temperatures may be
   cool or warm.
      4.3.1. Facility managers will maximize the use of outside air in lieu of air conditioning
      and heating. Facility managers will implement this policy and will have personnel in
 6                                                                   8FWI23-302 6 JUNE 2013


        their building open windows and doors and use fans when the air conditioning is not
        running to keep the facility at a comfortable temperature.
        4.3.2. Facility and dormitory managers will ensure personnel are not opening windows
        and doors to cool the facility in the winter when the heat is running. Facility managers
        will call the 8 CES Customer Service Desk and request for the HVAC shop to adjust the
        temperature of the heater or investigate if the system is off balance.
5. Office Equipment:
     5.1. Computer Hard Drives: Personnel must shut down all programs and log off their
     desktop computers at the end of the duty day. The 8th Communications Squadron (8 CS)
     requires hard drives to remain powered on for maintenance and upgrades.
     5.2. Computer Monitors: Kunsan AB employs a Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC)
     that automatically powers off monitors within 30 minutes or less. On those computers for
     which the SDC is not activated, the user must turn off monitors at the end of the duty day.
        5.2.1. For those computers not utilizing the SDC, screen savers are not to be used, as
        they waste energy. Use an appropriate “screen saver option” to lock the computer for
        communications or operations security.
            5.2.1.1. For those computers not utilizing the SDC, personnel will set their computer
            so the monitor will automatically shut off in ten minutes and the hard drive will
            automatically go into “standby” mode in one hour using “Power Options” under
            “Control Panel.”
            5.2.1.2. Contact the unit Client Support Administrator (CSA) for assistance in setting
            the energy savings options.
     5.3. Copy Machines and Printers: Turn off at the end of the duty day.
     5.4. Miscellaneous Equipment and Appliances: Unplug equipment and appliances that drain
     energy even when not in use (i.e. cell phone chargers, fans, coffee makers, radios, etc).
6. Energy Policy Exemptions: The base energy manager, with the assistance of 8 CES/CEF
and as allowed by paragraph 6.1 below, will approve/disapprove all exemptions to energy policy
that are set out by this instruction only. Organizations must provide documentation supporting
waiver requests (AFI, Operating Instructions, Technical Specifications, etc.).
     6.1. Components of the energy policy mandated by law or Air Force Instruction cannot be
     waived.
     6.2. Requestors will route exemption requests through their facility manager and commander
     to the base energy manager. (Please note paragraph 4.3. prior to submitting requests for
     temperature exemptions.).
     6.3. Exemptions are typically limited to lighting levels and temperature standards:
     Permanent exemptions may be granted for some facilities. The list of facilities permanently
     exempted from the mild season heat/cool policy is attached (See Attachment 2). All other
     facilities must annually resubmit exemption requests.
8FWI23-302 6 JUNE 2013                                                                          7


7. New Facility Design and Construction:
   7.1. All designs for new construction and renovations will comply with the applicable
   portions of the most recent Uniform Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-400-01, Energy
   Conservation.
   7.2. The United States Green Building Council’s (USGBC) “Leadership in Energy and
   Environmental Design” (LEED) Green Building Rating System is a preferred self-assessment
   metric to apply the principles of sustainable development. Kunsan AB shall apply
   sustainable development concepts in the planning, design, construction, environmental
   management, operation, maintenance and disposal of facilities and infrastructure projects,
   consistent with the spirit of the most recent Sustainable Design and Development Policy
   distributed on June 02, 2011 in the memorandum entitled “Air Force Sustainable Design and
   Development (SDD) Implementation Guidance”. Accordingly, LEED criteria shall be
   employed to incorporate sustainable development at Kunsan Air Base.
8. Contractors and other Tenants:
   8.1. Construction contractors are required to participate in the energy conservation program.
   8.2. The government may provide utilities (i.e. water, electricity, natural gas, etc.) to the
   contractor without charge if stated in the Statement of Work/Contract. If utilities are
   provided without charge, the contractor may still be required to provide their plan to turn off
   and conserve utilities, especially during hours when utilities are not being used. Construction
   inspectors must advise contractors of their energy management responsibility and ensure the
   contractors do not waste energy.
   8.3. The Base Civil Engineer reserves the right to require contractors to pay for utilities
   used.
   8.4. This Energy Conservation instruction applies to all permit and out grant license holders
   on Kunsan Air base (i.e. Korean Employee Union ).
9. Government Motor Vehicles (GMVs)
   9.1. The use of GMVs will be in accordance with AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, which
   restricts the use of GMVs for official business.
10. Green Procurement: The reduction of green house gas emissions, which are harmful to the
environment, is a second order effect of reducing energy consumption.           Purchasing
environmentally friendly products also protects the environment.
   10.1. All energy-consuming products shall, when feasible, be either ENERGY STAR
   qualified or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) recommended.
       10.1.1. Preferment to ENERGY STAR qualified or Federal Energy Management
       Program (FEMP) recommended appliances is in accordance with Executive Order 13423.
       10.1.2. These products are in the top 25 percent of energy efficiency in their class.
       Additional details regarding these purchasing requirements can be found at
       www.energystar.gov/products and www.eere.energy.gov/femp/procurement.

    10.2. When feasible, environmentally friendly goods and services should be chosen over
    those that are not. Environmentally friendly goods and services include: Products
    manufactured from recycled and reclaimed materials, bio-based products, energy efficient
    products, alternatives to ozone-depleting substances, substitutes for EPA Priority Chemicals,
    and the purchase of alternative fueled vehicles (AFV), alternative fuels and fuel-efficient
    vehicles.
