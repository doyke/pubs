     instruction.
     1.3.4. Submit a quarterly EM report to 56 CES/CEX; the report shall be used to assign unit
     personnel to EM duties, assign EOC duties, assign UCC duties, document location of
     UCC(s), document EM self-inspections, and track observations or findings with corrective
     actions and estimated completion date(s) (Attachment 3). Reports are due by the 15th day of
     the quarter (15 January, 15 April, 15 July, and 15 October).
