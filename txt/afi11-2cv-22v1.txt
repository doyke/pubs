1.4. Aircrew Training Policy. When formal course attendance is not practical or quotas are not
available, units submit requests for in-unit, secondary method training (SMT) to the
MAJCOM/A3 (May be delegated, but not below NAF/DO). Any changes to formal course
requirements due to local conditions or limitations must be identified in the request and approved
by the MAJCOM/A3T. Any aircrew member who was previously removed from a formal
qualification course for substandard performance is ineligible for a secondary method training
waiver. When suitable formal course training products are not available, units submit locally-
developed training syllabi to their MAJCOM/A3T for approval.
   1.4.1. Secondary Method Training. Attempt to complete SMT within 180 days of training
   start. Aircrew members must complete secondary method training within 300 days from the
   date of their first ground training session or first flight, whichever occurs first. Units will
   notify MAJCOM training office with a description of the difficulty and expected completion
   date when training exceeds 180 days. An extension past 300 days requires MAJCOM/A3
   approval.
       1.4.1.1. Formal School Courseware Requests. For secondary method training, the
       waiver authority (per Table 1.1) will include the appropriate formal school (58 SOW or
       19 SOS) as an addressee on all correspondence and will request that the formal school
       forward applicable courseware to the aircrew member’s unit of assignment. Courseware
       includes but is not limited to; the course syllabus, briefings, Computer Based Training
       (CBT) modules, student and instructor guides, and training guides and grade sheets for
       the student’s training folder. The unit training office will verify the current version is
       used.
       1.4.1.2. Complete all academic, ground, and flight training outlined in the courseware.
       When the courseware is adapted for local use, modify it only if the training is
       incompatible with local training conditions.
       1.4.1.3. MAJCOM-approved differences training may be conducted in unit without a
       waiver.
       1.4.1.4. Units conducting training where a waiver is not required (i.e. complete training
       for restricted AF Form 8, Certicate of Aircrew Qualification, MAJCOM approved
       differences training) will send a request for any applicable courseware through channels
       to MAJCOM training office, with an information copy to the appropriate formal school.
       Include unit point of contact (name, rank, office symbol, and telephone number) and the
       name and rank of the individual who will receive the training.

       1.4.2.3. For Weapons Instructor Course (WIC), prepare training records IAW USAFWS
       guidance.
   1.4.3. Aircrew Training While DNIF. Crewmembers whose status is ―duty not involving
   flying‖ (DNIF) may log ground training events, including simulator training, if the member’s
   physical condition allows. Consult the flight surgeon initiating AF Form 1042, Medical
   Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty, action if the DNIF status includes
   ground training limitations.
   1.4.4. In-flight Supervision. Unless specifically directed, the unit commander determines
   the level of supervision necessary to accomplish required training. If the mission objectives
   include introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, then an
   instructor may be required. The following personnel must be supervised by an instructor
   from a like crew position when performing aircrew duties.
       1.4.4.1. Non-current crewmembers.
       1.4.4.2. Crewmembers in initial, difference, upgrade or requalification flying training.

       Chapter 2 and AFI 11-202, Vol 1.
1.5. Active Duty Service Commitments. Formal training, either primary or secondary method,
conducted per this publication may incur an active duty service commitment per AFI 36-2107,
Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC). Reference AFI 36-2107 for program specifics.
   1.5.1. Enlisted aircrew must either accept an ADSC or attain retainability, as applicable.
   Note: Due to the extended nature of some in-unit upgrades, ADSCs will be effective upon
   completion of the training or 120 days after the first flying event, whichever occurs first.
1.6. Waivers. HQ USAF/A3O-A is the waiver authority for training requirements as specified
in AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, which has delegated this to HQ MAJCOM/A3 for specific aircrew
training events (case by case basis). These requirements currently include initial crew resource
management (CRM) training, initial life support equipment and procedures training, survival,
evasion, resistance, and escape (SERE), flight evaluations, and egress training (see AFI 11-202,
Vol. 1 for specific guidance). For case-by-case individual waivers for flight physical and
physiological training currencies, MAJCOM/SGP and AFMSA/SGPA are the respective waiver
authorities. Some ground training items (e.g. small arms, law of armed conflict (LOAC), etc) are
tasked by other agencies. HQ MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for CV-22-specific Vol 1
aircrew training requirements unless otherwise noted in this publication.

1.8. Intra-command and Inter-command Transfer of Aircrews. For intra-command transfer
of aircrew members, the gaining organization will honor validated training completed by newly
assigned crewmembers prior to the transfer. For inter-command transfer, certifications and
qualifications should be accepted to the maximum extent practical, as long as training and
evaluation standards are equivalent. The operations officer at the gaining unit should review the
individual's career training folder and flight evaluation folder to determine which certifications
and qualifications will be honored. Aircrew members qualified in the same MDS are considered
qualified in that equipment throughout the force when used for the same mission.
   1.8.1. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Screening. Losing units will screen individual
   flight and ground training records during unit out-processing. Accomplish this screening in
   sufficient time to correct discrepancies prior to PCS. Losing unit will provide a printed copy
   of current ground and flying training summaries to individuals prior to PCS. See AFI 11-
   401, Aviation Management, for additional guidance.
   1.8.2. Instructor training and qualifications may be accepted at the discretion of the gaining
   unit commander.
1.9. Initial Cadre for Change of Unit Aircraft, Equipment, or Capability. When possible,

   current crew position and aircraft, total flying time, and requested crew qualification level
   through channels to MAJCOM/A3 for approval.
   1.9.2. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than that most recently
   held, i.e., aircraft commander to flight examiner. Enter appropriate comments in the remarks
   section of the AF Form 8, AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381, explaining the individual’s
   status as initial cadre instructor or flight examiner.
   1.9.3. Following final approval, each converting unit will publish a letter identifying initial
   cadre instructors and flight examiners by aircraft and crew qualification. A copy of this letter
   will be kept on file in each individual's Flight Evaluation Folder.
   1.9.4. Initial cadre is not required for minor aircraft modifications when any required
   training for that modification is provided by the contractor and/or can easily be accomplished
   in-unit. Conduct differences training for the new equipment and log training on the letter of
   Xs or Memo for Record (MFR). Crewmembers will not fly with new equipment until
   trained.
1.10. Unit Aircrew Capability. Squadrons will maintain mission ready status on all primary
aircrew members up to unit authorizations (N/A for AETC and USAFWS instructor aircrew
members). Commanders will train aircrews to meet capabilities specified in unit designed
operational capability (DOC) statements. Supervisory aircrew and staff members assigned above
squadron level, which are in excess of the unit’s mission requirements, will maintain mission

ready, basic mission capable, or basic aircraft qualification status, as required. Note: To change
from BMC to MR status, aircrew will begin maintaining full MR flying currency. The unit
commander may assign additional training, as desired.
   1.10.1. Commanders will not assign additional duties to crewmembers (officer and enlisted)
   for the first 6 months of their initial operational assignment. Unit commanders will avoid
   giving crewmembers on their first special operations assignment, additional duties for the
   first 6 months in the unit.
   1.10.2. Aircrew members will not perform long term duties which detract from the primary
   duties of training for, or performing, the unit flying mission.
   1.10.3. ACC and AETC Currency Requirements. Permanent party aircrew assigned to
   AETC and 14 WPS instructors must maintain at least basic mission capable flying currency
   in the portions of the mission they will instruct. MAJCOM/A3’s may direct specific
   individuals to maintain only partial BMC qualifications. In such cases, the crewmember will
   require only those currency items associated with this tailored qualification. The individual’s
   AF Form 8 will indicate applicable restrictions based on assignments of less than full mission
   qualification. If AETC permanent party and 14 WPS crewmembers augment operational
   units, the gaining unit commander must be provided a detailed list of the individual’s current
   training status. The individual must comply with MR training requirements of the gaining
   unit or pursue applicable waivers through the operational unit’s MAJCOM/A3. The gaining
   unit or MAJCOM may levy additional requirements as desired. Chapter 4 outlines
   exceptions to continuation currency training requirements for these personnel. Note: For the
   purposes of this instruction, enlisted aircrew members assigned to the 14th WPS are not
   considered USAFWS instructors.
1.11. Changes. Recommendations for improvements to this instruction are encouraged. Send
recommendations to HQ AFSOC/A3T, through command channels, on an AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication. AF/A3 is the approval authority for interim
changes to this instruction.
   1.11.1. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP). MAJCOM/A3s may make changes, additions, or
   deletions to the aircrew CT specified in this volume to focus training on capabilities needed
   to accomplish a unit's tasked missions. These changes will be made via RAP tasking memo.
   A MAJCOM RAP tasking message takes precedence over the CT specified in this volume.
   Include HQ AFSOC/A3 as an info addressee on all tasking messages.
1.12. Deviations.
   1.12.1. This publication does not authorize deviations from the flight manual or any other
   Air Force Instruction. Flight safety will be given prime consideration and must take
   precedence over the requirements and guidance of this publication.
1.13. Publication Administration. All aircrew members are authorized this publication. This
publication is available on the epublishing website.
   1.13.1. Supplements. MAJCOMs will coordinate proposed MAJCOM-level supplements to
   this volume through HQ AFSOC/A3TA and HQ USAF/A3O-AT prior to publication. Units
   will coordinate proposed unit level supplements with their MAJCOM training office prior to
   publication.

                                QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. Overview. This chapter outlines the minimum requirements for Basic Aircraft
Qualification (BAQ) which may be completed via initial qualification, requalification,
conversion, or difference training. Duties not directly related to qualification or requalification
training should be minimized.
   2.1.1. Qualification training provides the training necessary to initially qualify crewmembers
   in a basic crew position and flying duties without regard to the unit’s mission. Upon
   completion of qualification training, the crewmember attains BAQ status. BAQ is a
   prerequisite for Mission Qualification Training (MQT, outlined in Chapter 3).
2.2. General Requirements. The primary method of initial qualification for pilots is to attend
the Intermediate Tiltrotor Multi-Service Pilot Training System (MPTS) MV-22 qualification
course and complete CV-22 differences training. The primary method of Initial Qualification
for flight engineers is to attend the CV-22 Mission Flight Engineer initial qualification course.
The primary method of requalification training is the appropriate formal training course listed in
the ETCA. If no requalification course exists, conduct requalification using the initial
qualification course. Exception: Flight Surgeons (FS) and Direct Support Operators (DSO) are
universally qualified and do not require CV-22 specific qualification or requalification.
2.3. Training Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate formal course
syllabus listed in the ETCA and AFI 11-202, Vol. 1. The formal school syllibus of instruction
(SOI) designates the course prerequisite approval authority.
2.4. Ground Training Requirements. All crewmembers must complete ground training
requirements IAW Table 2.1, prior to the first flight. See Chapter 4, Table 4.2 for event
descriptions and applicable notes.

2.5. Flying Training Requirements. Satisfactorily completing the appropriate ETCA formal
course satifies the requirements of this section. Approved in-unit qualification training must be
accomplished IAW applicable formal school courseware and IAW AFI 11-202V1.
2.6. Basic Aircraft Qualification/Difference Training Requirements.
   2.6.1. The MV-22 Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS)
   evaluation administered at Marine Corp Air Station (MCAS) New River during initial
   qualification suffices as the initial BAQ evaluation once differences training is completed.
   As a minimum, differences training will cover USAF IRC differences, basic aircraft systems
   differences, systems interface differences, and USAF procedures differences.
   2.6.2. JVX Application and System Software (JASS), block cycle, and other differences
   training will be coordinated by HQ AFSOC/A3T with supporting agencies.

                     MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT)

3.1. Overview. This chapter establishes the minimum training requirements for completing
initial mission qualification and mission requalification. Upon completion of mission
qualification training, the crewmember will be assigned either Basic Mission Capable (BMC) or
Mission Ready (MR) status.
3.2. General Requirements. The primary method of mission qualification or requalification is
to complete the appropriate formal training course listed in the ETCA. Units may supplement
formal courseware to meet local requirements. Submit all SMT courseware change requests to
AFSOC/A3T prior to implementation.
   3.2.1. Direct Support Operator Training. There is no formal training course for Direct
   Support Operators (DSO), they will complete appropriate in-unit qualification/requalification
   course utilizing HQ AFSOC/A3T approved syllabi and courseware.
3.3. MQT Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate formal course
syllabuslisted in the ETCAand AFI 11-202, Vol. 1. The formal school syllabus designates the
course prerequisite approval authority.
   3.3.1. This does not preclude simultaneous basic qualification and mission qualification
   training. Simultaneous/Concurrent Multiple-MDS qualification upgrades will not be
   accomplished.
   3.3.2. If there is not a separate mission requalification course, aircrew members requalifying
   in the unit’s mission will comply with the initial mission qualification course prerequisites.

                  TRAINING TABLES AND CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General Requirements. The requirements in this section satisfy minimum flying and
related ground requirements established by HQ USAF to maintain currency upon completion of
qualification or requalification training. Individual proficiency may require a greater number of
events to be completed. Commanders will ensure aircrew members receive sufficient
continuation training to maintain individual proficiency.
     4.1.1. Applicability.     Unqualified crewmembers do not log continuation training
     requirements until completion of qualification/requalification. Events completed on a
     satisfactory qualification, mission qualification, requalification evaluation, or certification
     event may be credited toward currency requirements.
4.2. Training Levels. The use of experienced based FTLs allows the squadron commander to
prioritize training resources. Aircrew members must meet the minimum criteria established in
Paragraphs 4.2.1. and Table 4.1. before assignment to the respective training level. When these
minima are met, awarding a training level is at the sole discretion of the squadron commander or
designated representative. Once a semiannual period begins, personnel will not be moved to a
level requiring fewer events until the next semiannual period. Note: The aircrew member’s
availability to fly should not be a factor in assigning training levels (TL).

   4.2.2. Use of Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS). All flying units will
   develop local procedures per AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, as supplemented, to ensure aircrew ground
   and flying training is properly documented and updated. Each unit will provide a printed
   copy of current ground and flying summaries to each individual prior to PCS. ARMS codes
   are annotated in this chapter for reference only. ARMS will track all SERE Training for each
   individual; including training not required for this MDS or Volume.
   4.2.3. Block Training. Block training is the most efficient method of satisfying annual
   ground training requirements and is the preferred method of accomplishment. Courses
   should include all recurring ground training required to maintain readiness (except
   physiological training and physical examinations) for aircrew members assigned or attached
   to active duty units.
4.3. Prorated Training Requirements. See AFI 11-202, Vol. 1 as supplemented.
4.4. Recurrency and Requalification Training.
   4.4.1. Loss of Currency. Aircrew members will receive training under the supervision of an
   instructor when the requirements listed in Tables 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 are not met.
   4.4.2. Loss of Basic Currency. Basic currency is considered those events from Table 4.3
   and the Emergency Procedure Sortie requirement from Table 4.5 of this instruction. Aircrew
   members lacking currency in basic qualification or instrument requirements will fly only in
   training status and under the supervision of an instructor, until currency is regained. They
   will not be used on operational missions until they have regained currency or qualification
   per the requirements of the following paragraphs.
      4.4.2.1. Crewmembers overdue/noncurrent for events up to 6 months will regain
      currency by demonstrating proficiency in the overdue event to an instructor. Events
      performed under the supervision of an instructor can be credited toward monthly,
      quarterly, and semiannual currency requirements.
      4.4.2.2. Crewmembers non-current over 6 months are unqualified in all events. If the
      crewmember is unqualified less than 24 months, unit commander-directed requalification
      training is required. Pilots, as a minimum, will complete the written instrument
      examination, qualification open-book and closed-book examinations, and a
      requalification flight evaluation. Other crewmembers, as a minimum, will complete open
      and closed book examinations, and a requalification flight evaluation. Once requalified,
      training currency events may be prorated per this publication. Previous instructors may
      requalify directly to instructor status.
      4.4.2.3. Crewmembers unqualified from 24 to 60 months must requalify per Chapter 2.
      Requalification may be accomplished in-unit, with an approved waiver for formal school
      attendance. Previous instructors may requalify directly to instructor provided their
      training and evaluations include a review of instructor duties, procedures, and techniques.
      4.4.2.4. Crewmembers unqualified for more than 60 months require all initial
      qualification training requirements and prerequisites per Chapter 2, para 2.2., and
      ETCA. Previous instructors may not qualify directly to instructor status under this
      category.
AFI11-2CV-22V1 27 JANUARY 2011                                                                 25


  4.4.3. Loss of Core/Special Mission and Instructor Certified Event Currency. Failure to
  accomplish mission currency events within the frequency and volume limits specified in
  Tables 4.4 and 4.5 results in a loss of currency for that event. Loss of currency in any core,
  special mission, or instructor certified event item does not affect the individual's basic
  aircraft qualification. Crewmembers non-current in a core, special mission, or instructor
  certified event may perform crew duties and log currency on missions not involving the non-
  current item for up to 6 months.
     4.4.3.1. Crewmembers non-current in core, special mission, or instructor certified events
     up to 6 months require performing those items under the supervision of an instructor in as
     many repetitions as necessary to demonstrate proficiency in each delinquent event.
     Events performed under the supervision of an instructor can be credited toward
     applicable currency requirements.
     4.4.3.2. Crewmembers noncurrent in any core event (see Attachment 2) over 6 months
     are considered unqualified for all mission events (member is restricted from
     accomplishing mission, instructor certified [except functional check flight (FCF)], and
     special mission items unsupervised until requalification). If the crewmember is
     unqualified less than 24 months, unit commander-directed requalification training is
     required. Core requalification training as directed by the unit commander is required. A
     requalification flight evaluation meeting initial mission qualification requirements will be
     performed. Events accomplished during the requalification flight evaluation are
     creditable toward continuation requirements. Previously mission-qualified instructors
     may requalify directly to instructor status in those mission areas previously instructor
     qualified, provided their training and evaluations include a review of instructor duties,
     procedures, and techniques.
     4.4.3.3. Crewmembers unqualified in any core event (see Attachment 2) from 24 to 60
     months are considered unqualified and must requalify by meeting requirements of
     Chapter 3. Requalification may be accomplished in-unit, with an approved waiver. Use
     formal school courseware. Previously qualified instructors may requalify directly to
     instructor status in those areas previously instructor qualified, provided their training and
     evaluations include a review of instructor duties, procedures, and techniques.
     4.4.3.4. Crewmembers unqualified in mission items for more than 60 months are
     considered initial mission qualification candidates. Comply with all initial mission
     qualification training requirements and prerequisites of Chapter 3 and ETCA. Previous
     instructors in this category may not qualify directly to instructor status.
     4.4.3.5. For special mission and instructor certified event qualifications, delinquency in
     any special mission or instructor certification currency requirement does not preclude the
     crewmember from being mission qualified. Non-currency in special mission items for
     more than 6 months renders the individual unqualified for that special mission event. To
     requalify in that special mission, the individual will complete all initial training and
     evaluation requirements for that special mission. For instructor certified events,
     certification is regained by showing proficiency in that event to an instructor. Previously
     qualified instructors may requalify directly to instructor status in special mission or
     instructor certified events, if unqualified for a period less than 60 months.

          4.4.3.5.1. Shipboard Operations. Pilots require recertification if currency is
          exceeded. Flight engineers, if non-current for 6 months or less, may regain currency
          by demonstrating proficiency to an instructor. FEs noncurrent over 6 months require
          recertification. For shipboard operations recurrency, cross-service IPs will be from
          like-MDS (refer to AF/Navy Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)).
4.5. Ground Training Requirements.
   4.5.1. General Information. Table 4.2 designates ground training requirements for all
   aircrew members. Table notes specify which items are considered either grounding, result in
   training status, or are required for mission ready status. Unit commanders may add
   additional training items to meet specific unit requirements. Events are considered current
   until the end of the month in which they are due.

                     with scheduled simulator sorties as directed in table 4.7. Systems
                     refresher training is not required for crew members who will not fly
                     beyond 4 months after their established due date. Satisfactorily
                     completing a formal school basic qualification, requalification, or
                     instructor upgrade course including systems instruction satisfies the
                     refresher course requirement. Crewmembers who are initially qualified
                     or requalified in-unit must attend the refresher course within six
                     months of qualification completion. Waivers: Waiver requests will
                     contain reasoning for not completing within the individual’s eligibility
                     period and proposed alternate means of attaining the training
                     objectives, such as academic review, systems refresher, etc.

Indoctrination       Reference AFI 11-202, Vol 1. Prior to performing unsupervised
                     aircrew duties, crewmembers will complete a unit/theater
                     indoctrination program. This training is a requirement for all newly
                     assigned and TDY aircrew members and will, as a minimum, consist of
                     ground training and a local flight. Each unit will publish a directive
                     outlining specific ground and flight requirements. Design this training
                     to prepare aircrew members for theater operations. This training will:
                     familiarize them with the local flying area and facilities/support
                     agencies available, introduce any theater/mission unique procedures,
                     and review all theater unique instrument requirements. The instrument
                     training portion will include theater unique instrument requirements
                     and procedures, the use of MAJCOM approved non-DOD instrument
                     approach procedures, required instrumentation for specific approaches,

Notes:
1. Table 4.2 event identifiers are for reference only, use identifiers as directed by AF/MAJCOM.
2. Training Codes:
G = Grounding – The crewmember may not perform flight duties with the event not completed.
T = Training status – Individual will only fly in training status (under the supervision of an
instructor in their respective crew position) until training is completed.
M = Mission ready event – Individual will not be used on or deploy for operational missions
until training is completed. Crewmember can fly training missions without instructor
supervision.
N = Non-grounding – The crewmember may perform flight duties with the event not completed
and may maintain MR or BMC status depending on unit commander guidance.

O = Other restrictions – The crewmember may perform flight duties with the event not
completed or overdue under the condition the mission profile does not include the specific event.
3. When training events have an initial and recurring currency, the currency period is listed in
the appropriate order.
4. OSF – Operational Support Flyers. For the purpose of this instruction, this group will consist
of Medical Technicians and Combat Camera personnel. Med Techs only need to complete
Physiological training, Emergency Egress (non-ejection), and Aircrew Life Support Equipment
training. Combat Camera personnel need all OSF training events.
4.6. Flying Training.
   4.6.1. Applicability. MR crewmembers will accomplish all of the applicable events as
   required by Table 4.3, Table 4.4, and Table 4.5 Basic mission capable crewmembers will
   accomplish 100% of their basic volume and basic/mission frequency requirements in Tables
   4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 and 50% of the applicable mission ready volume requirements from Tables
   4.4 and 4.5 MAJCOMs may publish tables via RAP Tasking Message (RTM) showing only
   applicable Basic Mission Capable (BMC) requirements.
   4.6.2. When to Credit Events. Training requirements may be completed on any sortie if the
   requirements of this instruction are met. Profiles and compatible events may be credited on
   the same flight.
       4.6.2.1. When more than one event is required, a proportionate share should be
       completed during the training period rather than finishing the total requirement on one
       sortie. Commanders must ensure flying training accomplishments are spread as evenly as
       possible over the training period, to ensure maximum aircrew proficiency.
       4.6.2.2. NVG events may be counted toward other similar day and non-NVG currency
       events, i.e., NVG sortie credits both night sortie and basic sortie requirements.
       Exception: NVG shipboard operations events do not credit toward day shipboard events
       per NATOPS directives.
       4.6.2.3. Logging Flying Currency in Simulators. Pilots and Flight Engineers may log up
       to 50 percent of authorized semi-annual volume requirementsin the simulator as
       prescribed in Table 4.3 and 4.4 notes. If volume currency is an odd number individuals
       will round down the number that can be logged in the simulator. For example: 3
       transition sorties are required per semi-annual period for FTL C, only one transition sortie
       may be logged per semi-annual period in the simulator.
           4.6.2.3.1. Regaining Currency in a Simulator. Individuals require a qualified Air
           Force instructor to regain currency in all items that may be logged in the simulator.
           Note: Consecutive recurrency in the same event is not permitted in the simulator.
           4.6.2.3.2. Simulator Crew Complement. Simulator crews will consist of the standard
           crew complement for the type of mission being flown, minus the cabin FE.
           Emergency procedures sortie requires an instructor pilot (active duty or contract)
           either at the controls or running the instructor operator station.
           4.6.2.3.3. When logging currency (volume or frequency) in the simulator, crews are
           required to complete a full aircraft/systems run-up, a minimum of 1 hour of flight
           time, a minimum of two different currency events, and aircraft/systems shutdown
AFI11-2CV-22V1 27 JANUARY 2011                                                               35


          under the supervision      of a contract      Instructor Operating Station (IOS)
          operator/instructor.
   4.6.3. Unqualified Crewmembers. Unqualified crewmembers will not log continuation
   training requirements until completion of qualification/requalification. Events completed on
   a satisfactory qualification, mission qualification, or requalification evaluation may be
   credited toward currency requirements.
   4.6.4. Flight Surgeon (FS) Continuation Training. FS will accomplish specified training
   items IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, and this instruction.
   4.6.5. Medical Technician Training. Medical technicians are not designated aircrew per AFI
   11-402. However, due to their frequent exposure to the risks associated with military flying,
   they do have certain recurring requirements.          See Table 4.2 for requirements.
   Documentation will be maintained at the squadron to which they are attached for flying.
   4.6.6. Combat Camera Training. Combat camera personnel assigned to aircrew billets are
   designated aircrew. As such, they will complete currency requirements per this instruction.
   There is no instructor or examiner designation in this crew position. Unit training will be
   delivered by IFs or IPs, as appropriate. Combat camera personnel will be assigned ARMS
   training profiles and log training accomplished on training accomplishment reports (flying)
   and AF Form 1522 (ground), ARMS Additional training Accomplishment Report.
   Documentation will be maintained at the squadron to which they are attached for flying.
   4.6.7. Parajumper/Combat Rescue Officer Training. PJ/CRO training is located in AFI 16-
   1202 Volume 1. PJ/CROs will be assigned ARMS training profiles
4.7. Multiple Qualifications.
   4.7.1. Multiple aircraft-qualified crewmembers must complete 100 percent of the
   requirements for qualification and continuation training. Basic qualification requirements
   (Table 4.3) must be maintained in each aircraft (Exception: Basic qualification volume
   requirements in Table 4.3 may be completed in either a CV-22, MV-22 or the simulator).
   Example: A sortie and instrument approach must be completed every 45 days in each
   aircraft qualified. Multiple aircraft-qualified individuals maintain mission ready status by
   completing 50 percent of the mission requirements for each MDS aircraft in which qualified.
   4.7.2. Procedures for approval of multiple qualifications are contained in AFI 11-202, Vol.
   1, as supplemented and AFI 11-2CV22, Vol. 2.
   4.7.3. DSOs are tasked to fly on all AFSOC aircraft and will maintain multiple qualifications
   as required IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 2, AFSOC Supplement. They will comply with each
   MDS Vol 1 DSO semi-annual ground and flying training currency requirements for each
   aircraft in which qualification is held. DSOs who fall under the Multiple Qualification
   tables, regardless of which flying training level they are assigned or level of aircraft
   qualification, will log a minimum of one Tactical Mission Sortie for each aircraft that they
   hold qualification each semi-annual period. The Aircrew Proficiency Sortie may be logged
   on any AFSOC aircraft in which qualification is held. For DSOs who maintain cross-MDS
   qualification, the FTL requirements will be halved for each weapons system.
4.8. Basic Aircraft Qualification Event Definitions.

   4.8.1. Basic Aircraft Qualification Continuation Training Events. The following are
   definitions of required simulator and flying training events to maintain basic qualification in
   the aircraft. Refer to Table 4.3 for specific requirements. If circumstances beyond the
   control of the aircrew prevent completion of all profile items or events on a single sortie,
   those items or events not completed may be accomplished on a subsequent sortie and logged
   for currency.

                             AIRCREW TRAINING RECORDS

6.1. General. This chapter provides guidelines on proper training documentation. Instructions
are provided for AF Form 4109, SOF/CSAR Aircrew Training Record, AF Form 4110,
Comments-SOF/CSAR Training Record, and AF Form 4111, SOF/CSAR Training. MAJCOM
approved substitutes may be utilized in lieu of these forms. Approved products will be posted on
the MAJCOM training office website.
   6.1.1. When formal school syllabi and/or courseware are available (either AETC or other
   MAJCOM FTU), this material will be used for training. MAJCOM-approved substitutes to
   these products may be authorized on a case-by-case basis. When formal products are not
   available, a MAJCOM-approved substitute consisting of the AF Form 41XX series of forms
   (4109/4110/4111) will be utilized. All approved syllabi and courseware will be posted on the
   MAJCOM training office website.
6.2. Career Training Folder (AFSOC only). Units will maintain a career training folder for
all assigned or attached crewmembers. All completed training records will be included in a
single binder of appropriate size to provide an accurate representation of an individual’s long
term progression and any positive or negative trends related to their training.
   6.2.1. The name of the crewmember will be clearly posted on both the binder spine and front
   cover. The front cover must also prominently display the following statement: ―PRIVACY
   ACT INFORMATION – The information accessed through this system is FOR OFFICIAL
   USE ONLY and must be protected in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 and AFI 33-
   332.‖ Each training record within the binder will be tabbed separately to differentiate
   between programs. The binder will be divided into sections as follows:
       6.2.1.1. Section 1 – Table of Contents. This should clearly list each item contained
       within the binder and the tab where it is located. It should be kept as current and accurate
       as possible and clearly display the date of the last update.
       6.2.1.2. Section 2 – Record of Review. The training section will review the career
       training folder for accuracy and completeness annually. Annotate the date of review as
       well as the name and office symbol of the reviewing official. Include any comments or
       discrepancies noted. If an expanded explanation is necessary, use an MFR signed by the
       unit training officer. File these documents behind the record of annual review in
       chronological order with the most recent on the bottom. No annual review is required for
       crewmembers in inactive/non-flying positions. Annotate the timeframe during which the
       individual was in non-flying status in appropriate chronological space in the record of
       annual review (i.e., May 2002-Jun 2005 Inactive/AFSOC Staff).
       6.2.1.3. Section 3 – Completed Training Records. This section will ideally contain all
       flight training records (qualifications, certifications, specialized mission training, etc.),
       whether they are completed in-unit or at the FTU. The records will be in chronological
       order starting with initial qualification and ending with the most recently completed
       training on the bottom. Each training record within the folder will be tabbed separately to
       differentiate between programs. The tabs will be numbered in order with the member’s
       initial qualification (whether completed at the FTU or in-unit) labeled Tab #1.
 48                                                       AFI11-2CV-22V1 27 JANUARY 2011


   6.2.2. Career training folders are covered by the Privacy Act of 1974 and shall be used for
   official business only. Maintain folders in a secure area within the unit’s training section.
   Only instructors and supervisors should have regular access to these records. Individuals
   may sign out their own records.
   6.2.3. When a crewmember makes a PCS move, the squadron training section will copy the
   table of contents and record of annual review as a minimum. The unit shall seal the career
   training folder in an envelope along with the individual’s FEF and give it to the member for
   delivery to the next duty station.
       6.2.3.1. Crewmembers PCS to an active flying assignment. The losing unit squadron
       training section will keep these documents for 6 months from the date the individual
       departs home station, in the event records are lost or destroyed en route.
       6.2.3.2. Crewmembers PCS to an in-active flying assignment, separating, or retiring.
       The losing unit squadron training section shall keep these copies until the member arrives
       at his next flying assignment or 5 years (whichever is less).
6.3. Entry into Upgrade. Initiate a training folder (AF Form 4109) for ETCA formal training
courses (formal school or in-unit), mission certification, special qualification, certification
training, in-unit upgrade program to the next higher crew qualification, requalification training
(formal school or in-unit), and all corrective action or additional training. Each training folder
must include documentation of entry into the training program by the unit leadership. This will
normally consist of an entry on the first AF Form 4110 in the trainee’s record. Units may also
substitute a copy of the minutes from an upgrade board, MFR, or other locally produced form in
place of the AF Form 4110 entry. This document must be signed by the unit operations officer
or commander.
6.4. AF Form 4109. These forms are the cardstock folder used to hold all required training
documents. They are available from the pubs distribution office or by establishing an account on
the AF e-publishing homepage. It is mandatory for all basic/mission qualification training and
any special mission qualification training (leading to either a special mission evaluation or
instructor certification). Some locally developed SOIs/courseware may be approved by
MAJCOM training office for implementation without the AF Form 4109, on a case-by-case
basis. An AF Form 4109 is also required for corrective action as a result of an evaluation (other
than end-of-course evaluations). This requirement may be waived by the unit operations officer
if corrective action is limited and would not warrant the initiation of a training folder. The flight
examiner who directed the additional training will annotate training deficiencies on the
AF Form 4110. "Active" AF Form 4109 records will be maintained in a location readily
accessible to instructors/trainers, supervisory personnel, and the individual aircrew member.

   6.5.4. Mission/Profile/Comments/Recommendations or Profile (strengths, weaknesses, and
   recommendation). This section shall include a write-up for each flying training event
   (simulator or aircraft) the student participates in. Write-ups may be included for ground
   training at unit discretion. It will also contain any additional information pertinent to the
   individual’s training (i.e. recommendations for proficiency advance, monthly/quarterly
   reviews, etc). Write-ups for student flying training events should comply with the following
   format:
       6.5.4.1. Profile. This section should start by listing the sortie or event completed and the
       grade earned; or indicate why the sortie was incomplete, if it was not finished for any
       reason, and what items yet remain to complete it. A brief description of weather and
       other related factors (i.e., EMI levels for an NVG sortie or sea state for a water ops sortie)
       should be the next item. The rest of the section should be a brief summary of training
       completed, to include specific events and number of iterations where relevant. It should
       be written so that the next instructor has no doubts where to pick up the training.
       Detailed comments will be entered whenever the performance level attained is below the
       printed RPL.
       6.5.4.2. Strengths. This section should be a brief summary of the student’s strengths.
       Make every effort to identify useable, relevant strengths to further build a picture of
       student progression for the next instructor. There should always be some strength or
       strengths to emphasize but if the sortie does not lend itself to identifying any or none are
       honestly noted, state ―none noted.‖ If no strengths are noted, strong consideration should
       be given to awarding the student an ―unsatisfactory‖ for the training period.
       6.5.4.3. Weaknesses. This section should be a brief summary of the student’s
       weaknesses. It should, again, contribute to the next instructor’s ability to understand the
       proficiency level the student has attained. It should also give the student areas in which
       to strive for improvement. An honest assessment is critical but avoid being overly harsh
       or judgmental. There should always be some weakness or weaknesses to emphasize but
       if the sortie does not lend itself to identifying any or none are honestly noted, state ―none
       noted.‖ If no weaknesses are noted, strong consideration should be given to awarding the
       student an ―excellent‖ for the training period.
       6.5.4.4. Recommendations. This section is written primarily for the next instructor but
       should also include recommendations for the student where applicable. List items the
       next trainer should emphasize or other suggestions to maximize the student’s next
       training event. Enter the next recommended step for the student (i.e., continue with
       training, proceed to evaluation, proficiency advance, etc).
       6.5.4.5. The individual making the entry will sign after each write-up, and print his/her
       name and crew/supervisory position. The student will initial next to the trainer’s
       signature. This only indicates that he/she has read and understands the entry. It does not
       necessarily indicate agreement/concurrence.
6.6. AF Form 4111. This form is used to document required maneuver information file (MIF)
items and required proficiency level (RPL). Typically, this will be a pre-printed form provided
by the FTU. Locally developed overprints may be used when formal courseware is not
available. These must be approved by MAJCOM training office prior to use and will be posted
 52                                                     AFI11-2CV-22V1 27 JANUARY 2011


on the MAJCOM training office website.         Comply with the following instructions when
completing the AF Form 4111.
   6.6.1. Name. Self explanatory.
   6.6.2. Crew Position. For aircrew members in a program designed to advance them to a
   higher crew position, enter the qualification to which they are upgrading. For all other
   training, enter the crew position currently held.
   6.6.3. Course/Phase. Enter formal course title if one exists or enter a descriptive identifier
   for other types of training (i.e., HH60G-MP-UQ, ELMO Certification, Sling Load
   Certification, etc).
   6.6.4. Programmed Training Profile. This line should contain the sortie identifiers for each
   training event and the syllabus-directed training time.
   6.6.5. Actual Training Profile. The instructor should fill in the actual training time the
   student received.
   6.6.6. ID. Leave blank.
   6.6.7. Task/Topic Listing. List each MIF item number from the syllabus (if applicable) and
   a description of the task required (i.e., Safety/Judgment, Lead/Wing Responsibilities, etc.) on
   a separate line.
   6.6.8. Min Event. List the minimum number of events to be completed (if applicable) before
   training can be considered complete.
   6.6.9. GR (grade)/PK (performance knowledge). List the grade or RPL to be attained on that
   sortie. On a preprinted form, the instructor should slash through the item if the RPL is met.
   If the RPL is not met or is exceeded, the actual RPL attained should be written over the
   preprinted number/letter. Standards for awarding grades should be IAW procedures listed on
   the back cover of the AF Form 4109.
   6.6.10. Req Prof Level. This is the final RPL the student must attain prior to being
   recommended for evaluation. One RPL should be listed for each MIF item or training event.
6.7. Periodic Reviews. All open training records shall be reviewed monthly by the unit training
section and quarterly by the operations officer. This review shall be documented in the AF Form
4110 and signed by the unit training representative or the operations officer, respectively. In
those months where a quarterly review is completed, the monthly review is not required.
   6.7.1. The monthly review should ensure all training is correctly documented and instructor
   write-ups adequately document student performance. If errors are discovered, take
   immediate action to correct them or document reasons the errors could not be corrected (i.e.,
   instructor not available for signature). It should also ensure the trainee is progressing in a
   satisfactory manner, identify any significant problems encountered, and recommend any
   adjustments to training.
       6.7.1.1. Review the time elapsed between training flights. If an excessive amount of
       time has elapsed between training rides, an extra training sortie (X-ride) should either be
       awarded and flown or the training section should document the reasons this additional
       training is not required at this time (N/A ANG/AFRC).
AFI11-2CV-22V1 27 JANUARY 2011                                                                  53


   6.7.2. The quarterly review should consist of a cursory look at a sampling of training
   documentation and other administrative items. The focus of this review should be primarily
   on trainee progression. The operations officer should take this time to ensure students are
   performing up to standards and the training program is meeting his goals or vision for the
   unit. Any relevant findings or recommendations should be documented at this time.
6.8. Instructions for Closing Out Training Records. Whether a training program is
successfully completed or terminated for other reasons (failure to progress, extended DNIF, etc),
the training record must be closed out. This is accomplished by a final entry in the trainee’s last
AF IMT 4110. This entry must be signed by both the unit training officer and the unit ops
officer.
   6.8.1. For successful completion of training, the entry should indicate that all training has
   been satisfactorily completed, the new qualification or certification is awarded, and all
   records have been updated (to include the 4348 or 1381, letter of Xs, FEF, and ARMS
   database as required). It should also include any restrictions (if applicable).
   6.8.2. For termination of training (for cause or unrelated factors), the entry should indicate
   the reasons for termination of the upgrade and plans to re-enter the trainee into the program
   again at a later date (if any).
6.9. Instructions for Documenting Aircrew Qualifications/Certifications. Units must
accurately track all qualifications and certifications for each crewmember. This is best
accomplished through a combination of the AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381 and a locally
generated letter of Xs (or equivalent).
   6.9.1. AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381. The 4348 or 1381 shall be maintained in the
   member’s flight evaluation folder IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 2, and AFI 11-2MDS, Vol. 2.
   Events requiring documentation on the AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381 are listed in chapter
   five of this instruction.
   6.9.2. Letter of Xs. A letter of Xs (or equivalent document) shall be maintained by each
   unit. This document is the commander’s tool to track specialized training (i.e., locally
   required certifications for new equipment or procedures) and other desired information.
   Specific procedures and format will be determined locally, but it must contain the following
   minimum information: crewmember name, highest qualification currently held, and
   specialized training not documented elsewhere. Other information may be included at the
   discretion of the unit commander. Units will forward a current copy of the letter of Xs to HQ
   AFSOC/A3TR monthly.
   6.9.3. AF Form4324. This form is the source document used to update aircrew certification,
   assign training profiles, and formal flying training dates in ARMS. The squadron Stan/Eval
   or training office will complete this form and submit to SARM personnel to assign training
   profiles when a new crewmember inprocesses to the unit. Complete a new form when
   training profiles are added, aircrew certification codes change, and when formal school

simulated or actual, from a tactical or strategic tanker aircraft to a tiltrotor.
Basic Aircraft Qualification—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed training
prescribed to maintain the skills necessary to perform basic aircrew duties in unit aircraft. As
defined, this aircrew member maintains all basic qualification currency.
Basic Mission Capable—An aircrew member, who has satisfactorily completed mission
qualification training, does not maintain mission ready/combat mission ready status, but
maintains familiarization in the command or unit operational mission. As defined, this aircrew
member maintains 100 percent of all basic qualification currency events, but only 50 percent of
mission qualification events. BMC aircrew will be capable of achieving MR/CMR by beginning
to maintain 100 percent of mission qualification currency. Unit commanders may dictate
additional training as required.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed
mission qualification training and maintains qualification and proficiency in the command or unit
combat mission.
Core Mission Events—A crewmember must be qualified in all core mission events to be
considered Mission Ready (MR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC). Loss of qualification (non-
current greater than 6 months) in any core mission event results in loss of overall mission
qualification.
Core Mission Qualification Training—Mission training required to be mission ready or
mission capable by AFSOC standards.
Cross Flow—An aircrew member with previous US military pilot experience.
Currency—For the purposes of this instruction, currency will refer to frequency volume as used
by ARMS. This is used for events that are required with a specified number of days instead of a
monthly, quarterly, or semiannual period.
Deck Landing Qualifications—Landings performed on board ships for the purpose of
qualifying pilots and aircrew members for shipboard operations.
Deck landing Qualification Instructor Pilot (IP), Unit Trainer (UT), or Pilot- in-Command
(PC)—Joint terminology referring to MP, IP, or EP qualified and current in deck landings and
designated in writing by the unit commander for such purposes.
Direct Support Operator (DSO)—An AFSOC aircrew position responsible for providing threat
warning and enhanced situational awareness to SOF missions utilizing intelligence data and
expertise in the area of operations.
Eligibility Period—The 6-month period prior to the due date of an evaluation or required event.
Event—A training item to be accomplished. Multiple events may be completed and logged
during a single sortie.
Expendables—The firing of flares or chaff from aircraft while in-flight.
Field Deck Landing—Practice shipboard landings performed at a shore facility with markings
representative of a shipboard landing facility.
AFI11-2CV-22V1 27 JANUARY 2011                                                                 63


Formal School Courseware—Training materials and programs developed for training aircrew
members at formal schools. It includes all student study guides, workbooks, computer-based
training lessons, instructor guides, and applicable training records forms related to the specific
course.
Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP)—Refueling and rearming normally conducted at night
in an austere environment with engines running. Refueling can be accomplished from a variety
of fuel sources: MC-130, pre-positioned fuel stores, another tiltrotor, fuel truck, etc.
Hot Refueling—Fuel on load from any fuel source with one or more aircraft engines operating.
FARP operations are considered hot refueling.
Instructor Certified Event Training—Training given to an aircrew member to certify the
student's attainment of the required proficiency and knowledge levels as specified in training
course syllabi. This training must be accomplished prior to performing unsupervised crew duties
in that event. An evaluation is not normally given for this certification. Instructor certified
events will be documented on the AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381.
Mission Design Series (MDS)—The official designation for aerospace vehicles used to
represent a specific category of aerospace vehicles for operations, support, and documentation
purposes.
Mission Essential Task Listing (METL)—A complete list of mission essential tasks (MET) for
any organization.
Mission Experience—For the purposes of this regulation, "experience" is defined as being
mission ready for one year in an AFSOC tactical qualified unit.
Mission Profile—A mission designed to penetrate and operate within a combat or threat
environment. The specific profile will be predicated on the type and level of threat.
Mission Qualified—An aircrew member who has successfully completed mission qualification
training and flight evaluation.
Mission Ready—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed mission qualification
training and maintains qualification and proficiency in the command or unit operational mission.
As defined, this aircrew member is maintaining all of the applicable mission qualification
currency requirements of this instruction.
Multi-Spot Ship—Those certified ships having two or more adjacent landing areas (IAW JSHIP
MOU).
Primary Aircraft Authorization (PAA)—Aircraft authorized for performance of the unit’s
mission (e.g., Combat, Combat Support, Training, Test and Evaluation, etc.). The PAA forms the
basis for the allocation of operating resources, to include manpower, support equipment, and
flying hour funds. The operating command determines the PAA required to meet their assigned
missions.
Primary Aircraft Authorization (PAA) time—This term also implies, for the purposes of this
instruction AFI 11-2CV-22Vol1, to the particular MDS aircraft assigned to an individual's flying
unit. PAA time refers to hours flown in unit assigned MDS aircraft (e.g., CV-22). PAA hours
are used to establish minimum flying hour requirements for upgrade to aircraft commander,
 64                                                    AFI11-2CV-22V1 27 JANUARY 2011


instructor, and flight examiner. PAA time includes all categories of flight time logged with the
exception of ―other‖ and ―student‖ time.
Required Proficiency Level (RPL)—The level at which a student must perform at a particular
phase of training. Use grading standards and definitions per Attachment 3 and AF Form 4111.
Single-Spot Ship—Those certified ships having one landing area (IAW JSHIP MOU).
Special Mission Qualification Training—Training given in a specific mission area/task that
requires a flight evaluation in that mission area or task. This training is not required to be
mission ready/combat mission ready or basic mission capable.
Total Flying Time—Total time for all aircraft flown in military service to include student time.
Total Flying Time accumulated for upgrade purposes must be in the aircrew member's current
crew position. (i.e., pilot, flight engineer).
Training Status—A status in which all of a crewmember's flying training is done under the
supervision of an instructor in the crewmember’s respective crew position.
Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS)—This event is an instructor certified event
accomplished by conducting AIE activities to any area of a surface vessel, other than the flight
deck. Refer to appropriate JSOC SOP for further details.
Volume—For purposes of this instruction, volume will be command volume as used by ARMS.
This is a numeric requirement for each event as specified in this instruction. It is broken down
into time periods: monthly, quarterly, and semiannual requirements.
