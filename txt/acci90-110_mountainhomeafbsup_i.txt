SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Revisions include
administrative updates to office symbols including e-mail addresses and contact numbers;
repositions Terms Explained under Glossary of References and Supporting Information; adds
Glossary of References and Supporting Information at Attachment 1; specifies honors and
ceremonies accorded DVs (DVs are defined in Attachment 1) for international visitors;
incorporates funds references under Funding for Quarters, Messing, and Transportation; removes
references to sending priority messages under Reporting; adds request for DV Code on
Attachment 3, Checklist for Distinguished Visitors; and provides an updated Attachment 4, Visit
Plan Sample and Attachment 5 provides a Visit Itinerary Sample.

(MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) The marquee request is now found on the MHAFB web site and
should be filled out and sent via e-mail to 366th Fighter Wing Public Affairs (366 FW/PA).
Attachment 4 was changed to Attachment 6 (Added), Sample DV Notification Letter, and the
requested information was also changed.
1. Policy. Distinguished Visitors (DV) to components of Air Combat Command are a matter of
command interest and should be provided every appropriate consideration. All supporting
agencies must plan and coordinate DV visits. Refer all requests to visit Nellis AFB activities and
ranges to the USAF Warfare Center Protocol Office (USAFWC/CCP), the coordinating agent for
all Nellis AFB visits.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. Commanders/Staff Agency Chiefs. Commanders and staff agencies at all levels will
     plan for and execute any visit within their area of responsibility. Commanders will appoint an
     office or officer to control the overall DV program under their command. This should be the
     Command Section wherever possible. The Director of Staff, or the appointed office or
     officer, will evaluate the scope of interest of each DV visit and task an appropriate office of
     primary responsibility to prepare the details of the visit.
     2.1. (MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) For MHAFB, DVs are military officers in the rank of
     colonel and above, chief master sergeants holding senior enlisted positions at wing or higher
     levels, civilian employees in the grade of General Schedule/General Manager (GS/GM)-15 or
     above, foreign visitors of comparable grade, and other civilians as determined by the 366th
     Fighter Wing Commander (366 FW/CC).
     2.2. Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). The OPR is responsible for providing the
     composition of the visiting party and all schedules of event details, to the DV monitor in a
     timely manner. The OPR will also coordinate all staff participation and arrange support
     requirements as determined by the DV monitor.
ACCI90-110_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2010                                                   3


   2.2. (MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) The DV monitor is 366 FW/CCP (Protocol) and is also the
   OPR for all DV visits. 366 FW/CCP will oversee every DV visit with the assistance of an
   appointed project officer (PO).
3. Procedures:
   3.1. Notifications. Any staff agency or subordinate unit that receives notification of visits or
   requests will direct this information to the Director of Staff and will perform the following
   actions.
      3.1.1. Assemble pertinent data and find out scope and purpose. If appropriate, prepare a
      memo for signature of the Commander or Director of Staff appointing the OPR for the
      visit. The Commander may choose, due to the nature of the visit, to keep supervision of
      the visit within the Command Section and task the DV monitor to act as OPR.
      3.1.2. Notify ACC Protocol (HQ ACC/DSP) by email (accdsp@langley.af.mil) of the
      upcoming visit following the format in Attachment 2.
      3.1.3. Coordinate with the ACC Security Assistance Branch (HQ ACC/A3TS) on all
      visits by foreign nationals and/or international organizations. This is to ensure the
      Secretary of the Air Force’s International Affairs (SAF/IA) office has approved this visit
      and appropriate disclosure guidance has been issued.
   3.2. Project Officer. Upon notification, the appointed OPR will designate a project officer to
   coordinate and monitor all aspects of the visit and provide pertinent information to the DV
   monitor. The project officer can use or modify the checklist at Attachment 3 to meet local
   planning needs.
4. Meeting and Hosting Officials:
   4.1. Senior officers of the installation, unit and staff agencies directly involved in the visit
   will normally meet and host DVs. The head of the respective agencies will represent staff
   agencies having an interest in the visit, at official and social functions required by the visit
   plan.
   4.2. The senior commander will specify the uniform for the visit. All personnel involved in
   the visit should dress alike, in accordance with AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance
   of Air Force Personnel.
5. Special Requirements and Guidance for OPRs Visit Preparation:
   5.1. If a requirement exists for static display of aircraft, aerial demonstration and orientation
   flights, the OPR will pass the requirement to the organization's operations and public affairs
   officer for proper planning, staffing and coordinating, to include higher headquarters (HHQ)
   approval if required. The OPR will have an alternate plan in case of inclement weather.
   5.2. When a DV spouse is not included in the official briefings, ask the spouse of the senior
   ACC officer to act as the escort or appoint a senior ACC officer as the escort. An itinerary
   should be prepared by the OPR for the spouse.
   5.3. For international visitors, determine their language capability. If they are not fluent in
   English, the OPR should provide an interpreter, a person who speaks the visitor's language
   and understands their customs, to serve as translator/escort throughout the visit.
 4                         ACCI90-110_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2010


     5.4. Provide visitors the opportunity to observe their own religious and dietary customs.
     Special instructions are normally sent from HHQ in the case of official international visitors.
     If in doubt, the OPR should check with HHQ or with local sources of information. The visit
     OPR will find out if there are any dietary restrictions and/or preferences.
     5.5. DV Accorded Honors and Ceremonies. The Air Force Foreign Liaison Division
     (AF/CVAI) will advise the visited organization if honors are desired for international
     visitors.
     5.6. Funding for Quarters, Messing, and Transportation. Provide accommodations
     commensurate with the DV's position. This does not relieve the visitor from paying for
     lodging, messing and commercial transportation fees. A U.S. military escort who is
     responsible for settlement of these details will normally accompany international DVs. For
     official receptions and dinners, fund on an individual basis and normally within the following
     areas:
        5.6.1. International DVs (Escorted Visits). Funds are normally available to the escort
        officer on escorted visits directed by the Department of Defense, Department of Army,
        Navy, or Air Force. Do not use appropriated funds (official representation funds) to
        supplement funds provided by AF/CVAI.
        5.6.2. International DVs (Other Than Escorted Visitors) and Certain U.S. DVs. Use
        appropriated Official Representation Funds (contingency funds) in accordance with AFI
        65-603, Official Representation Funds--Guidance and Procedures when hosting on behalf
        of COMACC or CV.
        5.6.3. Determine the type of funds to be used before the visit occurs. Prior coordination
        is required through the local Comptroller or Services squadron when local official
        representation funds (AFI 65-603) or special morale and welfare funds (AFI 34-201, Use
        of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs)) are to be used. Follow this guidance when amenities
        and mementos are appropriate for presentation.
6. Reporting:
     6.1. Headquarters Air Combat Command Notification:
        6.1.1. Report to HQ ACC/DSP by e-mail at the earliest date possible, all three-star or
        equivalent and above visits, as well as the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force.
        6.1.2. The information reported will be used to brief the ACC Commander and staff.
        Visit report may be provided to HQ ACC/DSP by e-mail to accdsp@langley.af.mil
        (preferred), message or facsimile to DSN 575-5238/COMM 757-225-5238. The format is
        provided in Attachment 2. Fax or e-mail information on short notice visits within 48
        hours of notification (call to verify receipt of fax). See Attachment 2, Sample DV
        Notification Memo Format.
        6.1.3. Do not report visits by ACC personnel.
        6.1.4. Do not send duplicate notifications unless original information has changed. If so,
        indicate what is different on the new message.
        6.1.5. HQ AF/CVAI notifications to the ACC Directorate of Staff (HQ ACC/DS) of
        upcoming visits, do not relieve the OPR of notification procedures to HQ ACC/DSP.
ACCI90-110_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 8 DECEMBER 2010                                                 5


       6.1.6. In the event of an unfavorable incident or a significant change to the DV itinerary,
       the host commander or designated OPR will immediately telephone the HQ ACC OPR (if
       assigned), HQ ACC/DSP or the ACC Deputy Director of Staff (HQ ACC/DSA). If
       appropriate, the ACC OPR will inform the Command Section of the incident or change.
7. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) 366th Fighter Wing Reporting Procedures:
   7.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) The sponsoring agency will prepare a visitor letter
   as identified in Attachment 6 (Added), Sample DV Notification Letter. Deliver a hard copy
   or e-mail the visitor letter via Public Key Infrastructure encryption to 366 FW/CCP to the
   following address: 366WG/CCPProtocol@mountainhome.af.mil. Immediately notify 366
   FW/CCP of short-notice DV visits (less than 10 working days) prior to preparing the visitor
   letter.
   7.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) The group commander responsible for the area of
   primary interest for the DV visit will appoint a PO. The PO will work with Protocol who is
   responsible for drafting the visit plan and/or itinerary IAW ACCI 90-110. Protocol will
   complete arrangements with the help from the PO and coordinate with affected agencies.
   Forward the proposed visit plan and/or itinerary to the appropriate group commanders and
   366 FW/CC when plans for the visit are firm.
   7.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Request marquee announcements, through 366
