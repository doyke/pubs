This manual provides supplemental Air Force guidance to DoD 5210.42-R, Nuclear
Weapons Personnel Reliability Program (PRP), June 30, 2006, and is effective immediately.
Original DoD text appears in regular font and added Air Force text appears in bold. It
implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 13-5, Air Force Nuclear Enterprise, for PRP
form usage. No supplemental guidance to this manual is authorized.

It establishes Air Force requirements and policy for the implementation of the PRP to
select and maintain reliable individuals to perform duties associated with nuclear weapons.
The PRP applies to active duty, Reserve, and National Guard units possessing nuclear
weapons or Nuclear Command and Control systems and equipment, and any activity
certified by a Service inspection activity as “nuclear capable.” Unless otherwise noted,
Headquarters Air Force Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration, Functional
Authority Division (AF/A10-F) is the waiver authority to policies contained in this
supplement and the coordination office for any recommended waivers from the AF to DoD
5210.42-R.

The PRP is not intended to act as a quality control tool to decertify/disqualify individuals
solely for assignment purposes or risk avoidance. The denial or eligibility or the revocation
of certification for assignment to PRP positions is neither a punitive measure nor the basis

for disciplinary action (Reference [h]). The failure of an individual to be certified for
assignment to PRP duties does not necessarily reflect unfavorably on the individual’s
suitability for assignment to other duties (Reference [h]).

This Supplement requires the collection of information protected by the Privacy Act of
1974 and Health Information and Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA). The authority
to collect this information is in Title 10, United States Code, Section 8013. System of
Records Notice F036 AF PC Q, Personnel Data System (PDS), also applies. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, the Privacy Act of 1974,
HIPAA, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule.

       This Regulation is issued under the authority of DoD Directive 5210.42, “Nuclear Weapons Personnel
       Reliability Program (PRP),” January 8, 2001. It reissues DoD 5210.42-R, “Department Of Defense
       Nuclear Weapon Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) Regulation,” January 8, 2001 (hereby canceled)
       and establishes requirements and procedures for the implementation of the PRP to select and maintain
       only the most reliable people to perform duties associated with nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons
       require special consideration because of their policy implications and military importance, their
       destructive power, and the political consequences of an accident, loss of a weapon, or an unauthorized act.
       The safety, security, control, and effectiveness of nuclear weapons are of paramount importance to the
       security of the United States.

       This Regulation applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Departments, the Chairman
       of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Combatant Commands, the Office of the Inspector General of the
       Department of Defense, the Defense Agencies, the DoD Field Activities, and all other organizational
       entities within the Department of Defense (hereafter referred to collectively as the “DoD Components”).
       It also applies to DoD military and civilian personnel and contractor employees assigned to PRP positions
       or in training for assignment to PRP positions.

       This Regulation is effective immediately. Because of substantive changes, this Regulation must be
       reviewed in its entirety. Heads of DoD Components may elect to issue supplementary instructions
       deemed essential to the accommodation of requirements peculiar to their operations. Any such instruction
       may not conflict with the provisions of this Regulation. Any additional guidance issued by the DoD
       Components shall be forwarded to the address below within 30 days after publication and after each
       subsequent change for review.

       Send recommended changes to this Regulation to:

                       DATSD/NM, Room 3C125

                                          DEFINITIONS


DL.1. Access. Opportunity to tamper with or modify a nuclear weapon, critical nuclear weapon
system component or positive control/Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) material. A person
who is escorted by and/or under observation of PRP-certified individual(s) capable of detecting
unauthorized actions is not considered to have access.

DL.2. Active Service. For assignment to the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP), active
service is: active duty in the U.S. military; employment in the Federal Civil Service;
employment by a U.S. Government contractor involving access to classified information under
the National Industrial Security Program; continuous Federal service; service as a cadet or

    DL.2.1. An interruption in active service of over 24 months constitutes a break in active
service. (Added)(AF) A break in service will invalidate an individual’s personnel security
clearance eligibility (References [f] and [x]).

    DL.2.2. It is not the intent of this Regulation to allow repeated, short-term certifications into
the PRP. Personnel must remain PRP certified while assigned to a PRP position in order to
afford the certifying official the opportunity for longer-term, continual evaluation. Personnel
must meet at the minimum, the standard outlined in section C4.2. if permanent duty assignments
do not permit routine observations on a day-to-day basis.

    DL.2.3. Assignment as a Reserve Officers Training Corps, Merchant Marine Academy, and
Maritime Academy cadet or midshipman is not considered active service. (Added)(AF) An
officer commissioned through the Reserve Officer Training Corps with no prior active
service and whose commissioning is delayed does not have a break in active service.

DL.3. Agency and Installation PRP Monitor. An individual in the military grade of E-5 or
above, or a civilian in the equivalent grade, appointed to administer and conduct oversight of the
day-to-day functions of the PRP at DoD Agencies and installations.

DL.4. Alcohol Abuse. A maladaptive pattern of alcohol use as defined by the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association
(Reference (b)).

DL.5. Alcohol Dependence. Psychological and/or physiological reliance on alcohol, as such
reliance is defined by Reference (b).

DL.6. Alcohol-Related Incident. Any behavior to include misconduct or substandard
performance in which the consumption of alcohol by the individual is a contributing factor as
determined by the certifying official with consultation from the competent medical authority
(CMA).

    DL9.1. (Added)(AF) Air Force Division of the DoD Central Adjudication Facility
(DoD CAF/AF). The designated authority to grant, suspend, deny, or revoke personnel
security clearance eligibility to include SCI. Issues security clearance eligibility and enters
the determination into the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS).

DL.10. Certifying Official. For military and DoD civilian personnel, the commander, or DoD
military or civilian official, in a PRP position, responsible for nuclear weapons and/or NC2

continual evaluation of their performance and reliability. For DoD contractor personnel, the
certifying official shall be the DoD military or civilian official designated in the contract.

DL.11. Competent Medical Authority (CMA). Must be a U.S. Military healthcare provider or a
U.S. healthcare provider employed by or under contract or subcontract to the U.S. Government
or U.S. Government contractor. They must be awarded regular clinical privileges for
independent practice according to Service regulations by the healthcare facility responsible for
the provider's place of duty, or if not privileged for independent practice, then be supervised by a
CMA physician who is privileged to practice independently. Be specifically trained as a CMA
and be appointed as a CMA by the medical treatment facility commander responsible for
reviewing healthcare services or conducting clinical evaluations for the purpose of the PRP.
(Added)(AF) Independent Duty Medical Technicians (IDMTs) may not be CMAs.

DL.12. Continuing Evaluation. The process by which a PRP-certified individual is observed for
compliance with reliability standards. This is an ongoing process that considers duty
performance, and on- and off-duty behavior, and reliability on a continuing and frequent basis.

                                         C1. CHAPTER 1

                                    GENERAL PROVISIONS


C1.1. PURPOSE

The purpose of the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) is to ensure that each person who
performs duties involving nuclear weapons meets the reliability standards of the PRP selected
and retained for performing duties associated with nuclear weapons or nuclear command and
control systems and equipment is emotionally stable and physically capable, and has
demonstrated reliability and professional competence. This shall be accomplished through the
initial and continual evaluation of individuals assigned to PRP duties. The management of the
PRP is a function of command. However, each person assigned to PRP duties is responsible for
their reliability and has an obligation to report to the certifying official any behavior or
circumstance about themselves or others in the PRP that may be expected to result in degradation
in job performance or personal reliability or an unsafe or insecure condition involving nuclear
weapons and/or Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) material. The PRP supporting agencies
and supervisors of individuals performing PRP duties shall assist the reviewing and certifying
officials in their initial and continuing evaluation duties by ensuring that all PDI is made
available for their consideration. This Regulation provides procedures for the implementation of
Reference (f) and DoD Directive Instruction 5210.42 (Reference (gh)).

   C1.1.1. (Added)(AF) The enduring critical purpose of the PRP remains to ensure only
those who meet stringent reliability standards perform duties associated with nuclear
weapons – conversely the PRP will ensure those who do not meet PRP standards are
excluded from performing nuclear weapons-related duties.

C1.2. PRP ADMINISTRATORS

    C1.2.1. Designation of Reviewing and Certifying Officials. The Heads of the DoD
Components shall establish procedures for formally designating the reviewing officials and
certifying officials. The certifying officials shall be designated as critical or controlled PRP
positions commensurate with the highest category of any nuclear duty position in the unit or
activity concerned.

        C1.2.1.1. (Added)(AF) Reviewing Official (RO). The wing commander/director,
including a commander/director of a non-nuclear installation, will hold this position and
will be PRP certified if performing PRP duties per AP1.T1.

        C1.2.1.2. (Added)(AF) Certifying Official (CO). Commanders/Directors at wing-
level and below, who serve and perform duties in a PRP position will be PRP certified.
Commanders/Directors above wing-level may perform the duties of a certifying official and
do not require PRP certification, unless they serve in a PRP position. If a CO is the wing
commander/director equivalent, the next level of command in the PRP operational chain
will assume RO responsibilities.



Change 1, 11/10/2009
20                                      DoD5210.42-R_AFMAN13-501 26 FEBRUARY 2014


           C1.2.1.2.1. (Added)(AF) The Wing Commander may designate the Chief of the
Command Post as the CO for command post personnel, and the Wing Commander will
serve as the Reviewing Official.

        C1.2.1.3. (Added)(AF) Limited Delegation. Commanders/Directors may delegate
RO, CO and administrative qualification authority in writing to their vice/deputy (or
equivalent, to include Director of Operations, Operations Officer, Maintenance Officer at
unit level) in their PRP operational chain-of-command. Delegation of duties should be
limited and not used on a routine basis. At or below-wing-level delegated COs must be in a
PRP position, certified (critical or controlled) equal to, or higher than the personnel they
are certifying, and appropriately trained. If the organization does not have a vice/deputy
(or equivalent) in their operational chain of command then the individual designated on an
AF IMT 35 may take on the CO duties. If no individual is designated on an AF IMT 35,
then the next higher echelon in the operational chain of command will assume CO duties.
If the CO is decertified or otherwise removed from duties, the RO will appoint CO duties,
as appropriate.

       C1.2.1.4. (Added)(AF) Commanders/Directors at Non-PRP Installations.
Commanders/Directors who only perform administrative qualification are not COs and are
not required to be PRP certified. Commanders/Directors may delegate administrative
qualification authority in writing to their vice/deputy (or equivalent) in their chain of
command. Delegation of duties should be limited and not used on a routine basis.

          C1.2.1.4.1. (Added)(AF) If the organization does not have a vice/deputy (or
equivalent) in their operational chain of command then the individual designated on an AF
IMT 35 may assume administrative qualification duties. If no individual is designated on
an AF IMT 35, then the next higher echelon in the operational chain of command will
assume administrative qualification duties.

    C1.2.2. Designation of Competent Medical Authority (CMA). The Heads of the DoD
Components shall establish procedures to appoint an agency or installation CMA to act as a PRP
medical consultant to provide recommendations to the reviewing and certifying officials on
individuals’ suitability to perform PRP duties.

      C1.2.2.1. (Added)(AF) MTF CMA. The MTF commander (MTF/CC) will appoint
a Lead CMA to act as the primary MTF liaison to the CO for all health related PRP
recommendations. The MTF/CC may also appoint an Alternate Lead CMA and additional
providers qualified to serve as functional CMAs/liaisons for functional area
responsibilities.

          C1.2.2.1.1. (Added)(AF) For TFI units, the MTF/CC may appoint an ARC Lead
CMA to perform Lead CMA duties under the oversight of the MTF Lead CMA for matters
pertaining to the ARC PRP.

    C1.2.3. Agency and Installation PRP Monitor. DoD agencies, installations, and subordinate
units with large PRP populations shall consider appointing a PRP monitor(s) as appropriate, to
DoD5210.42-R_AFMAN13-501 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                       21

coordinates and disseminates PRP information to the reviewing and certifying officials, unit
commanders, PRP monitors, and supporting staff agencies; indoctrinates and trains unit PRP
personnel and administrators on program objectives and procedures; maintains the installation
PRP roster; and conducts staff assistance visits to all subordinate units with a PRP.

      C1.2.3.1. (Added)(AF) MAJCOM Monitor. The MAJCOM directorates will
appoint individuals as the command focal points for all applicable PRP functional areas.

       C1.2.3.2. (Added)(AF) Installation Monitor.

           C1.2.3.2.1. (Added)(AF) For PRP bases, the installation commander/director
will appoint an installation PRP monitor(s) to administer the day-to-day administrative
functions of PRP, and the installation monitor(s) will report PRP matters directly to the
Installation Commander.

            C1.2.3.2.2. (Added)(AF) On Joint Base installations, the senior Air Force
Officer in the PRP unit’s chain of command, will appoint an installation PRP monitor(s) to
administer the day-to-day administrative functions of PRP, or can delegate the
appointment authority to the FSS/CC. The installation monitor(s) will report PRP matters
directly to the Wing Commander.

          C1.2.3.2.3. (Added)(AF) For Non-PRP bases, the installation commander/
director will appoint an installation PRP monitor(s) to administer the day-to-day
administrative functions of PRP, or can delegate the appointment authority to the FSS/CC.

       C1.2.3.3. (Added)(AF) MTF Monitor. The MTF/CC will appoint MTF PRP
monitor(s) to provide administrative support. For installations with a TF I/associated
mission, the MTF/CC may appoint a Guard/Reserve PRP monitor to provide
administrative support for ARC PRP under the oversight of AD MTF PRP monitor.

        C1.2.3.4. (Added)(AF) Unit Monitor. The unit CO/CC/CL will appoint a unit PRP
monitor as the focal point for the day-to-day administrative functions of PRP, and notify
Installation and MTF PRP monitors of appropriate personnel to send PDI. The lead
contractor may appoint an individual unit contract PRP monitor as the focal point for the
day-to-day administrative functions of PRP and must coordinate with the unit CO.

           C1.2.3.4.1. (Added)(AF) For bases that perform only administrative
qualification, the Installation PRP monitor may act as both the Installation and Unit PRP
monitor. The appointment letter will identify the individual as both the Installation and

                                         CERTIFICATION


C3.1. GENERAL

   C3.1.1. The certifying official shall confirm an individual’s eligibility before that individual
begins performing PRP duties. Certification and the individual’s acknowledgment of
understanding of his/her responsibilities while PRP certified shall be formally documented and
maintained while the individual is performing PRP duties.

       C3.1.1.2. (Added)(AF) Document the certification using the AF Form 286. Follow
the form disposition instructions according to PSD Guide – PRP (Reference [bb]). Update
the applicable PRP status code (Table 2).

    C3.1.2. The certifying official shall make a judgment on the reliability of each individual
identified for PRP duties. This will be based on the appropriate personnel security investigation,
physical and mental capability, review of personnel and medical records, position qualification
requirements, and a personal interview.

    C3.1.3. The certifying official shall consider all relevant facts applicable to the individual’s
performance record, the results of the PSIs and medical evaluations, and the opinions of other
agencies and personnel, as appropriate, to make the final judgment about an individual’s
reliability and whether he or she can be depended on to respond in a stable manner when
performing PRP duties. The qualifying criteria and processes described in this chapter shall be
used by the certifying official in making that judgment.


C3.2. QUALIFYING CRITERIA

  C3.2.1. Standards. The following represent the reliability standards expected of all PRP
members:

     C3.2.1.1. Physical competence, mental alertness, and technical proficiency
commensurate with duty requirements.

         C3.2.1.2. Dependability in accepting responsibilities and effectively performing in an
approved manner; flexibility in adjusting to changes in the working environment, including
ability to work in adverse or emergency situations.

      C3.2.1.3. Good social adjustment, emotional stability, personal integrity, sound

    C3.2.2. Personnel Security Investigation (PSI). An investigation required for determining
the eligibility of DoD military and civilian personnel, contractor employees, consultants, and
other persons affiliated with the Department of Defense, for access to classified information,
acceptance or retention in the Armed Forces, assignment or retention in sensitive duties, or other
designated duties requiring such investigation. PSIs include investigations of affiliations with
subversive organizations, suitability information, or hostage foreign preference and/or influence
situations conducted to make personnel security determinations. They also include
investigations of allegations that arise subsequent to adjudicative action and require resolution to
determine an individual's current eligibility for access to classified information or assignment or
retention in a sensitive position (see Reference (ef)).

    C3.2.3. Medical Evaluation. The DoD Components shall specify procedures for individual
health record information review. For the purposes of PRP, Reference (l) authorizes disclosure
of protected health information of military personnel without authorization and of civilians and
contractor employees pursuant to valid authorization. Screening of medical and dental records
must be performed by a CMA or other medical personnel specifically trained and formally
designated to perform that function. When the records review is accomplished by other than the
CMA and raises a question or identifies potentially disqualifying information about an
individual’s physical capability or mental suitability for assignment to a PRP position, the
records shall be referred to the CMA for further evaluation or medical examination. The results
of that review by the CMA along with all PDI shall be provided to the certifying official who
shall make the determination on the individual’s eligibility to perform PRP duties.

    C3.2.4. Personnel File Review. The individual’s personnel file, other official records, and
information locally available on behavior or conduct about the individual’s reliability shall be
reviewed in detail. Look for evidence of the individual’s acceptance of responsibility, exercise
of sound judgment, effective performance, and ability to adjust to changes in the working
environment. Personnel records shall reflect assignment of an individual to a PRP position.

    C3.2.5. Personal Interview. A personal interview shall be conducted by the certifying
official with each candidate for PRP duties. The personal interview shall not be conducted as a
part of a routine orientation briefing for new personnel. PDI will be sought and, if appropriate,
discussed during this interview.

   C3.2.6. Position Qualification. Demonstrate potential for technical proficiency
commensurate with nuclear weapon and/or NC2 duty position requirements.

    C3.2.7. (Added)(AF) ADMINISTRATIVE QUALIFICATION: A PRP screening
process which ensures active duty military personnel (optional for Guard/Reserve
personnel) meet PRP standards before they depart for training or assignment to PRP
duties. This process must be accomplished with the same criteria and standards as a
certification (see C3.2.) and with equivalent record access for a
RO/CO/commander/director. Unit Commanders/Directors need not be PRP certified to
perform administrative qualification. Administrative qualification does not apply to PRP-
DoD5210.42-R_AFMAN13-501 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                39


certified individuals transferring to another PRP position (see C3.5. for PRP Transfer
instructions).

       C3.2.7.1. (Added)(AF) The losing commander will complete and forward the
administrative qualification package to the gaining CO within 46 days from the date
member acknowledges receipt of PRP assignment, or training notification. The gaining
CO must review forwarded PDI and return the administrative qualification decisions
within 14 days of receipt of the administrative qualification package. Gaining CO decisions
are not required on packages that do not contain PDI (see C3.2.7.2). In certain
circumstances, the identity of gaining CO may not be known. In these special cases, the
losing CC will consider any PDI and make the administrative qualification decision.
Note: At the short-tour locations, follow-on assignment qualifications will be accomplished
by the losing commander within 180 days prior to assignment departure.

           C3.2.7.1.1. (Added)(AF) Units will use the Administrative Qualification “How-
To” checklist and have the individual complete the PRP questionnaire. The losing unit will
provide the completed questionnaire to the gaining CO. Additional tools (e.g., interview
guide, records review, PDI information sheet, training, etc.) can also be found on the AF
PRP website.

          C3.2.7.1.2. (Added)(AF) PRP Monitors will notify their Unit Commander of
administrative qualifications exceeding the timeline requirement (see C2.15.4).

        C3.2.7.2. (Added)(AF) PDI. If there is no PDI, the losing commander/director will
complete the administrative qualification. If PDI is found, the losing commander/director
will forward the PDI to the gaining CO after records screening and CC interview, to allow
the gaining CO to review and consider acceptance. If gaining CO accepts, the losing
commander/director processes administrative qualification. If not accepted, gaining CO
will provide rationale relevant to PRP standards and losing commander/director will
annotate/update disqualification. Once the individual is administratively qualified,
continuous monitoring procedures as outlined in paragraph C3.2.7.5. apply. Any time
prior to certification in the PRP, if permanent disqualifying information (see C5.3.2.) is
found, the candidate must be permanently disqualified.

            C3.2.7.2.1. (Added)(AF) Screening Process. Includes security review, medical
evaluation, personnel file review and losing CC interview (see C3.3.). Administrative
qualification records screening for previously PRP certified individuals need only screen
since last performed PRP duties (see Table 2 – Code J).

               C3.2.7.2.1.1. (Added)(AF) Individual must have a current security clearance
as outlined in paragraph C3.3.1.1. or C3.3.1.2. If individual does not possess a valid
security investigation or the PR is over 4 years and 10 months prior to member’s departure
date a security investigation or PR must be submitted prior to completing administrative
qualification.

        C3.2.7.3. (Added)(AF) Qualification Documentation. Complete the applicable
portions of the AF Form 286 (Sections I & II). Maintain an electronic record on file six
months from the date of the RNLTD or until verified as received by the gaining
installation, whichever is later. For individuals administratively qualified then
subsequently sent to a non-PRP assignment, the losing unit must maintain the electronic
record for six months after the RNLTD. Electronically send completed AF Form 286 to the
gaining installation PRP monitor for use in certification. Follow additional disposition
instructions according to PSD Guide – PRP (Reference [bb]). Ensure PDS is updated with
PRP status code (see Table 2). Ensure all personnel and medical records are labeled
“PRP”.

       C3.2.7.4. (Added)(AF) Disqualification/Permanent Disqualification
Documentation. The losing commander will complete the AF Form 286
(disqualification)/AF Form 286A (permanent disqualification). Additionally, the losing
commander will make the necessary notifications to cancel the training and/or assignment.
The Installation/Unit PRP monitor will forward the applicable form to AFPC or ARPC
PRP processing utilizing Case Management System (CMS) or a suitable substitute.
Maintain an electronic copy on file until original is verified and filed in the member’s
Official Military Personnel File (OMPF). Follow additional disposition instructions
according to PSD Guide – PRP (Reference [ff]). Ensure PDS is updated with PRP status
code (see Table 2).

       C3.2.7.5. (Added)(AF) Continuous Monitoring. Once administrative qualification
is complete, continuous monitoring is required.

          C3.2.7.5.1. (Added)(AF) The losing CC will continue to pass to the gaining CO
any PDI or situation that may affect the individual’s PRP assignment eligibility. The losing
CC will notify the individual’s supervisor and First Sergeant of the pending PRP
assignment in order to maintain continuous monitoring.

           C3.2.7.5.2. (Added)(AF) The CMA at the losing base will continue to pass any
medical PDI or medical conditions that negatively impact the member’s assignment, their
status as worldwide qualified or their physical ability to perform their PRP duties, to the
losing commander.

           C3.2.7.5.3. (Added)(AF) The individual, once administratively qualified, will
adhere to the following roles and responsibilities:

               C3.2.7.5.3.1. (Added)(AF) Be responsible for monitoring their own reliability
and the reliability of others in the PRP. This is a 24 hours per day, seven days per week
responsibility. Failure to adhere to these responsibilities may cast doubt on an individual’s
reliability.

             C3.2.7.5.3.2. (Added)(AF) Be aware of how problems, concerns, and
circumstances may reduce individual effectiveness and impair capability or reliability.
DoD5210.42-R_AFMAN13-501 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                       41

Readiness Center, medical clinics, Military One Source etc.) of his/her PRP status before
seeking advice or treatment.

              C3.2.7.5.3.5. (Added)(AF) Inform supervisors or the commander when
another individual in the PRP appears to be involved in situations that may affect
reliability.

       C3.2.7.6. (Added)(AF) CAT I Discrepancy Reporting. The gaining CO or MPS
reports all mission impacting administrative qualification discrepancies IAW AFPC
Personnel Service Delivery Guide – Category I Discrepancy Reporting Process.
Discrepancies that delay certification or results in permanent disqualification will be
reported as “mission impact.”


C3.3. INITIAL CERTIFICATION

   C3.3.1. Personnel Security Investigation and Eligibility Requirements

        C3.3.1.1. Critical Position. Top Secret eligibility based on an SSBI, or SSBI-PR, Phased
Periodic Review Reinvestigation (PPR), or Tier 3 Investigation completed within the last 5 years
and favorably adjudicated within the last 5 years. If appropriate, a review of the results of the
investigation shall be conducted by the certifying official. If it becomes necessary to consider an
individual for a critical position and the required investigation has not been completed, interim
certification may be made (see paragraph C3.4). (Added)(AF) Use the completion date of the
last investigation to determine eligibility.

        C3.3.1.2. Controlled Position. Secret eligibility based on a NACLC, ANACI, or SPR
completed and adjudicated within the last 5 years or a favorably adjudicated SSBI, SSBI-PR,
SBI, SBI-PR, BI, BI-PR within the last 5 years. Secret eligibility based on a NACLC, ANACI,
Secret Periodic Reinvestigation (SPR), SSBI, SSBI-PR, PPR, Special Background Investigation
(SBI), SBI-PR, Background Investigation (BI), BI-PR, or Tier 2 Investigation completed within

a controlled position and the required investigation has not been completed, interim certification
may be made (see paragraph C3.4). (Added)(AF) Use the completion date of the last
investigation to determine eligibility.

       C3.3.1.3. Fulfilling Investigative Requirements.

           C3.3.1.3.1. Periodic reinvestigations are required every 5 years for both critical and
controlled positions. Investigations determined to meet PRP position requirements under
previous guidance remain valid.




Change 1, 11/10/2009
42                                        DoD5210.42-R_AFMAN13-501 26 FEBRUARY 2014


           C3.3.1.3.2. New Federal Investigative Standards issued by the Security Executive
Agent, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Suitability Executive Agent, Office
of Personnel Management (Reference (p)) will replace the traditional PR with a “Continuous
Evaluation/Reinvestigation” process. Until these new standards are implemented, agencies will
continue to use the existing investigative standards in Director of Central Intelligence Directive
6/4 (Reference (q)) until the planned implementation date.

           C3.3.1.3.3 (Added)(AF) The JPAS, or confirmation from the DoD CAF/AF, is
the official source for validating currency of PSIs. Reference previous OASD guidance
(also see C3.4.1.2. and C3.4.2.2.), individuals with PSI over 5 years (using the completion
date of the last investigation) who are currently certified in the PRP, including those
certified under the OASD waiver may remain certified, if both:

               C3.3.1.3.3.1. (Added)(AF) The periodic reinvestigation is submitted to
OPM.

             C3.3.1.3.3.2. (Added)(AF) The CO has documented a review of the
completed security questionnaire and is satisfied there is no known risk.

       C3.3.1.4. The DoD Components may establish procedures to facilitate the timely
screening of individuals required to support their wartime missions. Cost effectiveness should be
considered in the implementation of DoD Component programs. (Added)(AF) Units will utilize
screening procedures on the AF PRP website to support contingency wartime missions.

     C3.3.2. Medical Evaluation

        C3.3.2.1. As part of the required screening process, medical histories and records, if they
are sufficiently comprehensive and current for the purpose, shall be evaluated to determine the
candidate’s physical and mental qualifications under the standards for the PRP. Personnel
considered for or holding PRP positions shall make all medical records available to the certifying
official for initial and subsequent screening requirements and for inspection. See paragraph
C3.3.2.1.3 below for restrictions on access to medical records for certifying and reviewing
officials.

             C3.3.2.1.1. Screening of medical records must be performed by a CMA or other
medical personnel specifically trained and formally designated to perform that function. When
the records review is accomplished by other than the CMA and raises a question or identifies
potentially disqualifying information about an individual’s physical capability or mental
suitability for assignment to a PRP position, the records shall be referred to the CMA for further
evaluation or medical examination. The results of that review by the CMA along with all PDI
shall be provided to the certifying official who shall make the determination on the individual’s
eligibility to perform PRP duties.

           C3.3.2.1.2. If available medical records are inadequate, the CMA shall conduct an
evaluation to determine medical qualification under PRP standards. That medical evaluation
DoD5210.42-R_AFMAN13-501 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                          43


shall include a mental health consultation when indicated. All PDI of a medical nature shall be
documented in the individual’s medical records.

             C3.3.2.1.3. PRP certifying and reviewing officials are partially authorized to review
medical records of candidates and members of the PRP to make determinations required by this
Regulation. According to Reference (g), DoD medical records may be disclosed to reviewing
and certifying officials for this purpose without either a request from, or the consent of, the
individuals to whom those records pertain. PRP certifying and reviewing officials may only
have access to portions of the medical records where the CMA has identified a possible
disqualifying condition. Access is limited to the extent necessary for the certifying or reviewing
official to document the condition to make a certification/qualification determination for PRP
purposes. All PDI of a medical nature shall be documented in the individual’s medical records.

            C3.3.2.1.4. C3.3.2.1.3. Because of the sensitive and confidential nature of the
records, access shall extend only to the reviewing and certifying officials and designated PRP
inspectors (see DL.34) consistent with Reference (l). Such review shall be conducted with the
assistance of a healthcare provider who can advise on medical record data that might otherwise
be misinterpreted. See paragraph C3.3.2.1.3. for restrictions on access to medical records for
certifying and reviewing officials.

    C3.3.3. Personnel File Review. The individual’s personnel file, other official records, and
information locally available on behavior or conduct about the individual’s reliability shall be
reviewed in detail. Look for evidence of the individual’s acceptance of responsibility, exercise
of sound judgment, effective performance, and ability to adjust to changes in the working
environment.

    C3.3.4. Personal Interview. A personal interview by the certifying official shall inform the
individual of the significance of the assignment, PRP standards, the need for reliable
performance, the individual’s responsibility for self-reporting and peer review of factors and
situations that could adversely affect job performance or reliability. The certifying official will
also provide the individual the opportunity to disclose any PDI.

    C3.3.5. Proficiency Qualification. It shall be certified that the individual has had the formal
course of instruction and/or possesses the minimum level of experience required for assignment
to a particular critical or controlled PRP position.

    C3.3.6. Potentially Disqualifying Information (PDI). Central Adjudication Facilities for
military and DoD civilians or the DISCO DSS for contractor personnel, will forward all PDI, as
defined in Chapter 5 of this Regulation, on PRP individuals to the appropriate certifying
official/security manager. The certifying official will review this information and determine if
the individual’s reliability is affected and take appropriate actions. PDI previously addressed,
documented, and determined not to be disqualifying for PRP assignment need not be re-
addressed or require additional documentation unless warranted by subsequent disqualifying
information. The appropriate certifying official/security manager shall record a servicing
relationship within the DoD designated personnel security information system of record and

indicate the appropriate contact information so that the adjudication facility knows the
appropriate location to send PDI.

    C3.3.7. (Added)(AF) Certification Documentation. The certification is documented on
the AF Form 286. Forward the AF Form 286 to AFPC, Total Force Service Center for
processing, and filing in the individual’s personnel record. Reference the PRP PSD Guide
for specific form disposition instructions. The PDS is updated with a PRP status code (see
Table 2) and the date the CO certified the individual. Ensure all medical and personnel
records are labeled “PRP.”


C3.4. INTERIM CERTIFICATION

   C3.4.1. Critical Position. If it becomes necessary to consider an individual for a critical
position and the required investigation has not been completed, interim certification may be
made under the following conditions:

         C3.4.1.1. For interim critical certification, the individual must have either Secret
eligibility based on an investigation completed and adjudicated investigation within the last 5
years and favorably adjudicated, or Top Secret eligibility based on an investigation completed
and adjudicated investigation no more than 10 years ago and favorably adjudicated, without a
break in active Federal service or employment longer than 2 years. (Added)(AF) Also ensure
steps outlined in C3.4.1.2 have been completed.

        C3.4.1.2. The SSBI or Tier 3 request shall have been submitted prior to interim
certification and all other requirements of the PRP screening process shall have been fulfilled.
(Added)(AF) This includes the CO granting an interim clearance equivalent to the PRP
position, reviewing the completed security questionnaire and being satisfied there is no
known risk.

by OPM.

   C3.4.2 Controlled Position. If it becomes necessary to consider an individual for a
controlled position and the required investigation has not been completed, interim certification
may be made under the following conditions:

         C3.4.2.1. For interim controlled certification, the individual must have clearance Secret
eligibility based on an investigation which has been completed within the last 10 years and
favorably adjudicated within the last 10 years without a break in service over 2 years.
(Added)(AF) (10 year period is based on the completion date of the last investigation), and
steps outlined in C3.4.2.2 for submitting security clearance reinvestigation have been
completed.

       C3.4.2.2. The NACLC, ANACI, or SPR or Tier 2 shall have been submitted prior to
interim certification and all other requirements for the PRP screening process shall have been

fulfilled. (Added)(AF) For personnel without a previously completed security clearance
investigation or with a break in service over 2 years, this includes the CO granting an
interim clearance equivalent to the PRP position, reviewing the completed security
questionnaire and being satisfied there is no known risk.

           C3.4.2.2.1. (Added)(AF) The request shall be submitted, accepted and opened
by OPM.

   C3.4.3. Individuals with Interim Certification

         C3.4.3.1. These individuals shall be identified to supervisory personnel, entry controllers
who directly control access to exclusion areas, and others as necessary, as having only interim
certification. Entry authorization lists and individual access media shall be specifically marked
to designate interim certification status.

       C3.4.3.2. An individual with interim certification shall not be paired in a two-person
team with another individual also having only an interim PRP certification.

    C3.4.4. (Added)(AF) If the individual is not eligible for interim certification, or the CO
determines not to interim certify, update PDS with PRP status code “C” until the security
clearance determination is made and updated by the DoD CAF/AF Division.

    C3.4.5. (Added)(AF) Interim Certification Documentation. Document an interim
certification using the same procedure as a certification (see C3.3.7.).


C3.5. PERSONNEL TRANSFER

    C3.5.1. PRP-certified Individual. When a PRP-certified individual is transferred to another
PRP position, he or she must be interviewed by the new certifying official. If this transfer does
not involve a change in the reviewing official, a rescreening of the medical and personnel records
is not required. If this transfer results in a change of both certifying and reviewing officials, a
rescreening of the medical and personnel records shall be conducted. (Added)(AF) Rescreen
from the last day individual performed PRP duties to present. If the transfer does not
involve the change of the reviewing official a new AF Form 286 is not required.

       C3.5.1.1. (Added)(AF) PRP to PRP transfer. Administrative qualification does not
apply. When a PRP-certified individual transfers to another PRP position resulting in the
change of RO and CO, the losing installation updates PDS with PRP status code B (date

rescreening requirements identified in paragraph C3.5.1. Forward the AF Form 286 to
AFPC or ARPC PRP processing utilizing the CMS or a suitable substitute, for filing in the
individual’s OMPF.

       C3.5.1.2. (Added)(AF) When a PRP-certified (includes Interim and Additional
Duty) individual is transferred to a non-PRP position and no longer requires the PRP, the

certification shall administratively terminate. Update PDS (PRP Status Code J) with the
date last performed PRP (see Table 2).

      C3.5.1.3. (Added)(AF) All PRP-certified individuals who change from Critical to
Control PRP position or Control to Critical PRP position with the same RO will require a
new AF Form 286 be completed using the current PRP certification date.

    C3.5.2. PDI. PDI previously addressed, documented, and determined not to be disqualifying
for PRP assignment need not be re-addressed or require additional documentation unless
warranted by subsequent disqualifying information.

                                        C4. CHAPTER 4

                                 CONTINUING EVALUATION


C4.1. GENERAL

Certifying officials are responsible for ensuring that all military, civilian, and contractor
personnel assigned to PRP positions meet all of the requirements of the continuing evaluation
process. Certifying officials must also observe the behavior and performance of members
certified under the PRP on a frequent and consistent basis. The primary consideration for
certifying officials should be that the sum of the observation, both personal and through peer
observation and reporting, is sufficiently detailed to allow for close evaluation of the individual.
Observation of performance and behavior need not be limited to duty in a single capacity. While
observation of PRP duties should be primary, additional observation when not executing PRP
duties as a government civilian employee, a private contractor to the Government, a military
service member, or a combination of these can also serve to add to the certifying official’s
evaluation.


C4.2. MINIMUM STANDARDS

Members whose permanent duty assignments do not permit routine observation/peer reporting
on a day-to-day basis must be monitored with particular diligence. For those personnel whose
normal duties or assignments do not provide for routine observation (excluding periods of
administrative absence (leave/pass/temporary duty, TDY, or TAD)), certifying officials must
demonstrate an ability to maintain an equivalent level of confidence in the reliability of those
members as would be available through routine, day-to-day contact and peer reporting.
Individuals certified under PRP must be aware and agree that certain information/materials
concerning their activities (medical, mental health, police, employment records, credit reports,
etc.) both on- and off-duty, are to be provided for review voluntarily to certifying officials,
CMAs, and inspectors and that failure to provide the requested materials may result in
suspension or decertification. (Added)(AF) In most cases, individuals will remain certified
under their current CO if performing PRP duties while TDY.

    C4.2.1. Certification for personnel who do not meet the requirements for routine observation
as described above, but who the certifying official believes should be certified, require
evaluation and approval by the Commander of the Combatant Command or the respective Chief
of the Military Service or designated representative. The approval authority may be delegated in
writing to a single official of at least O-7/SES grade on the staff. All exceptions will be
submitted for review on a quarterly basis to ATSD(NCB)/NM. The certifying official will
submit a specific plan outlining the application of the tools outlined in paragraph C4.2.2.,
tailored to the circumstances of the individual being considered that provides for the equivalent
level of confidence mentioned above. This provision does not apply to the certification of
certifying officials, who must meet the minimum standards for continuing evaluation in
paragraph C4.2. (Added)(AF) The AF appointed approval authority is AF/A10.



Change 1, 11/10/2009
48                                       DoD5210.42-R_AFMAN13-501 26 FEBRUARY 2014



    C4.2.2. For periods in which a PRP-certified individual was not subject to continuing
evaluation, the certifying official must ensure the individual’s reliability during these times
meets the requirements of this Regulation. The certifying official will employ additional means
and methods sufficient to assist in that determination, e.g., an additional personal interview,
periodic medical records review, additional drug screening, contact with civilian employer of
Selected Reserve personnel or previous supervisor, service/personnel records review, periodic
criminal records/history checks, and credit checks. When selected randomly for drug screening,
personnel will be required to submit to testing upon return to duty.

       C4.2.2.1. (Added)(AF) Individuals who exceed 60 calendar days without
performing official duty/training will be removed from PRP duties (Table 2, PDS Code G)
and entry control authorities will be notified. Upon return, the individual’s personnel and
medical records will be screened for PDI (back to date of G code) and the CO will conduct
an interview.

       C4.2.2.2. (Added)(AF) Documentation of healthcare that occurred during the
timeframe an individual was not performing official duty/training will be submitted to the
CMA as early as possible for review and CO advisement for adjudication prior to
performing any PRP duties.

        C4.2.2.3. (Added)(AF) MTFs will query medical, dental, and pharmacy insurance
companies for claims and payment information at least annually for all PRP personnel who
do not meet the criteria for continuous evaluation. MTFs will maintain a copy of the
request and responses in the individual’s medical record. After 90 days from the request
date, if no response is received the MTF will document “No Response Received” on the
original request form. If there is a disparity in the information received, the CMA will
forward that PDI to the CO to adjudicate and decide the best course of action.

    C4.2.3. (Added)(AF) PRP-certified individuals who are K-coded for deployment/TDY
for over 30 days are not required to contact their certifying official prior to medical care.
Upon return, the individuals’ records will be screened for PDI (back to date of K code) and
the CO will conduct an interview; this screening and interview will be documented.
Individuals are responsible for informing their CO of any situation that may affect their
reliability under PRP. Recertification is not required. (Table 2, PDS code K).


C4.3. PSI

All civilian, contractor, active duty military, and Selected Reserve personnel assigned to PRP
positions shall be subject to a PR every 5 years, according to Reference (ef). The following
applies:

    C4.3.1. Personnel assigned to serve in PRP positions will have a PSI PR submitted every 5
years regardless of when they were last certified into the PRP. (Added)(AF) Individuals
certified for PRP who have an established date of separation or retirement date within 1
DoD5210.42-R_AFMAN13-501 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                           49


year of an investigation that is out-of scope in accordance with AFI 31-501 (Reference [x])
will be allowed to remain certified until the discharge date with no PR requested.
However, should the individual decide not to separate/retire and the Commander approves
the request, a PR must be requested. Use the JPAS according to reference [f ],
adjudication guidelines, to determine current status of clearance eligibility. Installation
Information Protection office will use CATS to prioritize adjudication of completed PSI for
PRP.

   C4.3.2. A break in Federal service or Government employment exceeding 2 years, and, for
contractor employees a break in status exceeding 2 years. (Added)(AF) requires a new PSI.

    C4.3.3. The certifying official may request a new PSI based on significant derogatory
information or allegations.

   C4.3.4. Reference (p) will replace the traditional PR with a “Continuous
Evaluation/Reinvestigation” process. Until these new standards are implemented, agencies will
continue to use the existing standards in Reference (q) until the planned implementation date.
Once implemented the new frequency is:

        C4.3.4.1. At least 20 percent of subjects in Tier 2 appointed to positions that require
eligibility for access to “L" information, Confidential information, and Secret information shall
be reevaluated annually, with 100 percent being reevaluated at least once every 5 years and on
an a periodic basis or as event-driven, subject to implementing guidance.

       C4.3.4.2. Subjects in Tier 3 appointed to positions that require eligibility for access to
“Q” information, Top Secret information, or SCI shall be reevaluated annually or as event-
driven, subject to implementing guidance.


C4.4. MEDICAL EVALUATION

    C4.4.1. Each time a PRP-certified individual receives a medical evaluation and/or treatment
that may impact performance or reliability, the CMA must determine PRP reliability effects and,
if warranted, make recommendations to the certifying official. IDCs on submarines that are
underway will ensure the certifying official is apprised of any medical treatment that might affect
PRP performance and upon return to homeport, the CMA will review all treatment which could
potentially impact PRP performance. Additionally, the Services DoD Components are
authorized to establish protocols that may be applied by IDMTs at Munitions Support Squadrons
and by IDCs on submarines that do not require CMA review. When an individual’s duty
performance may be impaired by medical care or the use of prescribed medication, as
determined by the CMA, the certifying official shall be notified to decide if the individual shall
be suspended from duty involving nuclear weapons for the period of medical care or use of
medication. (Added)(AF) The recommended duration of the member’s
suspension/temporary decertification from PRP duties should be for the period of time that
they are at increased risk for impairment.




Change 1, 11/10/2009
50                                        DoD5210.42-R_AFMAN13-501 26 FEBRUARY 2014


       C4.4.1.2. (Added)(AF) At GSUs without a CMA, the IDMT consults the CMA for
PRP recommendation (IDMT documents date and name of CMA in the medical record)
and then passes the PRP recommendation to the CO. During medical SAVs, the CMA will
review all IDMT PRP recommendations not already signed by a CMA.

    C4.4.2. The certifying official shall be notified immediately by the CMA when a significant
effect on the individual’s physical or mental abilities is expected or if an individual’s behavior
indicates emotional instability, drug or alcohol abuse, or the need for treatment with narcotics,
sedatives, tranquilizers, or other drugs that could impair perception or performance. If an
individual’s reliability is not in question, the certifying official shall assess the individual’s
condition, obtain a medical evaluation of the potential effects of any medication or treatment that
may have been prescribed or purchased over-the-counter, discuss with the individual the
previous effects of such medication or treatment, if appropriate, and then decide if either
suspension, decertification, or return to PRP duties is appropriate. If there is a doubt or
disagreement among healthcare providers about an individual’s reliability, the certifying official
shall be notified and provided sufficient information to make the final PRP determination.
(Added)(AF) The CO shall be notified immediately by the CMA (GSU IDMT, MTF PRP
monitor or designee after CMA consultation). The PRP recommendation of a CMA will
take precedence over that of a non-CMA healthcare provider.

      C4.4.2.1. (Added)(AF) Contractor employees shall report healthcare visits and/or
medication changes to the PRP monitor who then notifies the MTF CMA. The CMA
reviews the medical information and provides a PRP recommendation to the CO.

      C4.4.2.2. (Added)(AF) The CO submits all contractor employee self-identified
medical treatment and evaluation to the MTF CMA for evaluation. The CMA makes a
PRP recommendation to the CO.

    C4.4.3. When a PRP-certified individual receives any private, has received non-military
medical or dental treatment and/or evaluation (including TRICARE and Civilian Health and
Medical Program of the Uniformed Services referrals) that may impact performance or
reliability, he or she will report treatment and/or evaluation to the CMA or certifying official and.
Additionally, the individual will provide appropriate documentation, when available, to the
CMA, who shall consult the certifying official if required.

       C4.4.3.1. (Added)(AF) Each installation/GSU will establish a MAJCOM approved
process to review external healthcare information submitted by members or external
provider(s) and/or agencies. Development of a standardized form based on the template
provided on the AF PRP webpage (Reference [z]) is encouraged. Prescriptions from non-
military providers for PRP individuals will not be filled, nor dispensed through the MTF
pharmacy, without documentation that the prescription has undergone the required PRP
review.

   C4.4.4. Because of the danger to public health and safety or to U.S. national security that
might result from the failure of an individual performing PRP duties to perform reliably,
mandatory substance abuse testing of all military, civilian, and contractor personnel assigned to
DoD5210.42-R_AFMAN13-501 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                      51


PRP duties shall be conducted according to DoD Directives 1010.1 and 1010.9 (References (kr)
and (ls)).

        C4.4.4.1. (Added)(AF) Drug abuse testing for military and civilian personnel
assigned to specially designated Nuclear Command and Control PRP positions identified in
Table AP1.T1. (subsequent to 25 May 93) shall be administered before the individuals
assume those duties. The AF Civilian Drug Testing Plan specifies that all Air Force civilian
PRP positions are “Testing Designated Positions,” and as such, PRP employees are subject
to random testing. These positions must be formally identified and designated on each
position description and vacancy announcement. Drug testing for contractor personnel
will be in accordance with the contract and will be equivalent to the AF Civilian Drug
Testing Plan.

    C4.4.5. Hypnosis shall not be administered to individuals certified under the PRP without
the knowledge of the individual’s certifying official. The certifying official shall evaluate the
underlying reason for seeking hypnosis and the potential impact on performance, reliability, or
safety while performing PRP duties. When screening an individual for PRP duties who has been
administered hypnosis, the CMA shall determine if there was an underlying medical reason for
the individual to seek hypnosis.

   C4.4.6. (Added)(AF) An FDA-approved OTC medication and US commercially
purchased substance, to include nutritional supplement, may be used by PRP personnel
without CMA approval, provided the product is used in accordance with US
manufacturers’ directions for its intended use. The use of herbal medications and any
supplements should be discussed with the CMA prior to use to determine intended use or
underlying condition. NOTE: Aircrew members and Missile Operator Duty personnel
must consult AFI 48-123 (Reference [cc]) for approved medication listing.

     C4.4.6.1. (Added)(AF) PRP personnel are required to consult with the CO and
CMA whenever:

          C4.4.6.1.1. (Added)(AF) The member is within 12 hours of reporting to PRP
duties and will be using the product for the first time; or

           C4.4.6.1.2. (Added)(AF) The member has questions about a product’s use or
potential side effects; or

           C4.4.6.1.3. (Added)(AF) The member experiences adverse reactions, which may
affect the member’s ability to perform duties.

   C4.4.7. (Added)(AF) COs need not be notified of routine operational use of approved
go/no-go pills. If the aircrew member experiences residual side effects of symptoms that
could impair perception of performance, it is incumbent on the individual to notify his/her
CO.

C4.5. CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS

Actions taken shall depend on the nature of the allegations and the sensitivity of the individual’s
PRP duties. After careful review of all the information, the certifying official may suspend,
decertify, or allow the individual under investigation to continue in PRP duties. In making that
determination, nuclear surety shall be the primary consideration and shall not be compromised to
aid an investigation. Regardless of the status of the investigation, when nuclear surety is
determined to be in jeopardy, the certifying official shall immediately remove the individual
from the PRP.


C4.6. CONTRACTOR PRP CONTINUING EVALUATION

Contractor employees who have been determined eligible by the contract monitor and have been
assigned to PRP positions shall be annotated in the DoD designated personnel security
information system of record or identified to DISCO DSS, P.O. Box 2499 2780 Airport Drive,
Suite 400, Columbus, Ohio 43216-5006 43219-2268. On receipt of any information that may
affect the reliability and trustworthiness of a contractor employee under the PRP, DISCO DSS
shall forward that information to the appropriate certifying official.

                DISQUALIFICATION, REMOVAL, AND REINSTATEMENT


C5.1. POTENTIALLY DISQUALIFYING OR DECERTIFYING CRITERIA

Any of the following traits or conduct may be grounds for disqualification or decertification of
individuals from the PRP. In evaluating such traits or conduct, certifying and reviewing officials
shall ensure there is no reasonable doubt of an individual’s reliability and that it is in the best
interest of national security that the individual be assigned to duties involving nuclear weapons.
If potential clearance eligibility impact is determined, the information will be provided to the
appropriate CAF or for contractor employees, to DSS.

    C5.1.1. Alcohol. Any alcohol-related incident, alcohol abuse, or alcohol dependency (see
DL.4, DL.5, and DL.6) may be grounds for removal or disqualification from PRP duties. The
certifying official, after consultation with the CMA, shall determine the degree to which an
alcohol problem impacts the reliability of the individual being considered for PRP assignment.

        C5.1.1.1. Alcohol-Related Incident. Individuals involved in an alcohol-related incident
shall be, at a minimum, suspended from PRP duties. The certifying official shall conduct an
investigation of the circumstances and request a medical evaluation. If the individual is not
returned to PRP duties within 120 days, temporary or permanent decertification actions shall be
taken, as appropriate. Individuals prescribed an alcohol awareness/training class may be
returned to PRP duties prior to completion of the class when the certifying official determines
the individual to be reliable based on the results of an investigation and medical evaluation.

        C5.1.1.2. Alcohol Abuse. Individuals diagnosed as alcohol abusers, but who are not
diagnosed as alcohol dependent, shall, at a minimum, be temporarily decertified. Those
individuals may have their temporary decertification removed and be returned to PRP duties
after successfully completing a prescribed rehabilitation program or treatment regimen, when
they have displayed positive changes in job reliability and lifestyle, and receive a favorable
medical prognosis by the CMA. Failure to satisfactorily meet these requirements shall result in
permanent decertification.

        C5.1.1.3. Alcohol Dependency. Individuals diagnosed as alcohol dependent shall be
disqualified or decertified from the PRP. (Added)(AF) An individual initially diagnosed as
alcohol dependent while on PRP will (at a minimum) be temporarily decertified pending
treatment outcomes. An individual who fails or refuses treatment for alcohol dependency
will be permanently decertified.

           C5.1.1.3.1. Individuals temporarily decertified for alcohol dependency may have
their temporary decertification removed and be returned to PRP duties after successfully
completing rehabilitation, and a minimum of 180 days of a formal aftercare program according
to DoD Instruction 1010.6 (Reference (mt)). A PRP qualification screening, to include a
favorable prognosis by the CMA, shall be completed before rescreening or recertification.

           C5.1.1.3.2. Failure to satisfactorily complete a formal aftercare program or other
alcohol-related misconduct shall result in permanent decertification or disqualification.

             C5.1.1.3.3. Any individual who voluntarily consumes alcohol after being diagnosed
as alcohol dependent shall, at a minimum, be suspended from PRP duties. The certifying
official, after consultation with the CMA, shall determine the degree to which the alcohol
consumption impacts the reliability of the individual being considered for PRP assignment. If
the individual is not returned to PRP duties within 120 days, temporary or permanent
decertification actions shall be taken, as appropriate.

        C5.1.1.4. Pre-Service (Alcohol-Related Incidents). Involvement in pre-service alcohol-
related incidents, to include underage alcohol use which resulted in legal action, does not
automatically render an individual ineligible for consideration for, or retention in, a PRP
position. It is incumbent on the certifying official to determine the degree to which the alcohol
related incidents impact the reliability of the individual being considered for PRP duties.

    C5.1.2. Drugs. Drug abuse or drug dependency (see DL.21, DL.22.) is grounds for
disqualification or decertification. A drug-related incident (see DL.23) is grounds for removal
from PRP duties. The certifying official, after consultation with the CMA, shall determine the
degree to which drug use impacts the reliability of the individual being considered for PRP
assignment.

         C5.1.2.1. Drug-Related Incident. Individuals involved in a drug-related incident shall
be, at a minimum, suspended from PRP duties. Suspension under these circumstances shall only
be used when reliability is not in question. The certifying official shall conduct an investigation
of the circumstances and request medical evaluation. If the certifying official has any reason to
doubt or suspect the individual’s reliability for PRP duties the following actions will be taken:

           C5.1.2.1.1. The individual concerned shall immediately be temporarily decertified.

          C5.1.2.1.2. A complete evaluation shall be conducted of the individual’s drug
involvement and current and past duty performance.

           C5.1.2.1.3. A PRP qualification re-screening including a complete medical
evaluation shall be started.

            C5.1.2.1.4. Removal of the temporary decertification and recertification into the PRP
shall require thorough justification and documentation for recommendation for retention in PRP
duties, a determination that recertification is in the best interest of the service and national
security, and statements by the reviewing and certifying official that the individual’s reliability is
not in doubt.

            C5.1.2.1.5. Individuals determined to be ineligible for recertification to PRP duties
shall be permanently decertified, and that action shall be made a matter of permanent record,
DoD5210.42-R_AFMAN13-501 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                             55


where applicable, such that the person cannot move to another location/unit and seek PRP
certification.

            C5.1.2.1.6. Any individual found to have been involved in the unauthorized
trafficking, cultivating, processing, manufacturing, or sale of any controlled or illegal drug, to
include cannabis-based products, shall be ineligible for PRP duties.

           C5.1.2.1.7. Any individual found to have ever used a drug that could cause
flashbacks (hallucinogens such as LSD, mescaline, etc.) is ineligible for PRP duties. In addition,
any individual who has ever used peyote is ineligible for PRP duties, including those individuals
otherwise protected under Public Law 103-344 (42 U.S.C. section 1996a) of title 42,U.S.C.
(Reference (nu)).

            C5.1.2.1.8. It is not the intent of this Regulation to automatically disqualify or
decertify any individual from PRP who, in an effort to self-medicate, inadvertently or
deliberately exceeds the recommended safe dosage on the medication’s packaging of over-the-
counter substances or who improperly uses prescribed medications. If the certifying official
suspects or the individual admits to such improper usage, the individual must be suspended from
PRP duties and the CMA consulted. If a CMA diagnosis of drug abuse is rendered, the
certifying official shall permanently decertify the individual.

        C5.1.2.2. Drug Abuse. Any individual diagnosed as a drug abuser will not be certified
into the PRP or, if certified, will be permanently decertified, and those actions will be made a
matter of permanent record such that the person cannot be transferred to another location/unit
and become PRP certified.

        C5.1.2.3. Drug Dependency. Any individual diagnosed as drug dependent will not be
certified into the PRP or, if certified, will be permanently decertified, and those actions will be
made a matter of permanent record such that the person cannot be transferred to another
location/unit and become PRP certified.

        C5.1.2.4. Pre-Service Drug Use. Pre-service use of marijuana, hashish, or other
cannabis-based product does not necessarily render an individual ineligible for consideration for,
or retention in, a PRP position. It is incumbent on the certifying official, with CMA
consultation, to determine the degree that the pre-service drug use impacts the reliability of the
individual being considered.

            C5.1.2.4.1. It is not the intention of this Regulation to render automatically ineligible
for the PRP all individuals who are or have been in the program after disclosing pre-Service or
in-Service cannabis use and who, before May 25, 1993, were certified according to the PRP
certification rules of their Service DoD Component that were in effect at the time of their first
certification in which this use was considered during the PRP certification process. Further, if
individuals were certified at a time when the Services did not require disclosure of cannabis use,
and they subsequently made such disclosure, this disclosure will not be the sole reason for
decertification.

             C5.1.2.4.2. If the pre-Service cannabis use is discovered after an individual is already
certified, and there is no other information that would cause doubt about the individual’s
reliability, the certifying official, with CMA consultation, may retain the individual in the PRP.

    C5.1.3. Other Substances. Use of any other substances that alter perceptions or mental
faculties including sniffing glue or aerosol fumes, shall be handled as drug incidents, abuse or
dependence, respectively, as determined after consultation with the CMA.

    C5.1.4. Negligence or Delinquency in Performance of Duty. If the certifying official’s
review of the PRP candidate’s or certified member’s job or duty history reveals a lack of
dependability, flexibility, good attitude or good judgment, the member should not be certified, or
should be decertified. In determining reliability, the certifying official must evaluate all aspects
of an individual’s actions.

    C5.1.5. Conviction of, or Involvement in, a Serious Incident. Conviction by a military or
civil court of a serious offense, including both felonies and misdemeanors, or involvement in a
serious incident, or a pattern of behavior or conduct that is reasonably indicative of a
contemptuous attitude toward the law or other duly constituted authority.

    C5.1.6. Medical Condition. Any significant physical or mental condition substantiated by
the CMA to be prejudicial to reliable performance of the duties of a particular critical or
controlled position. The certifying official shall take the necessary actions to ensure that the
individual is properly screened both medically and psychologically. Individuals who experience
personal trauma, including but not limited to such events as family illness/death, violent crime,
to include sexual assault or accidental injury, may experience psychological symptoms that
impact reliability. When individuals affected by personal trauma seek medical care, the CMA
will assess potential impact upon reliability, and advise the CO accordingly. The CMA is not
required to disclose the personal circumstances that resulted in trauma, but are required to inform
the CO of the specific medical/psychological diagnosis and treatment that may potentially impact
reliability. As with all potentially disqualifying medical conditions, the certifying official must
decide each case on the specific medical and other pertinent evaluations of the individual
involved. The primary consideration in all determinations must be in the best interest of national
security.

    C5.1.7. Poor Attitude or Lack of Motivation. Poor attitude or lack of motivation as
evidenced by aberrant attitude or irrational behavior, inappropriate behavior or mood may be
grounds for decertification.

    C5.1.8. Suicide Attempt and/or Threats. Any suicide attempt and/or threat may be grounds
for disqualification or decertification. In determining reliability, the certifying official must
evaluate all aspects of the individual’s action. Any suspected attempt and/or threat of suicide
will result in the individual’s temporary decertification from PRP duties pending the results of a
mental health assessment/evaluation.
DoD5210.42-R_AFMAN13-501 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                          57


    C5.1.9. Loss of Confidence. If for any reason the certifying official loses trust or confidence
in a member’s ability to perform PRP duties, the certifying official shall decertify the member.
(Added)(AF) An individual involuntarily discharged, removed for cause, or whose
employment was terminated and the CO lost trust and confidence in that individual’s
ability to perform PRP duties. Documentation will be completed prior to discharge,
removal or termination.

     C5.1.10. (Added)(AF) Security Clearance. Individuals will be temporarily decertified
if a Security Information File is established, if access to classified information has been
withdrawn, or if a suspended security clearance eligibility in JPAS that reflects “pending
due process” by the DoD CAF/AF Division, or a revocation or denial of eligibility by the
DSS for contractor personnel. Individuals will be suspended if security clearance
reinvestigation has not been submitted to OPM by the 5 year mark.

C5.2. SUSPENSION

Suspension is used to immediately remove a member from PRP duties without starting
decertification action. When suspended, a member is still considered reliable for the PRP, but
because of the circumstances, is not authorized to perform PRP duties. Although a
recommendation to suspend an individual from PRP duties may come from many sources, the
certifying official must evaluate the situation and determine whether suspension is appropriate.

    C5.2.1. Suspension shall be used only when the individual’s reliability is not in question,
when the problem is expected to be of short duration, and while conducting an investigation or
medical evaluation to determine if a situation or incident could have an adverse effect on an
individual’s reliability.

    C5.2.2. A suspension requires that the certifying official remove the individual from duties
requiring PRP certification, notify the individual and his or her supervisor of the nature and
circumstances about the suspension. A suspension will initially be for up to 30 days. However,
the certifying official may extend the period of suspension up to 120 days in 30-day increments,
when there is insufficient information to either remove the suspension or return the individual to
PRP duties or to either temporarily or permanently decertify the member. If the issue cannot be
resolved, or if the cause of the suspension lasts longer than 120 days, the individual shall be
temporarily decertified until the issue is resolved and the individual is either returned to PRP
duties or permanently decertified. (Added)(AF) Use appropriate channels to notify entry
control authorities of all suspensions.

   C5.2.3. (Added)(AF) Documentation. Use the AF Form 164 or locally devised system to
track and remove all suspensions as soon as the CO makes a determination.

   C5.2.4. (Added)(AF) A CO who is suspended may perform PRP administrative
functions (e.g., qualification/certification, suspension, temp decertification and permanent
disqualification/decertification actions).

C5.3. DECERTIFICATION

Any individual who fails to meet the reliability standards specified in this Regulation shall not be
assigned to, or continued in, duties of a PRP position. PRP certification shall be revoked
immediately on a certifying official’s determination that an individual no longer meets the
standards in this Regulation. The certification shall terminate administratively when an
individual transfers from a PRP position to one not requiring certification. There are two types:

     C5.3.1. Temporary Decertification

        C5.3.1.1. Temporary decertification from PRP duties shall occur immediately on receipt
of information that is, or appears to be, a reason for decertification from the PRP. That action
shall be taken when the certifying official has information that could be expected to affect an
individual’s job performance or reliability and suspension is not appropriate. Temporary
decertification shall not be used if the facts dictate permanent decertification. When temporarily
decertified, the individual may not perform PRP duties. Within 15 workdays of the temporary
decertification, the certifying official shall provide the individual in writing the reason(s) for
temporary decertification unless the individual is returned earlier to PRP duties. Individuals
temporarily decertified will remain under continuous evaluation for PRP purposes until
permanently decertified or returned to PRP duties. (Added)(AF) Remove individual’s access
and notify entry control authorities through appropriate channels.

       C5.3.1.2. The certifying official shall investigate all information essential to a decision
about revoking the temporary decertification or invoking a permanent decertification. During
suspected alcohol or drug abuse, the investigation shall include a medical evaluation by the
CMA.

        C5.3.1.3. Temporary decertification shall not normally exceed 270 days. However, the
certifying official may extend the period of temporary decertification in 30-day increments to a
maximum of 365 days. Extensions shall be documented. (Added)(AF) Document extensions
using the AF Form 164 or a locally devised system to track and remove as soon as the CO
makes a determination. Ensure temporary decertification is resolved or the individual is
permanently decertified prior to reassignment to a non-PRP position, permanent change of
station, separation, discharge processing, or reassignment/termination of employment for
contractor personnel. If individual is permanently decertified ensure this reason is stated
in the remarks of the AF Form 286A. Note: Ensure remarks are in compliance with
HIPAA and Privacy Act policies.

    C5.3.2. Permanent Decertification. Individuals who the certifying official determines to no
longer meet the reliability standards specified in this Regulation shall be permanently decertified.
Within 15 workdays of the determination, the certifying official shall advise the individual, in
writing, of the reasons for decertification and of the requirement for review by the reviewing
official. (Added)(AF) This includes Permanent Disqualification.
DoD5210.42-R_AFMAN13-501 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                          59


        C5.3.2.1. Any of the following four conditions shall result in permanent decertification
or, if an individual is being considered for a PRP position, permanent disqualification:

              C5.3.2.1.1. An individual who is diagnosed as alcohol dependent and
subsequently fails the required aftercare program.

               C5.3.2.1.2. An individual who is diagnosed as a drug abuser.

               C5.3.2.1.3. An individual who is diagnosed as drug dependent.

               C5.3.2.1.4. An individual’s security clearance is revoked.

        C5.3.2.2. To ensure uniform application of the reliability standards specified by this
Regulation and effective use of personnel, consistent with the purpose of the PRP, a reviewing
official shall review each case involving a permanent decertification decision. The reviewing
official may seek additional information or explanations of extenuating circumstances from the
certifying official, the CMA, personnel officials, and the individual concerned, if appropriate.
(Added)(AF) This also applies to permanent disqualifications decisions.

        C5.3.2.3. Following the review of the permanent decertification action, the reviewing
official shall notify the individual and the certifying official of the findings and conclusion
within 15 workdays. In the case of a DoD contractor employee, the contractor shall be told only
that the employee has been decertified and must be reassigned to non-PRP duties in compliance
with contractual requirements. (Added)(AF) This also applies to permanent disqualification
actions.

        C5.3.2.4. If the reviewing official approves the permanent decertification, the individual
shall be removed from positions requiring PRP certification and the action shall be made a
matter of permanent record. (Added)(AF) This also includes permanent disqualification.
Document the permanent disqualification/decertification using the AF Form 286A.
Forward the AF Form 286A to AFPC or ARPC PRP processing utilizing CMS or a suitable
substitute. Maintain an electronic copy on file until the original is verified and filed in the
individual’s automated record. If the RO disapproves the permanent
disqualification/decertification, the case file and AF Form 286A are destroyed. Update
PDS with the applicable PRP status code (date RO signed AF Form 286A).


C5.4. REINSTATEMENT/REQUALIFICATION

    C5.4.1. A certifying official or reviewing official may request reinstatement of a member’s
PRP certification or requalification consideration for members who were permanently
decertified/disqualified provided the reason or condition of the permanent decertification or
ineligibility no longer exists. Approval authority for reinstatement is Head of a DoD
Component. Each Head of a DoD Component shall determine delegation authority within their
Component. Requests for reinstatement or requalification must be in writing, contain
justification and information as determined by Service directives. If reinstatement or

requalification is approved, initial qualification/screening shall be completed as described earlier
in this Regulation.

    C5.4.2. Individuals permanently disqualified or decertified for alcohol dependency may be
reinstated/requalified for PRP duties under the following conditions:

            C5.4.2.1. The individual has successfully completed an initial intensive
rehabilitation, according to Reference (mt).

            C5.4.2.2. The individual has completed a 1-year period of strict compliance with
aftercare program requirements according to Reference (mt).

           C5.4.2.3. In all cases a PRP qualification screening including a favorable prognosis
by the CMA and a psychological evaluation shall be completed before requesting reinstatement.
(Added)(AF) Psychological evaluation will be accomplished by a credentialed provider
(psychiatrist, psychologist or social worker).

             C5.4.2.4. The responsible certifying official must determine that the value of the
member’s continued presence in the PRP outweighs the risk from potential future alcohol-related
incidents and must document the fact that he or she has full trust and confidence in the member’s
reliability.

    C5.4.3. (Added)(AF) Forward requests to reinstate PRP eligibility to AF/A10-F for
approval (see C2.1.). The request will include the chain of command recommendations
(including CMA, and any specialist consultations if health-related, CO, RO, MAJCOM
SGP if health related, and MAJCOM PRP) and all documentation that substantiated the
permanent decertification or disqualification, and documentation that support the opinion
that the condition or reason no longer exists. NOTE: Ensure request cases are in
compliance with Privacy Act and HIPAA policies.


C5.5. (Added)(AF) APPEAL

    C5.5.1. (Added)(AF) An individual may appeal a PRP permanent disqualification/
decertification (see C2.1.). Individuals must provide a written request for an appeal, with
rationale and supporting evidence. Forward all appeal requests to AF/A10-F for approval
or disapproval. The request will include the chain of command recommendations
(including CMA and any specialist consultations if health-related, CO, RO, MAJCOM
SGP if health related, and MAJCOM PRP) and all documentation that substantiated the
permanent disqualification or decertification. NOTE: Ensure requests are in compliance
with the Privacy Act and HIPAA policies.

                                         PRP POSITIONS


AP1.1. GENERAL

The reliability standards established in Chapter 3 shall be used to determine an individual’s
eligibility for a PRP position. All PRP positions shall be formally designated as either critical or
controlled and shall be restricted to the minimum number required to accomplish the mission.
Only certified personnel shall be assigned to designated PRP positions and when PRP positions
become vacant, certified personnel shall be assigned as rapidly as possible. Examples of typical
PRP positions are shown in Table AP1.T1., below.


AP1.2. REVIEW OF PRP POSITIONS

Certifying officials shall re-evaluate designated PRP positions annually to determine the need for
additional positions or the cancellation of unnecessary positions.

   AP1.2.1. (Added)(AF) MANPOWER POSITION CODING. The following manpower
designators shall be used when identifying PRP coded manpower billets:

     A – CRITICAL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PRP
     D – CONTROL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PRP

     I – CONTROL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PRP (NUCLEAR EXPERIENCE REQ)
     N – CRITICAL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PRP (NUCLEAR EXPERIENCE REQ)

    AP1.2.2. (Added)(AF) ADDITIONAL DUTY. In some cases, the CO may be required
to certify personnel for PRP additional duty. Certify those selected for PRP additional
duty according to this Regulation and Supplement, but do not document these
requirements on the Unit Manning Document.

   AP1.2.3. (Added) (AF) CIVILIAN POSITIONS. Government civilian positions which
require PRP certification will be identified on the Unit Manning Document as a PRP
position and the position description will include PRP duties.

    AP1.2.4. (Added)(AF) CONTRACTOR PRP POSITIONS. Because of the diversity of
position titles and duties in the Air Force, the reliability standards established in this
instruction will be used to determine which positions will be identified for PRP. The COs
formally designate PRP positions as either “critical” or “controlled” and keep positions to
the minimum required to accomplish the mission. This requirement will be met during
contract establishment.
      DoD5210.42-R_AFMAN13-501 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                  63


          AP1.2.5. (Added)(AF) CONVERTING POSITIONS. Prior to converting military or
      DoD civilian PRP coded positions to civilian contractor positions, the functions to be
      converted must be deemed required and essential by AF/A10. This determination must be
      made and approval granted, in writing, prior to nominating the function for contract
      performance.

      AP1.3. PRP POSITION ELIGIBILITY

      Eligibility for assignment to PRP positions, subject to the reliability standards in Chapter 3, shall
      be confirmed in writing by a certifying official. Before an individual is assigned to PRP duties,
      it shall be certified that the individual has had the required PSI and clearance, been screened
      according to the reliability standards, been personally interviewed by the certifying official, and
      been found eligible and qualified for assignment to a PRP position.
