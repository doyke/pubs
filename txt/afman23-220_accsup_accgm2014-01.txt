      B. Gains and losses of classified items, regardless of dollar value.

      C. Gains and losses of pilferable items with extended cost equal to or greater than $2,500.

      D. Losses with extended cost equal to or greater than $50,000.

      E. ROS is not mandatory for CIC 7 assets unless extended cost is equal to or greater than
      $50,000.

      F. Any loss when there is an indication or suspicion of fraud, theft or negligence.

      G. Repetitive losses when the cumulative dollar value of the inventory losses equals or
      exceeds the projected cost of the financial liability investigation.

      H. Bulk petroleum when the loss exceeds the stated allowance.
2. Any other mandatory requirements in DoD 7000.14-R not listed in this GM will also apply.
3. Sensitive, Classified, and Pilferable items are identified by controlled inventory item code
listed in DoD 4100.39-M, Volume 10, Table 61.
