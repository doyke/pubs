1. Purpose. This Wing Instruction will define the function of the Air Force Distributed
Common Ground System (DCGS) Analysis and Reporting Team (DART). This Wing
Instruction is meant to provide a baseline for the 480 ISR WG DARTs (i.e. It is not mandating
every Group to have a Request for Information (RFI) process or to conduct Ground Moving
 2                                                          480ISRWI14-101 14 AUGUST 2012


Target Indicator (GMTI) (as examples); however, if a group does execute an RFI process or
utilizes GMTI, the Wing Instruction applies).
2. Background. The 480 ISR WG wrote this Wing Instruction in response to a need to establish
baseline guidance for all the DARTs across the Wing.
3. DART Mission and Role. The DART performs tactical/operational analysis derived from
organic DCGS assets to improve the quality, responsiveness, and relevance of intelligence
reporting of the AF DCGS AN/GSQ-272 SENTINEL weapon system through collaborative,
fused, all-source multi-sensor analysis. The DART correlates and fuses data to support DCGS
crews and Supported Units (S/Us) throughout every phase of DCGS operations. Additionally, it
fuses DCGS-derived information with other available intelligence data from non-DCGS sources
to produce higher-confidence reports and enhance both internal and external support. Two types
of mission function of the DART include support to internal and external customers, as described
below:
     3.1. Internal Support. Internal mission crew support is defined as building situational
     awareness by providing current intelligence to crews and leadership (reference section six for
     additional information on DART products). The DART will also manage formal (e.g. intel
     portion of the Pre-Mission Brief [PMB]) and informal (e.g. crew questions) tasked
     requirements.
     3.2. External Support. The DART provides external support to ensure requirements are
     satisfied and to obtain operations details and produce tailored products (e.g. feeding S/U’s
     operational planning, satisfying RFIs, etc.). Maintaining coordination with external entities
     serves to manage formal (e.g. RFIs) and informal (e.g. Joint Terminal Attack Controller
     [JTAC] request via Internet Relay Chat [mIRC]) tasked requirements in order to maximize
     collection, processing, and exploitation capacity.
Figure 3.1: DART Support Functions.




4. DART Tasks.
     4.1. Mission Type Orders (MTOs). The Fusion Lead, internal DCGS role, (reference
     paragraph 4.5) will ensure S/U ISR Liaison Officers (ISRLOs) and Collection Managers
     understand DART’s assigned capability to satisfy MTOs and ensure the Wing Operations
480ISRWI14-101 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                  3


   Center (WOC), DCGS Liaison Officer (LNO) and ISRLOs are aware of the overall plan to
   support the MTO. The Fusion Lead is responsible for working with the respective Mission
   Planning Cell (MPC) to develop agreements with the assigned assets (for collection
   requirements) and sister Distributed Ground Systems (DGSs) (for Collection, Processing,
   Exploitation, and Dissemination [CPED] requirements) and the WOC (for allocation and
   apportionment).
   4.2. Request for Information (RFI). S/Us send RFIs to the agency they believe can answer
   their request. RFIs sent to the DCGS are dealt with internally or deferred. An RFI is defined
   as any specific direct support request/requirement for AF-DCGS intelligence information or
   products to support an ongoing crisis or operation not necessarily related to standing
   requirements or scheduled intelligence production. The DARTs are responsible for
   coordinating and deconflicting with the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
   Division (ISRD) and Joint/National agencies for their respective Area of Operations (AO)
   Fusion Leads. RFIs requiring long-term analysis (beyond eight days) or that which the
   DART is incapable of answering, will be declined or deferred to another appropriate agency
   and may be handled via a more formal RFI process.
      4.2.1. Outside of the DCGS DART RFI Boundaries. Requests outside of the established
      criteria or capability will be declined or deferred. Possible appropriate organizations are
      listed below:

   4.3. Support to Crews. DARTs will provide crew support to include content for PMBs and
   Current Intelligence Briefings (CIBs) to the MPC and crew members. The DART can
 4                                                          480ISRWI14-101 14 AUGUST 2012


     provide operations highlight slides, Keyhole Markup Language (KML) files, and deep dive
     studies to crews. DARTs will support crews by providing situational awareness; both short-
     term (tactical) historical analysis and real-time analysis to crews during operations.
     4.4. Support to Leadership. DARTs shall provide AF DCGS leadership intelligence
     briefings and ISR roll-ups. The DART can also provide some of the same products and
     support as mentioned above; again the main purpose is to provide situational awareness to
     leadership as well as operational issues (good and bad) and identify lessons learned.
     4.5. Fusion Leads.
        4.5.1. In accordance with AFTTP 3-1.DCGS and the AF DCGS PED Special
        Instructions (SPINS), the DART when assigned as DGS Fusion Lead, will establish and
        maintain ongoing relationships with S/Us, mission partners, and ISRLOs to maximize
        ISR capabilities to provide higher confidence reporting. DARTs will develop AO
        expertise to provide continuity and analysis for assigned AOs and named operations.
        4.5.2. During mission execution, the DGS Fusion Lead shall coordinate with the
        applicable Command, Control, Communication (C3) Lead to provide baseline support.
        The Fusion Lead will gather current information and intelligence updates for PMBs,
        overlays, and reports (reference section 6) that are within current operational capability.
        By request, Fusion Lead sites will provide additional products to fill S/U’s desired effects
        (e.g. ISR Mission Summaries). Fusion Lead will tailor products for rapid consumption
        and integration of intelligence in order to optimally assist the existing S/U intelligence
        element. When tasked with an MTO, the Fusion Lead will coordinate all-source
        intelligence production requirements as it applies to the MTO.
        4.5.3. During the post-mission debrief the DGS Fusion Lead may request feedback from
        the C3 Lead on mission planning effectiveness concerning Fusion Lead production and
        support.
5. DART interaction with Mission Planning Cell (MPC).
     5.1. The DART and MPC will interact during all phases of the DCGS Operational Planning
     Process (DOPP). The DART shall keep the MPC informed of any RFIs/intelligence gaps
     that need to be satisfied. The DART should provide all-source intelligence of the operational
     environment to the MPC for inclusion in mission planning and the PMB. The MPC shall
     inform the DART of all pre-determined arrangements (e.g. ISR agreements, Cross-Cueing
     opportunities, etc.) for mission execution. The DART shall provide analytical support to
     optimize additional collection opportunities to satisfy ongoing operations. DART operators
     will be responsible for outreach to S/U and filter any emerging requirements to the MPC,
     which will assess collection possibilities and provide feedback to the DART operators.
     5.2. The MPC and DART will collaboratively gather feedback from S/Us to capture lessons
     learned and best practices from the mission execution phase. The DART will provide
     feedback to the MPC on the mission planning and mission execution phases to capture
     lessons learned and best practices, as well as document any issues to be resolved (especially
     unsatisfied requirements or significant intelligence/events from the mission).
480ISRWI14-101 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                  5

               noted Signal Operating Instructions (SOI) recoveries
    6.3. Digital Overlays. A digital overlay (shape, KML, draw file, etc.) is a product that
    displays geospatial information or intelligence with DGS baseline applications. Digital
    overlays produced by the DART are used to graphically depict real-time intelligence data,
    activity, and references, while meeting S/U desired effects.
    6.4. Air Force DCGS Analysis Report (AFDAR). The AFDAR is a by-request or event-
    triggered tailored all-source product. The AFDAR can be used to answer customer requests
    for fused products such as an RFI (see section 4). An AFDAR production requirement can
    be generated either internally or externally. AFDAR dissemination guidance is spelled out in
    the customer request; it will include e-mail dissemination to all relevant parties including, the
    requestor, DCGS players, DCGS LNO and for contingency operations, the appropriate
    regional command liaison officer.
    6.5. All Source EYELID Report (ASER). The ASER is produced by the DART to
    substantiate EYELIDs into higher confidence reporting. An ASER can be an all-source
480ISRWI14-101 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                7


   product and is designed to give ground forces situational awareness of a possible Improvised
   Explosive Device (IED)-related threat discovered during mission execution. SIGINT or
   Human Intelligence (HUMINT) will not be the sole source for IED reporting, but can be
   leveraged for potential cross-cue opportunity.
   6.6. Quick Look. The Quick Look is a by-request, graphical representation of the Post-
   Mission Summary (PMS) for situational awareness. It is particularly useful when supporting
   a Scheme of Maneuver (SOM).
   6.7. Storyboards. The storyboard is a product designed to highlight a significant event
   occurring during a given mission. Two standardized examples are vehicle and mission
   storyboards. Descriptions of these specific storyboards can be found in the AFTTP 3-1
   DCGS.
   6.8. Gridded Reference Graphics (GRGs). GRGs provided by the DART should meet S/U’s
   intent; GRGs consist of graphical representations of a fixed target area, providing a visual
   index of all structures in a target area.
   6.9. SIGINT Tactical Analysis Report (STAR). The STAR provides a graphical portrayal of
   DGS collection for SIGINT missions. Descriptions of the STAR can be found in the AFTTP
   3-1 DCGS.
7. Crew Positions/Roles within the DART.
   7.1. Senior Correlation Analyst (SCAN). The SCAN supervises DART operations and is
   directly subordinate to the Mission Operations Commander (MOC) or Mission Director, as
   appropriate. The SCAN will assign Mission Support Analysts (MSAs) and Correlation
   Analysts (CANs) to support missions IAW the PED Tasking Order (PTO) and the Crew
   Manning Letter (CML). The SCAN will ensure all reports/tasks are completed/closed,
   ensure all necessary and mandatory information is annotated in the pass-down binder, and
   ensure quality checks are performed on products and reports completed by DART analysts.
   The SCAN will ensure observed/detected order-of-battle updates are briefed in context to the
   DART crew and provided to mission crews. The SCAN or appointed delegate will attend
   post-mission debriefs, submit any suggestions for improvement to mission support flights
   (e.g. DOK, DOT, DOM, etc.) and lead changeover with incoming crew.
   7.2. Correlation Analyst (CAN). The CAN, directly subordinate to the MOC or SCAN,
   correlates multi-INT (e.g. Geospatial Intelligence [GEOINT], Measurement and Signature
   Intelligence [MASINT], SIGINT, Open Source Intelligence [OSINT], etc.) data during
   mission operations. The CAN is the focal point for internal/external ad hoc collection
   taskings, aids the MOC in maintaining situational awareness and disseminates correlated
   intelligence to external intelligence consumers. The CAN will establish and maintain fluid
   communication with the MOC, Ground Mission Supervisor (GMS), Imagery Mission
   Supervisor (IMS), and DART personnel.
   7.3. Mission Support Analyst (MSA). The MSA, subordinate to the SCAN or CAN
   (depending on local guidance), conducts mission specific intelligence research and tactical
   trend analysis in support of AF DCGS crews. The MSA shall maintain situational awareness
   of current AO activity. MSAs shall review applicable documents (e.g. Intelligence
   Summaries [INTSUMS], Daily Intelligence Summaries [DISUMS], etc.) for the previous Air
   Tasking Order (ATO) day, identify common enemy Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
 8                                                        480ISRWI14-101 14 AUGUST 2012


     (TTPs), important operations, and anything else relevant for maintaining crew’s SA. MSAs
     shall contact respective S/U and refine requirements in order to provide the proper level of
     support. The MSA will fuse intelligence from other analysts, as dictated by S/U
     requirements, and develop an assessment. If the CAN is unavailable, the MSA shall
     integrate intelligence derived within the DGS or at other intelligence units to generate
     AFDARs and other applicable DART products.
NOTE: Operational groups can add additional crew positions as they deem necessary to satisfy
S/U requirements. These positions are not official Wing positions and will be manned out of
current Group assets.
8. DART Interaction with Intelligence Mission Partners (when applicable):
     8.1. Air National Guard (ANG). The DART coordinates and collaborates with the DGS
     ANG sites, supporting them by providing Fusion products, KMLs, and mission related
     intelligence. The DART will coordinate using email, Internet Relay Chat (mIRC), and other
     means of communication. The 480 ISR WG shall include the DGS ANG sites in all
     Operational Synchronization (Op Syncs) Video Tele-Conferences (VTCs); ensuring that the
     Wing Fusion Leads pass applicable operational information to the Guard Sites.
     8.2. Distributed Mission Site (DMS). The DARTs shall interact with DMS sites to pull AO
     or INT-specific expertise and incorporate into Fusion Lead AO knowledge.
Interaction with a DMS is mission dependent and therefore may be used for situational
awareness purposes. DMS-NASIC is the established entry point for leveraging technical
expertise.
     8.3. National Tactical Integration (NTI). The DARTs shall collaborate with NTIs to
     incorporate national SIGINT, receive historical data, and increase Fusion Lead AO
     knowledge for situational awareness. NTIs provide DARTs with intelligence from National
     databases that may not be provided by DMS sites. NTI can be used to further collaborate
     with the Air Operations Center (AOC) ISRD.
     8.4. Intelligence Community (IC) (i.e. NGA, NGIC, DIA, NSA, Theater JACs/JICs, etc.)
     and Specialty Centers (Joint IED Defeat Organization - JIEDDO, etc.). The DARTs shall
     collaborate as appropriate with the IC and Specialty Centers for DART products and
     situational awareness.
     8.5. ISR Division (ISRD-AOC). The DARTs will coordinate with the ISRD when mission
     operations requirements dictate, in order to maintain and provide situational awareness. The
     DARTs are responsible for coordination and deconfliction with the ISRD during the RFI
     process.
480ISRWI14-101 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                9



9. Other DART Capabilities (DGS-dependent).
   9.1. Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI). GMTI will be used as an additive fusion
   layer of intelligence data, with the goal of enhancing SA of DGS crews in order to provide
   higher confidence products to the S/U. DCGS personnel will not create GMTI specific
   products; only add GMTI data to existing fusion products. GMTI trained analysts will utilize
   whatever mission tool(s) best accomplish Phase 1 GMTI exploitation and correlation
   objectives.
