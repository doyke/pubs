                                            Chapter 3

                          EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING

3.1. Introduction. There are two types of EIT: Aircrew Intelligence Training (AIT) and Force
Protection Intelligence Training (FPIT). AIT will be coordinated with the wing/group tactics
flight or officer. FPIT will be coordinated with force protection (FP) organizations (e.g., Security
Forces (SF), Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI)) as defined in AFI 14-119,
Intelligence Support to Force Protection (FP). (T-2)
3.2. The SIO will:
     3.2.1. Establish an EIT program tailored to the unit’s mission, weapons systems, projected
     wartime/Air and Space Expeditionary Force tasking and base/deployment location(s). (T-2)
     3.2.2. Appoint in writing an EIT program manager to oversee program execution. (T-3)
     3.2.3. Assign only qualified trainers to conduct unsupervised EIT events. Specialized
     training requirements and evaluation criteria for EIT trainers are identified in AFI 14-2U-2,
     Volumes 1 and 2. (T-3)
     3.2.4. Develop written guidance outlining procedures for conducting, documenting, testing,
     evaluating, monitoring and reporting EIT. List specific training objectives for each major
     area of intelligence training and the training method and resources used to satisfy each
     objective. (T-3)
     3.2.5. Coordinate EIT written instructions with all applicable commanders. Written
     guidance will be coordinated with any agency that assists intelligence personnel in providing
     training, as well as, any agency for which intelligence training is provided on a regularly
     scheduled basis. (T-3)
     3.2.6. Determine if other unit personnel require EIT and modify training requirements as
     appropriate. (T-3)
3.3. The EIT program manager will:
     3.3.1. Build an effective training program, including training plans, with input from
     operational squadrons, tactics representatives, aircrew flight equipment (AFE) personnel, SF
     personnel, AFOSI, and Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) specialists, as
     appropriate. (T-2)
        3.3.1.1. Effective training methods will be used and can include, but are not limited to:
        briefings, demonstration-performance, formal and informal lectures, and academic
        training sessions.
        3.3.1.2. Training resources can include, but are not limited to: threat briefings, current
        intelligence briefings, theater orientation briefings, CDs/DVDs or web-based training
        materials, and weapons system videos.
     3.3.2. Review training objectives for currency prior to the beginning of the training cycle.
     (T-3)
     3.3.3. Actively solicit feedback to ensure training objectives are meeting training
     requirements. (T-3)
AFI14-2U-2V3 13 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                  9


   3.3.4. Conduct trend analysis following each training cycle; document lessons learned and
   apply those lessons during subsequent cycles. (T-3)
   3.3.5. Provide a written evaluation of the wing/group EIT program to the appropriate
   commander(s) at the end of each training cycle. The written evaluation will include at a
   minimum: the percent or number of personnel trained; trend analysis (e.g., high miss
   questions, weak areas); and corrective actions taken. Incorporate feedback as applicable. (T-
   3)
3.4. Aircrew Intelligence Training. AIT is EIT provided to the units’ assigned and attached
pilots. The assigned Intelligence Weapons Instructor Course (IWIC) or Intelligence Sensor and
Weapons Instructors Course (ISWIC) graduate will be directly responsible for the management
of the AIT program. When an IWIC or ISWIC graduate is not assigned, the SIO will manage the
AIT program.
   3.4.1. Flying squadron intelligence personnel provide input to and execute the AIT program.
   They will provide questions and answers specific to the squadron's mission for the unit
   master question file (MQF), administer AIT tests to pilots at the end of each training cycle,
   and document AIT provided. Documentation of AIT will include the names of personnel
   receiving training, date training was accomplished, the topic taught, and the name of the
   trainer conducting the training. In addition, they will provide a written evaluation of the
   squadron’s AIT program to the squadron commander and the EIT program manager (see
   Attachment 5). (T-3)
   3.4.2. The AIT plan will be specifically tailored to meet unit/mission requirements. Each
   item in the AIT training plan will be taught at least once during the training cycle. The plan
   will ensure the objectives for each AIT category outlined in the paragraphs below are
   evaluated with a test. All pilots covered by the training plan will pass each test with a
   minimum score of 85% correctable to 100% via a review of the missed test items with a
   qualified trainer. (T-3)
   3.4.3. Prorate training based on unit contingency operations tempo IAW AFI 11-2U-2,
   Volume 1. Details of the prorating schedule must be outlined in the AIT Plan and/or other
   written instructions. (T-3)
   3.4.4. Pilot intelligence training categories include: threat knowledge, personnel recovery
   (PR), and collection and reporting (which also includes the Air Force Distributed Common
   Ground System (DCGS)). Additional categories can be added based on the unit’s operational
   mission.
       3.4.4.1. Threat Knowledge Training. Develop specific threat knowledge training
       objectives tailored to the U-2, unit mission, local area, deployment base(s) and forward
       operating locations. Concentrate on threats in selected countries with the potential for
       direct unit involvement. The minimum standards for U-2 AIT threat briefings are in
       attachment 3. The references listed may be supplemented with other classified and
       unclassified publications such as National Air and Space Intelligence Center products,
       Tactics Bulletins, Tactics Analysis Reports, Country Studies, etc. when developing threat
       knowledge training materials.
       3.4.4.2. Personnel Recovery Operational Support Training. When assigned, a SERE
       specialist will conduct PR operational support training. The SERE specialist will
 10                                                      AFI14-2U-2V3 13 NOVEMBER 2012


       coordinate PR operations support training requirements with intelligence and AFE
       personnel and document these requirements in a memorandum of agreement (MOA).
       Units without SERE personnel will coordinate an MOA with AFE and operations. This
       category will be omitted if intelligence personnel do not provide any PR operational
       support training to pilots. If intelligence personnel do provide PR operational support
       training, address as a minimum: PR materials (e.g., Isolated Personnel Report
       (ISOPREP) maintenance and review, evasion plan of action (EPA) preparation) and
       theater combat recovery procedures.
       3.4.4.3. Collection and Reporting Training. Collection and reporting training will focus
       on items necessary to enable pilots to initiate pilot-originated reports (e.g., In-flight
       Report (INFLTREP)) and familiarize them with the information requirements of the
       intelligence-generated Mission Report (MISREP) and other intelligence reports. A
       critical component of this training will be the unit’s essential elements of information
       (EEIs). Training will identify and describe theater-specific and peacetime reporting
       requirements. Training will also provide pilots insight to AF DCGS operations with
       emphasis on roles and responsibilities, crew communication and coordination between
       pilots and AF DCGS.
3.5. Force Protection Intelligence Training. FPIT is EIT provided by the host unit
intelligence function to the unit’s SF and other FP support agencies (e.g., AFOSI, Civil
Engineering). FPIT will be conducted IAW AFI 14-119 and supporting documents. When
possible, a Force Protection Intelligence Formal Training Unit graduate will be responsible for
the management of the FPIT program. If the intelligence function is not part of the host unit, the
tenant unit responsibilities in AFI 14-119 will be adhered to.
   3.5.1. The FPIT plan will ensure FPIT is conducted IAW AFI 14-119 and will be
   specifically tailored to meet unit/mission FP requirements. Each item in the FPIT training
   plan will be taught IAW the FP customers objectives. (T-3)
   3.5.2. All FPIT will be documented to include the names of personnel receiving training,
   date training was accomplished, the topic taught, and the name of the trainer conducting the
   training. In addition, provide a written evaluation of the FPIT program to the appropriate
   unit commander and the EIT program manager. (T-3)
   3.5.3. FPIT categories include intelligence roles and responsibilities, area of responsibility
   (AOR) hotspots, hostile forces, ground threat, landmines and improvised explosive devices.
   Additional categories can be added based on the unit’s operational mission. FPIT will meet
   the standards found in attachment 4. (T-3)
