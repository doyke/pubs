This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-16, Air Force Studies,
Analyses, Assessments and Lessons Learned. It provides guidance for the Air Force Lessons
Learned Program (AFLLP) to include developing standards for major activities under the Air
Force Lessons Process (AFLP). It covers all activities associated with lessons learned (LL)
support for operations, exercise, and wargame after action reports (AARs) as well as other LL
activities. This instruction guides AF positions to the Joint Lessons Learned Program (JLLP)
and the joint community on LL matters. This instruction applies to all Air Force military,
civilian, and contractor personnel, including the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard
(ANG). This Air Force Instruction (AFI) may be supplemented by Air Force Major Commands
(MAJCOMs) or other subordinate levels, but must be coordinated with AF/A9L prior to
approval. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of
command. Requests for waivers must be submitted through the chain of command to the
appropriate Tier waiver approval authority. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW the Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule located in the Air Force Records Information Management
System . The use of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial product,
commodity, or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The revision is more
closely aligned with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3150.25E,
Joint Lessons Learned Program, to include the use of the Joint/Army/Marine Corps/Navy
accepted acronym terminology for lessons learned as LL versus the previous use by AF/A9 of
the stand-alone acronym terminology for lessons learned of L2. The revision includes
instructions for identifying Tier waiver authorities as approved by the Inspector General
Advisory Board and IAW AFI 33-360. Chapter 3.6 re-emphasizes AAR reporting. Chapter 8
has been significantly amended to emphasize AFLLP orientation versus training. Additionally,
clarification has been made to Chapter 9 for the role of Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and
Reconnaissance Agency’s (AF ISR Agency) system management of the Joint Worldwide
Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) Joint Lessons Learned Information System
(JLLIS).

                                            Chapter 1

                                   PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Overview. This publication establishes guidance and procedures for the AFLLP Air Force-
wide. The AFLLP exists to enhance readiness and improve combat capability by capitalizing on
the experiences of Airmen.
1.2. Purpose. An LL is an Observation that, when validated and resolved, becomes an
evaluated insight resulting in an improvement in military operations or activities at the strategic,
operational, or tactical level. It results in long-term, internalized change to an individual or an
organization. Coupling LL with past experiences should also assist senior leaders in
programming, budgeting, and allocating resources as well as making changes to doctrine,
organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy
(DOTMLPF-P).
   1.2.1. An LL observation is not a compliance “report card” nor is it automatically accepted
   and implemented without the scrutiny of functional experts. An LL is also not “owned” by
   any one organization. Rather, the mandate for all organizations participating in the AFLLP is
   to coordinate activities and collaboratively exchange Observations and Lessons Identified for
   the benefit of the total Air Force mission.
   1.2.2. Air Force Lessons Process (AFLP). The role of the AFLP is to facilitate the
   learning of Lessons identified across the Air Force. The AFLP has four fundamental
   components: Collection, Validation, Dissemination, and Resolution. Figure 1.1 depicts the
   AFLP.

Figure 1.1. Air Force Lessons Process (AFLP).
6                                                           AFI90-1601 18 DECEMBER 2013


    1.2.3. Collection. Collection is the method by which Observations initially enter the AFLP.
    Observations can be “pulled” into the process through formal collection efforts or “pushed”
    into the process by organizations, units, and individuals. When a lesson is not learned it is
    collected on again. In an AF learning culture, every Airman, AF civilian, and AF contractor
    can contribute to the AFLP.
    1.2.4. Validation. Validation consists of review by a staff functional and/or operational
    expert to confirm an Observation has identifiable lessons to be processed through the AFLP.
    Once validated, an Observation becomes a Lesson Identified and represents a matter (e.g.,
    capability, concept, process, or procedure) to be sustained, improved, or developed; or a
    capability shortfall requiring corrective action. A Lesson Identified contains a better way to
    accomplish a mission or task for learning by a broader community.
    1.2.5. Dissemination. Dissemination is the distribution of Lessons Identified to
    organizations for action or information, along with making lessons available for wider use.
    The aim of dissemination is to get lessons to decision makers and Airmen in time for them to
    make more informed decisions. Means of dissemination include, but are not limited to the
    use of JLLIS database (https://www.jllis.mil or http://www.jllis.smil.mil), transfer of JLLIS
    entries to lower or higher echelon LL offices, LL reports, and LL bulletins.
    1.2.6. Resolution. In Resolution, Lessons Identified are addressed to ensure they become
    Lessons Learned and are not forgotten or ignored. Resolution ensures they are staffed for
    action (i.e., DOTMLPF-P changed), captured in JLLIS (or appropriate documents), and
    tracked to closure. Tracking Lessons Identified is a process that occurs throughout the life
    cycle of a validated Observation.
    1.2.7. Identified LL offices will establish procedures to resolve Lessons Identified and
    accomplish issue resolution actions taken by OPRs. LL offices will ensure periodic updates
    are annotated in JLLIS. Until DOTMLPF-P changes from a Lesson Identified are
    implemented and become a Lesson Learned, OPRs and LL offices will observe corrective
    actions and be vigilant for similar repeat Observations.
    1.2.8. The LL process is not intended to bypass the chain of command. A structured process
    is in place to review Observations by appropriate JLLIS Tier-1 Administrators, Tier-2
    Command Lesson Managers (CLMs), and functional subject matter experts (SMEs).
    1.2.9. Due to their different mission and responsibilities, LL functions will not be combined
    in the same office with Historians and/or Inspector General (IG) and/or standardization and
    evaluation (stan/eval) functions. Whereas the IG and stan/eval functions are tasked to
    provide an objective “report card” on organizational compliance, LL functions are
    collaborative partnerships to capture and share lessons. For similar reasons, the LL program
    will not be combined with the Safety function at any echelon. However, Lessons Identified
    in both IG, Safety, and History functions should, when possible, be sent to the AF LL
    Community.
    1.2.10. In accordance with CJCSI 3150.25, Joint Lessons Learned Program (JLLP), JLLIS
    is the system of record for the Department of Defense and the JLLP. As such, AARs, LL
    collection reports, Observations, Lessons Identified, and LLs will ultimately reside in the
    JLLIS database to the maximum extent feasible. To ensure the sharing of reports and LLs,
    JLLIS must be the primary vehicle used to implement the AFLP.

1.3. Waivers. When complying with official policy, guidance, and/or procedures, the unit may
request a waiver.
   1.3.1. Waiver requests will be IAW AFI 33-360. All waiver authorities for each unit (wing
   or equivalent, and below, Field Operating Agency (FOA), or Direct Reporting Unit (DRU))
   are established according to tiers IAW AFI 33-360.

AFI90-1601 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                 9


     2.1.6.10. Integrates LL with the Joint Staff, other Service, and non-Department of
     Defense (DOD) government agencies. Integrates LL activities and processes across the
     total force to synchronize collections and disseminate information quickly.
     2.1.6.11. Analyzes LL content produced by other members of the LL community, other
     government organizations, and research agencies to extract lessons applicable to AF
     operations not previously reported and/or acted upon. Disseminates this analysis to
     targeted AF organizations and through posting in JLLIS.
     2.1.6.12. Reviews AARs and any collection reports to extract and act upon any Lessons
     Identified not previously reported and or acted upon. Disseminates this analysis to
     targeted AF organizations and through posting in JLLIS.
     2.1.6.13. Coordinates LL studies that have operational and doctrine implications with the
     LeMay Center.
2.2. MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs.
  2.2.1. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs will designate an organization as lead for LL activities,
  normally designated as A9L. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs may designate that a
  subordinate Numbered Air Force (NAF) or Center perform all or part of MAJCOM, FOA, or
  DRU-level LL functions in accordance with their respective supplement to this AFI. All
  waiver authorities are established according to tiers IAW AFI 33-360.
  2.2.2. The MAJCOM/FOA/DRU LL organization will:
     2.2.2.1. Serve as OPR for the LL program.
     2.2.2.2. Ensure LL collection processes are established and implemented. Ensure
     organizations add a JLLIS review for any applicable LL to unit coordination and
     approval processes. Ensure LL collection reports and AARs are posted in JLLIS and
     Lessons Identified are addressed for major operations, contingencies, key exercises,
     experiments, and other significant events and topics identified by leadership.
     2.2.2.3. Ensure Observations and AARs are entered into JLLIS no later than (NLT) 30
     days after the event.
     2.2.2.4. Establish a process to validate Observations and share Lessons Identified.
     2.2.2.5. Share LL products’ Lessons Identified with other MAJCOMs, NAFs, and lower
     echelons through the AFLLP.
     2.2.2.6. Elevate to AF/A9L any Lessons Identified with implications across the AF or
     that are beyond the scope of the organization’s authority to address.
     2.2.2.7. When designated as the Air Force Component to a Unified Combatant
     Command (UCC), participate in both the AFLP and in the UCC’s LL process (as the air
     component). These roles overlap as AF organizations may have an interest in operational
     lessons originating in other areas of responsibility (AORs) and the UCC may have an
     interest in AF initiatives that can improve operations in that theater.
     2.2.2.8. Facilitate the expedient up-channeling of AARs and Lessons Identified through
     the AFLP and the UCC LL process as appropriate.
 10                                                        AFI90-1601 18 DECEMBER 2013


      2.2.2.9. Represent their organization’s participation in or provide input to AF/A9L for
      LL activities.
      2.2.2.10. Participate with HQ USAF, MAJCOM, Joint, and Interagency LL activities.
      2.2.2.11. Work with MAJCOM/FOA/DRU A-Staff and special staff planning teams to
      incorporate applicable lessons to support the full spectrum of military operations.
      2.2.2.12. Work with MAJCOM/FOA/DRU teams across all functional areas to
      coordinate policy, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and operational strategy,
      and with the LeMay Center for Doctrine Development and Education to coordinate
      doctrine development.
      2.2.2.13. On a bi-monthly basis, share Fiscal Year plans, schedules, and activities via the
      USAF LL Community Calendar on the JLLIS SharePoint website
      (https://portal.jllis.mil/USAF) and provide updates as they are available.
2.3. All Airmen.
   2.3.1. All Airmen are encouraged to register in JLLIS and enter Observations that contain
   potential lessons into JLLIS for coordination through the AFLP and/or inform the local chain
   of command as appropriate.
   2.3.2. Individuals or organizations lacking access to the JLLIS website may use AF Forms
   4329, AF Observation, Issue, or Lessons Learned, and 4330, After Action Summary Report,
   to record their Observations and e-mail them directly to the appropriate NAF, MAJCOM, or
   HQ USAF-level LL office.          Both forms are available online at         http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil.
AFI90-1601 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                      11


                                            Chapter 3

                                        COLLECTION

3.1. Purpose. Collection is the method by which Observations initially enter the AFLP.
Observations can be “pulled” into the process through formal LL collection efforts or they can be
“pushed” into the process by organizations, units, or individuals. In a learning culture, every AF
unit’s Airmen, civilians, and contractors (including those serving with another Service) can
contribute to the AFLLP by collecting observations and submitting them into the AFLP.
3.2. Types of Collections. LL Collections are normally accomplished at the request of
leadership or nominated by the LL staff. LL staff notionally leads the directed collection effort
with inputs from SMEs, but they can serve as mentors for another organization’s collection
effort. LL Collections capture the facts and participant Observations regarding a combat or non-
combat event. The collection can occur at the strategic, operational, and/or tactical level. There
are three types of LL Collections:
   3.2.1. Event collection. Captures the facts and participant Observations regarding a combat
   or non-combat event as it occurs. The collection can occur at the strategic, operational,
   and/or tactical level. Examples include exercises, such as RED FLAG, or contingencies,
   such as Superstorm Sandy or Operation ODYSSEY DAWN. Event collections may be
   accomplished two ways:
       3.2.1.1. Participative collection. The LL staff performs two roles during the event.
       First, they participate in the unit’s operational battle rhythm, attend staff meetings, man
       the Crisis Action Team, and/or provide real-time inputs to the commander’s planning and
       decision process. Second, the staff forms teams to collect data at the tactical, operational,
       and/or strategic levels. Large-scale operations, such as disaster relief operations, might
       involve teams from HQ USAF, MAJCOMs, NAFs, other Services, and UCCs collecting
       data either independently or in concert based on goals. However, LL organizations
       involved should coordinate efforts to the maximum extent possible in order to minimize
       demands on unit’s during ongoing operations.
       3.2.1.2. Observational collection. An LL team records the organizational structures,
       processes, and resources used to accomplish an infrequent, noncombat event so that tacit
       knowledge gained during the event can be explicitly documented, stored, and retrieved
       for later use during similar events (e.g., Quadrennial Defense Review Process).
   3.2.2. After event collection to capture important best practices or issues. Reconstructs
   specific events or combat operations after the fact to gain a better understanding of the
   event’s successes and challenges. AFLP allows an organization to capture historical events
   and share lessons gained from participants’ knowledge and experience, even though the
   Lessons Identified may already be resolved and no further actions are required. This can be
   done in coordination with historians, but is not intended to duplicate their work.
   3.2.3. Topical collection. This collection focuses on a specific subject or cyclic processes
   (e.g., surveys, focus areas, etc.) based on an LL organization’s desire to further examine or
   collect information about a specific topic.
 12                                                         AFI90-1601 18 DECEMBER 2013


   3.2.4. Observations and Lessons Identified through event collections and topical collections
   will be entered into JLLIS for validation, dissemination, and resolution.
3.3. Techniques and Tools. LL collections can employ the full range of techniques and tools,
tailoring them to the specific situation. Techniques and tools include direct observation, in-
person interviews, commanders’ exit interviews, surveys, database submissions by participants,
AARs, data and database mining, and document capturing. Sharing of data between LL
professionals, historians, and other learning organizations is highly encouraged to coordinate on
collection dissemination, especially via the JLLIS online database.
3.4. General LL Collection Approach.
   3.4.1. When possible, collections should be coordinated in advance with involvement of LL
   staff SMEs. Collections on many important events (e.g., warfare, contingencies, etc.) are
   often conducted with little or no notice. Individuals must consult with LL staff on collection
   techniques and be prepared to apply them during the collection.
   3.4.2. Where possible, an LL collection within an organization’s AOR should be augmented
   as required by other LL offices and SMEs. For most collections, SMEs and functional area
   experts are better suited to observe and document employment of their respective processes.
   3.4.3. The LL office (at any level) will normally lead collection efforts. AF/A9L
   participation with other LL organizations in CSAF-directed/multi-service/joint collections
   permits better access to senior leadership and documents broader perspectives.
3.5. Observation Submission Procedures.
   3.5.1. AFLP procedures standardize Observation submission and management at all AF
   echelons. Observation submission procedures consist of collecting Observations of events
   and operations, reviewing, and entering them in JLLIS. Lower echelons will address
   Observations at their level and forward those beyond their scope to the appropriate level.
   3.5.2. Observation submission procedures apply to all units either conducting their routine
   missions or participating in contingencies and/or exercises (e.g., combat operations,
   humanitarian operations, base closures, peacekeeping operations, noncombatant evacuations,
   exercises, etc.).
   3.5.3. Observations should flow from the reporting individual and agency to the reviewing
   office or functional expert and, if required, to the next higher level LL office.
3.6. AAR Reporting. All waiver authorities for each unit (wing or equivalent, and below) are
established according to tiers IAW AFI 33-360.
   3.6.1. AARs are intended to help Airmen fight a smarter, more capable fight. The next
   Airmen to deploy, to participate in that exercise, to train for that type contingency, etc.,
   should benefit from reports submitted by those who have gone before. Timely submission of
   AARs (and the individual Observations which comprise them) are a command responsibility.
   Air Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) commanders, commanders of subordinate AETF
   units, exercise/experiment directors, and other like commanders/directors are expected to
   submit a unit-level AAR for the event (e.g., deployment, contingency, exercise, etc.) for
   which they are responsible. AARs are posted in JLLIS and accessible to all registered users.
   (T-2)
AFI90-1601 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   13


  3.6.2. Observations to be documented are those which have or can result in improvements in
  military operations at the strategic, operational, or tactical level. AAR Observations should
  describe how the mission could be/was improved, potential risks to mission degradation and
  how to mitigate those risks. AARs are intended to be more than a summary or rollup of
  unit/tactical actions. Commanders/directors are not required to hold Observations until the
  end of an operation, exercise, or Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) cycle for which the AAR
  will be produced. Whenever possible, AARs should be submitted as soon as practical to
  permit timely action. (T-2)
  3.6.3. Units participating in operations as part of a continuous AEF cycle will submit AARs
  to their respective Higher Headquarters (HHQ) NLT than 45 days (for ARC units 90 days)
  following the end of their deployment. Air Force Forces staff and AOC staff will also submit
  periodic AARs for continuous AEF operations (e.g., Operation ENDURING FREEDOM).
  Individual Observations deserving urgent attention should not be delayed for inclusion in the
  next AAR, but should be forwarded up the chain of command as soon as sufficient
  information is gathered. The goal is to get the information to the next set of deployers and/or
  HHQ staff decision makers quickly for action/resolution. (T-2)
  3.6.4. AARs for operations not supported by a continuing AEF cycle (i.e., contingencies and
  exercises) will be submitted to HHQ NLT 30 days (for ARC units 60 days) after the end of
  the event unless otherwise directed. (T-2)
  3.6.5. Owning organizations will review AARs to pull Observations for processing through
  the AFLP and post AARs to JLLIS. Lessons Identified during this review will be entered in
  JLLIS and disseminated to the appropriate OPR for information and resolution. (T-1)

                                           Chapter 4

                                        VALIDATION

4.1. Purpose. Validation consists of review by staff functionals and/or operational experts to
confirm an Observation contains an identifiable lesson to be processed through the AFLP.
Validation gets to DOTMLPF-P root causes of the Observation. It ensures accuracy,
applicability, and completeness, and activates the Observation in JLLIS. Once validated, an
Observation becomes a Lesson Identified and represents a matter (e.g., capability, concept,
process, procedure) to be sustained, improved, or developed; or a capability shortfall requiring
corrective action. A Lesson Identified contains a better way to accomplish a mission or task for
learning by a broader community.
4.2. Validation Authority (Staff Functional and/or Operational SME).
   4.2.1. The validation authority has a key role in the AFLP. Validation authorities will:
       4.2.1.1. Review Observations for accuracy, applicability and completeness.               If
       Observations do not meet these criteria, validation authorities will contact the originator
       for further clarification.
       4.2.1.2. Determine if an Observation had previously been addressed. If the Observation
       duplicates previous Observations, it will be manually linked in JLLIS with the previous
       Observations.
       4.2.1.3. Determine the applicable guiding documents (e.g., statute, DOD, or AF
       instruction).
       4.2.1.4. Analyze Observations for root causes to determine DOTMLPF-P actionable
       areas.
       4.2.1.5. Submit Observations to the appropriate SME for evaluation. Once the SME
       confirms the Observation’s validity, it is processed as a Lesson Identified. IG, stan/eval,
       or Quality Assurance offices will not be appointed as the evaluation agency.
       4.2.1.6. Ensure Lessons Identified are returned to the originating JLLIS Tier-1
       Administrator and/or Tier-2 CLM for dissemination to issue resolution OPRs.
       4.2.1.7. Forward Lessons Identified intended for the HQ USAF staff through JLLIS to
       AF/A9L.
       4.2.1.8. Inform the chain of command as to status of Observations submitted to higher
       level LL offices.
   4.2.2. Validation SMEs may be instructors, staff functionals, career field functional
   managers, commanders, senior AF leaders, or LL offices.
   4.2.3. Lessons Identified deemed as time-critical and/or mission-critical will be concurrently
   disseminated to other potentially interested organizations and individuals where mission
   impact may occur.
AFI90-1601 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                      15


                                            Chapter 5

                                       DISSEMINATION

5.1. Purpose. Dissemination is the distribution of Informational Lessons and Lessons Identified
to organizations for action, along with making lessons available for wider use. The goal of
dissemination is to get lessons to decision makers when needed to make more informed
decisions.
   5.1.1. Lessons may be disseminated through tasks, briefings, bulletins, reports, or database
   entries.
   5.1.2. An OPR will be tasked to either resolve to closure Lessons Identified requiring
   DOTMLPF-P action/changes or ensure Lessons Identified requiring wider dissemination are
   appropriately promulgated.
   5.1.3. An OCR will be assigned as required by the originator of the Lesson Identified or as
   required by the OPR.
5.2. Dissemination Techniques.
   5.2.1. The guiding principle in executing a dissemination strategy is to get the right
   information to the right person at the right time. Dissemination of Lessons Identified to
   individuals or organizations may be solicited or unsolicited. Techniques for either type of
   dissemination encompass both “push” and “pull” methodologies.
       5.2.1.1. “Push” methodologies transmit lessons proactively to identified recipients. In
       this case, LL specialists identify target audiences for dissemination. Examples of when
       to “push” Lessons Identified are when assisting planning staffs during emerging
       situations (e.g., contingencies, relief operations, etc.), assisting headquarters staffs with
       Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution decisions, and when sending
       completed LL documents such as AARs to identified audiences via a subscription
       service. Push solicited information when responding to a Request for Information. In
       this case, LL specialists may push relevant lessons on the particular event or topic to the
       requesting party.
       5.2.1.2. “Pull” methodologies allow individuals to retrieve lessons by conducting JLLIS
       queries or by researching and retrieving published LL reports and bulletins.
   5.2.2. Other dissemination processes may already exist within lower echelons or functional
   communities. Examples include the Tactics Review Board process and the Maintenance
   Quality Assurance flash process. Integration of Lessons Identified provides a mechanism to
   integrate the AFLP with lower echelon processes.
   5.2.3. Although dissemination activities may be conducted using different approaches, the
   basic process step of identifying action items must take place for each Lesson Identified
   before submittal to the resolution processes or inclusion in publications, reports, summaries,
   briefings, and analyses.
 16                                                        AFI90-1601 18 DECEMBER 2013


                                          Chapter 6

                                       RESOLUTION

6.1. Purpose. In Resolution, Lessons Identified are tracked to ensure they become a Lessons
Learned and are not forgotten or ignored. Resolution ensures they are staffed for action
(DOTMLPF-P changed), captured in JLLIS (or appropriate documents), and tracked to closure.
Tracking Lessons Identified is a process that occurs throughout the life cycle of a validated
Observation.
   6.1.1. Resolution has three main objectives:
       6.1.1.1. Enhance the AF’s and the joint community’s ability to learn from the conduct of
       operations across the levels of warfare, training activities, exercise events, and other
       activities.
       6.1.1.2. Enhance warfighting capabilities by documenting potential solutions across
       DOTMLPF-P approaches and implementation decisions.
       6.1.1.3. Support Air Force senior leaders’ decision making.
6.2. Tracking Issue Resolution (TIR). TIR ensures Lessons Identified are worked to closure.
TIR documentation establishes accountability for resolution, monitors resolution actions to
closure, and provides a means of disseminating Lessons Identified.
   6.2.1. AF/A9L will:
       6.2.1.1. Maintain a crossflow of Lessons Identified between the HQ USAF, Services,
       Joint Staff, UCCs, and other government organizations.
       6.2.1.2. In conjunction with SMEs and subordinate LL offices, track the status of AF
       Lessons Identified to the JLLP. Tracking and coordination are essential for lessons with
       programmatic implications.
       6.2.1.3. Provide orientation on TIR including the use of JLLIS for all HQ USAF
       organizations.     The orientation includes techniques on integrating lessons into
       staff/organization plans and operations as well as coordination of lessons between JLLIS
       MAJCOM Tier-1 Sites.
   6.2.2. MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs will (All waiver authorities for each unit (wing or equivalent,
   and below, FOA, and DRU) are established according to tiers IAW AFI 33-360):
       6.2.2.1. With the support of their respective MAJCOM/FOA/DRU LL organization,
       convene a recurring review board to track the status of lesson actions deemed critical to
       the organization. These items may include, but are not limited to, items identified to the
       JLLP. Active management of action items is essential for lessons with operational and
       programmatic implications. (T-1)
       6.2.2.2. In conjunction with SMEs and subordinate LL offices, track the status of
       Lessons Identified to the JLLP and the organization’s critical lesson action items
       identified to the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU. Tracking and coordination are essential for
       lessons with programmatic and operational implications. (T-1)
AFI90-1601 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   17


       6.2.2.3. Provide guidance/orientation on organizationally developed TIR processes
       including the use of JLLIS for their respective organizations. Guidance/orientation
       includes techniques on integrating lessons into staff/organization plans and operations as
       well as coordination of lessons between JLLIS NAF/Wing/Center/FOA/DRU Tier-2
       CLMs. (T-1)
   6.2.3. NAF/Center/Unit LL Organizations will:
       6.2.3.1. Maintain a cross-flow of Lessons Identified within their command/ functional
       community. (T-2)
       6.2.3.2. In conjunction with SMEs, track the status of NAF/Center/Unit Lessons
       Identified to the JLLP. Tracking and coordination are essential for lessons with
       programmatic implications. (T-2)
       6.2.3.3. Provide guidance/orientation on organizationally developed TIR processes
       including the use of JLLIS for their respective organizations. Guidance/orientation
       includes techniques on integrating lessons into staff/organization plans and operations as
       well as coordination of lessons between JLLIS Tier-2 CLMs. (T-2)
6.3. Closure of Lesson Actions. Lessons Identified that are entered into an organization’s
resolution process should be resolved at the lowest level. Actions for Lessons Identified may be
closed when a solution has been implemented (i.e., DOTMLPF-P change) or a decision made to
accept the risk of not implementing a solution. Closed Lessons Identified will be archived in
JLLIS for future reference and their final action/determination will be disseminated and
periodically reviewed.

                                          Chapter 7

                    JOINT LESSONS LEARNED PROGRAM (JLLP)

7.1. Purpose. The JLLP is governed by CJCSI 3150.25, Joint Lessons Learned Program. In
support of the JLLP, the Air Force Lessons Learned Program will:
   7.1.1. Provide and maintain JLLP support for Air Force-specific, tactical, operational, and
   strategic level lessons.
   7.1.2. Interact with other stakeholders within the JLLP community on LL matters.
   7.1.3. Submit Lessons Identified that affect the joint community or requiring joint resolution
   to the Joint Staff.
7.2. Concept. AF/A9L will:
   7.2.1. Represent the Air Force to the Joint Staff and the JLLP community on JLLP matters
   except when the JLLP matter only applies to a specific UCC. Air Force matters only
   applying to a specific UCC will be represented by the AF component to that UCC.
   7.2.2. Provide personnel and technical expertise to document Lessons Identified, analyze
   causation and impact, train collection team SMEs as able, and coordinate Air Force SME
   participation in JLLP activities.
   7.2.3. Track and coordinate joint Lessons Identified within the AFLLP.
7.3. Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Integration. LL
involvement and participation in the JLLP will include:
   7.3.1. Monitoring joint LL products to include the JCIDS and Joint Staff Action Processing
   systems.
   7.3.2. Assisting HQ USAF and MAJCOM offices with Joint LL submissions and
   DOTMLPF-P Change Request development, as required.

                                 AFLLP ORIENTATION

8.1. Purpose. The purpose of the AFLLP orientation is to ensure individuals assigned to LL
offices or as collection team augmentees/SMEs receive appropriate LL training to understand
their role in the AFLP.
8.2. AF Lessons Learned Orientation (All waiver authorities for each unit (wing or

            JOINT LESSONS LEARNED INFORMATION SYSTEM (JLLIS)

9.1. DOD system of record for JLLP. JLLIS is a web-based system that implements the
requirements for the JLLP. JLLP provides transfer of knowledge within the DOD through the
rapid distribution of Observations and recommendations, AARs, TTPs, topic papers, briefings,
and interviews.
9.2. JLLIS. JLLIS allows Air Force personnel to search, submit, and manage all Air Force
Observations, Lessons Identified, AARs, LL, and other information up to TOP
SECRET/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI). JLLIS is used to track and
disseminate Lessons Identified throughout the Air Force, DOD, and Intelligence Community.
JLLIS provides LL office management, data collection, data management, and LL information
distribution.
9.3. System Administration.
   9.3.1. AF/A9L is responsible for system administration of the Unclassified Non-Secure
   Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) and SECRET Internet Protocol Router Network
   (SIPRNet) AF JLLIS master sites through coordination with Joint Staff/J7 and JLLIS
   programmers. The AF ISR Agency, on behalf of the AF LL community, is responsible for
   system administration of the TS/SCI AF JLLIS master site on the JWICS through 30 Aug
   2014. Afterward, the AF ISR Agency will, on behalf of the AF LL community, facilitate
   submission and resolution of LL concerns on JWICS in coordination with AF/A9L and Joint
   Staff/J7. AF/A9L will provide administrative support and Joint Staff/J7 (to include Joint
   Staff/J7 JLLIS programmers) will provide administrative and system support to AF ISR
   Agency to the furthest extent possible, dependent on security clearances and available
   resources.
   9.3.2. The AF/A9 JLLIS Program Manager will update the JLLIS User Guide and checklists,
   maintain a standard orientation package on the JLLIS home page, and update this instruction
   annually or when changes to the system and/or process occur.
9.4. JLLIS Business Rules.
   9.4.1. The JLLIS community will abide by the CJCSI 3150.25, JLLIS Business Rules, and
   the following guidelines in managing their JLLIS operations (All waiver authorities for each
   unit (wing or equivalent, and below), FOA, and DRU are established according to tiers IAW
   AFI 33-360):
       9.4.1.1. A Tier-1 Administrator is a Lesson Manager at the HQ USAF and MAJCOM
       level. A Tier-2 CLM/Administrator is a Lesson Manager at the NAF, Wing, or Center
       level. All other sub-organizations will be assigned as a Tier-3 Organization Lesson
       Manager (OLM). A Lesson Manager is the manager of Observations and Lessons
       Identified at the Tier-1, Tier-2, or Tier-3 level. A SME is a person within a Directorate,
       Command, or unit possessing expertise on an Observation, issue, or Lesson Identified.
       (T-1)
       9.4.1.2. Validation Process. Tier-1, Tier-2, and Tier-3 Lesson Managers and SMEs will
       review all “Pending” lessons within their Tier. Once an Observation is deemed valid, the
AFI90-1601 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  21


      Tier-1, Tier-2, or Tier-3 Lesson Manager will activate the Observation as a Lesson
      Identified and transfer it to the appropriate OPR/OCR for review. Observations that
      require work within the Tier will be coordinated through the Tier-1/Tier-2/Tier-3 Lesson
      Manager or the appropriate OPR/OCR. Additionally, Tier-1 and Tier-2 Lesson Managers
      will also review “Pending” reports posted in the JLLIS Document/File Library and
      determine whether to “Activate or Close” so all reports will be visible to JLLIS users.
      (T-1)
      9.4.1.3. Coordinating Observations Outside a Tier-1 organization. Tier-1 Lesson
      Managers will work together toward resolving an Observation’s ownership. If the
      OPR/OCR for an Observation belongs to another Tier-1 organization, the owning Tier-1
      Administrator will contact the appropriate Tier-1 Administrator for coordination before
      transferring. Once transferred, the accepting Tier-1 organization assumes responsibility
      for the Observation. If it is found that the OPR/OCR is incorrect, the process will begin
      again. If ownership cannot be resolved at the Tier-1 level, AF/A9L will resolve
      ownership. All Lessons Identified will be worked through to resolution. (T-1)
9.5. Disputes between Tiers (All waiver authorities for each unit (wing or equivalent, and
below), FOA, and DRU are established according to tiers IAW AFI 33-360).
   9.5.1. As Lesson Managers receive Observations submitted by JLLIS users, there may be
   occasions where a Tier-2 is not appropriate to validate that Observation. In these cases, the
   Tier-2 Lesson Manager will transfer the Observation to their Tier-1 for reassignment. When
   doing this, include results of any coordination in the “comment” section of the Observation
   in JLLIS. (T-2)
   9.5.2. When Observation reassignments between Tier-2 CLMs are disputed, the issue should
   be brought to the attention of the MAJCOM LL Director to render a recommended
   assignment. If the dispute continues, the MAJCOM LL Director will present it to AF/A9L
   for LL GOSG review and coordination. The LL GOSG is chaired by the AF/CV. The
   AF/CV will serve as final arbiter of disputed Observations’ assignments if necessary. (T-2)
9.6. JLLIS Maintenance (All waiver authorities for each unit (wing or equivalent, and
below), FOA, and DRU are established according to tiers IAW AFI 33-360).
   9.6.1. Tier Maintenance. All Tier-1 Administrators should perform periodic Tier
   maintenance. Maintenance includes reviewing the status of “Active” Observations. Any
   Observations that have not been worked in more than 30 days should be reviewed and
   readdressed by the Tier-1, Tier-2, or Tier-3 Lesson Manager through the OPR/OCR for
   resolution, closure, or removal from the database. (T-2)
      9.6.1.1. Observations that should be removed include the following:             “Test
      Observations,” Observations that are incomplete or unfocused, complaints, or personal
      attacks.
      9.6.1.2. Test Binders and AARs should also be removed periodically to keep the Tier
      free of unnecessary information.
   9.6.2. MAJCOMs or NAFs that are an air component to a UCC may be asked by the UCC to
   participate in the UCC LL program. Component MAJCOMs and NAFs will participate in
   their UCC’s LL program as directed by UCC policy and are authorized to coordinate
 22                                                         AFI90-1601 18 DECEMBER 2013


   Observations directly with their responsible UCC. Coordination may be conducted by
   emailing the Observation to the UCC JLLIS Administrator or by entering the Observation on
   the UCC JLLIS site.
   9.6.3. MAJCOMs not a component of a UCC will forward Observations requiring Joint,
   DOD Agency or UCC coordination to the HQ USAF Tier-1 or the appropriate MAJCOM/C-
   NAF. The HQ USAF Tier-1 Administrator will notify the responsible action officer/SME
   who will review and validate the Observation with their Joint, Agency, or UCC point of
   contact and assume responsibility for tracking the Observation through to resolution.
   9.6.4. JLLIS website status updates are the responsibility of the AF/A9L action officer.
   Updates are available upon request through the responsible AF/A9L action officer.
9.7. JLLIS Configuration Review Board (CRB).
   9.7.1. The AF JLLIS CRB will be scheduled to allow sufficient time to address AF
   requirements prior to the Joint CRB.
   9.7.2. The Board will review action items from the previous Board, configuration issues,
   modifications, and business rules. Each Tier-1 Administrator will have an opportunity to
   provide input during the Air Force JLLIS CRB.
   9.7.3. The Air Force JLLIS CRB is chaired by the Air Force JLLIS Program Manager. Tier-
   1 Administrators and the Recorder are voting members of the CRB. Members of the Joint
   Staff/J7 have a standing invitation to attend. This courtesy is also extended to the other
   members of the Air Force JLLIS and LL community.
   9.7.4. Each Tier-1 Administrator is responsible to collect input(s) from their respective Tier-
   2s for the Air Force CRB prior to the conference. The purpose is to provide an opportunity
   for Administrators to speak/vote for the actions that affect their Tier. The Tier-2 CLMs are
   not voting members of the Air Force CRB. In the event of a tie during the voting process,
   the Air Force JLLIS Program Manager will cast the deciding vote.
   9.7.5. All Air Force CRB items that impact the other JLLIS master sites must go before the
   Joint Staff/J7 and the Joint Lessons Learned Conference CRB for review and approval. The
   AF JLLIS Program Manager will represent the Air Force during the Joint Lessons Learned
   Conference on all Air Force JLLIS related issues. Results from the Joint Lessons Learned
   Conference will be shared and reviewed by the JLLIS LL community.
9.8. Network Security.
   9.8.1. Joint Staff/J7 policy and guidance for NIPRNet JLLIS only allows access to Australia,
   Canada, Great Britain, and United States (ACGU) personnel and Foreign Exchange
   Officers/Liaison Officers sponsored and/or assigned to DOD organizations. United States
   Government has a National Disclosure Policy for SIPRNet. The following information is in
   accordance with Joint Staff/J7 guidance pending release of formal DOD guidance for JLLIS:
      9.8.1.1. JLLIS information is considered For Official Use Only (FOUO). If there is a
      requirement to convert/migrate FOUO data to a DOD-wide system of Controlled
      Unclassified Information (CUI), the FOUO marking of JLLIS products will help prevent
      commercial access, but allow access to those with valid requirements and registration.
AFI90-1601 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                    23


      9.8.1.2. DOD Instruction 8110.1, Multinational Information Sharing Networks
      Implementation, implements policy and designates the MNIS Combined Enterprise
      Regional Information Exchange System (i.e., MNIS CENTRIXS) as the DOD standard
      for multinational information sharing networks using the Global Information Grid.
   9.8.2. ACGU personnel assigned to or sponsored by a DOD organization and issued a
   Common Access Card permitting access to the DOD computer network/system are
   authorized access to JLLIS. These members are authorized to register in JLLIS as members
   of their assigned and sponsoring DOD organization.
      9.8.2.1. Registration is validated and controlled through the organizations’ security
      office and approved by the Air Force JLLIS Program Manager.
      9.8.2.2. ACGU personnel who are validated and authorized access to the US DOD

Terms
Active—A status of a Lesson Identified indicating that the lesson is currently being worked to
resolution by a DOTMLPF-P OPR.
After Action Report (AAR)—The AAR is a consolidated report that includes an executive
summary covering the event information (e.g., dates, locations, and participants) and
Observations. Observations to be documented are those which result in improvements in
military operations. AAR Observations should describe how the mission could be/was
improved, potential risks to mission degradation and how to mitigate those risks.
Collection—Collection is a method by which Observations enter the AFLP and involves formal
and informal methods. Observations can be “pulled” into the process through formal collection
efforts or they can be “pushed” into the process by organizations, units and individual Airmen. In
a learning culture, every Airman, civilian and contractor contribute to the AFLP.
Dissemination—Dissemination is the distribution of Informational Lessons and Lessons
Identified to organizations for action, along with making lessons available for wider use. The
goal of dissemination is to get lessons to decision makers when needed to make more informed
decisions.
DOTMLPF-P—Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership & Education, Personnel,
Facilities, and Policy are factors that implement senior leader guidance and lead to the
development and employment of joint force capabilities.
JLLIS—JLLIS is the system of record for the AF LL process and may be used by any Airman.
JLLIS is the central repository for Observations, Lessons Identified, AARs, and other LL reports.
Lesson Identified—A validated Observation that represents a matter (e.g., capability, concept,
process, procedure) to be sustained, improved or developed. A Lesson Identified contains a
better way to accomplish a mission or task for learning by a broader organization.
Lesson Learned—An insight gained that improves military operations or activities at the
strategic, operational, or tactical level and results in long-term, internalized change to an
individual or an organization.
Observation—An input from any source into the AFLP. Observations contain information
regarding specific events, activities, circumstances or outcomes and should include sufficient
factual and contextual information to support their validation.
Resolution—Process to ensure Lessons Identified are staffed for action. Resolution actions
should be captured in JLLIS or appropriate documents and tracked to closure.
AFI90-1601 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                         29


System of Record (SoR)—An information storage system (commonly implemented on a
computer system), which is the authoritative data source for a given data element or piece of
information. The need to identify systems of record can become acute in organizations where
management information systems have been built by taking output data from multiple source
systems, re-processing this data, and then re-presenting the result for a new business use. Where
the integrity of the data is vital, a data element must either be linked to, or extracted directly from
its system of record. The integrity and validity of any data set is open to question when there is
