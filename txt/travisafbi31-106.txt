    2.2. For the purpose of this instruction, minors, juveniles and children are synonymous and are
    defined as unmarried military affiliated family members, visitors or guests under 18 years old. In no
    instance will a juvenile family member be considered a valid sponsor for a visitor.
TRAVISAFBI31-106 21 APRIL 2008                                                                           3


   2.3. The following curfew hours are established for children on Travis AFB:
       2.3.1. Sunday through Thursday nights, between 2200 and 0600.
       2.3.2. Friday and Saturday nights and evenings preceding an official school holiday, between
       2300 and 0600, except as noted in paragraph 2.4. below.
   2.4. Exceptions to the above policy are:
       2.4.1. When a minor is accompanied by his or her parent, guardian, or other adult person having
       the care and custody of the minor, or when such minor is on an emergency errand directed by his
       or her parent, guardian, or other adult person having the care and custody of such minor.
       2.4.2. When a minor is attending an approved function (i.e., function officially recognized by the
       installation commander or school officials) under adult supervision. The curfew will not be
       enforced until the event concludes.
       2.4.3. Minors with jobs that extend past curfew hours will proceed by the most direct route
       between their place of employment and their sponsor's residence after they leave to or from work.
       2.4.4. Minors who reside on Travis AFB and who enter the base after curfew hours will be
       allowed to proceed directly to their sponsor's residence.

3. Child Supervision. The minimum age for a child to be left alone is 10, provided child has appropriate
level of self-care skills and maturity. Refer to Attachment 2 for more guidance.
   3.1. Lack of supervision is a form of child neglect. Lack of supervision means there is a risk of injury
   or harm to the child because the parent(s) or caregiver are intentionally absent, are not paying close
   enough attention, or fail to arrange for sufficient supervision. Violation of these guidelines may con-
   stitute child neglect. Allegations of child neglect may be reported and result in Child Protective Ser-
   vices and Family Advocacy intervention.
   3.2. Parents are ultimately responsible for the care and safety of their children. Since each child has
   different emotional, behavioral, mental and physical capabilities, every parent must exercise responsi-
   ble judgment in supervising their children. Given these factors, a child should not be left without
   appropriate supervision, regardless of age, if the child is unable to demonstrate the maturity and
   self-management skills necessary to be unsupervised.
   3.3. When considering whether to leave children at home alone, it should be considered how well the
   child:
       3.3.1. Completes tasks.
       3.3.2. Follows instructions.
       3.3.3. Communicates problems to parents.
       3.3.4. Uses good judgment.
       3.3.5. Is not fearful of being home alone.
       3.3.6. Knows how to report and respond to specific emergency situations, to include but not lim-
       ited to: fire, poison, and injuries.
       3.3.7. Understands personal safety including how to react to strangers.
4                                                                 TRAVISAFBI31-106 21 APRIL 2008


    3.4. Parents who feel their children are not ready to be left unsupervised must ensure they are left
    under the supervision of another responsible person and must fully examine the availability of appro-
    priate adult help in the event of an emergency. Appropriate adult help is defined as an individual at
    least 18 years of age or a mature adolescent who has passed the required Red Cross babysitting train-
    ing and who is capable of self care and the care and supervision of children. A caregiver must be iden-
    tified as the individual responsible for the child’s well-being, guidance, and supervision during the
    period the child is in the persons care.
       3.4.1. In all cases, children must have emergency telephone numbers to locate a parent or desig-
       nated caregiver, and also fully understand how to use emergency numbers such as 911. If leaving
       a child alone with an appropriate caregiver overnight, parents should provide a medical power of
       attorney to the caregiver to ensure that their child will have access to medical care if necessary.

4. Off-limit areas. The following areas are off-limits to juveniles:
    4.1. “The Pit” (located in the dormitory area) unless accompanied by their sponsor or an adult.
    4.2. Dormitory areas unless accompanied by the juvenile’s parent or legal guardian. The dormitory
    area is defined as any immediate areas or structure where unmarried male or female personnel reside.
    4.3. The base gym, if under age 14, unless accompanied by juvenile’s sponsor or responsible adult.

5. Other prohibitions:
    5.1. No person will carry or discharge firearms of any kind; explode any combustible device; use a
    slingshot, air gun, paint gun, or bow and arrow, except in places and at times authorized by the instal-
    lation commander or the California Penal Code.

6. Travis Disciplinary Action Program. The TDAP is the direct responsibility of the 60th Mission Sup-
port Group Commander (60 MSG/CC).
    6.1. The TDAP objectives are to:
       6.1.1. Maintain good order and discipline on Travis AFB.

                     TRAVIS DISCIPLINARY ACTION PROGRAM (TDAP)

A3.1. What is the PURPOSE of TDAP?
   A3.1.1. TDAP is a program designed to reduce and deter future dependant, civilian, contractor and
   juvenile misconduct by administering constructive corrective action in order to provide safe and secu-
   rity living conditions for our military members and their families. When offenses occur, action is
   swift. Offenses can include: curfew violations, shoplifting, assault, mutual affray, illegal use/posses-
   sion of BB guns, vandalism, property damage, substance abuse, underage drinking, drunk driving,
   reckless driving, domestic abuse, communicating a threat, and failure to control pets. The process
   generally involves the entire family and community.

A3.2. What is the TDAP PROCESS?
   A3.2.1. Misconduct can result in an administrative hearing. This hearing is a formal military appoint-
   ment held in the 60th Mission Support Group Conference Room. The military sponsor reports in full
   service dress uniform to the TDAP hearing officer. The Unit Commander or First Sergeant is also
   present. After the hearing is completed, the hearing officer determines the appropriate corrective
   action for the offender. The action is formally documented and kept as a permanent record while liv-
   ing or working on Travis AFB. Actions can include: letter of warning, verbal counseling, community
   service, essay, restricted curfew, suspension of AAFES privileges, suspension of driving privileges,
   financial restitution, letter of apology, 24-hour parental eyes-on supervision, suspension of club privi-
   leges, substance abuse evaluation/education, suspended barment or barment from Travis AFB.

A3.3. SUPERVISON is still essential.
   A3.3.1. TDAP is no substitute for senior leadership, parental supervision, and community involve-
   ment. Prevent hardships for your airman, employees, coworkers, and dependents by educating them
   on base policy, state, and federal laws.

SUBJECT: Notification of Travis Disciplinary Action Program Hearing – Dependant


1. Security Forces records indicate that your family member, John Doe, has committed a curfew violation
and is suspected of using illegal narcotics. Misconduct of this nature is prejudicial to good order and dis-
cipline on Travis Air Force Base. As a sponsor, you are responsible for the actions of your dependents.


2. Under Travis Air Force Base Instruction 31-106, Travis Disciplinary Action Program, and as a result of
your family member’s actions, you are directed to appear at a Travis Disciplinary Action Program
(TDAP) hearing. John Doe will accompany you. The presiding authority hears all cases referred to him in
which a military dependant is alleged to have engaged in misconduct on Travis AFB. The presiding
authority, after hearing all the evidence, will take appropriate command action. The hearing will provide
you and your family member the opportunity to explain why base privileges should not be limited and/or
revoked and why disciplinary action, to include barment, should not be taken. The presiding authority
may also recommend other action, to include community service, restitution, referrals to base agencies, or
referral to local authorities.


3. You have been scheduled to appear before the TDAP committee with your family member, John Doe,
on 1 July 2007, at 1400 hours in the 60 MSG Conference Room, Building 51. Spouses of juveniles are

strongly encouraged to attend. You and/or your family member may make an oral statement to the TDAP
committee. You and/or your family member may provide any other information you wish considered, in
written form only. This is a closed hearing not open to the public. Per Travis Air Force Base Instruction
31-106, this is not intended to be an adversarial proceeding. There is no right to be represented by legal
counsel at the hearing nor is there any right to call or cross examine witnesses. If you and your family
member are unable to attend because of scheduling conflicts or other unavoidable commitments, you may
request a delay by contacting the 60th Security Forces Squadron Reports and Analysis Section at (707)
424-1133. If access to the installation is required, you may request access by contacting Security Forces
Plans and Programs at (707) 424-3537.


4. Failure to appear before a TDAP hearing or comply with the decision of the presiding authority may
also result in your family member’s case being forwarded to the local authorities for disposition. Failure
to appear before the TDAP committee may result in the recommendation to 60 AMW/CC that your family
member be barred from base for his/her misconduct.


5. A copy of Travis Air Force Base Instruction 31-106, which explains the TDAP, is provided as an
attachment for you.

SUBJECT: Notification of Travis Disciplinary Action Program Hearing Result – Dependant


1. You and your child attended a Travis Disciplinary Action Program (TDAP) hearing on 1 July 07. After
careful evaluation of the evidence, I find your dependant, John Doe, was involved in an assault with a
paint gun and a curfew violation. This conduct will not be tolerated. As a result, I authorize your son to
take the following actions in lieu of curtailment of his base access or privileges.


John Doe will be prohibited from driving a motor vehicle on Travis Air Force Base until 1 January
2008. Any further misconduct will result in further restrictions and could result in barment from
the installation for up to 3 years.


2. If you disagree with my finding, you may appeal it in writing to the 60 MSG/CC, through the Reports
and Analysis Office, within seven days of receipt of this letter. The 60 MSG/CC will provide a written
decision to you. The address is 60 MSG/CC, Attn: Travis Disciplinary Action Program, 540 Airlift Drive,
Bldg 381, Rm C101, Travis AFB CA 94535.

effect on your dependant. If you have any questions, please contact the 60th Security Forces Reports and
Analysis Office at (707) 424-1132.
