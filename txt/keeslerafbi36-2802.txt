6. AWARD PRESENTATIONS. All nominees should be present at the Quarterly/Annual
Awards Luncheon/Banquet.
     6.1. Civilian winners are eligible for Time-Off Awards (TOAs) based on the
     HIGHEST/LAST level at which they won a quarterly/annual award.
        6.1.1. Quarterly Awards: Squadron Level (4 hrs); Group Level (9 hrs); Wing Level (12
        hrs).
        6.1.2. Annual Awards: Squadron Level (9 hrs); Group Level (12 hrs); Wing Level (18
        hrs).
        6.1.3. TOAs are awarded based on the HIGHEST/LAST level at which a person was
        declared the winner. For example, Squadron-level quarterly winners who do not win at
        the next level receive a single TOA for 4 hours; Group-level quarterly winners who do
        not win at the next level receive a single TOA for 9 hours; Wing-level quarterly winners
        receive a single TOA for 12 hours. Therefore, the civilian quarterly award winner should
        receive no more than 12 cumulative hours including all lesser unit awards, and the annual
        award winner should receive no more than 18 cumulative hours including all lesser unit
        awards. Units are responsible for initiating and processing all TOAs for their personnel
        using the electronic Standard Form 52 (SF 52), Request for Personnel Action.
     6.2. Due to other types of award recognition given, and to comply with directives precluding
     dual recognition for the same act or period of service, Civilians are not authorized to receive
     Notable Achievement Awards (NAAs) under this program. NAAs continue to be authorized
     when submitted for other periods of achievement or unrelated achievements. Units must be
     careful in their selection of the various forms of recognition accorded to their appropriated
     fund winners. Subordinate level awards must be less in value than the awards presented by
     the next higher level, including the Wing, for the same period and accomplishment. In
KEESLERAFBI36-2802 22 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                         9


   making this determination, consider that at Wing level the winners also receive trophies and
   other compensation that is not given at subordinate levels.
7. QUARTERLY AWARDS LUNCHEON & ANNUAL AWARDS BANQUET
COMMITTEE. The Quarterly Awards Luncheon & Annual Awards Banquet Committee is
chaired by the Wing Quarterly/Annual Awards Chairman, and will consist of members
representing the units listed in paragraph 5.1.1. and will be guided by the 81 TRW/CCC or
designated representative. This committee is responsible for hosting the Quarterly Awards
Luncheons and the Annual Awards Banquet.
8. FUNCTIONAL AWARD COORDINATION. All functional awards, special awards and
trophies, etc., covered by AFI 36-2805, Special Trophies and Awards; AETCI 36-2801, AETC
Recognition Program; or other DoD instructions must be released by 81 TRW/CC prior to final
submission.
9. AWARD CERTIFICATE. KAFB Form 14, 81st Training Wing Certificate, can be
presented to each individual in lieu of plaques/awards. No copy is required to be kept for
records.
