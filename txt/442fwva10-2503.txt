            Additional Comments:
     In addition to this visual aid; reference facility layout drawings highlighting SIP locations, evacuation routes and assembly
     point locations. Request an Active Shooter Loose On Base (ASLOB) checklist from your Unit EM Representative or Facility
     Manager to keep readily available in your work center. If instructed to shelter-in-place due to an IED/UXO within proximity
     of your facility and no time to evacuate; youâ€™ll be instructed where to take cover by base authorities and Facility Manager.
