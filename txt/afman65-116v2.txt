                                          PART 1

                 GENERAL INFORMATION AND RESPONSIBILITIES

                                         Chapter 1

                               GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This chapter contains general information about DJMS that applies to all input
sources outside the financial service office (FSO).
1.2. Supporting Documents. Actions affecting a member's master military pay account
(MMPA) must be supported by human-readable documentation. This consists of signed and
certified documents completely explaining each transaction. Source documentation also includes
transactions that do not affect pay and allowances but are required in DJMS to maintain a
member's pay account.
   1.2.1. Types. DJMS requires source documents for all transactions to support changes to the
   MMPA and to clear rejected and suspended items listed on the daily register of transactions
   (DROT) for control purposes. The four types of source documents are:
       1.2.1.1. Regular Source Documents. Authorize and support changes in entitlements and
       deductions on MMPA.
       1.2.1.2. Miscellaneous Source Documents. Authorize changes to MMPA which do not
       involve entitlements and deductions. Examples are changes to payment option and taxing
       authority (city, state).
       1.2.1.3. Military Leave Documents. See Chapter 7 and AFMAN 65-116V1.
       1.2.1.4. Administrative Source Documents. Use to change member's address,
       international balance of payments (IBP) code, and organization code in the central-site
       JBIT file.
   1.2.2. Disposition. Send original and one copy of supporting documents to FSO. See
   Chapter 7 and AFMAN 65-116V1 for leave transactions.
1.3. Input Source Code. FSO assigns a two-position alphanumeric input source code to each
activity authorized to prepare and submit DJMS documentation. Use this code on AF Form 1373,
MPO Document Control Log - Transmittal, as well as on each DJMS supporting document,
when submitting source documents to the FSO. Put the source code in the upper right hand
corner of the documents (Figure 1.1).
1.4. Input Formats. Formats are designed for minimum input at base-level with maximum use
of central computer programs to determine and calculate effects on a member's pay account. For
example: Defense Finance & Accounting Service - Denver Center (DFAS-DE) computer
programs update all items in member's account affected by promotion input, entitlements,
deductions, and other miscellaneous data.
1.5. Transmission of Documents to FSO. Each input source transmits original and one copy
of source documents to the FSO daily. Use AF Form 1373 (Figure 1.1) prepared in duplicate for
transmittal of all documents except leave, and send original AF Form 1373 with source
 8                                                         AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


documents to the FSO; keep a copy in suspense awaiting acknowledgment of receipt by FSO
through an entry on the DROT (paragraph 1.9). AF Forms 1373 are sequentially numbered by
the input source. FSOs may, if they wish, require the input source to renumber AF Forms 1373
at the beginning of each fiscal year. When transmitting multiple MPOs or blanket orders to the
FSO, the AF 1373 can be annotated "See Attached."
1.6. Filing of Source Documents. Keep a suspense copy of every source document. Attach this
copy to the DROT (paragraph 1.9) and keep for reference and audit. Each input source makes
sure there is a properly certified document in suspense for each transaction appearing on the
DROT. Notify the FSO of any transaction appearing on the DROT for which you do not have
proper documentation. Follow-up to determine processing status of any source documents in
suspense which have not been acknowledged within five workdays by an entry on the DROT.
Retain as specified in Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (see paragraph 6.10.2.2) for
exception.)
1.7. Inquiries. Direct members to customer service counter of servicing FSO. Where distance
is too great, advise member to use telephone or letter to communicate with the Customer Service
section of the FSO. Individual members at geographically separated units (GSUs) may call
DFAS-DE in an emergency when access to, or through, an FSO is unavailable. DFAS-DE
monitors and controls all telephone calls to ensure against abuse of this form of communication.
Replies to telephone inquiries are made by telephone or email.
1.8. Rejects. Data entering DJMS are subjected to base-level and DFAS-DE edits to make sure
only acceptable and valid data are used to update MMPA. Incorrect or invalid data are not
accepted and are rejected from the system. Base personnel research all errors, determine action
required, and when applicable, correct and resubmit transaction per applicable chapters of this
volume. Any document rejected to an input source that is resubmitted must be included on a new
AF Form 1373.
1.9. Input List. The terms "DROT" and "JUMPS Transaction Register (JTR)" are used to
describe the input list produced by DJMS-AC.
     1.9.1. Content. Input list is produced for each input source and shows:
        1.9.1.1. Base-level processed transactions.
        1.9.1.2. DFAS-DE rejected transactions.
     1.9.2. Sequence. Input list is in input source, transaction number, FORMAT-ID, action
     indicator, and SSN.
     1.9.3. Sample. See Figure 1.2
1.10. Messages/FAX/Telephone/Email. When servicing FSO is at a different location from a
unit, DJMS data may be transmitted by base communications. Message should cite name and
SSN of member, description of change with effective date, and any other data necessary to
support a change in a member's pay account. Submit a confirming certified source document
immediately. The source document should contain the same data as reported in the message.
     1.10.1. FAX: Faxing of documents for processing into DJMS is permissible. Units should
     contact their FSO for the FAX telephone number. AF 1373 should be used as the transmittal
     document. Follow-up with original documents is not required unless requested by servicing
     FSO under special circumstances.
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                     9


   1.10.2. Telephone: Refer to paragraph 2.3 when it becomes necessary to request DJMS
   changes by telephone.
   1.10.3. MyPay: Members may submit various changes to DJMS via myPay, to include tax
   withholding changes, address changes, and dependent support allotment starts, stops, or
   changes.
1.11. Claims. When a member believes additional pay or allowances are due, the member:
   1.11.1. Prepares a claim letter which includes:
       1.11.1.1. Date prepared.
       1.11.1.2. Identification of items claimed, period involved, and amounts, if available.
       1.11.1.3. Claimant's signature and SSN.
   1.11.2. Attaches any documents that support the claim.
   1.11.3. Submits the claim to the FSO for action outlined in AFMAN 65-116V1, chapter 74.
   1.11.4. For claims involving BAS, see paragraph 6.9.2.

                                           Chapter 2

                                     RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Purpose. This chapter defines responsibilities of organizations and individuals outside the
FSO who are involved in DJMS input.
2.2. Certifying Officers. Certifying officers provide certified substantiating documents, having
no impact on permanent duty station (PDS), to the servicing FSOs. Examples of these documents
are assignment of government quarters and debt notices. Certification establishes that the facts
stated in supporting documents are correct. Certifying officers base the certification on personal
knowledge of facts acquired during performance of duty. Each input source must have at least
one person who is a certifying officer (paragraph 2.9).
2.3. Geographically Separated Units (GSU). GSU submits substantiating documents daily to
servicing FSO when such documents affect pay and allowances, leave, and other data in MMPA.
When distance to the servicing FSO requires allotment service by the GSU, prepare allotment
documents and submit them to the servicing FSO; otherwise, members receive complete
allotment service from the servicing FSO. The GSU commander appoints certifying officers
(paragraph 2.9) per DoDFMR, Vol 5. Certifying officers at remote GSUs may request a
decrease or stop pay in a member's pay account by telephone call to the servicing FSO; they
immediately send confirmation hardcopy documents supporting telephone request to servicing
FSO. (Restrict use of telephone change requests to emergency situations.)
2.4. Member. The member assists in updating the MMPA by providing the responsible office
with all information and documents relating to mailing address for the member and dependents.
The member also provides information and documents on status of dependents and any other pay
determining or pay-distribution facts. (Allotments are considered a distribution of pay.)
2.5. Allotter. Allotter is a member with an allotment who is responsible for advising the FSO of
changes in address and other circumstances affecting allotments. Included are changes of address
for dependents, changes in bank, etc.
2.6. Commander:
   2.6.1. Unit Commander or Other Individual on G-Series Orders with Command
   Responsibility for the Member. In addition to their command responsibilities, unit
   commanders or other individual on G-Series orders with command responsibility for the
   member are responsible for authorizing certain financial entitlements for the members under
   their command. Those responsibilities include, but are not limited to:
       2.6.1.1. Authorizing the appropriate rate of BAS to be started or certifying the number of
       meals missed.
       2.6.1.2. Annually verifying the BAS entitlements of enlisted members who are not under
       blanket authority or are below pay grade E-5;
       2.6.1.3. Approving requests for advance of pay and allowances;
       2.6.1.4. Verifying members’ continued entitlement to special duty pays and incentive
       pays;
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                   11


       2.6.1.5. Verifying that members were subject to hostile fire or were present in an area
       designated as a tax exclusion area; or
       2.6.1.6. Preparing reinstatement letters for members whose with dependent rate BAH
       entitlement has been stopped because the recertification statements were returned to the
       FSO late. The commander must certify, when appropriate, that failure to recertify timely
       was for reasons beyond the member’s control (see JFTR, Vol I, chapter 10). In these
       cases, the member’s higher rate of BAH will be restarted, effective the day after the stop
       date.
       2.6.1.7. Verifying that member was unable to meet jump requirements over a 3-month
       period because of military operations of particular command, or absence of jump
       equipment or aircraft (see Chapter 3, Table 3.3, note, item 4, this manual).
   2.6.2. GSU Commander. Ensures documents are accurate and submitted on time.
   2.6.3. Installation/Wing Commander. Fully supports this system. This includes, but is not
   limited to, briefing all personnel on DJMS, ensuring coordination between staff agencies for
   accurate and timely flow of documents and machine products, and appointing certifying
   officers.
   2.6.4. Intermediate Command Commander. Monitors base-level procedures to make sure all
   agencies are following procedures in this manual.
   2.6.5. Major Command Commander. Implements instructions in this directive and is
   responsible for input from FSOs and MPFs under MAJCOM jurisdiction. Data from DFAS-
   DE to the field becomes MAJCOM responsibility when released from DFAS-DE. Accuracy
   and timeliness of input are measured in DFAS-DE's Centralized Examination Findings
   (CEF).
   2.6.6. DELETED.
2.7. Other Government Agencies. Advise DFAS-DE of debts due the United States by an Air
Force member (for example, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax levy). DFAS-DE updates the
MMPAs.
2.8. Other Military Services. Other services send DFAS-DE copies of vouchers and money
list on which they paid Air Force members. DFAS-DE updates the MMPAs.
2.9. Signature Cards. A DD Form 577, Signature Card, or appointment letter is required to be
maintained at each input source for each certifying officer appointed under DoDFMR, Vol 5.
Signature cards or appointment letters are not required for commanders to certify DJMS
supporting documents particular to personnel under their control. Commanders can appoint
individuals under their command as certifying officers by appointment letter or signature card.
Do not appoint document control clerks, leave monitors as certifying officers.

                                               PART 2

                                        PROCEDURES

                                           Chapter 3

      HOST AVIATION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT OFFICE PROCEDURES

3.1. Purpose. This chapter prescribes procedures to be used by the Host Aviation Resource
Management (HARM) office and MPS in support of DJMS.
3.2. Aviation Duty.
   3.2.1. Conditions of Entitlement. See DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 7,
   Part A (DoDFMR), chapter 22, for entitlement to aviation career incentive pay (ACIP) and
   hazardous duty incentive pay (HDIP). As used in this chapter, ACIP refers to flying duty for
   rated officers, HDIP refers to flying duty for non-rated officers and enlisted members.
   Entitlement to career enlisted flyer inventive pay (CEFIP) for enlisted members is addressed
   in AFMAN 65-116, V1, chapter 22. On a quarterly basis, the FSO provides a listing of
   members receiving ACIP, HDIP, CEFIP or Parachute Pay to the HARM for
   verification/reconciliation. For additional information, see AFMAN 65-116, V1, chapter 22
   or, for Reserve and Guard members paid in DJMS-RC, see AFMAN 65-116, V3, chapter 20.
   3.2.2. Substantiating Documents. Table 3.1 indicates HARM responsibility for supporting
   documents and data required to start, stop, and report entitlement. Aeronautical order (AO)
   or military pay order (MPO) supporting certifying officer's own entitlement to ACIP or HDIP
   is also signed by commander or another designated person who has knowledge of the facts.
   All AOs and MPOs must contain a termination date for all non-crew members. The AO
   must also contain aviation service date (ASD), officer service date (OSD), if a rated officer is
   entering flight status for the first time. The AO must contain an airborne warning and control
   system (AWACS) date if a member is entering for duty as an air weapons controller crew
   member. Adequate administrative records must be maintained at base level to support
   authorized payment. These records must be available for review by the General Accounting
   Office when warranted.
   3.2.3. Preparation of DD Form 114, Military Pay Order (MPO). When using the DD Form
   114 or the MPO section of AF Form 1887, Request and Authorization for Aeronautical
   Orders, the start date in the MPO is the first day of entitlement to ACIP or HDIP. When a
   member is removed or suspended from ACIP, HDIP, or CEFIP, the stop date is the last day
   of entitlement. For example:
      3.2.3.1. Officer is entitled to ACIP effective 1 Jan 2008. The start date in the MPO
      should read 080101.
      3.2.3.2. Officer is suspended from flying status effective 1 Jan 2008. The stop date in
      the MPO should read 071231 (one day before the effective date of suspension).
   3.2.4. System Provisions:
      3.2.4.1. Effect of input transactions:
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                13


          3.2.4.1.1. Input transactions report start, stop, report, change, correct, or cancel
          entitlements and update member's MMPA for pay computation.
          3.2.4.1.2. FSO forwards a copy of the daily register of transactions (DROT) to
          HARM for verification of processing.
      3.2.4.2. Programmed Stops. HDIP is automatically stopped for non-crew members:
          3.2.4.2.1. On separation.
          3.2.4.2.2. Upon permanent change of station (PCS).
      3.2.4.3. Continuance:
          3.2.4.3.1. Crew Members. HDIP continues on separation with immediate
          reenlistment.
          3.2.4.3.2. Others. Once an entitlement to ACIP or HDIP is entered on member's
          MMPA, entitlement continues until HARM provides documentation changing the
          member’s status, or events in 3.2.4.2 above occur.
      3.2.4.4. Entitlement to ACIP or HDIP and Other Hazardous Duty Pay. Restrictions are:
          3.2.4.4.1. Members who qualify may receive ACIP and two other hazardous duty
          pays.
          3.2.4.4.2. Members who qualify may receive HDIP and one other hazardous duty pay
          or diving duty pay.
          3.2.4.4.3. Members in continuous or conditional entitlement to ACIP are not entitled
          to HDIP.
          3.2.4.4.4. Members entitled to HDIP for AWACS duty are not entitled to HDIP for
          flying.
3.3. Parachute Jumping Duty.
   3.3.1. Conditions of Entitlement. See DoDFMR, chapter 24 for entitlement to incentive pay
   for the two types of parachute jumping duty. Type one is parachute jumping from an aircraft
   in aerial flight and type two is parachute jumping at a high altitude with a low opening
   (HALO). On a quarterly basis, the FSO provides a listing, of members receiving Parachute
   Pay, to the HARM for verification/ reconciliation. For further information, see AFMAN 65-
   116, Vol I, chapter 23 or, for Reserve and Guard members paid in DJMS-RC, see AFMAN
   65-116, Vol 3, chapter 17.
   3.3.2. Substantiating Documents. Use aeronautical orders to start or stop entitlement and
   change entitlement from regular parachute duty to HALO duty. All AOs must contain the
   type of parachute duty and a termination date for officer non-crew and all enlisted members
   (AFI 35-13). Use DD Form 114 for other actions.
   3.3.3. Procedures. Submit assignment AO to FSO after member completes initial
   requirements. A DD Form 114 (Figure 3.1) supporting certifying officer's own entitlement to
   parachute jumping duty pay must be signed by commander or another designated person who
   has knowledge of the facts. Table 3.2 and Table 3.3 show what documents to use and the
   data required by FSO to start, stop, report, correct, or cancel parachute jumping duty.

   station after member departs on permanent change of station (PCS).
4.5. Members in Need of Transportation.
   4.5.1. Documents Furnished by Transportation Office. A member, traveling on leave or
   delay en route and is without funds for transportation to duty station, contacts the local
   transportation officer, who furnishes member with a document showing cost of ticket.
   Transportation officer may contact FSO to verify pay status prior to preparing the required
   documents. The documents can be faxed between offices. Document, prepared as below, are
   signed by the transportation officer or designee. Member presents this document to FSO:
   "This is to certify that (name, grade, and SSN) has presented (himself, herself) to this office
   and states that (he or she) does not have funds for providing transportation to (his or her)
   duty station. Cost of meals and ticket is $__________________ " (Signature)
                             Name, title, and date.
   4.5.2. Insufficient Accrued Pay. If enough pay has not accrued to cover cost of
   transportation and meals as shown on document furnished by transportation officer (4.5.1
   above), FSO enters a notation to this effect on the document and returns it to the member.
   Local transportation officer issues a transportation request and meal ticket to member. The
   payment to the commercial carrier is made by the DFAS-IN and is forwarded to DFAS-
   DE/JAA for posting of a casual payment to the member's MMPA. If the transportation office
   pays the carrier direct, the host FSO inputs the casual payment data to DFAS-DE. No DD
   Form 139 is required for excess cost charges for leave.
4.6. Processing DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization, from JPPSO. JPPSO-
SAT/ECAF forwards all DD Forms 139 for excess cost of personal property shipment and house
trailer moves for Air Force members to the member's servicing FSO and establishes a
miscellaneous debt on the MMPA. FSO advises member of debt. The TMO counsels member
regarding rebuttal procedures. If member wishes to rebut indebtedness:
   4.6.1. Member takes action through local TMO.
   4.6.2. The local TMO reviews the member's request and, if legitimate, notifies the FSO. All
   rebuttal paperwork is then forwarded from the local TMO to ECAF with copy of the
   transmittal letter sent to the FSO. If local TMO doesn't uphold rebuttal, member should see
   the local FSO to discuss remission or other indebtedness rights as outlined in AFMAN 65-
   166V1, chapter 69.
4.7. Waiver Consideration. Public Law 99-224 amended 10 U.S.C. 2774 and 32 U.S.C. 716 to
include waiver of travel, transportation, and relocation expenses and allowances. However, this
expanded authority applies only to overpayments made on or after 28 Dec 1985. Members
should be referred to the local FSO for counseling on waiver of indebtedness.

                         BASE HOUSING OFFICE PROCEDURES

Section 5A—Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) Guidelines for Housing Management
Office and Unit Commander.

5.1. General. This section contains procedures and instructions for starting, stopping, adjusting,
and verifying BAH entitlement. Installation commanders and Housing Management Offices have
authority to establish BAH entitlements for different classes of members.
5.2. Permanent Party Housing Allowances. When members who are permanently assigned at
a duty station terminate or occupy quarters, the Housing Management Office is responsible for
preparing AF Form 594, Application and Authorization to Start, Stop, or Change Basic
Allowance for Quarters (BAQ) or Dependency Re-determination, (Table 5.1) and sending the
document to the servicing FSO for input into DJMS. The organization initiating the AF Form
594 can use Table 5.1 and Table 5.2 for some of the common occurrences of BAH starts, stops
or changes. However, for situations that go beyond these examples, entitlement guidance is
available in the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR), chapter 10. The authorizing organization
also participates in the entitlement and quarters verification processes.
   5.2.1. The Housing Management Office authorizes partial rate BAH by completing AF Form
   594 when members are assigned to unaccompanied personnel housing. The Housing
   Management Office is responsible for starting unaccompanied members' without-dependent
   rate BAH for grades E-4 and below (Table 5.1) or stopping any unaccompanied member's
   without-dependent rate BAH. The Housing Management Office provides the FSO with
   written notification when a member (E-4 or below), who is drawing BAH at the "with
   dependent" rate solely because of paying child support, is assigned to or terminates,
   unaccompanied personnel housing. The FSO uses the notification to support the start or stop
   of the member's entitlement to BAH-DIFF.
   5.2.2. The Housing Management Office is the responsible organization for starting or
   stopping accompanied members' BAH when a military family moves into or out of family
   housing. This includes the member who receives BAH own right in a member-to-member
   marriage.
   5.2.3. Unit commanders or other individual on G-Series orders with command responsibility
   for the member are responsible for starting, stopping, or changing with or without-dependent
   rate BAH for members assigned to housing that is provided by activities other than Air Force
   organizations or where the assignment to or termination of unaccompanied housing is
   controlled by unit commanders.
   5.2.4. The FSO starts, stops, or changes a member's BAH entitlement in certain
   circumstances. In those instances, the FSO forwards a copy of the AF Form 594 to the
   appropriate organization.
   5.2.5. The Authorizing Officer. The housing management officer or unit official designates
   member's housing status, signs and dates the "Non-availability/Assignment/Termination of
   Quarters" section of the AF Form 594 when members are assigned to or terminate quarters.
   The form is also used when adequate quarters are designated as inadequate or vice versa.
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                   23


   The "EFFECTIVE DATE" is the actual date a member was assigned to housing or the date a
   member terminated housing. The FSO will process transactions that will stop BAH as of
   2400 hours of the day before the assignment date or start BAH on the same date housing was
   terminated or the date that the member departed the station. The form should be delivered to
   the FSO within five workdays (table 5-2).
   5.2.6. The Certifying Officer. The FSO completes the bottom portion of the form and
   determines the effective date based on information provided by the Housing Management
   Office. The entitlement start date is the day quarters are terminated or declared inadequate;
   the entitlement stop date is the day before the quarters are assigned or declared adequate.
5.3. Periodic Entitlement Verification. Certifying Officer and FSO perform periodic reviews
to make sure of continued correctness of entitlement payments. The Housing Management
Office and units are jointly responsible for making sure members residing in their facilities are
not overpaid BAH. The BAH/ACES reconciliation is provided, via Report.Web, to the finance
office. Finance ensures the appropriate reports are provided to the Housing Management Office
for action.
   5.3.1. Verification of Family Quarters Assignments. To prevent erroneous payments of
   BAH, the finance office downloads and provides to the HMO officer lists of members
   identified, via a bump between ACES and DJMS-AC, as residing in government quarters
   receiving BAH. The Housing Office should work to reconcile the lists received and work
   with FSO to correct the records, creating AF Form 594s for those identified as needing
   changes. Upon receipt of notification that the quarterly BAH/ACES bump is available on
   Report.Web, the MAJCOM point of contact distributes the various base-level reports to each
   of its base finance offices. Finance provides a copy of appropriate reports/lists to the local
   housing office for action. Once the reviews are complete, necessary pay adjustments are
   made by finance.
   5.3.2. Verification of Single Quarters Assignments. To prevent erroneous payments of BAH
   to members assigned to single-type government quarters, FSO works with HMO to ensure
   members who are assigned to single-type quarters are receiving partial rate BAH or BAH-
   DIFF if entitlement criteria are met. For those members identified by housing as no longer
   assigned to single-type quarters, the HMO provides an AF Form 594 showing termination
   date. Similarly, for those members HMO identifies as being assigned to single-type quarters,
   HMO provides the FSO with AF Form 594 including assignment date. Within 5 business
   days UH will confirm whether the members on this report are or are not residing in
   Unaccompanied Housing, provide the assignment date/termination date with AF IMT 594. If
   the member no longer resides in UH, then ACES is checked and updated as necessary.
   Finance determines, based on information provided by unaccompanied housing, whether the
   pay record requires adjustment (i.e., start BAH).

Section 5B—Overseas Station Allowances.

5.6. Overseas Housing Allowances (OHA).
   5.6.1. Conditions of Entitlement. See Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), Chapter 10.
   5.6.2. Source Documentation. A DD Form 2367, Individual Overseas Housing Allowance
   (OHA) Report, is required to start a member's OHA entitlement. A DD Form 2367 is
   required on all actions, except PCS, separation, when BAH is being changed, or when
   changes arise from re-certification.
   5.6.3. Source of Input. The member is required to complete DD Form 2367 to start
   entitlement to OHA. The HMO certifies data on DD Form 2367 and forwards form to the
   FSO.
5.7. OHA Re-Certification and Verification Procedures.
   5.7.1. OHA Re-certification:
       5.7.1.1. Frequency. Members receiving OHA must re-certify the status of their
       dependents at PCS arrival, every four years for those who have not completed a PCS in
       that period of time, or within 60 days prior to separation.
       5.7.1.2. Substantiating Document. Members complete AF Form 987, Re-certification
       Statement For Basic Allowance For Quarters (BAQ), Variable Housing Allowance
       (VHA), Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA), Cost Of Living Allowance (COLA), and
       Family Separation Allowance (FSA). The FSO sends the re-certification form to the
       member 60 days prior to member's scheduled re-certification. Member is instructed to
       return the re-certification form to the FSO and include copies of housing documentation
       (rental agreements or leases, etc.) to support any changes in member's rent, sharing status,
       etc. from what was previously reported. When the member submits a lease or mortgage
       document to the FSO, when returning the re-certification form, the FSO forwards housing
       documents and the re-certification form to HMO. The HMO signs the re-certification
       form when there is a change in the member's housing data. The approved re-certification
       form, when received from HMO, is used as a source document in lieu of the DD Form
       2367. The HMO reviews and retains the documentation, authenticates the re-certification
       form, and returns it to the FSO.
   5.7.2. OHA Verification Procedures:
       5.7.2.1. FSOs examine and verify housing expense data contained on the re-certification
       form, for changes such as rental amount or sharing status, to the member's MMPA. If no
       changes have occurred from certification to re-certification, annotate control listing.
       5.7.2.2. Housing must approve the re-certification form whenever it reflects a change in
       the member's housing data.
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                 25


      5.7.2.3. The FSO processes necessary adjustment transactions to correct member's record
      when the approved re-certification form is returned from the HMO. The FSO annotates
      the control listing to indicate member has completed re-certification and any adjustment
      action has been completed.
   5.7.3. Supporting Documents. Housing is required to maintain housing documentation on
   file including lease, rental, and sales agreements for the length of the member's tour.
   5.7.4. Certification. The HMO or appropriate official verifies the housing cost contained in
   the member's lease, rental, or sales agreement, and that the information from it is properly
   reported on DD Form 2367. The HMO also reviews blocks 7 and 8 of this form to make sure
   the utilities provided by the landlord and the sharing status are properly completed. If the
   member checks block 7c and then checks every utility or service except air conditioning,
   make sure member is actually paying for air conditioning. If not, change the form to reflect
   all utilities are provided.
5.8. Control. Maintain a suspense control on every member authorized temporary lodging
allowance (TLA), OHA, and cost-of-living allowance (COLA) for dependents who remain at old
station after member leaves for new permanent station. Furnish data to the gaining FSO to
support the TLA payment voucher. Housing officer furnishes data to the FSO to support TLA
payment voucher.
5.9. Temporary Lodging Allowance. Departure (TLA-Dep):
   5.9.1. TLA is payable before the day of departure. Lodging expenses may be anticipated for
   paying member before departure, provided actual lodging expenses are verified and any
   erroneous payment is collected.
   5.9.2. In unusual circumstances when member cannot be paid before departure, losing
   commander furnishes all information required for preparation of AF Form 1357, Request for
   Temporary Lodging Allowance, (Table 5.4) to gaining commanders to support payment of
   TLA-Dep to be made at new permanent station. Show complete geographical address such as
   city or station, political subdivision, and country (for example, RAF Chicksands,
   Bedfordshire, UK). For a member authorized TLA-Dep for dependent remaining at old
   station after member's departure on PCS, include date last dependent left old permanent
   station. Also, include the reason payment could not be made by losing commander. AF Form
   1357 is normally prepared at gaining base by housing officer or other officer as designated
   by commander.
5.10. Interim Payments. If interim payments are frequently made (every five to ten days)
because of high cost of living, such payments may be certified by commander or designee.
Housing officer is required to furnish actual certification only on final TLA settlements.
5.11. Preparation of AF Form 1357, Request for Temporary Lodging Allowance (Figure 5-
3).
   5.11.1. Prepare an AF Form 1357 to stop TLA credit when a member:
      5.11.1.1. Becomes entitled to interim housing allowance (IHA).
      5.11.1.2. Is furnished government quarters for self, dependents, or both.
      5.11.1.3. Becomes entitled to OHA and COLA.
 26                                                     AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


   5.11.2. In every instance, identify the type of allowance on the AF Form 1357:
      5.11.2.1. I - incoming. (Authorized at beginning of member's assignment at a permanent
      station.)
      5.11.2.2. X - extension of incoming.
      5.11.2.3. K - kitchen renovation. (When residence is under renovation (kitchen) not
      requiring occupants to obtain temporary lodging.)
      5.11.2.4. R - full renovation. (When renovation or special circumstances require
      occupants to occupy temporary lodging.)
      5.11.2.5. D - departure. (Authorized for or within the last ten days before day of
      departure of member or dependents from old permanent station.)
      5.11.2.6. E - extension of departure.
   5.11.3. Complete all entries on AF Form 1357 when applicable.
   5.11.4. Obtain from transportation officer and include on the AF Form 1357 the date when
   household goods (HHG) were available for delivery or shipment and the date they were
   delivered or shipped for TLA-I. Also, for TLA-Dep, obtain date HHG were released for
   shipment.
   5.11.5. When a member with dependents completes AF Form 1357, an election must be
   made to continue or postpone entitlement to TLA for any period of hospitalization or absence
   away from the permanent station while on assigned duty.
5.12. Attachments to AF Form 1357.
   5.12.1. Attach the following to the original AF Form 1357:
      5.12.1.1. Special orders.
      5.12.1.2. Receipts - original or copy for any lodging expense claimed (for example,
      hotel, motel, VOQ, BOQ, guest house, TLQ). If the receipt is lost the member certifies a
      statement of lodging expense containing dates, places, establishment names, and
      amounts.
      5.12.1.3. Itemization of expenses and income. Use the format shown in Joint Federal
      Travel Regulations (JFTR), Chapter 9, or one substantially the same.
   5.12.2. Duplicates for retention are not required.
5.13. Advance Payment of Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA).
   5.13.1. An advance payment of OHA/BAH is payable at the member's request, once
   authorized by the base housing officer and approved by the unit commander or other
   individual on G-Series orders with command responsibility for the member. The member is
   required to complete AF Form 1039, Request to Receive and/or Extend Repayment of an
   Advance Housing Allowance (to Meet Extraordinary Expenses Incident to PCS Move),
   (Table 5.2) when requesting an advance payment for housing and/or extending the
   repayment. To determine the amount of an advance housing allowance that may be
   authorized, see JFTR, Volume 1, Chapter 10. An advance OHA/BAH may be authorized for
   the purchase of personal property needed to occupy economy housing, but is limited to those
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                   27


  items necessary for occupancy and reasonable in nature. The guide to be used to determine
  the amount of advance OHA a member may receive for the purchase of personal property is
  AFI 32-6004 (Attachment 8) plus major appliances. Attachment 8 lists the items that the
  government would furnish if the items were available or if government quarters were
  assigned.     Refer also, to the JFTR, volume 1, Appendix K to page entitled
  "INITIAL/TERMINAL OCCUPANCY EXPENSES" for personal property items that
  generally may or may not be included in determining the amount of advance for OHA/ BAH.
  Normally an advance OHA must not be paid more than three workdays before the member is
  required to make payment under a lease or purchase plan, and except in extraordinary
  circumstances, payment must be made within 30 days after occupancy. This 30-day period
  allows a member sufficient time to move in and determine any extra costs associated with the
  new quarters that were not readily apparent before or immediately upon occupancy. When
  extraordinary circumstances warrant, a waiver of the 30-day period may be approved by the
  unit commander or other individual on G-Series orders with command responsibility for the
  member. The member is required to submit a written request to the base housing officer.
  This request is to briefly state the reason for the delayed advance and show that the funds are
  needed to meet "Advance rent, security deposits or initial expenses". The unit commander or
  other individual on G-Series orders with command responsibility for the member must
  approve or disapprove payment of the advance and is required to verify all claimed expenses.
  Only amounts authorized and verified to supporting documentation should be approved for
  payment.
  5.13.2. The advance may be paid to an eligible member to meet extraordinary expenses in
  obtaining permanent quarters in the vicinity of the member's duty station. Extraordinary
  "moving in" expenses should be reflected in the appropriate blocks 4a, 4b, and 4c of AF
  Form 1039. Block "4d, Other" is not valid and should not be used. Extraordinary expenses
  include such items as:
     5.13.2.1. Security deposits.
     5.13.2.2. Installation fees.
     5.13.2.3. Advance rent or lease.
  5.13.3. As a minimum requirement, a copy of the signed rental or purchase agreement
  should support the member's request for advance. However, at some locations, rental
  agreements are not signed before the time the member is required to make payment. Under
  this circumstance, the advance housing allowance is based on the unsigned rental agreement.
  The approving authority must monitor this to require collection action if a signed agreement
  is not received within three working days by the approving authority. The approving
  authority may require a financial statement or other proof of need when considered
  necessary.
  5.13.4. In service-couple cases or rent-sharing plans, the combined assets, allowances, and
  expenses of the occupants are considered in making determinations.
  5.13.5. The approving authority submits the approved AF Form 1039 to the FSO for
  payment. Supporting documentation for the advance should be filed in the approving office
  and retained for the length of the member's tour. Normally, the advance should not be paid
  more than three working days before the member is required to make payment under a lease
28                                                       AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


  or purchase plan. For personnel at a duty location not having a local payment office, the
  advance may be paid earlier as required by mail or transportation schedules. If the lease or
  purchase plan is not completed, the advance must be repaid in full immediately.
  5.13.6. An OHA advance for a purchase plan may be made only once during a member's
  tour unless the home is damaged or destroyed beyond habitation and the home was not
  covered by compensable insurance. (Request for exceptions to this provision may be
  forwarded with justification and recommendations to the local FSO.)
  5.13.7. Additional advance covering rental plans may be approved at any time for valid
  reasons as determined by the approving authority. Valid reasons include housing removed
  from rental market or member required larger, less expensive, or closer accommodations.
  Outstanding advances remaining upon authorization of an additional advance are added to
  the additional amount and a new repayment schedule established.
  5.13.8. The OHA advance under rental plans is limited per JFTR, volume I, Chapter 9. An
  advance under a purchase plan does not exceed the normal rental deposit required for suitable
  housing for a member of the applicant's grade and dependency status. If the rental deposit
  required for suitable housing is not available, 1/120th of the purchase price (per JFTR,
  appendix K, table 1) may be used as the equivalent of one month's rent. When an advance
  under the purchase plan is given the member, the amount must be based on utility deposits,
  and initial expenses and the advance must not be used in the purchase (closing costs,
  upgrades, etc.). Effective 1 Mar 1984, home buyers are required to itemize their expenses the
  same as required for renters.
  5.13.9. An advance housing allowance is not authorized nor should it be granted to member
  for vacation expenses, furniture, (other than curtains, rugs or major appliances which are
  categorized as PCS related expenses), purchase of second car after PCS, etc. Request for
  advance by members who are required to occupy, or are assigned to government housing
  should be denied.
  5.13.10. Liquidation of the advance payment of housing allowance usually is at a rate of not
  less than equal monthly installments of 1/12 of the amount advanced per month for the next
  12 months. When justified by the member, postponement or extension of the repayment may
  be authorized by the unit commander or other individual on G-Series orders with command
  responsibility for the member. This is accomplished on AF Form 1039. Collection of that
  part of the advance representing a security deposit can be postponed until the member
  vacates the housing. This helps preclude financial hardship that may be caused by the
  member having to liquidate a large advance payment, which is, in all likelihood, refunded
  when the member moves out. The FSO must send a message or other notification to DFAS-
  PMJP/DE to suspend collection of the security deposit portion of the advance.
  5.13.11. Distribution of AF Form 1039 is as follows:
     5.13.11.1. Original - Sent to FSO for attachment to original payment voucher or DTL as
     applicable.
     5.13.11.2. Second copy - Member.
     5.13.11.3. Third copy - Approving official.
     5.13.11.4. Fourth copy - FSO retained copy.

5.14. Move-In Housing Allowance (MIHA). General. MIHA is an allowance designed to
replace the current Initial/Terminal Occupancy Allowance (ITOA) which supplements OHA. For
more detailed information, see JFTR, Vol I, appendix N. MIHA is divided into 3 components:
   5.14.1. MIHA Miscellaneous. This lump sum payment is made to all members overseas who
   became entitled to OHA on or after 1 Sep 90. The housing office will complete DD Form
   2367 to start OHA and generate the MIHA Misc.
   5.14.2. MIHA Rent. The housing officer completes DD Form 2556, Move-In Housing
   Allowance Claim Form for Personnel Occupying Privately Leased/Owned Quarters
   Overseas, and approve or disapprove expenses claimed by the member.
   5.14.3. MIHA Security. The housing officer approves claims on DD Form 2556 IAW JFTR,

provides that the fair-rental value for inadequate quarters does not exceed 75 percent of the member's
BAH at the with-dependent rate. If the member receives BAH at the without dependent rate, the fair-
rental change may be more than the member's BAH entitlement. Fair-rental charges for in-service
spouses are collected equally from each spouse.
6. Whenever fair-rental charges for inadequate quarters change because of a change in the appraised
value or rate of BAQ, it is permissible to use the phrase "Administrative Action" in member's
signature block on the AF Form 594 (or use a DD Form 114).
7. Unit commander or other individual on G-Series orders with command responsibility for the
member must contact billeting.

NOTES:
1. Normally AF Form 594 is prepared by member and certifying officer. If member is not available
because of urgent military reasons (PCS before quarters terminated) or severe illness and is unable to
prepare AF Form 594 to claim BAQ credit for dependents, certifying officer may prepare the form for
member and member's signature is not required. The certifying officer places in member's signature
block, "PCS before quarters terminated," "Severe illness," or other reason why member was unable to
complete form.
2. DoDFMR Volume 7A, chapters 25 through 31, paragraph 260303 (effective 1 Oct 1982), provides
that the fair-rental value for inadequate quarters not exceed 75 percent of the member's BAQ at the
with-dependent rate. When a member is receiving BAQ at the without-dependent rate, the fair-rental
charge may be more than the member's BAQ. Fair-rental charges for in-service spouses are collected
equally from each spouse.
3. Whenever fair-rental charges for inadequate quarters change due to a change in the appraised value
or rate of BAQ, it is permissible to use "Administrative Action: in member's signature block on the AF
Form 594 (or use DD Form 114).
4. Comp Gen B-187229, 1 Aug 1977: "A member of a uniformed service may occupy temporary
lodging facilities in excess of 30 days without loss of BAQ if a substantial "rent" for such quarters is
charged to cover direct operated costs...and if quarters are acquired and operated with non-
appropriated funds."
5. When member and spouse are both military members, prepare an AF Form 594 for each member.
6. Member's assignment to quarters should be terminated at the time PCS travel commences pursuant
to valid orders. The need to keep government quarters utilized to the fullest extend does not override
the requirement of 37 U.S.C. 403 that a member is entitled to BAQ or housing provided by the
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                       35


government. A member cannot be considered to be occupying quarters when member and dependents
have departed the old station under PCS orders. (Comp Gen B-213560, 3 Apr 1984).

NOTES:

1. If quarters are terminated because of a PCS, losing FSO prepares input to DJMS. The AF
Form 594 is prepared by the unit commander or other individual on G-Series orders with
command responsibility for the member or HMO. Member's signature is not required.

2. Input to DJMS must be timely. Documents are sent to the DFRC by bases that have not
cutover to the AFFSC; cutover bases scan documents into the document system used by the
AFFSC and retained there.

3. FSO uses copy #2 as source document and retains with duplicate copy of DTL.

                  OTHER UNIT PROCEDURES (EXCLUDING LEAVE)

Section 6A—Special And Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay.

6.1. General. This chapter contains unit procedures, including Geographically Separated Units
(GSU), and instructions for providing data to support the Defense Joint Military Pay System
(DJMS).
6.2. Direct Deposit. All Air Force members entering active duty on or after 1 July 1989, are
required to participate in Direct Deposit or obtain a waiver from their commander. All members
reenlisting or accepting a regular commission after 1 Sept 1989, are also subject to this policy. In
rare instances waivers to participation in the direct deposit of pay program are approved by a unit
commander or other individual on G-Series orders with command responsibility for the member.
All waivers are approved for period of up to 1 year if it is determined it would be in the best
interests of the DoD and the individual. All paychecks for members with approved waivers will
be issued by DFAS-DE and mailed in sufficient time to reach the individual on payday.
6.3. Hazardous Duty.
   6.3.1. Conditions of Entitlement. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 24, for entitlement to
   hazardous duty incentive pay for duties to include demolition, experimental stress, toxic fuel
   (or propellants), toxic pesticides, dangerous viruses (or bacteria), and chemical munitions.
   6.3.2. Substantiating Documents. Prepare and forward documents listed in Table 6.1 and
   Table 6.2 to support starts, stops, and adjustments to the FSO for processing.
   6.3.3. Reconciliation and Verification is accomplished from a listing provided by the FSO at
   least once a year to assure that a member's duties have not changed. The listing is certified
   by the unit commander or other individual on G-Series orders with command responsibility
   for the member and returned to the FSO.
       6.3.3.1. Verify if member's duty qualifies for the pay member is receiving and annotate
       the list to indicate if member is entitled or not.
       6.3.3.2. .If member is not performing the required duty, annotate this fact on the list and
       submit a DD Form 114 to the FSO to stop the entitlement on the appropriate date unless
       documents were previously submitted. In this case, reference the previously submitted
       document on the listing.
       6.3.3.3. If a member should be receiving an entitlement but is not on the listing, annotate
       the member's name, SSN, and type of entitlement on the listing and prepare appropriate
       document as in Table 6.1
       6.3.3.4. The unit commander or other individual on G-Series orders with command
       responsibility for the member makes sure qualified members meet requirements each
       month.
   6.3.4. Procedures. Member's unit prepares and sends documents in 6.3.2 above to servicing
   FSO for input to update master military pay account (MMPA) maintained at DFAS-DE.
   Specific instructions are in:
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                     41


      6.3.4.1. Demolition Duty. (Table 6.1)
      6.3.4.2. Stress Duty. (Table 6.2)
6.4. Sea Duty.
   6.4.1. Conditions of Entitlement. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 18.
   6.4.2. Substantiating Documents. Use DD Form 114, or special orders assigning member to
   sea duty.
   6.4.3. Certifying Orders. Member's unit commander or other individual on G-Series orders
   with command responsibility for the member must certify special orders to show date
   member reported and, or departed sea duty pay location. Send certified orders to servicing
   FSO for input to update MMPA maintained at DFAS-DE. (Figure 6.1 for sample document.)
6.5. Duty Subject To Hostile Fire Or Imminent Danger.
   6.5.1. Conditions of Entitlement. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 10.
   6.5.2. Substantiating Documents. Use AF Form 1881, Hostile Fire Pay Certification and

   6.5.3. Procedures. Unit commander or other individual on G-Series orders with command
   responsibility for the member determines member's entitlement to hostile fire or imminent
   danger pay and submits certificate to local FSO showing those members who are qualified,
   effective dates, and basis for qualification (DoDFMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 10). Unit
   commander issuing certificates need not be located within combat zone. When members
   perform duty in more than one location of hostile fire area, certificate of commander located
   outside hostile fire area may be used. Certification of eligibility for payment is made at the
   lowest level of command that includes all the vessels, aircraft, or units that are subject to
   hostile fire or imminent danger. When basis for certification is DoDFMR, table 10-1,
   include a brief statement on certificate to provide place, hour, and date of incident.
   Certificates showing classified locations or missions are appropriately classified. In addition,
   sources or methods are marked and controlled per 11 AFI 14-302. Do not under any
   circumstances include or attach classified information, location, mission, intelligence
   information, sources, or methods, in or to MPO.
6.6. Diving Duty Pay.
   6.6.1. Conditions of Entitlement. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 11.

   with command responsibility for the member must certify diving duty MPO. In the case of
   diving duty starts, the commander's certification attests to the following:
      6.6.3.1. The M-Series Order (or memorandum with attached DD Form 114) is current.
      6.6.3.2. The member is required to maintain proficiency as a diver by frequent and
      regular dives.
 42                                                      AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


      6.6.3.3. .The member is actually performing diving duty.
      6.6.3.4. Procedures. Member's unit forwards documents in C6.6.2. above to servicing
      FSO for input to update MMPA maintained at DFAS-DE.

Section 6B—Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS).

6.7. General. For conditions of entitlement, see DoDFMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 25. When one
or more units at an installation perform duty under similar conditions, the installation
commander ensures uniform determinations are made. The types of BAS are:
   6.7.1. Type S: Standard.
   6.7.2. Type O: Officers.
   6.7.3. DELETED.
   6.7.4. DELETED.
6.8. Policy on BAS.
   6.8.1. Effective January 1, 2002, all members entitled to basic pay have a continuous
   entitlement to BAS, with the following exceptions:
      6.8.1.1. Members in Basic Military Training (BMT)
      6.8.1.2. Members in Officer Training School (OTS) who have no prior continuous
      enlisted active duty (active or reserve component)
      6.8.1.3. Members in excess leave status
      6.8.1.4. Members absent without leave (unless absence is excused as unavoidable)
      6.8.1.5. Members on educational leave of absence
      6.8.1.6. Members, with no dependents, who are training for, attending, or participating
      in, Pan American Games, Olympic Games, or other specifically authorized international
      amateur sport competitions, who are subsisted during that period by a sponsoring agency.
      6.8.1.7. Members serving a court martial sentence that includes an approved forfeiture of
      pay and allowances.
   6.8.2. PCS Status. BAS continues through the TDY/PCS period. Meal collections are
   stopped throughout the TDY/PCS period and resume upon completion of the duty or period.
      6.8.2.1. Authorized Leave. BAS continues through the authorized leave period without
      meal charge deductions.
      6.8.2.2. Regular TDY status: BAS continues when a member is on regular TDY status.
      Meal collections are stopped through the TDY period and resume upon completion of the
      TDY.
   6.8.3. Hospitalized in Uniformed Services Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF):
      6.8.3.1. Air Force Medical Treatment Facility. Members hospitalized at a MTF do not
      have meal charges collected. These members are required to pay cash for meals at the
      standard rate.
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                      43


  6.8.4. Field Duty. Meal collections for members on field duty must be initiated when the
  member enters field duty status. Members on field duty will be charged for all meals made
  available, whether eaten or not, subject to approved missed meals.
  6.8.5. Non-Availability of Dining Facility. The installation commander determines if the
  dining facility is in fact not available, and if meal collections for enlisted personnel should be
  stopped, because he or she is in the best position to know the facts and circumstances. When
  it is contemplated that the dining facility will be closed or will undergo renovation, causing a
  drop in the number of members who can be accommodated, consideration should be given to
  designating alternate dining facilities. Those considerations could be: food costs to members
  in other on-base facilities, kitchen facilities in dorms, capacity of dining and alternate dining
  facilities, and a myriad of other considerations that the installation commander is in the best
  position to judge.
  6.8.6. Location of dining facility makes use impracticable. Commanding officers will
  determine when the location of a government mess, in relation to members' duty location,
  makes the use of the dining facility impracticable.
  6.8.7. Review of BAS:
     6.8.7.1. BAS Verification is an annual requirement, to be completed within, and not later
     than, twelve months after the date of the last verification. The FSO provides
     commanders with a listing, produced from DMO, identifying members who have meal
     charges collected from their pay. The FSO is not required to retain a copy of this listing
     since the Unit Commander is the OPR for BAS/ meal deduction authorization.
     6.8.7.2. The FSO provides the BAS verification listing, created via DMO, when
     requested by the Commander. The unit annotates the listing showing action required,
     identifying changes needed.
         6.8.7.2.1. On the listing but not assigned to unit. Prepare a letter to the FSO
         identifying these members so they can be placed under the correct unit.
         6.8.7.2.2. Not on the listing but assigned to unit. Prepare a letter to the FSO
         identifying these members so they can be placed under the correct unit.
         6.8.7.2.3. To further assist commanders in the review of their BAS program, a locally
         or MAJCOM-developed self inspection guide should be used. If one is unavailable,
         then Figure 6.6 will be used.
     6.8.7.3. DELETED.
         6.8.7.3.1. On the listing but not assigned to unit. Prepare a letter to the FSO
         identifying these members so they can be placed under the correct unit.
         6.8.7.3.2. Not on the listing but assigned to unit. Prepare a letter to the FSO
         identifying these members so they can be placed under the correct unit.
         6.8.7.3.3. To further assist commanders in the review of their BAS program, a locally
         or MAJCOM-developed self inspection guide should be used. If one is unavailable,
         then Figure 6.6 will be used.
  6.8.8. Meal Collections. All members must pay for any government meals furnished during
  any period in which they are also entitled to BAS unless receiving inpatient or outpatient
44                                                        AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


  health care services at a military treatment facility for injury, illness, or disease incurred in
  support of any operation designated by the Secretary of Defense as a combat operation or
  area designated as a combat zone. Payment may be made by the member at point of sale, by
  deduction from pay, or reduction in per diem. Certain assignments may require mandatory
  pay account collection for government furnished meals made available when the member is
  assigned to the essential station messing (ESM), essential unit messing (EUM), field duty, or
  group travel. DoDD 1418.05 requires that ESM be applied uniformly for all enlisted
  members permanently assigned to single Government quarters at the same installation,
  station, base or ship. Exceptions may be made only when assigned duties cause an individual
  to miss more than 20 percent of their meals the Government furnishes on a monthly basis.
  Members will be charged at 25 percent of the daily deduction rate for the first and last day of
  such an assignment. In cases where a member transitions from one mandatory collection
  status to another, the 25 percent charge, for the first day and last day of assignment, does not
  apply.
     6.8.8.1. Not collecting for meal charges. Enlisted members may receive BAS without
     meal deductions only when they are not furnished government meals or when granted
     permission to mess separately, unless provided meals by military treatment facilities (see
     6.8.8 above). Automatic authority to mess separately is granted to:
         6.8.8.1.1. E-7, E-8s, and E-9s.
         6.8.8.1.2. Enlisted member residing with dependents at the member’s permanent duty
         station (exception non-command sponsored dependents).
         6.8.8.1.3. Military couples assigned to the same installation or adjacent installations
         and maintaining common family quarters.
     6.8.8.2. Members who take leave, while assigned to situations where mandatory pay
     account collection is required, will have the meal collections suspended during any day of
     official leave. The 25 percent charge does not apply to the first and last day of leave.
     6.8.8.3. Enlisted members E1 through E6 permanently assigned to single government
     quarters are entitled to BAS and may be assigned to the ESM. Enlisted members
     assigned to ESM will be charged for meals made available while so assigned. Charges at
     the discount rate will be deducted from the member's pay account. If assigned duties or
     dining facility circumstances prevent government furnished meals from being provided,
     charges will be adjusted for affected meals. Members assigned to ESM will not have
     meal collections deducted from pay when on leave, permanent change of station (PCS),
     hospitalization, or temporary duty (TDY) (other than TDY to field duty, EUM, or group
     travel). All members performing field duty in EUM status or group travel status, while
     assigned to single government quarters, may be charged for all government meals made
     available. Charges at the discount rate may be deducted from the member's pay account.
     If members are TDY, assigned to a joint task force (JTF) operational deployment under
     the rules cited in the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR, Volume 1, paragraph
     U4800), not receiving the meals portion of the M&EI (resulting in a $2.00/$3.50 per
     diem rate), meal charges are not collected from military pay.
  6.8.9. Blanket Authorization.
     6.8.9.1. Enlisted members 37 through 39 are exempt from assignment to ESM.
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                 45


     6.8.9.2. In 1999, a determination of impracticability was made for enlisted controllers in
     Air Force Command Posts, Wing Operation Centers, and Higher Headquarter Command
     Centers. Enlisted controllers are authorized full BAS without automatically being placed
     on ESM upon arrival at their permanent duty stations. Commanders will retain the
     authority to remove a member from ESM if it is determined to be in the best interests of
     the member and the Air Force.
  6.8.10. Family Subsistence Supplemental Allowance (FSSA). Once a member completes the
  application, it must go to the commander (or a commander on G-series orders with command
  responsibility) for approval. The commander’s support staff is responsible for the FSSA
  computation prior to the commander’s approval of the allowance.
     6.8.10.1. BAS policy for members, E1 through E6, permanently assigned to single
     government quarters, allows the commander to authorize full BAS, without meal charge
     deduction, when a member cannot utilize the mess for at least 80 percent of his/her meals
     on a regular basis. When a member is assigned to such duties, commanders may
     recommend removal from the ESM or exemption from the ESM if the installation, base,
     or station commander in charge of the dining facility and single quarters concurs with the
     recommendation (ref. 6.10., AF Form 220).
     6.8.10.2. The 80 Percent Rule. ESM must be applied uniformly for all enlisted members
     permanently assigned to single-type government quarters at the same installation.
     Exceptions may be made only when assigned duties prevent a member from being
     provided at least 80 percent of their government meals on a regular basis. To illustrate,
     using a 30-day month, there are 90 government meals made available (3 x 30). A
     percentage break down results in:
     1.      90 meals (80%) = 72 meals
     2.      90 meals (20%) = 18 meals

  If a member consistently misses more than 18 meals per month, the commander may
  consider removing the member from ESM and allow BAS without deduction. Commanders
  are required to demonstrate that members not subject to ESM are missing meals due to
  assigned duties on a consistent basis.

      6.8.10.8. DELETED.
   6.8.11. Verbal Order of the Commanding Officer (VOCO).
      6.8.11.1. Authority to mess separately cannot be granted retroactively. However, a claim
      is authorized if authority was previously granted. Reasons for such a claim may include
      lost, damaged, or lack of access to, AF Form 220. All claims require completion of
      Section II, block 4, of the 220, ensuring a ―verbal order of the Commanding Officer‖
      (VOCO) date is entered. The VOCO date is the date the entitlement was originally
      authorized.
      6.8.11.2. If the claim is within 90 days of the effective date and the original approving
      authority, usually the Unit Commander, remains unchanged, the AF Form 220 is
      prepared and approved/signed by the Unit Commander.
      6.8.11.3. If the claim extends beyond a period of 90 days, or if the original approving
      authority has changed, the AF Form 220 is prepared and must be approved/signed by
      either the Base or Wing Commander, Group Commander, Deputy, or Deputy
      Commander for Resource Management (DCR) for bases under tri-deputy structure.
6.9. Substantiating Documents.

      BAS.
      6.9.2.2. AF Form 220. Complete as in Figure 6-4. Use this form to start and stop BAS
      through the FSO. In most cases, BAS will already be started and will only require a
      change in type or a stop. However, in certain situations (see 6.8), a BAS start may be
      necessary. Annotate in the ―reason for request‖ block the reason the member is to be
      paid a different type of BAS or, when stopping meal collections, the reason to
      discontinue the meal collections. After request by the commander, and approval as
      required in 6.8 above, the unit keeps a copy of the AF Form 220 and sends original and
      one copy to the FSO. One copy goes to food services for the purpose of adding or
      deleting a member from SIMS. The unit’s copy of the AF Form 220 is compared to the
      daily register of transactions (DROT) to verify action was taken. File the 220, along with
      a copy of all supporting documentation, in the unit’s personnel information files and
      retain until the AF Form 220 is superseded, or the member is reassigned or separated (Air
      Force Records Disposition Schedule).

      original of the determination is attached to the original DD Form 1475 for the first month
      of a recurring entitlement, or each time for a one-time entitlement, and files a copy in the
      unit files. Approving authority prepares monthly and sends original and one copy of DD
      Form 1475 to FSO.

  6.10.4. Additional Information. DFAS will process the allowance start, for members who
  have been identified by the 15th of the month, in time to have the allowance included in the
  member’s end of month pay (EOM). Submissions received after the 15th will be reflected in
  the next month’s EOM pay. FSSA will be reflected on the MMPA as an ―09‖ entry, FID 40.
  Spreadsheets must be compiled and sent on a monthly basis to arrive before the 15th to
  minimize the email traffic at central site.
  6.10.5. Members Arriving PCS. When a member arrives PCS, the gaining FSO is
  responsible for notifying DFAS (see paragraph 6.10.2 above) of the date arrived on station.
  DFAS will stop the FSSA effective the day prior to the date of arrival at the new station. The
  member may reapply/recertify at the new duty station through the same process discussed in
  paragraph 6.10 above.
  6.10.6. Promotions. When a promotion is processed on a member who is receiving FSSA,
  DFAS will stop the allowance effective the day prior to the effective date of the promotion.
  If the member questions why the allowance stopped, send him/her to the commander for
  information concerning reapplication.
  6.10.7. Annual Recertification. Recertification follows the same procedures as initial
  application. Members must recertify under the following circumstances (if member
  participates in other income assistance programs, notification of those agencies is necessary
  as well):

     the period from the 30 days prior to 1 February to 30 days after 1 February.
     6.10.7.2. Any change to household. An increase or decrease to household size could

       6.10.7.3. When monthly income increases by $100 or more, as compared to the current
       certified amount. Increases in income less than $100 per month will not affect

       certify to restart entitlement to FSSA.
       6.10.7.5. When a member goes PCS, FSSA eligibility terminates the day prior to the date
       member officially checks into the new duty station.
   6.10.8. Overpayments. Member is accountable for FSSA overpayments. Overpayments are

   responsibility for the member initiate health and appearance sales. These credit sales are
   authorized only to cover emergency needs of airmen who are without funds to purchase items
   of personal clothing necessary for health, comfort, or appearance. Use of credit sales to make
   up shortages for an inspection is not an emergency. Credit sales are not authorized if member
   can wait until regular pay and allowances are received.
   6.13.2. Action by Unit Commander or Other Individual on G-Series Orders With Command
   Responsibility for the member. Contact servicing FSO to determine if member has enough
   pay accrued to cover purchase. If enough pay has accrued, send member to FSO for a partial
   payment to purchase required clothing. If enough pay has not accrued, prepare AF Form 656
   or AF Form 657 to authorize the credit sale. Collection is on a one-time basis unless
   commander determines amortization is necessary, and certifies on AF Form 656 or AF Form
   657 that amortization is required.

   member's need for a credit sale, unit prepares AF Form 656 or AF Form 657. Airman
   presents form to clothing sales store when selecting required items. Clothing Sales store
   enters amount of purchases on the form and returns it to the airman who presents it to the
   FSO before clothing is released by clothing sales store. (AFMAN 67-1, Part Three, Chapter

      deposit fund, the correction facility makes a withdrawal to pay for the health and
      appearance sale.
      6.13.4.2. Prisoner in a Pay Status. Cost of supplies is charged against the prisoner's
      military pay account. FSO makes a partial payment to the member and reports the
      payment to DFAS-DE.

   6.15.1. Categories of Indebtedness:
      6.15.1.1. Overpayments of allotments.
      6.15.1.2. Overpayments of pay and allowances.
      6.15.1.3. Computer generated indebtedness; usually the result of processing retroactive
      transactions.
      6.15.1.4. Reimbursement to United States Government other than pay and allowances,
      allotments, and non-governmental debts.
   6.15.2. Notice to Debtor. An indebted member is notified by servicing FSO or the holder of
   the debt, and is requested to repay amount in full or furnish a proposed method of repayment.
   If the member's debt is less than the net pay for the month and full deduction creates a
   hardship, the member may have the debt prorated if the unit commander or other individual
   on G-Series orders with command responsibility for the member approves. The commander
   sends a letter to the servicing FSO requesting a proposed method of collection. Absence of
   this letter causes the debt to be collected in one month. This does not apply if the debt is
   larger than one month's net pay or if a one-month deduction would exceed the two-thirds
   rule. Servicing FSO also advises member of right to appeal, and to apply for remission or
   waiver and cancellation of debt. If member does not promptly repay full amount or propose a
   method of repayment not later than (NLT) month debt is ascertained, DFAS-DE or FSO
   establishes a repayment rate and advises the member.
   6.15.3. Collection. In collecting indebtedness from other than final pay, Air Force policy is
   that amount deducted for any period must not exceed two-thirds of pay except when a
   member agrees to have a greater amount deducted. The minimum monthly repayment is
   generally $50 unless a reduced amount is justified in writing due to financial hardship. In no
   case is the monthly repayment reduced below $25 per month. Member and dependents are
   not deprived of means to buy necessities. When possible, DFAS-DE collects at a rate
   requested by member. Deductions are not set at amount greater than net pay due member.
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                 53


  6.15.4. Administratively Ascertained Indebtedness More Than Two-Thirds Pay (Airmen):
     6.15.4.1. Notice to member. By management notices, DFAS-DE notifies member
     through servicing FSO to stop voluntary allotments when member is in an overpaid
     status. FSO is responsible for stopping allotments no later than the month after current
     month.
     6.15.4.2. Commander. When an airman's debt exceeds two-thirds of his or her monthly
     pay, debt may be collected at a rate of two-thirds of monthly pay.
  6.15.5. Debt of Less Than Two-Thirds Pay (Airmen). When an airman's debt is less than
  two-thirds of one month's pay, commander may authorize smaller monthly deduction if
  hardship is involved, provided total debt is liquidated before member's current term of
  service expires. The member submits AF Form 2451, Financial Statement-Remission of
  Indebtedness, through the unit commander or other individual on G-Series orders with
  command responsibility for the member to the servicing FSO with the commander's
  recommendation to approve or disapprove.
  6.15.6. Dishonored Checks-Base Exchange. Managers of Army and Air Force Exchange
  Service (AAFES) facilities have authority to issue DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment
  Authorization, to effect involuntary collection of dishonored checks cashed by Air Force
  personnel in AAFES facilities. This authority is in AFJI 34-210, paragraphs 6-15 and 6-18.
  However, before an AAFES manager can issue a DD Form 139, manager must comply with
  requirements of DoDFMR, Table 50-5, rule 6, column E. After AAFES manager has tried all
  means of direct collection from member, and a request has been sent to unit commander or
  other individual on G-Series orders with command responsibility for the member for
  assistance in obtaining direct payment, and member has refused to make direct payment to
  AAFES facility after counsel by commander, AAFES facility manager can then issue DD
  Form139. The form shows that above requirements have been completed. Waiver or appeal
  procedures do not apply when indebtedness is result of a dishonored check. Commander
  must advise the AAFES facility manager in writing, that member has been counseled and
  deduction can be made from the member's pay account unless the member immediately
  repays the dishonored check to the BX. Member should also indicate concurrence with the
  payroll deduction on the return letter.
  6.15.7. Dishonored Checks-Commissary. Any dishonored check payable to Treasury of the
  United States and endorsed by commissary is not subject to pro-ration (DoDFMR, Table 50-
  5.) Commissary manager must work with unit commander or other individual on G-Series
  orders with command responsibility for the member in making collection.
  6.15.8. Dishonored Checks Involving Non-Appropriated Funds. Any dishonored checks
  payable to, and endorsed by, any non-appropriated fund activity are subject to pro-ration.
  (DoDFMR, Table 50-5). When an indebtedness occurs, before the non-appropriated fund
  instrumentality (NAFI) can issue a DD Form 139, they must comply with requirements of
  DoDFMR, Table 50-5. The member is notified by the Non-Appropriated Fund Accounting
  Office (NAF-AO) concerned and asked to make payment for the amount of the debt. If the
  member refuses, does not make payment, or does not respond, the NAFFMB notifies the
  member's unit commander for assistance in collection of the debt. If the member is separating
  within 30 days, notification to the unit commander or other individual on G-Series orders
 54                                                      AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


   with command responsibility for the member is waived. The NAFFMB prepares a Form 139
   and forwards it to the member's servicing FSO.
   6.15.9. Dishonored Checks-FSO. In certain areas, FSOs have been granted authority to cash
   checks for members where banking facilities are not available. Any indebtedness caused by a
   dishonored check of this type is not subject to pro-ration.
6.16. Appealing Indebtedness. A member may appeal validity of debt, amount, or rate of
payment.
   6.16.1. Time Limit. Member must appeal within 30 days of date of debt notice (45 days if
   member is served by a GSU or before transfer or separation, if this occurs earlier). If an
   airman's appeal is denied by DFAS-DE, DFAS-DE then considers debt for remission and
   cancellation without further information from base, provided information required by
   paragraph 6.15 has been furnished with appeal.

          6.16.2.1.3. Evidence refuting debt, including documents, receipts, correspondence,
          and description of circumstances, or events for which verifying evidence is not
          available. If member has evidence not immediately available, describe it and state

          organizations, and other information as exactly as possible.
      6.16.2.2. Rate of Repayment. The repayment rate is established by DFAS-DE or local

6.18. Collections of Indebtedness Upon Discharge and Immediate Reenlistment. These
rules apply:
   6.18.1. Members indebted to United States may agree, on discharge and immediate
   reenlistment, to partial collection action during new enlistment if:
      6.18.1.1. Full collection of debt before discharge would require total or nearly total
      stoppage of final pay;
      6.18.1.2. Total or nearly total stoppage of final pay would create hardship for member
      and his or her dependents; and
      6.18.1.3. There is reasonable prospect of collecting debt in full from later active duty
      pay.
   6.18.2. Member must submit AF Form 2451 to FSO through unit commander or other
   individual on G-Series orders with command responsibility for the member at least 30 days
   before discharge and immediate reenlistment. Request must indicate that member is
   reenlisting upon discharge and show that:
      6.18.2.1. Full collection of debt from final pay would create undue hardship for member
      and dependents; and
      6.18.2.2. There is reasonable assurance of collecting debt in full within period of active
      duty for which member is reenlisting.
   6.18.3. Such requests should state:

   "I request that debt be carried forward to new period of service. I propose repayment at rate
      of      $____ per month for ____ months in new enlistment. Collection of this debt in
      full, upon discharge, from final pay creates a serious financial hardship."

   (Grade) (Signature of Member) (SSN)

   (Organization of Assignment)
   6.18.4. On receipt of member's request for extension of collection into new enlistment, FSO
   determines whether proposed monthly rate of repayment is acceptable. If not acceptable,
   FSO establishes a new rate in a reasonable amount of time that does not create undue
   hardship but adequately protects the interests of the government and satisfies the debt at the
   earliest practicable date. Monthly deductions must be at least $50. FSO advises member of
   approved rate of monthly deduction.
   6.18.5. If debt is to be carried forward into new enlistment, FSO suspends final payment
   until evidence is received showing member has reenlisted.
 56                                                        AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


6.19. Liquidation of Debt by Installments (Officers). An officer who wishes to liquidate a
debt to the United States by monthly installments sends a written request for the right to do so to
the servicing FSO. When a request must be forwarded by FSO to DFAS-DE for approval, officer
must include AF Form 2451 showing financial position, maximum regular deduction officer can
afford, and anticipated remaining period of active duty. Requests are sent to DFAS-DE for
approval when:
   6.19.1. Proposed installments are less than $50 or are only token payments;
   6.19.2. Debt is not paid before officer's tour of duty expires (unless collection from retired
   pay is indicated (DoDFMR, Chapters 44 through 54)); or
   6.19.3. In the opinion of FSO, interest of the government is not adequately protected.

  6.22.4. Social Security Numbers (SSN):
     6.22.4.1. Requirement. Each member on active duty or performing active duty for
     training must have a SSN. This number is the member's service identification number
     (AFI 36-3203).
     6.22.4.2. Change of Name. To record a change of name with the Social Security
     Administration, the member must submit a Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security
     Number Card (original, replacement, correction), to the nearest Social Security
     Administration Office, or MPF, if overseas.
  6.22.5. Requirements and Purpose of TD Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Allowance
  Certificate:
     6.22.5.1. Form W-4. When a member first reports for duty he or she prepares and
     submits a TD Form W-4, in duplicate, to the MPF. Whenever a member's tax status
     changes, the member must submit a TD Form W-4 to the FSO. Information shown on the
     TD Form W-4 is used to establish or change FITW and State Income Tax Withheld
     (SITW) wage and deduction factors on a member's Master Military Pay Account
     (MMPA).
     6.22.5.2. Tax Exemption. Withholding of federal and, or state income tax is not required
     when a member certifies that he or she incurred no tax liability for preceding year and
     expects no tax liability for the current year. Member must prepare, sign, and submit a TD
     Form W-4 to the servicing FSO each year to continue to have no withholding from FITW
     and, or SITW. A new TD Form W-4 must be submitted by 15 February each year to
     continue tax exemption.

 58                                                       AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


          6.22.5.3.1. Authorization. Member may specify an additional amount of tax to be
          withheld on a TD Form W-4.
          6.22.5.3.2. Voluntary Termination. Member may stop additional withholding at any

   6.22.6. Combat Zone Wage Exclusion. Entitlement to combat zone exclusion of taxable
   wages is established based on provisions of the DoDFMR.
   6.22.7. Taxable Income. Current year taxable wages are adjusted when prior year taxable
   wages are collected in current year. Taxable income is computed based on transactions
   occurring in a given tax period. Taxable entitlements are reported on the member's TD Form
   W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, for the year credited to the members account. Taxes withheld
   are reported on the member's TD Form W-2 year in which they are withheld.
6.23. Court-Martial Sentences and Non-Judicial Punishment.
   6.23.1. Effect. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, Chapters 48 and 49 for effect of court-martial
   sentences and non-judicial punishment on pay and allowances.
   6.23.2. Requirements. Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) is
   implemented by AFI 51-202, Non-judicial Punishment Under Article 15, UCMJ. The
   regulation explains who may impose non-judicial punishment and provides rules and
   procedures for imposing such punishment on Air Force members, wherever assigned. It also
   requires commanders to seek advice of Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) before imposing
   punishment, provides for military legal counsel in all cases where requested by the offender,
   requires commanders to attach reasons for not suspending a reduction, and requires, where a
   vacation hearing is held, that a summary of the matters considered by the commander is
   attached to proceedings. The effective date of the Article 15 punishment, when the
   punishment is reduction in grade or forfeiture, is the date of the endorsement that imposes the
   punishment. If the member appeals the Article 15, the punishment is stayed until the appeal
   is decided. If the appeal is denied, the effective date of the punishment remains the date of
   the endorsement that imposed the punishment (AFI 51-202). However, if the member appeals
   and is within 30 days of separation, the collection is not held up pending action on the appeal
   (AFI 51-202).

          6.23.3.1.2. Servicing FSO - one copy, to be used only as an advance (memo)
          document.
      6.23.3.2. Convening Authority. Immediately informs servicing FSO, by electrical
      transmission, when sentence results in:
          6.23.3.2.1. Total forfeiture of pay and allowances.
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                    59


          6.23.3.2.2. Discharge. When member's pay status ends day before date sentence
          begins. For a summary court-martial, no court-martial orders are issued. Convening
          authority sends original and one copy of record of trial to MPF and one copy to
          servicing FSO.
          6.23.3.2.3. Servicing FSO. Processes input to update MMPA.
   6.23.4. Court-Martial Orders (CMO). Number court-martial orders in sequence on a
   calendar-year basis. Judge Advocate (JA) furnishes two copies of all CMOs to the servicing
   FSO as supporting document for MMPA update, and one copy to DFAS-DE/FJP, Denver CO
   80279-3000 for quality control. Forward CMO record to FSO by AF Form 1373, MPO
   Document Control Log-Transmittal (Figure 1.1). Prepare AF Form 1373 in an original and
   one copy. FSO acknowledges receipt by furnishing a DROT to JA showing transactions input
   by JA (as input source). This provides evidence that action has been started and transactions
   have processed to member's MMPA.
   6.23.5. Article 15 Correspondence. JA furnishes FSO with two signed copies of AF Form
   3070, Record of Non-judicial Punishment Proceedings or AF Form 3071, Record of
   Recommended Non-judicial Punishment Proceedings, with the endorsement showing the
   date the commander imposed the punishment (excluding evidence material). Forward
   correspondence by AF Form 1373. Preparation and distribution are same as in C6.23.5
   above. Continue to process Article 15 correspondence not affecting member's pay and
   summarized records of punishment per AFI 51-202. JA also forwards the paperwork to the
   FSO if the member has appealed the punishment. The punishment does not start until action
   has been finalized on the appeal unless the member is within 30 days of discharge.
   6.23.6. Priority Handling. Give all CMOs, SCM records, and Article 15 correspondence
   priority handling. Do not hold or delay distribution.
6.24. Contributory Educational Programs. Both the Veterans Educational Assistance
Program (VEAP) and Montgomery G.I. Bill (MGIB) are contributory educational programs.
   6.24.1. VEAP. To be eligible for VEAP members must have first entered active duty
   between 1 January 1977 and 30 June 1985 and enrolled by contributing a minimum of $25.
   6.24.2. MGIB. To be eligible for MGIB members must have first entered active duty on or
   after 1 July 1985. During the first 14 days of active duty they make an election on DD Form
   2366 to either participate in the program or decline participation. The decision is irrevocable
   and the contribution is non-refundable. Members participating will have basic pay reduced
   by $100 per month for 12 months for a total contribution of $1200. Usually this pay
   reduction begins during the third month of active duty and automatically stops when $1200
   has been withheld. All questions concerning eligibility for MGIB or program benefits should
   be referred to your local education office.

Section 6E—Status.

6.25. Return from Overseas to CONUS-Separated at Base Other than a Separation Port
Facility. If a member returns to CONUS or is moved from one overseas base to another for
terminal leave in connection with retirement:
 60                                                      AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


   6.25.1. Losing Unit. Prepares AF IMT 988, leaving blocks entitled Leave Auth. No., Unit,
   Duty Section, Duty Location, and Duty Phone, blank. Enter the statement "Terminal Leave"
   on top of the form. Inform member to report to gaining FSO, immediately upon arrival, at
   base designated to process retirement.
   6.25.2. Certifying Officer. Unit commander or other individual on G-Series orders with
   command responsibility for the member indicates approval by signing in the Supervisor's
   Signature block. Send all copies to MPF for inclusion in member's records for transmittal to
   CONUS processing base.
   6.25.3. CONUS Processing Unit. Completes AF IMT 988 and forwards to the local FSO for
   processing.
6.26. Permanent Change of Station (PCS). FSO reports PCS arrival of member based on
travel itinerary.
   6.26.1. Geographically Separated Units (GSU). Where distance between FSO and unit is
   such that forwarding of travel voucher to FSO would delay processing PCS arrival
   transaction, member's unit sends a message containing all data that would be available from
   travel voucher to FSO. When this procedure is used, travel voucher must still be forwarded to
   FSO and must be part of substantiating documents for FSO files.
   6.26.2. Failure to Report at Gaining Base and Late Arrival. Losing unit is responsible for
   member until member reports to new unit (AFI 36-2911, paragraph 7-22). Thus, if a member
   is determined to be absent without leave (AWOL), losing personnel office submits a regular
   AWOL input based on AF Form 2098, Duty Status Change, prepared by the unit. If member
   reports to new station, process an AF Form 2098, placing member in an on-station status.
6.27. Other Status Processing. Member's losing FSO is responsible for making sure the
member's former unit prepares, numbers, and sends the AF Form 2098 to personnel; personnel
updates their system which sends update transactions to DJMS. AF Form 2098 is the basic
source document used to return a member to one of the following statuses:
   6.27.1. On-station (present for duty).
   6.27.2. Absent Without Leave (AWOL). These special procedures must be applied:
      6.27.2.1. The orderly room (Squadron Commander or First Sergeant) must advise the
      FSO, by telephone, of any member declared AWOL.
      6.27.2.2. If an AWOL absence was reported to DFAS-DE and later excused as
      unavoidable and absence is chargeable to leave, member’s unit prepares necessary
      documents to charge absence to leave.
      6.27.2.3. Gaining unit or any military installation must inform losing unit of member’s
      status or failure to report under PCS orders (AFI 36-2911). Contact DFAS for identity of
      losing unit if unknown.
   6.27.3. Desertion. If member’s command excuses absence as unavoidable and absence is
   chargeable to leave, member’s unit prepares documents to charge absence to leave.
   6.27.4. Member hospitalized in a non-military facility.
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                    61

          (None) in space provided for amount. Member signs the form. Give the form to the
          FSO. After certification, FSO returns original to member or, if member is absent, to
          dependent named. NOTE: Also, use DD Form 1337 to designate individual to whom

     evacuation allowances authorized in Joint Travel Regulations (JFTR), Volume I,
     Chapter 12, may be paid.
     6.29.2.2.3. Final Phase. When evacuation has been ordered, dependents request
     payment for evacuation allowance per Figure 6.7 Dependents entitled to receive
     dependent travel allowance and per diem are required to complete DD Form 1351-2,
     Travel Voucher or Sub-voucher.
     6.29.2.2.4. Waiver of Right of Recovery:
        6.29.2.2.4.1. General Information. SAF may waive recovery of not more than one
        month's basic pay advance to member's dependents under 37 U.S.C. 1006(c).
        Requests submitted by members for waiver under this authority are adjudicated
        on a case-by-case basis. Where evacuation and dislocation allowances are paid as
        a result of emergency evacuation, waiver application must show that these
        allowances were insufficient to pay unusual expenses of sudden evacuation. This
        includes reasonable expenses incurred for rental of furniture and an automobile as
        a result of delayed arrival of these items. Usually, purchase of these items as a
        result of evacuation is not regarded as sufficient reason for waiver of one month's
        advance pay since individual has permanent possession and use of them. Unusual
        circumstances where evacuation caused financial hardship should be submitted if
        it can be shown that recovery of full amount advanced is contrary to equity and
        good conscience under 37 U.S.C. 1006(c).
        6.29.2.2.4.2. Killed or Missing in Action. When a member is killed or reported
        missing in action incident to emergency condition which caused ordered
        evacuation of dependents, consider waiver of recovery of not more than one
        month's basic pay advanced as an emergency allowance, without request.
        6.29.2.2.4.3. Limitation. Only one month's basic pay at rate for member's pay
        grade at time emergency evacuation payment was authorized, or unpaid balance,
        may be waived. Any amount withheld from member's pay for application against
        advance of pay is considered recovered.
        6.29.2.2.4.4. Notification of Rights. Member's servicing FSO advises member of
        right to apply for waiver of recovery of an emergency evacuation payment as
        soon as possible after such FSO makes payment or receives notification from
        DFAS-DE that payment was made by another FSO. Application for waiver may
        be initiated by member or unit commander or other individual on G-Series orders
        with command responsibility for the member.
        6.29.2.2.4.5. Remission. Disapproval of an enlisted member's request for waiver
        does not affect his or her right to apply for remission under provisions of
        paragraph 6.15
     6.29.2.2.5. Application for Waiver of Recovery:
        6.29.2.2.5.1. Preparation, Documentation, and Submission. Application, prepared
        by member or unit commander or other individual on G-Series orders with
        command responsibility for the member, should be in letter form and must
        include:

              6.29.2.2.5.1.8.8. Expenses as a result of non-availability of service facilities
              (doctor, dentist, hospital, etc.).
              6.29.2.2.5.1.8.9. Loss of personal or private property not otherwise
              compensated for.

 64                                                      AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


                  evacuation.
              6.29.2.2.5.2. Action by Commander.         Commander forwards letter, with
              attachments, to FSO for action and submission to DFAS.
              6.29.2.2.5.3. DFAS Action. DFAS evaluates application for waiver and transmits
              to SAF for final action; prepares input to delete debt, if waived; if not waived,
              resumes collection action; notifies FSO of final action and FSO advises member.
   6.29.3. Briefing Before Deployment:
       6.29.3.1. Major Commands. Any command or element of a command which expects to
       be involved in a deployment operation must make pre-deployment preparations promptly.
       Major commands are responsible for giving base commanders necessary information and
       instruction about deployment.
       6.29.3.2. Unit. Unit must make sure members alerted for deployment duty and all
       potential deployment personnel are scheduled for pay briefing by FSO.
6.30. Procedures for Jury Duty Fees.
   6.30.1. Conditions. Active duty military members may be required to perform jury duty. If
   the member is in a leave status when performing the jury duty, he or she may keep any jury
   fees received. If, however, the member was not in leave status or on scheduled off-duty time,
   the member may not retain the jury fees (as distinguished from expenses). The member must
   turn in such fees to the Military Pay area of the financial services office (FSO). They can be
   involuntarily collected from the current pay of officers and enlisted members by the FSO.
   (DoDFMR), Table 50-4.)
   6.30.2. Fees Versus Expenses. The member may keep monies received and identified as for
   expenses (for example, transportation expenses) whether or not they are in a leave status or
   on scheduled off-duty time. The court documents (for example, order, subpoena, summons,
   official requests, etc.) received by the member may be used by the FSO to determine whether
   the court paid a jury fee or expense. If the FSO has a question, he or she may contact the
   local judge advocate office for assistance in making a determination. Many state courts use
   an expense allowance reimbursement system rather than fees. Therefore, members
   performing jury duty in these courts would receive no fees requiring collections.
   6.30.3. Action by Immediate Supervisor. Immediate supervisor informs the member of the
   rules governing jury duty fees as described in paragraphs 6.30.1 and 6.30.2 In addition,
   informs the FSO whenever a member is granted an excused absence from scheduled duty
   time not involving leave for jury duty so the FSO, in turn, can establish a follow-up suspense
   to ensure the member turns in any fees received.
   6.30.4. Action by Unit. The unit makes the immediate supervisors aware of their
   responsibility to inform the members and the FSO as described in paragraph 6.30.3
   6.30.5. Witness Fees. The collection of witness fees received by military members serving as
   a witness is the same as the collection of jury duty fees received by military members. The
   procedures in paragraphs 6.30.1., 6.30.2., 6.30.3, and 6.30.4 above apply.
6.31. PCS Advance Pay. DD Form 2560, Advance Pay Certification/Authorization (Figure
6.8), along with a copy of the PCS orders or PCS assignment notification, documents a member's
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                  65


request for, and authorization of, an advance of pay to meet extraordinary expenses related to a
PCS move. In cases where the actual PCS order has not been produced, a copy of the PCS
assignment notification ("rip sheet") may be used in lieu of the actual orders.
   6.31.1. Purpose. The purpose of an advance pay incident to a PCS is to provide a service
   member with funds to meet the extraordinary expenses of a Government-ordered relocation.
   It is intended to assist with out-of-pocket expenses that exceed or precede reimbursements
   incurred in a duty location change, and are expenses that are not typical of day-to-day
   military living. An advance of basic pay incident to a PCS shall not be authorized for the
   specific out-of-pocket expenses covered by advances of other pays and entitlements, if such
   advances are used. To the extent that incurred or anticipated expenses exceed those covered
   by the following advances or reimbursements, or are outside of the scope of those
   entitlements, the service member may be authorized an advance of basic pay:
       6.31.1.1. Service member and/or dependent travel allowances and per diem.
       6.31.1.2. Overseas housing allowance.
       6.31.1.3. Basic allowance for housing.
       6.31.1.4. Dislocation Allowance. PCS advances are not intended to provide funds for
       items such as investments, vacations, or the purchase of consumer goods not the direct
       result of expenses of the PCS. Advance pay may be used for such items as house-hunting
       trip expenses, the down payment on a house, excess household goods charges, consumer
       goods necessary for the PCS move, or the support of two households, etc.
   6.31.2. Limitations:
       6.31.2.1. Amount:
           6.31.2.1.1. An amount equal to one month's basic pay less deductions as defined in
           6.31.2.1.2 below, or
           6.31.2.1.2. The total of expenses related to the PCS and not covered by advances
           listed above (paragraphs 6.31.1.1 through 6.31.1.4), but may not exceed three months'
           basic pay less deductions for federal and state income tax withholding, armed forces
           retirement home, federal insurance contribution act tax, servicemen's group life
           insurance, all known debts, Montgomery G.I. Bill (MGIB), monthly repayment of a
           prior advance, forfeitures, dependent dental plan, garnishments, court-ordered
           bankruptcy payment, and statutorily required support allotments in force. Example:
           member is an E5 (SSGT) with over 12 years' service. The following items should be
           considered from the leave and earnings statement:

BASIC PAY:                               $1,571.40
Less: FICA                                   97.43
Medicare                                     22.79
FITW                                        203.46
SITW                                         53.04
SGLI                                          3.60

DEP DENTAL                                  7.86
DEBT TO GOVT                               62.30
TOTAL:                                 $1,120.42

            6.31.2.1.2.1. This total equals the amount of 1 month's basic pay less deductions
            for the maximum advance to which a member is entitled with no justification.
            Maximum advance payable with justification (3 x $1,120.42) $3,361.26.
            6.31.2.1.2.2. No advance is authorized for a PCS move in the same geographic
            area of a service member's prior duty station or place from which ordered to
            active duty unless the member is authorized to move household effects at
            government expense. Proof of actual or impending HHG shipment is required
            before the advance may be paid.
            6.31.2.1.2.3. No member may have an advance in excess of three months' basic
            pay less deductions at any time.
            6.31.2.1.2.4. A member may receive the advance pay in one lump sum or in up to
            three installments. Repayment must begin the month after the first installment is
            received. Additionally, a member may receive less than the full amount
            authorized and later request an additional amount (up to a total of three months'
            basic pay less deductions and any other advances) with commander approval if
            actual or anticipated expenses warrant. Repayment amounts are adjusted to
            accommodate additional installments as received. Member may be paid the
            advance:
                6.31.2.1.2.4.1. Within 30 days of PCS or 60 days after reporting to the next
                permanent duty station (PDS) (no commander approval required for SrA and
                above).
                6.31.2.1.2.4.2. Thirty-one to 90 days before PCS with approval of
                commander.
                6.31.2.1.2.4.3. Sixty-one to 180 days after arrival at PDS with a letter of
                justification (attached to the DD Form 2560) signed by the member and
                endorsed by the commander.
            6.31.2.1.2.5. Repayment Period. An advance must be repaid in 12 months unless
            the member requests a shorter repayment period or an extended repayment from
            13-24 months is approved by the commander when fully justified by compelling
            reasons of hardship. In no case may the repayment period exceed the number of
            months to member's DOS or tour length, whichever is less.
            6.31.2.1.2.6. Permissive PCS Moves. Members who have received PCS orders
            for a permissive PCS move are entitled to a PCS advance pay for substantiated
            expenses related to the PCS. If, however, the move is within the same geographic
            area, restrictions outlined in 6.3.1.2.1.2.2. above apply.
  6.31.3. Repayment Guidelines. Commanders may use procedures in this subparagraph to
  help determine appropriate repayment periods. The member's "debt to the net earnings" ratio
  (to the nearest whole percentage point) should be considered in approving an extended
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                  67


  repayment period. Determine the amount in 6.31.2.1.2. plus other entitlements (BAS, BAH,
  FSA, Special Duty Pays, etc.). This is the "net earnings." Determine the debt figure by
  adding expenses for rent or mortgage payments, consumer loan payments, and recurring
  charge payments. Do not include utility bills, food, clothing, insurance, or allotments.
  Divide the debt figure by the net earnings figure to determine the debt to net earnings ratio.
     6.31.3.1. An example follows using an E5 with over 12 years' service:
             1 month advance payable:             $1,120.42
             Plus: BAH                               405.60
                    BAS                              210.80
                    Special Pay                      150.00
             Total Net                             1,886.82
             Less: Rent                              450.00
                    Car Payment                      240.00
                    Charge Pmts                      100.00
             Total Debts                          $ 790.00

         6.31.3.1.1. $790 divided by $1,886.82 = 42 percent of net. This member may spread
         repayment of the advance over a 24-month period, since the debt to net ratio is 41
         percent or more.
     6.31.3.2. Commanders should use the above table as a guideline only, adjusting as
     necessary for special situations, such as when the member is required to support four or
     more dependents or is maintaining dual households due to geographical separation of the
     member and dependents.
     6.31.3.3. The minimum monthly repayment amount should be at the rate of one-twelfth
     of the amounts advanced, unless the member justifies the collection would create severe
     financial hardship in which case it would be collected at the rate of one-twenty-fourth of
     the amounts advanced for the next twenty-four months (see DoDFMR, Vol 7A, Table 32-
     2, rules 1 and 2).
     6.31.3.4. Members may make cash payments to repay an advance in full or partially at
     any time.
  6.31.4. Commander's Responsibility. It is the responsibility of the commander to review DD
  Form 2560 for all E3 and below, and parts IV and V for all personnel (who request more than
  one month's pay or more than 12 months repayment) and make sure all expenses and debts
  claimed are reasonable, necessary, in conformance with subparagraph 6.31.1 above, and
  supported by documentation. This responsibility may not be delegated.
  6.31.5. Comptroller Responsibility:
     6.31.5.1. The comptroller makes sure the intent of policy guidance is followed, providing
     guidance to wing and, or base commanders and unit commander or other individual on
     G-Series orders with command responsibility for the member as needed.
     6.31.5.2. Comptroller representatives review DD Forms 2560 prior to payment. The
     comptroller or FSO (or deputy FSO in absence of comptroller and FSO) should point out
     any questionable expenses or repayment periods to the commander for possible
68                                                    AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


     adjustments. Comptroller or FSOs are authorized to deduct from the advance pay
     requests any expenses that are specifically prohibited by subparagraph 6.31.1 above.
  6.31.6. Completion of DD Form 2560:
     6.31.6.1. The member must:
        6.31.6.1.1. Read and complete Part I - Request and Part IV - Member Certification.
        6.31.6.1.2. Complete Part II-Certification of Expenses, and Part V-Approval of unit
        commander or other individual on G-Series orders with command responsibility for
        the member, if requesting more than one months basic pay, payback over more than
        12 months, and, or payment of the advance 31-90 days before PCS or 61-180 days
        after arrival at the new PDS.
            6.31.6.1.2.1. The total amount requested must not exceed three month's basic pay
            less deductions.
            6.31.6.1.2.2. Outstanding PCS advances, received based on a previous
            entitlement, are not required to be liquidated when a member requests a new
            advance pay for PCS. The payments the member is making, toward paying off
            that advance, must be considered when determining whether the member can
            afford to get the new advance. In addition, previous installments of the same
            advance pay entitlement must be considered to determine the member’s total
            entitlement to a PCS advance. Example A: Member goes PCS from Denver CO to
            Osan AB Korea, with a 30-day leave enroute. Initially, the member requests a
            one-month advance pay, but during the 30 days of leave, realizes he needs the
            additional 2 months authorized by law. That member’s outstanding advance
            amount must be considered when determining the total advance pay entitlement
            for this PCS. Example B: Member goes PCS from Denver CO to Osan AB Korea,
            requesting a PCS advance of 3 months’ pay on 1 August 2003. On 15 July 2004,
            member prepares to depart Osan AB Korea on a new set of PCS orders and
            requests a PCS advance of 3 months’ pay. The advance this member received on
            1 August does not have to be fully liquidated before payment of the new advance.
            However, the payments this member is making toward the 1 August advance must
            be considered in determining the member’s ability to repay this new advance.
            6.31.6.1.2.3. If expenses include items covered by advances or reimbursements
            for Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA), dislocation allowance, travel and per
            diem allowances, Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), include only that portion
            of the expense that exceeds the other advance or reimbursement. For example, if
            claiming expenses to make overseas housing habitable, include only those
            expenses that exceed allowable advance of OHA/BAH in the total expenses.
            6.31.6.1.2.4. If requesting more than 12 months' payback, justification should
            include a listing of all monthly payments for rent, mortgage, loans, and
            installment payment plans. Payback period may not exceed 24 months or the
            number of months remaining on active duty, whichever is less (the member may
            make additional payments against the advance at any time at the local FSO).
     6.31.6.2. The Commander:
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                 69


          6.31.6.2.1. Must complete Part V - Approval of unit commander or other individual
          on G-Series orders with command responsibility for the member - for all members in
          the rank of E3 and below and in cases listed in paragraph 6.31.6.1.2 and above.
          6.31.6.2.2. May approve an amount equal to or greater than one month's basic pay
          less deductions, but less than the advance requested by the member, a shorter
          repayment schedule, and, or within a more restrictive repayment window as dictated
          by individual circumstances, but may not exceed the limitations in paragraph 6.31.2
          above.
          6.31.6.2.3. Must enter the earliest payment date on the form if prior to PCS or must
          check member's travel settlement voucher if necessary to determine date of arrival at
          new station.
6.32. Advance Payment of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH).
   6.32.1. Conditions of entitlement:
      6.32.1.1. An advance payment of BAH is payable upon request of the member when
      approved by the unit commander or other individual on G-Series orders with command
      responsibility for the member. The advance may be paid to an eligible member to meet
      extraordinary expenses in obtaining or occupying other than government housing.
      Extraordinary expenses include the following:
          6.32.1.1.1. Advance rent.
          6.32.1.1.2. Security deposits.
          6.32.1.1.3. Installation fees. Extraordinary "moving in" expenses should be reflected
          in applicable blocks 4a, 4b, and 4c of AF Form 1039 (Figure 6.10). Block 4d,
          "Other" should not be used.
      6.32.1.2. The purchase of personal property needed to occupy non-government housing
      may be authorized for an advance payment of BAH, but is limited to those items
      necessary for occupancy and must be reasonable in nature. The guide to be used to
      determine the amount of the advance a member may receive for the purchase of personal
      property is in AFI 32-6004, Attachment 8, plus major appliances. Attachment 8 lists the
      furnishings allowances items allowed for CONUS and non-foreign non-CONUS housing.
      6.32.1.3. Additional advance covering housing needs may be approved at any time for
      valid reasons determined by the unit commander or other individual on G-Series orders
      with command responsibility for the member.
      6.32.1.4. The amount of the advance must not exceed the anticipated housing expenses,
      or the total of three months' BAH expected to be accrued by the member, whichever is
      less. When making determinations involving member to member marriage or other
      members sharing arrangements, the combined advance requests, allowances, and
      expenses of the occupants must be considered.
   6.32.2. Disbursement of the Advance:
      6.32.2.1. Member completes AF Form 1039, Request to Receive and/or Extend
      Repayment of an Advance Housing Allowance (Figure 6.10), when requesting an
      advance payment. All housing expense documentation (copies of leases, utility company
 70                                                       AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


       statements, etc.) must accompany AF Form 1039. The request form must be signed by
       the unit commander or other individual on G-Series orders with command responsibility
       for the member who submits the approved AF Form 1039 to the FSO for payment of the
       advance. The advance may be paid at any time during a member's assignment at the PDS.
       A member may receive an advance for dependent housing expenses and also for their
       own housing expenses at an unaccompanied location.
       6.32.2.2. Except in extenuating circumstances (determined by the unit commander or
       other individual on G-Series orders with command responsibility for the member),
       disbursement of the advance normally must not be made more than three workdays
       before the date payment must be made under a lease or rental agreement. For personnel at
       a duty location not having a payment office, the advance may be paid earlier than three
       workdays before lease or rental payment is due because of mail or transportation
       schedules. The disbursement must be made within 30 days after occupancy. This 30-day
       period allows a member sufficient time to move in and determine any extra costs
       associated with the new quarters that were not readily apparent before taking occupancy.
       When circumstances warrant, a waiver of the 30-day period may be approved by the unit
       commander or other individual on G-Series orders with command responsibility for the
       member upon written request from the member. The request must state the reason for the
       delayed advance and show that the funds are needed to meet advance rent, security
       deposits or initial expenses. Approved requests are attached to the payment voucher.
   6.32.3. Repayment of the Advance:
       6.32.3.1. Repayment of the advance is usually required in 12 equal monthly installments,
       but payments must not be less than $50 per month. When justified, and if the approving
       official determines a 12-month repay causes hardship to the member, the repayment may
       be extended beyond 12 months. If a member is on a controlled tour, the repayment period
       may equal the tour length, but may not exceed it. If a member is not serving a controlled
       tour, the repayment period may not exceed 24 months.
       6.32.3.2. In all cases, the repayment period must be completed before the member's
       DOS. When a lease is not completed for which an advance has previously been paid, the
       advance must be repaid in full immediately.
       6.32.3.3. Collection of the advance begins on the first day of the month after payment of
       the advance has been made. When justified by the member and authorized by the unit
       commander or other individual on G-Series orders with command responsibility for the
       member, start of collection action may be postponed (up to three months).
6.33. Officer Assigned TDY Field Duty. When an officer is messing with an organization
under field conditions, meals are not paid for in cash. The meal charges are collected as follows:
   6.33.1. The FSO collects all meal charges for the entire period of field conditions directly
   from the officer's pay after the fact. There is no reimbursement for missed meals while under
   field conditions as all meals are considered available and consumed. The only exception is
   when there is no government mess or rations-in-kind available. Ration-in-kind includes
   prepared meals from a field kitchen, contracted meals, or meals ready to eat (MRE).
   6.33.2. An officer assigned field duty under conditions not covered in subparagraph (1)
   above pays for meals consumed. If the officer did not pay cash for the meals consumed, the
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                    71


   organization furnishing the meals notifies the FSO by DD Form 114 or DD Form 139 for
   meals furnished, period, rate per meal and total amount due.
6.34. Officer Confined. If an officer is confined as a result of a court-martial and not sentenced
to a total forfeiture of pay and allowances and the officer did not pay for meals, then HQ
AFSPA/SPCI Kirtland AFB prepares DD Form 114, reflecting name, SSN, date, and period
meals provided; then processes a DS01 to each members MMPA. This is necessary because the
Army controls the prison at Fort Leaven-worth and does not send billing itemizing individual
meals consumed by name for each prisoner. The Air Force has an Inter-service Support
Agreement (ISA) with the Army to reimburse for the total cost of imprisoning AF members.
Therefore, it is necessary for HQ AFSPA/SPC to charge contract meals for subsistence-in-kind
members to appropriation 57*3500 32*6443 204321 A8 591 5004000 for payment by DFAS-
DE/FJPC.

                                           Chapter 7

                                UNIT LEAVE PROCEDURES

7.1. Responsibilities.
   7.1.1. Commander:
       7.1.1.1. Establishes and controls leave administration within the unit. This should
       include designating a primary and alternate leave monitor in writing. Units must have
       access to current AFI 36-3003 and AFMAN 65-116V2.
       7.1.1.2. Receives monthly leave balance listing from FSO. Uses the leave balance listing
       to control the approval of advance, excess, and terminal leave. The leave balance listing
       may be used to develop and update projected leave schedules. For base using LeaveWeb
       (LW), upload the leave balance listing and notify the orderly room of this action. NOTE:
       The leave balance on the listing is that shown on the member's leave and earning
       statement (LES) plus 2.5 days projected accrual for the current processing month.
       7.1.1.3. Approves advance, excess, and terminal leave. When a request for advance or
       excess leave is submitted, the commander must counsel the individual that periods of
       excess leave are without pay and allowances. Any leave request which results in a
       member having an advance (negative) leave balance over 30 days requires HQ
       AFPC/DPSFC approval. This 30-day negative balance includes the cumulative total of
       previous advance leave, which has been granted (AFI 36-3003). This includes advance
       leave that becomes excess because of early separation. The individual must also be
       advised that there is an additional collection at separation for non-accruals resulting from
       any periods of excess leave. This is one-half day for every six days of excess leave.
       NOTE: Members may carry forward negative leave balances up to negative 30 days
       upon reenlistment or entering extension, provided enough days are accrued based on the
       reenlistment or extension to cover the negative balance.
       7.1.1.4. While commanders have the final authority to approve, disapprove, or extend
       leave, the authority usually is delegated to the lowest supervisory level according to the
       needs of the organization. If delegated, the leave approval authority should be at the level
       where it is easy to check the physical presence or absence of the member during normal
       duty hours. The authority to grant convalescent leave rests with the Unit Commander (or
       acting Unit Commander) and may not be delegated.
   7.1.2. Supervisor Leave Approval Authority:
       7.1.2.1. Verifies leave balance from current LES or unit leave balance listing. Supervisor
       or designee obtains (or has obtained) a leave authorization number from the unit orderly
       room immediately before signing a leave approval and forwarding Part 1 to the FSO.
       Leave authorization numbers may be obtained telephonically or by electronic means.
       NOTE: (If supervisor disapproves leave, there is no need to obtain the leave
       authorization number). Leave approving officials may designate someone other than the
       person requesting leave to obtain the leave authorization number for them. Supervisor
       either approves or disapproves leave and processes requests for supervised members.
       NOTE: Approval for excess, advance, or terminal leave must be made by level of
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                  89


     Commander specified in AFI 36-3003. Member should fold the LES in such a manner
     that the leave-approving official can view only the information pertaining to the
     member's leave balance. Once the leave-approving official has approved the leave, they
     should immediately forward part I to the FSO. Part I is not returned to the member or
     given to the Unit Leave Clerk to submit to the FSO.
     7.1.2.2. If the leave approval authority is at a geographically separated location from the
     member, making it impractical for the supervisor to physically sign the leave form, use
     the following procedures:
        7.1.2.2.1. Member requests the leave telephonically or by electronic means and the
        supervisor sends a message to the member's location indicating leave approval or
        disapproval.
        7.1.2.2.2. The message number is used in lieu of the supervisor's signature block on
        Part I of AF IMT 988 and a copy of the message is attached to Part I of AF IMT 988.
        7.1.2.2.3. For guidance on processing emergency leaves requested under these
        situations, contact HQ AFPC/DPSFC at DSN 665-5204.
     7.1.2.3. Advises the FSO and unit when a member fails to return from leave when
     scheduled.
     7.1.2.4. Provides information to unit to satisfy rejects received when required.
     7.1.2.5. Certifies Part III upon member's return. In consideration of the last day of duty
     before starting leave, and including all other available information, the supervisor
     certifies that the dates of leave are true and correct to the best of their knowledge and
     belief. General officers may certify their own period of leave upon return from leave. The
     date, time, group, (DTG) of the message, or telephone contact used for notification of
     return from leave, should be entered in the Supervisor's Signature block. NOTE: The
     definition of the word "supervisor" for the purposes of certifying part III upon member's
     return, includes the next available person in the member's chain of command having
     knowledge of the facts in cases where it is impractical to obtain actual supervisor's
     signature.
     7.1.2.6. Completing the AF IMT 988, Leave Request/Authorization (Figure 7.1):
        7.1.2.6.1. Blocks 1 through 5, 9, 12 through 21, and 23 through 25 are self-
        explanatory.
        7.1.2.6.2. Block 6. Current Leave Balance. Verify that the member has enough leave
        balance to cover the period of leave requested. Check the member's LES or the
        orderly rooms leave balance listing. Complete 6a when member requests leave with a
        planned return date within 30 days of DOS.
        7.1.2.6.3. Block 7. Recommend Convalescent Leave. This block is completed,
        signed, and stamped by the appropriate medical authority if convalescent leave is
        recommended.
        7.1.2.6.4. Block 8. For permissive temporary duty (PTDY), state the paragraph
        number of the applicable reason for PTDY as stated in AFI 36-3003 and in Remarks
90                                                      AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


        area give abbreviated description of purpose of PTDY. (For example: base baseball
        team.)
        7.1.2.6.5. Block 9. Number Days Requested. Compute the number of days according
        to the guidelines for charging leave appearing at the bottom of Part III. Make sure the
        dates appearing in blocks 12 and 13 correspond to the number of days requested.
        7.1.2.6.6. Block 10. Leave Authorization Number. Supervisor or designee obtains a
        leave authorization number from the unit immediately before approving the leave and
        forwarding Part I to the FSO. Do not obtain the number earlier than 30 days before
        the leave effective date (including terminal leaves).
        7.1.2.6.7. Block 11. First Day/Time of Leave Status. If member departs on leave on a
        non-duty day, enter the non-duty date and 0001 hours. If the member departs on leave
        on a duty day without performing the majority (more than 50 percent) of scheduled
        duty, enter the date and 0001 hours. If the member departs on leave on a duty day
        after performing the majority (more than 50 percent) of scheduled duty, enter the date
        and time released from duty. NOTE: Leave status is not necessarily chargeable leave.
        Member cannot sign up for space-available transportation before the date and time in
        this block. Date cannot be more than one day before the date in block 12.
        7.1.2.6.8. Block 22. For PTDY, use approval level required by AFI 36-3003.
        7.1.2.6.9. Blocks 26-33. These blocks are completed only if leave is advance or
        excess. Since unit commanders only are authorized to approve advance or excess
        leave, block 22 should not be completed except be the unit commander; however,
        member's supervisor/leave approval authority should complete blocks 21, 23, 24, and
        25, along with other blocks according to 1 and 2. Blocks are self-explanatory except
        for block 27 and 28.
            7.1.2.6.9.1. Block 27. Advance Leave. If the requested leave exceeds the current
            balance, but does not exceed the balance to ETS, the leave is advance leave.
            Complete blocks 26 and 27 and forward the form (all parts) to the unit
            commander for approval. If a member requesting leave has a cumulative advance
            balance over 30 days, comply with AFI 36-3003, paragraph 8.
            7.1.2.6.9.2. Block 28. Excess Leave. If the requested leave exceeds the balance to
            expiration term of service (ETS), the leave is excess leave. Complete blocks 26
            through 28, and forward the form (all parts) to the unit commander for approval.
     7.1.2.7. Initially Completing AF IMT 988:
        7.1.2.7.1. Part I. Immediately after first obtaining a leave authorization number
        followed by signing AF IMT 988, separate the form and forward Part 1 to the FSO
        through normal distribution channels unless the leave is terminal or separation or
        involves excess or advance leaves. Forward these leaves (all parts) to the
        Commander for approval. If approved, unit returns Parts II and III to the supervisor,
        except that Part III is retained by the unit for terminal or separation leaves.
        7.1.2.7.2. Part II. Give Part II to the member. Instructions are self-explanatory.
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                   91


        7.1.2.7.3. Part III. Hold Part III for completion after the member's return from leave.
        If member requests cancellation before any leave has been taken, complete section III
        of Part III and forward to the unit.
     7.1.2.8. Completing Part III of AF IMT 988 After Member's Return From Leave. Upon
     member's return from leave, determine how the member's actual leave dates compared to
     the chargeable leave reported to the FSO on Part I. Complete section III and immediately
     forward Part III to the unit on member's first duty day after return from leave. If you
     must alter any section III data after initially completing, line through and initial the
     incorrect data or block. Immediately forward Part III to the unit for prompt processing
     and correction of the member's leave account balance where appropriate.
     7.1.2.9. Leave Date Adjustments and Extensions:
        7.1.2.9.1. If member departs before or after the first day of chargeable leave
        indicated in section I of parts I and III, complete part III, section III, by marking the
        ―should be corrected‖ box in item A and completing items B through E (on AF IMT
        988 in item B line through the word ―last‖ and write in ―first‖. In block 2 of item B
        line through the words ―extended‖ and ―extension‖ and write in the words ―changed‖
        and ―change‖). Sign part III and forward to the unit.
        7.1.2.9.2. For an extension of one or more days, complete Part III, section III, by
        marking the "SHOULD BE CORRECTED" box in item ―A‖ and completing items
        ―B‖ through ―E‖. Sign Part III and forward to the unit."
  7.1.3. Unit: NOTE: in the Air National Guard (ANG), these tasks are performed in the
  comptroller's office for members on active duty under Title 32 U.S.C.):
     7.1.3.1. Establishes and maintains AF Form 1486, Unit Leave Control Log, as in Figure
     7.2
     7.1.3.2. Compares number of days' leave requested against the balance shown on the
     leave balance listing. If advance leave or excess leave is involved, the leave must be
     approved by the commander.
     7.1.3.3. Receives daily register of transactions (DROT) from the FSO daily. When
     requested, the unit provides information to the FSO to satisfy rejected leave transactions.
     7.1.3.4. The unit must make sure all leave authorization numbers released to supervisors
     or leave-approving officials are processed by the FSO. The date the leave request appears
     on the DROT must be posted to the unit leave control log daily. The unit must follow up
     on any leave authorization numbers, which have been released or used, but which do not
     appear on the DROT within six workdays from the date the number was issued. FSOs
     may extend the follow-up period for geographically separated units when warranted by
     local conditions. Additionally, verify that all leave dates, and the number of days leave
     charged match the entries in the unit leave control log. If leave type was recorded on the
     AF Form 1486, also check leave type on the DROT. Resolve any discrepancies with the
     FSO.
     7.1.3.5. AF IMT 988 Procedures:
92                                                      AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


        7.1.3.5.1. Part I. For most leaves, member's supervisor forwards this copy to the FSO
        immediately after first obtaining leave authorization number from the unit and then
        approving leave.
        7.1.3.5.2. Part II. Member's Copy. Section II issued to record data for a leave
        originating outside CONUS and return. Instructions to the member are on the
        member's copy.
        7.1.3.5.3. Part III. For most leaves, supervisor retains Part III until the member
        returns from leave, then completes Section III and forwards to the unit on the
        member's first duty day after return from leave. On receipt of Part III, the unit
        annotates the AF Form 1486 and either retains Part III or forwards it to the FSO for
        additional processing. The (return) manual leave requests which require changes or
        cancellations (hard copy AF IMT 988 Part III) should be process in LW no later than
        one day after receipt and annotated with ―processed via LeaveWeb‖. Forward to the
        FSO for document submission. If member requests change of one or more days leave
        (either at the beginning or end of the leave period), supervisor indicates on AF IMT
        988, part III, section III, that leave should be corrected (refer to paragraph 7.1.2.9.1.
        for more detailed instructions) and forwards to the unit. IMPORTANT: Because
        most leave is charged on a member's anticipated return date, units must immediately
        forward Part III to the FSO, where appropriate, so that the FSO may promptly adjust
        any leave which requires correction. A member may not have more than four leave
        transactions pending at one time due to system constraints.
        7.1.3.5.4. Exception Processing:
            7.1.3.5.4.1. Terminal Leave. All parts are forwarded to the FSO for assignment of
            a leave authorization number, or leave authorization number can be obtained by
            phone or by electronic means. Parts II and III are returned for distribution of Part
            II to the member, and retention of Part III in suspense according to the guidelines
            in paragraph 7.13
            7.1.3.5.4.2. Advance and Excess Leave (Other than Appellate Review Leave).
            All parts are forwarded to the Commander for approval before submission of Part
            I to the FSO. For excess leaves only, handprint Part III in one inch red letters,
            "excess leave". Return Parts II and III to member's supervisor for normal
            completion.
            7.1.3.5.4.3. Appellate Review Leave. All parts are forwarded to the FSO for
            assignment of a leave authorization number, or leave authorization number can be
            obtained by phone or by electronic means. Parts II and III are returned for
            distribution of part II to the member, and retention of Part III in suspense
            according to the guidelines in paragraph 7.11.2.5
     7.1.3.6. AF Form 1486 Procedures. The unit leave clerk maintains this form to issue and
     control leave authorization numbers and to record leave transaction processing from the
     DROT. For terminal leaves and appellate review leaves only, the FSO issues the leave
     authorization number and the FSO alone records processing of the leave on AF Form
     1486, Unit Leave Control Log.
        7.1.3.6.1. Completing AF Form 1486 (Figure 7.2):
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                 93


          7.1.3.6.1.1. Issuing Leave Numbers. Complete the first five blocks from the left
          margin, including the "remarks" block if additional information is needed, that is,
          emergency address, number of day’s leave, type of leave, etc. Under the Part I
          column, enter the "issue date of the authorization number plus six workdays," and
          the projected "return date" (last date of chargeable leave) plus three workdays in
          the appropriate blocks. Leave authorization numbers are not assigned or released
          more than 30 days before the leave effective date. For the purpose of determining
          follow-up dates on AF Form 1486 only, use FSO workdays rather than unit
          workdays if FSO and unit workdays are different.
          7.1.3.6.1.2. Part I Processing (Part I Column). For most leaves, enter the date of
          SB01 processing. If Part I is received by the FSO after the member returns from
          leave, an SB03 may be processed.
          7.1.3.6.1.3. Part III Processing (Part III Column). On receipt of Part III, enter the
          date of Part III receipt on the "Date Part III Received" line. If Part III indicates
          "no change," no further data is entered in this column, and Part III is retained for
          attachment to the completed block assignment package (paragraph 7.1.3.6.2
          describes the block assignment package). If the leave requires "cancellation," or
          "correction," enter either "cancel," or "correct," respectively in the second block,
          and immediately send Part III to the FSO for processing. For all leave area
          "overseas" (OS) or "overseas to CONUS" (OS to CONUS) over 30 days, enter
          "Correct" in Part III column and immediately send Part III to the FSO. For leaves
          requiring correction, post date of SB05 processing. For canceled leaves, post the
          date of SB06 processing. Important: Since leave suspense notices do not appear
          on the DROT, it is critical that unit leave clerks promptly post daily DROT
          transaction data to the AF Form 1486 and follow-up to supervisor and, or FSO for
          late or lost leaves as specified below.
          7.1.3.6.1.4. Follow-up Procedures for Parts I and III:
              7.1.3.6.1.4.1. Part I. Follow-up to member's supervisor and FSO for any Part I
              for which an SB01 does not clear the DROT within six workdays after the
              leave authorization number was issued. This date appears in the first block of
              the Part I column.
              7.1.3.6.1.4.2. Part III. Follow-up to member's supervisor for any Part III that
              is not received (by unit) within three workdays after the member's projected
              return date. Enter this date (return date plus) in the Part I column. For all
              leaves requiring "cancellation," or "correction," follow-up to the FSO if leave
              transaction, as appropriate, has not cleared the DROT within six workdays
              after transmittal (date Part III received) of Part III to the FSO.
       7.1.3.6.2. Leave Block Closure. After Parts I and III for a given block have cleared
       the DROT as applicable, attach retained Parts III to the AF Forms 1486 and submit
       the completed block assignment package to the command section for closure or
       review of the leave block assignment (reference paragraph 7.1.3.7.2). The unit
       commander or designated representative must verify Block assignments against the
       DROT at least once every 45 days, whether the block assignment has been completed
       or not. If this is not done, it is likely some of the DROTs needed for verification will
94                                                      AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


        be unavailable as Air Force Records Disposition Schedule requires that DROTs
        maintained at the unit input source are to be destroyed after two months. After the
        unit commander or representative inspects the package, if the block assignment
        package is not ready for closure, return to the unit leave clerk. If the unit commander
        or representative has certified closure of the leave block on AF Form 1134, destroy
        all Parts III and retain the AF Form 1486 according to Air Force Records Disposition
        Schedule.
     7.1.3.7. AF Form 1134, Unit Leave Authorization Numbers-Block Assignments, (Figure
     7.3) Procedures: The unit commander or designated representative (may not be the unit
     leave clerk) maintains this form for all non LeaveWeb leave requests. It is used to assign
     blocks of leave authorization numbers to unit leave clerks and to certify closure of the
     blocks (block assignment package) after all leave numbers in the block have been
     processed by the FSO. The block assignment package consists of completed AF Forms
     1486, and Parts III, AF Forms 988 retained for examination.
        7.1.3.7.1. Block Assignment:
            7.1.3.7.1.1. To assign a block, enter: Date issued, block assigned (for example,
            DE 00100 to 00199), authorized in block (for example, 100) and name and rank
            of unit leave clerk assigned. Obtain clerk's signature.
            7.1.3.7.1.2. Additional blocks are assigned when needed, whether or not any or
            all preceding blocks have been closed. Infrequent issuance of block numbers may
            indicate the need to issue smaller blocks, thereby allowing more frequent
            examination of unit leave records for improved leave control and administration.
            It is within the unit commander's discretion to establish the block size of leave
            authorizations issuable for any unit. It is recommended, however, that block
            assignments be of manageable size and for not more than a month of use.
        7.1.3.7.2. Block Closure. To close a block, enter the date closed, and sign the
        commander's (or designate) signature block. Before closing the block, follow
        paragraphs 1 and 2 procedures in examining AF Forms 988 and 1486, and the DROT
        of the block assignment package.
            7.1.3.7.2.1. AF Form 1486:
                7.1.3.7.2.1.1. Part I Column. For each leave number assigned, verify that
                dates appear in appropriate blocks of the Part I column. An "issue date+6" and
                "return date+3" should appear for all leave number assignments in blocks 1
                and 3 (lines 1 and 3) respectively. An SB01 or SB03 should appear in the
                second block.
                7.1.3.7.2.1.2. Part III Column. For all leave entries, a date must appear in the
                first block for each leave number assignment. For each leave number where
                "cancel" is entered in the second block, verify that an SB06 date appears in the
                third block. For each leave number where "correct" is entered in the second
                block, verify that an SB05 date appears in the third block.
                7.1.3.7.2.1.3. DROT Transaction Processing. Select a sample of the leave
                entries from the AF Form 1486 and referring to copies of the DROT, verify all
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                     95


                 dates of SB01, SB03, SB05, and SB06 processing, as appropriate. Also, check
                 that other leave information (leave dates, type of leave if recorded on the AF
                 Form 1486, and number of days leave charged) match the entries in the unit
                 leave control log, (until you become familiar with the DROT, you may want
                 your leave clerk to assist you in verifying transaction processing on the
                 DROT).
              7.1.3.7.2.2. AF IMT 988-Part III. For Parts III retained as part of the completed
              block package, randomly verify member and supervisor signatures in Section III,
              and that the "no change" block only is checked in Section III. Select a sample of
              these Parts III and referring to the proper leave entries on AF Form 1486, verify
              that leave chargeable dates are identical. The completed block package should
              not include any Parts III indicating "should be corrected" or "should be canceled."
          7.1.3.7.3. Corrective Action. Whenever a potential discrepancy is identified, discuss
          the matter with your responsible leave clerk, and make sure corrective action, if
          appropriate, is taken. For example, additional transaction processing may be
          necessary, or further completion of columns I and III, AF Form 1486.
      7.1.3.8. Unit Leave Administration - Compliance. With elimination of leave suspense
      listings and increased unit responsibility for controlling leave processing, it is absolutely
      essential that unit commanders vigorously emphasize compliance with established leave
      procedures.
7.2. Procedures for Use of AF IMT 988, Leave Request/Authorization.
   7.2.1. AF IMT 988. AF IMT 988 is shown in figure 7.1. All leave documents must be
   typewritten or written in ink. All entries must be legible. The member (or administrative
   personnel) prepares the form as shown in figure 7.1, and submits it to the supervisor/leave
   approving official for approval. The form must be submitted to unit commander through
   supervisor for advance, excess, or terminal leave. Distribute an approved request as follows:
      7.2.1.1. Part I - FSO copy. Supervisor/leave approving official submits this copy
      directly to the FSO, normally using base distribution system, immediately after first
      obtaining leave authorization number and then approving leave. Part I is not returned to
      the member or given to the unit leave clerk to submit to the FSO.
      7.2.1.2. Part II - Member's copy.
      7.2.1.3. Part III - Unit copy. Supervisor/leave approving official retains until member
      returns from leave, then submits this copy directly to the unit, normally using base
      distribution system, within one workday.
   7.2.2. Excess Leave. Supervisor identifies leave requested as excess leave, completes the
   appropriate blocks on Part I using member's current LES, and forwards to commander for
   approval. For members taking excess leave between court-martial sentencing and approval,
   or during appellate review, the unit commander must overstamp Part II in red "Not
   authorized space-available transportation on DoD-owned or controlled aircraft."
   7.2.3. Overseas to Overseas or Overseas to CONUS Leave Data. Member completes items
   on bottom of Part II to record data for leave taken from overseas to CONUS and return.
 96                                                     AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


      7.2.3.1. Date and Time Depart PDS - Enter date and time of departure from unit of
      assignment.
      7.2.3.2. Date and Time Return PDS - Enter date and time of return to unit of assignment.
      7.2.3.3. Date Depart DESG Pay Area - Enter date of departure from an area designated
      for payment of foreign duty pay or hostile fire pay.
      7.2.3.4. Date Arrive CONUS - Enter date of arrival in CONUS, if applicable.
      7.2.3.5. Date Depart CONUS - Enter date of departure from CONUS, if applicable.
      7.2.3.6. Date Return DESG Pay Area - Enter day of return to an area designated for
      payment of foreign duty pay or hostile fire pay. NOTE: Enter on member's copy as they
      occur to ensure accurate leave charges and applicable charges to pay and allowances.
      Copy the information on Part III after member returns from leave.
7.3. Document Controls and Numbering.
   7.3.1. Document Control Files. Each supervisor maintains a suspense file of Part III of the
   AF IMT 988. Screen this file daily to make sure members' return to duty upon expiration of
   their leave.
   7.3.2. Leave Numbering, Except Terminal Leave and Appellate Review Leave. The unit
   controls the issuance of leave authorization numbers. They are issued sequentially and are
   recorded on AF Form 1486, Unit Leave Control Log (Figure 7.2). At the end of a fiscal year
   the local FSO determines if the units begin a new series of leave authorization numbers for
   leaves approved on or after 1 October, or continue on with the current series of numbers.
   NOTE: When 99,999 is reached, a new series must be started.
   7.3.3. Leave Numbering for Terminal Leave and Appellate Review Leave. The FSO assigns
   leave authorization number after verifying the number of days. Terminal leave requested
   will not exceed member's leave balance through date of separation. FSO need not receive
   AF Form 988 to assign a leave authorization number; it may be obtained over the telephone
   or by electronic means. Leave authorization numbers are not assigned or released more than
   30 days before the leave effective date.
7.4. Request for Leave.
   7.4.1. Leave Request on AF IMT 988:
      7.4.1.1. Leave requests granted on AF IMT 988 are ordinary, emergency, reenlistment,
      sick and convalescent, terminal, leave awaiting appellate review, special, graduation, and
      most permissive TDY. Leaves taken during permissive or official TDY where member
      returns to the TDY station are also entered on an AF IMT 988 (AFI 65-114). The
      member prepares the leave request in three parts and submits it to the supervisor for
      approval. The supervisor ascertains leave balance. If member has enough leave balance
      to cover period of requested leave, supervisor first obtains number from unit, then
      approves leave, and forwards Part I to the FSO immediately. If requested leave is
      terminal leave, or causes the member to be in an advance or excess leave status, advises
      member, completes Section II, and forwards entire leave request to commander for
      approval. After recommending approval of an advance or excess leave request, the
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                     97


      supervisor may permit a member to hand-carry leave request to unit for commander's
      approval or disapproval.
      7.4.1.2. For terminal, advance, and excess leave, the commander verifies member's
      expiration of term of service (ETS, if enlisted) or date of separation (DOS) (officer, if
      established) and approves or disapproves the leave request. This is done by court-martial
      convening authority for leave awaiting appellate review. If leave is disapproved, the unit
      returns the request through the supervisor to the member with an explanation. If
      Commander approves excess leave, commander must advise the member that any leave
      charges as a result of this leave results in immediate collection of all pay and allowances.
      Part III of the approved request is returned to the supervisor for other than terminal leave.
      Distribute AF IMT 988 per paragraph 7.1.3.5.4.
   7.4.2. Delay En Route. Before departure, the approving official advises the member that any
   leave charged as a result of PCS or TDY travel in excess of that accrued before the member's
   expiration of term of service (ETS) results in immediate collection of all pay and allowances
   for the excess period.
7.5. Commencement of Leave.
   7.5.1. Member. Leave status begins on the effective date as shown on the approved leave
   request. If there is a change to the leave start date, it will be processed as a correction from
   part III upon the member’s return from leave. NOTE: Member does not have to depart on
   the time of leave status in order for the AF IMT 988 to be valid, but must have been eligible
   to depart at that time. If member starts leave or signs up for space-available travel and
   performs more than 50 percent of scheduled duty, that day is considered a day of duty. If the
   member starts leave or signs up for space-available travel and does not perform more than 50
   percent of scheduled duty or that day is a non-duty day, the member is on leave. See AFI 36-
   3003, Table 1.
   7.5.2. Supervisor. When member departs on effective date of leave, process leave in the
   normal manner. If there is a change to the leave start date, process as a correction from part
   III upon the member’s return.
7.6. Termination of Leave.
   7.6.1. On or Before Schedule. Charge the day of return as leave unless the member
   performed all or the majority (more than 50 percent) of their scheduled duties or the member
   returns on a non-duty day. In such event, consider the day a day of duty. See AFI 36-3003,
   Table 1. The leave-approving authority is the final authority for such determinations because
   no single rule can apply to the many duty situations that exist throughout the Air Force.
   When the leave-approving authority credits a member for having worked a duty day, do not
   charge leave for such day. Enter last day of leave in block 12 of AF IMT 988. The member
   and the supervisor complete Part III and forward to the unit within one workday. When
   member returns from leave on schedule, on Part III, Section III, mark item A in the "No
   Change" box and complete items C through E only. When member returns from leave before
   schedule, mark item A in the "Should be Corrected" box and complete items B through E.
   General officers certify their own period of leave. Enter the DTG of the message, or
   telephone contact or contact by electronic means, used for notification of return from leave in
   the Supervisor's Signature block.
 98                                                        AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


   7.6.2. Beyond Schedule. If the member returns from leave beyond scheduled date of return
   because of transportation or weather difficulties, etc., and the delay is authorized, process as
   normal extension (paragraph 7.8). If the delay is not excused by the commander or the leave-
   approving authority and failure to report by 2400 hours the day after the last day of leave is
   unauthorized absence. In this case, the day due to report is computed as the first day of
   absence without leave. (AFI 36-2911.)
7.7. Failure to Return from Leave.
   7.7.1. Leave Return File Check. The supervisor is required to check suspensed copies daily
   and, upon receipt of inquiries from the FSO or unit, to determine if member failed to return
   from leave. If the member has no extension, the supervisor notifies the unit commander that
   the member has failed to return on the projected date of return.
   7.7.2. Duty Status Change. For those members who fail to return from leave as scheduled,
   the unit commander must comply with AFI 36-2911. Use AF Form 2098, Duty Status
   Change, and place the member in new status (AFMAN 36-2622, volume I, Chapter 3).
   When member's status changes from leave to AWOL, hospital, etc., the supervisor completes
   the leave request, Part III, with the day before the new status date as the return date and sends
   to unit. Unit forwards AF Form 2098 to personnel, and AF IMT 988 to FSO for processing.
7.8. Extension of Leave. (Table 7.1, rules 5 and 10):
   7.8.1. Member. Makes request to the unit commander or supervisor. If request is made by
   telephone or telegram or electronic means, obtain the member's signature on return from
   leave.
   7.8.2. Unit. The unit commander or supervisor approves or disapproves the request and
   notifies the member accordingly. If unit approves, the unit notifies the supervisor; if
   supervisor approves, the unit is notified. In either case, the extension is processed as a
   correction from Part III upon member's return from leave.
7.9. Corrections. Unit or supervisor notifies the FSO in writing of any required corrections
after processing of leave period. Corrections made to the leave dates in the certification require
the supervisor's initials. Any correction on the leave document must be legible. Illegible
documents are returned to the leave approving official for re-accomplishment.
7.10. Cancellation. The supervisor informs unit that leave is canceled. Supervisor checks
"should be canceled" block on Part III of AF IMT 988, types or prints name and grade in
appropriate block, signs in Signature block, and forwards to the unit. The unit annotates leave
log "canceled" when supervisor informs that such is the case. When SBO6 transaction appears
on DROT, unit posts DROT date to unit control log. If an SBO6 transaction appears on the
DROT but supervisor has not previously informed unit of cancellation, unit must verify
cancellation with supervisor. The FSO randomly checks leave cancellations with unit logs to
make sure logs are properly annotated. If leave is canceled before Part I is sent to FSO,
supervisor submits Part III to unit with the statement "Leave request canceled before submission
of Part I to FSO."
7.11. Processing Other than Ordinary Leave.
   7.11.1. Excess Leave:
       7.11.1.1. Member With ETS. Leave is automatically charged:
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                 99


         7.11.1.1.1. Against accrued leave, then,
         7.11.1.1.2. Against advance leave that may be earned before ETS, and finally;
         7.11.1.1.3. All remaining as excess leave.
     7.11.1.2. Member Without ETS. Leave granted as excess is designated by the
     commander and is stated on AF IMT 988. Advance leave is granted only in amounts,
     which can reasonably be expected to be accrued by member. Leave taken over and above
     that which can be accrued is categorized as excess leave.
     7.11.1.3. DFAS Actions. DFAS calculates excess leave and shows on AF Form 141,
     Leave and Earnings Statement, the effects on pay and allowances and leave balances.
     7.11.1.4. Process extended excess leaves as shown in AFI 36-3003, as Ordinary (type A)
     leaves. If the leave is to be for an indefinite period, the leave should be set up for 300
     days.
  7.11.2. Non-Routine Processing. Leave types requiring non-routine processing are:
     7.11.2.1. Sick or Convalescent Leave. May be granted upon the written recommendation
     of or by proper medical authority. (Table 7.4) The approval authority for convalescent
     leave is the unit commander (or acting unit commander) and may not be delegated.
     7.11.2.2. Emergency Leave. May be requested by a member, a relative, or persons
     acting in behalf of the family. Procedures for members taking funded emergency leave
     using AF Form 972, Request and Authorization for Emergency Leave Travel, are in
     AFMAN 65-114. All other emergency leaves are processed as outlined in table 7-5.
     7.11.2.3. Leave During Travel. When a member who is on TDY departs on leave and
     returns to the TDY point, the unit at the TDY point initiates and sends input to the
     reporting agency at the TDY point. If the member on TDY departs on leave and does not
     return to the TDY point, the Travel SMA (FSO) at member's permanent duty station
     (PDS) extracts the leave charge from the travel voucher covering all travel from old
     permanent station to new permanent station, including any leave periods and TDY travel
     performed from any TDY points. When member performs TDY and is not assigned to a
     TDY unit, member submits leave request to the unit of assignment (request may be by
     telephone or electronic means). In such cases, the unit of assignment prepares AF IMT
     988. Annotate in Member's Signature block of the AF IMT 988 "Member TDY per
     SO___." Member attaches Part II of any AF Forms 988 issued during TDY to the travel
     voucher (partial or settlement). FSO returns Part II to member after computation and
     payment of the travel voucher.
     7.11.2.4. Reenlistment Leave. Process reenlistment leave the same as ordinary leave.
     When reenlistment leave is deferred, prepare an AF IMT 988, annotate on the form
     "Reenl Lv days deferred until (Date)," have commander or supervisor certify, and file in
     suspense at the unit. NOTE: Unit forwards approved leave request to supervisor before
     effective date.
     7.11.2.5. Appellate Review Leave. A member who has been adjudged a punitive
     discharge whose sentence did not include confinement, or who has served the
     confinement, or has had the confinement deferred and is awaiting completion of the
     appellate review process, may be directed to be placed on appellate review leave. (When
 100                                                      AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


       excess leave has been directed for a member in an overseas area who has been convicted
       by court martial, refer to AFI 36-3003). The unit prepares AF IMT 988 for appellate
       review leave showing a period of leave of 300 days. (The leave authorization number is
       obtained from the FSO and these leaves are recorded on the AF Form 1486 maintained
       by the FSO.) Upon signature of the Unit commander, Part I is sent to the FSO for
       processing, Part II is given to the member and Part III held by the leave approval
       authority until completion of the appellate review leave. Upon completion of the leave,
       Part III is sent to the FSO to return the member to duty. If the appellate review leave has
       been approved by the overseas commander, the overseas FSO must process the appellate
       review leave. If, at the end of the original appellate review leave period, the member is
       still on appellate review leave and is no longer assigned to the overseas FSO, the overseas
       FSO must contact the stateside FSO to which the member has been assigned. The
       stateside FSO provides the appellate review leave number for the next period of appellate
       review leave and the overseas FSO processes that leave. From that point on, the
       appellate review leave for the member is processed by the servicing stateside FSO.
       7.11.2.6. Leave Awaiting Space Available (Space-A) Transportation. When members
       register for Space-A transportation at a AMC terminal, Part II of AF IMT 988 is stamped
       with the date and time of registration. In certifying leave taken, supervisors must check
       part II (member's copy) to make sure all periods awaiting Space-A transportation
       (regardless of whether member obtains transportation or not) are accurately reflected on
       part III of AF IMT 988. The member must certify on section III, Part III, whether or not
       space-available transportation was used, and date of sign-up, if applicable.
       7.11.2.7. Special Leave. A non-chargeable increment of Special Rest and Recuperation
       leave (and transportation, if applicable), is authorized to enlisted members in certain
       specialties who voluntarily extend their overseas tours (10 U.S.C. 705, 23 Dec 1980).
       This leave is authorized in lieu of $80 per month special pay for extensions in these
       specialties. (AFI 36-3003, for eligibility criteria and administrative instructions.)
       7.11.2.8. Educational Leave of Absence. (Type 1) a non-chargeable leave type which is
       for an authorized leave of absence for a period not to exceed two years for the purpose of
       permitting the member to pursue a program of education. (See AFI 36-3003, for
       eligibility criteria and administrative instructions.)
       7.11.2.9. Recruiter Assistance Program (RAP). (Type Y) This program authorizes certain
       technical training hometown non-prior service and OTS graduates up to 12 days of non-
       chargeable leave to assist hometown non-prior service and OTS recruiters. (See AFI 36-
       3003, for eligibility criteria and administrative instructions.)
7.12. Special Leave Accrual. Members normally lose leave accumulated in excess of 75 days
at fiscal year end. That limit was previously 60 days and, without legislative extension, it goes
back to 60 days on 1 October 2013. Some members, however, may be eligible, under certain
circumstances, to carry more than 75 days leave forward from one fiscal year to the next.
   7.12.1. Leave Entitlement for Service in a Hostile Fire Pay Area. Member who serves 120
   consecutive days or more in a hostile fire pay area is entitled to carry forward up to 120 days'
   leave earned at the beginning of a new fiscal year (FY) or at separation with immediate
   reenlistment. DJMS-AC calculates this entitlement from input of a PCS arrival and departure
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                     101


   or the start and stop of a hostile fire pay entitlement for a TDY period of 120 days or more.
   No separate input is required for the leave entitlement.
   7.12.2. Leave Entitlement for Service in Support of Contingency Operations. Members
   who lost leave due to support for contingency operations may be eligible to carry forward
   leave in excess of 75 days, not to exceed 90 days, at the end of the fiscal year. even though
   they did not deploy to a hostile fire/imminent danger pay area, Leave carried forward under
   this paragraph is lost unless used before the end of the second fiscal year after the fiscal year
   in which such service on active duty is terminated. In order to carry up to 90 days forward,
   separate approval must be granted under Special Leave Accrual procedures. See AFI 36-
   3003, Section E for additional information.
7.13. Terminal Leave. Commander may approve terminal leave for member who makes
request. Compute member's leave balance through last day of active duty by using the last LES
or, if LES is unavailable, request the FSO to send leave balance inquiry to DFAS. Leave is taken
in full days; half-day balances must be rounded down to a full day, and remainder is included in
member's final separation pay, unless the member has already sold 60 days leave, in which case
any remaining leave days are lost. Also, deduct the number of days' leave taken that are not
shown on the LES or inquiry. Unit retains Part III in suspense until either:
   7.13.1. Member's leave terminates because of hospitalization, death, etc., or;
   7.13.2. 10 days after last day of leave. If member returns from leave, unit commander
   completes Part III and sends to FSO. If, by 10 days after scheduled leave completion, unit
   has not received notice that member returned to duty, unit processes Part III in accordance
   with Air Force Records Disposition Schedule. This is an example using the October LES for
   computation when member is retiring 1 January:
       LES            BF             EARN            USED           BAL

       38.0                          5                 5            35.5

       Compute earned for November and December 5.0
       Balance as of 31 December        40.5
       Maximum leave to be taken 40.0
   7.13.3. Member Assigned to CONUS Base. Prepare AF IMT 988 and process.
   7.13.4. Member Overseas. If reassigned to CONUS base for retirement processing, prepare
   AF IMT 988, leaving blocks 10, 17, 18, 19, and 20 blank. Unit commander indicates
   approval by signing in Supervisor's Signature block. Send all copies to MPS for inclusion in
   member's records for transmittal to CONUS processing base. CONUS processing unit
   completes AF IMT 988 and forwards it to the local FSO for processing.
   7.13.5. Member Assigned Overseas with Separation at Overseas Location. Members
   stationed overseas immediately prior to separation separate overseas unless not co-located
   with finance and personnel offices (see paragraph 7.13.4 above). Leave numbers for a
   stand-alone PTDY will be assigned by the FSS. Leave numbers for terminal PTDY (no
   terminal leave taken) should be assigned by the FSO. Effective date of the PTDY/terminal
   leave is the day after the member's port call.
 102                                                      AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


       7.13.5.1. DELETED.
       7.13.5.2. DELETED.
7.14. Leave Within 30 Days of Separation or Retirement with Return to PDS Before ETS,
or Delay En Route Incident to PCS for Separation. When approving such leave, leave
approving authority must:
   7.14.1. Advise member departing on leave, or departing PCS with delay en route, to
   schedule the return from such leave no later than the 15th day before DOS, if possible.
   7.14.2. Advise member to use the exact number of days' leave granted, if possible.
   7.14.3. Advise member that failure to comply with ―7.14.1‖ and ―7.14.2‖ above may result
   in an adjustment and possible delay of final settlement of pay and allowances.
   7.14.4. Include in the reassignment orders delay en route granted to members who are
   reassigned to CONUS bases and ports for separation processing.
   7.14.5. Enter statement at top of AF IMT 988, "Member separating (date)."
7.15. Permissive TDY (PTDY). Most PTDY may be processed using AF IMT 988 (AFI 36-
3003). The only exceptions are:
   7.15.1. Educational Leave of Absence Program (formerly called Bootstrap),
   7.15.2. Morale, Welfare, and Recreation activities where the member is eligible for space-
   required air transportation and, or reimbursable expenses are involved, and
   7.15.3. All PTDY taken in conjunction with TDY or PCS (en route). For these exceptions,
   official orders are prepared in accordance with AFI 65-103 for TDY and AFI 36-2102 for
   PCS.
   7.15.4. Disposition. Immediately after obtaining leave authorization numbers unit
   commander (or designee) approves PTDY (and leave, if applicable) and immediately
   forwards part I to the FSO. Part II is given to the member. Part III is retained by the
   approving official for completion upon the member's return. Forms that contain overlapping
   dates or are improperly completed are returned to the approving official for correction.
   7.15.5. If leave is to be taken in conjunction with PTDY, a separate AF IMT 988 must be
   prepared for approval by the leave approving official. If leave is taken immediately prior to
   PTDY, enter the date and time the member is authorized to depart on leave in block 10 of the
   AF IMT 988 used for leave. The last day of chargeable leave (block 12) is the day prior to
   the day that PTDY begins (including travel time). If leave is taken immediately after PTDY,
   enter the date leave begins and 0001 hours in block 10. Once the member has ended the first
   period of leave or PTDY, Part III for the first AF IMT 988 may be completed and sent to the
   unit. If it is impractical or impossible to obtain the members signature at that time, annotate
   the circumstances and forward to the unit. If it is doubtful that member completed the first
   leave or PTDY as projected, the Part III for that AF IMT 988 may be held by the supervisor
   and completed upon member's return.
   7.15.6. Return of member. See paragraph 7.6 for termination on or before schedule. See
   paragraph 7.8 for extensions.
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                                103


   7.15.7. Instructions. Instructions for completing AF IMT 988 for PTDY are in figure 7-4. If
   PTDY is for traveling to vicinity of new PDS, review AFI 36-3003, table 5, rule 1, for
   approval authority.
   7.15.8. Extensions. See AFI 36-3003 for approval authority for extensions of PTDY.
   7.15.9. Terminal PTDY. PTDY is defined as PTDY granted in conjunction with separation
   or retirement where member will be in a PTDY status on the last day of active duty or when
   the member takes PTDY in conjunction with terminal leave. Terminal PTDY will be handled
   in the same manner as terminal leave. That is, the leave authorization number for Terminal
   PTDY will be issued by the FSO and may be recorded on the same leave control log as
   terminal leaves. NOTE: All other PTDYs (those which are not terminal) will have leave
   authorization numbers issued by the unit. Only members separating under the TAMPS
   program may take PTDY in conjunction with terminal leave.
7.16. LeaveWeb.
   7.16.1. Leave requests, document control and numbering. Manual leave processing vs
   LeaveWeb (LW) processing. Prior to 2002 all leaves were requested and accounted for on
   paper copies of AF Form 988. With the advent of LW in 2002 the majority of leaves are now
   requested, approved, and processed electronically via the LW. Finance trains the unit leave
   monitor (ULM) and alternates on their roles and responsibilities in managing the leave
   program and on the use of leave web prior to issuing the unit administration access. This
   includes briefing the ULM to inform the FSO when they leave the unit or are no longer
   assigned as the ULM or alternate. AF Form 1134, unit leave authorization numbers-block
   assignments, (figure 7.3) is used for leave requests other than LeaveWeb. Unit leave
   monitors will use a memorandum similar to figure 7.9 to certify that all leaves were closed,
   validated and reconciled for the period indicated as well as the exceptions. This will be
   accomplished every 30 days covering the previous 45 days of leave input.
   7.16.2. LeaveWeb procedures for members, approving officials and orderly rooms.
      7.16.2.1. Member LeaveWeb Procedures for Ordinary Leave: for most leave requests
      members request leave in LW much the same way as requesting leave using manual
      procedures. The exception to this is processing leaves which require coordination or
      approval from other than the member’s supervisor. Figures 7.5 through 7.8 provide
      detailed guidance on the utilization of the LW system.
          7.16.2.1.1. Member’s guide for requesting ordinary leave through LW. (Figure 7.5)
          7.16.2.1.2. Members’ guide for return from ordinary leave through LW. (Figure 7.6)
          7.16.2.1.3. Supervisor’s procedures when using LW. (Figure 7.7)
          7.16.2.1.4. LeaveWeb unit admin procedures. (Figure 7.8)
      7.16.2.2. Other than Ordinary Leave Procedures: For other than ordinary leaves or if the
      member is unable to access the LW system, the member prepares and coordinates an AF
      IMT 988 according to the procedures listed in paragraph 7.11. The member forwards the
      documentation to the orderly room for processing by the ULM after approval by the
      appropriate commander. Input leave requests no later than one day prior to the start date
      of leave if possible. Upon return, the member coordinates with the supervisor and
      orderly room to certify the return from leave.
104                                                      AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


      7.16.2.3. Bases using LeaveWeb: The ULM should access LW daily to validate leave
      request submitted by the members and approved by an authorized official. The leave
      request should be reviewed to ensure that the leave request contains appropriate
      emergency contact information. Review comments provided in the appropriate block if
      leaves are rejected to the member and approving official.
  7.16.3. Other key duties:
      7.16.3.1. Unit admin has capability to input other than ordinary type leaves (i.e.
      convalescent, permissive). Members will bring the forms to you for this type of leave.
      Enter them into system under new manual request. (They will flow through system as
      normal leave from that point on.) Annotate the date input into LW at the top of the form
      and forward the hard copy AF IMT 988 to finance for their records.
      7.16.3.2. Leave balance listing.
         7.16.3.2.1. At the end of each month print the leave balance listing for your unit(s).
         Review this list for any personnel either missing from this list or on the list but they
         are not assigned to your unit(s). Identify any required changes electronically or in
         writing to finance as soon as possible for the changes to be made.
      7.16.3.3. Member maintenance.
         7.16.3.3.1. Member information required to update LeaveWeb. Correct e-mail
         address. Duty phone. Duty section.
      7.16.3.4. Unit leave log.
         7.16.3.4.1. Print AF Form 1486 every 30 days, from LeaveWeb, that consists of 45
         days of leave input. Unit commanders are required to verify and sign that leaves are
         closed and corrections, cancellations (if applicable) are annotated on the AF Form
         1486. ULM should review the AF Form 1486 weekly in LW to ensure that all
         transactions have been reconciled. Documented follow up conducted with the FSO
         determines the status of unreconciled or unprocessed leaves no later than 6 workdays
         after the transactions were validated by the ULM.
         7.16.3.4.2. Make certain that all leaves have processed and closed; follow-up with
         finance for any outstanding transactions. Follow-up on open leaves in R0 and R1
         status must be accomplished with the member and/or supervisor by the UA.
         7.16.3.4.3. There are no leave blocks or DRPTS to pick up from finance.
         7.16.3.4.4. Everything is handled by computer.
  7.16.4. Status of Leave: Q0 - leave has been entered by member but not submitted. Q1 -
  leave submitted by member but not yet approved by approving official. Q2 - leave approved
  awaiting validation from unit admin. Q9 - leave canceled before validation. R0 - member on
  leave; awaiting submission of part 3. R1 - member completes part 3 and is awaiting
  supervisor’s approval. R2 - return from leave has-been approved awaiting validation from
  unit admin. R4 - leave closed. R9 - leave canceled after it was validated.
  7.16.5. Key features:
      7.16.5.1. Computerized tracking of leave log and AF Form 1486.
AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007                                                              105


     7.16.5.2. Automatic assignment of leave numbers.
     7.16.5.3. Automatic follow-up of part III.
     7.16.5.4. An electronic leave balance listing.
     7.16.5.5. Ability to query a members leave history (note that only leaves taken through
     LeaveWeb can be queried). Commanders should be made aware of the capability to run a
     report of bridging leaves from LeaveWeb and this report should be run periodically to
     validate adherence to current leave guidance.
     7.16.5.6. Leave Projection Lists.
  7.16.6. Troubleshooting:
     7.16.6.1. A member is not getting e-mail with their new password. Check e-mail address
     under member maintenance. Does it match global address in outlook? If not change it.
     Manually change address if member does not have e-mail.
     7.16.6.2. System will not let member take leave.
         7.16.6.2.1. Ask if the member just put in for an extension. Contact finance and
         request member's DOS to be adjusted in system to allow member to take leave. Ask
         if the member is within 30 days of separation or retirement. If so, contact the
         separations clerk at finance for guidance. If the member is requesting separations,
         permissive TDY or terminal leave, have the member complete AF IMT 988 and route
         to finance for input into the system and assign a leave number.
     7.16.6.3. Unit admin cannot login.
         7.16.6.3.1. Check web address. Are you trying to enter through the member’s page?
         Are you using the right login? Admin use last name. When you take leave you enter
         through the member page with SSN#.
     7.16.6.4. Server crashes.
         7.16.6.4.1. Have members complete manual leave forms. Contact finance for get well
         info. Hold manual leave forms until system comes online and manually input leaves.
         Finance will advise to bring leaves in for processing if system will be down for
         extensive period of time.
     7.16.6.5. New members to unit.
         7.16.6.5.1. Send e-mail with members name and SSN# to finance to add them into
         the system.
     7.16.6.6. Member PCA's or PCS's.
         7.16.6.6.1. PCA.
            7.16.6.6.1.1. If member is moving to a unit you control just change unit ID under
            member maintenance. If member is moving to a unit you do not control, follow
            new members to unit instructions.
         7.16.6.6.2. PCS.
            7.16.6.6.2.1. If members PCS out of unit, they will remain on your books for 60
106                                                    AFMAN65-116V2 16 MARCH 2007


             days, after which time they will disappear from your books.
  7.16.7. Additional notes:
      7.16.7.1. Finance will work with you on any problems you are having with LeaveWeb.
      7.16.7.2. You may contact the LeaveWeb helpdesk at DSN 229-2282 or by email at:
      leave@scott.af.mil (Put LeaveWeb assistance in the subject line.)
      7.16.7.3. You will be notified via e-mail as new features and innovations become
      available.
