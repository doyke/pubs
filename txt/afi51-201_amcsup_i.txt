ferral of Charges, contains additional memoranda to include a sample probable cause determination

Reporters, and Convening Courts-Martial, has been updated to reflect the changes to the judiciary. The
chapter also includes a new provision regarding the appointment of defense investigative support. Chap-
ter 6, Travel Funding, Witness Production, and Immunity is substantially expanded including specific
guidance in addition to the discussion of subpoenas i.e. to the media. Chapter 7, Victim and Witness
Assistance, now combines the sections regarding services provided to victims and witnesses and also ref-
erences the authority for the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program. Chapter 8, Trial Mat-
ters, addresses Resignations for the Good of the Service (RILOs) in Section 8F and prohibits
submissions post-arraignment. Chapter 9, Post-Trial Procedure is renamed and the sections rearranged
with additional attachments i.e. figures. Chapter 10, is entitled Court-Martial Orders. Chapter 11, is
entitled Appeals and Reviews, Rehearings, Retrials, DuBay Hearings and Clemency. Chapter 12

(AMC) This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: Paragraphs have been renumbered to reflect the current provisions of AFI 51-201. It removes the
separate Special Interest Reporting requirement for unprofessional relationships between officer and
senior enlisted personnel from paragraph 13.8.2., as AFI 51-201 already requires reporting of fraterniza-
tion and unprofessional relationship cases.

                                                  Chapter 1

             PURPOSE, COMMAND INFLUENCE, AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

1.1. Purpose. This instruction sets forth requirements for the administration of military justice. The pri-
mary sources of rules and guidance on military justice are in the Uniform Code of Military Justice
(UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. §801 et. seq., and the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM).
1.1. (AMC) Purpose. This supplement has been coordinated and approved by AFLOA/JAJM.

1.2. Unlawful Command Influence (Articles 37 and 98, UCMJ; Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM)
104). The military justice system must operate free of unlawful command influence. Staff Judge Advo-
cates (SJAs), their staffs, and all personnel involved in the military justice process must be sensitive to the
existence, or appearance, of unlawful command influence. Likewise, they must be vigilant and vigorous
in efforts to prevent it and to respond appropriately to its occurrence. SJAs should periodically discuss
with commanders the importance of avoiding even the appearance of unlawful command influence, and
act decisively when apprised of facts or circumstances which might give rise to it.

1.3. Ethics and Standards of Conduct. Legal ethics and expected standards of conduct in the Air Force
are contained in the Air Force Rules of Professional Conduct and Standards for Civility in Professional
Conduct, TJAG Policy Memorandum: TJS-2, and Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice, TJS-3.
     1.3.1. General Application. These rules and standards apply to all military and civilian lawyers,
     paralegals and nonlawyer assistants in The Judge Advocate General’s Corps, USAF.
     1.3.2. Application to Foreign National Attorneys Overseas. These rules and standards apply to all
     foreign national lawyers employed overseas by the Department of the Air Force, to the extent these
     rules are consistent with applicable domestic law and professional standards.
     1.3.3. Application to All Practitioners in Air Force Proceedings. The rules and standards also
     apply to all lawyers, paralegals and nonlawyer assistants who practice in Air Force courts or other
     proceedings, or assist others practicing in such proceedings. This includes, but is not limited to, civil-
     ian defense counsel (and their associates and non-lawyer assistants) who have no connection to the
     USAF other than as participants in such proceedings. Military defense counsel at trial, or appellate
     defense counsel on appeal, shall provide copies of TJS-2, the Rules, and TJS-3, the Standards, to civil-
     ian defense counsel of record. In any case in which military counsel is excused or not detailed, trial
     counsel shall ensure that civilian counsel has been provided the referenced rules and standards.

            COURT-MARTIAL CONVENING AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION

Section 2A—Court-Martial Convening Authority

2.1. General Court-Martial Convening Authority (RCM 504(b)(1)). The following Air Force com-
manders may exercise general court-martial convening authority (GCMCA):
   2.1.1. Commanders of organizations identified by Article 22(a)(7), UCMJ, who have been authorized
   to exercise GCMCA by the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) or the express authorization of TJAG
   to convene GCMs.
   2.1.2. Commanders of organizations not identified by Article 22(a)(7), UCMJ, who are designated
   and authorized to convene GCMs by the SECAF under Article 22(a)(8), UCMJ, or empowered by the
   President under Article 22(a)(9), UCMJ.
   2.1.3. Requests for authorization to exercise GCMCA are forwarded through command channels to
   AFLOA/JAJM.

2.2. Special Court-Martial Convening Authority (RCM 504(b)(2)). The following Air Force com-
manders may exercise special court-martial convening authority (SPCMCA):
   2.2.1. Commanders authorized to convene GCMs under paragraph 2.1.
   2.2.2. Commanders of organizations identified by Article 23(a), UCMJ, who have been authorized to
   exercise SPCMCA by SECAF. Submit requests for SECAF action under Article 23(a)(7) to AFLOA/
   JAJM.
   2.2.3. Commanders of organizations identified by Article 23(a)(4), UCMJ, who are not authorized to
   exercise SPCMCA by SECAF, but are authorized by the appropriate MAJCOM commander to con-
   vene special courts-martial. MAJCOM SJAs send a copy of all such authorizations to AFLOA/JAJM.
   2.2.4. Commanders who are not authorized to exercise SPCMCA by SECAF, but who are authorized
   by the commander of an Air Force component of a unified or specified combatant command. The
   commander of an Air Force component of a unified or specified combatant command may only autho-
   rize subordinate commanders to exercise SPCMCA if the subordinate commander commands an
   organization identified by Article 23, UCMJ, and the subordinate commander commands an organiza-
   tion or unit assigned or attached to the Air Force component commander's command. The Air Force
   component command SJA sends a copy of all such authorizations to AFLOA/JAJM.

2.3. Summary Court-Martial Convening Authority (RCM 504(b)(3), RCM 1302). SPCMCAs and
GCMCAs may convene summary courts-martial (SCM). The commanding officer of a detached squadron
or other detachment of the Air Force may convene a SCM, as provided in Article 24(a)(3), UCMJ, only
with the express authorization of the Air Force GCMCA over the detached squadron or other detachment

18                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


2.4. Court-Martial Convening Authority Actions Involving Tenant Organizations. All members of a
tenant unit or Air Force Element (AFELM), whether designated as a unit or not, are attached to the host
command and its appropriate subordinate and higher commands for the exercise of general, special, and
summary courts-martial convening authority.
     2.4.1. While attachment for court-martial convening authority purposes does not serve to divest any
     other commander from the exercise of such authority over a member of the tenant unit or AFELM, the
     concurrent exercise of such authority by the host command is preferred to expeditiously resolve the
     matter, preserve resources, and retain command prerogatives pertaining to matters affecting the main-
     tenance of good order and discipline within the installation. Members of a tenant unit or AFELM
     include personnel on temporary duty with or otherwise attached to it.
     2.4.2. Exceptions.
        2.4.2.1. When a support agreement differing from that above is necessary or desirable, it must be
        documented at the general court-martial convening authority level or higher.
        2.4.2.2. All judge advocates assigned as senior trial counsel and senior defense counsel, area
        defense counsel, and defense paralegals are exclusively assigned to the Air Force Legal Opera-
        tions Agency (AFLOA) for courts-martial jurisdiction. All personnel assigned to AFLOA are
        exclusively attached to the Air Force District of Washington for court-martial jurisdiction. Mili-
        tary judges are assigned to AFDW for courts-martial jurisdiction.
     2.4.3. Sole Authority. This section is the sole authority for legal service support. No other order,
     writing or implementing agreement is required unless otherwise provided for herein.

2.5. Court-Martial Jurisdiction in Joint Commands (RCM 201(e), Joint Publication O-2). A i r
Force personnel supporting a contingency in a deployed area of operations (AOR) fall under the Air Force
component commander’s chain of command for Military Justice purposes. While a commander of a uni-
fied or specified combatant command may convene courts-martial over members of any of the armed
forces, a joint force commander normally should allow court-martial jurisdiction over Air Force members
to be exercised by the appropriate Air Force convening authority. Air Force convening authorities should
exercise court-martial jurisdiction over members of other services only when warranted by RCM 201(e).
AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization; AFI 51-202, Nonjudicial Punishment (Procedures for Multi-service
Commanders).

2.6. Jurisdiction Involving State or Foreign Prosecution Interest.
     2.6.1. In General. Where an act or omission is subject to trial by court-martial or nonjudicial punish-
     ment proceedings and to trial by state or foreign courts, the determination of which sovereign shall
     exercise jurisdiction should be made through consultation or prior agreement between appropriate Air
     Force and civilian authorities. RCM 201(d). If state or foreign prosecution jurisdiction will not meet/
     or has not met the ends of good order and discipline, it may be appropriate to seek permission from
     SECAF to exercise UCMJ authority. Convening authorities and staff judge advocates should foster
     relationships with local civilian authorities with a view toward maximizing Air Force jurisdiction.
     Except as discussed in 2.6.3., a member who is either pending trial or has been tried by a state or for-
     eign court, regardless of the outcome, should not ordinarily be tried by a court-martial or subjected to
     nonjudicial punishment proceedings for the same act or omission. This limitation does not apply to
     vacation proceedings held under RCM 1109 and Part V, paragraph 6a(4) of the MCM. A member may
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                         19


   be considered to be pending trial when state or foreign authorities have expressed their intention to try
   the member, even if formal charges have not been brought, e.g., upon arrest of the member or a repre-
   sentation by civilian authorities that they intend to pursue the case.
   2.6.2. Procedure. When a member is subject to both UCMJ and state or foreign jurisdiction for sub-
   stantially the same act or omission, Air Force authorities must determine whether the exercise of juris-
   diction is in the best interests of the Air Force. If the exercise of jurisdiction is sought, Air Force
   authorities (normally the SJA) shall contact appropriate civilian or foreign authorities and notify them
   of the Air Force desire for jurisdiction. If civilian or foreign authorities decline to exercise jurisdic-
   tion, the Air Force may proceed with military justice action, whether court-martial or nonjudicial pun-
   ishment. If the civilian or foreign authorities are exercising or express their intention to exercise
   jurisdiction over the member, neither a court-martial nor nonjudicial punishment may proceed as a
   matter of comity until the state or foreign proceedings are completed. Ponzi v. Fessenden, 258 U.S.
   254 (1922); United States v. Panchisin, 30 C.M.R. 921, 924-25 (A.F.B.R. 1961). If the state or foreign
   proceedings end without jeopardy attaching, the Air Force may proceed with nonjudicial punishment
   or court-martial action. If jeopardy attached in the state or foreign proceedings, UCMJ action may not
   be taken unless approved by SECAF.
   2.6.3. Secretarial Approval. Only SECAF may approve initiation of court-martial or nonjudicial
   punishment action against a member previously tried by a state or foreign court for substantially the
   same act or omission, regardless of the outcome. These requests may only be submitted after the
   member has been tried in a state or foreign court. Submit requests, with full justification, through
   command channels to AFLOA/JAJM. SECAF approval will be granted in only the most unusual cases
   when the ends of justice and discipline can be satisfied in no other way. A member shall be deemed
   “tried” by a state or foreign court if:
   2.6.3. (AMC) Secretarial Exception. Coordinate any request for Secretarial Exception through 18
   AF/JA and HQ AMC/JA.
       2.6.3.1. Jeopardy has attached. Follow the state or foreign law to determine when this occurs.
       At a minimum, jeopardy attaches when the jury is impaneled and sworn, or when the first witness
       testifies in a judge alone trial. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28 (1978). State law may consider a member
       “tried” even if the court ultimately suspends judgment upon discharge of the accused following
       probation, permits withdrawal of the guilty plea, or applies some form of alternative sentencing.
          2.6.3.1.1. A member will not be deemed “tried” if the prosecution is deferred, held in abey-
          ance, or otherwise diverted from normal channels pending completion of one or more condi-
          tions as an alternative to prosecution without an initial judicial determination of guilt. As a
          matter of Air Force policy, UCMJ action is impermissible without first seeking SECAF
          approval. If deferral, abeyance or diversion is conditional and the member remains subject to
          prosecution should he or she violates a condition, UCMJ action should not be taken until after
          the deferral, abeyance or diversion is completed.

2.7. Jurisdiction Involving Federal Agencies.
   2.7.1. Department of Justice (DOJ). The MCM, Appendix 3, (DoD Directive 5525.7, Implementa-
   tion of the Memorandum of Understanding Between the Department of Justice and the Department of
   Defense Relating to the Investigation and Prosecution of Certain Crimes and DoDI 5525.07, Imple-
   mentation of the MOU Between Department of Justice and Department of Defense Relating to the
20                                                            AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


     Investigation and Prosecution of Certain Crimes), sets forth DoD and DOJ responsibilities for inves-
     tigating and prosecuting offenses over which the two departments have concurrent jurisdiction.
     2.7.2. U.S. Secret Service. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) exercises primary investigative responsi-
     bility for all cases involving alleged threats against the President or successors to the Presidency. 18
     U.S.C. § 3056. The Chief, AFLOA/JAJM, or a designee, will meet with representatives of DOJ and
     USSS to determine which department will exercise further jurisdiction in the case.
     2.7.3. The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000 (18 U.S.C. §§ 3261 et seq) (MEJA).
     Military members, as well as civilians accompanying the force, may be subject to United States civil-
     ian federal jurisdiction for offenses committed while overseas. Submit a report of any potential case
     involving MEJA, through command channels, to AFLOA/JAJM. See AFI 51-1001, Delivery of Per-
     sonnel to United States Civilian Authorities for Trial, and AFPD 51-10, Making Military Personnel,
     Employees, and Dependents Available to Civilian Authorities for substantive procedural guidance and
     procedures.

Section 2C—Completion of Service

2.8. Completion of Military Service (RCM 202).
     2.8.1. Court-martial jurisdiction extends to those persons whose enlistments have expired, but are
     awaiting discharge. Article 2(a)(1) and Article 3(a), UCMJ. Action with a view to trial must be taken
     as soon as practicable to preserve jurisdiction. RCM 202(c).
     2.8.2. Generally, jurisdiction to try a member of the military by court-martial ceases upon discharge
     or other separation. Jurisdiction over active duty military personnel normally continues until the mem-
     ber receives a valid discharge certificate, there is a final accounting of pay, and the member has com-
     pleted administrative clearance processes required by his or her service Secretary. United States. v.
     King, 27 M.J. 327, 329 (C.M.A. 1989). SJAs should recognize that exceptions to this general rule
     might apply including regaining military jurisdiction for members upon reentry into military service.
     See RCM 202(a), Discussion (2)(B)(iii) and RCM 204(d). If the matter results in trial by court-mar-
     tial, the record of trial (ROT) must include evidence that establishes jurisdiction over the accused.

Section 2D—Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard Members

2.9. Jurisdiction Over Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard Members (RCM 202).
     2.9.1. In General. Air National Guard Members while in Federal status and Air Reserve members
     including retired members are subject to UCMJ jurisdiction for offenses committed while on active
     duty or on inactive duty training status. Reserve members performing continuous duty in an inactive
     duty for training status overseas are subject to UCMJ jurisdiction from the commencement to the con-
     clusion of such duty. Air National Guard (ANG) members are subject to UCMJ jurisdiction only when
     in Federal service. (Title 10).
     2.9.2. Courts-Martial. Once jurisdiction attaches in accordance with RCM 202(c), a member of a
     reserve component may either be retained on active duty pending disposition of offenses, or be
     released to reserve status and recalled as necessary for pretrial investigation, court-martial, or both. If
     the member is no longer on active duty when the offense is discovered, the member may be involun-
     tarily ordered to active duty for a pretrial investigation, trial by court-martial, or both. In any case in
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                     21


  which the accused is a member of the Reserve or Air National Guard, trial counsel must introduce suf-
  ficient evidence to establish in-personam jurisdiction over the accused at the time of the offense.
  2.9.3. Summary Courts-Martial and Nonjudicial Punishment. Do not involuntarily recall a
  reserve member to active duty solely to impose nonjudicial punishment or for trial by SCM. Initiate
  nonjudicial punishment or an SCM during the member's next period of inactive duty training or active
  duty. MAJCOM commanders or equivalents may grant waivers to this restriction in appropriate cases.
  2.9.3. (AMC) Summary Courts-Martial and Nonjudicial Punishment. AMC/CC delegates the
  authority to grant waivers to AMC/CV.
  2.9.4. Recall Authority. The following may order a Reserve or Air National Guard member to active
  duty:
     2.9.4.1. A GCMCA for the regular component unit to which the member is attached for training
     purposes;
     2.9.4.2. A GCMCA for the regular component unit in which the member performed duty when
     the offense(s) occurred;
     2.9.4.3. A GCMCA of the regular component host unit, as designated in the applicable host-ten-
     ant support agreement if the member is assigned to a reserve component unit for training purposes,
     or was attached to such a unit when the offense(s) occurred; or
     2.9.4.4. AFRC/CC, 4 AF/CC, 10 AF/CC, or 22 AF/CC for members assigned or attached to their
     respective commands.
  2.9.5. Limitations on Punishment. A Reserve or Air National Guard member recalled to active duty
  for court-martial may not be sentenced to confinement, or be required to serve a punishment consist-
  ing of any restriction on liberty during the recall period of duty, without SECAF approval. See Article
  2(d)(5), UCMJ. A punishment of restriction to specified limits may be imposed only during periods of
  inactive duty training or active duty ordered for routine (non-disciplinary) purposes. Requests for
  SECAF approval to recall a reserve member for court-martial to preserve the possibility that the sen-
  tence may include confinement are forwarded, via command channels, to AFLOA/JAJM. Generally,
  requests should be made prior to preferral of charges, but, in any case, must be approved prior to
  arraignment. The GCMCA must concur in the request and the request shall include as a minimum, the
  following information:
     2.9.5.1. The preferred or anticipated charges and specifications. When charges have been pre-
     ferred, attach a copy of the charge sheet and personal data sheet.
     2.9.5.2. A summary of the evidence relating to each offense. Attach copies of any reports of
     investigation/inquiry or witness statements.
     2.9.5.3. Prior convictions and nonjudicial punishments.
     2.9.5.4. Whether the member refused an offer of nonjudicial punishment.
     2.9.5.5. The member's background, including civilian employment, family circumstances, and
     character of military service.
     2.9.5.6. Consultation, if any, with the member's reserve component chain of command, such as
     the unit commander (state adjutant general for an ANG member performing Federal service).
22                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


Section 2E—Retired Personnel

2.10. Jurisdiction Over Retired Air Force Personnel. Retired regular Air Force personnel who are
entitled to receive pay (Article 2(a)(4), UCMJ), retired members of a reserve component who are receiv-
ing hospitalization from an armed service (Article 2(a)(5), UCMJ), and retired members of a reserve com-
ponent subject to lawful orders to return to duty (See Morgan v. Mahoney, 50 M.J. 633 (1999), will not be
tried by court-martial for acts/omissions while on active duty or inactive duty training, within the statute
of limitations, unless their conduct clearly links them with the military or is adverse to a significant mili-
tary interest of the United States. SECAF approval is required prior to preferral of charges unless there is
an immediate statute of limitations problem. If the time prescribed by the statute of limitations is about to
expire, prefer charges and request SECAF approval as soon as possible. Send requests for approval, with
full justification, to AFLOA/JAJM.

Section 2F—General Officers

2.11. Jurisdiction Over General Officers. Only commanders of Air Force MAJCOMs and superior
convening authority’s may exercise court-martial convening authority over Air Force general officers.
This limitation does not apply to the exercise of court-martial convening authority by the commanding
officer of a unified command.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                        23


                                                Chapter 3

           MILITARY MAGISTRATES, PRETRIAL RESTRAINT, AND PREFERRAL

Section 3A—Military Magistrates

3.1. Military Magistrate Program.
   3.1.1. Appointment of Magistrate (MRE 315(d)(2)). The commander of the lowest organizational
   level having command over an Air Force installation, who is either an SPCMCA or GCMCA, or the
   installation commander at Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) bases and stations, may appoint a
   maximum of two officers with judicial temperament to serve as military magistrates for that installa-
   tion. If unique circumstances exist that warrant the appointment of more than two magistrates, permis-
   sion to appoint additional magistrates must be obtained from the GCMCA and approved by AFLOA/
   JAJM. Appoint magistrates in writing by name, not position, and specify the installation over which
   the magistrates may exercise authority.
   3.1.2. Qualifications. A military magistrate should be an officer serving in the grade of lieutenant
   colonel or above. The appointment of any magistrate in the rank of major or below may only be made
   by, or with the concurrence of, the GCMCA exercising jurisdiction over the installation. Chaplains,
   SJA office personnel, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) and Security Forces (SF)
   members, and court-martial convening authorities may not serve as military magistrates. Officers
   appointed at AFRC installations must be serving a period of inactive duty training or active duty to
   perform magistrate duties.
   3.1.3. Authority. A military magistrate issues search and seizure, and apprehension authorizations
   based upon probable cause. If two magistrates are appointed for an installation, each exercises concur-
   rent authority with the other and with the installation commander. The commander need not be
   unavailable for a magistrate to exercise this authority.
   3.1.4. Non-Air Force Military Installations. The Air Force commander who is either an SPCMCA
   or GCMCA at a military installation where the installation commander is not an Air Force commander
   may appoint an officer with judicial temperament to serve as a military magistrate for matters involv-
   ing Air Force personnel on the installation. A military magistrate appointed under this paragraph is
   authorized to issue search and seizure and apprehension authorizations, based on probable cause,
   involving Air Force personnel at non-Air Force military installations to the extent the commander
   appointing the military magistrate has control over the place where the property or person to be
   searched is situated or found, or over the person to be apprehended. MRE 315(d)(1). This military
   magistrate exercises concurrent authority with the commander who appointed him or her.
   3.1.5. SJA Duties. The SJA for the commander appointing military magistrates should brief military
   magistrates on their duties at the time of their appointment and whenever necessary thereafter.

Section 3B—Pretrial Confinement and Restraint

3.2. Pretrial Confinement (RCM 305). An authorized person must determine if there is probable cause
to order pretrial confinement. Once the member is placed in pretrial confinement, additional steps must
occur to determine if it is appropriate to continue pretrial confinement - a 48-hour probable cause determi-
nation, a 72-hour commander’s decision and memorandum, and a pretrial confinement review (within 7
24                                                          AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


days). Normally, offenses to be disposed of by summary court-martial do not warrant pretrial confine-
ment.
     3.2.1. Probable Cause for Pretrial Confinement. No person may be ordered into pretrial confine-
     ment except for probable cause. Probable cause to order pretrial confinement exists when there is a
     reasonable belief that an offense triable by court-martial has been committed, the person confined
     committed it, and confinement is required by the circumstances. Additional matters to consider
     include the person’s background and character, the details of the offense, and the matters in the Dis-
     cussion following RCM 305(h)(2)(B). The person who directs confinement need not conduct a
     detailed analysis of the circumstances before physically detaining the person if time does not permit.
     See RCM 305(d).
     3.2.2. 48-Hour Probable Cause Determination. Within 48 hours of the imposition of confinement
     under military control, a neutral and detached officer must review the adequacy of probable cause to
     continue pretrial confinement. RCM 305(i)(1); Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 124-25 (1975);
     County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44 (1991). See format at Figure 3.1. If the determination
     is not made within 48 hours, the government may have to establish the existence of a bona fide emer-
     gency or other extraordinary circumstances. The determination should be in writing and included in
     the Record of Trial (ROT).
        3.2.2.1. Include in the ROT any documentation regarding a determination of probable cause made
        by civilian authorities prior to transfer of the member to military authorities. When a military
        member is transferred from civilian confinement to military control, authorities must still conduct
        a 48-hour probable cause determination.
        3.2.2.2. Factors to consider in determining whether an officer is neutral and detached include
        whether the officer is the formal accuser on the charge sheet, is the officer who ordered the
        accused into confinement, or is directly or particularly involved in the command’s law enforce-
        ment functions. United States v. Rexroat, 38 M.J. 292 (C.M.A. 1993); United States v. Lynch, 13
        M.J. 394 (C.M.A. 1982).
        3.2.2.3. The Pretrial Confinement Review in paragraph 3.2.4. will satisfy the 48-hour probable
        cause determination if the Pretrial Confinement Review memorandum is completed within 48
        hours of the imposition of confinement.
     3.2.3. 72-Hour Commander’s Decision and Memorandum. A commander shall decide whether to
     continue pretrial confinement not later than 72 hours after the commander orders a military member
     into pretrial confinement, or after receipt of a report that a member of the commander’s unit or orga-
     nization has been confined. The commander must address the requirements for confinement in RCM
     305(h)(2)(B) and should consider the factors in the Discussion to that section. If the commander
     decides to continue pretrial confinement, he or she must prepare a written memorandum in accordance
     with RCM 305(h)(2)(C). The memorandum is then forwarded to the Pretrial Confinement Review
     Officer, through the SJA and SPCMCA. If court-martial results, the commander’s memorandum must
     be included in the ROT. Figure 3.3. provides a sample format.
        3.2.3.1. The 72-hour commander’s decision will satisfy the 48-hour probable cause determination
        only if the commander is neutral and detached and acts within 48 hours of the imposition of con-
        finement. RCM 305(h)(2)(A). See Figure 3.3.
     3.2.4. Pretrial Confinement Review (PCR), (RCM 305(i)(2)). Within 7 days of the imposition of
     pretrial confinement under military control, a Pretrial Confinement Review Officer (PCRO) must
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                      25


  review the probable cause determination and make a decision about the necessity for continued pre-
  trial confinement. United States v. McCants, 39 M.J. 91 (C.M.A. 1994).
     3.2.4.1. Appointment of PCROs, (RCM 305(i)(2)). The SPCMCA appoints, by letter, a reason-
     able number of mature officers to serve as PCROs. Chaplains, SJA office personnel, AFOSI and
     SF members, and court-martial convening authorities may not serve as a PCRO. Military magis-
     trates may also be appointed as PCROs. Except in unusual circumstances, a magistrate should not
     serve as the PCRO if he or she otherwise acted upon the same case in any capacity.
     3.2.4.2. The PCRO must review the commander’s decision to continue pretrial confinement satis-
     fying the 72-hour requirement. The PCRO should consider any matters submitted by the pretrial
     confinee.
         3.2.4.2.1. The PCR may satisfy the 48-hour probable cause determination requirement if the
         PCR decision is completed within 48 hours of the imposition of confinement. In such cases,
         the PCR memorandum must specifically state when the probable cause determination was
         made.
     3.2.4.3. The PCRO conducts a hearing at which the pretrial confinee and defense counsel shall be
     allowed to appear and make a statement before the PCRO, if practicable. A government represen-
     tative, usually a judge advocate, may also make a statement, if practicable. Although the PCR is
     not an adversarial proceeding, the PCRO may exercise his or her discretion by allowing the pre-
     trial confinee, defense counsel or government representative to present evidence or cross-examine
     witnesses. The PCRO must complete a written summary of the testimony of any witnesses. The
     only rules of evidence that apply are MRE 302, MRE 305 and MRE 501 - 513 (Section V - Privi-
     leges).
     3.2.4.4. Upon completion of the PCR, the PCRO shall approve continued confinement or order
     immediate release. To continue pretrial confinement, the PCRO must find the requirements of
     RCM 305(h)(2)(B) have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence to continue pretrial con-
     finement. If the requirements of RCM 305(h)(2)(B) have not been proven, the PCRO must order
     immediate release of the pretrial confinee. The PCRO may not impose conditions on release, but
     may recommend the commander impose a less severe form of pretrial restraint. If the PCRO
     orders release, a commander may impose any alternative lesser form of pretrial restraint autho-
     rized by RCM 304(a)(1) through (3).
     3.2.4.5. Within 24 hours of making the pretrial confinement decision, the PCRO must complete a
     memorandum of the PCRO’s conclusions and the findings on which they are based. A copy of all
     documents and summaries of all oral statements considered by the PCRO must be attached to the
     memorandum. The memorandum with attachments shall be provided to the SPCMCA, the SPC-
     MCA’s SJA, the confinement officer, the pretrial confinee and the pretrial confinee’s defense
     counsel. Figure 3.4. provides a sample format for the PCRO’s memorandum.
  3.2.5. Pretrial Restraint Upon Release From Confinement. A commander may impose any alter-
  native lesser form of pretrial restraint authorized by RCM 304(a)(1) through (3), if release is ordered
  by the PCRO. Re-confinement after release is limited to circumstances provided in RCM 305(l).
  United States v. Mahoney, 36 M.J. 679 (A.F.C.M.R. 1992). The requirements of this chapter apply to
  a member upon imposition of re-confinement.
  3.2.6. Pretrial Restraint as Suicide Prevention. Preventing an accused from committing suicide is
  not valid as the sole basis for ordering the accused into or continuing pretrial confinement. A distinc-
26                                                            AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


     tion shall be drawn between an accused that is a threat to him or herself and an accused that is either a
     threat to flee the jurisdiction to avoid prosecution or is a threat to commit a serious offense. The latter
     may be placed in pretrial confinement in accordance with RCM 305(h)(2)(B). The former should be
     referred to mental health practitioners for evaluation and treatment and, if necessary, involuntary com-
     mitment in a mental health facility. United States v. Doane, 54 M.J. 978, 982 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App.
     2001).
     3.2.7. Pretrial Determination of Mental Competence. A convening authority may determine the
     place and condition of pretrial detention, including confinement in a civilian facility, for the purpose
     of evaluating the competency of the accused, subject to review by a military judge for abuse of discre-
     tion. The conditions may not be more harsh than necessary to ensure the accused's presence at trial.
     The facility must be capable of rendering the necessary competency evaluations and providing neces-
     sary care and treatment of the accused. Article 13, UCMJ; RCM 706, 909; Short v. Chambers, 33 M.J.
     49 (C.M.A. 1991); 18 U.S.C. § 4241.
     3.2.8. SJA Duties. SJAs must ensure confinement personnel advise pretrial confinees in accordance
     with RCM 305(e). SJAs must ensure PCROs are briefed on their duties when appointed, and updated
     as appropriate thereafter. SJAs must notify alleged victims of a confinee's pretrial confinement and
     release from pretrial confinement. Consult AFI 51-703, Foreign Criminal Jurisdiction, if a member is
     confined at the request of foreign host nation authorities.

Section 3C—Preferral of Charges (RCM 307)

3.3. Considerations Prior to Preferral of Charges.
     3.3.1. Accuser is Senior to the Convening Authority. Consult RCM 504(c)(2) and (3) when the
     accuser is senior in rank to the convening authority.
     3.3.2. Authority To Proceed in Cases Involving an Accused with Special Access. D o n o t t a k e
     action on personnel who hold or have held access to Single Integrated Operation Plan-Extremely Sen-
     sitive Information (SIOP-ESI), Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), research and develop-
     ment (R&D) special access program, AFOSI special access program, or other special access program
     information until the appropriate special access program office approves. Legal offices ensure compli-
     ance with AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management. In accordance with AFI 31-501,
     paragraph 8.9., commanders must submit a written request to the appropriate special access program
     functional office for permission to proceed with further processing before initiating action against mil-
     itary members that could lead to a discharge. The legal office must also ensure a copy of the com-
     mander’s written request is sent to AFLOA/JAJM. Apply security classification according to message
     contents and send through classified channels as required. In accordance with AFI 31-501, paragraph
     8.9.8, if a commander contemplates a general or special court-martial, processing of the case may pro-
     ceed with preferral of charges and completion of the investigation required by Article 32, UCMJ,
     together with collateral actions required under Article 32. Under no circumstances may the charges be
     referred to trial until the appropriate action office grants authority to proceed. It is recommended that
     authority to proceed be sought before preferral and as soon as possible due to the length of time it
     takes to process these requests.
     3.3.3. Preferral in Lengthy Absence Cases. Effective 14 November 1986, summary court-martial
     convening authorities (SCMCAs) are no longer required to receipt for charges alleging either deser-
     tion or absent without leave (AWOL) in order to toll the statute of limitations. Article 43, UCMJ.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                          27


   Therefore, where an unauthorized absence began after 14 November 1986, preferral and receipt for
   charges is not required to toll the statute of limitations. For all lengthy absence cases for which
   charges were preferred on or before 14 November 1986 where the member has not yet returned to mil-
   itary control, preferred charges, receipted for by the SCMCA are still required to toll the limitations
   period. The servicing SJA should obtain a written delay from the appropriate convening authority to
   stop the running of the RCM 707 speedy trial rule. Documentation of approved delays shall be
   attached to the charge sheet in the member's personnel records before sending the records to the Air
   Force Personnel Center. AFI 36-2911, Desertion and Unauthorized Absence. Charges for desertion or
   an unauthorized absence, either of which began before 14 November 1986, where there was no prefer-
   ral and receipt of charges, are not viable.
   3.3.4. Extension Beyond Expiration of Term of Service (ETS). Airman may be retained beyond
   their ETS in anticipation of the preferral of charges. If there is sufficient time, the SJA must notify the
   MPF separations unit in writing. If time does not permit written notification, written confirmation of
   the verbal notice should be provided to the MPF within five duty days. See AFI 36-3208, Administra-
   tive Separation of Airman, and AFCSM 36-699 Volume 1, Personnel Data Systems User Manual,
   Table 7B1, for guidelines, sample letters and rules regarding the length of extensions.
   3.3.5. Accused With Prior Adjudged Punitive Discharge. If an accused has an approved, but
   unexecuted, prior punitive discharge, the SJA for the SPCMCA over the accused shall immediately
   notify AFLOA/JAJM by voice message, e-mail, or facsimile notice concerning preferral of new
   charges, with information copies sent to the appropriate GCM and MAJCOM SJAs. This notice
   enables JAJM to ensure that the execution of the previous punitive discharge does not occur, provid-
   ing continuing court-martial jurisdiction over the accused.
   3.3.5. (AMC) Accused with Prior Adjudged Punitive Discharge. Send an information copy to HQ
   AMC/JAAM, 102 E. Martin St., Rm N-119, Scott AFB IL 62225-5012 and 18 AF/JA, 102 E. Martin
   St., Ste N-100, Scott AFB IL 62225.
   3.3.6. Recoupment. If an accused received education assistance, special pay, or bonus money and
   faces separation or discharge before completion of the agreed upon period of active duty, notice of
   recoupment should be given when court-martial charges are preferred in accordance with Title 10,
   United States Code, Section 2005(g). The member should sign a statement of understanding regarding
   recoupment as shown in Figure 3.5. This notice is included in the ROT with pretrial allied papers in
   accordance with AFMAN 51-203, Records of Trial, Figure 4.1., paragraph 20.

3.4. Charge Sheet Preparation.
   3.4.1. Charge Sheet. Prepare charges and specifications on the DD Form 458, Charge Sheet. The
   Charge Sheet should be prepared by inputting the data into AMJAMS and printing out the electronic
   version of the DD Form 458. Information in AMJAMS should be reflected as follows:
   3.4.2. Blocks 1, 2, 3 and 4. Autofill information in AMJAMS from AFPC and ensure its accuracy.
   Make pen and ink changes to the charge sheet to reflect any change in the accused's grade prior to
   arraignment by lining through and keeping the information legible. Initial any changes.
   3.4.3. Block 5. Enter the accused's assigned organization under the Duty Status tab in AMJAMS. The
   address should reflect the base name, state and zip. Ensure the correct pull down is selected for your
   MAJCOM. At squadron level, enter "111th Civil Engineer Squadron," not "111th Civil Engineering
   Squadron Section."
28                                                            AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


     3.4.4. Block 6. The accused's current service is the date the current enlistment began for enlisted per-
     sonnel and the Total Active Federal Military Service Date (TAFMSD) for officers. Extensions do not
     change the current enlistment date. This information can be found in the accused's personnel records
     or in the record review listing prepared by the servicing personnel office. Double check the RIPS
     against the information autofilled from AFPC.
     3.4.5. Block 7. The accused's current pay per month will be entered automatically, this will need to be
     to changed if AFPC lists the incorrect rank. If it changes prior to arraignment, correct it with a pen and
     ink change.
     3.4.6. Blocks 8 and 9. Include any form of restraint, including restraint by civil authorities at the
     behest of the Air Force, by adding the pretrial restraint folder under the pretrial information in
     AMJAMS. An example of this is when a member in an AWOL or deserter status is apprehended pur-
     suant to a DD Form 553, Deserter/Absentee Wanted by the Armed Forces, by civilian police and incar-
     cerated or detained until Air Force officials take custody of the accused.
     3.4.7. Charges and Specifications. Consult RCM 307 and refer to the sample specifications in the
     MCM, Part IV, and the Military Judge’s Benchbook, DA Pamphlet 27-9. AMJAMS will auto-fill the
     charge and specification indicators in automatically.
        3.4.7.1. Format. Type the words "CHARGE" and "ADDITIONAL CHARGE" in all capital let-
        ters. "Specification” includes upper and lower case letters. Where more than one charge or speci-
        fication is alleged, charges are numbered with Roman numerals (e.g., I, II, III) and specifications
        with Arabic numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3). A single charge or specification is not numbered.
        3.4.7.2. Additional Charges. When additional charges are preferred, add “Additional Charges
        Preferred.” AMJAMS will label the charges as ADDITIONAL CHARGES. If charges are pre-
        ferred after preferral of additional charges, add another “Additional Charges Preferred” folder in
        AMJAMS. AMJAMS will label each new set of charges with written numbers (e.g., SECOND
        ADDITIONAL CHARGES, THIRD ADDITIONAL CHARGES).
        3.4.7.3. Identification of Accused. In the specifications, identify the accused by present grade,
        followed by the grade on the date of the alleged offense, if different. Use all capital letters. Do not
        include the MAJCOM. List known aliases. For example: "In that TECHNICAL SERGEANT
        ADAM J. SMITH, United States Air Force, then MASTER SERGEANT ADAM J. SMITH, alias
        CAPTAIN JAY J. SMITH, United States Air Force, 401st Maintenance Squadron, did, . . . ."
        3.4.7.4. Identification of Victim. If the alleged victim is identified in the specification, do not
        put the victim's name or grade in all capital letters. Do not substitute initials for the name of child
        or sex offense victims, as is required on court-martial orders. See paragraph 10.7. of this instruc-
        tion.
        3.4.7.5. Pleading Check Cases. Where a check or other instrument appears regularly in all
        respects, the contents need not be pled verbatim. In such cases, consider using the model specifi-
        cations provided in the Military Judges’ Benchbook, DA Pamphlet 27-9 or the sample specifica-
        tions provided at Figure 3.2. If in doubt, plead the check verbatim, but include only the portions
        applicable at the time of the offense.

3.5. Forwarding Charges (RCM 401). The commander forwards the charges to the convening author-
ity by attaching an indorsement (Figure 3.6.) to the DD Form 458. Attach a personal data sheet on the
accused (Figure 3.7.) and a copy of the report of investigation or other evidence supporting the charges.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                      29


The commander signs and dates the indorsement when preferring charges or when forwarding charges
preferred by another. Address the indorsement to the officer exercising SPCMCA over the accused. If
additional charges are later added, forward them with a new indorsement.

3.6. Receipt for Charges (RCM 403). A judge advocate may receipt for charges on behalf of the
SCMCA if the convening authority delegates that authority. If delegated, receive the charges "FOR THE
COMMANDER."

3.7. Discovery. SJAs and Trial Counsel are strongly encouraged to provide discovery to defense counsel
as soon as practicable. This may be prior to the preferral of charges.
   3.7.1. At the time charges are preferred, the Trial Counsel should, as a minimum, provide defense
   counsel the following matters:
       3.7.1.1. A copy of DD Form 458;
       3.7.1.2. A copy of the commander’s indorsement to the DD Form 458 with all attachments; and
       3.7.1.3. A copy of any report of investigation and any signed or sworn statements relating to the
       offense charged, unless the government claims that the documents or portions thereof are pro-
       tected from release, or disclosure will have an adverse impact on an ongoing or proposed law
       enforcement investigation.
   3.7.2. Defense counsel will be provided the opportunity to inspect items of physical evidence upon
   request and when reasonably available at the time charges are preferred or within a reasonable time
   thereafter.
   3.7.3. These provisions are not intended to create any new substantive rights to discovery beyond
   those contained in the Rules for Courts-Martial. After referral of charges to trial, discovery shall be
   made by both trial and defense counsel in accordance with the Rules for Courts-Martial.

SUBJECT: Probable Cause Determination - (grade, name)


1. In accordance with RCM 305(i)(1), I, being a neutral and detached officer acting within 48 hours of
imposition of confinement under military control, find adequate probable cause that the following
offense(s) triable by court-martial [(was)(were)] committed and that (GRADE, NAME) committed
[(it)(them)]:


        Article         Date of Offense         Description of Offense
        a. _________________            __________________
        b. ______       ____________            __________________


2. Second, I have reasonable grounds to believe continued pretrial confinement is necessary because it is
foreseeable that the confinee will not appear at [trial, pretrial hearing, or investigation,] and/or will engage
in serious criminal misconduct. Finally, I have reasonable grounds to believe less severe forms of restraint
are inadequate.

SUBJECT: Pretrial Confinement of (Grade)(Name)


1. In accordance with RCM 305(h)(2), I approve the continued pretrial confinement of (GRADE, NAME,
UNIT).


2. Background Information:


   a. Personal Data:
       (1) Age:
       (2) AFSC: (number and job description)
       (3) Total Service to Date:
       (4) DEROS:

       (6) Number of Children (if any):


   b. Prior Disciplinary Action:


      (1) Previous Convictions: (include type of court, date, charges on which member convicted, and
punishment)
      (2) Previous Nonjudicial Punishment: (include date, description of offense(s), and punishment
imposed)
       (3) Other Disciplinary Actions:

3. I conclude the requirements for pretrial confinement in RCM 305(h)(2)(B) are met. First, I have reason-
able grounds to believe the following offense(s) triable by court-martial [(was)(were)] committed and the
confinee committed [(it)(them)]:


          Article      Date of Offense        Description of Offense
     a.   ______       ____________           __________________
     b. ______         ____________           __________________


The attached documents support these conclusions. Second, I have reasonable grounds to believe contin-
ued pretrial confinement is necessary because it is foreseeable that the confinee will not appear at [trial,
pretrial hearing, or investigation], and/or will engage in serious criminal misconduct. Finally, I have rea-
sonable grounds to believe less severe forms of restraint are inadequate.


4. Specific reasons supporting my conclusions that the requirements for continued pretrial confinement in
RCM 305(h)(2)(B) are met include: [State reasons. Consider the factors enumerated in the Discussion to
RCM 305(h)(2)(B).]


5. [OPTIONAL: If the commander is neutral and detached and this memorandum is completed within 48
hours of imposition of confinement, add the following sentence if this memorandum is intended to also
satisfy the 48-hour probable cause determination required by RCM 305(i)(1): Finally, in accordance with
RCM 305(i)(1), I, being a neutral and detached officer acting within 48 hours of imposition of confine-
ment under military control, find adequate probable cause that the offense(s) in paragraph 2 [(was)(were)]
committed and that the confinee committed [(it)(them)].

MEMORANDUM FOR (CONVENING AUTHORITY)


FROM: PRETRIAL CONFINEMENT REVIEW OFFICER


SUBJECT: Pretrial Confinement Review - (Grade, name, and organization of confinee)


1. PRELIMINARY MATTERS. Pursuant to AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice, Chapter 3,
Section 3B, and RCM 305, I was appointed pretrial confinement review officer on (date) by (name and
position of commander). The case of the above named confinee was referred to me by (name of appropri-
ate commander) at (hours) on (date) at (place). At the beginning of the hearing, I advised the accused of

        a. (Summarize each offense. “Legal” language is not necessary, but give the date, place, and gen-
eral description of each offense including facts which indicate seriousness, such as value of property
allegedly stolen or destroyed, or the extent of personal injury allegedly inflicted or threatened, etc.).


       b. ………………………..


3. ENTRY INTO CONFINEMENT. The confinee was placed into pretrial confinement at (name and
location of confinement facility) on (date), pursuant to the order of (Name, rank and organization of the
member who ordered the confinee into confinement). (Attach the confinement order to this report).


4. DEFENSE PARTICIPATION. (Name of confinee) and his/her counsel, (Name of military/civilian coun-
sel), (were) (were not) present during the hearing. (If not present, state why not). (If present: The confinee
and counsel (presented) (did not wish to present) evidence at the hearing.

       b. ……………………..


6. FINDINGS: After considering the evidence (summarized above) and the attached documents, I (do)
(do not) find probable cause to believe the confinee committed the offense(s) for which he/she is held. In
addition, I (do) (do not) find continued pretrial confinement is required under the criteria set forth under
RCM 305(h)(2)(B) for the following reasons:


         a. (List the factual findings that support your decision. The RCM 305(h)(2)(B) criteria, that must
be addressed, are 1) an offense triable by a court-martial has been committed; 2) the confinee committed
it; 3) confinement is necessary because it is foreseeable that: (a) the confinee will not appear at trial, pre-
trial hearing, or investigation, or (b) the confinee will engage in serious criminal misconduct; and, 4) less
severe forms of restraint are inadequate. When conducting your analysis, consider and apply the addi-
tional factors enumerated in RCM 305(h(2)(B) Discussion.


       b. ………………………


7. DECISION. In accordance with the above findings, (name of confinee) will be [(continued in pretrial
confinement pending trial) (released from pretrial confinement)]. (Recommendations for lesser forms of
pretrial restraint, if any, should be addressed in a separate paragraph 8 below - See RCM 304(a).


8. RECOMMENDATION. (If applicable, add this paragraph to set forth your recommendation and rea-
sons for lesser forms of pretrial restraint).

Figure 3.5. Sample Statements of Understanding Regarding Recoupment


                STATEMENT OF UNDERSTANDING REGARDING
        RECOUPMENT OF EDUCATION ASSISTANCE, SPECIAL PAY, OR BONUSES


I understand that the Air Force may be entitled to recoup a portion of education assistance, special pay, or
bonus money which I received, if any, if I separate before completing the period of active duty I agreed to
serve. I understand this recoupment applies regardless of whether I voluntarily separate or I am involun-
tarily discharged. I further understand: (1) the recoupment in all cases is an amount that bears the same
ratio to the total amount or cost provided to me, as the unserved portion of active duty bears to the total
period of active duty I agreed to serve; and (2) that if I dispute that I am indebted for educational assis-
tance, a board or other authority will make findings and recommendations concerning the validity of the
indebtedness.

tion)


FROM: (Squadron CC)


TO: (SPCMCA)


[Briefly describe the accused's character of service prior to the date of the offense(s) charged. Include
comments relating to duty performance, attitude, amenability to discipline, and rehabilitation potential.]
I recommend the charges be referred to trial by (summary) (special) (general) court-martial. The [(Secu-
rity Forces report) (AFOSI report of investigation) (other evidence)] is attached and supports the
charge(s). [If applicable, insert: (The accused was offered and declined nonjudicial punishment.) (The
victim(s) and witness(es) have been informed of the preferral of charges.)] Due to the (severity) (nature)
of the charges, I (do) (do not) believe retention on active duty is appropriate if (he) (she) is convicted. The
accused (is) (is not) subject to the restrictions identified in AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Man-
agement, paragraph 8.9. [A written request for permission to proceed with further processing of this case
has been forwarded to the appropriate special access office.]

                       FORWARDING AND DISPOSITION OF CHARGES

Section 4A—Article 32, UCMJ, Investigations

4.1. Article 32, UCMJ, Investigations (RCM 404(e), 405, 406(b)(2), 601(d)).
   4.1.1. Requirement for an Article 32 Investigation. Before any charge(s) or specification(s) may
   be referred to a general court-martial for trial, a thorough and impartial investigation into the matters
   set forth in the charge(s) and specification(s) must be made.
   4.1.2. Investigating Officer (IO).
       4.1.2.1. Appointment. The convening authority directs an Article 32 investigation by personally
       appointing the IO in writing. See sample appointment letter at Figure 4.1. All documents provided
       to the IO before the investigation must be listed as attachments. The charge sheet and the written
       evidence, which forms the basis for the charge, should be attached to the IO Appointment Letter.
       Normally these documents are the same as those attached to the commander’s indorsement to the
       charge sheet. The IO is not required to consider this evidence in the investigation. The IO ensures
       a copy of the Appointment Letter is provided to the accused before the Article 32 investigation
       begins.
       4.1.2.2. Qualification of the IO. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the IO must be senior in
       rank to the accused. An IO must either be a designated judge advocate or hold the grade of major
       or higher. An IO may be a reserve judge advocate on active duty or performing inactive duty train-
       ing. ANG judge advocates must be on Title 10 orders to serve as an IO. The accuser may not act
       as IO. The IO must be impartial. Before appointing an officer to serve as an IO, the convening
       authority should consider the appointment in the context of the officer’s normally assigned duties
       and assess whether the IO’s impartiality could be questioned based on his/her relationship with the
       case, the parties, and the base legal office.
   4.1.3. Counsel.
       4.1.3.1. Government Representative. The convening authority may personally detail, or autho-
       rize the servicing SJA to detail, a government representative as counsel to represent the United
       States. RCM 405(d)(3). Both the detail of a government representative and the authorization to
       allow the SJA to detail a government representative may be verbal or in writing.
       4.1.3.2. Counsel for the Accused. The accused is entitled to be represented by military defense
       counsel certified under Article 27(b) and sworn under Article 42(a), UCMJ. RCM 405(d)(2). The
       accused may also be represented by civilian defense counsel; however, civilian defense counsel
       must be provided at no expense to the government. RCM 405(d)(2)(C). Civilian defense counsel
       must take an oath to perform his or her duties faithfully when representing an accused. The IO will
       administer this oath. The accused may represent himself, but this right is not absolute. United
       States v. Bramel, 29 M.J. 958 (A.C.M.R.), aff’d, 32 M.J. 3 (C.M.A. 1990).
   4.1.4. Delays and Resulting Speedy Trial Issues. The convening authority may approve a delay of
   the Article 32 investigation submitted by either party. The period of time of such delay shall be
   excluded when determining whether the period in RCM 707(a) has run. Prior to referral, the conven-
   ing authority may delegate the authority to grant continuances to an Article 32 investigating officer.
44                                                            AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


     See RCM 707(a)(1) Discussion. Thus, when an IO has been delegated authority to grant delays, the
     period covered by the delay is excludable from the 120-day period under RCM 707(9)(c). See also
     United States v. Lazauskas, 62 M.J. 472 (2005).
     4.1.5. Preliminary actions by the IO. The IO is responsible for an inquiry into the truth of the mat-
     ter set forth in the charge(s), consideration of the form of the charge(s), and a recommendation for a
     disposition that takes into account the interests of justice and discipline. Therefore, the IO must review
     the charge sheet. The IO should also review the evidence which forms the basis for the charge(s), and
     any other documents attached to the IO Appointment Letter. The IO reviews the evidence to ascertain
     whether it will be necessary to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation. The IO may also con-
     tact the government representative, if any, and the defense counsel to discuss administrative matters,
     including setting the date and time for the formal hearing.
     4.1.6. Witnesses.
        4.1.6.1. Availability of Witnesses. The IO must determine whether witnesses are reasonably
        available. The “100 miles of the situs” rule found in RCM 405(g)(1)(A) is not a per se rule of
        unavailability. The IO must conduct a balancing test to determine reasonable availability. RCM
        405(g), Discussion.
        4.1.6.2. Arranging for Witnesses. If the IO considers a witness available, the IO requests the
        witness’ presence. Although the IO may contact witnesses to arrange for their presence at the Arti-
        cle 32 investigation, the IO may not discuss the substance of their testimony. The IO may delegate
        to the government representative the responsibility to arrange for the presence of witnesses the IO
        considers reasonably available.
            4.1.6.2.1. Military Witnesses. The IO arranges for the presence of military witnesses directly
            or through the witness’ commander. Before the commander determines a military witness is
            not reasonably available, the commander should consider the balancing test factors in RCM
            405(g), Discussion, and provide the reasons for his decision to the IO, to be included in the IO
            report. If the commander does not put the reasons in writing, the IO must make a memoran-
            dum for record detailing the commander’s reasons and include it in the report.
            4.1.6.2.2. Civilian Witnesses. The IO may invite civilian witnesses to attend. The IO does
            not have subpoena power. Therefore, if the witness refuses to testify, the witness is not reason-
            ably available.
     4.1.7. Conducting the Investigation.
        4.1.7.1. At the beginning of the investigation, the IO must inform the accused of the matters in
        RCM 405(f) and listed on the DD Form 457, Investigating Officer’s Report, Item 10.
        4.1.7.2. IOs should consider all testimony and evidence that is relevant, not cumulative, and rea-
        sonably available. RCM 405(g)(1). IOs must become familiar with the rules on alternatives to tes-
        timony and evidence in RCM 405(g)(4) and (5). See RCM 405(g)(1)(B) and 405(i) (applying
        MREs to Article 32 investigations).
            4.1.7.2.1. Procedure for Taking Testimony. All testimony, except that of the accused, is
            required to be taken under oath. RCM 405(h)(1)(A), Discussion. The accused may make a
            sworn or unsworn statement. The IO has discretion over the manner in which testimony is
            taken. The IO may personally question witnesses and/or allow the government representative
            to conduct the questioning. The IO must allow the defense counsel to question witnesses and
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                                            45


         should allow the defense wide latitude in cross-examination. Keep in mind the application of
         MRE 303, prohibiting degrading questions, and MRE 412, prohibiting questions regarding the
         alleged victim’s past sexual behavior or any perceived predisposition. An IO who suspects a
         witness of an offense should advise the witness of his or her rights under Article 31, UCMJ.
         4.1.7.2.2. Reducing Testimony to Writing. The IO is responsible for including all testimony
         in the report. Summarized testimony should be written in the first person. The witnesses
         should sign and swear to the truth of their summarized testimony, unless this would unduly
         delay completion of the investigation. If the witness reviews and signs the summarized testi-
         mony in the United States, use this language above the witness’ signature block: “I declare
         under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date).” If outside
         the United States, use: “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States
         of America that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date).” 28 U.S.C. §1746. The
         IO need not be present for a witness to sign their summarized testimony. If the witness is not
         available to sign their summarized testimony, the IO may swear that the summary is accurate.
     4.1.7.3. Reports of Investigation (ROI). AFOSI and Security Forces ROIs contain documents
     that are evidence, alternatives to evidence or alternatives to testimony. RCM 405(g)(4),(5). For

     405(g)(4)(A)(i),(B)(i). The narrative portion of an ROI is usually an “unsworn statement describ-
     ing the evidence” as that term is used in RCM 405(g)(5)(A)(v). Also, photographs or photocopies
     of physical evidence in ROIs are usually unauthenticated copies, photographs or reproduction of
     similar accuracy of the evidence. RCM 405(g)(5)(A)(ii) and (B)(ii). IOs are discouraged from
     considering ROIs in their entirety. In order to consider an ROI, IOs must look at each part of the
     ROI and determine whether it is evidence or an alternative to testimony. If so, the IO must also
     determine whether the witness or evidence is reasonably available and apply the rules in RCM
     405(g)(4) and (5). The IO should note in the report what parts of the ROI were considered and
     why. An investigator familiar with the matters in the ROI may testify over defense objection about
     both unavailable evidence and his or her participation in the investigation, including relating hear-
     say. RCM 404(g)(5)(B)(i). Witnesses whose statements appear in the ROI may adopt their state-
     ments as part of their testimony.
     4.1.7.4. Accused’s Statements. An accused is not considered a witness for purposes of RCM
     405. Therefore, a witness may testify about statements the accused made to the witness if relevant,
     not cumulative and not otherwise prohibited by RCM 405(i). Similarly, a written statement by the
     accused is evidence.
     4.1.7.5. Argument. Because an accused may present anything in defense, extenuation and miti-
     gation, and make a statement in any form, the IO may allow the accused or counsel, on behalf of
     the accused, to make a brief argument, if requested. RCM 405(f)(11),(12).
     4.1.7.6. Objections (RCM 405(h)(2)).
         4.1.7.6.1. The following are potential bases for objections:
              4.1.7.6.1.1. Violations of MRE 301 - 303, 305, 412 and Section V.
              4.1.7.6.1.2. Failure to comply with the procedural requirements of RCM 405.
              4.1.7.6.1.3. A determination that a witness or evidence is not reasonably available. RCM
              405(g)(2)(D).
46                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


            4.1.7.6.2. IOs are required to note objections in their reports. RCM 405(h)(2). The IO may
            require counsel to put objections in writing before noting them in the report. The IO may also
            set a time limit for filing objections.
     4.1.8. Tape Recordings and Verbatim Transcripts. Tape recordings of witness testimony and any
     verbatim transcripts at an Article 32 investigation are permitted only with the advance written
     approval of the SJA for the convening authority that directed the investigation. When considering
     such requests, SJAs should consider the likelihood the witness will be unavailable or refuse to testify
     at a later trial, whether the testimony of an important witness is best evaluated by reviewing the verba-
     tim testimony, and the discovery interest of the accused. If approved, all tape recordings or steno-
     graphic notes, which could be subject to release under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500, or RCM 914,
     must be retained until the case is completed.
     4.1.9. Open Proceedings. Ordinarily, Article 32 investigations are open to the public. All efforts to
     keep the investigation open should be explored before closing the investigation.
        4.1.9.1. Closing. Access by spectators to all or part of the proceeding may be restricted or fore-
        closed at the discretion of the convening authority that directed the investigation or the IO when
        warranted by the particular circumstances. RCM 405(h)(3). The convening authority directing the
        investigation may retain sole authority over a decision to open or close an Article 32 investigation
        by giving the IO procedural instructions at the time of appointment or at any time thereafter. RCM
        405(c).
            4.1.9.1.1. Specific Reasons. If the hearing is closed, the convening authority or IO ordering it
            closed should articulate specific, substantial reasons, in writing, for closure. These reasons
            should be attached to the IO’s report of investigation. Such reasons ordinarily will be only
            those circumstances under which a court-martial may be closed. MRE 412(c) (evidence of a
            victim’s prior sexual conduct); MRE 505(i) and (j) (classified information); MRE 506(i) (gov-
            ernment privilege). RCM 405(h)(3), Discussion. Make every effort to close only those por-
            tions of the investigation that are clearly justified and keep the remaining portions of the
            investigation open.
            4.1.9.1.2. Reopening a Closed Investigation. A convening authority may open an Article 32
            investigation an IO has closed. Prior to issuing procedural instructions to reopen an investiga-
            tion, the convening authority must consider the IO’s written reasons for closing the investiga-
            tion.
        4.1.9.2. Potential Witnesses. It is within the IO’s discretion to exclude potential witnesses.
     4.1.10. Media. See Section 13D for issues dealing with the news media.
     4.1.11. Investigating Uncharged Misconduct. If evidence received at an Article 32 investigation
     indicates the accused committed uncharged misconduct, the IO may investigate the subject matter of
     such offense and make a recommendation as to its disposition prior to preferral of charges on that
     offense. The IO should ensure the accused is present at the investigation, is informed of the nature of
     each uncharged offense investigated, and is afforded the right to counsel, cross-examination and pre-
     sentation of evidence. If the uncharged misconduct is subsequently charged, consult RCM 405(b) as
     to the need for further investigation. Article 32(d), UCMJ.
     4.1.12. Drafting the IO’s Report of Investigation. The IO prepares a report using DD Form 457,
     Investigating Officer’s Report, with supplemental pages, if necessary. See RCM 405(j)(2) and MCM,
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                     47


  Appendix 5, for what must be included in the IO report. The report must clearly state what evidence
  the IO considered. The standard of proof is whether reasonable grounds exist to believe that the
  accused committed the offense(s) alleged, not whether the government has presented a prima facie
  case. RCM 405(j)(2)(H); DD Form 457, Item 18. Reasonable grounds exist when the evidence con-
  vinces a reasonable, prudent person there is probable cause to believe a crime was committed and the
  accused committed it. A finding that reasonable grounds exist does not require a recommendation of
  trial by court-martial.
  4.1.13. Assembly of the IO Report.
     4.1.13.1. The IO report is the first indorsement to the IO Appointment Letter.
     4.1.13.2. The IO report includes the DD Form 457, its supplemental pages, and exhibits. Exhibits
     include the charge sheet, summarized or verbatim testimony, and other evidence, whether or not
     considered.
  4.1.14. Distribution of the Report.
     4.1.14.1. The IO should deliver the report through the convening authority’s SJA to the conven-
     ing authority who directed the Article 32 investigation. The SJA makes photocopies of the report
     and delivers the report to the convening authority. The process should be described in the IO
     Appointment Letter. RCM 405(j)(3).
     4.1.14.2. The convening authority that directed the investigation, or the SJA on behalf of the con-
     vening authority, shall promptly cause a copy of the report to be served on both the accused and
     accused's counsel. RCM 405(j)(3). Upon delivery, the accused and the accused’s counsel shall
     sign receipts of service, showing the date and time of service. Append the receipts as attachments
     to the IO Appointment Letter.
  4.1.15. Objections to the IO Report. Any objections to the report must be submitted to the conven-
  ing authority that directed the investigation within 5 days of receipt of the report by the accused and
  counsel, whichever is later. The day the report is delivered is not counted in calculating the 5-day
  period. RCM 103(9); 405(j)(4). The convening authority, upon receipt, may direct the investigation be
  reopened or take other action, as appropriate. However, this does not prohibit a convening authority
  from referring charges to trial or taking other action within the 5-day period. RCM 405(j)(4).
     4.1.15.1. If timely objections are received after the convening authority has taken action on the
     report, the convening authority may reconsider the prior action taken in light of the objections
     received. If the report has been forwarded to a superior court-martial convening authority for dis-
     position in accordance with paragraph 4.1.16. below, forward the objections to that convening
     authority by the most expeditious means so that the objections may receive appropriate consider-
     ation.
     4.1.15.2. Objections not received in a timely manner are waived. However, relief from the waiver
     may be granted for good cause shown. RCM 405(k).
     4.1.15.3. Append objections as attachments to the IO Appointment Letter.
  4.1.16. Forwarding the Article 32 Report of Investigation to a Superior Convening Authority.
  If the convening authority who directed the investigation decides to forward the Article 32 report to a
  superior court-martial convening authority for disposition, the convening authority who directed the
  investigation prepares a forwarding letter which includes a recommendation for disposition of the
48                                                            AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


     charges. This letter is forwarded to the superior court-martial convening authority, through the supe-
     rior convening authority’s SJA, and must include the following documents as attachments:
        4.1.16.1. The Charge Sheet,
        4.1.16.2. The commander’s indorsement to the charge sheet, and
        4.1.16.3. The IO Appointment Letter with attachments (including the IO Report, accused and
        defense counsel receipts and any objections).
     4.1.17. If the superior convening authority needs to detail members to a court-martial to try the case,
     forward a list of court member nominees with Credit data. United States v. Credit, 2 M.J. 631
     (A.F.C.M.R. 1976); RCM 912. A list of court member nominees may not be required if the case will
     ultimately be referred to a court-martial previously impaneled to try cases (i.e., a standing panel to try
     cases that may arise in a specified period).

Section 4B—Courts of Inquiry

4.2. Courts of Inquiry. (Article 135, UCMJ; MCM, Part I, Para. 2(b)(3)).
     4.2.1. General. A court of inquiry is one of several investigative methods available to ascertain the
     facts of a matter of importance to the Air Force. Only a GCMCA may convene a court of inquiry. Do
     not use a court of inquiry when statute or regulation otherwise provides specific investigative proce-
     dures for a matter. Do not use a court of inquiry in place of an Article 32 investigation, unless deemed
     necessary to produce evidence not otherwise reasonably available. If, however, a court of inquiry pre-
     viously investigated the subject matter of an offense, and the requirements of RCM 405(b) are met, an
     Article 32 investigation may not be necessary.
     4.2.2. Members of the Court of Inquiry. A court of inquiry shall consist of three or more commis-
     sioned officers. The senior member is the president. All members should be senior to any person
     whose conduct is the subject of an inquiry.
     4.2.3. Counsel for the Court of Inquiry. The convening authority appoints a judge advocate certi-
     fied under Article 27(b), UCMJ, as legal advisor for the court of inquiry. The counsel assists the court
     of inquiry in matters of law, presenting evidence and keeping the record.
     4.2.4. Party to the Court of Inquiry. Designate any person subject to the UCMJ whose conduct is
     subject to inquiry as a party to the court of inquiry. Any person designated as a party shall be given
     due notice and has the right to be present, to be represented by counsel, to cross-examine witnesses
     and to introduce evidence.
     4.2.5. Counsel for Parties. A party to the court of inquiry is entitled to representation by a defense
     counsel certified under Article 27(b), UCMJ. A party may request individual military defense counsel,
     subject to the rules of reasonable availability applicable to trials by courts-martial. Any party may
     retain a civilian counsel at no expense to the government. See paragraph 5.3.
     4.2.6. Convening Order. Use the sample format in Figure 4.2. to convene a court of inquiry. The
     order appoints the members and counsel for the court of inquiry, states the subject of inquiry, desig-
     nates known parties, and directs a report of findings of facts on the issues involved. If the convening
     authority desires conclusions and recommendations, include in the order. The convening order should
     set the time and place of the court of inquiry. The convening order is provided to the parties and coun-
     sel.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                       49


   4.2.7. Reporters. A qualified court reporter records the proceedings and testimony, and prepares a
   record of the proceedings for authentication by the president. If the record of the proceedings is to be
   used as a substitute for an Article 32 investigation, it must comply with the requirements of RCM
   405(j). See also AFMAN 51-203, paragraph 16.12.5.
   4.2.8. Challenges. Members of a court of inquiry may be challenged by a party but only for cause
   stated to the court. The president of the court, with advice from the counsel for the court of inquiry,
   rules on challenges.
   4.2.9. Oaths. The members, counsel, reporter and interpreter take an oath or affirmation to faithfully
   perform their duties. Article 135(e), UCMJ. The president or counsel for the court of inquiry may
   administer oaths. Article 136, UCMJ.
   4.2.10. Procedures and Rules of Evidence. The rules of evidence and procedure that apply to an
   Article 32 investigation apply to a court of inquiry.
   4.2.11. Witnesses. The president of the court may issue subpoenas for civilian witnesses. RCM
   703(e)(2)(C). All witnesses testifying before a court of inquiry do so under oath or affirmation. Mem-
   bers of the court of inquiry, the counsel to the court of inquiry and the counsel to a party may examine
   all witnesses. A party cannot be compelled to testify, but may testify under oath subject to cross-exam-
   ination or make an unsworn statement.
   4.2.12. Written Report by the Court of Inquiry. The court of inquiry makes findings of fact, but
   may not make conclusions and recommendations, unless required to do so by the convening authority.
   Dissenting views are authorized.
   4.2.13. Record of the Court of Inquiry. Each court shall keep a record of its proceedings. Authenti-
   cate the record in accordance with Article 135(h), UCMJ. The president forwards the authenticated
   record to the convening authority, who obtains a legal review from the servicing SJA. The legal
   review includes a summary of the proceedings, a determination of the legal sufficiency of the proceed-
   ings, and a recommended action.
   4.2.14. Revision. The convening authority may reconvene the court of inquiry and direct it to take
   additional action the convening authority deems necessary.

Section 4C—Depositions (RCM 702)

4.3. Counsel. The rules governing qualification of counsel who may perform duties before courts-martial
apply to counsel representing the parties at a deposition. The deposition should affirmatively indicate the
qualifications of counsel. See Figure 4.3.

4.4. Recording and Authentication.
   4.4.1. Written Depositions. Record and authenticate depositions taken on written interrogatories
   using a DD Form 456, Interrogatories and Depositions. Do not use the DD Form 456 for oral deposi-
   tions.
   4.4.2. Oral Deposition. Conduct oral depositions in accordance with the procedures in RCM
   702(g)(1). Figure 4.4. provides a sample format for conducting and transcribing the proceeding.
   Record and transcribe oral depositions verbatim, noting the times and dates of the opening, closing,
50                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


     recesses and adjournment. An oral deposition may be recorded by a reporter or other means, including
     videotape. RCM 702(g)(3). The deposition officer is the custodian for the record of deposition.
        4.4.2.1. If the deposition is recorded, the transcriber shall certify the transcription is true and
        accurate. See Figure 4.5. The deposition officer must authenticate the record of deposition. See
        Figure 4.6. The certification and authentication shall be the last pages of the deposition.
        4.4.2.2. For depositions recorded by other means, a written transcript is not required unless the
        convening authority or military judge directs one. RCM 702(g)(3). However, the record of deposi-
        tion, whether it is a videotape, audiotape or sound film, must still be authenticated by the deposi-
        tion officer. The authentication is attached to the recording. A sample format for the authentication
        of a videotaped deposition is at Figure 4.7.

Section 4D—Referral and Disposition

4.5. Pretrial Advice (Article 34, UCMJ; RCM 406).
     4.5.1. SJA's Advice. A person other than the SJA may prepare the advice, but the SJA is, unless dis-
     qualified, responsible for it and must personally sign it. An assistant performing the duties of the SJA,
     in the absence of, or because of the disqualification of the SJA, signs in the capacity of "Acting Staff
     Judge Advocate." The SJA's advice is required for all GCMs and is optional for SPCMs and SCMs.
     4.5.2. Mandatory Contents. The pretrial advice must include the conclusions and recommendation
     enumerated in RCM 406(b). The pretrial advice must also address the following matters, when appli-
     cable:
        4.5.2.1. Capital Cases. In a case referred as capital, the pretrial advice must specify the aggravat-
        ing circumstances relied upon and provide the convening authority with conclusions as to whether
        capital referral is warranted based on the analysis as set forth in RCM 1004(b)(4). In a case where
        the death penalty is authorized, but not mandatory, and the convening authority decides to refer the
        case as noncapital, the referral should include special instructions stating the case is referred as
        noncapital. RCM 201(f)(1)(A)(iii).
        4.5.2.2. Offenders with Outstanding Combat or Overseas Record. When a member with an
        outstanding combat or overseas record is alleged to have committed an offense punishable under
        the UCMJ, a commander should give appropriate consideration to that military record before
        determining what, if any, disciplinary action to take. When a case is under consideration for refer-
        ral to a GCM, include information about the accused's outstanding combat or overseas record in
        the SJA's advice. Failure to include such information in the advice is not a prejudicial error.
     4.5.3. Format and Length. Pretrial advice need not contain any underlying analysis or rationale for
     the conclusions contained in it. In addition, lengthy summaries of evidence, detailed explanations of
     elements of offenses, and extensive discussions of possible defenses are not required. See sample for-
     mat for pretrial advice at Figure 4.8.

4.6. Forwarding of Pretrial Advice. The charge sheet, the commander’s indorsement, forwarding let-
ters or other indorsements, and, if applicable, the investigating officer’s appointment letter with attach-
ments (including the report of investigation, receipts of report and any objections) should be forwarded
with the pretrial advice to the convening authority. If the Article 32 investigation is waived, forward the
accused’s waiver. If an Article 32 investigation is not conducted, forward the documentary evidence that
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                           51


the SJA relied upon to conclude the charges and specifications are warranted, such as investigative
reports, witness statements and other documents containing relevant information. If the convening author-
ity needs to detail members to a court-martial to try the forwarded case, forward appropriate documenta-
tion for court-member selection. See paragraph 4.1.17.

4.7. Referral of Charges to Courts-Martial (RCM 601). The convening authority must sign either the
referral section on the DD Form 458, Charge Sheet, or another document reflecting the intention to refer
charges to trial. Such other documents may include concurrence with an SJA's pretrial advice recommen-
dation to refer the case to trial by a specified court-martial.
   4.7.1. Completing the Referral Block on Charge Sheet. The designation of the convening author-
   ity on the charge sheet should be the same as on the convening order. Use the date the convening
   authority referred the charges. If the convening authority personally signs the referral, strike out "by ...
   Command or Order … of...," and include the convening authority's signature block. If the convening
   authority delegated authority to sign the referral block on the charge sheet to a judge advocate, the
   judge advocate signs the referral “FOR THE COMMANDER.”
       4.7.1.1. Include special instructions in the referral block when appropriate. RCM 601(e). For
       example, when additional charges are referred, include the following: "To be tried with the origi-
       nal (charge) (charges), dated ______ [date of preferral of original charge(s)]." Also, when a capital
       case is referred as noncapital, include the following: “To be tried as a noncapital case.”
       4.7.1.2. The SPCMCA SJA must have the accused’s records examined to ascertain the accused’s
       nationality no later than twenty four hours after referral, even if a claim of foreign nationality has
       not been made. See paragraph 13.10.3. Comply with the reporting requirements of paragraph
       13.10.1.
   4.7.2. Dismissing Charges (RCM 401(c)(1)). If the convening authority determines some of the
   charges and/or specifications will be dismissed instead of referred to court-martial, the dismissed
   charges and/or specifications should be lined out, and the dismissal dated and initialed (e.g., “Dis-
   missed on 15 Sep 02, [initials]”). This may be accomplished by the convening authority, a judge advo-
   cate authorized to sign referrals on the convening authority's behalf, or the trial counsel at the
   direction of the convening authority. The remaining charges should be renumbered if necessary. If no
   charges remain, the referral must be withdrawn. See paragraph 8.2.
   4.7.3. Disqualification of Convening Authority (RCM 601(c)). An accuser may not refer charges
   to a general or special court-martial. Further, a convening authority is disqualified if he or she has "an
   interest other than an official interest in the prosecution of the accused." Article 1(9), UCMJ.
       4.7.3.1. If the SPCMCA is disqualified, forward the case to the GCMCA. If the GCMCA is dis-
       qualified, the MAJCOM commander determines who shall act as the GCMCA. If there is not an
       appropriate commander exercising GCMCA within the command, the MAJCOM SJA requests
       AFLOA/JAJM assistance in the designation of a commander to serve as the GCMCA.

4.8. Withdrawing Referred Charges (RCM 604). Reference paragraph 8.2. for withdrawing referred
charges.
52                                                             AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


4.9. Re-referring Charges. After charges have been referred to trial, it may become necessary to refer
them again on the same charge sheet. Use the following procedures for re-referring charges in rehearings
and other cases, including withdrawn charges:
     4.9.1. New Referral. The new referral must be documented in the same format as that on page 2 of
     the charge sheet, following the rules in paragraph 4.7. The new referral may be accomplished by typ-
     ing the appropriate language on bond paper or by using the referral section from page 2 of another DD
     Form 458. When completed, cut out and attach the new referral section to the charge sheet by stapling
     it immediately above the original referral section. Never remove or obliterate a prior referral. If a third
     or subsequent referral is necessary, attach it in the same way as the second.
     4.9.2. Special Instructions for Rehearings. When a case has been referred for a rehearing (whether
     in full, for a limited purpose, or for a new trial), incorporate the appropriate instructions in the referral
     section. RCM 810. For example, in a rehearing on sentence only, include the special instruction: "For
     a rehearing on sentence only, as ordered by General Court-Martial Order No. 17, Headquarters, 15 AF,
     dated 4 June 2007, as to the charge and specification of which the accused was found guilty and
     affirmed by the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeal's decision, dated 10 May 2007," or a similar
     instruction.

4.10. Notification of Referral of Later Charges in Pending Cases.
     4.10.1. Notify AFLOA/JAJM. If charges are referred to trial against a person who is the accused in
     a case under review under Articles 66, 67, 67a or 69, UCMJ, the headquarters referring the new
     charges to trial must notify AFLOA/JAJM by the most expeditious means available (e.g., facsimile or
     e-mail). Identify the case currently under review by providing the accused’s full name, rank, and
     social security number, along with the case’s ACM (the number assigned by JAJM Appellate
     Records), if available. Also provide the nature of the new charges, including the date referred, type of
     court-martial, anticipated date of trial, a brief statement of facts of the case, and any other information
     which might affect disposition of the current review concerning the case.
     4.10.2. Follow-Up Messages. Send follow-up messages to advise when trial is completed (including
     the result), if the charges are withdrawn, or if there are other significant developments which may
     affect disposition of the case currently under review.

4.11. Arraignment and Pleas at 39(a) Session. When a UCMJ, Article 39(a) session is conducted by
the military judge before assembly, the arraignment may be held and the plea of the accused may be
accepted at that time by the military judge. In addition, the military judge may enter findings of guilty on
an accepted plea of guilty at that time.

4.12. Docketing. USAF/JAT shall establish docketing procedures.

MEMORANDUM FOR ______/CC


FROM: ______/JA


SUBJECT: Pretrial Advice – United States v. Rank and Name, (SSN), Unit and Base


1. The accused is charged with three specifications of making 19 worthless checks with the intent to
defraud, in violation of Article 123a, UCMJ. (The charge was preferred on 15 May 2007, investigated
under Article 32, UCMJ, on 16 and 17 May 2007, and forwarded by the investigating officer on 22 May
2007 with a recommendation for referral to trial by general court-martial.) OR (The charge was preferred
on 15 May 2007. On 25 May 2007, the accused submitted a waiver to his/her right to an investigation
under Article 32, UCMJ.) The commander (SPCMCA) forwarded the charge on 2 June 2007 with a rec-
ommendation for trial by general court-martial.


2. Pursuant to Rule for Court-Martial 406 and Article 34, UCMJ, I provide you the following advice:


       a. The charge and specifications are generally in proper form. [If applicable, add the following for
minor amendments: A minor amendment to specification 2 should be made:


       The specification should be amended at check 147 to reflect, “pay to the order of AFO-147,” vice
       “Air Force Commissary.”]


     b. The charge and specifications [if applicable, insert: , “as amended,”] (allege offenses under the
UCMJ).


        c. The charge and specifications are warranted by the evidence contained in the [(Article 32
report) (documents listed below as attachments)].


       d. The accused is on active duty in the United States Air Force. I am satisfied a court-martial
would have jurisdiction over the accused and the offenses charged.


            [NOTE: If applicable, include information on an accused’s outstanding combat or overseas
           record and, in capital cases, address aggravating circumstances. See paragraph 4.5.2.]

        Attach written or message orders, if any, to the ROT.
        5.3.1.6. RCM 503(c)(3) and other Armed Forces’ regulations govern detailing counsel from other
        Armed Forces to Air Force courts-martial.
        5.3.1.7. The Chief, Military Justice Division (AFLOA/JAJM), is TJAG’s designee with authority
        to make Air Force counsel, with the exception of those assigned to AFLOA/JAJA, available for
        detail to trials convened by another Armed Force. AFLOA/JAJA exercises this authority over
        ADCs and SDCs.
     5.3.2. Qualifications.
        5.3.2.1. General Court-Martial. Attorneys detailed as trial counsel, defense counsel, or associ-
        ate defense counsel for a GCM must be certified according to Article 27(b), UCMJ. Any person
        detailed as assistant trial counsel or assistant defense counsel must be designated as a judge advo-
        cate under 10 U.S.C. § 8067(g) and AFI 51-103, Designation and Certification of Judge Advo-
        cates.
        5.3.2.2. Special Court-Martial. Attorneys detailed as defense counsel for a SPCM must be cer-
        tified according to Article 27(b), UCMJ. Any person detailed as trial counsel, assistant trial coun-
        sel, or assistant defense counsel for a SPCM must be designated as a judge advocate under 10
        U.S.C. § 8067(g) and AFI 51-103.
            5.3.2.2.1. If, because of physical conditions or military exigencies, an accused is not afforded
            the opportunity to be represented by defense counsel certified according to Article 27(b),
            UCMJ, the convening authority must make a detailed written statement, to be included in the
            ROT, stating why counsel with such qualifications could not be obtained. Article 27(c)(1),
            UCMJ.
        5.3.2.3. Summary Court-Martial. An accused facing trial by SCM may request representation
        by a military defense counsel but is not entitled to military defense counsel certified according to
        Article 27(b), UCMJ. RCM 1301(e). An attorney who has been designated a judge advocate under
        10 U.S.C. § 8067(g) and AFI 51-103 may be detailed to represent the Government.
        5.3.2.4. Air Force Reserve Members. The requirements of certification and designation set out
        in 5.3.2.1. through 5.3.2.3. apply to reserve judge advocates. Only those reservists assigned as
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                        65


       senior trial or senior defense counsel may be certified annually. Other reserve judge advocates are
       certified according to AFI 51-103.
       5.3.2.5. Civilian Counsel (RCM 502(d)(3)). When a civilian counsel represents an accused at a
       court-martial, include the counsel's qualifications to serve as defense counsel on the record.
       Include information about the civilian counsel's bar membership and standing.
   5.3.3. Disqualifications (Articles 26(d) and 27(a), UCMJ; RCM 502(d)(4)). An IO for an Article
   32, UCMJ, investigation may never serve as a member of the prosecution or as military judge in the
   same case. A judge advocate who served as the accuser or IO for the Article 32, UCMJ, investigation
   cannot perform any other duty in connection with the trial of the same case, except as defense counsel
   at the specific request of an accused after being fully informed of the individual’s prior involvement in
   the case.

5.4. Requests for Individual Military Defense Counsel (RCM 502(d)(3) and 506(b)). A n a c c u s e d
may request representation by an individual military defense counsel (IMDC) in an Article 32 investiga-
tion or at a court-martial. The requested counsel represents the accused, if reasonably available. The right
to request an IMDC does not extend to representation for actions under Article 15, UCMJ.
   5.4.1. Format of IMDC Requests. An IMDC request must be in writing and signed by the accused
   or detailed counsel and shall include the following, as applicable:
       5.4.1.1. The date of the Article 32 investigation or trial;
       5.4.1.2. Any special qualifications of the requested counsel relevant to the case;
       5.4.1.3. Whether the accused is represented by other counsel (not the requested counsel) and, if
       so, the name of that counsel;
       5.4.1.4. Whether the accused has entered into an attorney-client relationship with the requested
       counsel concerning the charges being investigated or tried, (including any statement required by
       5.4.4.);
       5.4.1.5. In the case of a requested counsel presently unavailable, whether the counsel is expected
       to be available before the Article 32 investigation or trial; and,
       5.4.1.6. A statement acknowledging the accused's understanding that, if the IMDC request is
       granted, the detailed defense counsel may be excused from further participation in the case at the
       sole discretion of the detailing authority.
   5.4.2. Non-Availability of Certain Counsel. In addition to those persons listed in RCM 506(b)(1),
   the following persons are not ordinarily reasonably available to serve as IMDC because of the nature
   of their duties, positions, or geographic locations:
       5.4.2.1. Medical Legal Consultants and Advisors;
       5.4.2.2. Attorneys in the National Capital Region assigned to the Air Force Legal Operations
       Agency, excluding any individual detailed to perform duties as a SDC or ADC;
       5.4.2.3. Attorneys attending an Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) sponsored program
       such as an LL.M (Master of Laws) program;
       5.4.2.4. Attorneys assigned or attached to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI);
66                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


        5.4.2.5. Attorneys detailed to perform duties as a STC. Detailed trial and assistant trial counsel in
        the same or an allied case;
        5.4.2.6. Staff Judge Advocates, and for commands having a general court-martial convening
        authority, Deputy Staff Judge Advocates.
     5.4.3. Reasonably Available. A counsel is "reasonably available" if not considered unavailable by
     the terms of the MCM or this instruction, and the appropriate approval authority determines the
     requested counsel can perform the duties of IMDC without unreasonable expense or detriment to the
     United States and without unreasonable delay in the proceedings. In determining the reasonable avail-
     ability of a counsel, the approval authority may consider the following:
        5.4.3.1. The duties, workload, and assignment status of the requested counsel;
        5.4.3.2. The experience level, duties, and workload of the military counsel already detailed to rep-
        resent the accused;
        5.4.3.3. The nature and complexity of the charges and legal issues involved in the case;
        5.4.3.4. Whether a certified assistant trial counsel is detailed to the case;
        5.4.3.5. The workload of the office to which the requested counsel is assigned and the availability
        of personnel to meet those demands;
        5.4.3.6. The distance from the expected site of the proceedings; and
        5.4.3.7. Whether requested counsel is likely to be a necessary witness at trial or is otherwise con-
        flicted from representing the accused under the Air Force Rules of Professional Conduct or Air
        Force Standards for Criminal Justice.
     5.4.4. Exception: Attorney-Client Relationship. When an attorney-client relationship exists, as
     determined by the approval authority, exceptions to non-availability based upon assignment to a posi-
     tion identified in RCM 506(b)(1) and paragraph 5.4.2. should ordinarily be granted. An attorney-cli-
     ent relationship exists when, at the time of the accused’s IMDC request, the accused and the requested
     attorney had a bilateral understanding as to the nature of services to be provided in the case, and the
     requested attorney was actively engaged in the preparation and pretrial strategy of the case. United
     States v. Spriggs, 52 M.J. 235 (2000). A statement claiming the attorney-client relationship signed by
     the requested attorney and accused must accompany the IMDC request (see paragraph 5.4.1.4.). The
     statement must provide an overview of the relationship.
     5.4.5. IMDC Requests for Air Reserve Component (ARC) Attorneys. Only ARC attorneys on
     extended Title 10 active duty tours can be requested. The reasonable availability of ARC attorneys is
     assessed in the context of RCM 506(b)(1) and paragraph 5.4.2.; i.e., the restrictions apply to the active
     and reserve components alike. ARC attorneys must be in Title 10 status at all times when performing
     as an IMDC. Requests for ARC attorneys are processed IAW paragraph 5.4.7.
     5.4.6. Processing IMDC Requests for ADCs and SDCs.
        5.4.6.1. IMDC requests for ADCs and SDCs are forwarded through defense channels to the
        appropriate approval authority as follows:
            5.4.6.1.1. Senior Defense Counsels (SDCs) determine the availability of and take action on
            IMDC requests for ADCs assigned to them. However, a Deputy Chief, Trial Defense Division,
            may override a SDC’s decision to grant an IMDC request.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                      67


         5.4.6.1.2. The Chief, or a Deputy Chief, Trial Defense Division, determines the availability of
         SDCs and takes action on IMDC requests for SDCs. However, the Chief, Trial Defense Divi-
         sion, may override a Deputy Chief’s decision to grant an IMDC request.
         5.4.6.1.3. The Chief, Trial Defense Division, determines the availability of a Deputy Chief,
         Trial Defense Division, and takes action on IMDC requests for the Deputy Chief.
     5.4.6.2. An accused may appeal the disapproval of an IMDC request to the Chief, Trial Defense
     Division, whose decision is final. There is no appeal from an IMDC request initially disapproved
     by the Chief, Trial Defense Division.
  5.4.7. Processing IMDC Requests for Other Counsel. IMDC requests for all other counsel (not
  addressed in paragraph 5.4.6.) are forwarded to the convening authority through the trial counsel, if
  any. RCM 506(b)(2). Because the Trial Defense Division is responsible for defense services through-
  out the Air Force, it is incumbent upon those IMDCs who are not assigned to JAJD to notify the Chief,
  Trial Defense Division, of their association with a case as soon as practicable. These IMDCs should
  also keep the regional SDC informed about the progress of the case. Additionally, the IMDC must
  coordinate in advance any anticipated expenditure of JAJD funds for travel or other reasons.
     5.4.7.1. Disposition when Counsel is Not Reasonably Available. If the requested counsel is not
     reasonably available for a reason identified in RCM 506(b)(1) or paragraph 5.4.2., and the accused
     does not assert an attorney-client relationship, the convening authority denies the request and noti-
     fies the accused.
     5.4.7.2. Disposition when Counsel May Be Available. If the requested counsel appears to be
     reasonably available (i.e., not apparently unavailable IAW RCM 506(b)(1) or paragraph 5.4.2.),
     the convening authority forwards the request to the appropriate approving authority identified
     below. The approving authority evaluates availability (see paragraph 5.4.3.), decides whether to
     grant the request, and informs the forwarding convening authority of the decision and the reasons
     for the decision. The convening authority notifies the accused of the decision.
         5.4.7.2.1. Attorneys Assigned to AFLOA or HQ Air Force. Send requests for attorneys in
         the Civil Law and Litigation Directorate (AFLOA/JAC), Air Force Judiciary Directorate
         (AFLOA/JAJ), Legal Information Services Directorate (AFLOA/JAS), AFJAGS or HQ Air
         Force directorates to the respective director or division chief. Requests for ADCs and SDCs
         shall be forwarded in accordance with paragraph 5.4.6.
         5.4.7.2.2. LL.M. Students. Send requests for attorneys in an LL.M. program to the Director,
         Professional Development Division, HQ USAF/JAX.
         5.4.7.2.3. Staff Judge Advocates. Send requests for staff judge advocates to the SJA’s com-
         manding officer.
         5.4.7.2.4. All Others. Send requests for all other attorneys to the requested counsel's SJA,
         supervising officer, or commander.
  5.4.8. Appeals. The accused may request review of a disapproved IMDC request by the next higher
  level of supervision of the officer who denied the request. Appeals shall be forwarded to the conven-
  ing authority through the trial counsel.
     5.4.8.1. If the convening authority originally denied the request, and declines to grant the request
     on appeal, forward the appeal to the convening authority’s superior officer for review and deci-
68                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


        sion. The final decision is returned to the convening authority, who notifies the accused. There is
        no appeal from an IMDC request initially disapproved by a MAJCOM commander or higher
        authority.
        5.4.8.2. If an approval authority originally denied the request, the appeal is forwarded by the con-
        vening authority to that approval authority. If the approval authority declines to grant the request
        on appeal, he or she forwards the appeal to the approval authority’s superior officer for review and
        decision. The Deputy Judge Advocate General (DJAG) reviews denials by Directors of AFLOA/
        JAJ, AFLOA/JAC, AFLOA/JAS, AFJAGS or by HQ USAF directorate chiefs. There is no review
        of denials made by the Deputy Judge Advocate General. The final decision is returned to the con-
        vening authority, who notifies the accused of the decision.
        5.4.8.3. A military judge may, for good cause, determine that a particular IMDC is reasonably
        available, notwithstanding any provision of this instruction.

5.5. Oaths (Article 136, UCMJ; RCM 807).
     5.5.1. One-Time Oath. Military judges certified according to Article 26(b), UCMJ, military counsel,
     certified according to Article 27(b), UCMJ, and court reporters may take a one-time oath.
        5.5.1.1. Procedure for One-Time Oath. Any person authorized by Article 136, UCMJ, may
        administer the one-time oath. The person administering the oath completes a certificate indicating
        the place and date the oath was administered. The oath contains the typed name, signature, and
        qualifications of the person administering the oath. Give a copy to the person taking the oath.
            5.5.1.1.1. For military judges, send the original and one copy to HQ USAF/JAX. Use the fol-
            lowing oath: “I, (name of military judge), do (swear) (affirm) that I will faithfully and impar-
            tially perform the duties of military judge in any proceeding under the Uniform Code of
            Military Justice to which I am detailed to perform such duties, (so help me God).”
            5.5.1.1.2. For military counsel, send the original and one copy to HQ USAF/JAX. Use the fol-
            lowing oath: “I, [name of military counsel], do (swear) (affirm) that I will faithfully perform
            the duties of counsel in any proceeding under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to which I
            am detailed to perform such duties or in any court-martial in which I am to perform duties of
            individual defense counsel, (so help me God).”
            5.5.1.1.3. For court reporters, give the original to the reporter and file one copy in the office
            where the individual is assigned. If the individual transfers to another Air Force legal office,
            forward a copy of the oath to the receiving SJA. Use the following oath: “I, (name of reporter),
            do (swear) (affirm) that I will faithfully perform the duties of (reporter) in any proceeding
            under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to which I am detailed, (so help me God).”
     5.5.2. Court Members. Swear in court members for each court-martial to which they are detailed.
     The trial counsel administers the oath.
     5.5.3. Interpreters. In a GCM or SPCM, the trial counsel or military judge administers an oath to the
     interpreter. In other proceedings, a person authorized by Article 136, UCMJ, administers the oath
     (e.g., summary court-martial officer, deposition officer, investigating officer). The oath must be
     included in the record of the proceeding. An interpreter is properly sworn after an affirmative response
     to the following oath: “Do you, [name of interpreter], (swear) (affirm) that you will faithfully perform
     the duties of interpreter in this proceeding, (so help you God)?”
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                        69


5.6. Defense Investigative Support. Defense requests for investigative support will be made in writing
to the servicing SJA, who will forward the request along with a recommendation to the convening author-
ity. If the convening authority grants the request and investigative resources are available within the con-
vening authority’s command that would satisfy the needs of the defense, other than AFOSI investigators,
the convening authority appoints an investigator.
   5.6.1. If the convening authority concludes that appointment of an AFOSI special agent is necessary
   under the circumstances, the convening authority will inform the local AFOSI detachment com-
   mander. The AFOSI detachment commander will forward the request through command channels for
   a determination of whether or not investigative resources exist to support the defense request. If
   AFOSI/CC agrees that appointment of a special agent is appropriate and an agent is available, he or
   she will appoint one. The AFOSI/CC is the decision authority for appointment of AFOSI agents as
   defense investigators, except in the extraordinary case where a trial judge specifically mandates the
   appointment of an AFOSI special agent. In all cases, the convening authority will provide the funding
   IAW 51-201, Figure 6.8., Note 9. See United States v. Pomarleau, 57 MJ 351 (CMA 2002). Contact
   AFOSI/JA with any questions regarding this policy or its application including provisions that apply
   to the conduct of AFOSI special agents who have been assigned to provide defense investigative sup-
   port.

Section 5B—Court Reporters

5.7. General Information.
   5.7.1. Duties. The primary role of the Air Force court reporter is to report, transcribe, and assemble
   court-martial records, Article 32, UCMJ, investigations, and other proceedings, as required. The
   reporter is neutral and should not express personal opinions about the case being reported. Reporters
   are normally detailed to all Air Force GCMs and SPCMs. The reporter records everything that is said
   or done verbatim, from the initial Article 39(a) session until the court adjourns and maintains the
   reporter’s notes and recordings according to the Air Force Records Disposition Standards. As deter-
   mined by the SJA, reporters assist counsel for both sides, hearing officers, and the military judge in
   preparing and marking documents associated with proceedings under the UCMJ. Upon the prior
   approval of the military judge, court reporters may authenticate records of trial (ROT) in SPCMs,
   including acquittals, not involving a bad conduct discharge (BCD). When authenticating the ROT, use
   the page provided for in the DD Form 490, Record of Trial, package, delete the words "military judge"
   and substitute the words "court reporter."
   5.7.2. Detailing Court Reporters. The Air Force court reporter program is managed by the Superin-
   tendent, USAF Judiciary. Requests for support, other than expeditionary court reporting requirements
   and mishap investigation boards, will be sent directly from the requesting office to the Superintendent
   for assignment. Following assignment, SJAs detail court reporters to perform the functions specified
   in Article 28, UCMJ, and RCM 502(3)(b), and any other duties for which needed (RCM 501(c)).
   Requests for expeditionary court reporting requirements and mishap investigation boards will be sent
   to the Superintendent from the Command requesting support.
   5.7.3. Methods of Reporting. Digital recording will be used as the primary method of recording;
   stenotype may also be utilized, however, digital is preferred. Court reporters must use both a primary
   and backup system to ensure a record can be accurately prepared. The backup method for stenotype
   reporting will be digital recording.
70                                                         AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


5.8. Enlisted Court Reporters. The primary role of the enlisted court reporter is to fulfill the expedi-
tionary court reporting requirement and support mishap investigation boards. They also report and tran-
scribe courts-martial, administrative discharge boards, Article 32 hearings, depositions, and other
proceedings as the expeditionary mission allows.

Section 5C—Detailing and Excusing Members (RCM 501, 502(a), 503(a) and 505); Convening Orders
(RCM 504).

5.9. Detailing Members. Convening authorities detail the best qualified persons for courts-martial in
accordance with the criteria in Article 25(d), UCMJ. Enough members should be detailed so that, after
challenges, a general court-martial will be comprised of at least five members and a special court-martial
will be comprised of at least three members. Convening authorities may detail members under their com-
mand or others made available by their commander. When detailing court members, convening authori-
ties may consider nominees submitted by subordinate commanders. The SJA must guard against unlawful
command influence or the appearance of such in the court member selection process, which includes
ensuring no involvement by trial counsel or assistant trial counsel. When advising the convening authority
on court member selection, the SJA reiterates the Article 25(d), UCMJ, criteria. The SJA may prepare a
list of proposed nominees. If such a list is used, the SJA also informs the convening authority that he or
she may consider persons on the nomination list as well as any other eligible person subject to his or her
command or others made available by their commanders. The SJA maintains all documents submitted to
the convening authority.
     5.9.1. Enlisted Members (RCM 503(a)(2)). If an enlisted accused requests that enlisted members
     serve as court members, the convening authority details enlisted members, following the guidance in
     paragraph 5.8. The convening authority should detail enough enlisted members so that, after chal-
     lenges, the court will be comprised of at least one-third enlisted members. If officer members have
     already been detailed, the convening authority may replace officer members with enlisted members,
     or may detail enlisted members without excusing officer members. If the membership of the court
     falls below one-third enlisted members, the convening authority must detail additional enlisted mem-
     bers.

5.10. Changing or Excusing Detailed Members. Before the court-martial is assembled, the convening
authority may excuse members or change the members of a court-martial without showing cause. The
convening authority may delegate to the servicing SJA or other principal assistant the authority to excuse
individual members of a court-martial before a court is assembled. No more than one-third of the mem-
bers may be excused by anyone other than the convening authority. RCM 505(c).

5.11. Special Orders Convening Courts-Martial.
     5.11.1. Generally. Prepare convening orders in accordance with RCM 504, 1302, and this chapter.
     Authenticate convening orders according to this instruction. Cite the current Department of the Air
     Force Special Order or other document authorizing the commander to convene courts (Figure 5.1.).
     Convening orders can be amended. To reflect changes in court members, except when members are
     excused without replacement, amend the original order (Figure 5.2.). If excusal of a member without
     replacement is not reduced to writing, the excusal must be announced on the record. Generally, issue
     no more than two amendments to the original order. If it is necessary to further amend the convening
     order, do not issue a new amending order; instead, publish a new order convening a court-martial with
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                      71


  a savings clause that transfers all cases in which the court has not yet been assembled to the new order
  (Figure 5.3.). Ensure all amendments to a convening order and all convening orders with a savings
  clause cite all prior orders. Give a copy of all convening orders and amendments to convening orders
  to the military judge and include in all copies of the ROT.
  5.11.2. Numbering Convening Orders. Orders convening courts-martial are special orders that are
  numbered consecutively on a fiscal year basis, starting with number 1. The number shall follow an
  A-series letter prefix. AFI 33-328, Administrative Orders, Table 2.1, Rule 17. Use an A letter prefix
  for general courts-martial and an AB letter prefix for special courts-martial.
  5.11.3. Identification of Members. Special orders convening a court-martial should contain the
  name, rank, and unit of all persons detailed. Do not include personal information, i.e. social security
  number. If a detailed member is not under the command of the convening authority, ensure the special

                                               Chapter 6

               TRAVEL FUNDING, WITNESS PRODUCTION, AND IMMUNITY

Section 6A—Travel Funding

6.1. Funding Authorities. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, (hereinafter
“AFI65-601v1”), Table 10.2, prescribes the travel funding authorities for persons required for boards,
investigations and courts-martial. AFI 65-601v1 is controlling; however, the travel funding table is
reprinted at Figure 6.9.

6.2. AFLOA Central Travel Funding. AFLOA/JAJM centrally funds and manages travel for persons
identified in AFI 65-601v1, Table 10.2, for travel required for Article 32 investigations and courts-mar-
tial. AFLOA/JAJM does not fund travel for other matters related to UCMJ proceedings, such as travel to
and from depositions and administrative actions.
   6.2.1. Requesting AFLOA Central Travel Funds. RCM 703(c) governs the initial determination of
   whether to produce a witness. Once the determination is made to require the presence of a person
   whose travel is funded by AFLOA/JAJM, including a witness required by the military judge, the SJA
   requests travel funds electronically through the Witness Funding Management System (WFMS). The
   WFMS system will monitor all requests submitted by legal offices. This system provides an up to date
   status on each request. In addition, the system has bulletin and e-mail capability that allows JAJM’s
   Central Witness Funding (CWF) branch to provide essential information to the requesting base. The
   requester will need a FLITE ID and password to log into the database. The SJA, Chief and NCOIC of
   Military Justice are appointed as WFMS managers. The WFMS managers have the ability to reset per-
   missions and ensure the correct WFMS managers are posted at all times. All personnel assigned to the
   requesting legal office can create a request in the system. However, only WFMS mangers can
   approve, cancel and forward the request to JAJM. The WFMS managers are responsible for managing
   the status of witnesses until the witness voucher has been paid and if applicable expert fees are paid.
   WFMS will ensure all fields are completed prior to forwarding the request to JAJM.
   6.2.2. All requests should be electronically sent to AFLOA/JAJM at least 10 calendar days before the
   requested person is required to travel. https://AFLOA.jag.af.mil/flite/training/jaguar/wfms/
   wfms_home.php. An electronic approval will be sent via e-mail to the original requestor and the
   approving WFMS manager. Upon receipt of the approval, the requesting legal office will fill in the
   sample order provided by CWF and forward to the witness’ unit for signature. Both the witness and
   the Defense Travel System (DTS) approving official sign the ”Memorandum of Understanding” and
   fax to AFLOA/JAJM (DSN 754-7487 Comm 202-404-7487). See Figure 6.1. Once received, CWF
   will forward a fund-cite authorization letter to the DTS approving official. If a unit does not have
   access to DTS, contact AFLOA/JAJM for instructions. The requesting legal office is responsible for
   ensuring all TDY arrangements are made (flight reservations, billeting, rental car). AFLOA/JAJM
   does not fund rental cars unless it is determined to be advantageous to the government.
   6.2.3. Fund Citations and Travel Itinerary. AFLOA/JAJM furnishes procedural instructions for
   JAJM funded travel. Justification is required for witnesses requiring more than five temporary duty
   days including travel for stateside travel and seven temporary duty days for overseas travel. Obtain
   prior approval from AFLOA/JAJM for any deviations to the travel itinerary, or the organization
76                                                            AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


     approving such deviation may be responsible for additional costs. Witnesses subject to recall should
     remain in the local area until released to avoid travel itinerary deviations.
     6.2.4. Additional Responsibilities. If travel funded by AFLOA/JAJM is canceled after the TDY
     order is published, the requesting legal office WFMS manager must notify AFLOA/JAJM as soon as
     possible by requesting cancellation electronically through the WFMS system. The requesting office
     shall ensure travelers promptly prepare and submit travel vouchers. See 6.4.8. In cases involving an
     expert urinalysis witness, the SJA for the requesting legal office must also certify the attendance of
     expert witnesses before payment of expert fees may be made. All vouchers and expert fee payment
     documentation should be faxed to JAJM within 5 days of completion of travel. If a witness files a
     voucher 30 days after the suspense date, the travel voucher will be returned as no order on file. The
     witness will need confirmatory orders and a letter from his/her squadron commander explaining why
     the voucher was not filed within a timely manner prior to filing.
     6.2.5. Experts in Urinalysis Cases. AFLOA/JAJM centrally funds experts (forensic experts, e.g.,
     chemists, toxicologists, qualified physicians) approved by a convening authority to testify at
     courts-martial relating to urinalysis testing. Follow the instructions above and include the witness fee
     per day, travel costs and per diem. The request must include a statement of the convening authority's
     approval of the expert and the amount of compensation. Before requesting funding for a civilian
     expert witness, trial counsel must first ascertain the non-availability of the forensic urinalysis experts
     at the Air Force Drug Testing Laboratory, Brooks AFB, Texas, or any other expert under contract with
     the Air Force. SJAs should obtain written agreements with non-government civilian expert witnesses
     fixing their rate of compensation and reimbursement for expenses. A sample agreement is provided at
     Figure 6.3.
        6.2.5.1. Fee Limits. AFLOA/JAJM funding for urinalysis expert witness fees is limited to $1,000
        per day, with a maximum of $4,000 per witness, per case for in-court testimony only. Expert wit-
        ness fees paid by JAJM will not include payment for days devoted to travel. Any agreement to pay
        amounts exceeding JAJM's per day or per case limits is not binding on AFLOA/JAJM and may
        result in the convening authority paying the difference.
        6.2.5.2. Inconvenience Fees. AFLOA/JAJM may fund up to $500 per witness, per case, for
        inconvenience or cancellation fees for prior approved urinalysis experts. Inconvenience fees not
        approved in advance by AFLOA/JAJM will not be paid from central witness funds. Payment will
        not be considered appropriate unless a written agreement provided for inconvenience or cancella-
        tion fees at the time the witness' services were contracted. In every case, there must be a showing
        of actual inconvenience and financial loss to the witness, and cancellation within five days of the
        authorized travel date. In order to demonstrate actual inconvenience and financial loss, more than
        mere cancellation is required. Expert witnesses are expected to mitigate any financial loss caused
        by cancellation.
        6.2.5.3. Consultants. Central witness funds are to be used for expert witnesses, not consultants.
        The convening authority is responsible for payment of consultant services and fees. The funding
        request constitutes a representation the witness is expected to testify at the trial. However, should
        a JAJM approved and funded expert witness not testify at trial, funding authority will not be
        revoked.

Section 6B—Witness Production
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                      77


6.3. Military Witnesses. Provide notice to the witness and their commander of the time, place, and date
the witness’ presence is required, and request the commander issue any necessary orders to the witness.
RCM 703(e)(1).

6.4. Civilian Witnesses. Except as provided in paragraphs 6.4.4., 6.4.5., and 6.4.6., use DD Form 453,
Subpoena, and DD Form 453-1, Travel Order, to obtain the presence of civilian witnesses and to autho-
rize reimbursement for their travel expenses. Mark through any inapplicable dollar amount in parentheses
on DD Form 453-1 and insert the applicable dollar amount in the space provided. RCM 703(e)(2) Discus-
sion.
   6.4.1. Informal Service for Willing Witnesses. When a civilian witness will appear voluntarily and
   a subpoena is issued, informal service of process by mail, including arrangements for travel and
   advance travel pay, is authorized. Figure 6.4. is a sample letter to accomplish informal service. RCM
   703(e)(2)(D), Discussion.
   6.4.2. Formal Service for Unwilling Witnesses. If a witness is unwilling to attend the court-martial
   voluntarily, serve the subpoena personally on the witness and tender travel orders and prescribed fees.
   RCM 703(e)(2)(D) and Discussion. Appropriate fees and mileage must be paid or tendered when
   serving the subpoena to meet the threshold requirement for requesting a Warrant of Attachment and
   subject the witness to federal prosecution under Article 47, UCMJ. Consult with the base Accounting
   & Finance Office (AFO) to determine the proper method of obtaining the necessary funds. The SJA or
   trial counsel may be designated as an accounting and finance certifying payment official in order to
   receive the witness travel funds for a personal service on the witness. In the alternative, the AFO may
   draft a check to the witness that accompanies the subpoena for service or attempted service upon the
   witness. Serve the subpoena in person, either by the trial counsel or a designee when the witness is in
   the local area, or contact the SJA or commander of the military installation nearest the witness for
   assistance. Personal service may also be requested through the local law enforcement office or AFOSI
   detachment nearest the witness.
   6.4.3. Failure to Appear. If the witness fails or refuses to appear, exhaust every reasonable means to
   secure live testimony. If necessary, use a DD Form 454, Warrant of Attachment, to compel the witness
   to appear or produce evidence. See RCM 703(e)(2)(G), Discussion; United States. v. Ortiz, 35 M.J.
   391 (CMA 1992). The witness may be prosecuted for failure to comply.
       6.4.3.1. Requirements for a Warrant of Attachment. A Warrant of Attachment may be issued
       only if in compliance with the provisions set out in RCM 703(e)(2)(G)(ii).
       6.4.3.2. Processing a Warrant of Attachment.
           6.4.3.2.1. In most cases, a Warrant of Attachment should be executed by the U.S. Marshal
           Service. Otherwise, anyone 18 years or older may execute a Warrant of Attachment. Military
           law enforcement may execute a Warrant of Attachment. However, military law enforcement
           should only be considered a last resort.
           6.4.3.2.2. Provide the U.S. Marshal’s Service with the following :
              6.4.3.2.2.1. A copy of the Warrant of Attachment;
              6.4.3.2.2.2. A copy of the subpoena;
              6.4.3.2.2.3. A copy of the certificate of service or receipt;
78                                                            AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


                6.4.3.2.2.4. An affidavit indicating that appropriate fees and mileage were tendered to the
                witness and the amount, reasons that witness is material and why it is believed the witness
                refuses or willfully neglects to appear;
                6.4.3.2.2.5. A Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) number. See para-
                graph 6.4.3.4.
            6.4.3.2.3. The U.S. Marshal’s Service General Counsel’s Office will review the Warrant of
            Attachment and determine the appropriate executing office. As this process can take some
            time, trial counsel or the Government representative should consider requesting relief pursuant
            to RCM 707(c) if applicable.
            6.4.3.2.4. If the U.S. Marshal Service is executing the Warrant of Attachment, it will make
            travel, lodging, and housing arrangements for the escorts and witness as appropriate. Other-
            wise, the Government is responsible for making travel, lodging and housing arrangements for
            the escorts and witness.
            6.4.3.2.5. Only such non-deadly force as is necessary to bring the witness to the proceeding is
            authorized.
        6.4.3.3. Escorting and Detaining a Civilian Witness. Once a Warrant of Attachment is exe-
        cuted, the civilian witness must be under escort or otherwise accounted for at all times. Escort and
        housing of a civilian witness ceases once a determination is made by the authority issuing the war-
        rant that the witness is no longer needed for the proceeding.
            6.4.3.3.1. If the U.S. Marshal’s Service or other civilian law enforcement agency did not exe-
            cute the Warrant of Attachment, a civilian witness must be accompanied by a minimum of two
            escorts at all times. Armed escorts should be use as a last resort and only if absolutely neces-
            sary.
            6.4.3.3.2. If it is necessary to house a civilian witness prior to the proceeding and the U.S.
            Marshal’s Service or other civilian law enforcement agency did not execute the Warrant of
            Attachment, coordinate with the U.S. Marshal’s Service to arrange for housing of the witness
            in the nearest available civilian detention facility. Every effort should be made to minimize the
            amount of time a civilian witness is housed in a civilian detention facility. Never house a civil-
            ian witness in a military confinement facility.
        6.4.3.4. Funding. The funding authority responsible for funding the travel of the witness pursu-
        ant to Figure 6.9. is also responsible for funding the travel of personnel necessary to effect the
        execution of the Warrant of Attachment and escort the witness to the location specified in the sub-
        poena. If detention of the witness is required, either at the location the Warrant of Attachment is
        executed or at the location specified in the subpoena, the funding authority responsible for funding
        the travel of the witness is also responsible for fees charged by the facility detaining the witness. If
        the entity executing the Warrant of Attachment is another Federal agency, such as the U.S. Mar-
        shal’s Service, funding will be accomplished through a MIPR.
     6.4.4. Subpoena Limitations. A civilian witness may not be subpoenaed to testify at a court-martial
     outside the United States or at an Article 32, UCMJ, hearing. Issue Invitational Travel Orders (Figure
     6.5.) to a civilian witness who voluntarily agrees to appear at such proceedings. Joint Federal Travel
     Regulations (JFTR), Vol. 2, Appendix E. A sample letter to accompany the Invitational Travel Order
     is at Figure 6.4.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                       79


  6.4.5. Civilian Expert Witnesses (not employed by the United States). When a party considers
  government employment of a civilian expert witness necessary, the party shall submit a written
  request to the convening authority, with notice to the opposing party, to authorize the employment and
  fix the expert’s compensation. RCM 703(d). The terms of employment in approved requests should be
  memorialized in a Memorandum of Agreement for Expert Witnesses. See sample at Figure 6.3. Use
  Invitational Travel Orders (Figure 6.5.) to authorize travel of civilian experts. JTR, Vol. 2, para.
  C3103 and Appendix E.
  6.4.6. Civilians Employed by the United States. Civilian employees of the United States can be
  required to testify incident to their employment with appropriate travel orders issued for this purpose.
  A subpoena is not required. For DoD civilian employees requested as witnesses, the appropriate travel
  order is the DD Form 1610, Request and Authorization for TDY Travel of DoD Personnel. For
  non-DoD federal civilian employees providing testimony incident to their employment, the
  employee’s agency will prepare the appropriate travel order. Do not use Invitational Travel Orders for
  federal civilian employees, contractors or Non-Appropriated Fund employees.
  6.4.7. Subpoenas to the Media. Air Force policy requires the exercise of due care when issuing sub-
  poenas to media organizations to avoid unnecessary imposition on the news gathering process and
  thereby protect the media's First Amendment role.
     6.4.7.1. Prior to issuing a subpoena to a member of the news media, trial counsel will consult with
     the Special Court-Martial Convening Authority (SPCMCA) staff judge advocate (SJA). The SPC-
     MCA SJA will forward a request to the General Court-Martial Convening Authority (GCMCA)
     SJA addressing the following points:
         6.4.7.1.1. That all reasonable attempts were made to obtain the information sought from alter-
         native sources;
         6.4.7.1.2. That all reasonable alternative investigative steps were taken to obtain the informa-
         tion sought;
         6.4.7.1.3. The results of negotiations with the media. Negotiations should make clear the gov-
         ernment’s needs in the particular case and its willingness to respond to particular concerns of
         the media;
         6.4.7.1.4. That reasonable grounds exist to conclude, based on information obtained from
         other sources, that a crime has occurred and that the information sought is essential to the case;
         and,
         6.4.7.1.5. That to the extent possible, the subpoena is directed at material information regard-
         ing a limited subject matter, will cover a reasonably limited period of time, and will avoid
         requiring production of a large volume of unpublished material.
     6.4.7.2. The GCMCA SJA will approve or disapprove the issuance of the subpoena. The SPC-
     MCA SJA will immediately file a Special Interest Report (SIR) IAW paragraph 13.8. of this
     instruction.
     6.4.7.3. In the event exigent circumstances prevent prior consultation with the GCMCA SJA, a
     trial counsel may only issue a subpoena with the SPCMCA SJA’s approval. In that case, the SJA
     will immediately inform the GCMCA SJA, MAJCOM SJA, and AFLOA/JAJM by e-mail or fax
     of the issuance of the subpoena and the exigent circumstances that precluded prior consultation.
80                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


        6.4.7.4. The principles set forth in this guidance are not intended to create or recognize any
        legally enforceable right in any person.
     6.4.8. Rates for Civilian Witnesses.
        6.4.8.1. Civilians Employed by the United States. When summoned as a witness, a civilian in
        the employ of the government shall be paid as authorized by the JTR, Vol. 2 (for DoD civilian
        employees) or by the Federal Travel Regulation, 41 C.F.R. §§ 300-304 (for non-DoD civilian
        employees).
        6.4.8.2. Civilians Not Employed by the United States. Pay fees and allowances authorized
        under 28 U.S.C. § 1821 (per diem, mileage, subsistence). JTR, Vol. 2, para. C4562 and Appendix
        E.
     6.4.9. Processing Vouchers. Use a DD Form 1351-2, (Travel Voucher or Subvoucher); DD Form
     1351, Travel Voucher; SF Form 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other than Per-
     sonal; and/or SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business. The SJA with
     administrative responsibility for the proceeding in which the witness testified ensures the witness pre-
     pares and submits the forms to the AFO servicing the base where the court convened, however, Cen-
     trally Funded Witnesses’ forms are sent to AFLOA/JAJM for processing. Before AFLOA/JAJM pays
     for a civilian expert witness, the SJA must certify the dates of attendance and any scheduled witness
     fees (expert testimony, inconvenience). See sample certification memo at Figure 6.8.

6.5. Special Witness Production Issues.
     6.5.1. Foreign Area Clearance. Allow appropriate time for the processing of foreign area clearances
     when witnesses must travel to courts-martial convened outside the United States. (AFI 24-405, DoD
     Foreign Clearance Guide; DoD Directive 4500.54, Official Temporary Duty Travel Abroad). Ensure
     the prospective witness has a passport or applies for one.
     6.5.2. AFOSI. Submit requests for AFOSI agents to the AFOSI detachment to which the agent is
     assigned. Submit requests for threatened airmen and confidential sources to the local AFOSI detach-
     ment. Only AFOSI may contact another installation to request threatened airmen and confidential
     sources.
     6.5.3. Deployed Witness. Contact AFLOA/JAJM in cases requiring the return of a deployed witness.

Section 6C—Immunity

6.6. Grants of Immunity (RCM 704 & MRE 301(c)). Only a GCMCA possesses the authority to grant
immunity to witnesses. All grants of immunity must be in writing and attached to the ROT as an allied
paper. Figure 6.8. is a sample grant of immunity and order to testify.
     6.6.1. Witnesses Not Subject to UCMJ. The GCMCA may disapprove immunity requests for wit-
     nesses not subject to the UCMJ without DOJ coordination. However, the GCMCA may approve such
     requests only after receiving authorization from the Attorney General of the United States or other
     authority designated under 18 U.S.C. § 6004. Prepare requests for DOJ authorization in accordance
     with paragraph 6.6.4.
     6.6.2. Witnesses Who May Be Considered for Federal Prosecution. If DOJ has an interest in
     investigating and prosecuting a witness suspected of criminal activity pursuant to DoD Directive
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                         81


  5525.7, Implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding Between the Department of Justice
  and the Department of Defense Relating to the Investigation and Prosecution of Certain Crimes
  (found in the Manual for Courts Martial, Appendix 3), prepare the immunity request according to
  paragraph 6.6.4., regardless of whether the witness is subject to the UCMJ.
  6.6.3. National Security Cases. Process immunity requests for witnesses suspected of criminal
  activity involving national security, as specified in 13.8.2.3., according to 6.6.4., regardless of whether
  the witness is subject to the UCMJ. AFLOA/JAJM is responsible for coordinating such cases with the
  DOJ and other interested United States agencies. NOTE: Complete the additional reporting and pro-
  cessing requirements specified in 13.8. for national security cases independent of immunity authoriza-
  tion requests.
  6.6.4. Requests for DOJ Authorization. In cases requiring DOJ authorization, the SJA administer-
  ing the court-martial initiates the request for DOJ authorization. When the GCMCA indicates an
  intent to grant immunity, the GCMCA SJA forwards the request with written endorsement, preferably
  by facsimile, directly to AFLOA/JAJM, with information copies to the MAJCOM SJA. Forward
  requests 30 days in advance of the date the witness is expected to testify. Consider requesting a delay
  pursuant to RCM 707(c)(1) while authorization is pending. Include the following information in the
  request:
  6.6.4. (AMC) Requests for DOJ Authorization. Send an information copy to HQ AMC/JAAM,
  102 E. Martin St., Rm N-119, Scott AFB IL 62225-5012.
     6.6.4.1. Case name and nature of the proceeding for which requesting immunity;
     6.6.4.2. Nature of the charges against the accused and anticipated date of the proceeding;
     6.6.4.3. Name, social security number, date and place of birth, and address of the witness;
     6.6.4.4. The witness' military status and organization, if any;
     6.6.4.5. Whether the defense or prosecution requested the immunity;
     6.6.4.6. Name, grade, organization, and mailing address of the GCMCA who will grant the
     immunity after receiving DOJ authorization and a statement that the GCMCA supports the immu-
     nity request. (Note: Immunity is not actually granted until approved by the GCMCA after receiv-
     ing DOJ authorization.);
     6.6.4.7. An explanation of why immunity is necessary, including whether any state or Federal
     charges are pending against the witness and a description of those charges, if any;
     6.6.4.8. Whether the witness is currently incarcerated and, if so, the location, cause, and length of
     incarceration;
     6.6.4.9. A summary of the witness' expected testimony;
     6.6.4.10. Factual basis for believing the witness will assert the privilege against self-incrimina-
     tion, including the nature of the offenses in which the witness may be incriminated;
     6.6.4.11. The likelihood of the witness testifying, should immunity be granted;
     6.6.4.12. Name, title, address and telephone number of the representative from the local State’s
     Attorney’s Office and United States Attorney's Office with whom trial counsel coordinated the
     request. Include information on whether the representative supports or opposes the request.

     6.6.5. Preliminary Discussions of Immunity. Judge advocates and investigators must be exceed-
     ingly careful in discussing the possibility of immunity with anyone involved in an investigation or
     potential prosecution. Avoid creating a perceived expectation of immunity that may be unfounded.
     The best practice is to first coordinate potential grants of immunity with the convening authority, and
     when appropriate, DOJ.

        You are invited to proceed from ([home address] [work address]) on [date travel begins] to arrive
at [place required] by [time required] for the purpose of [purpose of travel, e.g., testifying in the Article 32
investigation of A1C John Doe] for approximately ___ days. Upon completion, you shall return to the
point of origin.

___and/or Privately Owned Conveyance (see below)


___The order-issuing agent has arranged transportation.
___Transportation tickets are included with this order.
___Transportation tickets shall be provided at a later date.


(NOTE: PLEASE GUARD TRANPORTATION TICKETS CAREFULLY. If a transportation ticket in
your possession is lost or stolen, you must immediately report it to [name and phone number of POC at
legal office]. You must return unused transportation tickets with the travel claim.)


___To arrange transportation, call: (____) ____ - _____.


___You may arrange transportation. The following rules apply:
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                        91


       You must arrange your transportation with a travel office under contract with the U.S. Government
       when the travel office is authorized by contract to arrange transportation for travelers who are not
       Government employees. If you are in a foreign country, except for Canada and Mexico, you may
       use a travel office not under contract to the Government if ticketing cannot be secured from a
       branch office or general agent of an American-flag carrier. If you purchase transportation from a
       travel office not under contract to the Government, reimbursement is limited to the cost to the
       Government on a constructive basis for transportation that would have been arranged by a travel
       office under contract with the Government if available. If the contract between the Government
       and the travel office does not permit the travel office to arrange transportation for contractor/
       contractor employees or others who are not Government employees, reimbursement for
       transportation may not exceed coach class air accommodations unless otherwise permitted in the
       Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), para. C2204-A.


       DoD policy in using regularly scheduled air transportation is:


       (a) accommodations selected shall be the least costly service that permits satisfactory
       accomplishment of the mission of the traveler, and


       (b) United States carriers must be used for all commercial foreign air transportation if service
       provided by those carriers is available; otherwise, reimbursement for the cost of transportation is
       not allowed.


___You are authorized to travel by Privately Owned Conveyance as advantageous to the Government.
Reimbursement shall be at the rate of $0.___ per mile, plus the cost of necessary parking fees and bridge,
ferry and tolls incurred, including per diem, while in travel status under this travel order.


___You are authorized to travel by Privately Owned Conveyance on a constructive basis. You would nor-
mally be authorized to travel by common carrier. Reimbursement shall be limited to the cost of travel by
the usual mode of common carrier, including per diem.




         Receipts: Ticket stubs are required to substantiate your transportation cost. Receipts are required
for lodging. Receipts are required for all items of expense in an amount of $75 or more, plus any applica-
ble tax.




___You are paid a per diem allowance to cover your expenses for lodging and meals and incidental
expenses (M&IE). Room taxes at locations in the 50 states, District of Columbia, territories and posses-
sions and the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and Northern Mariana Islands are reimbursed separately.

Room taxes in foreign areas are included in the total lodging cost and are not reimbursed separately.
While traveling in connection with the Invitational Travel Order, you are authorized a per diem equal to
the daily amount you pay for lodging, plus a fixed amount for meals and incidental expenses (M&IE).
That amount is limited to the applicable maximum amount prescribed on the Per Diem Committee home-
page: http://www.dtic.mil/perdiem/pdrates.html for the locality concerned. Even if your costs, particu-
larly for lodging, are more than the applicable maximum per diem rate prescribed, only the maximum per
diem rate is payable. (See the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), Chapter 4, Part L, for applicable
rules.)


       Applicable per diem rates:


       Locality:
       Maximum Lodging Rate:
       M&IE Rate:
       Total Per Diem:


___You shall be paid an actual subsistence expense allowance (AEA) for lodging and a per diem for
meals and incidental expenses (M&IE). You are required to itemize your lodging expenses only.


___You shall be paid an actual subsistence expense allowance (AEA) for lodging and meals and inciden-
tal expenses (M&IE). You must itemize all you subsistence expenses. Subsistence expenses include lodg-
ing; meals; fees and tips to waiters, bellboys, maids and porters; personal laundry, pressing and dry
cleaning (see NOTE below); local transportation (including usual tips) between places of lodging, duty
and where meals are taken; and other necessary expenses. You shall be reimbursed for the actual expenses
incurred, but not to exceed the maximum amount authorized for the locality concerned. (See the Joint
Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), Chapter 4, Part M, for applicable rules.)


       Applicable rates when AEA authorized:


       Locality:
       Maximum AEA:
       Amount allowed for M&IE (if authorized on a per diem basis):


(NOTE: The cost you incur during travel (not after returning) for laundry/dry cleaning and pressing of
clothing is a separately reimbursable expense in addition to per diem/AEA when travel is within CONUS
and requires at least 4 consecutive nights lodging while on Government travel. There is no separate reim-
bursement for laundry/dry cleaning and pressing of clothing when travel is OCONUS. Those costs are
part of the per diem/AEA when travel is OCONUS.)

NOTES:
     1. The JFTR, volume 1, chapter 7, part O, covers travel of members for disciplinary action. The
        TDY orders for members traveling as an Accused must include a statement "member not enti-
        tled to per diem expenses in connection with disciplinary action."
          2. Funding by the Centralized Docketing Office for USAF Judiciary Members. The Convening
             Authority funds costs for other individuals.
          3. AFLOA/JAJM will fund the travel if the IMDC is not assigned to the USAF Judiciary at the
             time the IMDC request is made and had no prior attorney-client relationship with the
             requester on the matter in issue.
          4. The JFTR, volume 1, paragraph U7060, directs that travel expenses of members summoned as
             witnesses shall be paid from funds of the requesting service.
          5. Submit requests through local AFOSI detachments. Fund according to the status of the person
             requested (e.g., AF Active Duty, Reservist, ANG, civilian, etc. as noted in the table).
          6. AFOSI agents assigned as defense investigators to an accused and defense counsel are funded
             by the convening authority.
          7. For expert witnesses in urinalysis cases, request AFLOA/JAJM funding in accordance with
             AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice. All fees in excess of AFLOA/JAJM estab-
             lished fee limits shall be paid by the convening authority. The convening authority funds civil-
             ian expert consultants and lab technicians in urinalysis cases.
          8. Funding for testimony of federal civilian employees belonging to non-DoD agencies is a con-
             vening authority responsibility. However, if a non-DoD civilian employee is called to present
             testimony in a case that involves an activity in connection with which he or she is employed,
             funding from the employing agency may be possible. See 5 U.S.C. §5751 and 28 C.F.R., Part
             21, Section 21.2(d). The Comptroller General has defined the extent to which the case must be
             related to the agency’s activity as a condition to the agency’s responsibility for payment in 23
             Comp. Gen. 47, 49 (1943) which states “the employing agency is required to pay . . . the trav-
             eling expenses incurred by the employee witness only where the information or facts ascer-

        tained by the employee as part of his official duties forms the basis of the case, or where the
        proceeding is predicated upon law that that agency is required to administer.” Funding from
        other agencies under 5 U.S.C. §5751 should only be sought in situations where the other
        agency’s funding responsibility can be clearly established under the law. Furthermore, if the
        employing agency is not forthcoming with the funds, ultimate responsibility for funding to
        ensure the presence of necessary witness remains with the convening authority.

        required if it involves inter-command travel between the Title 10 duty station and the location
        of the UCMJ proceeding.
     10. The JFTR, volume 1, paragraph U7451, and AFI 31-205, The Air Force Corrections System,
         cover funding of prisoners and prisoner escorts. The prisoner’s travel will be funded accord-
         ing to the status of the prisoner (e.g., AF Active Duty, Reservist, ANG, civilian, etc. as noted
         in the table). The convening authority requesting the prisoner’s appearance will provide escort
         funding.

                                                  Chapter 7

                                 VICTIM AND WITNESS ASSISTANCE

Section 7A—Purpose and Objectives

7.1. Purpose. This chapter describes the Air Force Victim and Witness Assistance Program (VWAP),
implements the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. §§ 10601-10605), the Victims'
Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. §§ 10606, 10607), DoD Directive 1030.1, Victim and Wit-
ness Assistance and DoD Instruction 1030.2, Victim and Witness Assistance Procedures. This chapter
establishes responsibility for the VWAP at the Headquarters Air Force and subordinate levels. It provides
guidance for the treatment of victims and witnesses of offenses under the UCMJ, and victims and wit-
nesses of offenses under the jurisdiction of local, state, other federal, or foreign authorities during those
stages of the criminal justice process conducted primarily by the Air Force. This chapter provides guid-
ance for the protection and assistance of victims and witnesses, enhances their roles in the military crimi-
nal justice process, and preserves the constitutional rights of an accused. Figure 7.1. provides a list of
VWAP responsibilities with the corresponding responsible base agencies. These provisions create no
cause of action or defense in favor of any person arising out of a failure to comply with the VWAP. The
VWAP places no limitations on the lawful prerogatives of Air Force personnel.
      7.1.1. Application of the VWAP. The VWAP applies in all cases in which criminal conduct
      adversely affects victims or in which witnesses provide information regarding criminal activity if any
      portion of the investigation is conducted primarily by the DoD Components. Pay special attention to
      victims of serious, violent crime, but ensure all victims and witnesses of crime who suffer physical,
      financial, or emotional trauma receive the assistance and protection to which they are entitled. While
      various Air Force agencies have particular responsibility for the VWAP, the provision of victim and
      witness assistance is to be a coordinated effort among all agencies providing services to individuals.

7.2. Objectives. Within available resources and in accordance with applicable law, the following are
objectives of the Air Force VWAP:
      7.2.1. Mitigate the physical, psychological, and financial hardships suffered by victims and witnesses
      of offenses investigated by US Air Force authorities;
      7.2.2. Foster cooperation of victims and witnesses within the military criminal justice system; and
      7.2.3. Ensure best efforts are made to accord to victims of crime certain enumerated rights.

Section 7B—Definitions

7.3. Victim. A person who suffered direct physical, emotional, or financial harm as the result of an
offense. Victims include, but are not limited to:
      7.3.1. All military members and their family members, and DoD civilian employees and their family
      members when stationed outside the continental United States;
      7.3.2. When a victim is incompetent, incapacitated, deceased, or under 18 years of age, one of the fol-
      lowing may represent the victim (in order of priority):

       7.3.2.7. Another person designated by a court.
   7.3.3. An authorized representative of the institutional entity.

7.4. Witness. A person who has information or evidence of a crime and provides that information or evi-
dence to an Air Force official. When the witness is a minor the term includes an appropriate family mem-
ber as discussed in 7.3.2. The term "witness" does not include an individual allegedly involved in a crime
as a conspirator, accomplice, or principal.

7.5. Offense. An offense is a crime punishable under the UCMJ committed by a person subject to the
UCMJ.

7.6. Responsible Official (RO). The Air Force official responsible for coordinating, implementing and
managing the Air Force VWAP. The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) is the Air Force RO.

7.7. Local Responsible Official (LRO). The individual responsible for identifying victims and wit-
nesses of crimes and providing the services required by the VWAP. Each installation commander is the
LRO. Installation commanders may delegate the LRO duties and responsibilities to the SJA. The delega-
tion must be in writing and addressed to the base SJA by duty title rather than name. The SJA may further
delegate the LRO duties and responsibilities in writing to a VWAP Coordinator while maintaining over-
sight and overall responsibility for the program. References in this chapter to the LRO include the SJA or
VWAP Coordinator, if delegated LRO duties and responsibilities, and other individuals tasked by the
LRO to assist with the VWAP.

7.8. VWAP Coordinator. The individual selected by the SJA to implement and manage the VWAP.
Responsible for ensuring the accomplishment of required training by all local agencies. The VWAP Coor-
dinator may also serve as victim liaison as appropriate under the circumstances of a particular case.

7.9. Victim Liaison. An individual appointed by the LRO or delegate, to assist a victim during the mili-
tary justice process. The designation need not be in writing. The liaison may be a medical or mental health
care provider, judge advocate, paralegal, or other person appropriate under the circumstances of a partic-
ular case. A liaison is responsible for making contact between victims and service agencies and arranging
for those services, when appropriate. Communications between a liaison and a victim are not confidential
or privileged (See MRE 513 regarding the privilege in judicial proceedings for communications between
psychotherapists and patients).

7.10. Central Repository. A central organization for confinee information, charged with establishing
procedures to ensure victims, who so elect, are notified of changes in confinee status. The USAF central
repository is Headquarters Air Force Security Forces Center (HQ AFSFC/SFC), Corrections Division/

Section 7D—Services Provided to Victims and Witnesses

7.12. LRO Responsibilities to Victims. The LRO, or other officials designated in this chapter, shall:
      7.12.1. Designate a victim liaison to assist individual victims when necessary.
      7.12.2. Inform the victim of the place where the victim may receive emergency medical and social
      service, and when necessary provide appropriate assistance in securing the care; and
      7.12.3. Inform the victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled and
      how to obtain the relief.
         7.12.3.1. Restitution may be available from, or offered by, an accused as a condition in the terms
         of a PTA, during the sentencing process, as a part of post-trial mitigation (RCM 1105), or as a term
         or condition of parole or clemency. SJAs provide information on possible restitution from local,
         state or federal crime victims’ funds, including procedures for applying for such funds.
         7.12.3.2. Inform victims that Article 139, UCMJ, may provide relief if the property loss or dam-
         age resulted from wrongful taking or willful damage by a member of the Armed Forces due to
         riotous, violent, or disorderly conduct. See Chapter 6, AFI 51-502, Personnel and Government
         Recovery Claims. Ensure an Article 139 investigation does not interfere with any criminal investi-
         gation or court-martial proceedings.
      7.12.4. Inform victims of intra-familial abuse offenses of the availability of limited transitional com-
      pensation benefits, waiver of mandatory forfeitures, and possible entitlement to a portion of the active

      ate, arrange for the victim to receive reasonable protection from an accused and from individuals act-
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                       105


  ing in concert with the accused. Instruct the victim to immediately report any intimidation, harassment
  or similar conduct to military authorities. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1512 and 1513.
     7.12.7.1. In cases where a victim's life, well-being or safety is jeopardized or threatened by partic-
     ipation in the military justice process, the LRO ensures immediate notification of appropriate law
     enforcement agencies. Air Force law enforcement agencies promptly take measures to provide
     protection for the victim, as allowed by jurisdictional restrictions. Assist victims in obtaining
     restraining orders or similar protections available from civilian agencies.
  7.12.8. Provide the victim with the earliest possible notice of:
     7.12.8.1. The status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it will not interfere with the
     investigation and is appropriate;
     7.12.8.2. The accused's pretrial status and any subsequent change in that status, including but not
     limited to, the accused being placed in pretrial confinement, being released from pretrial confine-
     ment, or escaping from pretrial confinement;
     7.12.8.3. Preferral and referral of charges or a decision not to pursue prosecution;
     7.12.8.4. A pretrial confinement hearing and/or Article 32 investigation;
     7.12.8.5. Notification of the scheduling, including changes and delays, of each court-martial pro-
     ceeding the victim is entitled to or required to attend;
     7.12.8.6. The acceptance of a guilty plea or announcement of findings; and
     7.12.8.7. The sentence imposed, including the date on which the accused becomes eligible for
     release from confinement, or parole, if applicable.
  7.12.9. During trial proceedings provide the victim with:
     7.12.9.1. A waiting area removed from and out of the sight and hearing of the accused and
     defense witnesses; and
     7.12.9.2. Appropriate assistance in obtaining available services such as transportation, parking,
     child care, lodging, and courtroom translators or interpreters.
  7.12.10. Safeguard any of the victim's property held as evidence and return it to the victim as soon as
  possible.
  7.12.11. If requested by the victim, take reasonable steps to inform the victim's employer of the rea-
  sons for the victim's absence from work. In appropriate cases, assist a victim subjected to serious
  financial strain directly resulting from a crime, or cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of an
  offense, in explaining reasons for financial strains to creditors. However, this does not entitle victims
  to formal legal assistance, AFI 51-504, Legal Assistance, Notary and Preventive Law Programs.
  7.12.12. Under ordinary circumstances, consult with the victim and obtain their view concerning:
     7.12.12.1. Decisions not to prefer charges;
     7.12.12.2. Dismissal of charges;
     7.12.12.3. Pretrial restraint or confinement, particularly an accused's possible release from any
     pretrial restraint or confinement;
     7.12.12.4. Pretrial agreement negotiations, including PTA terms;
106                                                            AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


         7.12.12.5. Plea negotiations;
         7.12.12.6. Discharge or resignation in lieu of trial by court-martial; and
         7.12.12.7. Scheduling of judicial proceedings where the victim is required or entitled to attend.
      7.12.13. Consultation may be limited when it could endanger the safety of the victim or a witness,
      jeopardize an ongoing investigation, disclose classified or privileged information, or unduly delay dis-
      position of an offense. Although the victims' views should be considered, nothing in the VWAP limits
      the responsibility and authority of officials involved in the military justice process from taking any
      action deemed necessary in the interest of good order and discipline and the prevention of service-dis-
      crediting conduct.
      7.12.14. After trial, provide the victim the earliest possible notice of:
         7.12.14.1. Consideration of the accused by the SECAF Clemency and Parole Board for clemency
         or parole;
         7.12.14.2. The escape, work release, furlough, or any other form of release from custody of the
         accused; or,
         7.12.14.3. The death of the accused, if the accused dies while in custody.
      7.12.15. Ensure that any property of the victim that is being held for evidentiary purposes be main-
      tained in good condition and returned to the victim as soon as it is no longer needed.

7.13. Airman and Family Readiness Center (A&FRC) Responsibilities to Crime Victims. T h e
A&FRC maintains information on available treatment, counseling, and support programs, acting as the
focal point between victims and those programs. The A&FRC chief or a designee works with other instal-
lation agencies to identify victims' needs and determine appropriate forms of assistance and resources
available through military and community services. The A&FRC provides information to victims on
available medical, financial, legal, and other social services, and assists victims in obtaining those ser-
vices. At installations without an A&FRC, the LRO appoints an individual to provide information to vic-
tims.
      7.13.1. In cases where referring a victim to the A&FRC for information may potentially cause undue
      embarrassment for the victim, LROs are encouraged to provide VWAP information directly to the vic-
      tim.

7.14. Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program. It is Air Force and Department of Defense
policy to eliminate sexual assault within the Department of Defense by providing a culture of prevention,
education and training, response capability, victim support, reporting procedures, and accountability that
enhances the safety and well-being of all its members. A key component of this policy is to provide an
immediate, trained response capability for each report of sexual assault in all locations, including
deployed locations, and to ensure victims of sexual assault are protected, treated with dignity and respect,
and receives timely access to appropriate treatment and services.
      7.14.1. Within the Air Force, the Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC) implements and
      manages the installation level Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program (SAPR). In addition
      to assisting commanders in meeting annual sexual assault prevention and response training require-
      ments, the SARC serves as the single point of contact for integrating and coordinating sexual assault
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                         107


   victim care from an initial report of sexual assault, through disposition and resolution of issues related
   to the victim’s health and well-being.
   7.14.2. Air Force Victim Advocates (VA) are appointed by the SARC to provide essential support,
   liaison services and care to the victim. Responsibilities include providing crisis intervention, referral
   and ongoing non-clinical support, including information on available options and resources to assist
   the victim in making informed decisions about the case. VA services will continue until the victim
   states support is no longer needed. VAs do not provide counseling or other professional services to a
   victim but refer the victim to the appropriate agency for clinical, legal, and other professional services.
   VAs may accompany the victim, at the victim’s request, during investigative interviews and medical
   examinations.
   7.14.3. The VWAP and SAPR programs are distinct but complimentary programs providing support
   and services to the victims as required by their governing directives. The LRO, or other officials
   appointed in this chapter, and the SARC and VA, must work in concert to discharge their individual
   responsibilities and provide the victim appropriate information on available options and resources,
   notice of relevant events in the investigative and judicial processes, and support. The LRO, or any
   other official appointed in this chapter, remains responsible for the delivery of VWAP services.

7.15. LRO Responsibilities to Witnesses. The LRO or other officials designated in this chapter shall:
   7.15.1. Inform eligible witnesses about protection from intimidation or similar threats, and, if appro-
   priate, arrange for a witness to receive reasonable protection from an accused and from individuals
   acting in concert with or at the behest of the accused. Advise witnesses to immediately report any
   intimidation, harassment, or similar conduct to military authorities.
       7.15.1.1. In a case where a witness' life, well-being, or safety is jeopardized or threatened by par-
       ticipation in the military justice process, the LRO ensures immediate notification to appropriate
       law enforcement agencies. Air Force law enforcement agencies promptly take measures to pro-
       vide protection for the witness, as allowed by jurisdictional restrictions. Assist witnesses in
       obtaining restraining orders or similar protections available from civilian agencies. Inform wit-
       nesses of any changes in accused's pretrial status, including, the accused being placed in pretrial
       confinement, being released from pretrial confinement, or escaping from pretrial confinement.
       7.15.1.2. If requested by a witness, take reasonable steps to inform the witness' employer of the
       reasons for the witness' absence from work. In appropriate cases, assist a witness subjected to seri-
       ous financial strain directly resulting from a crime, or cooperation in the investigation or prosecu-
       tion of an offense, in explaining reasons for financial strains to creditors. This does not entitle a
       witness to formal legal assistance, under AFI 51-504, Legal Assistance, Notary and Preventive
       Law Programs..
       7.15.1.3. Provide witnesses with appropriate assistance in obtaining available services such as
       transportation, parking, child care, lodging, and courtroom translators or interpreters.
       7.15.1.4. To the extent possible and when appropriate, afford witnesses the opportunity to wait in
       an area separate from the accused or defense witnesses to avoid embarrassment, coercion, or sim-
       ilar emotional distress.
       7.15.1.5. Inform witnesses of the time and place of each trial proceeding the witness is either
       required or entitled to attend. Promptly notify the witness of any scheduling changes.
108                                                            AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


      7.15.2. Determine the extent to which each individual witness is provided services or information
      under this paragraph. For example, active duty military, expert, or character witnesses ordinarily do
      not require all these services.
      7.15.3. Provide information and services to witnesses for a suspect or accused, if requested by
      defense counsel, and authorized by the LRO.

7.16. LRO Responsibilities to Others Entitled to Notice. Witnesses, relatives of victims and witnesses
who are minors, and relatives of homicide victims are entitled to receive prompt notification of informa-
tion concerning cases. If requested, the LRO or other officials designated in this chapter shall notify the
individuals of the following:
      7.16.1. Apprehension of a suspect or an accused.
      7.16.2. Initial appearance of an accused before a pretrial confinement review officer or other judicial
      official.
      7.16.3. Pretrial release of an accused, or any changes in pretrial restrictions.
      7.16.4. Court-martial proceedings, including:
         7.16.4.1. Any pleas by the accused;
         7.16.4.2. Findings; and
         7.16.4.3. The sentence imposed, including the date on which the accused becomes eligible for
         release from confinement, or parole, if applicable.

Section 7E—Notifications, Form Processing, and Miscellaneous Information

7.17. Law Enforcement and Investigative Personnel. At the earliest opportunity after identification of
a crime victim or witness and when appropriate, law enforcement and investigative personnel shall pro-
vide to each victim and witness DD Form 2701, Initial Information for Victims and Witnesses of Crime.
The number of DD Forms 2701 distributed annually is reported to the base SJA or equivalent. Therefore,
the date this information is provided to the victim or witness shall be annotated on any incident report
form. When circumstances dictate, law enforcement and investigative personnel shall promptly inform all
victims about the availability of emergency medical care and applicable social services. When necessary,
secure the assistance of the A&FRC or victim liaison in obtaining available services in the military and/or
civilian community.

7.18. Government Trial Counsel or Designee.
      7.18.1. Prior to trial, the government trial counsel or designee provides the victim with a DD Form
      2702, Court-Martial Information for Victims and Witnesses of Crime, explaining victims’ rights and
      access to services. The number of DD Forms 2702 distributed annually is reported to the base SJA or
      equivalent.
      7.18.2. Witnesses requested or ordered to appear at Article 32 investigations or courts-martial may be
      entitled to reimbursement for their expenses under Articles 46 and 47, UCMJ, and RCM 405(g). Pro-
      vide victims and witnesses assistance in obtaining prompt payment of witness fees and related costs.
      When possible, establish local procedures for paying vouchers after normal duty hours when neces-
      sary to avoid undue hardship. See generally, Chapter 6, paragraphs 6.2. to 6.5.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                      109


   7.18.3. The government trial counsel or designee provides a victim with a DD Form 2703, Post-Trial
   Information for Victims and Witnesses of Crime, explaining the victim's post-trial rights. The number
   of DD Forms 2703 distributed annually is reported to the base SJA or equivalent.
   7.18.4. For all cases resulting in a sentence to confinement, the government trial counsel or designee
   completes DD Form 2704, Victim/Witness Certification and Election Concerning Inmate Status. Send
   one copy of the form to the Central Repository, Headquarters Air Force Security Forces Center (HQ
   AFSFC/SFC), 1517 Billy Mitchell Boulevard, Lackland AFB TX, 78236-0119, one copy to the con-
   finement facility where the accused is in post-trial confinement and give a redacted copy to the victim
   or witness. The victim’s/witness’ copy must not contain the accused’s SSN or any information con-
   cerning other victims or witnesses.
      7.18.4.1. The date the DD Form 2704 is given to the victim or witness must be recorded and the
      number of DD Forms 2704 distributed annually reported to the base SJA or equivalent.
      7.18.4.2. Do not attach a copy of the DD Form 2704 to any portion of any record to which the
      convicted member has access, including the ROT. Doing so could endanger the victim or witness.
      The DD Form 2704 is exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

7.19. Additional Confinement Notification Requirements
   7.19.1. If the sentence includes confinement, the SJA or VWAP coordinator is responsible for
   informing the victim of the convening authority's action on the findings and sentence of the
   court-martial, regardless of where the accused is confined when action is taken.
   7.19.2. Upon an offender’s entry into confinement, the VWAP coordinator at the military confine-
   ment facility shall obtain the DD Form 2704 to determine victim or witness notification requirements.
   If the form is unavailable, inquire of HQ AFSFC/SFC whether any victim or witness has requested
   notification of changes in the confinee status in the case. Clearly mark an individual's confinement
   records to indicate the case involves a victim who wants to be informed of the inmate's status.
   7.19.3. If an accused is confined at or near the installation where tried, the installation SF commander
   notifies the victim of an accused's escape, any form of release from custody, or death.
   7.19.4. When a victim or witness has requested notification of changes in confinee status on the DD
   Form 2704, and that status changes as listed below, use the DD Form 2705, Victim and Witness Noti-
   fication of Inmate Status, to notify the victim or witness. The date notifications are given must be
   recorded and the number of DD Forms 2705 distributed annually reported to the base SJA or equiva-
   lent. Provide the earliest possible notice of:
      7.19.4.1. The scheduling of a clemency or parole hearing for the inmate.
      7.19.4.2. The transfer of the inmate from one facility to another.
      7.19.4.3. The escape (and subsequent return to custody), work release, furlough, or any other
      form of release of the inmate from custody.
      7.19.4.4. The release of the inmate to parole supervision.
      7.19.4.5. The death of the inmate if the inmate dies while in custody.
      7.19.4.6. Changes in confinee status for any emergency or special temporary home release
      granted the inmate.

      7.19.5. On transfer of a confinee to another military confinement facility, forward the DD Form 2704
      to the gaining facility, with an information copy to the Central Repository, HQ AFSFC/SFC.
      7.19.6. Report the status of victim and witness notification requests to the Central Repository, HQ
      AFSFC/SFC, annually.
      7.19.7. Victims are entitled to provide input to an accused's disposition board prior to a parole eligi-
      bility date or the accused going before the Air Force Clemency and Parole Board. Each victim is
      responsible to keep HQ AFSFC/SFC informed of the victim's current address.

7.20. Local Civilian Agencies. LROs are encouraged to enter into an appropriate memorandum of
agreement with local civilian agencies to ensure cooperative relationships in identifying, reporting, inves-
tigating, and providing services and treatment to victims and witnesses.

Section 7F—Training and Self-Inspection

7.21. Training.
      7.21.1. General. All personnel involved in the military criminal justice process and those responsible
      for providing required services to victims and witnesses must be familiar with the requirements of the
      Air Force VWAP. The LRO is responsible for developing and implementing a program at each instal-
      lation. The LRO is also responsible for ensuring the accomplishment of required training by all local
      agencies.
      7.21.2. Development of the Training Program. The installation SJA, Chief of Security Forces
      (SF), Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) detachment commander, medical facility
      commander (SG), Airman and Family Readiness Center director (AFRC), installation chaplain (HC)
      and representatives from commanders and first sergeants develop local training programs to ensure
      compliance with the VWAP. Figure 7.2. provides a list of references for use in developing a training
      program.
      7.21.3. Accomplishment of Training. Each individual agency is responsible for training personnel
      on their responsibilities under this chapter. The SJA trains commanders and first sergeants. The LRO
      coordinates all training required by this chapter and ensures the provisions of this chapter are publi-
      cized to all military and civilian agencies providing victim and witness services within their commu-
      nities.
      7.21.4. Preparation of Victim Information Packet. Prepare a victim information packet at each
      installation through the coordinated efforts of the SJA, SF, AFOSI, SG, AFRC, HC and commanders
      and first sergeants. Provide the packet to each identified victim or witness. A model packet is at Fig-
      ure 7.3.
      7.21.5. Training Requirements for Investigative and Law Enforcement Personnel. I n v e s t i g a -
      tive and law enforcement personnel are often the first individuals to have contact with the victims of
      crimes. Their training must emphasize responsibilities to victims. At the earliest opportunity after
      detection of a crime and without interfering with the investigation, investigative and law enforcement
      personnel should make all efforts to:
         7.21.5.1. Identify the victim of a crime.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                     111


       7.21.5.2. Inform the victim of the name, title, business address and telephone number of the
       AFRC director or the victim liaison to whom a request for services should be addressed and assist
       the victim in making contact with those individuals when necessary.
       7.21.5.3. Inform the victim of available emergency medical and or social services.
       7.21.5.4. Inform the victim of the right to receive reasonable protection for the victim or witness
       whose life, well-being, or safety is jeopardized by participation in the military justice process.
   7.21.6. Funding for victim and witness assistance programs is an operations and maintenance-type
   expense.

7.22. Self-Inspection. Responsible officials should develop a system for assessing the effectiveness of
their victim and witness assistance program. For example, a questionnaire may be sent to victims and wit-
nesses soliciting their opinions about the assistance provided. SJAs should keep a checklist for each case
involving a victim, showing: for example, the dates information packets and notifications were provided
(with copies of all notification letters and indorsements). Figure 7.4. provides a model VWAP
Self-Inspection Checklist.
   7.22.1. Staff assistance visits will examine the effectiveness of victim and witness assistance pro-
   grams, as well as compliance with this instruction.

Section 7G—Reporting Requirements

7.23. Reporting Requirements. TJAG shall submit an annual report using the DD Form 2706, Annual
Report on Victim and Witness Assistance, to the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readi-
ness, Attention Legal Policy Office (OUSD (P&R) LLP), 4000 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC
20301-4000. Submit the report by 15 March for the preceding calendar year and address the assistance
provided victims and witnesses of crime. Each base SJA or equivalent reports the information required to
be reported by 7.23.1. through 7.23.4. through JA channels to their major command or equivalent. Major
commands, FOAs and DRUs consolidate the reports and forward them to AFLOA/JAJM to arrive no later
than 15 February of each year. The report shall include:
   7.23.1. The number of victims and witnesses who received a DD Form 2701 from law enforcement or
   criminal investigations personnel.
   7.23.2. The number of victims and witnesses who received a DD Form 2702 from the government
   trial counsel or designee.
   7.23.3. The number of victims and witnesses who received a DD Form 2703 from the government
   trial counsel or designee.
   7.23.4. The number of victims and witnesses who elected via the DD Form 2704 to be notified of
   changes in confinee status.
   7.23.5. Each confinement facility reports the information required to be reported by paragraphs
   7.22.6 and 7.22.7. to the central repository at HQ AFSFC/SFC, who will forward a consolidated report
   to AFLOA/JAJM to arrive no later than 15 February of each year.
   7.23.6. The number of victims and witnesses who were notified by confinement facility Victim Wit-
   ness Assistance Coordinators via the DD Form 2705 of changes in confinee status. Obtain this number
   from appropriate forms.
112                                                        AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


      7.23.7. The cumulative number of confinees for whom victim or witness notifications must be made
      by each confinement facility. Obtain this number by totaling the number of confinees with victim or
      witness notifications requirements as of 1 Jul 95, adding the number of new confinees with the
      requirement, and then subtracting the number of those confinees who were released, deceased, or
      transferred to another facility (federal, state, or sister service) during the reporting year.
      7.23.8. AFLOA/JAJM consolidates the numbers from the major commands, FOAs, DRUs and HQ
      AFSFC/SFC, records them on the DD Form 2706, and forwards the DD Form 2706 to TJAG.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                                         113

                5) the victim receives the necessary assistance in contacting the persons who are responsi-
ble for providing the services and relief described in subparagraphs 1), 2) and 3) above?


6. Are victims consulted or notified concerning the disposition of all cases relevant to them?


        a. Is the victim informed of the status of the investigation of the crime to the extent appropriate and
to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation?


         b. Is the victim informed of the arrest/apprehension of a suspected offender?


         c. Is the victim informed of the preferral of charges against a suspected offender?


        d. Is the victim informed of the scheduling of each court proceeding that the victim is required or
entitled to attend?


         e. Is the victim informed of the release or detention status of an offender or suspected offender?


         f. Is the victim informed of the acceptance of a plea of guilty or the rendering of a verdict after
trial?


       g. Is the victim informed of the sentence imposed on an offender, including the date on which the
offender will be eligible for parole?

        h. Does the installation commander or SJA ordinarily consult with victims and consider their
inputs concerning:


                1) a decision not to prefer charges;


                2) decisions concerning pretrial restraint of the alleged offender or the offender's release;


                3) pretrial dismissal of charges;


                4) negotiations of pretrial agreements and their potential terms;


                5) a discharge in lieu of court-martial; and


                6) a convening authority's decision to set aside findings or provide sentence relief?


7. Have effective procedures been established to ensure that victim and witness requests for notification
of case and prisoner status are recorded, properly acted upon and/or forwarded to the appropriate authori-
ties for action?


       a. Are victims provided the earliest possible post-trial notice of:


                1) consideration of the offender by the Air Force Clemency and Parole Board;

offender; and


                3) death of the offender, if occurring while in confinement?


       b. Are victims immediately notified of any post-trial appellate relief or clemency granted an
offender?


8. Are separate waiting areas provided for victims and prosecution witnesses at military justice proceed-
ings?

       d. Does the responsible official notify military and/or civilian law enforcement agencies, when
appropriate, of the need to take the measures necessary to provide reasonable protection for the victim or
witness?


10. After court proceedings, has appropriate action been taken to ensure the property of a victim or wit-
ness held as evidence is safeguarded and returned as expeditiously as possible.


11. Has the installation commander established an effective means of regularly evaluating the quality of
the victim and witness assistance program?
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                       125


                                               Chapter 8

                                          TRIAL MATTERS

Section 8A—Changes to and Withdrawal of Charges and Specifications after Referral to Trial

8.1. Changes. Minor and major changes may be made to charges and/or specifications after referral as
authorized and explained in RCM 603. Changes should be made by lining through the material while
ensuring the form remains legible. All changes and modifications should be initialed. Do not use
white-out tape or liquid for minor or major changes.
   8.1.1. Minor Changes. Make minor changes to a charge and/or specification on the Charge Sheet.
   Initial and date the change. Minor changes may be accomplished without having the charge sworn
   anew by the accuser. Promptly provide copies of the Charge Sheet with the changes to the accused and
   defense counsel. After arraignment, only a military judge may authorize minor changes to the charge
   sheet.
   8.1.2. Major Changes. Major changes or amendments to a charge and/or specification cannot be
   made over the objection of the accused unless the charge and/or specification affected are preferred
   anew. A new referral will also be necessary and, in the case of a general court-martial, a new Article
   32 investigation will be required if the charge and/or specification, as changed, was not covered in the
   prior investigation.
       8.1.2.1. Make a major change or amendment to a charge and/or specification on the original
       Charge Sheet. Initial and date the change. If the accused objects to the change, a new preferral and
       referral of the changed or amended charge and/or specification must be accomplished by attaching
       an indorsement to the original Charge Sheet containing the following matters: a new preferral,
       notification to the accused, receipt by summary court-martial convening authority, referral, and
       service under RCM 602.
       8.1.2.2. Even if an accused does not object to a major change or amendment, it may be prudent to
       prefer anew. Re-preferral and re-referral may avoid a jurisdictional issue as to whether the accused
       was improperly tried for a charge never referred to trial by the convening authority in an actual
       order or functional equivalent. United States v. Wilkins, 29 M.J. 421 (C.M.A. 1990).

8.2. Withdrawal. Before findings are announced, a convening authority may cause any charges or spec-
ifications to be withdrawn from a court-martial. RCM 604. Withdrawal of charges or specifications extin-
guishes the jurisdiction of a court-martial over them, unlike a dismissal that extinguishes the charges
themselves. Withdrawn charges and/or specifications should be disposed of promptly (e.g., dismissed,
re-referred to another court-martial, or forwarded to another convening authority for disposition). An
officer authorized to sign referrals or trial counsel may withdraw charges and/or specifications at the
direction of the convening authority.
   8.2.1. Complete Withdrawal. To withdraw all charges and specifications from a court-martial, line
   through the referral section (Part V) of the Charge Sheet, specify the disposition and the date, and ini-
   tial the action taken (e.g., “Withdrawn on 15 Sep 03, [initials]”). If the convening authority directs
   both withdrawal and dismissal of all charges and specifications, reflect accordingly (e.g., “Withdrawn
   and Dismissed on 15 Sep 03, [initials]”).
126                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


      8.2.2. Partial Withdrawal. To withdraw a specific charge and/or specification from a court-martial,
      while allowing the other offense(s) to proceed to trial, line through the affected charge and/or specifi-
      cation, specify the disposition and the date, and initial the action taken. (e.g., “Withdrawn on 15 Sep
      03, [initials]”). If the convening authority directs both withdrawal and dismissal of a particular charge
      and/or specification, reflect accordingly (e.g. “Withdrawn and Dismissed on 15 Sep 03, [initials]”).
      The trial counsel must determine whether any remaining charges and/or specifications should be
      renumbered (and if renumbered, initial the renumbering). The following rules apply to renumbering
      charges and/or specifications:
         8.2.2.1. When charges and/or specifications are withdrawn before arraignment, the remaining
         charges and/or specifications must be renumbered and the new numbers reflected on the charge
         sheet and throughout the ROT.
         8.2.2.2. When charges and/or specifications are withdrawn after arraignment and after they have
         come to the attention of court members (or the military judge sitting alone), the remaining charges
         and/or specifications should not be renumbered. The military judge instructs the members that the
         withdrawn charges and/or specifications should not be considered for any reason.
         8.2.2.3. When charges and/or specifications are withdrawn after arraignment but before the court
         members are aware of the charges, the remaining charges and/or specifications should, at the
         direction of the military judge, be renumbered. The new numbers should be reflected on the
         charge sheet and referred to throughout the ROT from the point of renumbering. If the military
         judge directs renumbering, withdrawn charges and/or specifications should not be brought to the
         attention of the members. If the military judge does not direct renumbering, the remaining charges
         and/or specifications should not be renumbered and the military judge instructs the members that
         they should not draw any inference from the numbering of the charges and/or specifications.

Section 8B—Conditional Guilty Plea

8.3. Conditional Guilty Plea. RCM 910(a)(2); United States v. Monroe, 50 M.J. 550 (A.F. Ct. Crim.
App. 1999) and United States v. Phillips, 32 M.J. 955 (A.F.C.M.R. 1991). When approving a guilty plea
conditioned on preserving review of an adverse determination of a pretrial motion, the military judge
should make the following findings on the record: (1) the offer is in writing and clearly details the motion
that the accused wishes to preserve on appeal; (2) the government's consent is in writing and signed by an
official authorized to consent; (3) the particular motion was fully litigated before the military judge; and,
(4) the motion is case dispositive. The SJA or Acting SJA to the convening authority, or the trial counsel
at the direction of the SJA or Acting SJA, is authorized to consent for the government to the accused
entering a conditional guilty plea.

Section 8C—Pretrial Agreements (RCM 705)

8.4. Policy Considerations. Use caution whenever a pretrial agreement (PTA) is being considered. A
PTA is appropriate when there are benefits to the government and the accused. PTAs should not be entered
into by the government solely for expediency, i.e. to dispose of a case quickly with minimal consideration
for the consequences of the agreement.
      8.4.1. PTAs that would include a provision for waiver of mandatory forfeitures must be carefully
      scrutinized to ensure the accused’s expectations will be met. For example, when an accused enters a
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                         127


   no-pay status upon the expiration of his or her term of service, there will be no pay available to forfeit,
   and therefore no amount to waive for the benefit of dependents. An agreement predicated upon terms
   including a waiver that is thwarted due to no pay entitlement may render pleas by an accused improv-
   ident and result in reversal of a conviction. United States v. Mitchell, 58 M.J. 251 (2003); United
   States v. Perron, 58 M.J. 78 (2003).
   8.4.2. Defense Offer. The SJA, trial counsel, and counsel for the accused may clarify the terms of a
   defense PTA offer to obtain sufficient information to enable the convening authority to decide whether
   to reject the offer or request permission to negotiate.

8.5. Authorization Required To Enter into PTA Discussion in National Security and Related Cases.
   8.5.1. In General. The Chief, Military Justice Division (AFLOA/JAJM), must grant permission to
   enter into PTA discussions in cases involving an offense (including attempt, conspiracy, and solicita-
   tion to commit such an offense) of espionage, subversion, aiding the enemy, sabotage, spying, or vio-
   lation of punitive rules or regulations and criminal statutes concerning classified information or the
   foreign relations of the United States. AFLOA/JAJM ensures coordination with DOJ according to
   DoD Directive 5525.7 (MCM, Appendix 3). AFLOA/JAJM permission is not required for the conven-
   ing authority to reject a PTA offer.
   8.5.2. Request for Permission to Negotiate. The GCMCA personally or through his or her SJA
   requests permission to negotiate a possible PTA from AFLOA/JAJM by the most expeditious means
   available. Include the following information in the request:
       8.5.2.1. Background information on the accused including name, rank and organization;
       8.5.2.2. The offenses charged;
       8.5.2.3. A summary of evidence against the accused;
       8.5.2.4. Terms of the accused's PTA offer; and,
       8.5.2.5. Factors warranting a PTA.
   8.5.3. Permission to Proceed. A grant of permission to enter into PTA discussions does not amount
   to approval of the terms or conditions of any PTA, which may result from the negotiations.

8.6. Authority to Conclude Agreement. Unless withheld by a superior authority, GCMCAs and SPCM-
CAs are authorized to enter into or reject offers to enter into PTAs with the accused. The decision to
accept or reject a PTA offer submitted by an accused is within the sole discretion of the convening author-
ity that referred the case to trial. United States v. Caruth, 6 M.J. 184 (C.M.A. 1979). The accused is enti-
tled to have the convening authority personally act upon the offer before trial. United States v. Upchurch,
23 M.J. 501 (A.F.C.M.R. 1986).

8.7. Terms and Format. See RCM 705(b) and (c) for terms and conditions which may be in a PTA. PTAs
must be in writing and signed by the accused and counsel. When a convening authority accepts a PTA, the
convening authority personally signs it, unless the convening authority previously authorized another
individual such as the SJA or trial counsel to sign. If the SJA or trial counsel signs the PTA, use an author-
ity line such as "FOR THE COMMANDER." Oral PTAs are prohibited, as are promises to intervene on
the accused's behalf in any manner in exchange for a guilty plea. Include all documentation pertaining to
a PTA, including Appendix A, changes, or modifications, in the ROT. Figure 8.1. is a sample PTA, but it
128                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


may be modified to fit the circumstances of a case. However, modification of Figure 8.1. should be
undertaken very cautiously; the sample language reflects generally required and legally acceptable agree-
ment terms.
      8.7.1. Changes in PTA. If the negotiation results in an agreement for different relief for the accused
      than such included in the original offer, prepare and sign a different offer and/or Appendix A reflect-
      ing the agreed terms. If only a new Appendix A is prepared, the date of the original offer will still
      appear in the first paragraph of Appendix A. If another Appendix A or offer is prepared, attach the
      original Appendix A or offer to the ROT as an allied paper.
      8.7.2. Stipulations of Fact. In order to make members and the military judge, when sitting alone,
      sufficiently aware of the circumstances of the offenses with which an accused is charged, the conven-
      ing authority may require the accused and counsel to enter into stipulations of fact or testimony as a
      part of the PTA. RCM 705(c)(2)(A).

8.8. Withdrawal from PTAs. Either party may withdraw from a PTA as provided in RCM 705(d)(4).
Withdrawals by the convening authority must be in writing and signed by the convening authority. Give a
copy to the accused and defense counsel. Withdrawals by the accused should be in writing and given to
the SJA or trial counsel. The PTA and the withdrawal, by either side, should be included in the ROT as a
pretrial allied paper. AFMAN 51-203, Figure 4.1.
      8.8.1. Post-Trial Matters. If the accused does not fulfill a promise to conform his or her conduct to
      certain conditions before action or during any period of suspension of the sentence, as agreed to in the
      PTA, the convening authority may be relieved of the obligation to fulfill the PTA. However, the
      accused’s promise must be included in the PTA and there must be compliance with the hearing
      requirements in RCM 1109 before an alleged violation by the accused may relieve the convening
      authority of the obligation to fulfill the agreement. RCM 705(c)(2)(D); United States v. Smith, 46 M.J.
      263 (1997).

8.9. In-Court Inquiry. Notify the military judge of a PTA before arraignment. The military judge must
question the accused prior to accepting the plea to determine whether the accused understands and agrees
to the meaning and effect of each PTA condition and the agreed upon sentence limitations. In a trial by
military judge alone, the military judge should not inquire into the actual sentence limitations specified in
the plea agreement until after sentence announcement. PTAs that are subject to in-court inquiry, whether
or not accepted by the military judge, are appellate exhibits in the ROT. See RCM 705(e) for PTA nondis-
closure requirements.

Section 8D—Evidentiary Matters

8.10. Confidential Drug or Alcohol Abuse Records. Federal statutes and regulations restrict the dis-
closure of records as to the identity, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment of drug and alcohol abusers under
the Federal drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs. Refer to 42 U.S.C. § 290dd-2 and 42 CFR §
2.12.
      8.10.1. Although the interchange of records entirely within the Armed Forces are exempt from the
      prohibitions in paragraph 8.10., the Department of Defense adopted the standards as a matter of policy
      to the extent it provides such records may not be used to initiate or substantiate any criminal charges
      against the rehabilitant, except as authorized by a court order issued under 42 U.S.C. § 290dd-2 and as
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                           129


   allowed in AFI 44-120, Drug Abuse Testing Program, (implementing DoDD 1010.1, Military Person-
   nel Drug Abuse Testing Program).
   8.10.2. Disclosure of these records is permitted at the request of, and with written consent of, the
   accused-patient:
       8.10.2.1. As evidence for the defense before findings.
       8.10.2.2. As evidence in mitigation or extenuation in pre-sentencing proceedings.
       8.10.2.3. After trial in support of clemency or clemency petitions to TJAG or SECAF.
   8.10.3. Follow the procedure outlined in 42 C.F.R. § 2.31 in authorizing release of the records by the
   accused-patient. Avoid discussion of the records in open court to the extent feasible.
   8.10.4. Only release necessary and relevant portions of the records for purposes of paragraph 8.10.2.
   An accused cannot selectively authorize disclosure of the records to mislead the court or other parties
   to the trial (e.g., disclosing favorable early records, but not later ones indicating regression). If there is
   reason to believe an accused is selectively authorizing disclosure, either resolve the matters among
   counsel, or by an in camera review of the records by the military judge.
   8.10.5. Drug and alcohol abuse records may be disclosed at trial without the consent of the accused to
   rebut or impeach evidence presented by the accused. United States v. Evans, 20 M.J. 504 (A.F.C.M.R.
   1985); United States v. Fenyo, 6 M.J. 933 (A.F.C.M.R. 1979), pet. denied, 7 M.J. 161 (C.M.A. 1979).

8.11. Psychotherapist-Patient Confidentiality. When psychotherapist-patient communications are
involved, consult the psychotherapist-patient privilege under MRE 513 and, when applicable, the eviden-
tiary protections and limitations extended to an accused entered in the Limited Privilege Suicide Preven-
tion Program (LPSP) under AFI 44-109, Mental Health, Confidentiality, and Military Law.
   8.11.1. MRE 513 is a limited evidentiary privilege protecting confidential communications between a
   patient and a psychotherapist, or an assistant to a psychotherapist, if the communications were made
   for the purpose of facilitating diagnosis or treatment of the patient’s mental or emotional condition. It
   applies only to communications made after 1 November 1999. While the privilege broadly applies to
   all “patients,” including military members, the privilege is narrowed by eight exceptions enumerated
   in the rule. If an exception applies, no privilege under the rule exists to preclude disclosure.
   8.11.2. MRE 513 provides that the privilege applies only to “case[s] arising under the UCMJ.” It
   extends to all stages of a proceeding under the UCMJ, including law enforcement investigations into
   suspected offenses, proceedings for search authorizations, nonjudicial punishment proceedings,
   court-martial actions, and other proceedings enumerated in MRE 1101. MRE 513 has no application
   outside such UCMJ proceedings. As stated in the MCM’s Analysis to this rule, “there is no intent to
   apply Rule 513 in any proceeding other than those authorized under the UCMJ. . . . Rule 513 applies
   only to UCMJ proceedings, and do[es] not limit the availability of such information internally to the
   services, for appropriate purposes.” MCM, Appendix 22.
   8.11.3. Therefore, the MRE 513 privilege has no application if access to the confidential communica-
   tions between a military member and a psychotherapist is sought for a non-UCMJ-related purpose. In
   these situations, confidential communications should be disclosed to persons or agencies with a
   proper and legitimate need for the information and authorized by law or regulation to receive them.
   When UCMJ proceedings are pending against the member whose confidential communications are
   being sought for a non-UCMJ-related purpose, no privilege applies.
130                                                            AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


      8.11.4. Disputes between a requestor and a psychotherapist or patient may arise over the disclosure of
      confidential communications. AFI 44-109 has established procedures that address this issue. The
      installation SJA is authorized to resolve the dispute and determine whether disclosure should be made.
      When the request is for non-UCMJ purposes, the focus should be on whether the requestor has a
      proper and legitimate need for the confidential communications and is authorized by law or regulation
      to receive them. When the request seeks disclosure for UCMJ purposes, the SJA’s focus should be on
      whether an enumerated exception in MRE 513 authorizes disclosure. The SJA, in UCMJ cases, must
      guard against improper disclosures to investigators and trial counsel that may “poison the case” with
      inadmissible evidence.
      8.11.5. The MRE 513 privilege also interacts with the protections afforded members in the LPSP Pro-
      gram. Confidential communications of members in the LPSP program cannot be used against them in
      a UCMJ action, even if an exception in MRE 513 applies. Members may be entered into the program
      once they are officially notified that they are either under investigation or suspected of committing an
      offense under the UCMJ.

8.12. Confidentiality of Sexual Assault Protected Program Records. When communications between
a victim of sexual assault and a Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC) and/or Victim Advocate
(VA) are involved, consult the confidential reporting program for victims of sexual assault established by
DoDD 6495.01, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program, and Department of the Air
Force Policies and Procedures for the Prevention of and Response to Sexual Assault.
      8.12.1. Restricted reporting allows a sexual assault victim to confidentially disclose the details of his
      or her assault to specified individuals and receive medical treatment and counseling, without trigger-
      ing the official investigative process. Service members who are sexually assaulted and desire
      restricted reporting under this policy may only report the assault to the SARC, VA or a HCP. In cases
      where a victim elects restricted reporting, the SARC, assigned VA (whether uniformed or civilian),
      and HCPs may not disclose covered communications to law enforcement or command authorities,
      either within or outside the Department of Defense, except as provided by the DoDI and/or AF Policy.
      8.12.2. The disclosure will be limited to information necessary to satisfy the purpose of the disclosure
      in the event an authorized disclosure is made.
      8.12.3. Disclosure may be made to:
         8.12.3.1. Command officials or law enforcement (including SF and AFOSI or other criminal
         investigative service) when the disclosure is authorized in writing by the victim;
         8.12.3.2. Command officials or law enforcement when disclosure is necessary to prevent or
         lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of the individual or another;
         8.12.3.3. Disability Retirement Boards and officials when disclosure by a healthcare provider is
         required for fitness for duty for disability retirement determinations, limited to only that informa-
         tion which is necessary to process the disability retirement determination;
         8.12.3.4. SARC, VAs or healthcare provider when disclosure is necessary for the supervision of
         direct victim services;
         8.12.3.5. Military or civilian courts of competent jurisdiction when disclosure is ordered by a mil-
         itary, Federal, or State judge, or other officials or entities as required by a Federal or State statute
         or applicable U.S. international agreement.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                         131


   8.12.4. The SARC, assigned VA, and healthcare providers will consult with the servicing legal office,
   in the same manner as other recipients of privileged information, to determine if the exception criteria
   apply. Until those determinations are made, only non-identifying information should be disclosed.
   When there is uncertainty or disagreement on whether an exception applies, the matter shall be
   brought to the attention of the senior commander for decision.

Section 8E—Pre-sentencing Matters (RCM 1001)

8.13. Personal Data and Character of Prior Service. "Personnel records of the accused," as referenced
in RCM 1001, includes all those records made or maintained in accordance with Air Force directives that
reflect the past military efficiency, conduct, performance, and history of the accused, as well as any evi-
dence of disciplinary actions, including punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, and previous court-martial
convictions.
   8.13.1. Personnel Information File. Relevant material contained in an accused's unit personnel
   information file (PIF) may be admitted pursuant to RCM 1001(b) if:
       8.13.1.1. Counsel provided a copy of the document or made the document available to opposing
       counsel prior to trial; and
       8.13.1.2. There is some evidence on the document or attached to it that:
           8.13.1.2.1. The accused received a copy of the correspondence (a document bearing the signa-
           ture of the accused, or a witnessed statement regarding the accused's refusal to sign, would
           meet this criterion) and had the opportunity to respond to the allegation; and,
           8.13.1.2.2. The document is not over 5 years old on the date the charges were referred to trial.
       8.13.1.3. Relevant material contained in an accused's PIF may be admitted under RCM 1001(d)
       for rebuttal purposes, even if it does not comply with 8.13.1.2.1. and 8.13.1.2.2., if, in the military
       judge's discretion, other competent means of authenticating the material have been presented to
       the court. United States v. Strong, 17 M.J. 263 (C.M.A. 1984).
   8.13.2. Nonjudicial Punishment. Records of punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, from any file in
   which the record is properly maintained by regulation, may be admitted if not over 5 years old on the
   date the charges were referred. Measure this time period from the date the commander notified the
   accused of the commander's intent to impose nonjudicial punishment. Exclude periods in which the
   accused is absent without authority in computing the 5-year period. If the PIF contains an AF Form
   366, Record of Proceedings of Vacation of Suspended Nonjudicial Punishment, which meets this
   five-year requirement, a copy of the Article 15 record imposing the punishment vacated is also admis-
   sible, regardless of whether the original Article 15 action was served on the accused within this time
   period. Nothing in this paragraph precludes use of Article 15 actions over five years old as rebuttal
   evidence pursuant to RCM 1001(d).
   8.13.3. Performance Reports. Trial counsel offers all Enlisted or Officer Performance Reports
   maintained according to departmental directives, as evidence of the character of the accused's prior
   service. RCM 1001(b)(2); United States v. Wingart, 27 M.J. 128 (C.M.A. 1988).
   8.13.4. Previous Convictions. The DD Form 493, Extract of Military Records of Previous Convic-
   tions, may be used to introduce evidence of an accused's previous conviction. Do not offer evidence of
   a previous conviction by SCM, in which counsel did not represent the accused, unless the accused
132                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


      waived the right to counsel. United States v. Booker, 5 M.J. 238, 246 (C.M.A. 1977). A conviction by
      SCM is not admissible until reviewed pursuant to Article 64(a), UCMJ. See also RCM 1001(b)(3).

8.14. Hate Crimes. Trial counsel may present evidence in aggravation that the accused intentionally
selected a victim or any property as the object of the offense because of the actual or perceived race, color,
religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual orientation of any person. RCM
1001(b)(4).

Section 8F—Matters Requiring Air Force Legal Operations Agency Assistance

8.15. Appeals by the United States from an Adverse Ruling by a Military Judge (RCM 908).
      8.15.1. Trial counsel may file a notice of appeal by the United States under Article 62, UCMJ, and
      RCM 908 only after consultation with the Government Trial and Appellate Counsel Division
      (AFLOA/JAJG). The SJA decides whether to file such notice of appeal with the convening authority's
      concurrence.
      8.15.2. After filing a notice of appeal conforming to the requirements of RCM 908(b) with the mili-
      tary judge, trial counsel sends notice to AFLOA/JAJG within 20 days, requesting that office file the
      appeal with the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (AFCCA). In the request, identify the ruling or
      order to be appealed and include the following:
         8.15.2.1. A copy of the charges and specifications;
         8.15.2.2. An original and two copies of the verbatim record of the applicable proceedings, or, if
         not available, a summary of the evidence and facts;
         8.15.2.3. Trial counsel's certification that the appeal is not taken to delay the case;
         8.15.2.4. Trial counsel's certification that, if the order or ruling excludes evidence, the excluded
         evidence is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding; and
         8.15.2.5. A memorandum opinion on the law applicable to the issues appealed, including an
         explanation why the issues appealed are significant enough to require appeal by the United States.
      8.15.3. AFLOA/JAJG decides whether to file the appeal with AFCCA, and notifies the trial counsel
      and SJA.

8.16. Extraordinary Writs by Government Counsel. A petition for extraordinary relief by the prose-
cution in a court-martial is, and should remain, a rare course of action.

8.17. Officer Resignations for the Good of the Service (RILOs). SPCMCAs, GCMCAs and MAJ-
COM commanders are authorized to deny RILOs submitted prior to the referral of charges. If denied, the
officer may again submit a RILO after referral of charges. Once referral of charges occurs, RILOs may
only be acted upon at the Secretarial level. A RILO may not be submitted post-arraignment.
      8.17.1. Procedure. Forward all pre-referral RILOs, in which approval is recommended, and all
      post-referral officer RILOs expeditiously to AFLOA/JAJM through the command channels outlined
      in AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers, chapter 2, section 2C.
         8.17.1.1. Forward the original and two copies of the RILO package. Base legal offices should also
         determine whether AFPC and MAJCOM reviewing authorities will need additional copies of the
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                      133


     RILO package. In addition to the officer's resignation and any supporting documents submitted by
     the officer, the RILO package should include (as applicable) copies of:
         8.17.1.1.1. Any reports of investigation, statements, or other documents supporting the
         charges or accusations against the officer;
         8.17.1.1.2. The charge sheet, forwarding letters and any indorsements with attachments,
         including the personal data sheet on the officer;
         8.17.1.1.3. The report of the Article 32 investigation with attachments;
         8.17.1.1.4. Recommendations on disposition of the RILO from each commander required to
         review the RILO; and
         8.17.1.1.5. A comprehensive legal review from the base level (or equivalent) legal office
         where the RILO originated.
     8.17.1.2. Documents submitted by the defense after the original submission of the resignation
     package will be considered at the discretion of the recommendation and decision authorities.
     8.17.1.3. Written legal reviews are not required at intermediate levels of command between the
     originating legal office and AFLOA/JAJM, unless an intermediate level legal office disagrees
     with a lower level legal review or needs to add and discuss omitted matters. Otherwise, written
     coordination indicating concurrence is all that is required. MAJCOMs may require additional
     legal reviews if they desire.
     8.17.1.4. Do not delay processing court-martial charges through referral solely because a RILO is
     pending.
  8.17.2. Requests to Proceed to Trial Pending Action on Officer Resignation. Prior authorization
  from AFLOA/JAJM is required before proceeding to trial in all officer cases in which action on a
  RILO is pending. For purposes of this paragraph, the start of trial is defined as the acceptance of pleas
  at arraignment. In the request to proceed, include justification why the trial should proceed before a
  decision on the resignation. See AFI 36-3207. If permission to proceed is granted, do not, under any
  circumstances, prepare a convening authority action before SECAF issues a decision on the resigna-
  tion. A Request to Proceed is not required to conduct pre-arraignment preliminary sessions pursuant
  to Article 39(a)(1), (2) and (4), UCMJ, including conducting evidentiary hearings and other motions
  which may help expeditiously process the case in the interests of judicial economy.
  8.17.3. Seven Day Rule for RILOs. Do not proceed to trial in any officer case with a RILO pending
  without prior authorization from JAJM. AFLOA/JAJM will normally approve requests to proceed to
  trial while a RILO is pending, if the RILO is submitted more than seven calendar days after service of
  charges on the accused under RCM 602. In those cases, the only justification necessary in the request
  to proceed to trial is the untimely submission of the RILO, but additional reasons may be submitted if
  they exist. If a RILO is submitted within seven days of service of charges under RCM 602, requests to
  proceed to trial pending action on the RILO will normally be disapproved by AFLOA/JAJM absent
  compelling circumstances warranting trial while the RILO is pending. RILO processing should not be
  stopped or delayed, nor should the RILO be rejected for processing, based solely upon the time sub-
  mitted unless submitted post-arraignment. All timely RILOs must be forwarded through channels for
  Secretarial action, even if submitted more than seven days after service of charges under RCM 602.
134                                                          AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


8.18. Classified or Controlled Information. Special procedures and requirements apply in cases where
classified information may be used as evidence. In all such cases, contact AFLOA/JAJM as soon as pos-
sible for guidance on how to proceed.
      8.18.1. Asserting the MRE 505 Privilege. Only SECAF, or the head of a government agency for
      documents owned by agencies outside the Air Force, may claim the privilege from disclosure of clas-
      sified information (MRE 505). A person who may claim the privilege may authorize a witness or trial
      counsel to claim the privilege on his or her behalf. Forward requests for assertion of the privilege to
      AFLOA/JAJM.
      8.18.2. Classified Material in the Record. When a ROT contains classified material, declassify the
      material when proper. If it is impossible to declassify the material, the record must be classified. In
      determining whether a particular ROT must be classified because of its content, consideration should
      be given to DOD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program, and AFI 31-401, Information Security
      Program Management. See AFMAN 51-203, Chapter 6, for additional guidance.
      8.18.3. Controlled Material in the Record. When a ROT contains controlled material (e.g., promo-
      tion testing materials, PME test materials, CDC EOC Exams, etc.), safeguard the materials to prevent
      further disclosure or unauthorized access. See AFMAN 51-203, Chapter 6, for additional guidance.

8.19. Disclosure of Government Information other than Classified Information. Immediately notify
AFLOA/JAJM if a case involves assertion of the privilege against disclosure of government information
(MRE 506).

Section 8G—Trial by Military Judge

8.20. Requesting Trial by Military Judge. To request a trial by military judge alone, the accused should
use the DD Form 1722, Request for Trial Before Military Judge Alone. If the DD Form 1722 is used, it
must be included in the ROT as an appellate exhibit. AFMAN 51-203, Figure 4.1. Refer to RCM 903 for
additional guidance.

Section 8H—Use of Audiovisual and Teleconferencing Technology

8.21. The use of audiovisual and teleconferencing technology is authorized by SECAF to the extent and
under the conditions allowed for in RCM 804(b), 805(a), 805(c), and 914B.

Section 8I—Findings and Sentencing Worksheets

8.22. Use of Findings and Sentencing Worksheets. The following forms may be used to assist court
members put court-martial findings and sentences in the format required by the Manual for Court-Martial:
      8.22.1. AF Form 1092, Court-Martial Findings Worksheet.
         8.22.1.1. Where a specification against a service member alleges wrongful acts on “divers occa-
         sions,” trial counsel should request members be instructed that any findings made by exceptions
         and substitutions that remove the “divers occasions” language should clearly reflect the specific
         instance of conduct upon which the modified findings are based. Such changes can generally be
         accomplished through reference in the substituted language to a relevant date or other facts in evi-
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                135


     dence that will clearly put the accused and the reviewing court on notice of what conduct served
     as the basis for the finding. United States v. Waters, 58 MJ 391 (CAAF 2003).
  8.22.2. AF Form 1093, Sentence Worksheet (Special Court-Martial).
  8.22.3. AF Form 835, Sentence Worksheet (General Court-Martial).

ORGANIZATION




                                 OFFER FOR PRETRIAL AGREEMENT


        I, (grade, name, SSN) , am presently the accused under court-martial charges, dated
_______________ (and__________ ). I have read the charge(s) and specification(s) alleged against me,
and they have been explained to me by my defense counsel, (rank, if military, and name). I understand the
charge(s) and specification(s), and I am aware I have a legal and moral right to plead not guilty and to
leave the prosecution with the burden of proving my guilt beyond a reasonable doubt by legal and compe-
tent evidence. Understanding the above and under the conditions set forth below, and in consideration of
agreement by the convening authority to approve a sentence in accord with the limitations set forth in
Appendix A, (I offer to waive my right to a trial by members and I will elect to be tried by military judge
alone) (and to) (withdraw Charge ______________, Specification _______) (modify Specification
______________ of Charge ___________ to the lesser offense of ___________) (refer the case to a spe-
cial court-martial), I offer to plead Guilty


       To all Charges and Specifications
             or
       To the Charge and Specification(s)
             or
        To the following Charge(s) and Specification(s): (set forth by number or in full the charge(s) and
specification(s) to which the guilty plea will apply. If the plea is to be a lesser included offense as to one
or more specifications, set forth the exceptions and substitutions correctly and in full. MCM, Appendix
10.


        I understand that this offer, when accepted by the convening authority, constitutes a binding agree-
ment. I assert that I am, in fact, guilty of the offense(s) to which I am offering to plead guilty, and I under-
stand that this agreement permits the government to avoid presentation in court of sufficient evidence to
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                           137


prove my guilt. I offer to plead guilty because it will be in my best interest that the convening authority
grant me the relief set forth above and in Appendix A. I understand that I waive my right to a trial of the
facts and to be confronted by the witnesses against me, and my right to avoid self-incrimination insofar as
a plea of guilty will incriminate me.


          In making this offer, I state that:


       1. I am satisfied with the defense counsel who advised me with respect to this offer and consider
(him) (her) (them) competent to represent me in this court-martial.


          2. No person or persons made any attempt to force or coerce me into making this offer or to plead
guilty.


        3. My counsel fully advised me of the nature of the charges against me, the possibility of my
defending against them, any defense which might apply, and the effect of the guilty plea which I am offer-
ing to make, and I fully understand (his) (her) advice and the meaning, effect, and consequences of this
plea.


       4. I understand the signature of the convening authority to this offer and to Appendix A, or to any
modified version of Appendix A which I also sign, will transform this offer into an agreement binding
upon me and the Government.


        5. I understand that I may withdraw my plea of guilty at any time before sentence but not after sen-
tence is announced and that, if I do so, this agreement is canceled and of no effect. This agreement will
also be canceled and of no effect, if any of the following occurs:


              a. Refusal of the court to accept my plea of guilty, as set forth above, or modification of the
plea by anyone during the trial to not guilty or to a lesser degree of guilt.


                  b. Withdrawal by either party to the agreement before the trial.


                  c. My failure to agree with the trial counsel on stipulations concerning facts and circum-
stances.


                  (d. My failure to request or the court’s refusal to grant my request to be tried by military
judge alone.)

         6. I understand the convening authority's obligation to approve a sentence no greater than that pro-
vided in Appendix A to this agreement may be canceled after a hearing following the guidelines in RCM
1109, if I commit any offense chargeable under the UCMJ between the announcement of sentence and the
convening authority's approval of any sentence (or fail to provide restitution to ___________ in the
amount of _________ by __________) (fail to return __________ to ___________ by ___________)
(fail to refrain from _____________ between the announcement of sentence and the convening authority's
approval of any sentence) (________________________). (See note 1.)


        7. I understand that if this agreement is canceled for any reason stated above, this offer for an
agreement cannot be used against me in any way or at any time to establish my guilt of the offense(s), and
the limitations upon disposition of my case set forth in Appendix A will have no effect.


       This document and Appendix A include all of the terms of this pretrial agreement, and no other
inducements have been made by the convening authority or any other person which affect my offer to
plead guilty.

NOTES:
  1. The clauses contained in paragraph 6 of this figure are optional. If used, carefully tailor them to
     include adequate protections against arbitrary revocation of the agreement to prevent their being
     declared void as against public policy. See United States v. Dawson, 10 M.J. 142 (C.M.A. 1982);
     United States v. Connell, 13 M.J. 156 (C.M.A. 1982); MCM, Appendix 21, Analysis, RCM
     705(c)(2)(D).
      2. The convening authority signs the Offer for Pretrial Agreement only if approving it and Appendix
         A.
      3. Overall sentence caps may be confusing. If the parties wish to cap the sentence in the aggregate
         (allowing substitution of punishments for those specifically adjudged, so long as the aggregate
         effect does not exceed the aggregate adjudged), the pretrial agreement should be specific on this
         point. Otherwise, to avoid confusion, consider using the following language when limiting more
         than one form of the punishment: "He will approve no punitive discharge, if one is adjudged,
         more severe than a Bad Conduct Discharge; he will approve no confinement, if confinement is
         adjudged, in excess of [state time in months or years]; he will approve no forfeiture with a
         monthly amount in excess of $500 per month, nor a number of months in excess of 36 months.
         There are no restrictions on his ability to approve other forms of punishment that may be
         adjudged."
      4. See paragraph 8.8.2.
      5. The convening authority signs Appendix A only if approving it and the Offer for Pretrial Agree-
         ment.

                                                Chapter 9

                                     POST-TRIAL PROCEDURE

Section 9A—Report of the Result of Trial (RCM 1101; RCM 1305).

9.1. Publication of Result of Trial. Publish the result of trial on an AF Form 1359, Report of Result of
Trial. Distribute the Report of Result of Trial to the accused’s immediate commander, the GCM and
SPCM convening authorities and their SJAs, the commander of the local SFS and AFOSI detachment,
and, if the accused is in confinement, to the commanding officer responsible for the confinement facility
and the confinement officer. Additional copies may be distributed as directed by the convening authority.
See paragraph 9.13.1. for additional guidance on preparing the AF Form 1359 and Section 9I for addi-
tional reporting requirements on the sentence. Include “Sex Offender Notification Required,” “DNA Pro-
cessing Required,” and/or “Crime of Domestic Violence” in the sentence block of the AF Form 1359 if
applicable. See paragraphs 13.17. and 13.21. for more information.

Section 9B—Post-Trial Confinement

9.2. Entry into Post-Trial Confinement. Sentences to confinement run from the date adjudged, except
when suspended or deferred by the convening authority. Use the DD Form 2707, Confinement Order, to
enter an accused into post-trial confinement.
   9.2.1. Processing DD Form 2707.
       9.2.1.1. When a court-martial sentence includes confinement, the legal office should prepare the
       top portion of the DD Form 2707. The person directing confinement, typically the trial counsel,
       signs item 7(b). A judge advocate signs item 8(b) as the officer conducting a legal review and
       approval. The same person cannot sign both item 7(b) and 8(b). Before signing the legal review,
       the judge advocate should ensure the form is properly completed and the individual directing con-
       finement actually has authority to direct confinement.
       9.2.1.2. Unless limited by superior authority, the commander of the accused orders the accused
       into post-trial confinement. Commanders may delegate the authority to order post-trial confine-
       ment to the trial counsel or assistant trial counsel. See RCM 1101(b). A sample memorandum del-
       egating military justice administrative duties is at Figure 13.1.
       9.2.1.3. Security Forces personnel receipt for the prisoner by completing and signing item 11 of
       the DD Form 2707. The servicing legal office must retain a signed copy of the DD Form 2707.
       Security Forces personnel must ensure the prisoner receives a medical examination within 24
       hours or the next duty day after entry into confinement as required by AFI 31-205, The Air Force
       Corrections System, paragraph 5.3.2. Security Forces personnel ensure medical personnel com-
       plete items 9 and 10 of the DD Form 2707. Ensure a completed copy of DD Form 2707 is returned
       to the legal office for insertion in the ROT.
   9.2.2. If an accused is in pretrial confinement, no action is normally necessary to continue that con-
   finement. The AF Form 1359 may serve in lieu of the DD Form 2707. See AFI 31-205, paragraph 5.1.

9.3. Effect of Pretrial Confinement. An accused receives day-for-day credit for any pretrial confine-
ment served in military, civilian or foreign confinement facilities, for which the accused has not received
142                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


credit against any other sentence. United States v. Allen, 17 M.J. 126 (C.M.A. 1984), United States v. Mur-
ray, 43 M.J. 507 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 1995) and United States v. Pinson, 54 M.J. 692 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App.
2001). Annotate on AF Form 1359 and DD Form 2707 for any civilian and/or military pretrial confine-
ment credit.
      9.3.1. When a military judge directs credit for illegal pretrial confinement, this credit must be ordered
      in the convening authority's initial action (RCM 1107(f)(4)(F)), and should not be reflected on the AF
      Form 1359. See Figure 9.8.

9.4. Confinement Facility (RCM 1101; 1107(f)(4)(C); 1113(d)(2)(C)). HQ AFSFC/SFC oversees Air
Force correctional facilities worldwide, is responsible for inmates gained by HQ AFSFC/SFC (inmates
not ordered to serve sentences in local correctional facilities), and approves all inmate transfers between
military corrections facilities. HQ AFSFC/SFC, not the convening authority, selects the corrections facil-
ity for post-trial confinement and rehabilitation for inmates gained by HQ AFSFC/SFC. Refer to AFI
31-205, for confinement rules and practices.
      9.4.1. Correctional facilities other than those in the Air Force Corrections System may be used to
      confine inmates. HQ AFSFC/SFC sends detailed instructions covering selection of inmates for these
      assignments, details of transfer, and other administrative matters. The GCMCA over an inmate trans-
      ferred to such a facility exercises the same responsibilities as those assigned in this chapter to the
      Commander, Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), Bolling AFB, DC, for inmates in the Air
      Force Corrections System.

Section 9C—Preparing, Serving, and Forwarding Records of Trial

9.5. Preparing Records of Trial. Prepare court-martial records of trial (ROT) in accordance with RCM
1103, RCM 1305, MCM Appendices 13-15, and AFMAN 51-203, Records of Trial. Ensure ROTs are
authenticated in accordance with RCM 1104(a). See also AFMAN 51-203, chapter 12 and paragraph 10.3.

9.6. Serving Records of Trial. Serve the ROT on the accused in accordance with RCM 1104(b) or RCM
1305(d). Include proof of service, or substitute service, in the ROT.

9.7. Forwarding Records of Trial. Forward the ROT to the convening authority or his or her SJA, in
accordance with RCM 1104(e). After the convening authority takes action, promptly forward the original
ROT and required copies to AFLOA/JAJM using the most cost-effective method which provides a means
to track the ROT. Consult AFMAN 51-203, Chapters 3 and 13, for the number of required copies that
must accompany the original and for forwarding instructions.

Section 9D—Matters Submitted by the Accused and/or Defense Counsel (RCM 1105)

9.8. Notice Regarding Post-Trial Submissions. The SJA, trial counsel, or assistant trial counsel pro-
vides the accused and defense counsel a memorandum (Figure 9.1.) informing the accused of the right to
submit matters, including clemency matters, for the convening authority's consideration, and the time
period for making such submissions. Address the letter to the accused and provide a copy to the defense
counsel responsible for post-trial matters. If an SJA recommendation is not required in the case, provide
the letter to the detailed military defense counsel, unless the accused requested otherwise. Include a copy
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                      143


of the notification letter, with the accused's receipt, in the ROT as specified in AFMAN 51-203, paragraph
4.6 and Figure 4.1.
   9.8.1. Waiver of Accused’s Right to Submit Matters. If the accused submits a waiver of the right
   to submit matters, include the written waiver in the ROT. See Figure 9.2. and Figure 9.3.

9.9. Applications to Defer Sentence and Waive Required Forfeitures. Before action is taken on a
case, an accused may submit an application to the convening authority, through the servicing SJA, to defer
any adjudged and/or mandatory forfeiture of pay or allowances, reduction in grade, or service of a sen-
tence to confinement. See Articles 57(a)(2), 57a(a), and 58b(a)(1). If an accused has dependents, an appli-
cation may also be submitted to the convening authority, through the servicing SJA, to waive any
mandatory forfeiture of pay and allowances under Article 58b(b), for the benefit of the accused’s depen-
dents. Applications for deferral and/or waiver may be submitted through the servicing SJA any time after
the sentence is announced and before action by the convening authority. See also paragraphs 9.24.1. and
9.24.3. See Section 9G for additional guidance on deferring and waiving forfeitures of pay and allow-
ances.

9.10. RCM 1105 Submissions. An accused may submit matters, including clemency recommendations,
for the convening authority to consider before taking action on the case. See RCM 1105 for a discussion
on matters that may be submitted, waivers, and the appropriate time periods for submissions.

9.11. Requests for Entry in Return to Duty Program (RTDP). The RTDP offers selected enlisted per-
sonnel with exceptional potential the opportunity to return to active duty and have their punitive dis-
charge, if adjudged, remitted. Participants are provided with programs individually designed to address
their confining offenses and improve their conduct, attitude, and productivity for continued Air Force ser-
vice. The accused's defense counsel assists the accused in volunteering for the RTDP by obtaining and
submitting the appropriate paperwork to the convening authority. An eligible inmate who volunteered, but
was not approved by the convening authority for entry into the RTDP, may be eligible to apply for entry
to the Air Force Clemency and Parole Board. See AFI 31-205, paragraph 11.6, for additional guidance on
applications and requirements for entry in the RTDP.

Section 9E—Staff Judge Advocate Recommendation and Addendum (RCM 1106)

9.12. Mandatory Recommendation. A Staff Judge Advocate's Recommendation (SJAR) is required in
cases where the convening authority takes action on a ROT by general court-martial or a ROT by special
court-martial that includes a sentence to a bad conduct discharge or confinement for one year or more.
   9.12.1. An SJAR is not required when the convening authority takes action on a ROT in a summary
   court-martial or special court-martial that does not include either a sentence to a bad conduct dis-
   charge or confinement for one year. In these cases, the SJA should provide the convening authority
   with the ROT, the defense submission, a memorandum to be signed by the convening authority
   acknowledging that he or she considered the defense submissions, and a proposed action for the con-
   vening authority’s signature. When an SJAR is not required, the action may be forwarded using the
   sample action memorandum provided in Figure 9.4. If there is a need to address new matter, use an
   SJAR/addendum instead of the action memorandum. Serve new matters on the accused and accused's
   counsel and allow 10 days from service to submit comments. See RCM 1106(f)(7)
144                                                          AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


9.13. SJAR Format. An SJAR should be a clear and concise recommendation written in memorandum
format containing the information required by RCM 1106(d). Attach copies of the AF Form 1359, and the
personal data sheet of the accused admitted at trial (see Figure 3.6.) to the SJAR. See sample format at
Figure 9.5.
      9.13.1. The AF Form 1359 is the primary source of findings and sentence information. Therefore, this
      form must be filled out completely and accurately, including offenses, pleas, findings and sentence.
      The form must accurately reflect findings of guilty to lesser included offenses and pleas or findings
      with exceptions and/or substitutions. The sentence portion of the AF Form 1359 should include both
      the sentence announced as well as the PTA sentence limitation.
         9.13.1.1. Ensure specifications which have pleas and findings with exceptions and/or substitu-
         tions are entered verbatim, not simply summarized.
      9.13.2. When combined with the SJAR and AF Form 1359, the personal data sheet ensures that all
      information required by RCM 1106(d)(3)(C) is provided to the convening authority.
      9.13.3. Include the original SJAR with all attachments (AF Form 1359 and the personal data sheet) in
      the original ROT. The attachments must follow immediately behind the SJAR in the ROT, even if
      these documents are also included in other parts of the record. Place a copy of the SJAR and attach-
      ments in each copy of the ROT.
      9.13.4. The SJAR must include items required by RCM 1106 that are not included on the personal
      data sheet or the AF Form 1359. This includes a description of the character of the accused's service
      prior to the charges (RCM 1106(d)(3)(C)), any clemency recommendations made by the sentencing
      authority (made in conjunction with the announced sentence) (RCM 1106(d)(3)(B)), and any addi-
      tional credit awarded by the military judge for illegal pretrial confinement. The SJAR should also con-
      tain the maximum sentence for the guilty specifications/charges and any pretrial agreement. The terms
      of the agreement should include the sentence the convening authority is authorized to approve pursu-
      ant to the agreement.
      9.13.5. The SJAR should address any previously approved request from the accused for deferral of
      confinement, forfeitures of pay, and/or reduction in grade, and any previously approved or pending
      request from the accused or the accused's dependents for a waiver of mandatory forfeitures under Arti-
      cle 58b, UCMJ. Approved deferrals and waivers must be documented in the convening authority's
      action and the convening authority must act upon pending requests.
         9.13.5.1. If a convening authority previously disapproved a request for deferral or waiver prior to
         initial action on the sentence, comment in the SJAR on that request and what action may still be
         appropriate. For example, a convening authority may disapprove a deferral or waiver request
         based upon matters adverse to the accused from outside the record, knowledge of which the
         accused is not chargeable. If the convening authority also considers such matters when taking
         action on the sentence, the accused is entitled to notice and an opportunity to rebut. See RCM
         1107(b)(3)(B)(iii). Notice may be satisfied through the SJAR.

9.14. Preparing and Signing the SJAR. The SJAR must clearly indicate that the recommendation is
from the SJA. An assistant performing the duties of the SJA may sign as "Acting SJA." An assistant SJA
may prepare the recommendation, but the SJA (or if unavailable, the “Acting SJA”) must review the ROT
and sign the SJAR. No person who participated in the court-martial as a member, a military judge, a trial
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                      145


counsel, a defense counsel or investigating officer may draft or sign the SJAR or addendum or otherwise
act as the SJA or legal advisor to any reviewing or convening authority in that case. See RCM 1106(b).
   9.14.1. If the convening authority does not have an SJA (or “Acting SJA”) or the person serving in
   that capacity is disqualified under RCM 1106(b) or otherwise, then the convening authority must
   request the assignment of another SJA to prepare the SJAR or forward the record to any GCMCA as
   provided in RCM 1107(a). See RCM 1106(c)(1).
       9.14.1.1. If all judge advocates on the SPCMCA’s staff are disqualified from preparing and sign-
       ing the SJAR, forward the record to the GCMCA's SJA. That officer may prepare and sign the
       SJAR or designate another SJA (or “Acting SJA”) in the GCMCA’s command to prepare and sign
       the SJAR.
       9.14.1.2. If all judge advocates on the GCMCA’s staff are disqualified from preparing and signing
       the SJAR, forward the record to the MAJCOM’s SJA. That officer may prepare and sign the SJAR
       or designate another SJA (or “Acting SJA”) in the MAJCOM to prepare and sign the SJAR. If all
       the SJAs (or “Acting SJAs”) in the MAJCOM are disqualified from preparing and signing the
       SJAR, the MAJCOM SJA requests AFLOA/JAJM’s assistance in designating an SJA to prepare
       and sign the SJAR.
   9.14.2. If the original SJA did not sign the SJAR, the SJA signing the SJAR must include an explana-
   tion in the allied papers of the ROT. An explanation is not required if it is clear from the ROT (e.g.,
   forwarding memorandum, transfer memorandum) why the original SJA did not sign the SJAR.

9.15. Service of SJAR on Defense. Ensure copies of the SJAR, including its attachments, are served on
the accused's counsel and, unless impracticable, on the accused. Obtain receipts for service of the SJAR
from both and include in the ROT. If service on the accused is impracticable or if the accused so requests
on the record at the court-martial or in writing, forward the accused’s copy to the accused’s defense coun-
sel and attach a statement to the ROT explaining why the accused was not served. See RCM 1106(f)(1).

9.16. Defense Counsel Response to SJAR. The accused's counsel may submit objections or rebuttal to
any matter in the SJAR and may comment on any other matter. Defense counsel must submit comments
within 10 days of service of the ROT on the accused (under RCM 1104(b)) or receipt of the SJAR, which-
ever is later, unless the period is extended. See RCM 1106(f)(4) and (5).

9.17. Addendum to the SJAR. When the SJA receives matters submitted by an accused or defense
counsel under RCM 1105 or 1106(f)(4) after service of the SJAR on defense, the SJA must prepare an
addendum to the SJAR for the convening authority. The SJA must address whether corrective action is
required when an allegation of error is raised in matters submitted under RCM 1105. The response may
consist of a statement of agreement or disagreement with the matter raised by the accused or counsel.
RCM 1106(d)(4). The SJA may address other matters raised by defense submissions in the addendum.
Figure 9.6. is a sample addendum to the SJAR when defense matters are submitted. If matters are not sub-
mitted, the SJA should still prepare an addendum to the SJAR. See paragraph 9.17.3.
   9.17.1. The Addendum to the SJAR must:
       9.17.1.1. List each defense submission as a separate attachment to the addendum;
       9.17.1.2. Advise the convening authority that he or she must consider all written matters submit-
       ted by the defense. RCM 1107(b)(3)(A)(iii); and,
146                                                          AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


         9.17.1.3. Advise the convening authority that he or she may consider other matters prior to taking
         action, such as the ROT, personnel records of the accused, and such other matters as the convening
         authority deems appropriate. However, if the convening authority considers matters adverse to the
         accused from outside the record, with knowledge of which the accused is not chargeable, the
         accused must be notified and given an opportunity to rebut. See RCM 1107(b)(3)(B).
      9.17.2. New Matters in Addendum. New matters include all references to issues that are not
      included in the ROT and are not served on defense counsel and the accused with the SJAR. New mat-
      ters ordinarily do not include the SJA's discussion of the correctness of the defense counsel's com-
      ments on the recommendation. If the addendum includes new matters serve the accused and defense
      counsel with the addendum containing the new matter. They are allowed 10 days from service to sub-
      mit comments. RCM 1106(f)(7).
         9.17.2.1. When an addendum containing new matters is served upon the accused and defense
         counsel for comment, a second or additional addendum must be prepared to address defense com-
         ments or the absence of such comments. The second or additional addendum must list any addi-
         tional defense submissions as an attachment, must re-advise the convening authority to comply
         with paragraphs 9.17.1.2. and 9.17.1.3., and may address any matters raised in additional defense
         submissions. If any addendum contains new matters, comply with paragraph 9.17.2.
      9.17.3. If the SJA does not receive matters from the accused or defense counsel per RCM 1105 after
      service of the SJAR on defense per RCM 1106, the SJA must still prepare an addendum to the SJAR
      for the convening authority. In this case, the matters addressed in paragraphs 9.17.1.1. and 9.17.1.2.
      are not required, nor would paragraph 9.17.2. apply unless new matters are addressed in the Adden-
      dum to the SJAR. Figure 9.7. is a sample addendum to the SJAR when defense matters are not sub-
      mitted.

9.18. Staff Summary Sheets. Avoid use of a staff summary sheet (SSS) in conjunction with the SJAR,
addendum to the SJAR, and action memorandum. If a SSS or other document is used to forward the
record (e.g., SJAR, action memorandum, RCM 1105 or RCM 1106 matters from the defense, Addendum
to the SJAR, ROT) to the convening authority for action, it must be included with the ROT. The contents
of any SSS should not ordinarily include any information not previously addressed in the SJAR or adden-
dum to the SJAR. Such information in the SSS may constitute new matter. Any document that the SJA
uses to supplement the post-trial recommendation must be served on the defense counsel when it contains
new matter. United States v. Thompson, 43 M.J. 703 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 1995). If the SSS adds new mat-
ter not otherwise addressed in the SJAR or addendum to the SJAR, it must be served on the accused and
defense counsel for comment. United States v. Leslie, 16 M.J. 714 (A.F.C.M.R. 1983).

Section 9F—Initial Action by the Convening Authority (RCM 1107).

9.19. When Initial Action May Be Taken. The convening authority may not take initial action until the
time period for the accused to submit matters for consideration under RCM 1105(c) has expired or the
accused has waived the right to submit such matters under RCM 1105(d).
      9.19.1. Action While RILO is Pending. The convening authority must not, under any circum-
      stances, take action under RCM 1107 on any officer case in which an accused's resignation for the
      good of the service (RILO) is pending final SECAF decision (see paragraph 8.17.2.).
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                         147


   9.19.2. Acquittals. There is no convening authority action for an acquittal of all charges and specifi-
   cations. A promulgating order is required. See paragraph 10.8.1.1.

9.20. Convening Authority Discretion. The convening authority is not required to take any action on
the findings, to review the case for legal errors, or to review the case for factual sufficiency. Action taken
on the findings and sentence is a matter of command prerogative and within the sole discretion of the con-
vening authority.
   9.20.1. Convening authorities should consider an accused's service in an area of combat operations in
   determining what punishment, if any, to approve. Where the sentence of an accused with an outstand-
   ing record in an area of combat operations extends to a punitive discharge, convening authorities
   should consider suspending or remitting the discharge, provided that return to duty is in the best inter-
   ests of the Air Force.
   9.20.2. Convening authorities may not substitute an administrative discharge for an adjudged puni-
   tive discharge. However, in cases involving relatively minor offenses, an accused with an outstanding
   combat record, or other exceptional circumstances, and where restoration to duty is inappropriate,
   convening and reviewing authorities may consider recommending to SECAF, administrative, rather
   than punitive, separation under Article 74(b), UCMJ. Contact AFLOA/JAJR, 112 Luke Avenue,
   Room 343, Bolling AFB, DC 20032-8000, for assistance and coordination on such recommendations.

9.21. Disqualification of Convening Authority. A convening authority may not conduct the post-trial
review of a case if the attendant facts and circumstances would lead a reasonable person to impute to him/
her a personal interest in the outcome of the case or a personal bias towards the accused. United States v.
Gudmundson, 57 M.J. 493 (2002); United States v. Voorhees, 50 M.J. 494 (1999); United States v. Cross-
ley, 10 M.J. 376 (C.M.A. 1981); United States v. Gordon, 1 C.M.A. 255, 2 C.M.R. 161 (C.M.A. 1952).
   9.21.1. If the SPCMCA is unable to take action in a case, forward the case to the GCMCA through
   the GCMCA’s SJA. If the GCMCA is unable to take action, the MAJCOM commander designates a
   convening authority to do so.
   9.21.2. The ROT allied papers must include a memorandum by the SJA (of the convening authority
   taking action) explaining why a different convening authority took action on the case. The memoran-
   dum is not required if it is clear from the ROT (e.g., forwarding memorandum, transfer memorandum)
   why a different convening authority took action on the case.
   9.21.3. Transfer of responsibility for recommendation and action does not transfer authority to order
   or rescind deferments of sentence under Article 57a. That authority remains with the convening
   authority granting the deferment or, if the accused is no longer under that command, then with the
   GCMCA for the command to which the accused is currently assigned.

9.22. Format for Initial Actions. Prepare convening authority's initial action in accordance with RCM
1107(f) and the guidance in the MCM, Appendix 16. Samples of a convening authority's initial action are
at Figure 9.8.
   9.22.1. Findings. Findings are addressed in the action only when any findings of guilty are disap-
   proved, in whole or part. See sample formats in MCM, Appendix 16.
   9.22.2. Deferred Forfeitures and Reduction in Grade and Waiver of Automatic Forfeitures.
   See Section 9G for guidance, and Figure 9.8. and Figure 9.9. for sample formats for initial actions.

9.23. Additional Considerations When Preparing Initial Actions.
      9.23.1. Limitation on Forfeitures. If no confinement is adjudged and a forfeiture exceeding
      two-thirds pay per month is adjudged, reduce the approved forfeiture to not more than two-thirds pay
      per month to run for a specified period of time or up until the punitive discharge is executed. Where
      an accused sentenced to an adjudged period of confinement and a forfeiture exceeding two-thirds pay
      per month has served the adjudged period of confinement prior to the convening authority’s action,
      reduce the approved forfeiture to not more than total forfeitures for the period the accused was in con-
      finement and not more than two-thirds pay per month thereafter, to run either for a specified period of
      time or up until execution of an adjudged punitive discharge. See RCM 1107(d)(2), Discussion;
      United States v. Craze, 56 M.J. 777 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2002); United States v. York, 53 M.J. 553
      (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2000); and United States v. Warner, 25 M.J. 64 (C.M.A. 1987).
      9.23.2. Duration of Forfeitures. When total forfeitures are approved, the duration of forfeitures is
      not specified. An enlisted member, sentenced to a punitive discharge, confinement and total forfei-
      tures, restored to duty after release from confinement is entitled to pay and allowances from the date
      the member is restored to duty, and the forfeitures become inoperative thereafter. DoD 7000.14-R,
      Department of Defense Financial Management Regulations, Vol. 7A, para. 480804.
      9.23.3. Application of Article 58a, UCMJ. The provisions of Article 58a do not apply to the Air
      Force. All reductions in grade will be based upon adjudged and approved sentences.
      9.23.4. Suspension of Sentences and Proceedings to Vacate a Suspended Sentence. R C M 11 0 8
      and RCM 1109. In a case where the convening authority suspends all or part of the execution of a sen-
      tence, include a copy of the suspension terms and the member's receipt in each copy of the ROT with
      the suspension action. If a suspended sentence is later vacated, document the vacation hearing on a
      DD Form 455, Report of Proceedings to Vacate Suspension of a General Court-Martial Sentence or of
      a Special Court-Martial Sentence Including a Bad-Conduct Discharge Under Article 72, UCMJ, and
      R.C.M. 1109. If the member waives the vacation hearing, the DD Form 455 is not required. Send the
      completed DD Form 455 or the member's waiver to AFLOA/JAJM for review and filing with the orig-
      inal ROT. Distribute court-martial orders announcing the vacation of a suspended sentence as required
      in Chapter 10. Use special orders to announce SCM sentence vacations.

Section 9G—Articles 57(a) and 58b, UCMJ.

9.24. Distinctions between Articles 57(a) and 58b, UCMJ. Articles 57(a) and 58b are separate and dis-
tinct statutory provisions. They serve different purposes.
      9.24.1. Article 57(a) mandates the effective date of any forfeiture of pay and allowances or reduction
      in grade that is included in the sentence of a court-martial. It provides that adjudged forfeitures and an
      adjudged reduction in grade will take effect upon the convening authority’s action or 14 days after the
      sentence is adjudged, whichever occurs first. There is no additional requirement under Article 57(a)
      for the sentence to include confinement or a punitive discharge. Therefore, adjudged forfeitures and
      reductions, unless deferred, should take effect on the date provided for in Article 57(a) even if there is
      no confinement or punitive discharge in the case.
      9.24.2. Article 58b requires forfeiture of pay (and allowances in general courts-martial) due a mem-
      ber during qualified periods of confinement or parole. The mandatory forfeitures (also known as
      required or automatic forfeitures) under this provision only take effect if three conditions exist:
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                     149


       9.24.2.1. The adjudged sentence includes confinement for more than six months or death, or con-
       finement for any period and a dishonorable discharge, bad conduct discharge, or dismissal;
       9.24.2.2. The accused is in confinement or on parole; and
       9.24.2.3. The accused is otherwise entitled to pay and allowances that are subject to mandatory
       forfeitures.
   9.24.3. As with adjudged forfeitures, mandatory forfeitures take effect the date of action or 14 days
   after the sentence is adjudged, whichever is sooner. The amount of pay and allowances forfeited in a
   general court-martial is all pay and allowances otherwise due the accused. The amount of pay for-
   feited in a special court-martial is two-thirds of pay otherwise due the accused. Allowances otherwise
   due are not subject to mandatory forfeitures in special courts-martial.

9.25. Deferral and Waiver Provisions under Articles 57(a) and 58b: Articles 57(a) and 58b contain
provisions that enable a convening authority to permit payments to the accused and/or the accused’s
dependents that would otherwise have been forfeited.
   9.25.1. Article 57(a)(2) permits the convening authority to defer either adjudged forfeitures or an
   adjudged reduction in grade, or both, from taking effect until action. The accused must submit a writ-
   ten request to have adjudged and, if applicable, mandatory forfeitures deferred. The accused’s pay will
   not stop if the convening authority approves a deferment of both adjudged and mandatory forfeitures,
   or approves a deferment of only adjudged forfeitures when there are no mandatory forfeitures. The
   convening authority may rescind a deferment at any time. Deferred forfeitures are paid to the accused.
   9.25.2. Mandatory forfeitures can only be waived in cases where an accused has dependents. Waived
   forfeitures must be paid to the dependents. See paragraph 9.27. for dependency determinations.
   9.25.3. Mandatory forfeitures can only be waived by the convening authority for a period not exceed-
   ing six months, or the period of confinement if less than six months.
   9.25.4. Waived forfeitures cannot be applied beyond the member's expiration of term of service
   (ETS) because the pay entitlement ceases at that point.
   9.25.5. The accused does not have to apply for a waiver of mandatory forfeitures. The convening
   authority may waive mandatory forfeitures on his or her initiative.
   9.25.6. The convening authority can waive mandatory forfeitures either before taking action or when
   taking action on the case. The waiver can be retroactive, designated to begin on a date 14 days after
   the sentence is adjudged.
   9.25.7. The convening authority must defer, suspend, mitigate or disapprove all or part of adjudged
   total forfeitures in order to waive any amount of mandatory forfeitures. Mandatory forfeitures can be
   waived for the benefit of the accused’s dependents only to the extent adjudged forfeitures are not in
   effect. See United States v. Emminizer, 56 M.J. 441 (2002).
   9.25.8. A convening authority can defer mandatory forfeitures (and any adjudged forfeitures) until
   action and then waive mandatory forfeitures for a period not to exceed six months. A combination of
   deferral and waiver can maximize the pay and allowances going to the accused and his or her family.

9.26. Mechanics of Deferring and Waiving Forfeitures: Figure 9.1. explains the relationship between
adjudged and mandatory forfeitures from the date sentence is adjudged until the end of the forfeiture
period. Figure 9.1. provides examples of the interplay between adjudged and mandatory forfeitures. To
assist in drafting the convening authority’s action on the sentence, see Figure 9.8. and Figure 9.9.

                                part.

NOTES:
  1. Mandatory forfeitures (MF) only apply when the three conditions listed in paragraph 9.24.2. exist.
      2. If the accused applies for deferment, the convening authority (CA) may defer all or a portion of
         the AF and/or MF 14 days after the date on which the sentence was adjudged until the convening
         authority takes action. The accused should specify whether the deferment requested is for AF, MF,
         or both (a request for deferment of forfeitures in general is considered a request for both). If a
         deferment is approved, the accused will be paid a sum equal to the pay and allowances to which
         he or she is entitled, minus any amounts forfeited (AF and/or MF not deferred). The CA may
         rescind a deferment (AF and/or MF) at any time.
      3. The CA may waive available MF with or without a request from the accused. The CA may waive
         MF to the extent that the accused is entitled to pay and allowances (see Note 1 above).
      4. MF may be waived until the earlier of: 1) a period not to exceed six months; 2) the accused’s
         release from confinement; or 3) the last day the accused is otherwise entitled to pay and allow-
         ances (see Note 1 above).
      5. At action, the CA may waive all or portion of the available MF (if previously waived, waiver is
         memorialized in the action) for the benefit of the accused’s dependents. The CA may disapprove,
         commute or suspend all or a portion of the AF to increase the amount of MF available for the CA
         to waive. The CA may retroactively waive MF, starting 14 days after the date on which the sen-
         tence was adjudged.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                      151


  9.26.1. Accused’s Deferral Request. If an accused requests a deferral of a reduction in grade and/or
  a forfeiture of pay (and allowances) until action is taken, the convening authority may approve the
  request, in full or in part, or may disapprove the request.
     9.26.1.1. The accused’s deferral request should specify whether a request for deferred forfeitures
     is for adjudged forfeitures, mandatory forfeitures, or both. If it is unclear, the convening authority
     may treat it as a request for deferral of both.
     9.26.1.2. The convening authority’s action on the request should be reflected in a signed and
     dated document.
     9.26.1.3. The terms of approved deferrals must also be reported in a 14-day priority message in
     accordance with Figure 9.10. and must be reported in the action the convening authority ulti-
     mately takes on the case.
     9.26.1.4. A deferral of forfeitures may be for adjudged forfeitures, mandatory forfeitures, or both,
     and for all pay and allowances to which the accused is entitled or a lesser sum.
  9.26.2. Waiver of Mandatory Forfeitures. In cases where mandatory forfeitures are waived,
  whether prior to or as party of the action, the approved waiver should express the amount approved in
  dollar amounts per month. The exception to this is when the waiver is for total pay and allowances in
  a general court-martial or two-thirds pay in a special court-martial.
     9.26.2.1. Approved requests must identify the dependents that will receive the waived forfeitures.
     If payments are made to an ex-spouse or other person on behalf of minor dependents, confirmation
     that the designated payee is the appointed guardian or custodian of a minor dependent is required.
     9.26.2.2. If mandatory forfeitures are waived before action, the convening authority should
     reflect approval in a signed and dated document. Such a waiver of mandatory forfeitures should
     also be reported in the 14-day priority message and in the convening authority’s action on the case.
     9.26.2.3. Contact the local accounting and finance office to determine the accused’s entitlements
     and the actual amount of pay and allowances the accused and/or the accused’s dependents may be
     entitled to receive. A number of factors can impact these entitlements:
         9.26.2.3.1. BAS. In most cases, the accused will lose BAS upon entering confinement. There-
         fore, the convening authority cannot give the accused’s family any portion of the accused’s
         BAS.
         9.26.2.3.2. TAXES. Federal and state taxes will be withheld from any payments of deferred
         or waived forfeitures. Therefore, if the convening authority wants the accused’s family to
         receive a certain amount of money, the amount of taxes should be factored into the calculation.
         9.26.2.3.3. GRADE REDUCTION. A reduction in grade may significantly lower the
         amount of the accused’s pay that is eligible for waiver. Therefore, if the convening authority
         wants the accused’s family to receive a certain amount of money, the effect of a reduction in
         grade should be taken into consideration.
         9.26.2.3.4. SPOUSE on ACTIVE DUTY. A spouse who is also an active duty military
         member can receive only waived forfeiture of pay, not pay and allowances.
         9.26.2.3.5. ETS. There are no forfeitures to waive on any date after the accused’s ETS. Any
         pretrial agreement to approve a waiver of any amount of forfeitures when the accused is near
152                                                          AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


             or beyond his or her ETS may render pleas improvident because the accused may not receive
             the benefit of his bargain. Pretrial agreements containing a waiver provision must clearly state
             that any waiver is only applicable to pay and/or allowances that the accused is otherwise enti-
             tled to receive. See United States v. Perron, 58 M.J. 78 (2003) and paragraph 8.5.2.1.

9.27. Dependency Determinations under Article 58b: When addressing waivers of mandatory forfei-
tures under Article 58b, UCMJ, an issue may arise as to whether a person qualifies as a dependent.
      9.27.1. Dependent Categories. RCM 1101(d)(3) provides that, for the purpose of waiving forfei-
      tures, a “dependent” means any person qualifying as a dependent according to 37 U.S.C. § 401. This
      statute identifies four categories of dependents:
         9.27.1.1. Spouse of the accused, regardless of military status.
         9.27.1.2. Unmarried child of the accused under 21 years of age, including an adopted child or
         stepchild. In addition, special rules permit a child as old as 23 years of age to be a dependent if
         enrolled as a full-time student and a child older than 21 years of age to be a dependent if incapable
         of self-support due to mental or physical incapacity. However, in these two cases the accused must
         provide more than one-half of the child’s support.
         9.27.1.3. Parent of the accused. Additional dependency requirements are required, including the
         accused providing over one-half of the parent’s support. Parents includes natural parents, steppar-
         ents, and adoptive parents of the accused or the accused’s spouse; and any other person who stood
         in loco parentis to the accused for a continuous 5 year period before the member became 21 years
         of age.
         9.27.1.4. Unmarried persons placed in legal custody of the member as a result of a court order for
         a period of at least 12 months. This category of persons, known as wards, must depend upon the
         accused for over one-half of their support and must meet numerous other criteria set forth in the
         statute (37 U.S.C. § 401).
      9.27.2. Evidence of Dependency. Sufficient evidence of dependency is required to support an Arti-
      cle 58b waiver. The nature of this evidence will depend on the status of the dependent.
         9.27.2.1. Dependency status for a spouse and/or child may be established by their enrollment in
         DEERS or by other competent evidence, such as a marriage certificate for a spouse or a birth cer-
         tificate or court order establishing paternity and/or child support obligations for a child.
         9.27.2.2. Dependency determinations for a child over 21 years of age, parents, or a ward are more
         complex because they only qualify as a dependent if the military sponsor provides more than
         one-half of their support. A thorough determination by DFAS is necessary. A precondition for
         waiving forfeitures for the benefit of one of these dependents should be an “approval letter” of
         dependency from DFAS. The accused, or other party requesting the waiver, should provide a copy
         of the DFAS “approval letter” with any request to waive mandatory forfeitures.
         9.27.2.3. If an accused has failed to qualify or was unable to qualify the person(s) as dependent(s)
         with DFAS, there will normally be insufficient evidence of dependency to support an Article 58b
         waiver of mandatory forfeitures.

9.28. Service of Legal Reviews on the Accused : The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals has
addressed whether an SJA’s legal advice to a convening authority regarding requests for deferral or waiver
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                        153


of forfeitures must be served upon the accused with an opportunity to respond. Deferrals need not be
served, see 9.28.1. Waivers must be served, see 9.28.2. In either case, legal offices should process requests
promptly.
   9.28.1. Article 57(a) Deferral of Forfeiture Requests. In United States v. Key, 55 M.J. 537 (A.F. Ct.
   Crim. App. 2001), the Court held that an SJA review of a request for deferral of forfeitures does not
   need to be served on the defense for comment prior to submission to the convening authority. The
   Court compared such a request to a request for deferral of a sentence to confinement, for which no
   SJA recommendation is required and, historically, the SJA’s legal analysis of the request is not served
   on the accused. Any SJA review and action by the convening authority on the request must become a
   part of the completed ROT.
   9.28.2. Article 58b Waiver of Forfeiture Requests. In United States v. Spears, 48 M.J. 768 (A.F.
   Ct. Crim. App. 1998), the Court considered whether a legal review of a request for a waiver of forfei-
   tures must be served on the defense prior to submission to the convening authority. The Court noted
   that SJAs are not required to prepare legal reviews of requests for waiver of automatic forfeitures. The
   Court treated the request for waiver of forfeitures as a clemency request and declared that practitioners
   must exercise care when addressing the request for waiver of forfeitures before the record is com-
   pleted. Spears set this basic approach: any legal review prepared by the SJA for the convening author-
   ity prior to completion of the SJAR should be attached to the SJAR and become part of the completed
   ROT. Any legal review that may be prepared after the SJAR should be treated as an addendum to the
   SJAR and served on the accused for comment when it contains matter outside the record. Serve it on
   the accused before submission to the convening authority and include it in the completed ROT.

9.29. Application of Article 57(a) and 58b to cases with offenses committed prior to 1 April 1996.
For cases in which all of the charged offenses occurred before 1 April 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Armed Forces, in United States v. Gorski, 47 M.J. 370 (1997), held these provisions operate in viola-
tion of the ex post facto clause of the Constitution.
   9.29.1. For cases affected by the Gorski decision, any forfeitures collected pursuant to Article 58b
   (mandatory forfeitures); Article 57(a)(1)(A) (adjudged forfeitures taken prior to convening authority
   action); and/or any pay and allowances withheld due to a reduction in grade pursuant to Article
   57(a)(1)(A) (reduction in grade prior to convening authority action), are without legal effect and will
   be restored.
   9.29.2. For cases involving offense(s) committed both before and after 1 April 1996, the Court, in
   United States v. Carter, 49 M.J. 392 (1998), applied unitary sentencing principles and limited the Gor-
   ski holding to those cases where the maximum sentence for any or all offenses committed on or after
   1 April 1996 would induce mandatory forfeitures under Article 58b.

Section 9H—Contingent Confinement

9.30. Contingent Confinement. Contingent confinement is confinement authorized by a court-martial
in the form of a fine-enforcement provision. See RCM 1003(b)(3) and RCM 1113(d)(3). A fine enforce-
ment provision may be ordered executed in accordance with the procedures below.
   9.30.1. Authority to Execute Contingent Confinement. A fine does not become effective until
   ordered executed (Article 57(c), UCMJ). Fines may be ordered executed in the convening authority's
   initial action (Article 71(c)(2), UCMJ). The accused is not required to pay a fine until the fine is
154                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


      ordered executed. Moreover, an accused may not be ordered to serve contingent confinement until the
      fine is ordered executed and the requirements of paragraph 9.31. are met. If the accused fails to dem-
      onstrate that he or she has made good faith efforts to pay the fine but cannot because of indigency, the
      convening authority may order the sentence of confinement executed by following the procedures
      outlined in paragraph 9.31.
      9.30.2. Enforcement. Once court-martial jurisdiction attaches, an accused remains subject to the
      UCMJ through the execution and enforcement of a sentence. Article 2(a)(1), UCMJ, confers jurisdic-
      tion over members of a regular component of the armed forces, including those awaiting discharge
      after the expiration of terms of enlistment. Jurisdiction continues for the purpose of enforcing an
      adjudged sentence for individuals discharged as the result of a court-martial conviction. Carter v.
      McClaughry, 183 U.S. 365 (1902); Peebles v. Froehlke, 46 C.M.R. 266 (1973).

9.31. Procedures for Executing Contingent Confinement. Contingent confinement may be executed
in accordance with the following procedures:
      9.31.1. When the fine is ordered executed, the accused must be notified in writing the fine is due and
      payable. A specific due date should be included in the notification. If the accused is in confinement,
      the due date should normally be a reasonable period before the accused is scheduled for release from
      confinement to allow adequate time for a contingent confinement hearing and convening authority
      action.
      9.31.2. After the fine is considered due, the SJA for the base where the accused was tried ascertains
      whether the accused has met his or her obligations concerning the fine. If it appears the fine has not
      been paid, notify the convening authority. If the convening authority finds probable cause to believe a
      fine is unpaid, the convening authority may order a contingent confinement hearing. The convening
      authority for this hearing is the officer exercising GCMCA over the command to which the accused is
      assigned. If the accused is no longer a member of the Air Force, the Air Force District of Washington
      (AFDW) Commander (GCMCA over the Air Force Corrections System) is the convening authority.
      The purpose of the hearing is to determine whether the fine is delinquent, whether the delinquency, if
      any, resulted from the accused's indigence and whether the contingent confinement should be exe-
      cuted.
      9.31.3. A military judge is detailed as hearing officer to conduct the contingent confinement hearing
      in the same manner as detailed to a court-martial.
      9.31.4. The accused is provided written notice of the time and place of the hearing. The convening
      authority provides the accused with temporary duty orders or invitational travel orders if the accused
      is not in confinement and the hearing is beyond reasonable commuting distance from the accused's
      residence. See Figure 6.9. for appropriate funding authority. The notice informs the accused of the
      following:
         9.31.4.1. The accused's alleged failure to pay the fine;
         9.31.4.2. The purpose of the hearing to determine whether the fine is delinquent and whether the
         delinquency, if any, is the result of the accused's indigence;
         9.31.4.3. The accused’s right to present witnesses and documentary evidence;
         9.31.4.4. The accused’s right to representation by military defense counsel; and
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                          155


      9.31.4.5. The evidence which was relied upon in issuing the notice of hearing and the options
      available to the convening authority.
  9.31.5. Unless the hearing is otherwise waived, the hearing officer makes findings on whether pay-
  ment of a fine is delinquent and whether any delinquency resulted from the accused's indigence. Pay-
  ment of a fine is delinquent if not made within the period specified in the approved sentence or, if no
  period is specified, within a reasonable time. An accused's failure to pay a fine is not due to indigence
  if the failure to pay the fine resulted from a willful refusal to pay the fine or a failure to make sufficient
  good faith efforts to pay it. The Government bears the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evi-
  dence, of showing that payment of the fine is delinquent. The accused bears the burden of proof, by a
  preponderance of the evidence, of showing that any delinquency resulted from indigence. See 18
  U.S.C. § 3572(a) for criteria to consider in making these determinations.
  9.31.6. Hearing Procedures.
      9.31.6.1. The hearing officer determines the facts from the best evidence available. Rulings on
      evidentiary and procedural matters are final. Strict evidentiary rules do not apply and hearsay
      statements are admissible.
      9.31.6.2. The accused may testify and present witnesses and documentary evidence. Witness tes-
      timony may be presented through sworn or unsworn statements, affidavits, depositions, prior tes-
      timony, stipulations of expected testimony, or telephone conference. The accused may not compel
      the production of a witness at Government expense unless the request is made to the hearing
      officer, in writing, before the hearing and the hearing officer determines:
          9.31.6.2.1. The physical presence of the witness is critical to a fair determination of a material
          issue in dispute;
          9.31.6.2.2. The witness is available to testify; and
          9.31.6.2.3. There is no substitute for the live testimony of the prospective witness (e.g. written
          statements, affidavits, stipulations, or telephone conference).
      9.31.6.3. The accused has a right to confront and cross-examine those witnesses testifying at the
      hearing.
      9.31.6.4. The accused may be represented at the hearing by a civilian attorney or civilian repre-
      sentative of the accused's choice at no cost to the Government. The accused is also entitled to rep-
      resentation by either an ADC or military counsel of the accused's selection, if reasonably available
      (see paragraph 5.4.). The accused is not entitled to representation by more than one military coun-
      sel.
      9.31.6.5. A court reporter reports the hearing and prepares a summarized record of the proceed-
      ing. The record includes a summary of the evidence presented and any objections or requests con-
      sidered by the hearing officer.
      9.31.6.6. The hearing officer submits a written report to the convening authority through the SJA,
      including a statement of the evidence relied upon to support the findings. If the hearing officer
      chooses to make the findings and statement of evidence on the record, transcribe them verbatim.
      The hearing officer forwards the report and/or record to the convening authority.
      9.31.6.7. The convening authority takes final action on the hearing officer's findings and determi-
      nations. The convening authority may adopt, modify or reject the hearing officer's findings and
156                                                         AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


         determinations. If the hearing officer's findings and determinations are not adopted, the convening
         authority must specify the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the decision.
         9.31.6.8. If the convening authority determines payment of the fine is delinquent and the failure
         to pay is not due to indigence, the convening authority may order the sentence of confinement exe-
         cuted. See Figure 9.11. for a sample order executing contingent confinement. If the convening
         authority determines the accused has made good efforts to pay the fine, but cannot because of indi-
         gency, the convening authority may not order the sentence of confinement executed unless he or
         she determines that there is no other punishment adequate to meet the Government’s interest in
         appropriate punishment. See RCM 1113(d)(3).
         9.31.6.9. Forward a copy of the summarized record of the contingent confinement hearing for
         each copy of the ROT required by AFMAN 51-203, chapters 3 and 13 to AFLOA/JAJM.

Section 9I—Notifications of Adjudged Sentence, Action of the Convening Authority, and Deferment
or Waiver

9.32. Reporting by Base Level SJA. In all courts-martial with mandatory forfeitures under Article 58b,
UCMJ, adjudged forfeitures, or reduction in grade, the SJA of the office that prosecuted the case must
send a message by the most expeditious means available to HQ AFPC/DPPPWM and the member's
finance office, with informational copies to HQ AFSFC/SFC and DFAS-DE/FJPC in the format set out in
Figure 9.10. The referenced message must be sent within 24 hours of the date the convening authority
takes action under RCM 1107 or 14 days after the sentence is adjudged, whichever is earlier. If any por-
tion of the punishment or mandatory forfeitures is deferred or if the convening authority waives any por-
tion of the mandatory forfeitures prior to the date of the message, the message must include the terms of
such deferment or waiver.

9.33. Reporting by Convening Authority's SJA. If action is taken more than 14 days after the sentence
is adjudged, in any case where the approved sentence includes a reduction in grade or forfeitures (manda-
tory or adjudged), the SJA of the convening authority must send a second priority message within 24
hours after the convening authority’s RCM 1107 action. If any portion of the punishment or mandatory
forfeiture is deferred or if the convening authority waives any portion of the mandatory forfeiture, the sec-
ond message must include the terms of such deferment or waiver. Send the message to the same address-
ees listed in paragraph 9.33. and, if the accused is confined, to the confinement facility, using the format
in Figure 9.10. For members who enter a prisoner status requiring a permanent change of station, also
send the message to the gaining AFO.

9.34. Notification and Distribution of Documents to Confinement Facilities.
      9.34.1. After action by the original convening authority, the AFDW Commander exercises GCMCA
      over inmates transferred to Level II Regional Corrections Facilities (RCFs) and long-term corrections
      facilities as defined in AFI 31-205, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and over those Air Force members
      and former members paroled or placed on excess leave from such facilities.
      9.34.2. When an inmate (with or without a punitive separation) is transferred into the Air Force Cor-
      rections System, the servicing SJA sends:
         9.34.2.1. Four copies of the court-martial order to HQ AFSFC/SFC and two copies of the
         court-martial order to the corrections officer of the facility housing the offender;
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                         157


      9.34.2.2. Two copies of any victim request to be notified of changes in the inmate's status and of
      clemency hearings to both HQ AFSFC/SFC and the corrections officer;
      9.34.2.3. One copy of the SJAR to both HQ AFSFC/SFC and the corrections officer;
      9.34.2.4. One copy of the ROT to the corrections officer, if the approved confinement is one year
      or more.
   9.34.3. If at the time the inmate is transferred to a corrections facility, the court-martial order has not
   been published, send one copy of the AF Form 1359 and the convening authority's action to HQ
   AFSFC/SFC (facsimile transmission in lieu of mailing is permissible, DSN 473-0788) and two copies
   of each to the corrections officer.

Section 9J—Involuntary (Required) and Voluntary Excess Leave

9.35. Excess Leave.
   9.35.1. The convening authority may place an accused that had either no confinement adjudged or
   already completed the period of confinement on involuntary excess leave while awaiting appellate
   review of an unsuspended punitive separation (See Article 76a, UCMJ). Members of the Air Reserve
   Components may be removed from active duty status rather than being placed in excess leave and
   recalled as necessary to complete appellate review.
   9.35.2. Members with an adjudged sentence that includes a punitive discharge may volunteer to be
   placed on excess leave pending the convening authority's action. If the convening authority approves
   the punitive separation, terminate the accused’s voluntary excess leave status. Return the accused to
   duty or place on involuntary excess leave.
   9.35.3. When an approved sentence includes unsuspended confinement, the confinement must be
   served, remitted, or deferred before placing an accused on either voluntary or involuntary excess
   leave.
   9.35.4. An accused with accrued leave when required to take excess leave may elect to either receive
   pay and allowances during the period of accrued leave and then continue on unpaid excess leave or
   receive payment for the accrued leave as of the day excess leave begins, and serve the entire period on
   unpaid excess leave.
   9.35.5. If the accused's sentence to a punitive separation is set aside or disapproved upon appellate
   review, the accused is entitled to pay and allowances for the period of required excess leave, unless a
   rehearing or new trial is ordered and a punitive separation results from the rehearing. The amount of
   pay and allowances is reduced by the amount of income, unemployment compensation, and public
   assistance benefits received by the accused from any government agency during the period of excess
   leave.
   9.35.6. The convening authority may order the accused to begin involuntary excess leave upon com-
   pletion of a sentence to confinement in the RCM 1107 action, upon completion of a sentence to con-
   finement or at any time following approval of a sentence which includes a punitive discharge, subject
   to paragraph 9.35.3. Such involuntary excess leave may continue until the date the discharge is exe-
   cuted, unless terminated at any earlier date.
158                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


      9.35.7. When a convening authority directs excess leave for an accused serving in an overseas area,
      the convening authority directs reassignment to the Mission Support Squadron at the base nearest the
      appellate leave address provided by the accused.
         9.35.7.1. An accused may go directly to his or her leave address without reporting into the gaining
         unit. The accused will determine whether to physically report into the gaining unit before depar-
         ture.
         9.35.7.2. The losing commander, consistent with the accused’s election, will direct the accused to
         travel from the overseas location to either the appellate leave address or the gaining unit as soon as
         possible after completion of out processing. After arrival, the accused will commence taking
         accrued leave, if so elected, and/or required excess leave.
         9.35.7.3. The accused will be considered assigned to the Mission Support Squadron at the gaining
         base on the date the member physically reports to the unit or, in cases where the accused does not
         physically report to the gaining unit, the date determined by the local MPF’s Personnel Reloca-
         tions Element based upon the accused’s departure date and travel time.
         9.35.7.4. Overseas members may provide a leave address in an OCONUS state or territory of the
         United States (e.g., Alaska, Hawaii, Guam) and HQ AFPC may assign the member to the Mission
         Support Squadron nearest such leave address. Overseas airmen in foreign countries must provide
         an appellate leave address in a state or territory of the United States and will be reassigned to a
         Mission Support Squadron at the base nearest the leave address. Overseas members in foreign
         countries will be required to depart the foreign country.
      9.35.8. Procedures for Placing an Accused on Excess Leave. When the convening authority
      orders an accused to take excess leave, the convening authority sends the accused a letter (Figure
      9.12.), through command channels, directing the excess leave and informing the accused of entitle-
      ments, status, and responsibilities while on excess leave. If the convening authority directed the
      excess leave in the action (see Figure 9.8.), the convening authority’s SJA, or Acting SJA, may sign
      and send the letter to the accused. The SJA for the convening authority directing excess leave ensures
      a signed copy of this letter, with the accused's receipt and any subsequent address changes, is sent to
      the servicing MPF. In cases of an accused being reassigned from overseas, send a copy of the letter to
      the SJAs of the SPCMCA and GCMCA of the gaining unit, the gaining excess leave MSS/CC,
      AFLOA/JAJM and AFLOA/JAJA. See Figure 9.12.
         9.35.8.1. Action to place the accused on voluntary or involuntary excess leave must comply with
         JFTR, paragraph U7506, and AFIs 36-3003, Military Leave Program, 36-2110, Assignments,
         36-2102, Base-Level Relocations Procedures and 31-205, The Air Force Corrections System.
      9.35.9. Travel of Personnel Awaiting Completion of Appellate Review (Excess) Leave. A n
      accused involuntarily placed on excess leave while awaiting completion of appellate review of a
      court-martial sentence to a punitive discharge or dismissal from the service may be provided travel or
      transportation in kind, according to the JFTR, Volume I. Ensure a special order is published in "A"
      series if the court-martial convening authority directs involuntary appellate (excess) leave according
      to AFI 36-3003 and this instruction. If the accused's court-martial sentence is disapproved or set aside,
      and the member is restored to duty, the member is authorized travel or transportation in kind, accord-
      ing to the JFTR Volume I. In such cases, publish an "A" Series order.

                                                                                             (Date)


MEMORANDUM FOR (Grade and Name of Accused)


FROM: (JA Office)


SUBJECT: Submission of Matters to the Convening Authority – United States. v. (Grade and Name of
Accused)


1. Since you have been convicted and sentenced by court-martial, you have the right to submit matters for
consideration by the convening authority of your court-martial before the convening authority takes
action on your case. The matters you submit may include any matters that might affect the convening
authority's decision to approve or disapprove any findings of guilt or any part of the sentence in your case.
These matters may include:


       a. Allegations of errors affecting the legality of the findings or sentence in your case.


       b. Portions or summaries of your ROT, or copies of evidence introduced at trial.


       c. Matters in mitigation that were not available for consideration at your trial.


       d. Clemency recommendations by any court member, the military judge, or any other person.


        e. Any other matters you or your counsel believe the convening authority should be aware of
before taking action in your case, whether or not available or introduced into evidence at your trial.


       f. Your desires for entry into the Return to Duty Program. See AFI 31-205.


2. You should consult with your defense counsel to decide whether to submit such matters. The convening
authority will consider all matters you submit before taking action in your case. Failure to submit matters
within the time provided in paragraph 4 constitutes a waiver of your right to do so.
160                                                          AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


3. If you decide not to submit matters for the convening authority's consideration, you may waive, in writ-
ing, the right to submit such matters. Such a waiver may expedite the post-trial processing and review of
your case, if that is what you desire. You should consult your defense counsel before waiving your rights
to submit matters. Once you make such a written waiver, it may not be withdrawn or revoked. You may
indicate any waiver of your rights to submit matters on the indorsement to this letter or by submitting a
separate written waiver.


4. [For a GCM or SPCM, insert:] You have 10 days to submit matters for consideration by the convening
authority from the date you receive a copy of the authenticated ROT or, if applicable, the date both you
and your defense counsel receive a copy of the recommendation of the staff judge advocate, whichever is
later. If you are unable to submit your matters within this period, you may, for good reason, apply to the
convening authority, through the convening authority's staff judge advocate for an extension of the period.


[For a SCM, insert the following as paragraph 4:] You have 7 days from the date your sentence was
announced to submit your matters for the convening authority's consideration. Your matters must be sub-
mitted by (date)(time). If you are unable to submit your matters within this period, you may, for good
cause, apply to the convening authority, through the convening authority's staff judge advocate, for an
extension of the period.


5. In addition to the submissions described above, you may submit an application to the convening author-
ity, through the servicing SJA, to defer any forfeitures of pay or allowances, reduction in grade, or service
of a sentence to confinement. If you have dependents, you may also submit an application to the conven-
ing authority, through the servicing SJA, to waive any mandatory forfeitures of pay and allowances under
Article 58(b), UCMJ, with the amount waived paid to your dependents. Applications for deferral and/or
waiver may be submitted immediately. In order for the convening authority to give such requests proper
consideration, they should normally be submitted no later than the time provided in paragraph 4 above.

I have consulted with my defense counsel concerning my rights to submit matters for the convening
authority’s consideration before the convening authority takes action in my case. After considering the
advice of my defense counsel, I (waive)(do not waive) my right to submit such matters. I (will)(will not)
submit any matters for the convening authority’s consideration.

SUBJECT: Waiver of Right to Submit Clemency Matters – United States v. (Grade and Name of Accused)


1. I have been briefed by my defense counsel, (Name and Grade of Defense Counsel), (Location), con-
cerning my rights to submit matters to the convening authority, detailed in Article 60, UCMJ, (and) Rule
for Court-Martial 1105 (and Article(s) 57a (and 58b), UCMJ), before he/she takes action in my case. After
considering my rights and the advice of my counsel, I hereby elect that I will not submit any matters for
the convening authority’s consideration. This waiver is voluntary and no one has coerced me in any way
or made any promises in regard to my decision.


2. I understand my rights and the time limitations to make submissions to the convening authority. [For a
GCM or SPCM insert:] I understand that I have 10 days from (the later of) my receipt of a copy of the
authenticated record of trial (or receipt of the Staff Judge Advocate’s Recommendation (, or Addendum,
if served upon me)) to submit matters. I understand that I may request an extension of up to 20 additional
days to submit matters and, for good cause, the convening authority or that authority’s staff judge advo-
cate may grant my request. [For a SCM, insert:] I understand that I have 7 days from the date my sentence
was announced to submit matters for the convening authority's consideration. I understand that I may, for
good cause, apply to the convening authority, through the convening authority's staff judge advocate, for
an extension of the period.


3. I understand that the convening authority may, for any reason, disapprove findings of guilt to any
charge and/or specification, but may not change a finding of not guilty to guilty. I also understand that the
convening authority may, for any reason, disapprove a legal sentence, mitigate [lessen] the sentence, or
change a punishment to one of a different [but not more severe] nature. I understand the convening
authority may not increase the severity of the punishment.


4. My counsel has informed me that the convening authority has sole discretion to defer sentences, includ-
ing confinement, reduction in grade and (adjudged and/or mandatory) forfeitures (as well as sole discre-
tion to waive mandatory forfeitures of pay (and allowances)). I hereby voluntarily elect that I will not
submit any requests for a deferment or waiver.

(unsatisfactory), and ( ). [Include any recommendation for clemency by the sentencing authority, made in
conjunction with the announced sentence under RCM 1106(d)(3)(B). Also address any military judge
awarded additional credit for illegal pretrial confinement.]


4. [Note: If the defense raised legal errors in matters submitted under RCM 1105, address them pursuant
to RCM 1106(d)(4). Also, address requests for deferral of punishment and waiver of required forfeitures.
See paragraphs 9.13.5. through 9.13.5.2.]


5. The accused was sentenced to ( ). The maximum imposable sentence for the offense(s) for which the

tained no other restrictions on other available forms of punishment. No further action is required on your
part regarding the pretrial agreement.


6. I have considered all matters in the record of trial, including all matters presented in the pre-sentencing

MEMORANDUM FOR (Grade, Name, SSN, Losing Unit of Accused)


FROM: (Convening Authority or SJA if excess leave is directed in the action)
SUBJECT: Required Excess Leave


1. On (date of sentence), you were sentenced by (general/special) court-martial. Your sentence, as
approved by the court-martial convening authority, included (list all elements of accused’s sentence). You
are hereby required, under Article 76a, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), to take leave pending
completion of appellate review of your conviction by court-martial. The effective date of your leave will
be determined administratively.
2. If you have ordinary leave accrued, you may elect to:


       a. Receive pay and allowances during the period of accrued leave and then continue on unpaid
required excess leave; or


       b. Receive a lump sum payment for the accrued leave, as of the day before the required excess
leave begins, and serve the entire period of required leave on unpaid excess leave. If you elect this option,
you are only entitled to base pay. This entitlement does not extend to allowances or special pay.


3. If you have no accrued leave, the entire period of required leave will be unpaid excess leave.


4. While on required excess leave, you remain a member of the United States Air Force, on active duty,
and subject to the UCMJ, to lawful orders and regulations, and to recall from required excess leave as pro-
vided in paragraph 5. You and your dependents are entitled to medical care, use of military exchange
facilities and commissaries, and other military welfare benefits while on excess leave. Since these entitle-
ments may be curtailed or terminated for cause, you and your family members must maintain proper con-
duct while using them and follow all applicable rules. In order for you to make use of these benefits, you
and your family members will be issued appropriate identification cards of limited duration. You will be
reassigned to an Air Force unit at a base nearest the appellate leave address that you provide. If transpor-
tation costs to your excess leave address exceed the transportation costs to your home of record, you will
be responsible for the excess cost under the Joint Federal Travel Regulation.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                       183


5. It is important that you provide a correct leave address and report any changes in that address. Failure
to do this may result in loss of valuable opportunities to recoup pay and allowances to which you may be
entitled if your sentence is disapproved or set aside, and it could prevent you from receiving important
instructions about the appellate review of your case. Further, you are subject to recall from required
excess leave. Failure to return promptly to your unit, if so directed by order delivered to you in person or
mailed to you at your leave address, could result in your being placed in absent without leave or desertion
status.


6. You will be informed of any significant action or decision with regard to the appellate review of your
conviction. This information and instructions will be sent to you at your leave address. If you have any
questions concerning your status or your court-martial, contact the Appellate Defense Division, AFLOA/
JAJA, 112 Luke Avenue, Room 343, Bolling AFB, DC 20032-8000 (Phone: (202) 767-1562 or toll free
1-800-414-8847). You may also contact your defense counsel, or any defense counsel or staff judge advo-
cate at any Air Force base.


7. You are required to complete the first indorsement to this memorandum. This includes providing an
appellate leave address and making your elections regarding accrued leave, if any.

                                                Chapter 10

                                     COURT-MARTIAL ORDERS

10.1. General. A Court-Martial Order (CMO) is used to promulgate the result of trial and action by the
convening authority (initial action), and any subsequent action the convening authority or higher authori-
ties take on a case after the initial action (supplementary orders), including the final order. Use the guid-
ance in RCM 1114, Appendix 17, and Figure 10.1. through Figure 10.8. to prepare and issue CMOs. See
AFMAN 51-203, Records of Trial, para. 10.5, for guidance on convening authority action in SCMs.

10.2. Separate Orders. Use a separate CMO to announce the results for each accused tried, whether or
not they were tried jointly.

10.3. Authority to Publish Orders. This chapter is the sole authority for the publication of CMOs. The
appropriate convening authority publishes CMOs, or AFLOA/JAJM may direct publication. Additionally,
AFLOA/JAJM publishes final CMOs executing sentences in cases acted on by TJAG, and AFLOA/JAJR
publishes final CMOs in cases acted on by SECAF and the President. In the event a convening authority's
command is deactivated, responsibility for publication of orders falls to:
   10.3.1. The next higher level of command exercising GCMCA;
   10.3.2. A re-designated unit, when the initial order was published under its old designation; or
   10.3.3. A unit assuming the records, personnel, functions, etc., of an inactivated or transferred unit
   that published the initial order.

10.4. Authentication (Signature). The authority issuing the CMO signs it personally, or delegates such
authority. Figure 13.1. Do not designate a representative below the grade of master sergeant. Include the
signature block of the issuing authority and, if applicable, the signature block of the person authenticating
pursuant to a delegation. Only the person actually authenticating the CMO signs it. The convening author-
ity personally must sign a supplemental order that comprises an action subsequent to the initial action.
RCM 1114(b)(2).

10.5. Orders Promulgation. See Figure 10.1. through Figure 10.8. for examples.
   10.5.1. Promulgate CMOs as follows:
       10.5.1.1. For GCMs, use a General Court-Martial Order. For SPCMs, use a Special Court-Martial
       Order.
       10.5.1.2. Number consecutively, starting with number one for each fiscal year.
       10.5.1.3. Above the heading of the first order of a fiscal year, cite the number of the last order
       published in the previous fiscal year. If no orders were published the preceding year, state there
       were no orders published in the previous fiscal year.
       10.5.1.4. Continue CMOs of commands redesignated during a fiscal year in the same series of
       numbers. Cite the authority for the redesignation above the heading of the first page in the first
       order published after redesignation.
       10.5.1.5. For SCMs, CMOs are required only when the CA takes action after the initial action.
188                                                            AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


      10.5.2. Orders Logs.
         10.5.2.1. Have a separate CMO log for each type of court-martial and each convening authority.
         For example, a single-base GCMCA will have one log for SPCMs and one log for GCMs. Also,
         each SPCMCA at a base will each have his/her own log for SPCMs. A CMO log is in addition to
         the convening orders log.
         10.5.2.2. The log should reflect the CMO number assigned to a particular case. Original CMOs
         are stored with the CMO log.

10.6. Format. Use the following format. See also Figure 10.1. through Figure 10.8.:
      10.6.1. Head-to-foot on letter size paper.
      10.6.2. Margins. Leave a two-inch margin at the top and bottom of all pages, and a one-inch margin
      on the left and right side of all pages. On the first page of an order include the order number one-half
      inch from the bottom of the page at the left margin. Number the second and succeeding pages one-half
      inch from the bottom of the page at the left margin. On the first line of the second and succeeding
      pages, state the order number, headquarters and date of the CMO; e.g., SPCMO No. 3, HQ 71 FTW,
      Vance AFB, OK, 6 May 2007.
      10.6.3. Heading. Include "DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE," the complete unit designation,
      the name of the MAJCOM abbreviated in parentheses, the mailing address, and the order number and
      date. See Figure 10.1. through Figure 10.8.
      10.6.4. Body. Do not number paragraphs in the body. Center the headings titled “SENTENCE” and
      “ACTION” and use subparagraphs under each.
      10.6.5. Announcement of the Proceedings. State the accused’s grade at the time of arraignment,
      name, social security number, branch of service, and unit. State the location of the arraignment.
      10.6.6. Grade, Name. Always reflect the grade and name of an accused in capital letters. The first
      time the name is used, state the grade or title, first name, middle initial, last name. If the name is used
      again, use only the grade or title and last name. When referencing the accused after stating a reduction
      in grade was approved, use the accused’s reduced grade (e.g., when directing excess leave in the con-
      vening authority’s action).
      10.6.7. Abbreviations. Abbreviations from a standard dictionary, or AFH 33-337, The Tongue and
      Quill, may be used if they make the order clearer.
      10.6.8. Close. In the close, use the appropriate authority line depending on who authenticates the
      order, followed by the signature block of the person authenticating. For Department of the Air Force,
      use “BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE.” For the Air Force Academy, use
      “FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT.” For TJAG use “FOR THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL.”
      For all other units, use “FOR THE COMMANDER.” No authority line is required when the conven-
      ing authority personally signs the CMO. Paralegals in grade E-7 thru E-9 must include duty titles.

10.7. Matters Unfit for Publication and Classified Matters.
      10.7.1. Unexpurgated and Expurgated CMOs. When the content of a CMO includes classified or
      other matters unfit for publication, prepare two versions of the CMO. The version with the content
      included is called the unexpurgated order. The version with the content replaced is called the expur-
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                          189


   gated order. Both the unexpurgated and the expurgated orders are the same order, and both carry the
   same order number and full distribution list. To avoid confusion between the recipients, on both ver-
   sions mark the addressees of those who are to receive the unexpurgated copies with asterisks next to
   the number of copies and add, below the distribution list, "Recipients of unexpurgated CMO." Make
   the following substitutions in the expurgated order:
       10.7.1.1. Names of children 16 years and under are always replaced with initials in both expur-
       gated and unexpurgated CMOs;
       10.7.1.2. Names of adult sex offense victims are replaced with initials;
       10.7.1.3. Obscene language and matters are replaced with asterisks; and
       10.7.1.4. Classified information is replaced with asterisks (10.7.2.2.)
   10.7.2. Distribution.
       10.7.2.1. Unexpurgated Orders. AFLOA/JAJM, AFPC/DPSFCM, the authorities of the com-
       mand where the accused is held in custody or to which transferred, and the commander of the
       place where the accused is confined receive copies of the unexpurgated CMO.
       10.7.2.2. Expurgated Orders. Include the classified information only in the order provided to
       the command where the accused is held in custody or assigned and one copy of the order accom-
       panying the original ROT forwarded to AFLOA/JAJM.

10.8. Initial Promulgating Orders. Initial CMOs promulgate the results of trial and any initial action
taken under Article 60, UCMJ. RCM 1114. It is important they accurately reflect the proceedings of the
court-martial.
   10.8.1. Preparing Orders. Prepare initial CMOs when the convening authority takes action on a
   case where the court returned any finding of guilty and a sentence.
       10.8.1.1. Orders in Cases without a Guilty Finding. Issue a CMO in trials terminated after
       arraignment but before findings (i.e., all charges dismissed or withdrawn, including upon declara-
       tion of a mistrial), and trials resulting in a finding of not guilty of all charges, including not guilty
       by reason of lack of mental responsibility and acquittals. Include the date of the termination or not
       guilty finding. Explain the circumstances of the termination. The date of the CMO is the same date
       it is published. Do not issue a CMO in trials terminated without findings before arraignment.
       10.8.1.2. Rehearing or New Trial. Indicate in an initial CMO whether a case is a rehearing or
       new trial as shown in Figure 10.5.
   10.8.2. Form.
       10.8.2.1. Date. The date of the CMO is the same date the convening authority took action. If the
       convening authority did not take action (e.g., in an acquittal), the date of the CMO is the date it is
       published.
       10.8.2.2. Charges, Specifications, Pleas and Findings. List the charges and specifications on
       which the accused was arraigned. After each charge and specification, abbreviate the plea and
       finding. Use “G” for guilty and “NG” for not guilty. If no plea was entered, state “None entered.”
       If an accused’s plea changed during trial, explain the circumstances surrounding the change. See
190                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


         A4.2.2.6. If no finding was entered, state the reason. The disposition of each charge and specifica-
         tion should be clear, including those amended, merged, withdrawn and/or dismissed.
             10.8.2.2.1. Summarized Specifications. RCM 1114(c) requires the promulgating order to
             contain at least a summary of the charges and specifications on which the accused was
             arraigned. Therefore, because the accused’s personal information is contained in the introduc-
             tory paragraph of the CMO, it need not be repeated in the specification subparagraph. How-
             ever, the remainder of the specification on which the accused was arraigned should be
             verbatim. Consider summarizing lengthy bad check specifications. Ensure any summarized
             specification includes factors such as value, amount or other such circumstances affecting
             maximum punishment. See Figure 10.1. through Figure 10.5., Figure 10.8.
             10.8.2.2.2. Lesser Included Offense (LIO); Exceptions and Substitutions. T h e c h a r g e
             should reflect any plea or findings of guilt to an LIO. When an accused pled or was found
             guilty by exceptions, the language in the specification being excepted should be verbatim. The
             plea or finding of the specification should accurately reflect the words being excepted and, if
             applicable, substituted. If found not guilty of the greater offense, but guilty of the LIO, then it
             should be NG of Art. X, but guilty of Art. Y. See Figure 10.1. and Figure 10.2.
             10.8.2.2.3. Amendments. Indicate, in parentheses and after the affected portion of the speci-
             fication, an amendment to a charge or specification made after arraignment. Figure 10.2.
             10.8.2.2.4. Renumbering of Charges. Use care in proofing CMOs involving charges and
             specifications withdrawn, dismissed or severed that result in renumbering of remaining
             charges and specifications. Charges and specifications withdrawn before arraignment do not
             appear in the CMO if the other charges were correctly renumbered. See para. 8.2.2.; Figure
             10.4.
         10.8.2.3. Sentence. State the forum that adjudged the sentence, the date the sentence was
         adjudged, and the adjudged sentence. When the convening authority orders a reprimand executed,
         place the language of the reprimand after the action and before the distribution.
         10.8.2.4. Action. Reflect the action taken by the convening authority under Article 60. On
         CMOs, the action may be summarized to the extent it does not repeat the accused’s personal infor-
         mation (which should be in the introductory paragraph). The remainder of the convening author-
         ity’s Action should be verbatim. When the convening authority modified an Action before
         publication or before the accused was notified of the action, the initial CMO reflects only the mod-
         ified action. On CMOs, the wording of an action should follow the wording in the Action verbatim
         including the accused’s personal information. If an error occurs, CMOs should not be corrected,
         but withdrawn and accomplished again.

10.9. Supplementary Orders. Promulgate any action taken on a case subsequent to the initial action in
a supplementary order. For example, use a supplementary order to suspend or remit a sentence (RCM
1108), vacate an earlier suspension (RCM 1109), terminate deferment (RCM 1101(c)(7)), and take final
action.
      10.9.1. Form. All supplementary orders contain the following:
         10.9.1.1. A cite to the initial CMO and any later CMOs modifying the findings, sentence or
         action.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                       191


      10.9.1.2. The date the sentence was adjudged and the trial forum.
      10.9.1.3. The ACM or ACMS number assigned to the case.
   10.9.2. Convening Authority Signature. The convening authority personally signs any supplemen-
   tary orders. See RCM 1114(b)(2).
   10.9.3. Order Vacating Suspension. To provide necessary data to confinement officers for compu-
   tation of time to be served in confinement, include in CMOs promulgating the vacation of a suspen-
   sion of confinement the information in MCM, Appendix 17(d), and the following additional
   information: the trial forum, the date the sentence was adjudged, the period of any deferment, any
   modification of confinement, and identifying data of any orders affecting the sentence to confinement.
   10.9.4. Article 64 Review. When the general court-martial convening authority is required to take
   action under RCM 1112(e) in a non-BCD special court-martial, ensure the CMO states the action is
   “pursuant to the authority of RCM 1112(f).” Ensure the cover and the CMO are typed or stamped “64a
   Review.”
   10.9.5. Final Orders. A final order is a supplementary order used after appellate review is complete
   to promulgate a convening authority’s action and/or reflect modifications of findings and sentence. In
   addition, use a final order after withdrawal of appellate review and when the proceedings are abated
   upon the death of an accused during appellate review. A final order should reflect the post-trial and
   appellate history of the case, including actions taken by the convening authority, the appellate courts,
   SECAF and TJAG. Ensure that the GCMCA orders execute all dishonorable or bad conduct dis-
   charges, while SECAF orders execute all dismissals. RCM 1113(c)(1)(B) and (c)(2). In cases involv-
   ing re-hearings, the final order reflects only modifications of the findings and sentence occurring after
   publication of the rehearing promulgating order.
   10.9.6. International Hold Situations. When the accused is overseas and being retained in a foreign
   country because of pending foreign criminal proceedings, consult AFJI 51-706, Status of Forces Pol-
   icies, Procedures and Information, before issuing a CMO. This includes any order ordering the sen-
   tence executed; an initial order where Article 71, UCMJ, does not require further review before it may
   be ordered executed; or a supplemental order after completion of appellate action when the latter is
   required. See also AFI 51-703, Foreign Criminal Jurisdiction.
   10.9.7. Supplementary Orders When the Accused May Be Adjudged Two Punitive Discharges.
   An accused cannot be discharged twice from the same enlistment. If an accused has an approved puni-
   tive discharge from one court-martial and is facing another court-martial which may adjudge a more
   severe punitive discharge, execute the sentence from the first court-martial, except the discharge. If
   the accused receives a dishonorable discharge in the second court-martial after receiving a bad con-
   duct discharge in the first court-martial, execute the dishonorable discharge after final appellate
   review of the second court-martial. If the approved sentence of the second court-martial includes a
   bad conduct discharge or no punitive discharge, do not delay execution of the first punitive discharge
   solely to wait for appellate review of the second court-martial. If the accused is discharged using the
   second punitive discharge, a supplementary order for the first court-martial must address the first dis-
   charge (e.g., the bad conduct discharge will not be executed because the accused was previously dis-
   charged in GCMO No. 1, this headquarters, dated 1 June 2003).

10.10. Corrected Copies.
192                                                            AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


      10.10.1. Do not amend CMOs. Issue a corrected copy to correct errors in the heading and close, the
      body of the order, the announcement of the proceedings, the action taken, and errors in typing or print-
      ing that make the order ambiguous. To correct a CMO, include the deleted matter with a line through
      it and leave it legible. If the correction is an addition, underscore the added matters. If the correction
      is a substitution, include both the deleted and the added matter, with the former lined out and the latter
      underscored. Identify it as a corrected copy in the heading. The order number and date of the corrected
      copy remains the same as the original order. In the event additional corrections are required, the head-
      ing must reflect that the order is the second, third, etc., corrected copy. Incorporate changes from a
      previous corrected copy by deleting the language lined through and retaining the added language
      without the underscore. See Figure 10.4.
      10.10.2. Do not issue a corrected copy in any case in which a convening authority or reviewing
      authority withdraws an action and substitutes a new one. Prepare a new CMO rescinding the initial
      order. See Figure 10.8.

10.11. Distribution and Number of Copies. List recipients of the CMO distribution and the number of
copies beginning two spaces below the authentication signature element at the left margin. Include the
complete mailing address. For the most current distribution list see Figure 10.9.
10.11. (AMC) Distribution and Number of Copies. For purposes of Figure 10.9., AMC/CV is the
intermediate headquarters commander. Send intermediate headquarters copies to
HQ AMC/JAAM, 102 E. Martin St., Rm N-119, Scott AFB IL 62225-5012.

10.12. Retention and Disposition of Original CMOs. SJAs are responsible for retaining the original of
their headquarters' CMOs and retiring the record sets in annual blocks in accordance with Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule, Table 51-3.

10.13. Disposition of Stamped Orders. When orders are examined and noted as legally sufficient under
Article 64(a), UCMJ, permanently place 4 copies with an original signature in the ROT. Make distribution
in accordance with paragraphs 11.4.4. and 10.12.

                                                ACTION


In the case of AIRMAN FIRST CLASS WILLIAM L. STEWART, 111-22-3333, United States Air Force,
20th Supply Squadron, only so much of the sentence as provides for a bad conduct discharge, confine-
ment for 12 months, and reduction to airman basic is approved and, except for the bad conduct discharge,
will be executed, but the execution of that portion of the sentence to bad conduct discharge is suspended
until 30 June 2007, at which time, unless the suspension is sooner vacated, the suspended part of the sen-
tence will be remitted without further action. The Air Force Corrections System is designated for the pur-
pose of confinement, and the confinement will be served therein or elsewhere as the Headquarters Air
Force Security Forces Center, Corrections Division, may direct. Unless competent authority otherwise
directs, upon completion of the sentence to confinement, AIRMAN BASIC STEWART will be required
under Article 76a, UCMJ, to take leave pending completion of appellate review.

                               CLEMENCY

Section 11A—General Information

11.1. Request for Appellate Defense Counsel. Include an AF Form 304, Request for Appellate Defense
Counsel, signed by the accused in every ROT forwarded for review by the Air Force Court of Criminal
Appeals or forwarded to The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) for examination. AFMAN 51-203, Figure
4.1. The accused's trial defense counsel assists the accused in filling out the form, obtains the accused's
signature and submits it to the trial counsel or appropriate SJA as soon as practicable after sentence
announcement. The AF Form 304 provides the accused's preferred mailing address (appellate leave
address, etc.) for all appellate review correspondence when the accused is not in a confinement facility.
An address must be provided even if the accused waives appellate review.
   11.1.1. If an accused’s death sentence by a court-martial has been approved by the President pursuant
   to Article 71, UCMJ, and the accused seeks to file a post-conviction habeas corpus petition in Federal
   civilian court concerning his/her court-martial, the accused may request a military defense counsel
   from The Judge Advocate General (TJAG). Upon receipt of the accused’s request, TJAG will detail
   military counsel under Article 70(e), UCMJ, to represent the accused in such proceedings and any
   appeals there from.

11.2. Withdrawal of Request for Appellate Defense Counsel. Use the following format to withdraw a
request for appellate defense counsel:
               I consulted with my [military trial defense counsel] [civilian defense counsel], (insert
       counsel's name), and have been advised of the action taken by the court-martial convening
       authority in my case. I received a copy of my record of trial for review. I am aware of my right to
       representation by appellate counsel. I hereby withdraw the request for appellate counsel executed
       by me on (insert date).
The accused may also decline appellate representation by checking the appropriate box on the AF Form
304. If the accused declines appellate representation, forward only the original ROT to AFLOA/JAJM for
appellate review.

11.3. Waiver or Withdrawal of Appellate Review. If an accused wishes to waive or withdraw from
appellate review, the procedures outlined in RCM 1110 must be followed. The request to waive or with-
draw from appellate review must be filed after the convening authority takes action. The waiver or with-
drawal of appellate review should be accomplished on a DD Form 2330, Waiver/Withdrawal of Appellate
Rights in General and Special Courts-Martial Subject to Review by a Court of Military Review, or DD
Form 2331, Waiver/ Withdrawal of Appellate Rights in General Courts-Martial Subject to Examination in
the Office of the Judge Advocate General. MCM, Appendix 19 & 20. Waiver or withdrawal of appellate
review bars review by the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals and by TJAG under Article 69(a). It does
not prevent later submission of an Article 69(b) application. An Article 64(a) review is required for spe-
cial and general courts-martial where an accused waives appellate review. See Section 11B below for
additional information.
214                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


Section 11B—Article 64(a), UCMJ, Judge Advocate Reviews (RCM 1112)

11.4. Article 64(a) Review (RCM 1112). An Article 64(a), UCMJ, review is required in three types of
cases: 1) all SPCMs or GCMs in which the accused waived or withdrew from appellate review under
RCM 1110; 2) in any SPCM in which the approved sentence does not include a bad conduct discharge;
and, 3) in all SCMs. A judge advocate appointed by the SJA of the officer exercising GCMCA over the
accused at the time of trial conducts the review. No review is required if the accused is found not guilty of
all offenses, the convening authority disapproved all findings of guilty or the accused is found not guilty
for all offenses only because of lack of mental responsibility for all offenses.
      11.4.1. The Article 64(a) review conforms to the requirements of RCM 1112. Indicate compliance
      with Article 64(a) with a stamped or typed notation signed and dated by the reviewing officer on the
      cover of the first volume of all copies of the ROT and on all copies of the court-martial order. Only the
      original cover and court-martial order must have an original signature, the others may be mechani-
      cally reproduced.
      11.4.2. If all judge advocates on the GCM convening authority's staff are disqualified from conduct-
      ing such a review or the GCM convening authority is disqualified from taking any required action on
      the case, the MAJCOM SJA will select another GCM convening authority and SJA to perform the
      review and take any required action. If there is no eligible convening authority in the command, or if
      the major commander is the convening authority, the MAJCOM SJA may request another MAJCOM
      commander to act or to designate a commander exercising GCM convening authority within that other
      MAJCOM to take action on the case. If agreement cannot be reached between MAJCOMs, contact
      AFLOA/JAJM for assistance in identifying an officer exercising GCM convening authority to act on
      the case.
      11.4.3. Form and Content of the Review
         11.4.3.1. Reviews of summary courts-martial will contain only those matters required by RCM
         1112(d). In those cases in which no corrective action is required by the convening authority, the
         review will consist of a stamped or typed entry on the cover of volume one of the original ROT, on
         two copies of the ROT, and on the back of the DD Form 2329, Record of Trial by Summary
         Court-Martial. The entry shall be entitled, "Article 64(a), UCMJ, Review" and shall consist of the
         conclusions required in RCM 1112(d)(1), the command of reviewer, the date, signature of the
         reviewer, and the reviewer's signature block.
         11.4.3.2. In those GCM and SPCM cases where no allegations of error have been asserted by the
         accused and no corrective action is required by the convening authority, the review will consist of
         a stamped or typed entry on the cover of volume one of the original ROT, on two copies of the
         ROT, and on the court-martial orders. The entry shall be entitled, "Article 64(a), UCMJ, Review"
         and shall consist of the conclusions required in RCM 1112(d)(1), the command of the reviewer,
         the date, signature of the reviewer, and the reviewer's signature block. If the approved sentence
         includes a bad-conduct or dishonorable discharge, the general court-martial convening authority
         personally signs the supplementary order executing the punitive discharge. Figure 10.7.
         11.4.3.3. In GCM and SPCM cases where the review addresses allegations of error by the
         accused, but no corrective action of the convening authority is required; the review will be pre-
         pared in writing, dated and signed by the reviewer, will cover the matters required by RCM
         1112(d)(1) and (2), and will include a statement that the findings and sentence are correct in law
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                     215


       and fact. The review will be attached to the ROT. The cover (DD Form 490) of volume one and all
       copies of the court-martial order will be annotated with a typed or stamped notation consisting of
       the date, signature block, the command of the reviewer, and a statement that Article 64(a), UCMJ,
       has been complied with.
       11.4.3.4. When the officer exercising GCM jurisdiction over the accused at the time the
       court-martial was convened is required to take corrective or further action under Article 64,
       UCMJ, and RCM 1112(e), the judge advocate's review will be in writing, dated and signed by the
       reviewer, and will address the matters required in RCM 1112(d)(1), (2), and (3) as well as whether
       the findings and sentence are correct in law and fact. After the convening authority takes action,
       the review and action will be included in the ROT. The cover (DD Form 490) of volume one and
       all copies of the court-martial order will be annotated with a typed or stamped notation consisting
       of the date, the signature of the reviewer, a statement that Article 64, UCMJ, has been complied
       with, the reviewer's command, and the reviewer's signature block.
          11.4.3.4.1. In cases where the review stated that corrective action was required as a matter of
          law, and the convening authority refused to take action that was at least as favorable to the
          accused as that recommended by the reviewer, the ROT, review and action of the convening
          authority shall be transmitted to TJAG through AFLOA/JAJM for review under Article 69(b),
          UCMJ. RCM 1112(g) and Appendix 16(33).
          11.4.3.4.2. If the officer taking action under Article 64, UCMJ, orders a rehearing, the ROT,
          action and court-martial order will be sent to the officer who convened the court-martial. That
          officer will determine whether a rehearing is practicable. See Section 11F. If a rehearing is to
          be held and the accused has been transferred to another command, the officer who convened
          the court-martial will make arrangements for the rehearing with the coordination of the officer
          presently exercising SPCM jurisdiction over the accused.
       11.4.3.5. Except cases requiring Article 69, UCMJ, review under RCM 1112(g), Secretarial
       action under Article 71, UCMJ, or rehearings, cases are final under Article 76, UCMJ, upon com-
       pletion of the judge advocate's review and any required action by the GCM convening authority.
       The GCM convening authority's action may execute all unexecuted portions of the sentence
       except those portions requiring Secretarial approval under Article 71, UCMJ.
          11.4.3.5.1. If the GCMCA orders a rehearing, forward the review, ROT, action, and
          court-martial order to the convening authority that convened the court-martial. This convening
          authority determines whether a rehearing is practicable.
   11.4.4. Distribution of Article 64(a) Reviews. After completing the Article 64(a) review and, when
   applicable, any action by the GCMCA under RCM 1112(f), forward the original ROT and four copies
   of the court-martial order and any supplementary orders to AFLOA/JAJM indicating compliance with
   Article 64(a) as stated in paragraph 11.4.3. Provide one copy each of the annotated court-martial order
   indicating compliance with Article 64(a) to each addressee as required by paragraph 10.11., as appli-
   cable.

Section 11C—Article 69 Review, UCMJ.

11.5. Article 69(a) Review, UCMJ (RCM 1201(b)(1)). The ROT in each GCM that is not otherwise
reviewed under Article 66 shall be examined in the Office of The Judge Advocate General if there is a
216                                                          AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


finding of guilty and the accused does not waive or withdraw his right to appellate review under Article
61.
      11.5.1. Submission of Matters by the Accused. The accused may submit matters for TJAG’s con-
      sideration. Any matters must be submitted directly to AFLOA/JAJM on or before the thirtieth (30)
      day after the date the GCMCA approved the sentence, unless the accused establishes good cause for
      not filing matters within that time. Submissions must meet the requirements of paragraph 11.6.3.
      11.5.2. Notification of Article 69(a) Examination Results. AFLOA/JAJM, or a delegee, notifies
      the convening authority's SJA of the examination results. If TJAG does not direct a review by the
      AFCCA, AFLOA/JAJM or a designee forwards three copies of the initial promulgating order to the
      convening authority’s SJA, reflecting the results of the review. The SJA serves one copy of the order
      upon the accused, obtains a receipt for it, and returns the receipt to AFLOA/JAJM. The SJA forwards
      the second signed copy of the order to the custodian of the accused's field record group for filing and
      the GCMCA’s SJA retains the third copy. If the defense counsel's name and address is included in
      matters submitted by the accused, AFLOA/JAJM sends a copy of the results to the defense counsel.
      11.5.3. Other Action by TJAG. If TJAG orders a rehearing, the procedures in Section 11F will
      apply. If TJAG forwards the case for review by AFCCA, the GCMCA’s SJA will, upon request, send
      two copies of the ROT to AFLOA/JAJM.

11.6. Application for Relief under Article 69(b), UCMJ (RCM 1201(b)(3)). The Judge Advocate
General may vacate or modify the findings or sentence, or both, reassess the sentence, or set aside the
findings or sentence and order a rehearing of a court-martial case which has become final in law but has
not been reviewed by the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (AFCCA) or TJAG. RCM 1201(b). This
applies to GCMs, SPCMs, and SCMs including those cases forwarded under RCM 1112(g)(1). The find-
ings or sentence, or both, may be reviewed on any ground specified in RCM 1201(b)(3)(A). Review of a
finding of not guilty, only by reason of lack of mental responsibility, under this rule may not extend to the
determination of lack of mental responsibility. RCM 1201(b)(3)(A), Discussion.
      11.6.1. Prerequisite of Finality of Review. An application may not be filed and will not be reviewed
      under Article 69(b), UCMJ, unless the convening authority has taken action, and a judge advocate
      completed the review and any other action required by Article 64, UCMJ.
      11.6.2. Submission of Application. The member sends the application directly to AFLOA/JAJM,
      and it is considered filed when received by that office.
         11.6.2.1. If the application concerns a trial by SCM with action taken before 1 Jul 96, the
         GCMCA’s SJA obtains the ROT, and any other statements, documents, matters admitted, or, in the
         alternative, summaries of the substance of such evidence, from the SJA for the installation at
         which the trial was held and forwards all the documents to AFLOA/JAJM.
      11.6.3. Contents of Application. Figure 11.1. is a sample format for applications. In all cases, the
      application must be written and signed by the accused, or the applicant's legal representative, under
      oath or affirmation. Defense counsel does not receive a copy of TJAG's action, unless counsel's name
      is on the application. The application must also contain:
         11.6.3.1. The accused's name, social security number, and present mailing address;
         11.6.3.2. The date and place of trial and type of court-martial;

       11.6.3.3. The sentence of the court as approved and any subsequent reduction by clemency or oth-
       erwise;
       11.6.3.4. A succinct statement of the specific relief requested and the specific grounds for the
       relief (a concise brief of the applicable law with appropriate citations is encouraged); and
       11.6.3.5. Any documentary or other evidence pertinent to the facts asserted under the specific
       grounds alleged, including copies of the court-martial order, if available.
       11.6.3.6. The application must be notarized.

Section 11D—Review by the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (AFCCA), the United States Court
of Appeals for the Armed Forces (USCAAF) and the United States Supreme Court

11.7. Briefs and Affidavits to Support Arguments of Error Filed. I f a n a s s i g n m e n t o f e r r o r i s
advanced concerning matters outside the ROT or allied papers, affidavits or other documents may support
the assigned error. These papers should be attached to and forwarded with the assigned error. Briefs sub-
mitted in support of assigned errors should be signed by the person preparing them.

11.8. AFCCA Review (RCM 1203). AFCCA reviews cases referred to it by TJAG under RCM 1201(a)
or (b)(1).
   11.8.1. Notification of the AFCCA's Decision. AFCCA’s decision is transmitted to the accused
   directly from AFLOA/JAJM or through the officer exercising GCM convening authority over the
   accused. The GCMCA’s SJA is responsible for delivery of the decision to the accused. (Except for
   cases where personal service is used, the decision should not be forwarded to the SPCM for delivery
   to the accused.) The transmittal letter to the GCMCA contains specific instructions for delivery to the
   accused and must be returned by indorsement to AFLOA/JAJM with the accused's receipt of the
   AFCCA’s decision or proof of transmittal of the decision to the accused by first class restricted deliv-
   ery, certified mail. These documents become part of the permanent records of the case and must be
   handled carefully and returned promptly.
       11.8.1.1. The accused may petition the USCAAF for review of AFCCA’s decision within 60 days
       from the earlier of:
           11.8.1.1.1. The date the accused is personally notified of AFCCA’s decision; or
           11.8.1.1.2. The date a copy of AFCCA’s decision, after being served on appellate defense
           counsel, is deposited in the United States mails for delivery by first class certified mail to the
           accused at an address provided by the accused or at the last known address listed for the
           accused in the accused's official service record. Article 67(c), UCMJ.
   11.8.2. Action Following Receipt of AFCCA’s Decision. AFLOA/JAJM must notify the accused's
   current GCMCA’s SJA when the accused petitions USCAAF for review or if a timely petition of
   review is not filed. The notice will include appropriate instructions for further processing. A final sup-
   plementary court-martial order will not be promulgated, nor will the accused be discharged, until
   these instructions are received. Delay of final action in a case is sometimes necessary for a number of
   reasons, including consideration of clemency under Article 74, UCMJ.

11.9. USCAAF Review (RCM 1204). USCAAF reviews the record in all cases: in which the sentence,
as affirmed by AFCCA, extends to death; reviewed by AFCCA which TJAG orders sent to USCAAF for
218                                                            AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


review; and reviewed by AFCCA, except those referred to it by TJAG under RCM 1201(b)(1), in which,
upon petition by the accused and on good cause shown, USCAAF has granted a review.
      11.9.1. Petition for Review by the Accused. The Rules of Practice and Procedure, USCAAF, pro-
      vide the formats for filing, either personally or through counsel, petitions for grant of review under
      Article 67(b) (3), UCMJ.
         11.9.1.1. A petition may be filed at any time after the decision of the Air Force Court of Criminal
         Appeals has been released, but within 60 days of the date the accused is notified of that decision
         or an alternate service is made. A petition is considered filed on the date the accused mails or
         delivers the petition to the court.
         11.9.1.2. Upon receipt of a copy of a petition for grant of review filed by an accused not repre-
         sented by military appellate defense counsel, TJAG will appoint counsel to represent the accused,
         unless the accused is already represented by civilian counsel and has expressly waived representa-
         tion by appointed military appellate defense counsel.
         11.9.1.3. Normally, the accused makes the decision to petition the court after receipt of AFCCA’s
         ruling and after having received the advice of counsel as to the merits of such a petition. RCM
         1204(b).

11.10. Petition for Supreme Court Review by Writ of Certiorari. Petitions for Supreme Court review
by writ of certiorari may be filed by the accused or the United States in those cases specified in Article
67a(a) and RCM 1205(a). Such petitions will be filed according to the rules of the Supreme Court of the
United States.
      11.10.1. Military appellate defense counsel may assist the accused in preparing a petition for writ of
      certiorari and provide representation before the Supreme Court when requested by the accused.
      11.10.2. When requested to do so by the Attorney General of the United States, TJAG will appoint
      appellate government counsel to represent the United States in any cases filed under Article 67a
      above.

Section 11E—Petitions for New Trial (RCM 1210).

11.11. Petition for New Trial. Petitions for new trial are prepared and processed under RCM 1210, and
are filed with AFLOA/JAJM on behalf of The Judge Advocate General. A petition for new trial may be
submitted because of newly discovered evidence or fraud on the court in any kind of court-martial within
two years after approval of the sentence by the convening authority.
      11.11.1. General Information. The petition must be in writing and contain the matters required by
      RCM 1210(c). When practicable, the petition should be typewritten and double-spaced. The petition
      will be signed under oath or affirmation by the petitioner, a person possessing the power of attorney of
      the petitioner for that purpose, or a person with the authorization of an appropriate court of law to sign
      the petition as the petitioner's representative. The member forwards the original and two copies of the
      petition and supporting documentation directly to AFLOA/JAJM. An accused may submit only one
      petition for new trial for the same reason within the two-year limitation period.
      11.11.2. Forwarding Copy of the Petition.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                      219


     11.11.2.1. If the petitioner's case is pending before the AFCCA, AFLOA/JAJM shall forward
     these documents to the court: the original petition, two copies of the petition, copies of each sup-
     porting document, and any prepared briefs. AFLOA/JAJM shall also forward a copy of the peti-
     tion and all documents to appellate defense and appellate government counsel. RCM 1210(e);
     AFCCA Rules of Practice and Procedure, Rule 22.
     11.11.2.2. If the petitioner's case is pending before USCAAF, AFLOA/JAJM shall forward these
     documents to the court: the original petition, seven copies of the petition, copies of each support-
     ing document and any prepared briefs. AFLOA/JAJM shall also forward a copy of the petition and
     all documents to both appellate defense and appellate government counsel. RCM 1210(e);
     USCAAF Rules of Practice and Procedure, Rule 29.
  11.11.3. TJAG Review of the Petition. If the petitioner's case is not pending before a court, TJAG
  or the officer(s) designated by TJAG shall review the petition. Upon request by the designated
  officer(s), TJAG shall appoint appellate defense counsel and appellate government counsel to act in
  the case. Upon such appointment, the designated officer(s) shall forward one copy of the petition and
  all documents to each appellate counsel. The designated officer(s) may direct appellate defense and
  government counsel to provide briefs in the case and upon written request or, if the designated
  officer(s) deem(s) it appropriate, may order oral arguments to be presented before the officer(s).
     11.11.3.1. Process for Filing Briefs Requiring TJAG Review of the Petition.
         11.11.3.1.1. Form and Number of Briefs. Briefs are to be typewritten, double spaced on let-
         ter size white paper in an original and three copies. Counsel shall be limited to filing one brief
         per side unless TJAG or the designated officer(s) reviewing the petition otherwise permit(s).
         11.11.3.1.2. Time for Filing. The brief on behalf of the petitioner shall be filed with AFLOA/
         JAJM within 20 days after appellate defense counsel has been appointed by TJAG and a copy
         of the petition and supporting documents have been provided counsel. Appellate government
         counsel may file a brief within 20 days the petitioner’s brief has been filed. If counsel for the
         petitioner has filed no brief, appellate government counsel will file a brief within 20 days after
         expiration of the time allowed for the filing of a brief on behalf of the petitioner. Upon written
         request, the time for filing briefs by either counsel may be extended at the discretion of TJAG
         or the designated officer(s) reviewing the petition.
     11.11.3.2. Oral Arguments. If ordered by the designated officer(s), oral arguments shall be heard
     after written briefs have been filed.
         11.11.3.2.1. Notice. The designated officer(s) shall give appellate counsel at least 10 days
         notice of the time and place of oral arguments.

         11.11.3.2.3. Number of Counsel; Opening and Closing. The designated officer(s) may
         limit the number of counsel making an oral argument. The counsel for the petitioner has the
         right to make opening and closing arguments.
         11.11.3.2.4. Failure to Appear. If appellate counsel fails to appear at the time and place set
         for oral argument may be regarded as a waiver thereof and the designated officer(s) may pro-
         ceed on the case as submitted without argument or may continue the case for argument at a
         later date, giving due notice thereof.
220                                                          AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


             11.11.3.2.5. Presence of Petitioner. The petitioner does not have a right to be present at the
             time of oral arguments before the designated officer(s).
         11.11.3.3. Opinion and Action. A memorandum opinion and an action shall be prepared by the
         designated officer(s) for consideration by TJAG. After the action has been signed, AFLOA/JAJM,
         shall cause a copy thereof to be served on petitioner and shall take such action as may be necessary
         to carry out the orders of TJAG as contained in the action.

Section 11F—Rehearings and Other Remedial Actions

11.12. Cases Remanded by the Appellate Courts. When a decision of the Supreme Court, USCAAF,
or AFCCA directs or authorizes further proceedings, such as a rehearing, a limited hearing, or a new
action by the convening authority (CA), reasonable efforts must be made to locate the accused and pro-
vide the accused with a copy of the decision. Further proceedings in AFCCA cases need not be delayed,
however, solely to permit an accused to petition for a grant of review or otherwise appeal the matter. Any
special instructions deemed necessary to carry out the mandate of the Court will be transmitted by
AFLOA/JAJM with the remanded ROT.
      11.12.1. Pursuant to Article 76(a), an accused may only be placed on involuntary appellate leave
      when the approved sentence includes a punitive discharge. When an appellate court sets aside the
      action or the sentence, the accused should be taken off of appellate leave. Figure 11.2.

11.13. Procedure When Rehearing is Authorized (RCM 810). When an order of a reviewing or con-
vening authority, an order of TJAG, a decision of AFCCA, a mandate issued by USCAAF, or a judgment
of the Supreme Court authorizes a rehearing on the findings or sentence, the following procedures apply:
      11.13.1. Notification of the Convening Authority and Identification of the Responsible Conven-
      ing Authority. AFLOA/JAJM, or the Article 64, UCMJ, reviewing officer, as appropriate, sends a
      transmittal letter, and a copy of the pertinent decision, mandate, or order to the original convening
      authority’s SJA (or the current CA if the original CA no longer exists). If the accused is no longer
      within the command of the original convening authority, a courtesy copy will be forwarded to the
      accused's current CA with jurisdiction to convene the type of court-martial involved.
         11.13.1.1. The original court-martial convening authority is the CA who approved the accused’s
         sentence. The original CA is the responsible convening authority if the accused is still under his or
         her jurisdiction.
         11.13.1.2. If the accused is no longer under the jurisdiction of the original CA, the original CA
         decides whether to remain the responsible CA or transfer his or her responsibilities for the case to
         the officer presently exercising authority over the accused to convene the type of court-martial
         involved. If transferred, the current CA becomes the responsible CA.
             11.13.1.2.1. If the original CA remains the responsible CA and determines that a rehearing
             should be held, he or she will request that the accused be returned for the purpose of rehearing
             or will reach an understanding as to situs with the officer presently exercising court-martial
             convening authority over the accused or with another officer exercising court martial conven-
             ing authority.
         11.13.1.3. If the original CA no longer exists, the accused’s current CA, exercising authority over
         the accused to convene the type of court-martial involved, is the responsible CA.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                       221


   11.13.2. Receipt of Decision and Speedy Trial Clock. Receipt of decision by the original CA’s (or
   the current CA if the original CA no longer exists) SJA triggers the speedy trial clock for both rehear-
   ings on findings and rehearings on sentence only. In a sentence-only rehearing, an accused is “brought
   to trial” at the first Article 39a session. U.S. v. Becker, 53 MJ 229 (CAAF 2000); RCM 707(b)(3)(D).
   11.13.3. Notification of the Accused and Counsel. When a post-trial review or action directs or
   authorizes further proceedings, the responsible convening authority’s SJA must make reasonable
   efforts to locate and provide both the accused and trial defense counsel with a copy of the document
   requiring additional action. Ensure receipts are accomplished.
   11.13.4. Action. The responsible CA should ensure action is taken consistent with the post-trial
   directions from the reviewing or appellate authority. The responsible CA will publish a supplementary
   court-martial order indicating either:
       11.13.4.1. A rehearing is ordered before another court-martial to be designated. See Figure 10.5.
       for sample language for rehearing on sentence]; or
       11.13.4.2. If a rehearing on sentence is impracticable, that the sentence has been set-aside and a
       sentence of no punishment is approved; or
       11.13.4.3. If a rehearing on findings is impracticable, that the findings of guilt and the sentence
       have been set aside and the charges are dismissed.
   11.13.5. Ensure appropriate coordination is made with all counsel, and military judge.
   11.13.6. Sentence Reassessment. When partial findings have been approved and a rehearing as to
   other offenses and the sentence ordered, the convening authority may, if specifically authorized by
   either AFCCA or USCAAF, reassess the sentence based on the approved findings of guilty and dis-
   miss the remaining charges, if any. RCM. 1107(e)(1)(B)(iii), Discussion.

11.14. Referral. Whether re-referring the matter to a rehearing in full or for a limited purpose ensure that
the following actions are accomplished:
   11.14.1. The responsible CA directs the rehearing. This may be done at any location the convening
   authority determines to be appropriate. If the rehearing is held at a location requiring the accused to
   travel, the accused should be placed on TDY. See Figure 6.8.
   11.14.2. A military judge is detailed. The military judge may be the same as in the original trial or a
   new one may be detailed.
   11.14.3. A new convening order is published with all new members.
   11.14.4. A new referral indorsement in same form as on page 2 of the Charge Sheet, DD Form 458, is
   completed following normal rules of referral.
       11.14.4.1. The appropriate instructions concerning the rehearing are incorporated on the referral
       form.
       11.14.4.2. The new referral is attached to the original referral. (See 4.9.)

11.15. Record of Trial and Post-Rehearing Concerns
   11.15.1. The original ROT and any copies must remain intact, except for documents needed for rein-
   troduction at rehearing, such as the charge sheet and exhibits, if required.
222                                                          AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


      11.15.2. Any documents withdrawn from the original ROT and used at the rehearing should be sub-
      stituted in the record and all copies with a description of the document, reasons for withdrawal, and
      new location of the document should be included. Do not withdraw the original copies of a decision of
      a court, action of a convening authority, post-trial review or recommendation, pretrial advice, and
      Article 32 report of investigation.
      11.15.3. If the accused served confinement resulting from the original trial, the convening authority’s
      new action must reflect that the accused will be credited for the time served.
      11.15.4. The promulgating order must indicate the case is a rehearing. See Figure 10.5.
      11.15.5. The record of the rehearing is a separate volume from the original ROT. Place the record of
      rehearing on top of the original ROT. Other volumes are renumbered as appropriate.
      11.15.6. Forward the original and two copies of the rehearing record along with original ROT to
      AFLOA/JAJM.

11.16. DuBay Hearing. A DuBay hearing is a post-trial hearing ordered by an appellate court for the lim-
ited purpose of obtaining further evidence on a matter under consideration by the court. While the MCM
does not explicitly address this type of limited fact-finding hearing, DuBay procedure is a well-estab-
lished means to address an ambiguity or omission in the record; or to dispose of a claim of error before
necessary witnesses disperse, memories fade, or witnesses became unavailable. United States v. DuBay,
37 C.M.R. 411 (C.M.A. 1967). DuBay hearings on various matters may be directed by the CAAF,
AFCCA, convening and supervisory authorities, or the detailed military judge on his or her own motion
prior to authentication of the ROT, so long as the subject of the proceeding is "one that can be verified
without material prejudice to the substantial rights of the accused." U. S. v. Brickey, 16 M.J. 258 (C.M.A.
1983). The following procedures apply when a DuBay hearing is ordered:
      11.16.1. Notification of Convening Authority. AFLOA/JAJM sends a letter of transmittal and a
      copy of the pertinent mandate or order to the SJA of the convening authority who exercised such
      authority over the accused at the time of the trial (or the current CA if the original CA no longer
      exists). If the accused is no longer within the command of the original convening authority, a courtesy
      copy will be forwarded to the accused's current CA who has the authority to convene the type of
      court-martial involved.
         11.16.1.1. The responsible CA, as identified in 11.13.1., must ensure action is taken consistent
         with the post-trial directions from the authority directing the DuBay hearing. The responsible CA
         will publish a supplementary court-martial order reflecting post-trial action on the case.
         11.16.1.2. Receipt of Decision and Time Standards. There are no formal time standards for com-
         pletion of the hearing, however the matter should be expedited as appellate review is pending.
         Additionally, the appellate court directing the hearing generally specifies a date by which the pro-
         cess must be completed. Any time extension requests require coordination with AFLOA/JAJG
         through AFLOA/JAJM.
      11.16.2. Notification of the Accused and Counsel. When a post-trial review or action directs a
      DuBay hearing, the responsible convening authority’s SJA must make reasonable efforts to locate and
      provide both the accused and trial defense counsel with a copy of the document requiring additional
      action. Ensure receipts are accomplished.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                       223


       11.16.2.1. The accused should be returned to active duty status for the limited purpose of partici-
       pating in the DuBay hearing. Figure 11.3.
       11.16.2.2. Appointment Letter. The SJA prepares a letter for the responsible CA to sign directing
       the DuBay hearing to take place. Figure 11.4.
   11.16.3. Detail of a Military Judge. After appropriate coordination, the SJA drafts a letter for the
   convening authority requesting a military judge be detailed and directing a hearing date to be sched-
   uled. A military judge is detailed to a DuBay hearing in the same manner as detailed to any court-mar-
   tial.
   11.16.4. DuBay hearings are conducted in accordance with Article 39(a), UCMJ.
   11.16.5. Exhibits. Number items admitted as evidence at the hearing numerically, beginning with
   "Hearing Exhibit 1."
   11.16.6. Record of Hearing and Post Hearing Action. Prepare a verbatim record of the hearing,
   unless otherwise directed by the authority ordering the hearing. Authenticate the transcript of the hear-
   ing in the same format as required for ROTs. Return the original ROT and the original DuBay tran-
   script and two copies of the DuBay transcript to AFLOA/JAJM.

Section 11G—Remission and Suspension Under Article 74, UCMJ

11.17. General Information. After the action is published or the accused has been officially notified of
the action, the SECAF has the authority to remit or suspend any part or amount of the unexecuted part of
any sentence, except one approved by the President, unless the SECAF delegated such authority in this
section.
   11.17.1. The term "unexecuted part of a sentence" includes that part which has been approved and
   ordered executed but which has not been carried out (e.g., punitive discharges or dismissals not
   ordered into execution, unserved confinement, hard labor without confinement or restriction, and
   uncollected forfeitures).

11.18. Authority Reserved to the SECAF. Only the SECAF may remit or suspend, any part or amount
of the unexecuted part of the sentences listed below. This limitation does not apply to the convening
authority's powers under RCM 1107; Article 60, UCMJ.
   11.18.1. Any sentence of a person convicted by a military tribunal, under SECAF’s jurisdiction,
   resulting from the President's commutation of a sentence of death to a lesser punishment (RCM 1206
   (b)(3);
   11.18.2. Any sentence the SECAF approved and ordered into execution;
   11.18.3. A dismissal, dishonorable discharge, or bad conduct discharge that is imposed for the con-
   viction of an offense when a sentence to death is authorized by the MCM;
   11.18.4. Those referred to the SECAF for action by commanders authorized to exercise Article 74,
   UCMJ. Commanders are encouraged to forward to AFLOA/JAJR for SECAF decision those cases
   involving issues most appropriate for resolution at the Air Force policy level.

11.19. Authority of TJAG. TJAG may exercise SECAF authority under Article 74(a), UCMJ, and remit
or suspend in whole or in part any unexecuted part of a sentence, with the exception of those cases speci-
224                                                          AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


fied in 11.17. The Director, USAF Judiciary, may act for TJAG to remit or suspend up to 90 days of an
approved sentence to confinement.

11.20. Authority of the Accused's Commander. Except in cases listed in 11.17. and 11.18., the com-
mander of the accused who has the authority to convene a court-martial of the kind which adjudged the
sentence may suspend or remit any part or amount of the unexecuted part of an accused’s sentence
adjudged by a summary court-martial or a SPCM, except for a BCD, regardless of whether the person act-
ing has previously approved the sentence.
      11.20.1. A commander exercising only SPCMCA over the command to which the accused is
      assigned may not remit a BCD, but may suspend a BCD only in the initial action.
      11.20.2. A commander exercising GCMCA over the command to which the accused is assigned may
      remit or suspend any part or amount of the unexecuted part of any sentence except in cases listed in

Leave


MEMORANDUM FOR (Accused)


FROM: HQ 11 WG/CC
        20 MacDill Blvd, Room 240
        Bolling AFB DC 20332-0100


SUBJECT: Required Excess Leave for (accused)


1. On 15 May 2006, your sentence to a bad-conduct discharge was approved by the convening authority
for 11 WG and you were directed to take involuntary leave pursuant to Article 76(a), Uniform Code of
Military Justice. On 6 July 2007, the [Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals][United States Court of
Appeals for the Armed Forces] set aside the [action of the convening authority][findings of guilt and the
sentence][sentence].


[Set aside action of the convening authority]


2. Because the Court set aside the action of the convening authority, you must elect one of the following
options:


        a. Continue on voluntary appellate leave, in a non-pay status, until a new action of the convening
authority is taken in your case; or


       b. Be restored to active duty and placed in a casual status at HQ 11 Wing, Bolling AFB.


3. If your sentence, which included a bad-conduct discharge, is approved, your voluntary excess leave,
should you elect it, will be cancelled and you will then be required, under Article 76(a), Uniform Code of
Military Justice (UCMJ), to take involuntary leave pending completion of appellate review of your con-
viction by court-martial.


4. While on voluntary excess leave, you will remain a member of the United States Air Force on active
duty and subject to the UCMJ, to lawful orders and regulations, and to recall from required leave as pro-
vided in paragraph 5. You and your family members are entitled to medical care, use of military exchange
facilities and commissaries, and other military welfare benefits. Because these entitlements may be cur-
tailed or terminated for cause, you and your family members must maintain proper conduct while using
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                        227


them and follow all applicable rules. In order for you to make use of these benefits, you and your family
members will be issued appropriate identification cards of limited duration.


5. It is important that you provide a correct leave address and report any changes in address. Failure to do
so may result in loss of valuable opportunities to recoup pay and allowances to which you may be entitled
if your sentence is disapproved or set aside, and it could prevent you from receiving important instruc-
tions. Further, you are subject to recall from voluntary excess leave. Failure to return promptly to your
unit, if so directed by order delivered to you in person or mailed to you at your leave address, could result
in your being placed in absent without leave or desertion status.

[Set aside findings of guilt and sentence][sentence]


2. Because the [Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals][United States Court of Appeals for the Armed
Forces] set aside the [findings and sentence][sentence] in your case, you are no longer on required excess
leave and will be restored to active duty. You are required to contact the Military Personnel Flight at Bol-
ling AFB on (date). If you have any questions, contact SSgt Mary Jones, 11 MSS/DPM, at 202-111-2222.

AUTOMATED MILITARY JUSTICE ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (AMJAMS)

Section 12A—General Information

12.1. Purpose. The purpose of AMJAMS is to collect data pertaining to investigations, nonjudicial pun-
ishment imposed pursuant to Article 15, UCMJ, trials by court-martial, and related military justice activ-
ity. The information collected is required:
      12.1.1. To conduct statistical studies that measure disciplinary rates and trends and evaluate military
      justice involvement as it affects the quality of the force and the personnel needs of the service;
      12.1.2. To provide various management reports to judge advocate personnel at all levels;
      12.1.3. To provide statistical data to the Department of Defense concerning military justice;
      12.1.4. To provide raw data to the Defense Incident Based Reporting System (DIBRS); and,
      12.1.5. To reply to inquiries concerning military justice.

12.2. Program Uses. AMJAMS collects detailed information on offenses and processing timelines as
well as demographic information on the participants in the judicial and nonjudicial punishment process.
The new improved management information from AMJAMS provides effective management tools for
use by Headquarters USAF, major commands, general and special court-martial jurisdictions, the judi-
ciary, and the appellate divisions. When used properly, the information will assist in eliminating or high-
lighting excessive processing delays and in monitoring the current status of military justice actions from
the investigation stage through to completion of the appellate process.

12.3. Policy. AMJAMS inputs are to be timely, complete, and accurate. Timely collecting, reporting, and
processing of military justice information is essential to staff judge advocates at all levels. Inputs are to be
completed as soon as possible after a military justice “event” occurs in a case, beginning with the Investi-
gation Module. For the purpose of this Instruction, “events” are defined as data fields in AMJAMS. If the
data field is applicable to a case, an input should be made as soon as the data is available. Refer to
AMJAMS online Help Topics in the AMJAMS client for detailed instructions on data entry. The data will
be accurate at the time of input and updated as the need arises.

Section 12B—Data Entry

12.4. Responsibilities.
      12.4.1. Base and GCM staff judge advocate personnel are primarily responsible for all AMJAMS
      data entry except appellate data.
         12.4.1.1. Paralegals are the primary individuals responsible for data entry. Attorneys are autho-
         rized edit rights, only after written approval from their MAJCOM staff judge advocates. This priv-
         ilege is ONLY authorized on a case-by-case basis.
         12.4.1.2. GCM staff judge advocate personnel are primarily responsible for reviewing all
         AMJAMS inputs for completeness and accuracy except appellate data.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                         231


   12.4.2. JAJM and appellate court personnel are primarily responsible for data entry in the TJAG and
   appellate folders.

Section 12C—Investigations

12.5. Investigations. New cases should be opened in AMJAMS as investigations immediately upon
becoming aware of a potential Article 15, courts-martial, or circumstances reportable as a special interest
case.
   12.5.1. Special Interest Cases. If the case contains one of the qualifying criteria listed in Section
   12E of this Instruction, designate the case as a special interest case by selecting ‘YES,’ special interest
   reporting required. If the case is disposed of through an Article 15 and falls within the reporting
   requirements of Section 12E, report the case to JAJM through AMJAMS until punishment is
   imposed. If the case is disposed of through court-martial and falls within the reporting requirements of
   Section 12E, report the case to JAJM through AMJAMS until sentence is announced or other termi-
   nating disposition. If the case does not qualify for special interest reporting to JAJM, but does meet
   MAJCOM or NAF special interest reporting requirements, select ‘YES’ NAF/MAJCOM reporting
   required on the NAF/MAJCOM Reporting pane.
   12.5.2. Member data. This branch has seven tabs: Member, Race, Pay, Career, Duty Status, Prior
   Actions, and Commander. All of them are equally important and for the most part, self-explanatory.
   The information found in these tabs is automatically entered by AMJAMS from a file that is updated
   by AFPC monthly. These fields can be edited if changes have occurred in personal data since the
   AFPC update.
   12.5.3. Pending Offenses. All offenses and violations being investigated must be entered in this
   module regardless of jurisdiction. For civilian investigations, input offenses that closely coincide with
   the civilian code violations.
   12.5.4. Text Fields. Three text fields are provided for specific types of data. Information that is or
   should be entered in a specific field elsewhere in the database should not be entered in any text field.
       12.5.4.1. Current Case Status. Enter data describing the current status of the case. Valid data for
       this field may include information regarding situations that may delay or otherwise affect the pro-
       cessing of the case, i.e. “Commander TDY until ______; Accused hospitalized until ______;
       Defense counsel unavailable until _______; etc. Enter a “Current as of” date each time this field is
       updated.
       12.5.4.2. Case Notes. Legal offices may enter day-to-day notes in this field that provide useful
       information in the administrative processing of the case.
       12.5.4.3. Narrative Description. Enter enough information in sufficient detail to provide a clear
       understanding of the facts and circumstances involved in the case (who, what, when, where, how)
       for each offense investigated. This field should be updated as significant events occur. Also, do
       not put any information in this field that could compromise an ongoing investigation.
   12.5.5. Investigation Personnel. The folder has three tabs – Defense Counsel, Investigation POC,
   and Base POC. Use the local look-up tables to add these persons under their affiliated tabs. If there is
   more than one counsel, add them as appropriate. When the investigation is converted to an Article 15
   or court-martial, these names will copy down to Article 15 personnel folder or trial personnel folder.
232                                                            AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


      12.5.6. Pretrial Restraint. If pretrial restraint is imposed on the member (military or civilian), add
      this folder and enter the type of restraint imposed, dates imposed, and date of the pretrial hearing if
      applicable.
      12.5.7. Case Disposition. Cases should be disposed of immediately upon the commander’s determi-
      nation of forum. For cases processed by civilian authorities, the cases will remain in the investigation
      status until resolution of alleged offenses.

Section 12D—Defense Incident Based Reporting System

12.6. DIBRS. In 1996 the Department of Defense (DoD) established a comprehensive database called
the “Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS)” to track criminal and other high interest inci-
dents involving personnel from “cradle to grave.” The authority for this system is DoD Directive 7730.47,
15 Oct 96 and its implementing guidance is DoD 7730.47-M, Manual for Defense Incident-Based Report-
ing System. The system was designed to meet the reporting requirements mandated by Congress in the
Uniform Federal Crime Reporting Act of 1988; the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1994; and
recurring requests for overall DoD law enforcement data.
      12.6.1. DIBRS Reporting. Within DIBRS there are eight reporting segments: administrative,
      offense, property, victim, offender/arrestee, commander’s action, results of trial, and corrections. SF
      and AFOSI are primarily responsible for the segments and, in most cases, will initiate the reporting
      process when they receive a credible report of a criminal incident. JA is only responsible for the
      “results of trial” segment. The data for this segment is gathered through the use of AMJAMS and most
      of it is already entered by a paralegal. There are, however, three additional DIBRS screens in
      AMJAMS that must now be completed for each court-martial.
         12.6.1.1. DIBRS Incident. Enter the offender ID, FBI Location number and Incident number in
         this section. Data for these three fields are obtained from the lead agency investigating the case.
         12.6.1.2. Miscellaneous. Enter the UIC that corresponds with the location of the court-martial
         and the UIC of the convening authority. Be aware that these codes may differ. Enter the promul-
         gating order number and date of the order. If the investigated offenses resulted in disposition other
         than trial, indicate the disposition in the trial clearance field. Enter the number of days credited for
         pretrial confinement, and then enter the number of pretrial confinement days.
         12.6.1.3. Notification. Enter the number of victims and witnesses notified before and after trial.

Section 12E—Pretrial

12.7. Pretrial. All folders and corresponding fields that apply to a particular case must be completed in
their entirety. AMJAMS report criteria and logic may be dependent upon any number of fields in
AMJAMS and not necessarily those used at base or NAF level. It is imperative for database integrity that
the fields within the area of control at base and NAF level be completed if applicable to the case.
      12.7.1. Folders. Add folders to the AMJAMS case tree as cases progress through the military justice
      process. Do not add folders that do not apply (e.g. If the member did not request IMDC, do not add
      that folder, etc.).
         12.7.1.1. Pretrial Information. This folder contains the Case Ready Date. The date is copied to
         this folder from the Investigation module and can only be edited in the Investigation module.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                     233


       12.7.1.1.1. Discharge Request. Annotate whether the member requested discharge in lieu of
       trial or for officers, resignation for the good of the service (RILO). If the member initially does
       not request discharge, but later changes his option, update the discharge fields using the same
       discharge folder to reflect the request and the action taken.
       12.7.1.1.2. Pretrial Restraint. The restraint folder may be added at any time the need arises.
       Add every instance of pretrial restraint, reflect all hearing dates, and the date restraint was ter-
       minated in this folder. If pretrial restraint does not terminate until the date of sentence or
       acquittal, the termination date will be entered automatically.
       12.7.1.1.3. Charges Preferred. Pending offenses from the Investigation module will be cop-
       ied to the Charges Preferred folder. If an offense entered in Pending Offenses will not be pre-
       ferred, delete that offense from Charges Preferred. If an offense will be added that was not in
       Pending Offenses, add the offense in the Charges Preferred module. Once an offense has been
       preferred, only AMJAMS Administrators can delete the preferral date and offense. After all
       applicable data is entered in the ‘Charges Preferred’ module, print the Charge Sheet (DD Form
       458) from AMJAMS.
          12.7.1.1.3.1. Accuser. Enter data on the accuser (individual causing charges to be pre-
          ferred).
       12.7.1.1.4. Special Offense Identifiers. Offenses requiring separate, individualized tracking
       have been assigned special offense identifiers. A list of the special offense identifiers can be
       found on the AMJAMS web page maintained by AFLOA/JAS. If the case involves offenses
       falling within the special offense category, please identify the offense by selecting the corre-
       sponding special offense identifier. A drop down list of potential identifiers is available for
       your convenience. Note: More than one special offense identifier may apply to each offense,
       i.e., 120-A, Rape, could use both “40” sex offender registration and “45” DNA processing
       required.
       12.7.1.1.5. Trial Personnel. Enter data pertaining to all trial participants in their respective
       categories (i.e., Defense Counsel, Trial Counsel, Court Reporter, etc.). Add as many partici-
       pants as applicable, with the exception of the military judge. Use this tab first to reflect the
       military judge assigned to the case. If you need to add another military judge, add a separate
       JUDGE item. Do not delete personnel that participated in any part of the case if they are sub-
       sequently replaced or removed from the case. Ensure “current” is checked if the person is the
       current participant. Mark this block even if the participant is the only one is their category.
       12.7.1.1.6. Judge. This is available for personnel to enter data on an additional military judge
       if required. It contains data on the trial judge and comments.
       12.7.1.1.7. Article 32 Investigations. (General courts-martial only). If the accused waives
       the Article 32 hearing, annotate the date waived in this module. Enter the applicable dates of
       the Article 32 hearing from the date the Investigating Officer is appointed to the date the report
       was completed.
          12.7.1.1.7.1. Investigating Officer. Enter data pertaining to the Investigating Officer
          appointed by the convening authority on this tab.

Section 12I—Time Management of Case Processing

12.15. In General. SJAs must give managerial attention to all time standards prescribed by the MCM,
statutes, case law, and regulations.
      12.15.1. Coordination with AFOSI. SJAs should develop local procedures with their servicing
      AFOSI detachment commander to coordinate with agents as early as possible in the investigative
      stages of the case to ensure limited investigative resources are focused on gathering relevant evidence
      in a timely manner.
      12.15.2. Time Management. Expeditious processing of courts-martial is essential to minimize dis-
      ruptions in the Air Force mission, the lives of victims, witnesses, and the accused, and to minimize Air
      Force costs. The impartial and timely administration of military justice helps sustain good order and
      discipline. SJAs and chiefs of military justice, at all levels of command, should regularly analyze
      available AMJAMS data relating to each segment of court processing over which they have signifi-
      cant control to determine specific areas for improvement and implement appropriate management
      measures to maximize effectiveness and efficiency. The following Air Force court-martial metrics are
      established to assist in expediting the administration of justice.
         12.15.2.1. Convene 80% of all courts-martial (arraignment) on a Negotiated Trial Date within 45
         days after the accused is served (RCM 602).
         12.15.2.2. Complete 80% of all general courts-martial (Preferral Date - CA Action Date) within
         160 days.
         12.15.2.3. Complete 80% of all special courts-martial (Preferral Date - CA Action Date) within
         75 days.
         12.15.2.4. Complete 80% of all summary courts-martial (Preferral Date - CA Action) within 30
         days.
         12.15.2.5. Forward all court-martial ROTs to AFLOA/JAJM within 14 days of CA Action.
         12.15.2.6. Complete 80% of all Article 66, UCMJ, and appellate reviews within 270 days (Date
         AFLOA/JAJM receives the ROT - AFCCA Decision Date).
      12.15.3. Staff judge advocates are expected to ensure expeditious processing of cases by closely
      monitoring reports and making improvements in areas where the military justice process lags unnec-
      essarily.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                    239


Section 12J—Reports

                         MISCELLANEOUS MILITARY JUSTICE MATTERS

Section 13A—Staff Judge Advocate

13.1. Staff Judge Advocate-Title. Unless otherwise specified by TJAG, the senior officer of TJAG's
Corps on a commander's staff is designated the "Staff Judge Advocate" of that command. All other judge
advocate officers assigned to a command are designated "Assistant Staff Judge Advocates." Use these
titles for pretrial advice, post-trial recommendations and court-martial orders. The Senior Assistant Staff
Judge Advocate uses the title "Acting Staff Judge Advocate" when the Staff Judge Advocate is absent or
ineligible to act in a particular case. In all other matters, titles such as "Deputy Staff Judge Advocate,"
"Chief, Military Justice division," and "Executive Officer," may be used.
      13.1.1. Convening authorities may delegate military justice administrative duties to the Staff Judge
      Advocate (SJA) or any other attorney assigned to the servicing SJA's office. Figure 13.1. is a sample
      delegation letter. In addition to the duties listed in Figure 13.1., convening authorities may delegate
      any other military justice administrative duties not expressly requiring convening authority action.
      When signing a military justice matter for the convening authority, use the signature element, "FOR
      THE COMMANDER."

13.3. AFLOA/JAJM Requests for Information.
   13.3.1. In General. AFLOA/JAJM routinely receives inquiries concerning military justice actions
   against Air Force members and relies heavily on information from bases to answer the inquiries. A
   complete, accurate and timely response to requests for information is critical. Do not construe
   requests as criticism of case handling, nor view them as a mandate for particular action. AFLOA/
   JAJM may communicate directly with any organizational level. When providing information, send
   informational copies of replies to intermediate levels of command and through MAJCOM level to
   AFLOA/JAJM to ensure all are informed.
   13.3.1. (AMC) In General. Due to the time sensitivity of these responses, the suspense date to
   AFLOA/JAJM must be met. Ensure required replies are provided in a timely manner to AFLOA/
   JAJM, with copies concurrently provided to 18 AF/JA and HQ AMC/JA. Where time permits, coor-
   dinate the response with 18 AF/JA and HQ AMC/JA before responding to AFLOA/JAJM.

Section 13D—Extrajudicial Statements to the Public Relating to Criminal Proceedings and Release of
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                       243


Court-Martial Records.

13.5. General. Information may not be disseminated if there is a substantial likelihood that release will
prejudice a criminal proceeding. The determination of whether a release is permissible includes an assess-
ment of the type of information to be released and its source, the type of proceeding, and the stage of the
proceeding.
   13.5.1. The release of information relating to a criminal proceeding is subject to the Air Force Rules
   of Professional Conduct, the Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice, implementing directives, secu-
   rity requirements, judicial orders protecting information and applicable laws, such as the Privacy Act,
   the Freedom of Information Act, the Victim and Witness Protection Act,
   13.5.2. Air Force representatives must not encourage or assist news media in photographing or tele-
   vising an accused being held or transported in custody.
   13.5.3. This section does not apply to the release of information by military or civilian defense coun-
   sel. However, defense counsel, both military and civilian, must comply with the Air Force Rules of
   Professional Conduct and the Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice, portions of which address trial
   publicity by defense counsel. Military defense counsel must comply with the requirements and restric-
   tions of the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act with regard to trial publicity.

13.6. Extrajudicial Statements. Extrajudicial statements are oral or written statements made outside of
a criminal proceeding that a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public com-
munication. The question of whether a statement is extrajudicial will depend upon the circumstances.
SJAs should consult with their MAJCOM SJAs when there is a question about the nature of a statement
proposed for release.
   13.6.1. There are valid reasons for making certain information available to the public in the form of
   extrajudicial statements. However, extrajudicial statements should not be used for the purpose of
   influencing the course of a criminal proceeding. Usually, extrajudicial statements should include only
   factual matters and should not offer subjective observations or opinions.
       13.6.1.1. The release of extrajudicial statements is a command responsibility. The installation
       SJA and the installation public affairs officer (PAO) must work closely together to provide
       informed advice to the commander. If the extrajudicial statement is based on information con-
       tained in agency records, the OPR for the record should also coordinate on the extrajudicial state-
       ment prior to release. The convening authority responsible for the criminal proceeding makes the
       ultimate decision about release of extrajudicial statements relating to that criminal proceeding.
       MAJCOM (or equivalent) commanders may withhold release authority from subordinate com-
       manders. In high interest cases, the SJA and the PAO should consult with their MAJCOM repre-
       sentatives.
       13.6.1.2. The SJA, trial counsel and defense counsel must ensure investigators, law enforcement
       personnel, employees and other persons assisting or associated with counsel do not make extraju-
       dicial statements counsel are prohibited from making.
   13.6.2. Extrajudicial Statements Which Generally May Not Be Made. Extrajudicial statements
   relating to the following matters ordinarily have a substantial likelihood of prejudicing a criminal pro-
   ceeding and generally should not be made:
244                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


         13.6.2.1. The existence or contents of any confession, admission or statement by the accused or
         the accused’s refusal or failure to make a statement;
         13.6.2.2. Observations about the accused’s character and reputation;
         13.6.2.3. Opinions regarding the accused’s guilt or innocence;
         13.6.2.4. Opinions regarding the merits of the case or the merits of the evidence;
         13.6.2.5. References to the performance of any examinations, tests or investigative procedures
         (e.g., fingerprints, polygraph examinations, and ballistics or laboratory tests), the accused’s failure
         to submit to an examination or test, or the identity or nature of physical evidence expected to be
         presented;
         13.6.2.6. Statements concerning the identity, expected testimony, disciplinary or criminal records,
         or credibility of prospective witnesses;
         13.6.2.7. The possibility of a guilty plea or other disposition of the case other than procedural
         information concerning such processes;
         13.6.2.8. Before sentencing, facts regarding the accused’s disciplinary or criminal record, includ-
         ing nonjudicial punishment, prior court-martial convictions, and other arrests, indictments, con-
         victions, or charges. Do not release information about nonjudicial punishment or administrative
         actions even after sentencing unless admitted into evidence. This rule does not prohibit, however,
         a statement that the accused has no prior criminal or disciplinary record; and,
         13.6.2.9. Information trial counsel knows or has reason to know would be inadmissible as evi-
         dence in a trial.
      13.6.3. Extrajudicial Statements That May Be Made Under Some Circumstances Regardless of
      the Stage of the Proceedings. Subject to the limitations in 13.5.1. and 13.5.2., the following extraju-
      dicial statements may be made when deemed necessary regardless of the stage of the proceeding:
         13.6.3.1. General information to educate or inform the public concerning military law and the
         military justice system;
         13.6.3.2. If the accused is a fugitive, information necessary to aid in apprehending the accused or
         to warn the public of possible dangers;
         13.6.3.3. Requests for assistance in obtaining evidence and information necessary to obtain evi-
         dence;
         13.6.3.4. Facts and circumstances of an accused’s apprehension, including the time and place of
         apprehension;
         13.6.3.5. The identities of investigating and apprehending agencies, and the length of the investi-
         gation, only if release of this information will not impede an ongoing or future investigation, and
         the release is coordinated with the affected agencies;
         13.6.3.6. Information contained in a public record, without further comment; and
         13.6.3.7. Information that protects the Air Force or the military justice system from the substan-
         tial, undue prejudicial effect of recent publicity initiated by some person or entity other than the
         Air Force. Information in the form of extrajudicial statements shall be limited to that which is nec-
         essary to correct misinformation or to mitigate substantial undue prejudicial information already
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                      245


       available to the public. This can include, but is not limited to, information that would have been
       available to a spectator at an open Article 32 investigation or an open session of a court-martial.
       Unless The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) has withheld the authority to coordinate on com-
       mand release of this information for individual cases or types of cases, the MAJCOM SJA (or
       equivalent) shall coordinate on release of this information by the appropriate command authority.
       If TJAG has withheld the authority to coordinate on release of extrajudicial statements, requests
       for TJAG coordination shall be forwarded through the MAJCOM SJA to AFLOA/JAJM by the
       most expeditious means appropriate for the sensitivity of the information.
   13.6.4. Extrajudicial Statements That Generally May Be Made Only After Preferral of
   Charges. Subject to the limitations in paragraphs 13.5.1. and 13.5.2., the following information may
   be provided after preferral of charges:
       13.6.4.1. The accused’s name, unit and assignment;
       13.6.4.2. The substance or text of charges and specifications, provided there is a statement
       included explaining that the charges are merely accusations and that the accused is presumed inno-
       cent until and unless proven guilty. As necessary, redact all Victim and Witness Protection Act and
       Privacy Act protected data from the charges and specifications.
       13.6.4.3. The scheduling or result of any stage in the judicial process;
       13.6.4.4. Date and place of trial and other proceedings, or anticipated dates, if known;
       13.6.4.5. Identity and qualifications of appointed counsel;
       13.6.4.6. Identities of convening and reviewing authorities;
       13.6.4.7. A statement, without comment, that the accused has no prior criminal or disciplinary
       record or that the accused denies the charges; and
       13.6.4.8. The identity of the victim where the release of that information is not otherwise prohib-
       ited by law. Generally, however, seek to avoid release of the name of victims of sex offenses, the
       names of children or the identity of any victim when release would be contrary to the desire of the
       victim or harmful to the victim.
       13.6.4.9. The identities of court members and the military judge. Do not volunteer the identities
       of the court members or the military judge in material prepared for publication. This information
       may be released, if requested, after the court members or the military judge have been identified in
       the court-martial proceeding and the SJA to the convening authority determines release would not
       prejudice the accused’s rights or violate the member’s or the military judge’s privacy interests.

13.7. Documentation Pertaining to Criminal Proceedings. This subsection applies to those docu-
ments and agency records created during the course of the military justice process and any document or
record incorporated into a military justice document or record. Unless AFLOA/JAJM or higher authority
withholds authority, the disclosure authority is the SJA for the convening authority responsible for the
criminal proceeding. File a copy of letters releasing documents or records with the allied papers and
immediately notify AFLOA/JAJM of any release. However, once a completed record is forwarded,
AFLOA/JAJM is the disclosure authority for all records and associated documents. This subsection does
not apply to documents or records that originate outside the military justice system of records (e.g., OSI
reports). The disclosure authority for those documents and records is the OPR for those records under the
246                                                           AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


provisions of the, AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, and/or the DODR 5400.7-AFSUP, DoD Freedom of
Information Act Program.
      13.7.1. Release of Court-Martial Record of Trial. RCM 1103(b)(2) defines a court-martial record
      of trial. The court-martial record of trial is subject to release determination under the Privacy Act and
      Freedom of Information Act. Information marked as classified, controlled, or sealed by judicial order
      should not be released absent an authoritative determination of releasability. A transcript of oral pro-
      ceedings is not a record until authentication. When releasing records of trial under this paragraph,
      redact all Victim and Witness Protection Act and Privacy Act protected data, to include the names of
      victims of sex offenses, the names of children, and the identity of victims who could be harmed by
      disclosure of their identity.
      13.7.2. Release of Other Military Justice Documents or Records. All other documents or records,
      including documents which will become part of a record of trial, and including those which are
      attached to the court-martial record of trial but not made a part of the record of trial under the provi-
      sions of RCM 1103 (for example, an Article 32 report and its attachments) are also subject to release
      determination under the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act. However, due regard will be
      given to the potentially heightened privacy interests of an accused where a case has not been fully
      adjudicated as well as to whether any exemption, such as those included to protect ongoing delibera-
      tive processes or investigative processes should be invoked. Information marked as classified, con-
      trolled, or sealed by judicial order should not be released absent an authoritative determination of
      releasability. When releasing military justice documents or records under this paragraph, redact all
      Victim and Witness Protection Act and Privacy Act protected data, to include the names of victims of
      sex offenses, the names of children, and the identity of victims who could be harmed by disclosure of
      their identity.
      13.7.3. Cases Disposed of by Acquittal or Action Other Than Court-Martial. When the charges
      against an accused were disposed of by an action other than court-martial, or when a court-martial
      results in an acquittal, due consideration must be given to the likelihood that the accused may have
      increased privacy interests in the protection of information contained in military justice documents or
      records. Less serious misconduct, which is handled administratively rather than judicially, generally is
      not considered of sufficient public interest to outweigh the privacy interest of the individual.

Section 13E—Special Interest Reports (SIRs)

13.8. Reporting Special Interest Cases to HQ USAF. Certain offenses committed by Air Force mem-
bers generate requests for information within HQ USAF, regardless of the member's grade. Similarly, an
accused's grade itself may generate requests for information, or necessitate HQ USAF knowledge of an
alleged offense. Staff judge advocates must be sensitive to reporting requirements in this chapter, and
make complete and timely reports. Reports should be prepared and forwarded by the base legal office
prosecuting the case or, if the case is in a civilian court, the base legal office servicing the unit where the
accused is assigned. None of the reporting requirements are intended to preclude a commander's complete
evaluation of a case before deciding what action, if any, to take.
      13.8.1. Officer, Cadet, CMSgt and SMSgt Cases. Regardless of offense, report all investigations
      into allegations involving officers, cadets, CMSgts, and SMSgts.
      13.8.2. Serious Crimes. Regardless of grade, report cases involving the following crimes, including
      attempts, conspiracies, and solicitations to commit these crimes:
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                        247


     13.8.2.1. homicide;
     13.8.2.2. rape and forcible sodomy;
     13.8.2.3. espionage, subversion, aiding the enemy, sabotage, spying, or violations of punitive reg-
     ulations or statutes regarding the handling of classified information or the foreign relations of the
     United States;
     13.8.2.4. environmental crimes, including civilian felony prosecution;
     13.8.2.5. sexual assault in a deployed environment;
     13.8.2.6. fraternization and unprofessional relationships; and
     13.8.2.7. anthrax or smallpox refusals.
     13.8.2.8. (Added-AMC) Crimes of a sexual nature not listed elsewhere (e.g., sexual assault, child
     sexual abuse, indecent acts, child pornography, or other sexual crimes), regardless of the charged
     offenses, including civilian felony prosecution.
  13.8.3. Cases with Media Interest. Report any other case with potential community reaction, or
  potential or actual media coverage.
  13.8.4. Report Format. Use the Automated Military Justice Analysis and Management System
  (AMJAMS) to generate reports. Ensure the initial report includes a detailed summary of the case by
  filling in all AMJAMS data fields. Include a thorough description of offenses, dates, UCMJ articles
  allegedly violated, the number of specifications under each offense, sufficient detail to provide senior
  leadership with a clear understanding of the facts and circumstances involved, whether media atten-
  tion is anticipated, and any other unusual or significant features of the case. Identify incomplete facts
  in the report and follow-up as soon as possible.
  13.8.5. When to Report. Submit reports:
     13.8.5.1. Immediately after learning of an incident in any of the above-mentioned categories;
     13.8.5.2. When a significant event in a reported case occurs after initial reporting. Significant
     events include disposition of investigation, preferral of charges, trial, results of trial, date Article
     15 offered, date Article 15 punishment imposed, and media interest;
     13.8.5.3. By the last duty day of each month to ensure reports are updated.
  13.8.6. At completion of the trial, send a facsimile copy of the AF Form 1359, Report of Result of
  Trial, to AFLOA/JAJM.
  13.8.7. AMJAMS Process. All special interest reporting should be accomplished via AMJAMS
  using the reports located on the AMJAMS reports page. Reporting special interest cases is a base
  responsibility. Updates should be made after every significant event until final disposition (e.g., Arti-
  cle 15, administrative action, preferral, Article 32, referral).
     13.8.7.1. SAF and NAF/MAJCOM SIR buttons are located in the Special Interest Folder of
     AMJAMS. Click the “SI reporting required” button for all cases listed in the paragraphs 13.8.1. to
     13.8.3. The “NAF/MAJCOM SIR” button is selected when a NAF/MAJCOM requires additional
     reporting not required by this AFI and the information is for use by each individual NAF and
     MAJCOM. If the case is disposed of via nonjudicial punishment, deselect the “SAF SI” box in
     AMJAMS. Deselect the “SAF SI” box after sentence is announced in courts-martial.

         13.8.7.2. Transmitting SIRs to AFLOA/JAJM. In addition to the requirement in paragraph
         13.8.5., updates are made on AMJAMS by going to the AMJAMS Reports page on the web and
         selecting SAF Report. Next, put in the date range and run the report. Select “[File/Send to/Page by
         Email]” to send the report to AFLOA/JAJM.
         13.8.7.3. (Added-AMC) AMJAMS Process. 18 AF/JA provides the report to AMC/CC through
         HQ AMC/JA.

Section 13F—Reporting Referral of Additional Charges in Cases Pending Review

13.9. Reporting Referral of Additional Charges in Cases Pending Review. I f a c a s e i s p e n d i n g
review under Articles 66, 67 or 69, UCMJ, the headquarters referring new charges must notify AFLOA/
JAJM of the facts relating to the new charges.

Section 13G—Reporting Foreign National USAF Member Cases

13.10. A foreign national USAF member is a member of the USAF who is a national of a foreign country
and who is not a citizen or national of the United States. For purposes of this section, any USAF member
who claims to be a foreign national shall be considered so.
      13.10.1. Notification. Notify HQ USAF/JAO when a foreign national USAF member is:
         13.10.1.1. Apprehended under circumstances likely to result in confinement or trial by court-mar-
         tial and states that he/she is a foreign national;
         13.10.1.2. Ordered into arrest or confinement;
         13.10.1.3. Held for trial with or without any form of restraint; or
         13.10.1.4. Pending court-martial charges which have been referred for trial.
      13.10.2. The notification shall include:
         13.10.2.1. The name, grade, SSN, organization and station of the foreign national USAF member;
         13.10.2.2. Any evidence, including information from the member’s military record, which is
         inconsistent with a claim of foreign nationality;
         13.10.2.3. A thorough description of offenses, including dates, UCMJ articles allegedly violated,
         the number of specifications under each offense, and sufficient detail to provide clear understand-
         ing of the facts and circumstances involved, and any other unusual or significant features of the
         case;
         13.10.2.4. The name of the military and/or civilian defense counsel, if any; and
         13.10.2.5. The exact location of the foreign national USAF member (e.g., Andrews AFB confine-
         ment facility).
      13.10.3. Whenever charges against a foreign national USAF member are referred for trial, the SJA of
      the SPCMCA shall have the member’s military records examined to ascertain the member’s national-
      ity even if that member has not entered a claim of foreign nationality.
      13.10.4. Notification is not required:
         13.10.4.1. When disciplinary action under Article 15, UCMJ, or administrative action is taken; or

      13.10.4.2. If the foreign national USAF member is apprehended or confined in anticipation that
      only such actions will be taken.
   13.10.5. The section does not apply when a foreign national is charged with a crime, arrested, con-
   fined or detained in custody by the civil authorities of the United States, or any political subdivision,
   possession or territory thereof, or by the authorities of any foreign government. AFJI 51-707, Consu-
   lar Protection of Foreign National Subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Section 13H—Time Management Of Case Processing

13.11. Time For Processing Cases.
   13.11.1. In General. SJAs must give managerial attention to all time standards prescribed by the
   MCM, statutes, case law and regulations.
   13.11.2. Coordination with AFOSI. SJAs should develop local procedures with their servicing
   AFOSI detachment commander to coordinate with agents as early as possible in the investigative
   stages of a case to ensure limited investigative resources are focused on gathering relevant evidence in
   a timely manner.
   13.11.3. Time Management. Expeditious processing of courts-martial is essential to minimize dis-
   ruptions in the Air Force mission, the lives of victims, witnesses, and the accused, and to minimize Air
   Force costs. The impartial and timely administration of military justice helps sustain good order and
   discipline. SJAs and chiefs of military justice, at all levels of command, should regularly analyze
   available AMJAMS data relating to each segment of court processing over which they have signifi-
   cant control to determine specific areas for improvement and implement appropriate management
   measures to maximize effectiveness and efficiency. The following Air Force court-martial metrics are
   established to assist in expediting the administration of justice.
      13.11.3.1. Convene 80% of all courts-martial (arraignment) on a Negotiated Trial Date within 45
      days after the accused is served (RCM 602).

      160 days.
      13.11.3.3. Complete 80% of all special courts-martial (Preferral Date - CA Action Date) within
      75 days.
      13.11.3.4. Complete 80% of all summary courts-martial (Preferral Date - CA Action Date) within

      13.11.3.7. Staff Judge Advocates are expected to ensure expeditious processing of cases by
      closely monitoring the time from the Case Ready Date until preferral of charges. Additionally,
      SJAs are to maintain statistics reflecting the time periods from the Case Ready Date to preferral.

Section 13I—Specific Search, Seizure, and Apprehension Matters
250                                                         AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


13.12. Authorization to Administer Oaths for Search, Seizure, and Apprehension. Air Force com-
manders and military magistrates are authorized to administer oaths or affirmations for purposes of autho-
rizing searches, seizures, and apprehensions based upon probable cause. Use the AF Form 3226,
Authority to Apprehend in Private Dwelling, to document authorization to apprehend someone from a pri-
vate dwelling. When required by the circumstances of a particular case, oral authorization may be given.

13.13. U.S. Mail. Refer to DoD 4525.6-M, Department of Defense Postal Manual, paragraph C10.7, for
procedures for the inspection, search, and seizure of mail in the custody of the military postal service. The
U.S. Postal Service operates post offices on CONUS installations and opening of mail is allowed only
pursuant to a valid search warrant executed by a federal magistrate or judge.

13.14. Military Defense Counsel . If a search authorization is to be issued against an ADC or SDC, or
his/her house or office, precautions must be taken to protect the confidentiality of attorney-client materi-
als to the maximum extent possible. Staff judge advocates will inform the commander, Air Force Legal
Operations Agency (AFLOA/CC), or the Director, USAF Judiciary (AFLOA/JAJ), before such search
authorizations are executed or as soon as practicable if exigent circumstances exist. United States v. Cal-
houn, 49 M.J. 485 (1998). If a search authorization is not required due to exigent circumstances IAW
MRE 315(g), notify AFLOA/CC or AFLOA/JAJ of the search as soon as practicable. See TJAG Policy
Memorandum: Military Justice - 2.

Section 13J—Appointment of Judges to the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals

13.15. Appointing Judges to AFCCA. Pursuant to Article 66, UCMJ, TJAG appoints judge advocates
to the AFCCA. The appointment may be documented using an AF Form 516, Certificate for Appointment
of Appellate Judge.

Section 13K—Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration under Federal
Law.

13.16. General Provision. If the member has been convicted of a sexually violent offense or certain
offenses against a minor, the member is subject to sex offender registration under Federal law. See the
Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act (1994);
Megan’s Law (1996); the Final Guidelines for the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexu-
ally Violent Offender Registration Act and Megan’s Law (1998); Pam Lyncher Sex Offender Tracking and
Identification Act (1996); Jacob Wetterling Improvements Act (1997); Protection of Children from Sexual
Predators Act (1998); and, Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (2006). The Acts are available
at the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) web-site http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/smart/legisla-
tion.htm.

13.17. The Security Forces (SF) corrections officer, or designee at the facility in which the prisoner is
detained ensures compliance with federal/state laws. See AFI 31-205, The Air Force Corrections System.
This includes the corrections officer notifying appropriate state and local law enforcement officials and
state sex offender registration officials using the DD Form 2791, Notice of Release/Acknowledgement of
Convicted Sex Offender Registration Requirements. It also includes the corrections officer notifying the
member about his or her registration responsibilities and obtaining the member’s acknowledgment of
these responsibilities.
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                        251


13.18. Base-level SJA Responsibilities. If a member is convicted of an offense that triggers the registra-
tion requirement, indicate on the AF Form 1359, Report of Result of Trial, that compliance with this sec-
tion is required. Use the language “SEX OFFENDER NOTIFICATION REQUIRED” in the SENTENCE
block of AF Form 1359. A determination that a member committed a qualifying offense has important
consequences. Figure 13.4. is a guideline of offenses, but not all inclusive based upon individual state
requirements. When a question arises whether a conviction is for a qualifying offense, SJAs should seek
guidance from a superior command level legal office and/or state officials. Further questions about
whether an offense triggers registration requirements may be directed to AFLOA/JAJM.
   13.18.1. No Post-trial Confinement. When compliance with Section 13K is required, but confine-
   ment is not part of the adjudged punishment (or sufficient pretrial or illegal pretrial confinement credit
   completely offsets the term of confinement imposed at trial), the SJA will notify the appropriate cor-
   rections officer (or the Security Forces commander, if there is no corrections officer), in writing,
   within 24 hours of the member’s conviction. For purposes of this section, conviction includes
   announcement of the sentence. The corrections officer, or the Security Forces commander, as appro-
   priate, will ensure that the notifications required in paragraph 13.16. and AFI 31-205 are made.

Section 13L—Compliance with DNA Collection under Federal Law

13.19. General Provision. An accused convicted by a general or special court-martial of a “qualifying
military offense” are subject to the mandatory collection of a DNA sample pursuant to Section 5 of the
DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000. 10 U.S.C. § 1565.

13.20. Base Level SJA Responsibilities. If an accused is convicted of an offense that triggers the man-
datory DNA collection requirement, indicate on the AF Form 1359, Report of Result of Trial, that compli-
ance with this section is required. Use the language “DNA PROCESSING REQUIRED” in the
SENTENCE block of AF Form 1359. Base-level SJAs will brief their commanders about the new DNA
processing requirements. The SJA uses Figure 13.3. (Notification of DNA Processing Responsibilities)
when notifying and briefing immediate commanders about their responsibilities on individual cases. SJAs
must ensure promulgating orders prepared for individuals convicted of a “qualifying military offense”
contain the annotation “DNA Processing Required. 10 U.S.C. § 1565.” in 14-point boldface type on the
first page of the order. The annotation must be one line, centered, and one inch from the top of the page.
In a general court-martial, the SJA to the general court-martial convening authority may send the “Notifi-
cation of DNA Processing Responsibilities” to the immediate commander through a subordinate SJA. For
additional guidance addressing a “qualifying military offense,” as well as substantive and procedural
requirements under the Act, See 10 U.S.C. § 1565; Figure 13.2. (DNA Processing Required Qualifying
Military Offenses Under 10 U.S.C. § 1565); and Figure 13.3. (Notification of DNA Processing Respon-
sibilities).
   13.20.1. Distribution of Promulgating Orders. Ensure a copy of the initial promulgating order,
   annotated for DNA processing, is also distributed to the following:
       13.20.1.1. U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory, ATTN: CODIS Lab, 4553 N. 2nd Street,
       Forrest Park, GA 30297-5132.
       13.20.1.2. HQ AFSFC/SFC, 1517 Billy Mitchell Boulevard, Lackland AFB, TX 78236-0119
       (even if the member did not receive confinement or is no longer in confinement at the time of
       action).
252                                                          AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


         13.20.1.3. The corrections officer of the facility at which the member is in confinement (for cases
         in which the member is currently confined).
         13.20.1.4. The member’s immediate commander.
      13.20.2. Commander Notification. The SJA for the convening authority taking initial action on a
      general or special court-martial that includes a conviction of a “qualifying military offense” ensures
      the accused’s immediate commander is notified and briefed about DNA processing responsibilities if:
         13.20.2.1. The accused receives a sentence that did not include confinement;
         13.20.2.2. The accused is no longer in confinement when the convening authority takes initial
         action on the sentence; or
         13.20.2.3. The SJA receives notice from a DoD Correctional Facility that the accused was
         released from confinement before correctional personnel could collect a DNA sample.
      13.20.3. DNA Processing Responsibilities. The immediate commander, upon notification from the
      SJA of the need for DNA processing of an accused with a conviction of a “qualifying military
      offense,” should:
         13.20.3.1. Ensure a U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory (USACIL) collection kit is
         promptly obtained from HQ AFSFC/SFC, 1517 Billy Mitchell Boulevard, Lackland AFB, TX
         78236-0119 [DSN 945-5622 or (210) 925-5622] or the nearest Air Force Correctional Facility
         designated by HQ AFSFC/SFC to maintain such kits.
         13.20.3.2. Ensure a DNA sample is obtained using the DNA collection kit and instructions con-
         tained therein. The commander will utilize local Security Forces (SF) corrections personnel and
         local medical personnel, to the maximum extent possible, to process the collection of the DNA
         sample. This includes requesting local SF personnel assistance in completing items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
         and 8 on the USACIL collection card (which includes fingerprinting the accused and witnessing
         the drawing of blood) and mailing the sample to USACIL. This also includes using local medical
         personnel to collect the blood sample and complete any pertinent items on the USACIL collection
         card.
         13.20.3.3. Ensure the required DNA sample is collected and mailed to USACIL before the
         accused is permitted to begin excess appellate leave or before the accused is administratively dis-
         charged from the Air Force. If an accused departs on excess appellate leave before the DNA sam-
         ple is collected, the commander shall notify the accused of this requirement and request a
         voluntary return by the accused, at no expense to the government, and provide a sample while
         remaining in excess appellate leave status. If the accused is no longer in the immediate area, the
         commander may arrange for the DNA processing at a military installation closer to the accused’s
         appellate leave address. If the accused does not or is unable to voluntarily return at his or her own
         expense to comply with DNA processing mandated by law, the commander shall recall the mem-
         ber to duty for the purpose of obtaining the required DNA sample. Consult AFI 36-3003, Military
         Leave Program, paragraph 4.11.3, and the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR), paragraph
         U7220, for funding issues. If the accused is no longer in the immediate area when recalled, the
         commander may consider arranging for the accused to report for duty and provide a DNA sample
         at a military installation near his or her appellate leave address to minimize government expense.
         13.20.3.4. If an accused does not comply with a recall to duty from appellate leave status or oth-
         erwise refuses to cooperate in providing a DNA sample, contact the SJA for guidance. [Note:
AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008                                                                         253


       When these situations arise, the SJA should notify and consult with AFLOA/JAJM, Policy and
       Precedent Branch.]
       13.20.3.5. Notify the SJA and HQ AFSFC/SFC of the date the DNA sample was sent to USACIL.
       If a DNA sample cannot be obtained, the reason must be provided.
   13.20.4. Members Subject to Collection. DNA samples shall not be collected from members who
   are no longer subject to military jurisdiction. Accordingly, execution of a punitive or administrative
   discharge should be deferred until DNA processing has been completed.

Section 13M—Compliance with the Domestic Violence Amendment to the Gun Control Act of 1968
(known as “The Lautenberg Amendment”)

13.21. General Provision. The Lautenberg Amendment makes it a felony for any person to sell or other-
wise dispose of firearms or ammunition to any person whom he or she knows or has reasonable cause to
believe has been convicted of a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.” Additionally, persons con-
victed of such crimes are also prohibited from: (1) shipping or transporting in interstate commerce or for-
eign commerce, (2) possessing in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition, or (3) receiving any
firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. A “crime
of domestic violence” is an offense that has as its factual basis one of the following: (1) the use or
attempted use of physical force, or (2) the threatened use of a deadly weapon. One of the factors must be
coupled with a crime committed by a current or former spouse, parent or guardian of the victim; by a per-
son with whom the victim shares a child in common; by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabi-
tated with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian; or, by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent
or guardian of the victims. Qualifying convictions include “a crime of domestic violence” tried by general
or special court-martial which otherwise meets the elements of a crime of domestic violence even though
not classified as a misdemeanor or felony. 18 U.S.C. § 922(d) and (g).

13.22. Base Level SJA Responsibilities. If an accused is convicted at a special or general court-martial
of an offense constituting “a crime of domestic violence,” indicate this on the AF Form 1359. Place the
language “CRIME OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE” in the SENTENCE block of the AF Form 1359. SJAs
must also ensure promulgating orders prepared for individuals convicted of a qualifying offense contain
the annotation “Crime of Domestic Violence. 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).” The annotation must be one line,
centered, in 14-point boldface type, and one inch from the top of the page. SJAs are responsible for
informing commanders of the impact of the conviction on the accused’s ability to handle firearms or
ammunition as part of their official duties; briefing commanders on retrieving all Government-issued fire-
arms and ammunition and suspending the member’s authority to possess Government-issued firearms and
ammunition; and advising members of their commands to lawfully dispose of their privately owned fire-
arms and ammunition. For additional guidance addressing qualifying offenses, as well as substantive and
procedural requirements under the Act, See 18 U.S.C. §§ 921 and 922.

FROM: (JA Office)


SUBJECT: Notification of DNA Processing Responsibilities


1. In accordance with Section 5 of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000, 10 U.S.C. § 1565,
a DNA sample must be collected from each member of the armed forces who has been convicted of cer-
tain “qualifying military offenses.” (Rank/Full Name of Member), a member of your unit, was convicted
of (identify offense, e.g., rape), which is a “qualifying military offense.” Normally, correctional personnel
accomplish DNA processing while the member is serving a sentence of confinement. Because (the mem-
ber in this case did not receive confinement as part of the sentence)(a DNA sample was not obtained by
correctional personnel prior to this member’s release from confinement), it becomes a command respon-
sibility to ensure compliance with the law.


2. As this member’s immediate commander, you should:


       a. Obtain a DNA collection kit from [The Air Force Correctional Facility at __________
       AFB, a facility designated by AFSFC/SFC to maintain such kits, by calling HQ AFSFC/
       SFC, DSN 945-5622 or (210) 925-5622.]


        b. Ensure a DNA sample is obtained using the DNA collection kit and instructions contained
therein. Utilize local Security Forces (SF) corrections personnel and local medical personnel, to the max-
imum extent possible, to process the collection of the DNA sample. This includes requesting local SF per-
sonnel assistance in completing pertinent items on the U.S. Army Criminal Investigative Laboratory
(USACIL) collection card (which includes fingerprinting the member and witnessing the drawing of
blood) and mailing the sample to the USACIL. This also includes using local medical personnel to collect
the blood sample and complete pertinent portions of the USACIL collection card.


        c. Ensure the required DNA sample is collected and mailed to USACIL before the member is per-
mitted to begin excess appellate leave or before the member is administratively discharged from the Air
Force. If a member went on excess appellate leave before the DNA sample was collected, you should
notify the member of this requirement and request that the member voluntarily return, at no expense to the
government, and provide a sample while remaining in excess appellate leave status. If the member is no
258                                                        AFI51-201_AMCSUP_I 15 AUGUST 2008


longer in the immediate area, you may arrange for the DNA processing at a military installation closer to
the member’s appellate leave address. If the member does not or is unable to voluntarily return at his or
her own expense to comply with DNA processing mandated by law, you should recall the member to duty
for the purpose of obtaining the required DNA sample. For funding issues, consult AFI 36-3003, Military
Leave Program, paragraph 4.11.3, and the Joint Federal Travel Regulation, paragraph U7220. If the mem-
ber is no longer in the immediate area, you may consider arranging for the member to report for duty and
provide a DNA sample at a military installation near his or her appellate leave address to minimize gov-
ernment expense. If a member does not comply with a recall to duty from appellate leave status or other-
wise refuses to cooperate in providing a DNA sample, contact my office for guidance.


        d. Notify my office of the date the DNA sample for the above member was sent to USACIL by
completing the indorsement below. If a DNA sample cannot be obtained, state the reason in the indorse-
ment (i.e., member discharged from active duty on ).


       e. If more than 90 days is required to obtain the sample, please advise.


3. If you have any questions regarding the foregoing, contact (Grade and Name) at
(XXX) XXX-XXXX (Commercial) or DSN XXX-XXXX.
