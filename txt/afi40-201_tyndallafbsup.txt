Air Force Instruction (AFI) 40-201, 16 March 2011, is supplemented as follows. This
instruction supplements AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force. It
applies to 325 FW employees, contractors, Host Tenant Units, and Geographically Separated
Units and activities that acquire, receive, store, distribute, or use radioactive mat erials or
radiation producing devices. Refer recommended changes regarding this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR), 325 AMDS/SGPB, using AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication. Ensure accordance with Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposal of Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS): https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been revised and requires a complete review of all subject matter.


2. 16. 21. (Added) Establishes investigation levels to ensure exposure to personnel is
maintained as- low-as-reasonably achievable (ALARA). Investigational levels should be
developed for each occupational group and are intended to identify adverse trends, assess their
causes, and implement appropriate corrective actions.

            2.16.21.1. (Added) Occupational Groups monitored with on the Tyndall Air Force
            Base Dosimetry program are Diagnostic Imaging (4RO), Veterinarian (91A/64T),
            325 SFS Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System Operations (3P0), and Air Force
            Research Laboratory Development Engineer (62E).
            2.16.21.2. (Added) The Occupational Groups in para 2.16.21.1. will be assessed in
            accordance with requirements listed in paragraph 2.16.9, AFI 48-148, and AFMAN
            48-125.
            2.16.21.3. (Added) Investigation Action Levels are listed in Table 1, Investigation
            Action Levels. Investigation Action Levels for pregnant females monitored monthly
            with dosimetry are 5 millirem/month whole body. The values in the table are based
            on historical workplace trends. Actual trends show zero dose for most Occupational
            Groups monitored with dosimetry; any value above zero will trigger an investigation.

          2.21.2.1. (Added) Receipt. Procedures must include contacting Bioenvironmental
          Engineering (BE) immediately upon notification that radioactive material has arrived
          on base. BE will survey (within 3 hours of receipt during duty hours) any package
          labeled with a radioactive White I, Yellow II, or Yellow III label to verify the
          package does not have removable radioactive contamination or radiation intensity
          above the package limits. Contact BE at 283-7139 during duty hours. Priority 999
          packages will be surveyed after normal duty hours by contacting a BE representative
          through the Command Post at 283-2854.
          2.21.2.2. (Added) If personnel from either a receiving or using organization notes

          meeting the education or experience requirements of AFI 40-201, permittee,
          commander, or equivalent will provide resources to ensure designated RSO/alternates
          are appropriately trained.
          2.25.11.4. (Added) Ensure that the unit specific operating instruction is updated or

       2.28.25. (Added) Receipt and Shipment. Contact Installation RSO immediately upon
       notification that radioactive material has arrived on base. Monitoring must be performed
       within 3 hours of arrival. Coordinate with the Installation RSO prior to any transfer,
       disposal, or turn- ins. Written confirmation of receipt must be provided when receiving
       permitted materials from another Air Force organization and authority to receive

       Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Form 3, Notice to Employees; Notice of
       Availability of License, Regulations and Procedures and radiation area caution and
       warning signs are properly posted in the area where the permitted radioactive material
