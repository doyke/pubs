   2.2. Invigorate FWA prevention efforts at all levels in the wing.
   2.3. Leverage all installation agency resources to identify, report, and correct FWA issues.
   2.4. Educate all assigned personnel on what constitutes FWA and how to report it.

       3.1.2. Conduct the program in accordance with AFI 90-301 and other HHQ guidance.
       3.1.3. Create and chair the 28 BW FWA Prevention Working Group.
       3.1.4. FWA prevention information and reporting guidance will be part of every IG brief.
    3.2. FWA Prevention Working Group.
       3.2.1. The working group will consist of various representatives from across the
       installation as directed by the IG but should include JA, SFS, CPTS, CONS, AFSO 21,
       IDEA, AFOSI, AFAA, and Civilian Personnel.
       3.2.2. Meet at least quarterly to discuss FWA cross tell, prevention ideas, cases, lessons

       3.2.3. Report quarterly to the 28 BW/CC significant issues and/or trends.

       3.3.1. Using AFI 90-301 guidance and the ACC IG Guide to FWA Awareness establish a

       deficiencies, minimize waste, emphasize economy, and identify/correct potential FWA.
       3.3.2. Designate FWA Program Monitors at appropriate levels.
       3.3.3. Report all FWA allegations/investigations to the IG. This is not intended to hand

       issues to the commander.
