                               GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Overview. The Buckley AFB Weather Station is located in Hangar 909. The weather
station is operated by contractors and is also referred to as the Buckley AFB Base Weather
Station (BWS). Weather observation functions are a 24-hour continuous operation; forecasting
is not accomplished by the BWS. The weather contractor is responsible for compliance with all
Air Force regulations and supplemental directives to accomplish the mission. Additionally, the
BWS provides or arranges for observation support to BAFB host and tenant units. Units and
aircrews requiring weather forecasting services must contact the 25th Operational Weather
Squadron (OWS) at Davis Monthan AFB, Commercial (520) 228-6598/6599 or Defense
Switched Network (DSN) 228-6598/6599.

                                            Chapter 2

                             WEATHER STATION OPERATIONS

2.1. Operating Hours. The BWS provides continuous 24-hour observation services in
accordance with published Air Force (AF) and higher headquarters directives. Hourly, special,
and local surface weather observations are taken and disseminated under the Basic Weather
Watch (BWW)/Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW) concepts IAW current Air Force directives,
to include all published landing minimums found in Flight Information Publications (FLIP)
applicable to BAFB (see Attachments 2 and 3 for special and local observation criteria.) All
observations will be transmitted to using agencies via current weather system. Staff, liaison,
climatic, and technical support are also available during normal duty hours or as previously
coordinated.
2.2. Duty Priorities. Weather station duty priorities are listed below. Requests for changes to
these duty priorities must be submitted to and approved by the BWS Supervisor.
     2.2.1. During hours when the airfield is OPEN and CLOSED (24/7 coverage):
        2.2.1.1. Complete Emergency War Orders Tasking.
        2.2.1.2. Respond to aircraft/ground emergencies.
        2.2.1.3. Take and disseminate surface observations.
        2.2.1.4. Answer Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV) calls.
        2.2.1.5. Disseminate observed advisories (e.g., Ice FOD).
        2.2.1.6. Disseminate Pilot Reports (PIREP).
2.3. Release of Weather Information. Operations security and communications security will
be considered prior to any release of weather information. Specific restrictions do not exist on
the dissemination of weather information to other military agencies. Information exchange
between BWS and the local National Weather Service (NWS) office is encouraged in the interest
of public safety and resource protection. Routine working agreements will be maintained in
writing from either agency. Support to other non-military agencies, foreign governments or
individuals will be coordinated with the 460th Space Wing Staff Judge Advocate (460 SW/JA)
before service or information can be provided. The host-wing public affairs office will approve
all direct media requests for weather information. This restriction does not include indirect
routine weather information that is passed on automated weather circuits or information passed
through the NWS in the interest of public safety.
2.4. Observing Limitations. The following limitations may preclude the accurate observing of
some weather phenomena:
     2.4.1. The official point of observation is approximately 35 feet from the southeast corner of
     Hangar 909. The visibility from this point is partially restricted by buildings from 240-320
     degrees, and terrain somewhat blocks the view of the airfield from 320-135 degrees. The
     observer must walk to the west and north to adequately see the entire horizon.
2.5. Alternate Operating Location for Weather Support. Observation services will relocate
to an alternate site in the event of an emergency that could impact Hangar 909. In accordance
BUCKLEYAFBI15-101 3 APRIL 2014                                                                   7


with (IAW) AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and
Operations, the duty observer will not relocate for exercises unless qualified personnel are
available to augment the weather station during their absence. The primary back-up weather
station is the BAFB Air Traffic Control (ATC) Tower. Access to a Class A telephone and the
catwalk is required. If available, a back-up radio will be set to 228.45 Megahertz (MHz) for
PMSV support. When evacuated, the observer on duty will notify the 140th Wing Command
Post (140 WG/CP) and the 460th Space Wing Command Post (460 SW/CP) that weather is
relocating and to telephone patch PMSV contacts to the alternate location. The BWS will also
notify the 25 OWS when evacuating to the alternate facility. Alternate observer kits are kept in
the BWS and available for immediate relocation.
   2.5.1. Observing Services. Limited weather observations will be taken from the alternate
   site and provided to the air traffic controller. These observations will include sky condition,
   visibility, winds, altimeter setting, pressure altitude, temperature, dew point, and weather and
   obstructions to vision.
2.6. Severe Weather Management. The duty observer will contact the BWS Supervisor and
the 25th OWS duty forecaster whenever the potential exists for severe weather at BAFB. This
severe weather support will be limited to mission-essential requirements to ensure critical
weather information is relayed in a timely manner.
2.7. Pilot Reports (PIREP). A prime source of current weather information is the pilot report.
Aircrews are highly encouraged to pass PIREPs to BWS personnel through squadron operations,
BAFB tower, or PMSV radio. PIREPs can and do provide the flying community with valuable
information from data-sparse areas. All PIREPs received will be disseminated over current
weather equipment if they meet the required criteria.
2.8. Oversight Responsibility. Weather services are a contracted function, and the 140th
Operations Support Squadron (140 OSS) is designated as the functional area chief (FAC). As
the FAC, the 140 OSS will monitor day-to-day operations of the BWS and act as the focal point
for all base agencies in matters relating to weather support issues/problems. The 140 OSS will
coordinate any weather support requirement changes with the Quality Assurance Evaluator
(QAE) from the Air National Guard Operations Weather Support Division (NGB/A3OS). The
140 OSS shall exercise operational, financial, and administrative oversight of the BWS.

                                WEATHER OBSERVING SERVICES

3.1. Official Observing Location. See paragraph 2.4.1. for the official observation point.
3.2. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). The observer performs a BWW from the weather station
IAW AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations. When significant changes in the weather
are expected or detected, the observer will evaluate the need to take special or local observations
IAW Air Force directives. This will be done at an interval not to exceed 20 minutes when the
ceiling or visibility is observed or forecast to increase to, exceed, or decrease to less than any of
the following:
     3.2.1. Ceiling 2,000 feet.
     3.2.2. Ceiling 1,500 feet.
     3.2.3. Ceiling 1,000 feet.
     3.2.4. Ceiling 200 feet.
     3.2.5. Visibility 3 miles.
     3.2.6. Visibility 2 miles.
     3.2.7. Visibility ½ mile.
     3.2.8. Precipitation (any form).
     3.2.9. Thunderstorm/lightning.
     3.2.10. Fog.
3.3. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). To augment the BWW, a CWW has been
established in which ATC personnel provide additional weather information to the observer
when significant weather phenomena are detected. Significant phenomena include, but not
limited to, tornadoes, funnel clouds, precipitation, lightning, and reduced visibility.
3.4. Surface Weather Observations. The duty weather observer takes, records, and
disseminates an official observation from the official observing location before every hour IAW
Air Force directives. All weather observations at BAFB are taken IAW instructions in AFMAN
15-111, Surface Weather Observations. The following are the elements observed by the BWS
observer and disseminated locally and longline, in the order they appear in the observation, for
use by various agencies using the current weather system.
     3.4.1. Time. All time entries on current weather systems will be in Coordinated Universal
     Time (UTC). Weather watches, warnings, and advisories will also have the corresponding
     LOCAL (L) times.
     3.4.2. Wind Speed and Direction. Wind direction is reported to the nearest 10 degrees and
     speed to the nearest whole knot. Wind direction is transmitted true for longline
     dissemination and magnetic for local dissemination.
     3.4.3. Prevailing Visibility. This is defined as the greatest visibility equaled or exceeded in
     at least half of the horizon circle not necessarily continuous. Prevailing visibility is a visual
BUCKLEYAFBI15-101 3 APRIL 2014                                                                  9


   determination made by the observer. When the visibility, either as seen by the observer or
   reported by ATC personnel is below 4 miles, the lowest visibility reported will be used for
   aircraft operations. Obstructions to vision will be determined by the observer and reported
   when the prevailing visibility is 6-statute miles or less, except in the case of precipitation,
   which is reported when it occurs. All visibilities are reported in statute miles.
   3.4.4. Runway Visual Range (RVR). The RVR is reported immediately following the
   prevailing visibility. RVR will be reported when the prevailing visibility is 1-statute mile or
   less, or when the RVR is 6,000 feet or less.
   3.4.5. Weather and Obstruction to Vision. This consists of both weather and non-weather
   phenomena, which are observed and/or restrict visibility. The table below identifies the more
   common phenomena and the observing code used:

   visually, using Doppler radar returns, upper air reports, mountainous terrain, and from
   aircraft flying in the local area.
   3.4.7. Temperature and Dew Point. Instantaneous readings of temperature and dew point are
   reported in degrees Celsius.
   3.4.8. Altimeter Setting. Altimeter setting values are determined using a digital barometer
   and transmitted on all observations, except for some single element observations (i.e.,
   tornadoes). Altimeter setting is reported to the nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury.
   3.4.9. Sea-Level Pressure (SLP). This is the atmospheric pressure at mean sea level
   empirically determined from the observed station pressure. SLP is reported in millibars.
   3.4.10. Remarks. Significant remarks will be disseminated on all observations to present a
   more precise picture of existing weather conditions.
3.5. Types of Observations. The duty observer makes the following types of observations:
Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR), Aviation Select Special Weather Report (SPECI),
and Local Surface Observation (LOCAL). Attachments 2 and 3 list the special and local
observation criteria respectively. All observations are sent to local base agencies using the
current weather system. All observations, except locals, are also sent into the Automated
Weather Network (AWN) for use by non-base agencies. In the event of weather system outage,
local dissemination will be by telephone and longline dissemination will be done via uploading
information into the Joint Air Force and Army Weather Information Network (JAAWIN), or by
an alternate weather unit.
   3.5.1. Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR). METAR observations are taken
   between 45-55 minutes past the hour and transmitted between 55-59 minutes past the hour,
   24-hours per day. Elements included in METAR observations are listed in paragraph 3.4.
   3.5.2. Aviation Select Special Weather Report (SPECI). SPECI observations are taken when
   the conditions for special criteria are met. The established criteria for special observations
   are listed in Attachment 2. Specials contain all elements included in a METAR observation,
   except for SLP. Single element specials may be made only when time is critical and
   encoding all elements would jeopardize life or property (for example tornadoes). These
   single element specials will contain only the time and the element, which required the
   observation.
   3.5.3. Local (LOCAL). LOCAL observations are taken when conditions for local criteria
   listed in Attachment 3 are met. LOCAL observations contain the same elements as a SPECI
   but are only transmitted locally. Single element LOCAL observations are taken for RVR and
   altimeter settings.
3.6. Observing Instrumentation. The BAFB runway has instruments at various locations on
the airfield. Readouts from this equipment are all located in the BWS. The weather sensors and
their approximate location on the airfield are depicted in Attachment 4.
3.7. Airburst Range (R2601, Range 123) Observations. Observations from Airburst Range
will periodically be taken via an AN/TMQ-53 Remote Weather Sensing System operated by
range personnel. When acquired and operational, this information will be relayed to the AWN
systematically as locally established SPECI criteria and hourly weather observation thresholds
are met. Operation of this system will be the exception rather than the rule until further notice.
BUCKLEYAFBI15-101 3 APRIL 2014                                                          11


When operating, information from this equipment will be used to generate Target Acquisition
Weather Software (TAWS) data for use by 120th Fighter Squadron (FS) personnel as needed.

                                FORECASTING SERVICES

4.1. General. Weather forecasting is accomplished by the 25th OWS. Forecast services consist
of local weather forecasts, flight weather briefings, staff briefings, and a meteorological watch
program (METWATCH). The 25 OWS also provides weather warnings, watches and advisories.
Chapter 5 covers the METWATCH program in more detail.
4.2. 25th Operational Weather Squadron (25 OWS) Home Page. The 25 OWS has a web
site (https://25ows.dm.af.mil) on the Internet dedicated to providing weather information for
BAFB. A wide variety of operationally significant weather information is also available from
this site.
BUCKLEYAFBI15-101 3 APRIL 2014                                                                 13


                                           Chapter 5

            THE METEOROLOGICAL WATCH (METWATCH) PROGRAM

5.1. General. METWATCH is the process of monitoring changing weather conditions and
informing supported agencies that established weather conditions could affect their operations or
pose a threat to property or life. Weather advisories, watches, and warnings are issued to provide
information to supported agencies to allow them to take appropriate actions.
5.2. Weather Advisories. A weather advisory is a special notice to supported agencies that
established weather conditions are occurring or are expected to occur. There are two types of
advisories, observed and forecast. Observed advisories are issued when the specified weather
condition is occurring and is canceled when the condition no longer exists. Forecast advisories
are issued when the established weather condition is expected to occur. These advisories are
canceled when the condition is no longer expected or if the advisory is superseded by a weather
warning. Weather advisories are issued by the 25 OWS; the BWS will also issue observed
advisories.
5.3. Weather Watches. A weather watch is an informational message to supported agencies
that conditions are favorable for the formation of threatening weather. Weather watches are
generally issued prior to weather warnings and are intended to provide advance notice of
potentially significant weather. Weather watches will be issued on the potential for the weather
condition to occur and will be canceled when the potential no longer exists, or when upgraded to
weather warnings when the potential is determined to be significant enough that protective
measures must be taken to protect property and life. Weather watches are issued by the 25th
OWS.
5.4. Weather Warnings. A weather warning is a special notice to supported agencies that
established weather conditions are occurring or are expected to occur. Weather warnings differ
from weather advisories in that the severity of the weather conditions is greater for weather
warnings. The 25 OWS will strive to provide at least the desired lead time (DLT) specified for
each criterion. However, the state of the science does not allow the provision of DLT in all
cases. The 25th OWS will provide valid times on all warnings. Weather warnings will be issued
when conditions are expected to occur and canceled when conditions are no longer expected to
occur. The 25 OWS will cancel all warnings, which are no longer required, prior to the end of
their valid times. When required, the 25 OWS forecaster will extend the valid times for
warnings prior to the end of their valid time, and amend a warning when any of the criteria or
valid times changes. If the amendment includes the addition of other warning criteria, the
forecaster will attempt to provide the appropriate lead-time for the new criteria. The BWS will
also issue observed warnings (e.g., lightning within 5 NM).

                                    BRIEFING SUPPORT

6.1. Flight Weather Briefings. The 25 OWS duty forecaster provides flight-weather briefings
to all assigned aircrews and to transient aircrews. Briefings will be documented using DD Form
175-1, Flight Weather Briefing, or an approved local/ MAJCOM substitute. To ensure adequate
preparation time, requests for flight weather briefings should be made to the 25th OWS a
minimum of two hours prior to estimated departure time.
6.2. Pilot to Metro Service (PMSV). The BWS operates a PMSV radio to provide updated
weather information to airborne aircrews and to receive PIREPs. The Ultra High Frequency
(UHF) channel 228.45 MHz is continually monitored by BWS. Aircrews should relay PIREPs
of weather conditions encountered during takeoff/climb-out, approach, landing, and on the
ranges/in the Military Operating Areas when practical. It is extremely critical for the safety of
other aircrews that all hazardous or unforecast flight weather conditions be promptly reported.
PIREPs can be passed directly to the BWS via the PMSV, to ATC personnel, or to the
Supervisor of Flying (SOF). The BWS will disseminate all PIREPs longline and will also
disseminate them locally when weather conditions in the terminal area are significantly different
from those briefed or previously forecast, or when the conditions could impact the safety of
flight operations. These conditions include, but are not limited to, low-level wind shear below
2,000 feet Above Ground Level (AGL), icing of any type or intensity, moderate or greater
turbulence, or any other significant weather phenomena reported.

                            SPECIAL TECHNICAL SERVICES

7.1. Hazardous Spills. In the event that toxic chemicals are released into the atmosphere on
BAFB, the BWS will relay current weather conditions upon request. The BWS may be tasked to
provide Chemical Downwind Messages (CDM) to support command and control or disaster
response personnel.
7.2. Climatological Data. Climatological information is available for most major airfield
locations around the world available at the BWS. This information is available for use for
operational planning purposes. Historical weather data is also available for BAFB. The BWS
will be the OPR for any climatological data requests to the Air Force Combat Climatology
Center (AFCCC). Urgency, complexity of the request, and workload dictate the required time to
acquire climatological data from AFCCC.
7.3. Nuclear Fallout Winds. In the event of a nuclear incident, the BWS will provide upper
level wind data to Readiness and Emergency Management personnel upon request.
7.4. Earthquake Reports. AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations, requires all USAF
weather units with observing and/or forecasting functions located in the United States to report
earthquake occurrences. Units that experience an earthquake will access the United States
Geological Survey website (http://earthquake.usgs.gov) and complete the required report as
soon as possible.

                      JOINT ENVIRONMENTAL TOOLKIT (JET)

8.1. JET Concept of Operations. The JET is designated as the single point from which
weather personnel disseminate weather products. It automates the way in which weather
products are prepared in support of customer missions. The JET System Manager (ASM) will be
designated by the BWS Manager to manage the system. JET problems are handled through the
BWS. JET hardware problems are handled through each agency’s Client Support Administrator
(CSA). In the event that the JET central processor in Hangar 909 becomes inoperative,
information will not be transmitted or received by JET computers. Telephone or internet backup
systems will be used.
8.2. JET Local Training Process. Training for all JET users can be found on the JET website
once a user has access to the account. Account creation will be provided by the ASM.
8.3. JET Operational Responsibilities.
   8.3.1. BWS. Weather personnel will provide weather products through JET as contained in
   this publication. The ASM is responsible for overall system management and will be the JET
   focal point for all agencies using JET, to include interaction and outage reporting.
   8.3.2. JET Users. Units will notify the base weather station personnel in case of non-receipt
   of scheduled weather or of any JET outages. During JET outages, BWS personnel will pass
   watches, warnings, and advisories via telephone to the 460 SW/CP, 140 WG/CP, Tower and
   Airfield Operations. To avoid unnecessary delays in relaying critical weather information to
   aircrews, air traffic control, and command authorities, units using JET should use the
   information provided and refrain from routinely contacting the weather station.
   8.3.3. Non-JET Users. Due to flight safety concerns, individual organizations that do not
   have a JET terminal should refrain from contacting the BWS station directly. This can cause
   delays in relaying information to aircrew, air traffic control agencies, and command
   authorities. Any unit with concerns regarding delays in receiving information should route
   concerns to NGB/XOOSW (QAE).

                                 RECIPROCAL SUPPORT

9.1. General. Mutual support and cooperation are key elements in the BWS’s ability to provide
complete and timely weather support to customers. This section outlines reciprocal support for
base agencies and individual unit responsibilities.
   9.1.1. Each supported unit must inform the BWS supervisor in writing of any permanent
   changes in weather support requirements. One time or temporary changes may be
   coordinated by telephone with the BWS supervisor. In addition, each unit with current
   weather system equipment must notify the BWS of all current weather system outages and
   when the equipment is again operational.
9.2. 460th Space Wing Command Post (460 SW/CP).
   9.2.1. Notify the BWS of any accident, mishap, or event in which weather or weather service
   may be involved by notifying the on-duty observer.
   9.2.2. Disseminate all weather warnings, watches, and advisories to 460 SW units and those
   included IAW established command post checklists and directives.
   9.2.3. Notify the BWS of any changes in weather support requirements.
9.3. 120th Fighter Squadron Commander (120 FS/CC).
   9.3.1. Pass all significant PIREPs to the BWS through PMSV or ATC.
9.4. 140th Mission Support Group Commander (140 MSG/CC) and 460th Mission Support
Group Commander (460 MSG/CC):
   9.4.1. The 140 MSG/CC has the primary responsibility to ensure adequate facilities are
   provided to operate and conduct all required weather functions and such facilities are
   maintained at desired standards. If the 140 MSG/CC is unable to provide this support,
   assistance may be requested from the 460 MSG/CC.
   9.4.2. Notify NGB/XOOSW (QAE) and the BWS Supervisor of Operational Reports
   (OPREP)-3 reports involving the base weather contractor’s personnel, resources, or weather
   related incidents.
   9.4.3. Notify NGB/XOOSW (QAE) and the BWS Supervisor of crimes or serious incidents
   involving the base weather contractor service operations, personnel, or property.
   9.4.4. Notify NGB/XOOSW (QAE) and the BWS Supervisor of any base damage (including
   the Aerospace Data Facility-Colorado (ADF-C)/460 OG compound) caused by weather or
   any accident or incident involving base weather services or resources.
9.5. 460th Space Communications Squadron (460 SCS).
   9.5.1. Program and budget for, install and provide routine maintenance on equipment
   approved by the 460 SCS that will be added to the Buckley AFB network.
       9.5.1.1. BWS personnel must meet all 460 SW Information Assurance and Information
       Protection criteria prior to operating 460 SW information technology assets.

Basic Weather Watch (BWW)— A Basic Weather Watch involves limited versus continuous
weather observing. The BWW requires observing and reporting of weather conditions at BAFB
on an hourly basis, when no local or special weather criteria is occurring. As a minimum, checks
are performed every 20 minutes to see if any local or special observing criteria thresholds have
been crossed, which would require dissemination of the appropriate update.
Base Weather Station (BWS)— The BWS is a contracted function and is operated by Control
Systems Research Inc. The unit designation is 140 OSS/OSW.
Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW)— A CWW is established between ATC and BWS. The
occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions which could affect flight safety, or
which could be critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations and resources is of
primary concern.
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)— An atomic time scale that is the basis for broadcast time
signals. In practice, it is the universally accepted time of reference.
Desired Lead-Time (DLT)— The amount of advance notice a supported agency requires to
complete necessary actions prior to the onset of an established weather event.
Distant (DSNT)— Used to identify weather phenomena beyond 10-statute miles.
BUCKLEYAFBI15-101 3 APRIL 2014                                                                      25


Joint Air Force and Army Weather Information Network (JAAWIN)— A military Internet
weather information system that constantly provides worldwide observed and forecasted data to
help aircrews and military forecasters. This network is run by the Air Force Weather Agency at
Offutt AFB, NE.
Meteorological Watch (METWATCH)— The process of actively comparing observed weather
conditions with those forecasted and updating forecasts with the latest information.
Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET)— A computer-communication database system consisting
of a computer in the BAFB weather station that disseminates weather data via the LAN to
selected users on BAFB.
Pilot Report (PIREP)— A report of observed flight weather conditions usually passed to
weather personnel through the PMSV radio.
Pilot—to-Metro Service (PMSV) – An Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radio service (228.45
MHz) that allows aircrews to contact weather personnel for updated weather conditions and to
pass on significant flight weather reports.
Sea—Level Pressure (SLP) – This is the atmospheric pressure at mean sea level empirically
determined from the observed station pressure. SLP is reported in millibars.
Severe (SVR) Thunderstorm— A thunderstorm capable of producing winds 50 knots or greater
and/or hail 3/4 inches in diameter or greater.
Severe Weather— Established weather conditions that are deemed to pose a hazard to flight
safety, property or life. Examples include but are not limited to tornadoes, heavy snow, and
winds greater than 50 knots.

Terminal Aerodrome – The area within a 5-nautical mile (nm) radius of the center point of
the BAFB runway complex.
Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF)— A 30-hour forecast for cloud layers, prevailing
visibility, weather, obstructions to visibility, surface winds, altimeter setting, and icing and
turbulence from the surface to 10,000 ft mean sea level (MSL).
Thunderstorm (TSTM)— Atmospheric condition consisting of lightning (LTG), thunder, and
heavy precipitation. Potential exists for gusty winds, hail, severe turbulence, icing, and wind
shear.
Vicinity (VC)— The area between 5- and 10-statute miles of the center point of the Buckley
AFB runway complex.
Weather Advisory— A special message disseminated via current weather system, which
notifies supported organizations of established weather conditions that require certain protective
actions by various base agencies.
Weather Warning— A special message transmitted over the current weather system to
highlight established weather conditions that require certain protective actions by various base
agencies. A weather warning will be issued when an established weather condition of such
intensity as to pose a hazard to flight safety, property, or life is occurring or is expected to occur.
Warnings will be amended, upgraded, or canceled as required to accurately reflect conditions.

Warnings issued for BAFB are for conditions forecast to affect the terminal aerodrome, and must
be issued by a certified weather forecaster.
Weather Watch— A special message transmitted over current weather systems to advise
supported agencies of the potential for an established weather condition to occur within 10 nm of
BAFB. The criteria for these are listed in Attachment 8. If required, weather watches will be
upgraded to weather warnings. Agencies should review required actions on receipt of a weather
watch.

NOTE: Meteorological equipment problems shall be reported to ASM personnel when
noted. However, ASM personnel response to the problem may be deferred until normal
duty hours. Weather Operations’ daily operational requirements (i.e. aircraft operations,
mission requirements, customer needs, etc.) will dictate the exact restoration priority and
response by ASM technicians. ASM technicians will take such factors as safety, security,
and weather conditions into consideration when responding to all weather operations’
requests for assistance.
