   The AN/GSN-12(V) is the operations segment of the AN/GPN- 24(V) terminal radar air traffic control
system. The ASR radar segment of the system is the AN/GPN-20(V). Either the AN/GPN- 22(V) or the
AN/FPN-62 PAR radar sets may be connected to the OPS segment, through remote microwave link (RML) or
landlines, to complete the system. Operator positions in the OPS segment provide controllers ASR and PAR
displays, controls, and communications facilities. Landlines connect the OPS segment to the control tower,
runway visual range system, weather dissemination system, wind speed and direction system, and up to 26
remote radio channels. The ASR and PAR segments are capable of 24 hour operation with minimal
maintenance. Figure 1-l shows the ASR portion of the OPS segment. Basic and expanded configurations of
the OPS segment are displayed in figure 1-2. Three ASR and two PAR positions are available in the basic
configuration, five ASR and three PAR in the expanded configuration. Table 1-l provides a listing of
available communications equipment.

WIND DIRECTION AND Provides the controller wind direction (in 10 degree increments) and
SPEED INDICATORS            speed (in 2 knot increments) information.
(l and 2, figure 2-1)

DIGITAL CLOCK                      Provides a time readout in hours, minutes, and seconds. Set the clock (3,
figure 2 -1)                       from the front panel by placing the S/R (set/run) toggleswitch (6, figure
                                   2-1) to S. This activates the pushbutton switches (4, figure 2-1) and
                                   resets the seconds display to zero. The pushbutton switches advance
                                   the display digits independently without overflow into the next higher
                                   digit. Return the toggle switch to the R position for normal operation.

CLOCK POWER                        A 2 position toggle switch that controls operating power to the clock.

                                               ASR MONITOR

The ASR monitor (figure 2-2) provides the controller a visual indication of the surveillance radar
performance. Indicator 1amp intensity is control1ed by the ILLUM control (1, figure 2-2). When channels A
and B are operating properly, the green NORMAL lamps (2 and 7, figure 2-2 ) will be 1it. When system
degradation occurs, one or both of the amber DEGRADED lamps (3 and 6, figure 2-2 ) will light. The
controller may continue to use the display or if the radar presentation is acceptable. If the display is
unacceptable, or if the red FAIL lamps (4 and 5, figure 2-2) light, the controller should switch to
single-channel operation by using the ASR System Control Panel on the supervisor console. The controller
should select a channel that has a NORMAL indication. If both channels indicate a DEGRADED or FAIL
condition when the radar is operating in the frequency diversity configuration, the controller
should first select channel A, then channel B, single-channel operation. Leave the channel that has a
NORMAL indication on-line. All DEGRADED or FAIL conditions must be reported to maintenance
personnel. The controller must be aware that single-channel operation reduces the strength of radar
returns and the intensity of radar video. System failure or degradation will not effect beacon target
information unless the failure is in the ASR antenna rotation system. The momentary LAMP TEST switch
(8, figure 2-2) provides a means of identifying faulty ASR Monitor lamps.



                                        RVR DISPLAY EQUIPMENT



The Runway Visual Range ( RVR ) Programmer and Remote Display (figure 2-3) consist of 3 sections that
display the visibility of an associated runway in hundreds of feet. The 3 digit display (1, figure 2-3 ) provide
a digital visibility readout for the runway selected (13, figure 2-3) on the RVR Remote display programmer
located at ASR position 6. The D and N lamps (4 and 6, figure 2-3) indicate whether readout calculations are
based on day (D) or night (N) 1ight conditions. Calculations also consider the runway 1ight intensity
setting that is indicated by the lamps labeled 3, 4, and 5 (3, 5, and 7, figure 2-3). If the RVR falls below a
range that is preset on the Display Programmer with the ALARM SET (12, figure 2-3 ), the ALARM lamp ( 2,
figure 2-3 ) will i11uminate and an aural alarm wi11 sound. Intensity of the D, N, 3, 4, and 5 lamps is
controlled by the ILLUM control (11, figure 2- 3). The SCRIBBLE STRIP (8, figure 2-3) is used to mark the
runway numbers associated with each readout section. Use a grease pencil or other suitable nonabrasive
marker. The POWER ON/OFF switch (10, figure 2-3) controls power to the display panels. The indicating
fuse holder (9, figure 2-3) will illuminate when there is a blown fuse in the display panel power line.

                                                             MONITOR SELECT UNIT

Each monitor select unit consists of three 3-position toggle switches (1, figure 2-4) to provide the controller
the capability of monitoring a conversation at another position, or allows a conversation between the
selecting and the selected operators. Table 1-1 lists the number of monitor channels available at each
position. When the monitor select switch is held in the AUDIO (up) position, two-way communications
(headset-to-headset) are established between the selected and selecting positions. The switch is spring
loaded and returns to the off (center) position when released from the AUDIO position. When the switch is
set to the MON (monitor) position, the controller is able to monitor the conversation of the selected
position. PHONE LEVEL, ILLUU, and SPKR LEVEL (2, 3, and 4, figure 2-4) controls are self explanatory.

                       MASTER COMMUNICATIONS/SUPERVISOR CONSOLE

The Master Communications/Supervisor console (figure 3-1 ) provides access to all available
communications equipment, voice recorder remote monitors, and the ASR System/Receiver Control Panel.
Table 1-l lists the communications equipment available at the supervisor console. Detailed descriptions and
operational procedures for the communications equipment are covered in AT-E-l 4.




                         Figure 3-l, Master Communications/Supervisor Console
The supervisor console has several controls that apply to general conditions within the AN/GSN-12
Operations shelter. All controllers within the shelter should be aware of the location and the specific
function of these controls.

OVERHEAD LIGHT                       The OVERHEAD LIGHT DIMMER control (l, figure 3-1) turns on,
                                     turns off, and varies the intensity of the operations shelter overhead
                                     fluorescent lamps.

LISHT SW ADJ               The LIGHT SWITCH ADJ (Light Switch Adjust) control (2, figure
                                  3-1) turns on, turns off, and varies the intensity of the floorlights within
                                  the operations shelter. These lights are a safety feature designed
                                  to prevent personnel from tripping over objects on or near the shelter
                                  floor.

FUSE OUT ALARM                       The fuse out alarm mute control (3, figure 3-1) is a momentary lighted
MUTE CONTROL                         pushbutton switch used to distinguish between the fuse out alarm and
                                     the bail-out alarm as both of the alarms sound the same. If the fuse out
                                     alarm comes on, pressing the alarm mute switch will immediately shut
                                     off the alarm and fuse out light will remain on. Notify maintenance
                                     personnel as the light will remain on until the fuse is replaced. If it is
                                     the bail-out alarm that comes on, pressing the alarm mute switch will
                                     not shut off the alarm.

                                                                    WARNING

                                     If pressing the fuse out alarm mute switch does not shut off the alarm,
                                     evacuate the shelter immediately as it may be the bail-out alarm.

RECEIVER CONTROL                     A six position rotary switch (4, figure 3-1) that is located below the
SELECTOR                             SYSTEM CONTROL PANEL. The switch is labeled SUPVR, 1, 4, 6,
                                     11 and 13, corresponding to the Supervisor's position and each of the
                                     ASR positions. The switch is used to transfer control of the ASR
                                     receiver sensitivity to any one of the ASR controller positions. When
                                     set to the SUPV position, the ASR receiver sensitivity is controlled by
                                     receiver sensitivity settings on the Receiver Control Panel.
                                 SYSTEM/RECE IVER CONTROL PANEL

The System/Receiver Control Panel (figure 3-2) consists of several switch-indicators (lighted pushbuttons)
and indicator lights that control and display the status of the surveillance radar. Controls to transfer control
of the system between the operations shelter and the maintenance shelter are provided. Channel selection
functions are also performed at the panel.

1      RELEASE CONTROL/NO CONTROL: A two-section momentary pushbutton switch lamp. The
       switch is used to transfer control of the ASR radar from the supervisor's position to maintenance.
       The RELEASE CONTROL switch at the supervisor's position and the TAKE CONTROL switch in
       the maintenance segment must be pressed in that order to transfer control. The audible alarm (20)
       wi11 sound during transfer. The NO CONTROL 1amp at the supervisor's position will light to
       indicate the transfer is comp lete.

2      TAKE CONTROL/IN CONTROL: A two-section momentary pushbutton switch lamp. The
       switch is used to transfer ASR radar control from maintenance to the supervisor's panel. The
       RELEASE CONTROL switch in the maintenance segment and the TAKE CONTROL switch at the
       supervisor's position must be pressed in that order to transfer control. The audible alarm (20) wi11
       sound during transfer. The IN CONTROL 1amp at the supervisor's position will light to indicate the
       transfer is complete.

3      NO CONTROL: Lights YELLOW to indicate the corresponding channel is in the maintenance
       mode. There is one indicator each for channel A and B.

4      READY/MASTER DIV ON: A two-section indicator, one indicator each for channel A and B. The
       upper section (READY) lights GREEN to indicate that all units in that channel are available for
       normal operation. The lower section (MASTER DIV ON) lights WHITE to indicate the
       corresponding channel is selected as the master channel and both channels are available for
       operation in the diversity mode.

5    ALARM: Lights RED to indicate a fault has occurred in the corresponding ASR channel. If the
     ALARM indicator lights RED, the standby channel (A or B) must be selected by using the ON
     LINE/OFF LINE switches (6), the ANTENNA ON/ANTENNA OFF switch (8), and the HV            ON/HV
OFF switches (7) on the panel. Notify maintenance personnel.

6      ON LINE/OFF LINE: A two-section momentary pushbutton switch lamp, one switch each for
       channel A and B, used to apply the transmitted signal to either the antenna or the dummy load. The
       upper section (ON LINE) lights GREEN to indicate the signal is applied to the antenna. The lower
       section (OFF LINE) lights WHITE to indicate the signal is applied to the dummy load. Pressing the
       switch alternately selects the antenna and the dummy load.

The Following procedures provide instructions for remote (OPS segment) operation of Radar Set under
normal operating conditions.

                                      TRANSFER OF ASR CONTROL

ASR system control may be transferred between the maintenance segment and the operations segment
system control panels. Control transfer requires coordination between personnel at both locations. This
feature is provided to prevent equipment status changes during operation or maintenance by personnel
in the location not in control. Perform the following procedures, in the sequence listed, to transfer control of
the system.

1. Establish intercom communications between the maintenance segment and the operations segment.

2. To release control, depress and hold the RELEASE CONTROL switch on the active SYSTEM CONTROL
panel (panel that has the IN CONTROL indicator).

3. Depress the TAKE CONTROL switch on the other SYSTEM CONTROL panel. The IN CONTROL
indicator lights and the NO CONTROL indicator extinguishes when the transfer is complete. The SYSTEM
CONTROL panel audible alarm sounds during transfer.

4. Release the RELEASE CONTROL switch on the panel that has released control when the audible alarm
terminates. The NO CONTROL indicator on this panel will now be lighted and the IN CONTROL indicator
extinguished. Transfer is now complete.


                                  FREQUENCY DIVERSITY OPERATIOM

The following instructions are for changing the ASR mode of operation from single-channel operation to
dual-channel frequency-diversity operation.

1. Depress ANTENNA ON/ANTENNA OFF switch on the SYSTEM CONTROL panel to the ANTENNA
ON position (ANTENNA ON indicator will light).

2. Observe that the CHANNEL A and B READY indicators are lighted on the SYSTEM CONTROL panel.

3. Depress CHANNEL A and B HV ON/OFF switches to HV ON ( HV ON indicator will light) for 10 seconds.
Then depress CHANNEL A and B HV ON/OFF to HV OFF (HV OFF indicators will light).
4. Depress the CHANNEL A and B ON LINE/OFF LINE switches to the ON LINE position (ON LINE
indicators will light).

5. Depress the CHANNEL A and B HV ON/HV OFF switches to the HV ON (HV ON indicators will light)
position. The channel 's HV ON/HV OFF switch that is depressed first selects that channel as the Master
Channel. The ASR system is now operating in frequency diversity.

                           MASTER CHANNEL CHANGEOVER OPERATION

The following procedures provide instructions for changing the Master Channel when the ASR system is
operating in frequency diversity.

1. Depress the Master Channel HV ON/HV OFF switch to HV OFF (HV OFF indicator is lighted). Note that
the Masher Channel ALARM indicator is lighted. The system now automatically selects the other channel
as the Master Channel.

2. Again depress the same Master Channel HV ON/HV OFF switch to HV ON (HV ON indicator will light).
The Master Channel ALARM indicator will extinguish. The MASTER DIV ON indicator on the new Master
Channel will light and the MASTER DIV ON on the previous Master Channel will extinguish. the Master
designation is now changed over to the other channel.

                                   SINGLE CHANNEL OPERATION

The following procedures provide instructions for changing the ASR mode of operation from frequency
diversity or off -line maintenance to single-channel operation.

1. Depress the ANTENNA ON/ANTENNA OFF switch to the ANTENNA ON position and observe that the
READY indicator for the selected channel is lighted.

2. Depress the HV ON/HV OFF switch of the selected channel to HV ON and the other channel HV ON/HV
OFF switch to HV OFF.

3. Depress the ON LINE/OFF LINE switch of the selected channel to the ON LINE ( ON LINE indicator will
light) position. Depress the other channel ON LINE/OFF LINE switch to the OFF LINE position as follows:
if the alternate channel is to be placed in the standby mode, select OFF LINE at the SYSTEM
CONTROL panel; if the alternate channel is to be placed in the maintenance mode, select OFF LINE at the
SYSTEM CONTROL panel and then have maintenance personnel in the maintenance segment press OFF
LINE at Maintenance Control Panel.

malfunctions occur:

When an equipment failure occurs, notify maintenance personnel as soon as possible to restore system
operation.

                                    OPS SEGMENT BAIL-OUT ALARM

The OPS Segment Bail-Out Alarm is activated by personnel from a remote site (normally the control tower)
to warn personnel in the Of Segment of an impending hazard that would jeopardize their safety. When the
alarm sounds, it may be the Bail-Out Alarm or the communications equipment fuse-out alarm as
they both sound the same. Immediately press the Fuse-Out Alarm Mute Switch at the supervisor's console.
If the alarm continues to sound when the switch is pressed, all personnel must evacuate the OPS Segment
immediately. If the alarm is silenced after pressing the switch, notify maintenance personnel of the
communications system fuse failure.

                                  OPS SEGMENT AC POWER FAILURE

A back -up emergency power battery system is provided in the OPS segment in case of an AC power failure.
The battery system provides continued operation of the communications equipment, bail-out alarm system,
and the obstruction lights for up to 10 minutes. Additionally, the OPS segment emergency lights
will operate for 12 minutes.

                                              ASR FAILURES

Table 6-1 lists possible fault indications, caused by partial equipment failure, that can be observed on ASR
display consoles, performance monitors, or the system and receiver control panel. The remedial actions
listed in table 6-1 provide instructions for the controller if a failure occurs. If a complete failure to the
primary (ASR) or secondary (Beacon) radar occurs, the operating radar system can be used for controlling
aircraft unti1 the other radar system is operational. The controller observing the fault indication should
promptly notify the supervisor, in addition to performing the remedial action listed in table 6-1.
