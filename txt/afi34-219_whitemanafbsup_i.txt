1.5. Dram Shop Liability. The "Dram Shop" theory is a legal theory of liability, created either
by statute or court decision, which imposes upon the owner, operator, and (or) employees of any
establishment serving alcoholic beverages the duty to refuse to serve additional alcoholic
beverages to a customer who reaches or appears to be reaching the point of intoxication. When
an establishment continues to sell alcoholic beverages to such a customer and the customer
subsequently departs and causes harm to himself or herself , or to others, the owner, operator,
and (or) employees of the establishment can be held liable for damages. To protect the assets and
interests of Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIs) and the Air Force, personnel must
adhere to the following procedures:
     1.5.1. Flight chiefs write and publish operating instructions (OIs) that prohibit personnel
     from serving alcoholic beverages to individuals who appear intoxicated or close to being
     intoxicated.
        1.5.1.1. Servers record their understanding of this policy in the employee’s work folder,
        Supervisor’s Employee Brief, by signing underneath this statement: "I understand my
        responsibility under the dram shop theory of liability not to sell or serve alcoholic
        beverages to persons who appear to be nearing intoxication and not in complete control
        of their faculties." The statement is placed in the comments section of the employee’s
        work folder by the server’s supervisor.
        1.5.1.2. The AAFES Commander prescribes the statement to be signed by all AAFES
        employees.
     1.5.2. Activity managers ensure proper safeguards or controls to protect the welfare of an
     intoxicated patron.
AFI34-219_WHITEMANSUP_I 20 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                          7


   1.5.3. Activity managers promptly report any incident that may result in a potential claim to
   the Services commander or division chief (refer to AFI 34-208, Property and Casualty
   Program). AAFES activity managers will report to the AAFES general manager for the base.
1.6. Drunk and Drugged Driving Program. Under the direct guidance of the installation
commander, the Services commander or division chief and AAFES manager, must be familiar
with the spirit and intent of all Air Force initiatives to eliminate drunk or drugged driving
incidents involving patrons of base Services and AAFES facilities.
   1.6.1. The installation commander ensures the base holds annual training programs to
   familiarize beverage supervisors and servers with Air Force drinking policies.
   1.6.2. The training must cover:
       1.6.2.1. Principles of dram shop liability.
       1.6.2.2. Methods for identifying intoxicated patrons.
       1.6.2.3. Recommended procedures to prevent individuals from driving under the
       influence of alcohol.
   1.6.3. Supervisors document this training in each employee’s work folder.
   1.6.4. AAFES conducts the training for its employees.
   1.6.5. Flight chiefs must develop OIs for activities serving alcoholic beverages. The OIs
   must emphasize:
       1.6.5.1. The importance of curtailing alcohol or drug influenced incidents.
       1.6.5.2. The principles of dram shop liability.
       1.6.5.3. The responsibilities of employees in carrying out the drunk and drugged driving
       program.
       1.6.5.4. The importance of encouraging patrons to use a "designated driver" or "buddy"
       system.
       1.6.5.5. The provisions of the alcohol deglamorization program.
1.7. Alcohol Deglamorization Program. Installation commanders, AAFES managers, and
Services activity managers implement the Air Force’s Alcohol Deglamorization Program at the
base level.
   1.7.1. To oversee the base program, installation commanders follow these procedures:
       1.7.1.1. Use base media (newspapers, bulletins, etc.) to deglamorize alcohol, call for
       responsible drinking, and show that alcoholism is a treatable condition.
       1.7.1.2. Ensure activities serving alcoholic beverages don’t promote excessive drinking.
       1.7.1.3. Ensure activities serving alcoholic beverages also offer nonalcoholic beverages.

     SELLING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES FOR OFF-PREMISE CONSUMPTION

3.1. AAFES. AAFES is designated as the single manager of packaged alcoholic beverage
(Class Six) stores and the prime wholesaler of alcoholic beverages. The Air Force packaged
beverage policy appears in AFJI 34-210, Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES)
Operating Policies.
3.1. (WHITEMAN)Alcoholic beverages may be provided and consumed at unit functions
at on-base areas not designated for this purpose when approved by the 509
BW/CC. Requests to provide alcoholic beverages at unit functions must be approved 10 days in
advance and adhere to the following guidelines.
   3.1.1. (Added-WHITEMAN) A unit function is defined as any event, party or special
   occasion that takes place on base, at a specified location; that is scheduled primarily for the
   benefit of a group, squadron, flight, or specific organization (examples of unit functions
   include but are not limited to: Retirements, going away parties, annual picnics, bivouacs,
   dining-ins and events that are designed to benefit the morale and welfare of the unit).
   Occasions that are purely social in nature and that are hosted in a non-official capacity do not
   qualify as a unit function.
   3.1.2. (Added-WHITEMAN) Requests to provide alcoholic beverages at unit functions
   will be routed through Services/MWR in the 509 FSS, the 509th Bomb Wing Staff Judge

   submitted utilizing the appropriate format (see Attachment 1).
   3.1.3. (Added-WHITEMAN) As alcoholic beverages must be controlled and the

3.2. Base Services Activities. Services and other Air Force activities may not compete with
AAFES to sell packaged alcoholic beverages. When approved by the installation commander,
Services activities may sell beer, wine coolers, and other commercially packaged alcoholic
beverages with less than seven percent alcoholic content by volume for off-premises
consumption, but must restrict these sales to time periods when AAFES-operated retail outlets on
the installation are closed. Services may not offer package alcohol for a lower price than AAFES
charges for the same item.
   3.2.1. Packaged beer or wine sales that Services offers as part of a party contract or takeout
   food and beverage operation are exempt from this restriction. Takeout operations normally
   may only sell 6-pack containers and similarly packaged products to include keg beer.
   3.2.2. Clubs may sell bottled wines and champagnes listed on the dining room wine list for
   off-premise consumption under these conditions:
       3.2.2.1. Clubs may not set up rooms separate from the dining room to display or sell for
       off-premise consumption.
 16                                    AFI34-219_WHITEMANSUP_I 20 SEPTEMBER 2013


       3.2.2.2. Clubs ensure that dining room list prices comply with the pricing policy
       specified in paragraph 3.6.
   3.2.3. Club and Class Six outlet managers must ensure that package alcohol sales are made
   only to patrons authorized to use the Class Six store. (Refer to paragraph 3.4 for specific
   instructions on authorized patronage and the attachment for the definition of Class Six.)
   Managers must inform patrons of the maximum quantities that an individual may legally
   transport into or through the state, district, territory, or country where the installation-of-
   purchase is located.
3.3. Establishing Class Six Outlets.
   3.3.1. In the United States, installations may operate Class Six outlets when approved by the
   Secretary of the Air Force. AFJI 34-210 contains procedures for establishing a Class Six
   store.
   3.3.2. In foreign areas overseas, installations may operate Class Six outlets where there is no
   contradictory status-of-forces or other country-to-country or local governmental agreement.
       3.3.2.1. MAJCOMs or Field Operating Agencies (FOA) may approve such operations if
       requested by AAFES. MAJCOMs and FOAs must send an information copy of each
       approval to HQ AFSVA/SVPB at least 30 days prior to approving a new Class Six store.
3.4. Authorized Patronage.
   3.4.1. Interservice publication AFJI 34-210 contains AAFES Class Six patronage restrictions
   and identification procedures.
   3.4.2. Authorized patronage in foreign overseas areas must comply with the provisions of
   the status-of-forces or other country-to-country agreements in each country.
3.5. Controlling Sales. Authorized patrons may not sell, exchange, or otherwise divert
packaged alcoholic beverages to unauthorized personnel or for purposes that violate Federal,
state, or local laws, or status-of-forces or other country-to-country agreements.
3.6. Pricing. Services activity managers must ensure their prices for packaged alcoholic
beverages containing less than seven percent alcohol by volume are no lower than those charged
by AAFES and substantially uniform with other military service outlets in the same geographic
area.
3.7. Wholesale Sales. AAFES is the prime wholesaler of alcoholic beverages on Air Force
installations.
   3.7.1. AAFES provides all requested alcoholic beverage products to authorized Services and
   NAF-supported base activities.
   3.7.2. If AAFES has stock shortages, activities selling alcoholic beverages by the drink have
   first priority.
   3.7.3. AAFES sets wholesale prices based on the "landed cost". A Class Six store pays for
   alcohol purchases (the purchase order price that the store pays, adjusted for vendor and
   invoice discounts, plus costs incurred to bring goods to the point of sale). AAFES assesses no
   additional transportation, warehousing distribution, or handling charges.
AFI34-219_WHITEMANSUP_I 20 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                      17


      3.7.3.1. AAFES notifies HQ AFSVA/SVP if exceptional conditions (national disasters,
      transportation strikes, etc.) arise that affect wholesale prices.
   3.7.4. Sale of Class Six merchandise to any non-MWR/NAF organizations or activities will
   be authorized IAW Army Regulation (AR) 215-1/AFR 215-7. Sale price will be at no less
   than full retail price or as determined by Commander, AAFES.
   3.7.5. Services and other NAF-supported activities may purchase alcoholic beverages from
   sources other than AAFES. Compliance with paragraph 1.6 is mandatory.
3.8. Labeling Packaged Alcoholic Beverages.
   3.8.1. Public Law 100-690, Title VIII, Alcoholic Beverages Labeling Act of 1988, 18
   November 1988, requires that all packaged containers of alcoholic beverages for resale on
   military installations bear this statement: “GOVERNMENT WARNING: (1) According to
   the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because
   of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to
   drive a car or operate machinery and may cause health problems.”
   3.8.2. This requirement also applies to foreign packaged beverages that Services activities
   serve or sell overseas.
   3.8.3. The selling activity’s manager must label all beverages that the producer doesn’t label.
   Follow these labeling requirements:
      3.8.3.1. PL 100-690 defines alcoholic beverages as any beverage in liquid form that
      contains not less than one-half of one percent (0.5 percent) of alcohol by volume for
      human consumption.
      3.8.3.2. Design all labels to make the health warning statement readily legible under
      ordinary conditions. The statement must be on a contrasting background.
      3.8.3.3. Label all containers of 237 milliliters (8 ounces) or less: 1 millimeter
      (0.04 inches) sized lettering.
      3.8.3.4. Label all containers of more than 237 milliliters (8 ounces): 2 millimeters
      (0.08 inches) sized lettering.

      application of water or other solvents.
