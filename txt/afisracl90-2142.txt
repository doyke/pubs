This checklist implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-2, Inspector General--The
Inspection System; Air Force Instruction 90-201, Inspector General Activities; and Air Force
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA) Supplement (AFISRASUP) to
Air Force Instruction 90-201, Inspector General Activities. This instruction checklist will be
used to evaluate unit compliance with public law, executive orders, Department of Defense, Air
Force, Major Command (MAJCOM) and other governing authorities’ directives. This
publication applies to all active AFISRA intelligence units. It also applies to AFISRA-
gained/attached Air National Guard (ANG) units when published in ANG Index (ANGIND) 2.
This does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units or members. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command to HQ

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Updated paragraphs 4.3, 4.6, 8.1-8.5; obsolete terms such as RMS were deleted and updated with
GIMS (GEOINT Information Management Services) in paragraph 5.1. The items listed do not
constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection/assessment. As a minimum, units should
use these directives in conjunction with the annual Unit Self-Assessment. The objective is to
identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities. Units can supplement this
publication to add internal compliance items. This directive may be used in whole or in part by
HHQ during visits or exercises. Users may add any items(s), which, in the exercise of good
judgment, requires examination.
1. General The items listed in the attached C&SRL do not limit the scope of the
inspection/assessment or represent the order of item importance. As a minimum, units
should use these directories in conjunction with the annual Unit Self-Assessment. The objective
is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities. Units can supplement
this publication to add internal compliance items. This directory may be used in whole or in part
by HHQ during visits or exercises. Users may add any item(s), which in the exercise of good
judgment, requires examination.
     1.1. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCO). Items defined by the AFISRA staff as key
     result areas for a successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to, items
     where non-compliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost or litigation.
     CCOs are depicted as BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT (Tables 1.1 and 1.2).
     1.2. Core Compliance Items (CCI). Areas that require special vigilance and are important
     to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed “Critical.” Non-compliance would
     result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result in injury, unnecessary
     cost or possible litigation. CCIs are depicted as ALL CAPS FORMAT (Tables 1.1 and 1.2).
     1.3. General Compliance Items (GCI). Areas deemed fundamental to successful overall
     performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal impact on mission
     accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury, increased cost, or possible litigation.
     GCIs are depicted as sentence case format (Tables 1.1 and 1.2).
     1.4. National and Tactical Items. Items designated as national are marked with a “N.”
     Items designed as operational and theater are marked with a “O.” Items designated as
     tactical are marked with a “T.” Items that are designated as national and tactical are marked
     with a “N, O, T.” Item designations can be found on the left side of the item numbers
     (Tables 1.1 and 1.2).
