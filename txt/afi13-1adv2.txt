MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION C
               MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs

FROM: HQ USAF/A3/5

      Washington DC 20330-1480

SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum (AFGM) for AFI 13-1AD Vol. 2

By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force this Guidance Memorandum immediately implements
changes to AFI 13-1 AD Vol. 2 Ground Command and Control Systems
Standardization/Evaluation Program—Region/Sector Air Operations Center Evaluation
Criteria. Specifically, this GM deletes Emergency Action Coordinator (EAC) evaluation
criteria. A separate AFGM will be published to ensure deletion of EAC qualification training
from AFI 13-1 BCC Vol.1.

This Guidance Memorandum (GM) removes the evaluation criteria of the Emergency Action
Coordinator (EAC) as this position is now a certification vice qualification.

*Chapter 13. DELETED

The AFGM supports AFGM 1 to AFI 13-1 BCC Vol.1, Battle Control Center (BCC) Training
that changes the EAC crew position from qualification to a certification.

This Memorandum becomes void after 1 year has elapsed from its date, or upon incorporation by
AFI 13-1 AD Vol.2. There are no releasibility restrictions on this memorandum.

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. This volume gives Standardization/Evaluation Examiners (SEEs) criteria to use
during positional evaluations. It is a reference handbook and a standard for training and
operational purposes. Specific areas are prescribed to ensure an accurate assessment of the
proficiency and capabilities of operations personnel.
1.2. Recommendations for Change. Recommendations for change are encouraged.
Recommendations should focus on specific areas and standards of performance. Forward
comment(s) through channels to MAJCOM using AF Form 847, Recommendations for Change
of Publication. Deviations are not authorized unless approved by HQ ACC/A3YG.
1.3. Supplements/Waiver Authority .
   1.3.1. All proposed supplements to this instruction will be submitted through channels to
   ACC/PACAF/USAFE OPR for approval. MAJCOMs will forward a copy of all approved
   supplements to AF/A3O-AYO.
   1.3.2. Waivers.
       1.3.2.1. Waiver authority for requirements contained in this instruction rests with
       ACC/PACAF/USAFE unless otherwise specified.
       1.3.2.2. Requests for waivers must contain a complete explanation of why the waiver is
       required and corrective actions to be taken.
       1.3.2.3. All waivers for ACC/PACAF/USAFE consideration will be forwarded through
       channels to the applicable MAJCOM. MAJCOMs will forward a copy of all approved
       waivers to AF/A3O-AYO.
1.4. Rating Policies. SEEs will use the rating policies contained in AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL
Volume 2, and the evaluation criteria in this instruction for conducting all positional evaluations.
An overall rating of ―Unqualified‖ could result from an unqualified rating of a single critical or
multiple noncritical areas. All area ratings are based on the three level rating system (Q, Q- and
U) described below and the criteria listed in the individual chapters or areas.
   1.4.1. A Qualified (Q) rating will be given when the examinee accomplishes all tasks in
   accordance with (IAW) subject areas.
   1.4.2. A Qualified-minus area grade (Q-) indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the
   assigned area tasks, but requires a written debriefed comment or additional training as
   determined by the SEE. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the
   prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety.
   1.4.3. If a subject area is accomplished with errors, omissions, deviations, or delays which
   could jeopardize mission accomplishment or compromise safety and security, an Unqualified
   (U) rating will be given for that area.
1.5. Simulation Evaluations. Simulation may be used to administer any portion of a positional
evaluation not requiring a specific live scenario. Unit SEEs will identify existing simulation
scenarios which include adequate activity to meet the evaluation requirements for the required
22                                                            AFI13-1ADV2 24 AUGUST 2009


events. If adequate scenarios did not exist, unit Stan/Eval personnel will develop scenario
outlines for the simulation activity to be conducted to ensure standardization of both the level of
activity and the difficulty for simulation evaluations. The SEE’s judgment will be the
determining factor in the effective use of simulation.
1.6. Evaluation Methods. The primary methods of determining the examinees’ level of job
knowledge and proficiency are academic testing and observation of job performance. The
questioning of examinees during the positional portion of the evaluation should normally be
limited to items not easily determined by observation, but related to the scenarios being
employed for evaluation.
1.7. Critical Areas. Critical areas require a degree of knowledge/proficiency essential for
successful mission accomplishment/safety. Consequently, an ―Unqualified‖ grade in any
―CRITICAL‖ area will result in an overall grade of ―Unqualified.‖

4.1. General.
     4.1.1. This chapter contains the criteria specifying the tasks required of a Basic Qualified
     Senior Director (SD).
     4.1.2. The SD evaluation will consist of the following four positional areas.
        4.1.2.1. The examinee will perform SD duties during a live or simulated scenario (or
        SEE approved daily operation) which involves a minimum of two simultaneous events.
        Verbal examination will be used to evaluate areas not observed during the positional
        portions of the evaluation.
        4.1.2.2. The examinee will control air-to-air training (ACT/DACT/TI), using the
        continuum of control, as briefed by the aircrew. SEEs will make the determination as to
        whether briefed/conducted control activities meet/fulfill control requirements.
        4.1.2.3. The examinee will control an air defense scenario using the continuum of control
        to a minimum of two separate interceptors/elements simultaneously.
        4.1.2.4. The examinee will control air refueling operations using the continuum of
        control to at least two separate receivers/elements simultaneously rendezvousing on one
        or more tankers. The SD evaluation must include performance during a live or simulated
        exercise (IAW AFI 13-1AD Volume 1) and must supervise a minimum of two control
        teams during the exercise. The SD must maintain current weapons qualification IAW AFI
        13-1AD V1. Functional tasks common to both weapons and SD may be evaluated only
        once and credited to both evaluations. The Weapons portion of the evaluation must be
        completed with the SD evaluation to establish the same evaluation window.
4.2. Evaluation Objective. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to accomplish all SD
duties safely and effectively IAW technical orders and operations directives. A rating of Q, Q-
or U will be given to each non-critical area. Critical areas are rated Q or U.

      JASDF BASE AIR DEFENSE GROUND ENVIRONMENT SYSTEM SENIOR
      DIRECTOR/SENIOR DIRECTOR TECH QUALIFICATION EVALUATION

Section 15A—Instructions

15.1. General:
   15.1.1. This chapter contains the criteria specifying the tasks required of a Basic Qualified
   Senior Director (SD)/Senior Director Technician (SDT) and is applicable to 13BXX/1C5X1s
   assigned to the 610ACF and 623ACF. Both the 610ACF and 623ACF will supplement this
   chapter to encompass those responsibilities required during TCOT operations in ACFOI 13-1
   TCOT Crew Employment Standards.
   15.1.2. The SD/SDT evaluation must include performance during daily flying activity that
   supports evaluation objectives. Scenarios for non-flying activities should be used to cover
   areas not normally encountered during daily activity. The SD/SDT must supervise a
   minimum of two control teams during the evaluation. The SD must maintain a controller
   qualification. Functional tasks common to weapons and SD may be evaluated only once and
   credited to both evaluations.
   15.1.3. SDT must have had a prior qualification as a Combat Mission Ready (CMR)
   Weapons Director/Technician (WD/T). Functional tasks common to both WD/T and SD/T
   may be evaluated only once and credited to both evaluations. The differences between the
   SD and SDT evaluations are primarily in scope of responsibilities and the expectation that
   the SDT completes the requirements by assisting the SD.
15.2. Evaluation Objective. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to accomplish all
SD/SDT duties safely and effectively IAW technical orders and operational directives. A rating
of Q, Q- or U will be given to each non-critical area. Critical areas are rated Q or U.

 KOREAN THEATER AIR CONTROL SYSTEM MISSION CREW COMMANDER /
 MISSION CREW COMMANDER TECHNICIAN QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS

Section 18A— Instructions

18.1. Purpose. This chapter, in conjunction with AFI 13-1STAN-EVALV2, gives 621 ACS
assigned Standardization/Evaluation Examiners (SEEs) procedures and criteria to use during
Mission Crew Commander (MCC) / Mission Crew Commander Technician (MCCT)
evaluations. Adherence to these procedures and criteria will ensure an accurate assessment of
the proficiency and capabilities of crewmembers.
18.2. Rating Policies. SEEs will use the rating policies in AFI 13-1STAN-EVAL Volume 2
and this chapter for conducting all evaluations. All area ratings are based on a three level rating
system (Q, Q- and U) described below.
   18.2.1. A Qualified area grade (Q) is the desired level of performance. The examinee
   demonstrates a satisfactory level of knowledge of all required information, performed duties
   within the prescribed tolerances and accomplishes the assigned mission with no
   discrepancies.
   18.2.2. A Qualified-minus area grade (Q-) indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the
   assigned area tasks, but requires a written debriefed comment or additional training as
   determined by the SEE. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the
   prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety.
   18.2.3. An Unqualified area grade (U) is given for performance outside allowable
   parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures that jeopardized mission
   accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee receiving an area grade of "U"
   normally requires additional training. When, in the judgment of the SEE, additional training
   will not constructively improve examinee performance, it is not required, but the SEE will
   thoroughly debrief the examinee.
18.3. Evaluation Methods. The primary method of determining an examinee's level of
knowledge and proficiency is observation of job performance on live missions. When conditions
such as mission availability preclude evaluation of a particular event on a live mission, it may be
evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., mission simulator, verbally or academic ground
evaluation scenario) if allowed in the evaluation requirements section of this chapter. SEEs will
make every effort to evaluate all required areas on a live mission before resorting to alternatives.
Document alternate evaluation methods for each area in the Mission Description section of the
AF Form 4143. The questioning of examinees during the positional portion of the evaluation
should be limited to items not easily determined by observation and related to the scenario being
employed for the evaluation.
18.4. Critical Areas. Critical grading areas are defined as events that require a degree of
knowledge and proficiency essential for safety and mission accomplishment. If an examinee
receives a "U" grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will also be
unqualified. Critical areas are identified by "(Critical)" following the applicable area title.
136                                                          AFI13-1ADV2 24 AUGUST 2009


18.5. Evaluation Requirements. All areas specified in this chapter are required for a complete
positional evaluation.
   18.5.1. The IQE / RQE positional evaluation will demonstrate the examinee’s ability to
   operate mission systems and apply local theater guidance to effectively accomplish the
   mission.
       18.5.1.1. The examinee will complete a written examination derived from the MAJCOM
       Master Question File and unit derived Local Operating Procedures.
       18.5.1.2. The examinee will perform duties as the MCC / MCCT during live daily flying
       operations to support evaluation objectives. The SEE will determine whether the extent
       of live flying activity is sufficient for evaluation purposes. The evaluation may continue
       on a subsequent day to fully meet evaluation requirements. Area 11, Daily Flying
       Operations, must be accomplished live. Other areas may be accomplished by alternate
       methods.
   18.5.2. Upon completion of MQT, Stan/Eval will administer a 25-question, written MQE.
   The passing score is 85 percent. Stan/Eval maintains at least two different tests on file or
   utilized a computer-generated test program. A positional evaluation is not required upon
   completion of MQT.
   18.5.3. Upon successful completion of the MQE, give individuals CMR status and place
   them into CT.
18.6. Evaluation Objective. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to accomplish all
MCC / MCCT duties safely and effectively IAW technical orders and operations directives. A
rating of Q, Q- or U will be given to each area.

19.1. Purpose. This chapter, in conjunction with AFI 13-1STAN-EVALV2, gives 621 ACS
assigned Standardization/Evaluation Examiners (SEEs) procedures and criteria to use during
Weapons Director (WD), Air Weapons Officer (AWO), and Senior Director (SD) evaluations.
Adherence to these procedures and criteria will ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency
and capabilities of crewmembers.
19.2. Rating Policies. SEEs will use the rating policies in AFI 13-1STAN-EVAL Volume 2
and this chapter for conducting all evaluations. All area ratings are based on a three level rating
system (Q, Q- and U) described below.
   19.2.1. A Qualified area grade (Q) is the desired level of performance. The examinee
   demonstrates a satisfactory level of knowledge of all required information, performed duties
   within the prescribed tolerances and accomplishes the assigned mission with no
   discrepancies.
   19.2.2. A Qualified-minus area grade (Q-) indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the
   assigned area tasks, but requires a written debriefed comment or additional training as
   determined by the SEE. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the
   prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety.
   19.2.3. An Unqualified area grade (U) is given for performance outside allowable
   parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures that jeopardized mission
   accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee receiving an area grade of "U"
   normally requires additional training. When, in the judgment of the SEE, additional training
   will not constructively improve examinee performance, it is not required, but the SEE will
   thoroughly debrief the examinee.
19.3. Evaluation Methods. The primary method of determining an examinee's level of
knowledge and proficiency is observation of job performance on live missions. When conditions
such as mission availability preclude evaluation of a particular event on a live mission, it may be
evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., mission simulator, verbally or academic ground
evaluation scenario) if allowed in the evaluation requirements section of this chapter. SEEs will
make every effort to evaluate all required areas on a live mission before resorting to alternatives.
Document alternate evaluation methods for each area in the Mission Description section of the
AF Form 4143. The questioning of examinees during the positional portion of the evaluation
should be limited to items not easily determined by observation and related to the scenario being
employed for the evaluation.
19.4. Critical Areas. Critical grading areas are defined as events that require a degree of
knowledge and proficiency essential for safety and mission accomplishment. If an examinee
receives a "U" grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will also be
unqualified. Critical areas are identified by "(Critical)" following the applicable area title.

19.5. Evaluation Requirements. All areas specified in this chapter are required for a complete
positional evaluation.
     19.5.1. The IQE / RQE positional evaluation will test an individual’s ability to operate
     equipment and integrate with the crew to accomplish a mission. An ―SD Upgrade IQE‖ is
     defined as an evaluation given to a 621 ACS CMR AWO who has completed required SD
     training through DOT. Positional evaluations for upgrade to SD from AWO will include all
     grading areas necessary to perform the supervisory role. The SD evaluation will include SD,
     air-to-air, check-in and air-refueling criteria.
        19.5.1.1. The examinee will complete an IQE written examination derived from the
        PACAF Master Question File and unit derived Local Operating Procedures.
        19.5.1.2. The examinee will perform duties as the WD/AWO or SD during live daily
        flying operations to support evaluation objectives. The SEE will determine whether the
        extent of live flying activity is sufficient for evaluation purposes. The evaluation may
        continue on a subsequent day to fully meet evaluation requirements. Area 16, Weapons
        Control Supervision (Critical) (SD Only), must be accomplished live.
        19.5.1.3. Evaluation requirements for the Air-to-Air portion of the qualification are to
        control a 2v2 or greater mission. This must be a two-scope, two-frequency control event
        and must be accomplished live.
        19.5.1.4. Evaluation requirements for the Air Refueling portion of the qualification are to
        simultaneously control two flights of receivers and the tanker. Examinee must
        demonstrate the ability to close control, providing positioning geometry to both tanker
        and receiver for an effective rendezvous. Due to operational constraints, this portion will
        normally be accomplished in the simulator.
        19.5.1.5. Evaluation requirements for the Check-In portion of the qualification are to
        control five flights from check-in to check-out. This control event must be accomplished
        live.
     19.5.2. Upon completion of MQT, Stan/Eval will administer a 25-question, written MQE.
     The passing score is 85 percent. Stan/Eval maintains at least two different tests on file or
     utilized a computer-generated test program. A positional evaluation is not required upon
     completion of MQT.
     19.5.3. Upon successful completion of the MQE, give individuals CMR status and place
     them into CT.
19.6. Evaluation Objective. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to accomplish all
duties safely and effectively IAW technical orders and operations directives. A rating of Q, Q-
or U will be given to each area.

Section 20A— Instructions

20.1. Purpose. This chapter, in conjunction with AFI 13-1STAN-EVALV2, gives 621 ACS
assigned Standardization/Evaluation Examiners (SEEs) procedures and criteria to use during
Data System Technician (DST) evaluations. Adherence to these procedures and criteria will
ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of crewmembers.
20.2. Rating Policies. SEEs will use the rating policies in AFI 13-1STAN-EVAL Volume 2
and this chapter for conducting all evaluations. All area ratings are based on a three level rating
system (Q, Q- and U) described below.
   20.2.1. A Qualified area grade (Q) is the desired level of performance. The examinee
   demonstrates a satisfactory level of knowledge of all required information, performed duties
   within the prescribed tolerances and accomplishes the assigned mission with no
   discrepancies.
   20.2.2. A Qualified-minus area grade (Q-) indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the
   assigned area tasks, but requires a written debriefed comment or additional training as
   determined by the SEE. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the
   prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety.
   20.2.3. An Unqualified area grade (U) is given for performance outside allowable
   parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures that jeopardized mission
   accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee receiving an area grade of "U"
   normally requires additional training. When, in the judgment of the SEE, additional training
   will not constructively improve examinee performance, it is not required, but the SEE will
   thoroughly debrief the examinee.
20.3. Evaluation Methods. The primary method of determining an examinee's level of
knowledge and proficiency is observation of job performance on live missions. When conditions
such as mission availability preclude evaluation of a particular event on a live mission, it may be
evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., mission simulator, verbally or academic ground
evaluation scenario) if allowed in the evaluation requirements section of this chapter. SEEs will
make every effort to evaluate all required areas on a live mission before resorting to alternatives.
Document alternate evaluation methods for each area in the Mission Description section of the
AF Form 4143. The questioning of examinees during the positional portion of the evaluation
should be limited to items not easily determined by observation and related to the scenario being
employed for the evaluation.
20.4. Critical Areas. Critical grading areas are defined as events that require a degree of
knowledge and proficiency essential for safety and mission accomplishment. If an examinee
receives a "U" grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will also be
unqualified. Critical areas are identified by "(Critical)" following the applicable area title.

Section 21A—Evaluation Procedures and Instructions

21.1. Minimum Mission Level. The minimum level of mission that must be accomplished for
the PI is one that is representative of the instructor's duties. Individuals qualified to instruct in a
live environment will accomplish a live air-to-air sortie. Individuals not qualified to instruct in a
live environment will accomplish a simulated training event. A second live or simulated mission
may be utilized to observe areas not adequately evaluated during the first mission.
21.2. Demonstration or Performance Session. During the mission, the examinee will conduct
a demonstration or performance session. The event will be task oriented to allow the examinee to
make necessary inputs. The SEE is responsible for determining if the examinee has met
demonstration or performance requirements. The student's performance during the mission does
not determine whether this area is rated satisfactory.
21.3. Evaluation Objective. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to instruct safely and
effectively IAW directives.

21.4. Areas and Ratings. SEEs will use the rating policies in AFI 13-1STAN-EVAL Volume 2
and this chapter for conducting all evaluations. All area ratings are based on a three level rating
system (Q, Q- and U) described below.
   21.4.1. A Qualified area grade (Q) is the desired level of performance. The examinee
   demonstrates a satisfactory level of knowledge of all required information, performed duties
   within the prescribed tolerances and accomplishes the assigned mission with no
   discrepancies.
   21.4.2. A Qualified-minus area grade (Q-) indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the
   assigned area tasks, but requires a written debriefed comment or additional training as
154                                                          AFI13-1ADV2 24 AUGUST 2009


   determined by the SEE. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the
   prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety.
   21.4.3. An Unqualified area grade (U) is given for performance outside allowable
   parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures that jeopardized mission
   accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee receiving an area grade of "U"
   normally requires additional training. When, in the judgment of the SEE, additional training
   will not constructively improve examinee performance, it is not required, but the SEE will
   thoroughly debrief the examinee.
21.5. Area 1 – MISSION PLANNING.
