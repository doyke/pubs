                   CERTIFICATION AND PROFICIENCY TRAINING

3.1. Training Processes. The 576 FLTS will develop processes to conduct training of test
operations personnel and provide feedback to the individual and FLTS/CC on test operations
personnel’s demonstrated performance in order to fulfill training program requirements outlined
in this instruction. Reference Air Force Handbook (AFH) 36-2235v11, Information for
Designers of Instructional Systems Application to Unit Training, for all instructional material
development.
   3.1.1. Only certified instructors, or personnel under the supervision of a certified instructor,
   will administer training.
   3.1.2. Training programs must be designed and implemented using performance standards to
   provide and maintain the essential skills, knowledge, and motivation required for mission
   accomplishment. Identified deficiencies will also be corrected through the training
   programs.
   3.1.3. The 576 FLTS will ensure all proficiency training is accomplished at least once every
   12 months.
       3.1.3.1. JPRs will be trained to the proficiency level indicated in the JPRL.
   3.1.4. The 576 FLTS will develop and maintain a Plan of Instruction (POI) to guide training
   and implement training program requirements outlined in this instruction.
3.2. Training Methods.
   3.2.1. Simulator Training. The Countdown Procedures Trainer (CPT) provides a controlled
   off-line environment to emphasize team interaction, dynamics and prioritization in a realistic
   environment.
       3.2.1.1. When possible, the 576 FLTS should maximize use of an off-line environment
       to conduct training.
       3.2.1.2. Prior to conducting a training session in the operational environment, units must
       gauge impact to airborne operations before dispatching instructors or trainees. Units may
       develop an operational risk management (ORM) assessment tool to ensure decisions
       mitigate any adverse operational impact.
   3.2.2. Classroom Training. Classroom training sessions are designed to facilitate discussion
   of weapon system concepts, operations, and problems.
       3.2.2.1. Training and tasks that are presented to the students will be in a standard lesson
       plan format.
   3.2.3. Individual training. Position specific training provided by individuals previously
   holding team position (e.g. on-the-job training). This training is informal in nature, but is
   critical to mission success.
3.3. Proficiency Training.
 10                                                    AFGSCI 13-5303V1 9 OCTOBER 2012


   3.3.1. Initial Training (IT). IT provides system specific and positional specific training as a
   precursor to mission certification training (MCT).
       3.3.1.1. Required JPR coverage for IT is outlined in the JPRL.
       3.3.1.2. The 576 FLTS will develop and maintain a formal training program for IT.
   3.3.2. Recurring Training (RT). RT emphasizes knowledge and skills not used on a routine
   basis and knowledge and skill deficiencies identified through feedback. RT provides the
   medium for knowledge enhancement training. The training increases a person’s knowledge

                          TRAINING SCENARIOS AND SCRIPTS

4.1. Training Scenarios. The purpose of a training scenario is to reinforce classroom training,
guide individual self-study, allow students to demonstrate proficiency in performance level tasks
and to maintain an individual’s or team’s proficiency. Training scenarios will test the ability to
multi-task, and force personnel to react to situations ranging from fundamental to complex in a
controlled environment. Scenarios will emphasize knowledge and skills necessary to execute the
mission.
   4.1.1. Team members must receive proper configuration and status for operational realism.
   4.1.2. Scenarios administered to an individual or team may consist of a single task, a group
   of tasks strung together or multiple tasks occurring simultaneously.
   4.1.3. Training scenario results are based on individual or team member performance on
   each task or subtask with respect to the applicable performance standard.
   4.1.4. Training in the operational environment may be used for mission dress rehearsals
   (MDRs) or facility checkout.
4.2. Training Scripts. The 576 FLTS will design and use scripts to conduct training in support
of OTL processes and procedures. Scripts will include instructions for instructors, simulated
inputs, and status card inputs as applicable.
   4.2.1. All simulation materials will be marked ―For Training Use Only‖.
   4.2.2. Scripts will contain valid OTL stimuli. Stimuli will be identified by JPR, task
   description, scenario support personnel initiation and response agencies and notes or
   expected responses (e.g., instructor notes and expected trainee response).
       4.2.2.1. Estimated scenario run times, if included, are for scenario presentation only and
       do not establish a time standard for completing actions. Applicable time standards must
       be annotated within the script.
   4.2.3. Do not create actual conditions that could jeopardize personnel safety, cause
   equipment damage or result in mission degradation.
   4.2.4. Scripts must be fully coordinated with scenario support personnel and all other
   participating or approval agencies prior to being used for documented training.
4.3. Briefings. It is the responsibility of the instructors to conduct appropriate briefings
throughout the course of the training session.
   4.3.1. Instructors will conduct a pre-brief to set the environment of the training and to ensure
   the trainee clearly understands expectations, responsibilities, limitations and other rules of
   engagement before being administered training scenarios.
   4.3.2. Safety and operational requirements take priority over simulated activities.
       4.3.2.1. Instructors will intervene to prevent a safety hazard or damage to equipment.
       Additionally, for training conducted in the operational environment, instructors will
       intervene to prevent mission failure or degradation.
 12                                                   AFGSCI 13-5303V1 9 OCTOBER 2012


   4.3.3. Instructors may use briefings as necessary for scenario transitions, scenario
   presentation in accordance with the script and to emphasize concepts presented in the lesson
   plan.
   4.3.4. Instructors will not lead or prompt trainees into taking a correct action. To ensure
   effective use of training resources and prevent improper procedures from being reinforced,
   they may step in to redirect trainees once they are satisfied the crew is accomplishing
   incorrect actions or failing to accomplish required actions.
       4.3.4.1. Provide training to correct deficiencies and reinforce the proper actions for task
       accomplishment as soon as practical after a trainee takes an incorrect action.
4.4. Scenario Termination. Once a training session is started, all efforts will be made by the
instructor to complete the session.
   4.4.1. Situations may arise in which early termination would be required. Training scenarios
   terminated early may be re-initiated from the point activity was originally stopped, or it may
   be completely re-accomplished.
4.5. Outbriefing the Trainee. The outbrief provides feedback to the trainee and the training
program.
   4.5.1. The outbrief will include discussion of positive performance, strengths, any noted
   deficiencies, root causes, areas for improvement and direct or indirect impacts to the mission,
   personnel, and other organizations.

                TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION DOCUMENTATION

6.1. Training Documentation. Upon completion of each training session, instructors will
document the training administered to provide a means to track individual performance or
progression and to contribute to internal and external feedback on training program
effectiveness.
   6.1.1. Document all training and deficiencies on electronic or paper forms.
   6.1.2. All training documentation will be retained for the previous calendar year, and up to
   the current month of the current year.
6.2. Documenting Deficiencies. Documenting identified deficiencies provides a means to
identify trends, track individual performance, provides performance feedback to the individual’s
supervisor and serves as a key feedback and training program tool.
   6.2.1. When the trainee causes a script deviation and an incorrect action results, the
   instructor will document deficiencies against the JPR to which the deficiency should be
   attributed.
       6.2.1.1. If test operations personnel recognize a status change but fails to perform a
       required JPR, document the deviation against the JPR that should have been performed.
       6.2.1.2. If test operations personnel recognize a status change but performs the wrong
       JPR, document the deviation against the JPR that should have been performed. However,
       give JPR credit for the task or subtask that was performed.
       6.2.1.3. If test operations personnel do not recognize a status change and a resulting task
       or subtask requirement, document the deviation against the required JPR.
       6.2.1.4. When the JPR being performed directs transition to another task or subtask, and
       the trainee fails to perform the subsequent task or subtask or fails to identify the
       requirement to transition, document the deviation against the JPR that directed the
       transition.
       6.2.1.5. If test operations personnel perform an unnecessary action which causes or
       results in a deviation, document the deviation against the JPR being performed when the
       unnecessary action was taken.
   6.2.2. Use Attachment 2 (Deficiency Codes) to describe the root cause of a trainee’s
   deficiency.
   6.2.3. Instructors will forward script discrepancies to the script OPR.
6.3. Training Reports (OTL only). A standardized training report will be used for proficiency
and mission certification training sessions for each individual to document details of the
administered training.
   6.3.1. Test team members will receive credit for a JPR by performing any portion of a task,
   regardless if a checklist is used or if all actions are contained within another checklist.
 16                                                   AFGSCI 13-5303V1 9 OCTOBER 2012


       6.3.1.1. The instructor awarding JPR credit is documenting the individual has been
       adequately trained on the task.
6.4. Individual Qualification Folders. The 576 FLTS will maintain individual training and
evaluation documentation in an Individual Qualification Folder (IQF) for all test operations
personnel as well as MD certified personnel. Electronic formatted IQFs are authorized provided
proper security measures, backup capability, and sustainment plans are in place.
   6.4.1. Use of the TTCT is mandatory. The form will be used to document the individual’s
   entire duty and qualification history while assigned to the 576 FLTS.
       6.4.1.1. Software applications capturing the same information obtained by the TTCT are
       authorized provided the unit gains AFGSC/A3T approval prior to use. Reference AFI
       33-360 for guidance on gaining approval.
       6.4.1.2. If electronic forms are used, the 576 FLTS will develop a plan to ensure
       adequate security procedures are in place to prevent tampering by unauthorized personnel
       and to document timely back-up and recovery procedures. Regardless of format
       (hardcopy/electronic), the unit is ultimately responsible for the information contained on
       these forms.
   6.4.2. As a minimum, the following information will be documented on the TTCT:
       6.4.2.1. Arrival and Departure from unit.
       6.4.2.2. Completion of initial training.
       6.4.2.3. Certification(s) and decertification(s) will be annotated. The 576 FLTS will
