                                           Chapter 1

                                  PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose. This instruction outlines the responsibilities, policies, and structure of the Air
Force EMF Occupational Health program. It implements the provisions of Department of
Defense Instruction (DODI) 6055.11, Protecting Personnel from Electromagnetic Fields, or
latest version thereof, which requires compliance with all applicable Federal, ANSI, and IEEE
standards.
1.2. Applicability. This instruction applies to all Air Force military members (including the
Reserve and National Guard), Department of the Air Force civilian employees (including foreign
nationals) and to all sources of EMF owned or operated by the US Air Force, or under Air Force
control. Overseas Air Force installations to include deployed locations will comply with this
instruction or the requirements established by the Status of Forces Agreement, whichever is more
stringent. Policies and procedures specific to Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) are not covered
by this instruction but are provided in AFI 91-401, Directed Energy Weapons Safety. This
instruction excludes optical and laser radiation frequencies, standards and reporting which are
covered by AFI 48-139, Laser and Optical Radiation Protection Program. The Maximum
Permissible Exposure (MPE) limits referenced in this instruction are detailed in the Attachment 2
and come from ANSI/IEEE C95.1, IEEE Standard for Safety Levels with Respect to Human
Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 3 kHz to 300 GHz. MPE limits do not
apply to patients who are undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic procedures when EMF
application is specifically prescribed by a physician, e.g., diathermy during physical therapy
treatments, electromagnetic imaging, etc. The MPE does, however, apply to patients or medical
staff who may be exposed incidentally during the medical procedure. The term “overexposure”
used in this instruction refers to EMFR exposures greater than the MPE.
1.3. Regulatory Basis. This document contains the same MPEs used throughout industry as
instructed by DODI 6055.11. Measurement units will follow the MPEs and are derived from the
recommended exposure levels in the current ANSI/IEEE C95.1, IEEE Standard for Safety Levels
with Respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 3 kHz to 300
GHz, which serve as a consensus standard developed by representatives of industry, scientific
communities, government agencies, and the public. Control measures at least as stringent as
those recommended by the current DODI 6055.11 and ANSI/IEEE C95.1, are implemented by
this instruction. Refer also to National Council on Radiation Protection (NCRP) 86, Biological
Effects and Exposure Criteria for Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields, NCRP 119, A
Practical Guide to the Determination of Human Exposure to Radiofrequency Fields, and the
current American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit
Values (TLVs) Booklet for additional information on EMF. IEEE C95 standards are the main
reference for exposure limit values. Refer to AFRL-SA-WP-SR-2013-0003, Base-Level Guide
for Electromagnetic Field Radiation for further guidance information on how to implement this
instruction in applying regulatory standards.

                                         Chapter 3

       EXPOSURE STANDARDS AND PERSONNEL PROTECTION POLICIES

3.1. EMF Protection Standards.
   3.1.1. Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE). As detailed in Attachment 2, the Air Force
   will implement a two tiered approach with action level requirements for MPEs as follows:
   (T-0)
      3.1.1.1. Upper Tier (formerly, Controlled Environment) MPEs include the following:
          3.1.1.1.1. Exposure that may be incurred by personnel who are aware of the potential
          for EMF exposures conjoined with their employment or duties.
          3.1.1.1.2. Exposure of other cognizant individuals.
          3.1.1.1.3. Exposure that is the incidental result of passage through such areas where
          analysis shows the levels may exceed those given in the lower tier MPE table (Table
          A.2.2. and Table 5 in AFRL-SA-WP-SR-2013-0003), but do not exceed those values
          in the upper tier MPE table (Table A.2.1. and Table 4 in AFRL-SA-WP-SR-2013-
          0003).
      3.1.1.2. Lower Tier (formerly, Uncontrolled Environment) MPEs. Lower Tier exposures
      can occur in areas where individuals would have no knowledge or control of their
      exposure. These locations include living quarters or workplaces where there are no
      expectations that the exposure levels may exceed those shown in the lower tier MPE table
      (Table A.2.2. and Table 5 in AFRL-SA-WP-SR-2013-0003).
      3.1.1.3. Action level. Any exposure in excess of those indicated in the lower tier MPE
      table (Table A.2.2. and Table 5 in AFRL-SA-WP-SR-2013-0003) requires the adoption
      of an EMF safety program. This will include training and posting requirements at a
      minimum. Where individuals unfamiliar with the phenomenon of induced EMF currents
      may have access, precautions shall be taken to limit induced currents to values not
      normally perceptible to individuals, as well as prevent the possibility of EMF burns. (T-
      0)
   3.1.2. Induced and Contact Current Standard. If the frequency range identified is 100 kHz to
   110 MHz, seek additional guidance from USAFSAM for induced and contact current hazard
   analysis. (T-2)
   3.1.3. The High Power Microwave (HPM) Upper Tier environment exposure limits are
   provided in Table A.2.1. for HPM and Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Simulator Systems.
   Contact USAFSAM for measurement and evaluation assistance at the ESOH Service Center
   at 1-888-232-3764, DSN 798-3764. (T-0)
   3.1.4. Commanders will avoid exposure of personnel to EMF levels in excess of the
   applicable MPE, except where necessary for medical treatment, or in training or operation of
   a DEW used in accordance with AFI 91-401, Directed Energy Weapons Safety. (T-0)
   3.1.5. For personnel with implanted medical devices, no specific exposure limits for
   implanted devices are specified. Certain environments such as an area with an arc welding
AFI48-109 1 AUGUST 2014                                                                      11


   process pose a potential hazard to these personnel due to potential EMI. These personnel
   shall consult with their physician(s) to determine how this potential exposure can affect the
   implanted medical device. (T-1)
3.2. Personal Protective Equipment Policies.
   3.2.1. EMF Protective Clothing. EMF shielded clothing is not authorized for use during Air
   Force operations. (T-0)
   3.2.2. EMF Sensors, Detectors, Alarms, Area Monitors, and Personal Warning Devices.
   AF/SG does not allow the use of personal detectors as a means of personal protection from
   EMF exposure in Air Force operational environments. In cases where the environment may
   exceed ten (10) times the MPE, special needs may be addressed and evaluated through
   consultation with USAFSAM. Use of these types of devices will require approval from
   AFMSA/SG3PB on advice of USAFSAM consultants. For area monitors, contact
   USAFSAM for approved monitors and guidelines for use. (T-0)
   3.2.3. EMF personal protective clothing such as insulated boots and gloves to protect against
   frequency dependent contact currents is authorized. All PPE must be inspected with each use
   and routinely tested to ensure protective efficacy, per manufacture’s guidelines. (T-0)
 12                                                                 AFI48-109 1 AUGUST 2014

                     INSTALLATION PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

4.1. General Guidelines. The requirements for the effective management of an installation
level EMF protection program are defined herein. Questions regarding the management or
implementation of an installation program requirement should be referred to USAFSAM.
Assistance with electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and EMI testing or the assessment of EMF
hazards to personnel, HERO and HERF (especially with regards to difficult to test transmitters
like rotating radars) must be referred to the 85 EIS/SCYM, 670 Maltby Hall Drive, Suite 234,
Keesler AFB, MS 39534-2633, (228) 377-3920 or DSN 597-3920.
4.2. EMF Hazard Evaluations.
   4.2.1. All EMF transmitters owned and operated by avionics workplaces, communications
   facilities, industrial processes, and medical facilities shall be identified during the regularly
   scheduled, on-site BE health risk assessment activities to these areas. Minimally, EMF
   emitters shall be inventoried biennially to identify new emitters, and evaluations shall be
   conducted if operations change or new systems are added to the inventory. Consultation with
   the Installation Frequency Manager shall be conducted to verify all emitters have been
   identified from these workplaces and potential additional work centers. (T-0)
   4.2.2. Commercially procured telecommunications systems designed for public use (e.g.
   cellular phones, Wi-Fi networks) that are used in their manufactured condition do not require
   evaluations. Devices intended to provide medical treatment do not require a special
   evaluation beyond manufacturer recommendations. (T-3)
   4.2.3. Inventories will be maintained for the EMF transmitters identified in Paragraph 4.2.1.
   BE should coordinate with the Weapons Safety Manager and Installation Spectrum Manager
   to ensure a complete base inventory. The inventories will include at a minimum the
   following categories: Work Center, Point of Contact (POC), POC Phone Number, Emitter
   Nomenclature (i.e. AN/GRT-21), Emitter Description (i.e. TACAN), Quantity, Frequency
   Range, Upper Tier and Lower Tier MPEs, and Hazard Distances. (T-0)
   4.2.4. The operational and maintenance environments, operational parameters, and exposure
   potential shall be evaluated against the applicable MPEs by BE to determine if exposures
   may be in excess of the standard. (T-2)
   4.2.5. Records of surveys, reports, calculations, and control measures imposed shall be
   maintained for each fielded EMF emitter which is capable of exceeding the MPEs in the
   lower tier MPE table (Table A.2.2. and Table 5 in AFRL-SA-WP-SR-2013-0003). (T-0)
4.3. EMF Hazards Control. Control measures may be recommended by BE following
thorough evaluation of the hazard potential, to include survey measurements. Follow the
hierarchy of controls IAW AFMAN 48-155, Occupational and Environmental Health Exposure
Controls, i.e., engineering controls followed by administrative controls. (T-0)
   4.3.1. Engineering Controls. Engineering controls are either inherent in the system or used
   in conjunction with its maintenance or operation to prevent potential overexposure or injury
   to the worker. (T-0)
AFI48-109 1 AUGUST 2014                                                                         13


   4.3.2. Administrative and Physical Controls. These controls are used primarily as exclusions
   to the EMF operational area by barrier or administrative procedures such as access restriction
   (e.g. elevation or fencing) and signage. These control measures should be used when
   engineering controls or other methods are not adequate. (T-0)
       4.3.2.1. Signage. Areas where the potential exists for EMF exposures to exceed
       exposure limits shall be clearly marked with appropriate signs. The signs shall be posted
       when engineering controls or other methods are not adequate. Signs may be used as a
       complement to other administrative controls. Signs will be multilingual when in
       locations where English is not the primary language and compliant with the requirements
       of the host nation. (T-0)
4.4. EMF Training Requirements.
   4.4.1. All personnel with the potential to exceed the Lower Tier MPEs (Table 5 in AFRL-
   SA-WP-SR-2013-0003) shall be provided initial and refresher training. BE will assist to
   develop this training and will include at a minimum the subject areas identified from the
   health risk assessment. Training guidance is found in AFRL-SA-WP-SR-2013-0003. The
   depth of information will be commensurate with the potential for exposure as well as the
   level of responsibility within the workplace EMF safety program. (T-0)
   4.4.2. The AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, authorized versions, or an
   equivalent computer-generated product that is a true, reproducible and historically accurate
   facsimile shall be used to record employee training. (T-0)
4.5. Medical Surveillance Requirements.
   4.5.1. Routine pre-placement, baseline, periodic, and termination occupational medical
   examinations are not required. (T-3)
   4.5.2. There are no special EMF exposure limits for pregnant females. Any EMF
   environment that is safe for the mother is also safe for the developing embryo or fetus. (T-3)
4.6. Incidents/Accidents Investigations. BE shall investigate and document all alleged
incidents involving personnel exposure that may exceed the MPEs in the upper tier MPE table
(Table A.2.1. and Table 4 in AFRL-SA-WP-SR-2013-0003), after including adjustments to the
MPE, such as spatial and time averaging, partial-body exposure, etc. The following immediate
actions must be taken whenever an overexposure is suspected or alleged to have occurred: (T-0)
   4.6.1. The individual will immediately report the incident to their supervisor. For personnel
   whose exposure(s) occurred at, or above, five times (5) the applicable MPE in the upper tier
   MPE table (Table A2.1. and Table 4 in AFRL-SA-WP-SR-2013-0003), a medical
   examination and recommendations for medical follow-up are mandatory within 72 hours of
   exposure. Individuals, who perceive they have symptoms from the exposure to EMF that are
   not at or above five (5) times the applicable MPE, may seek medical attention if they desire.
   The attending physician will consult with BE to confirm whether or not the individual was
   exposed to EMF five (5) times the applicable MPE and annotate this in the individual’s
   medical records. (T-0)
   4.6.2. The responsible area supervisor will stop operations and leave settings in place for the
   BE investigation unless operations are deemed mission critical. If the operation cannot be
   delayed for the investigation, the supervisor will record all settings necessary to recreate the
 14                                                               AFI48-109 1 AUGUST 2014


   incident for the BE investigation. The supervisor will notify BE upon initial report of the
   incident and will advise all other appropriate authorities within the unit according to unit
   reporting procedures. (T-0)
   4.6.3. BE will contact the DoD EMF Injury Hotline (ESOH Service Center) at 1-888-232-
   3764 or DSN 798-3764 and provide initial notification of the alleged incident to the
   MAJCOM BE and AFMSA/SG3PB. BE will conduct a preliminary investigation of the
   alleged incident and perform a reconstruction of the incident, to include field measurements
   if warranted. BE will notify PH and SEG of the alleged incident. (T-0)
   4.6.4. Public Health will initiate an occupation illness investigation per Paragraph 2.11.2.2,
   and Flight Medicine will conduct a post-exposure medical examination within 72 hours
   following the alleged overexposure for reported cases if the exposure exceeds five (5) times
   the MPE. (T-0)
   4.6.5. Final Report. Upon completion of the investigation and within 30 workdays, BE shall
   forward a detailed report to servicing AF PH, SEG, MAJCOM BE, and AFMSA/SG3PB
   with a courtesy copy to ESOH Service Center. BE shall complete the report in AFSAS. (T-
   1)
4.7. Additional Information: Additional information and guidelines concerning the
management of the installation EMF program can be found in AFRL-SA-WP-SR-2013-0003.

Terms
Action level—The values of the electric and magnetic field strength, the incident power density,
contact and induced current, and contact voltages above which actions shall be taken to protect
against exposures that exceed the lower tier, specifically, implementation of an EMF safety
program.
Action Level Environment—Locations where EMF exposures do not exceed the MPEs in
Table A.2.1. but do exceed those in Table A2.2 (i.e., the exposure range between the Upper and
Lower Tier environments).
Antenna—A device designed for radiating (or receiving) electromagnetic energy.
Diathermy—The medical application of EMF energy to produce heat within some part of the
human body for therapeutic purposes. Most diathermy equipment operates in the High
Frequency (HF) band.
Electro—Explosive Device (EED)—A pyrotechnic or explosive device designed to detonate
when an electric current passes through it, commonly called a squib.
Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)—Interference with the proper functioning of an electronic
device by electromagnetic means, internal or external.
Electromagnetic Radiation—The propagation of energy in the form of EM waves through
space. (Not intended to describe propagation along waveguides and other transmission lines).
Emitter—Any device which is designed to generate EMF energy and couple this energy into the
surrounding space.
Exposure, Partial Body—Partial-body exposure results when EMF are substantially non-
uniform over the body. Fields that are non-uniform over volumes comparable to the human body
occur due to highly directional sources, re-radiating sources, standing waves or when in the
antenna’s Near-Field region. For most antennas the far-field starts at twice the diameter of the
antenna divided by the wavelength.
Field Strength—The magnitude of the electric field (volts per meter) or magnetic field (amperes
per meter).
Frequency—The number of cycles completed by an electromagnetic wave in one second, given
in cycles per second (1/sec) or hertz.
Hertz (Hz)—The unit for expressing frequency. One hertz equals one cycle per second.
Commonly used multiples are kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz), and gigahertz (GHz).
Lower Tier—A set of limits that provide an additional margin of safety, i.e., a margin of safety
greater than that for the Upper Tier. See: action level.
 18                                                                AFI48-109 1 AUGUST 2014


Lower Tier Environments—Locations where EMF exposures do not exceed the MPEs in
Table A2.2 Such locations generally represent living quarters, workplaces, or public access
areas where personnel would not expect to encounter higher levels of EMF energy.
Magnetic Field Strength (H)—The magnitude of the magnetic field vector, expressed in units
of amperes per meter (A/m).
Microwaves—A term used to signify EMF waves from approximately 300 MHz upward.
Power—A physical quantity describing the rate of delivery or transmission of energy. In this
instruction, power referred to as radiofrequency power with units of watts (W).
Power Density (S)—Power per unit area normal to the direction of propagation, usually
expressed in watts per meter squared (W/m2) or, for hazard assessment, mW/cm2.
Response Time—The time required for a field-measuring instrument to reach some specified
percentage of the final value after being placed in the field to be measured. In this document, 90
percent of the final value is assumed.
Root—Mean-Square (rms)—The effective value, or the heating value, of a periodic EMF
wave. The rms value for E or H fields is obtained by taking the square root of the mean of the
squared values for E or H over an area equivalent to the vertical cross-section of the human body
(projected area).
Standing Wave—A spatially periodic or repeating field pattern of amplitude maxima and
minima that is generated by two equal-wavelength propagating waves traveling in different
directions. For any component of the field, the ratio of the amplitude at one point to that at any
other point does not vary with time.
Transmission Line—A system of conductors, such as wires, waveguides, or coaxial cables,
which conducts EMF energy between points in an EMF system.
Upper Tier—A set of EMF exposure limits that are scientifically based and that provide a
margin of safety for all, including those in an Upper Tier environment
Upper Tier Environment—Locations where EMF exposures may exceed the levels in Table
A2.1, but do not exceed the levels in Table A2.2. Generally, Upper Tier environments represent
areas that may be occupied by personnel who accept potential exposure as a concomitant of
employment or duties, by individuals who knowingly enter areas where such levels are to be
expected, or by personnel passing through such areas. Existing physical arrangements or areas,
such as fences, perimeters, or weather decks of a ship may be used in establishing Upper Tier
environments
Waveguide—An enclosed system capable of guiding electromagnetic waves from one place to
another. Usually consisting of a hollow metallic tube or a solid dielectric material.
Wavelength (λ)—The distance between two points having the same phase, in two consecutive
cycles of a periodic wave.

                MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE EXPOSURE (MPE) TABLES

A2.1. Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE).
   A2.1.1. MPE values have been based upon a whole-body specific absorption rate (SAR) of
   0.4 watts per kilogram (W/kg), and incorporate a safety factor of 10 or more below a SAR of
   4.0 W/kg, which is the conservative threshold for the occurrence of potentially deleterious
   health effects in humans. SAR as the basis is only applicable for 100 kHz – 3 GHz.
   A2.1.2. MPEs are expressed in terms of measurable field parameters as a convenient
   correlation to the SAR. These field parameters include root-mean-square (rms) electric field
   (E) and magnetic (H) field strengths, their squares, or the plane-wave equivalent power
   densities (S) associated with these fields, and peak electric field strengths. Induced and
   contact current limits that can be associated with exposures to such fields are also
   established.
       A2.1.2.1. Section A in Table A2.1 and Table A2.2, refer to time-averaged exposure
       values obtained by spatially averaging S, or the mean squared E and H values, over an
       area equivalent to the vertical cross-section of the human body (projected area). In the
       case of partial-body exposure or non-uniform fields, these MPEs, Table A2.1, may be
       exceeded. However the increased MPE must comply with the exposure limits listed in the
       additional sections of Table A2.1 and Table A2.2.
       A2.1.2.2. BE may contact USAFSAM for guidance when evaluating exposure incidents
       to determine if the MPE may be exceeded.
       A2.1.2.3. MPES are derived quantities that are based upon the basic restriction, i.e. the
       SAR.
   A2.1.3. Commanders will avoid exposure of personnel to EMF levels in excess of the
   applicable MPE, except where necessary for medical treatment, or in training or operation of
   a directed energy weapon used in accordance with AFI 91-401, or where mission
   requirements necessitate such exposure. (T-1)
A2.2. MPE Averaging Periods.
   A2.2.1. MPEs in Table A2.1 refer to values averaged over any 6-minute period for
   frequencies less than 15 GHz, and over shorter periods for higher frequencies (10 seconds at
   300 GHz). The MPEs in Table A2.2 refer to values generally averaged over any 6-minute or
   30-minute period for frequencies less than 3 GHz. For certain frequency intervals, the
   averaging period will vary as a function of frequency as shown in Table A2.1 and Table
   A2.2
   A2.2.2. For exposure duration less than the averaging period, the maximum permissible
   exposure level, is MPE [Tavg/Texp], where Texp is the exposure duration in that interval
   expressed in the same time units as Tavg.
A2.3. Upper Tier MPEs. The Upper Tier MPEs, Table A2.1, are given as a function of
frequency and are based on a SAR of 0.4 W/kg. These limits were developed to control human
exposures to electromagnetic energy at frequencies ranging from 0 kHz to 300 GHz, and to limit
 20                                                                 AFI48-109 1 AUGUST 2014


the localized SAR occurring in the feet, ankles, wrists, and hands of personnel due to exposure to
such fields or contact with objects exposed to such fields. MPEs are given in terms of rms
electric (E) and magnetic (H) field strengths, equivalent plane-wave free space power densities
(S), and induced currents (I) in the body.

   For exposures that are uniform over the dimensions of the body, such as certain far-field plane-
 wave exposures, the exposure field strengths and power densities are compared with the MPEs
 in section A of this table. For non-uniform exposures, the mean values of the exposure fields, as
 obtained by spatially averaging the squares of the field strengths or averaging the power
 densities over an area equivalent to the vertical cross section of the human body (projected
 area), or a smaller area depending on the frequency, are compared with the MPEs in section A
 of this table.

   These plane-wave equivalent power density values are commonly used as a convenient
 comparison with MPEs at higher frequencies and are displayed on some instruments in use.

  For exposures that are uniform over the dimensions of the body, such as certain far-field plane-
wave exposures, the exposure field strengths and power densities are compared with the MPEs in
section A of this table. For non-uniform exposures, the mean values of the exposure fields, as
obtained by spatially averaging the squares of the field strengths or averaging the power densities
over an area equivalent to the vertical cross section of the human body (projected area), or a smaller
area depending on the frequency, are compared with the MPEs in section A of this table.
c
  These plane-wave equivalent power density values are commonly used as a convenient comparison
with MPEs at higher frequencies and are displayed on some instruments in use.

A2.7. MPE for exposure of head and torso ( of Table A2 1 and Table A2.2). Section C lists
the MPE for the magnetic field (flux density, B, and magnetic field strength, H) for exposure of
the head and torso between 3 kHz and 5 MHz. For a rms measurement, the averaging time is 0.2
seconds.
A2.8. MPE for the limbs ( of Table A2 1 and Table A2.2). Section D describes the MPE for
the limbs (entire arms and legs). Measurements use an averaging time of 0.2 seconds.
Compliance with this MPE ensures compliance with the basic restrictions (BRs) for various parts
of the body (Table A2.1 and 3.2 G and, paragraph A2.10). However, lack of compliance with
this section does not necessarily indicate lack of compliance with the basic restrictions. In the
event of this condition, further evaluation may be required to ensure that compliance is met. (T-
0)
A2.9. Induced and contact current ( of Table A2.1 and Table A2.2).If the frequency range
identified falls between 100 kHz to 110 MHz, seek additional guidance from usafsam for
induced and contact current hazards. (T-1)
A2.10. Basic Restrictions (BRs) applying to various regions of the body ( of Table
A2.1 and Table A2.2). For frequencies from 3 kHz to 5 MHz, the BRs refer to limits on the in
situ electric fields. This will minimize adverse health effects associated with electro-stimulation
to human exposure to electromagnetic energy on various parts of the body.
A2.11. BRs for frequencies between 100 kHz and 3 GHz ( of Table A2.1 and Table A.2.2).
BR for the frequency range of 100 kHz to 3 GHz is established to avoid adverse health effects
from tissue heating. The SAR of 0.4 W/kg averaged over the whole body incorporates a safety
factor of 10 for Upper Tier environments and a higher safety factor for Lower Tier environments
to ensure safety for the general population.
A2.12. Relaxation of the power density MPEs (partial-body exposures) ( of Table
A2.1 and Table A2.2).
   A2.12.1. Implicit in the MPE definition of a whole-body averaged SAR of 0.4 W/kg for an
   Upper Tier environment and 0.08 W/kg for a Lower Tier environment, is the assumption that
   spatial peak SARs may occur that exceed the whole body averaged values by a factor of
   more than 20 times. The values provided in of Table A2.1 and Table A2.2 allow for
   equating substantially non-uniform field exposure or partial-body exposure to an equivalent
   uniform field exposure. BE should consider the values given for partial body exposures when
   the exposure exceeds the MPEs given in Table A2.1 or Table A2.2, and the exposure was
   limited to a specific part of the body, or the field was not uniformly distributed over the
   whole body of the individual exposed.
   A2.12.2. For exposure of parts of the body, the spatially averaged MPEs given in of Table
   A2.1 and Table A2.2 may be relaxed provided the peak value of the mean squared field
   strength (E and H Fields) does not exceed 20 times the square of the allowed spatially
   averaged values at frequencies below 300 MHz, or the equivalent S levels do not exceed the
   levels shown in of Table A2.1 and Table A2.2 as averaged over the Tavg periods given for
   frequencies above 300 MHz. Those rules for relaxation of the limits for partial-body
   exposure do not apply for exposures to the eyes. The SAR exclusion rules in paragraph
   A.2.13.1 can still be used to show conformance to the MPE, despite localized S values above
   the specified whole-body average. In such cases, exposures to the eyes are limited by the
AFI48-109 1 AUGUST 2014                                                                       27


   basic exposure criteria of a whole-body averaged SAR of 0.4 W/kg (Upper Tier
   environment) or 0.08 W/kg (Lower Tier environment), and spatial peak SARs of 8 W/kg
   (Upper Tier environment) or 1.6 W/kg (Lower Tier environment) as averaged over any one
   gram of tissue. (T-0)
A2.13. Pulsed Peak Field Limits ( of Table A2.1 and Table A2.2).
   A2.13.1. Peak power exposure limitations are provided for pulses in the frequency range of
   0.1 to 300,000 MHz, where each pulse is less than 100 milliseconds (msec) and there are no
   more than five (5) pulses in the time averaging period. Those limits are given to prevent
   unintentionally high exposure and to preclude high specific absorption for decreasingly short
   widths of pulses. If there are more than five (5) pulses during any time period equal to the
   averaging time, or if the pulse durations are greater than 100 msec, the time-averaged S
   should not exceed the MPEs given in of Table A2.1 and Table A2.2
   A2.13.2. For exposure to EMF pulses in the frequency range of 0.1 to 300,000 MHz,
   exposure is limited by either a peak (temporal) E field of 100 kV/m for each pulse or in terms
   of a peak power density value (S) for each single pulse, whichever is more limiting. For high
   frequencies and longer pulses, peak S will be more conservative.
   A2.13.3. The limitation on EMF fields under pulsed conditions, (less than 100 msec), means
   that the MPE as averaged over any 100 msec is reduced by a factor of five (5), and a
   maximum of five (5) such pulses is permitted during any period equal to the averaging time.
   For example, in the microwave region for exposure to a single pulse, the specific absorption
   over any 6-minute period is limited to 28.8 J/kg per pulse (spatial average) with a maximum
   of five (5) such pulses (i.e., (5)(28.8 J/kg) = 144 J/kg), which is equivalent to a SAR of 0.4
   W/kg over a 6-minute period).
A2.14. MPEs and Exposure Guidance for High Power Microwave (HPM) and
Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Simulators.
   A2.14.1. HPM Systems. For exposures in Upper Tier environments involving HPM narrow-
   band systems, the exposure limit for any single pulse or series of pulses lasting less than 10
   seconds is provided in Table A2.3. For Lower Tier environments, exposures shall conform to
   the MPEs in Table A2.2. (T-0)
   A2.14.2. The exposure guidance given below in Table A2.3 is based on HPM narrow-band
   systems operating within the following parameters: maximum pulse width of 10
   microseconds, peak S of 0.1 to 10 kW/cm2, frequency greater than 100 MHz, repetition rate
   not greater than 10 pulses per second.
   A2.14.3. The exposure guidance is specific for HPM narrow-band systems and does not
   apply to exposure from EMP broad-band simulator systems. If the HPM system is not within
   those parameters, then the MPEs in Table A2.1 apply. (T-0)
   A2.14.4. For personnel exposure to HPM in an Upper Tier environment, the measured
   fluence is not to exceed the values given in of Table A2.3 for any single pulse or series of
   multiple pulses lasting less than 10 seconds. The total fluence delivered over any 6-minute
   period shall not exceed the values in of Table A2.3. In all cases, the instantaneous E field
   shall not exceed 200 kV/m. (T-0)

   A2.14.5. If the exposure values given in of Table A2.3 cannot be met, then the total
   measured SA to the head shall not exceed 150 J/kg for any single pulse or 150 J/kg for
   multiple pulses in any 6-minute period. (T-0)
   A2.14.6. EMP Simulator Systems. For exposure in Upper Tier environments involving
   broad-band EMP simulators, the exposure limit is given in of Table A2.3. Measurements of
   EM Fields from broad-band EMP simulator systems require special instrumentation and
   techniques because of the inherent rapid rise time and the high field strengths associated with
   EMP. Contact USAFSAM for measurement and evaluation assistance. (T-1)
