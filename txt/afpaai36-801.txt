1. Background. Telework is a work flexibility arrangement where workers perform all or part
of their duty assignments at approved worksites away from the traditional office facility. It is
both an instrument of organizational business strategy and a work/life balance enabler for
personnel, involving all members of the organization regardless of their telework status.
Realizing true benefits from telework requires a commitment to establishing a viable program
 2                                                                  AFPAAI36-801 3 JULY 2013


with measurable goals, such as: improving the work/life balance of people, improving retention
and recruitment, making more effective use of office space and facilities, limiting unproductive
time during area emergency situations or crisis, reducing the environmental impacts of
commuting. Work flexibility arrangements help to maintain a productive workforce and
contribute to the accomplishment of our mission and service to the American taxpayer.
2. Guidance. The AFPAA Telework Program requires that:
     2.1. AFPAA organizations establish internal guidance and procedures to maximize
     appropriate use of telework as a work flexibility arrangement, to include integrating telework
     into Continuity of Operations Plan strategy, as well as continuity of business strategy during
     emergency events such as pandemic or adverse weather. Telework should be periodically
     exercised to ensure its effectiveness in continuing operations.
        2.1.1. When Federal facilities are “CLOSED to the Public,” telework-ready workers not
        on an Alternate Work Schedule (AWS) day and those scheduled to telework are generally
        expected to start the workday in a telework status. Should circumstances such as loss of
        power, loss of internet service, childcare, etc., cause the worker to not meet all conditions
        of being telework-ready, then the worker may be excused from the work expectation as
        long as the circumstance(s) exists.
        2.1.2. When Federal facilities are “OPEN” on a scheduled telework day, teleworkers are
        expected to start the workday in a telework status or request unscheduled leave.
        2.1.3. When Federal facilities are “OPEN” on an unscheduled telework day and a
        Delayed Arrival or Early Departure announcement is made, telework-ready workers may
        have the additional flexibility of either requesting unscheduled leave or
        starting/continuing the workday (as applicable) in an unscheduled telework status.
     2.2. Unless the nature of the job or poor performance prohibits it, every individual should be
     eligible for telework, whether on a full-time, regular, or situational basis, and should be made
     telework-ready. While telework is not a worker entitlement, every individual eligible for
     telework should be afforded the opportunity. Eligibility in this context applies to Department
     of Air Force civilian employees, United States Air Force military members, and contract
     employees (when the contract so stipulates).
        2.2.1. Eligibility criteria as established in DoD Instruction 1035.01, Telework Policy,
        Enclosure 3, paragraph 2 applies.
        2.2.2. The standard agreement for Air Force civilian employees will be the DD Form
        2946, DoD Telework Agreement.
        2.2.3. United States Air Force military members are not required, but are encouraged, to
        have a telework agreement on file using DD Form 2946.
        2.2.4. Telework by contractors will be in accordance with their respective contracts. The
        contracting officer technical advisor, quality assurance, or Program Manager must
        contact the contracting officer and their organization’s Telework Manager prior to any
        discussion of telework with a contracted employee.
     2.3. Telework and AWS are different work flexibility arrangements, but are not mutually
     exclusive.
AFPAAI36-801 3 JULY 2013                                                                      3


   2.4. Any additional hardware or software supporting telework beyond that which is covered
   by AFPAA Enterprise Service must be approved by AFPAA/DS and the local
   communications squadron/group and funded by the individual organization.
   2.5. Telework, as an alternative workplace arrangement, will be considered in office/facility
   space utilization as a means to make effective use of space and provide flexibility to
   accommodate future space requirements and challenges.

SUBJECT: Notification to Employee on Telework Eligibility

1. Your eligibility for telework is as follows:
    Yes (See #3)
         Emergency situation telework:         Telework performed in an employee’s home or
               alternative worksite during a crisis situation or emergency event by those
               employees who perform duties in support of mission requirements during crisis
               situations or contingencies.
            Situational telework:   Telework that occurs on an occasional non-routine or ad
               hoc basis. Telework that occurs to complete short-term special assignments or to
               accommodate special circumstances is also considered situational even though the
               telework may occur continuously for a specific period.

            Unscheduled telework:    A specific form of situational telework where an
               employee on an approved telework agreement performs assigned official duties at
               home or other approved worksite when Government offices are closed because of
               an emergency event or open, but severe weather conditions or other circumstances
               disrupt commuting and compromise employee safety.

            Routine telework:     Telework in which telework occurs as part of an ongoing,
               regular schedule

    No (See #2)

2.   You are not eligible to telework due to the following restriction(s):
      Your position requires, on a daily basis, direct handling of classified materials.
      Your position requires, on a daily basis, an on-site activity, use of specialized equipment
        or face-to-face personal contacts that cannot be handled remotely or at an alternative
        worksite.
      You have been officially disciplined for being absent without permission for more than 5
        days in any calendar year.
      You have been officially disciplined for violations of subpart G of the Standards of
        Ethical Conduct of Employees of the Executive Branch for reviewing, downloading, or
        exchanging pornography, including child pornography, on a Federal Government
        computer or while performing official Federal Government duties [Public Law 111-292,
        6502(a)(2)(A)(B)].
      You were recently assigned or newly appointed to a trainee or entry-level position.
      Your performance or conduct warrant more close supervisory direction than telework
        may provide.
      Your rating of record is below fully successful (or its equivalent).

   default setting but not the Encrypt contents and attachments of all outgoing messages. If you
   need to send sensitive data that requires the use of encryption, you will be able to select the
   e-mail encryption icon on the menu of new, reply to, reply to all or forward e-mail messages
   (     ). Only select this option when required by the content of your outgoing e-mail
   messages. (Note: Be sure to click Save (            ) after you make any option menu changes.)
   Note: After the installation, if the Choose a digital certificate window pops up, you may
   notice that not all certificates are available to you when asked. My E-mail certificate was not
   available to me after my installation. You can open ActivIdentyActiveClientUser Console to
   open ActivClient and select ToolsAdvancedMake Certificates Available to Windows. A
   better option would be to restart your computer after the S/MIME control installation.
