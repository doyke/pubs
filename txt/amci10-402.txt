This instruction establishes policies and procedures for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). The
CRAF program is a national plan, based on the Defense Production Act of 1950 and Executive
Order 12656, to utilize airlift resources of US air carriers to support Department of Defense
(DOD) airlift requirements in a national security situation. This instruction implements AFPD
10-4, Operations Planning: Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF), to establish procedures
for peacetime planning for the activation of the CRAF. It provides guidance for Air Force
organizations involved in DOD civil augmentation airlift and for civil air carriers participating in
the CRAF. Along with the International, Alaska, and Domestic CRAF Airlift Services contract,
Public Law 85-804 and Executive Order 10789, as amended, these documents constitute the Air
Mobility Command (AMC) guidance for the use of CRAF resources. This publication applies to

                                      CRAF GENERAL

Section 2A—Policies

2.1. Basic Policies. Basic policies for the CRAF program are directed toward identification,
organization, and development of readily available civil aircraft that are capable of augmenting
the airlift capability of the DOD. The CRAF may be activated/deactivated incrementally or in
total, by stage, segment, section, and elements. The government retains the option of activating
any portion of each stage or segment, as required. During CRAF activation, AMC exercises
tactical control and the carrier retains operations control. References to HQ AMC/A3BC imply
the HQ AMC, DOD Commercial Airlift Division, CRAF Branch.
   2.1.1. CRAF Operational Risk Policy. CRAF aircraft augment DOD’s organic airlift
   capacity; they are not a replacement for military assets nor will they be tasked to assume the
   same level of operational risk. The reasons for this policy are based on the vulnerability of
   civil aircraft and crews to both conventional and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear,
   and high-yield explosive (CBRNE) threats. Unlike their military counterparts, civilian
   aircraft are not reinforced with protective armor for aircrew protection against conventional
   munitions, nor are the crews trained in departure/arrival threat avoidance procedures.
   Further, civil aircrews are not trained to fly in the protective equipment needed to fly in
   CBRNE environments, nor are they provided this equipment for use in the air (commercial
   aircraft are also not modified to connect communications and oxygen systems to the aircrew
   chemical defense ensemble).
   2.1.2. Lack of an internationally accepted standard for aircraft decontamination (i.e.,
   cleanliness) means loss of any CBRNE-contaminated aircraft; no country would likely
   permit such a craft to enter its airspace. The second order effects of an aircraft loss (whether
   due to conventional or CBRNE threats) would be reduced future participation in the CRAF
   program. Therefore, CRAF will not operate in a chemical biological contaminated
   environment.
   2.1.3. In the event an unforeseen CBRNE attack occurs during a transit stop, AMC will issue
   ground chemical defense ground ensembles and masks to CRAF carrier personnel for
   personal protection. Every effort will be made to divert arriving CRAF aircraft and if
   possible, launch aircraft on the ground to prevent contamination. Upon warning of
   impending CBRNE attack (and it is impossible to launch civil aircraft), civilian
   crewmembers will don ground ensembles and take shelter, as directed by local authorities.
       2.1.3.1. Should a CRAF aircraft become contaminated, it will be removed from the
       airflow until clearance decontamination can be accomplished. However, even if
       decontaminated to negligible levels, such assets will not be allowed to be used for flight.
       2.1.3.2. Generally, CRAF aircraft will not be used to transport equipment with residual
       contamination, due to safety and legal concerns. Further information regarding joint
       operations under CBRNE threat conditions is available in JP 3-11, Joint Doctrine for
       Operations in Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Environments.

   2.1.4. While activated, CRAF activated aircraft will comply with A3-approved threat
   mitigation policies for commercial aircraft published by the AMC Threat Working Group in
   the AMC policy matrix. Waivers to policies may be granted by the 18 AF/CC on a case-by-
   case basis IAW procedures outlined in AMCI 14-106, Threat Working Group. During pre-
   mission briefing, intelligence personnel will provide appropriately cleared CRAF crews
   access to applicable country and airfield risk assessments.
2.2. Composition of the Fleet. The CRAF is composed of U.S. registered civil transport
aircraft that are suitable and operationally capable of performing airlift for the DOD. The
number and type of aircraft are identified to satisfy long-range international, short-range
international, aeromedical evacuation (AE), domestic, and Alaskan airlift requirements.
Principal considerations in determining aircraft suitability are range, payload, block speed, and
configuration. In addition, a minimum flight deck crew to aircraft ratio is required for
acceptance into the CRAF. The long-range international, short-range international, and (AE)
segments require a minimum 4:1 ratio. (The domestic and Alaskan sections of the national
segment requires only sufficient cockpit crew manning to finish each mission without aircrew
delays.) Flight deck crewmembers counted in this ratio must be U.S. citizens, free from military
Reserve and National Guard obligations, and be eligible for a U.S. SECRET clearance, in
accordance with Defense Security Service (DSS) guidelines.) Numbers of committed aircraft
can be found in AMC HQ Form 312, CRAF Capability Summary, maintained and published by
HQ AMC/A3BC (hereafter referred to as ―A3BC‖).
2.3. Contractual Basis. The international, Alaska, and domestic CRAF contracts facilitate
CRAF participation and incorporate all the contractual provisions necessary for its operation.
These contracts establish the contracting carriers' legal obligations to perform and are the basis
for payment for all services rendered. Note: If there are any contractual conflicts between this
instruction and any AMC airlift services contracts, which supports the CRAF, the contract takes
precedence. The following paragraphs are for reference only taken from FY09 contracting
figures. The latest information can be obtained from USTRANSCOM/AQ-C (TCAQ) or
AMC/A3BC.

2.4. Use of the Fleet. Use of CRAF resources will be based on military operational plans, terms
and considerations of this instruction, and provisions of each carrier's AMC airlift services
contract. CRAF Activation can disrupt the nation’s domestic air service and, as such, is
monitored by the Department of Transportation (DOT).
2.5. Aircraft Operations. CRAF aircraft supporting DOD airlift requirements during a CRAF
activation will be operated in accordance with appropriate Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs)
and such waivers, deviations, or exemptions as applicable.
2.6. Aircraft Maintenance. Maintenance of CRAF aircraft is the responsibility of the operating
carrier and will be performed in accordance with appropriate FARs and such waivers, deviations,
or exemptions where applicable.
2.7. Logistics Support. CRAF logistics support will be coordinated with the AMC Crisis
Action Team (CAT) and will be monitored by TCAQ (Contract Airlift Office) and CRAF Cell
(see paragraph 3.5.1).
   2.7.1. Use of Existing Carrier Assets. To the maximum extent possible, logistics support
   of CRAF aircraft will be provided by the participating carrier and obtained from existing
   carrier assets. Shortages in such support may be supplemented by carrier contract and/or
   arrangements with other sources. If CRAF carriers cannot support themselves, requests for
   assistance should be forwarded to CRAF Cell.
   2.7.2. Use    of     Government-furnished        Material   Handling        Equipment
   (MHE). Government-furnished MHE will be used at military onload/offload airfields
   whenever possible. Upon TCAQ approval, augmenting commercial resources may be
   acquired under the Changes clause of the Airlift Services contract in situations where
   government-furnished MHE is unavailable or inadequate.
   2.7.3. Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL). Upon activation, CRAF carriers may
   purchase POL products at military airfields and/or civil airports in accordance with directives
   identified in Chapter 7. Prior to CRAF activation and when possible, USTRANSCOM Joint
   Petroleum Office (JPO), in conjunction with HQ AMC/A4, will coordinate with 618 TACC
   to determine POL requirements and will forward these to the Defense Energy Support Center
   (DESC). HQ AMC/A4RP will coordinate with USTRANSCOM/JPO, AMC staff agencies,
   and DESC as required.
   2.7.4. Reimbursable or Equitable Exchange. Logistics support, other than that listed in
   the Airlift Services contract, will be furnished at military airfields, if available, on a
   reimbursable or equitable exchange basis.
   2.7.5. Government-Furnished Cargo Equipment. Cargo tie-down equipment will be
   furnished by military customers being moved in accordance with paragraph 6.6 of this
   instruction.
   2.7.6. Prestocking War Readiness Material (WRM). Programming, budgeting, funding,
   procuring, and prestocking WRM is normally unauthorized for specific support of the CRAF
   (see paragraph 2.7.3).
   2.7.7. Airframe and Engine Spares. Support for airframe and engine spares will be
   obtained from existing airline industry resources (in accordance with 2.7.1 above).

2.8. Manpower. All personnel required in the performance of CRAF operations at civil airports
shall be furnished by the CRAF carriers. (EXCEPTION: Passenger service agents shall be
furnished by AMC at onload and offload sites, to marshal passengers aboard the aircraft and
provide the aircraft captain with a manifest that includes actual weights of passengers and cargo.)
   2.8.1. CRAF Loading Supervisors. During CRAF activation, carriers may be required to
   provide highly qualified and certified loading supervisory personnel to report where directed
   by HQ AMC/A3B. Any decision to position key personnel will be designed to facilitate
   enhanced airlift movement.
   2.8.2. Reserve or National Guard Forces Commitment. For planning purposes, carrier
   personnel who have a military Reserve or National Guard commitment will not be
   considered as part of the 4:1 flight deck crew required for acceptance into CRAF. However,
   during CRAF activation, such personnel may be used in CRAF carrier work until such time
   as their military units have alerted them for recall to active duty.
   2.8.3. U.S. National vs. Indigenous Personnel. During CRAF activation, all flight deck
   crewmembers must be U.S. citizens eligible for a SECRET clearance. In foreign countries,
   indigenous personnel determined not to be a threat to U.S. assets may be used to fulfill other
   personnel requirements.
2.9. Use of Civil Airfields. CRAF aircraft will use AMC Threat Working Group-approved en
route civil airfields whenever possible, to reduce saturation at military airfields.
2.10. Leased Aircraft. In accordance with National Security Decision Directive #280, National
Airlift Policy 24 July 1989, airlift procurement through the CRAF program will be suitable and
responsive to military requirements. As such, aircraft, which are wet-leased to another carrier
without a retrieval clause, are not considered eligible for CRAF participation. Aircraft, which
are dry-leased, either to U.S. carriers with whom AMC cannot execute a CRAF contract or to
foreign carriers not approved by the Commander U.S. Transportation Command (TCCC), are not
considered eligible for CRAF participation.

Section 2B—Concepts

2.11. Aircraft Allocation.
   2.11.1. HQ AMC/A3B (hereafter referred to as A3B) determines aircraft suitability prior to
   submitting allocation requests to the Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and
   Special Programs Administration, Office of Emergency Transportation (OET). The Director,
   OET, allocates U.S. registered civil aircraft to the CRAF by the assigned FAA registration
   number, in accordance with the Defense Production Act (DPA). Issues regarding the DOT
   allocation of CRAF aircraft or DOD requirement for CRAF aircraft, should be presented to
   the Director, OET, for review and resolution (CDRL 003).
   2.11.2. Allocation Determination.
       2.11.2.1. Long- and short-range international and AE CRAF aircraft are allocated by
       OET to satisfy DOD wartime airlift requirements, as identified by Joint Chiefs of Staff
       (JCS), the combatant commanders, and major commands.
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                     15


       2.11.2.2. Domestic and Alaskan CRAF aircraft are allocated by OET to satisfy increased
       DOD airlift requirements in the CONUS and Alaskan theater during a declared national
       emergency.
2.12. Carrier Aircraft Status Reporting.
   2.12.1. CRAF carriers are required to report to TCAQ when a CRAF-allocated aircraft is:
       2.12.1.1. Destroyed or suffers major damage.
       2.12.1.2. Sold or leased, to include the identity of the transferee, date and place of
       transfer, and the terms and conditions of the transfer.
       2.12.1.3. Registered under a different number or removed from U.S. registration.
       2.12.1.4. Otherwise unable to satisfy its CRAF commitment (e.g., seizure by a foreign
       government, returned to lessor, repossessed by lien holder, undergoing major
       refurbishment/repairs, etc.)
2.13. Definitions.
   2.13.1. CRAF: Voluntary DOD program in which civilian air carriers annually contract to
   provide the DOD emergency surge airlift in exchange for entitlement to routine DOD
   business (troop charters, cargo missions, etc.). CRAF carriers must be a U.S. entity or citizen
   owning U.S. registered aircraft that are certificated under FAA FAR Part 121 rules. These
   aircraft are allocated by DOT in accordance with DOD requirements and aircraft capabilities
   into segments, such as international (long-range, short-range, cargo, and passenger), national
   (domestic and Alaskan), and AE, and other segments as mutually agreed upon by the DOD
   and the DOT.
   2.13.2. CRAF Activation: The formal act of notifying CRAF carriers that a CRAF stage,
   segment, section, and/or element, or any portions thereof, are activated and operational.
   TCCC, with the approval of the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), can activate any of the
   three stages of the CRAF. Per MOU, DOT concurrence is required for allocation of aircraft
   for CRAF Stage III activation. CRAF aircraft may be used up to the full numbers composing
   whichever stage has been approved by the SECDEF.
   2.13.3. CRAF Deactivation: The formal act of notifying CRAF carriers that a CRAF stage,
   segment, section, and/or element, or any portions thereof, are deactivated and no longer
   operational. Per contract, AMC must give carriers 15 days prior notice before deactivating
   their aircraft. Also, AMC shall provide a minimum 5-calendar day notice for subsequent
   call-up of those aircraft released.
   2.13.4. Aircraft Call-up: After a stage, segment, section, and/or element of CRAF is
   activated, the formal act of notifying a CRAF carrier that certain aircraft are required to meet
   DOD airlift requirements in response to a CRAF activation. Aircraft called up shall be given
   specific directions on where to relocate and scheduled departure times. Aircraft should be
   called up by registration number. Substitute aircraft of equal capability may be provided
   when acceptable to A3BC and approved by the contracting officer.
   2.13.5. CRAF Stage: A portion of CRAF that may be activated for use in meeting JCS
   airlift requirements in support of U.S. military involvement in worldwide contingencies.
 16                                                       AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011


   2.13.6. CRAF Segments: The largest units within CRAF. There are three CRAF Segments:
   International (Long-range and Short-range), AE, and National (Domestic and Alaska).
   2.13.7. CRAF Section: The International and National Segments are organized further by
   section. The sections for the International Segment are Long-range and Short-range. The
   sections for the National Segment include Domestic and Alaskan.
   2.13.8. CRAF Element: As part of a section, a CRAF element is identified as either
   passenger or cargo service.
   2.13.9. Notification: Officially notifying CRAF carriers or AMC of an impending, or actual
   CRAF-related activity. Notification is considered acceptable if received by either party by
   telephone followed in writing, or by electronic message or facsimile, or via Aeronautical
   Radio, Inc., (ARINC).
   2.13.10. Aircraft response time for A3BC planning and exercise purposes is the elapsed time
   from carrier notification of CRAF activation until the carrier offers the aircraft to TCAQ for
   mission assignment. Response time for AE aircraft ends when the aircraft arrives in baseline
   configuration for shipset installation.
   2.13.11. Intermediate Staging Base (ISB): Commercial carrier stop added for servicing,
   providing support, and/or equipment prior to flying into an area of responsibility (AOR).
   Historical note: Rome, Italy, was used in a 2003 activation. Location can be either a
   commercial or military airfield, but is generally a location familiar with handling of
   commercial aircraft.
   2.13.12. Enabling Concept: Optional force module used to provide military support to an
   ISB includes: Intel, supply, and civil engineering war readiness support. See Chapter 4 for
   further details.
2.14. CRAF Activation/Deactivation Process.
   2.14.1. The CRAF may be activated or deactivated either incrementally or in total, by stage,
   and separately by segments, section, and element. CRAF may be activated in one of the
   following ways:
       2.14.1.1. The President, SECDEF, or TCCC directs CRAF activation. The message to
       activate is passed from TCCC, to AMC/CC to HQ AMC/A3 to A3B. Warning message
       is passed from AMC/CC to 18 AF/CC to 618 TACC/CC.
       2.14.1.2. AMC/CC and/or 618 TACC/CC are queried concerning the need to activate for
       a given situation. A3, 18 AF, TACC, and USTRANSCOM determine level of Mobility
       Air Forces utilization versus anticipated requirements. TCCC then determines if request
       for activation is warranted.
       2.14.1.3. 618 TACC or HQ AMC/A3 sees need for activation and forwards request to
       TCCC via appropriate command channels.
2.15. Aircraft Call-up/Release. Within each activated stage, segment, section, and element,
AMC may select and call up specific aircraft needed to fulfill the DOD airlift requirement.
AMC may elect to call up only a portion of the available aircraft and is not obligated to call up
aircraft from every carrier. Aircraft selection will be prorated based on operational airlift
requirements and the MV of each carrier compared to the total CRAF MV. Aircraft should be
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                         17


called up by FAA registration number. If committed aircraft are not designated for call up
within 72 hours after CRAF activation, the aircraft shall be released and the contractor shall
receive a minimum of 5 days notice of any subsequent call up, unless a higher stage of CRAF is
mandated by DOD contingency requirements. If DOD contingency requirements mandate
activation at a higher stage (i.e., Stage II or III), the 5-day minimum notification requirement is
nullified and the appropriate response time to the newly activated stage shall apply.
2.16. Aircraft Substitution during CRAF Activation. Carriers may substitute aircraft of equal
capability for aircraft being called up. Such aircraft substitutions must be acceptable to the
CRAF Cell and the AMC Crisis Action Team (CAT) and be approved by the contracting officer.
Substitution after CRAF mission planning commences must be kept to a minimum to avoid
conflicts, such as pallet contour issues and overflight and/or landing clearances.
2.17. Volunteer Carriers. Carriers may volunteer to perform missions prior to and during
CRAF activation.
   2.17.1. When existing volunteer capacity does not meet forecast mission requirements,
   TCAQ will initiate through A3B a request for additional volunteerism. Historically HQ
   AMC/A3 has held teleconferences with carrier MOBREPs to specify additional mission
   requirements. Prior to this call, TCAQ and A3B will determine the likely type of aircraft and
   carriers whose unused capacity would meet DOD mission needs.
   2.17.2. Volunteers supporting contingency requirements prior to CRAF activation, time
   permitting, will be given the option for their aircraft to be considered for call-up first. This
   applies when the CRAF stage and the segment in which their aircraft would normally qualify
   is activated, but only to the level of aircraft required. If the carrier desires, these aircraft may
   be considered called up first and released last. After volunteers have committed to activation
   and been called up, additional aircraft, if required, shall be determined and prorated based on
   MV of aircraft within the segment and section activated.
2.18. Aircraft Call-up and Response Time.
   2.18.1. International contracts: When the CRAF is activated, response times for carriers
   shall be 24 hours after aircraft call-up and mission assignment for Stages I and II and 48
   hours for aircraft call-up for Stage III. In those cases where all the aircraft in the stage are
   not called up, written notification of release from the 24- or 48-hour response requirement
   will be given within 72 hours of the activation of the CRAF.
   2.18.2. Domestic contracts: Upon activation of Stages II or III of the CRAF, aircraft
   requested by the Government must be positioned where directed by the Government, with
   maximum fuel aboard consistent with aircraft performance limitations and mission
   requirements, as quickly as possible, but in no event more than 24 hours for Stage II and 48
   hours for Stage III, after the contractor receives mission assignment.
   2.18.3. AE Segment: Response time for AE aircraft ends when the aircraft arrives in
   baseline configuration for the shipset installation. When the AE Segment is activated for
   Stages II or III, carriers shall, upon notification of aircraft call-up, have 48 hours to
   reconfigure aircraft in baseline status and deliver to the Aeromedical Evacuation Shipsets
   (AESS) contractor for aeromedical conversion. When required, subsequent delivery of two
   aircraft every 24 hours thereafter, for conversion, until the requirement is met or the carrier
   commitment is exhausted (see Chapter 13, paragraph 13.2.1).
 18                                                        AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011


2.19. Minimum Utilization of Long-Range International Aircraft. Carriers with long-range
international aircraft called up for CRAF service will be guaranteed an average utilization of 8
hours per day per aircraft (13 hours per day for AE) called up for the duration of the call-up or
for a minimum of 30 days, whichever is longer. Only aircraft called-up are guaranteed minimum
utilization. AMC shall give at least 15 days notice of release of an aircraft called up or
deactivation of any part of CRAF. Negotiation of compensation for underutilization shall be in
accordance with the procedures outlined in the AMC airlift services contract.
2.20. CRAF Stages. TCCC, with the approval of the SECDEF, or the Secretary's designee,
may activate any stage of CRAF when expanded civil augmentation of military airlift activity is
required. Once activation is approved, TCCC may activate and deactivate the segments,
sections, or elements within the activated stage, as required.
   2.20.1. Stage I - Committed Expansion. This stage is activated to support substantially
   expanded peacetime military requirements or a minor regional contingency when AMC
   organic airlift capability cannot meet both deployment and other airlift requirements
   simultaneously. It is comprised of long-range assets only.
   2.20.2. Stage II - Defense Airlift Emergency. This stage is activated to support a defense
   airlift emergency. It responds to requirements greater than Stage I, but less than full national
   emergency. This airlift expansion is identified for response to one major theater war. It is
   comprised of all three segments--International, National, and AE.
   2.20.3. Stage III - National Emergency. This stage is activated to support a declared national
   defense-oriented emergency or war, or when otherwise necessary for national defense. This
   is airlift expansion involving total CRAF airlift capability, made available for airlift
   emergencies involving DOD operations in the following situations:
       2.20.3.1. During multiple major theater wars, during a defense-oriented national
       emergency declared by the President, or in time of a national emergency declared by
       Congress.
       2.20.3.2. In a national security situation short of a declared defense-oriented national
       emergency.
       2.20.3.3. Activation of CRAF Stage III presumes that the Secretary of Transportation has
       been authorized to exercise presidential priorities and allocation authority.
2.21. Planning Considerations.
   2.21.1. Unless otherwise specified in applicable tasking messages, planning for the use of
   CRAF will be predicated upon the following:
       2.21.1.1. Availability, upon 24-hour notice, of those passenger and cargo aircraft
       identified as Stages I and II resources, to perform airlift services as required by the
       Government.
       2.21.1.2. Availability, upon 48-hour notice, of passenger and cargo aircraft identified as
       Stage III resources.
       2.21.1.3. Availability, upon 48-hour notice, of passenger aircraft designated to operate as
       AE aircraft for delivery to the AESS installation contractor for conversion from the
       passenger configuration to the AE configuration.
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  19


       2.21.1.4. Use of carrier resources to the maximum extent possible.
   2.21.2. In the event of a national emergency, the Defense Production Act provides for
   priority allocation of resources and protects contractors against certain third party claims.
   2.21.3. Carriers are allowed 3% of available allowable cabin load (ACL), by weight, for
   necessary self-support. For extended twin-engine operations purposes, the ACL is increased
   to 7.5% for aircraft committed to the AE Segment.
2.22. Airlift Requirements. International (long-range and short-range) airlift requirements for
national defense contingencies are based on JCS approved plans. Cargo and personnel
requirements that may require airlift support via civil aircraft are extracted from these plans.
They range from channel missions that maintain manageable levels at each port, to augmenting
the active force in deployment and resupply. Alaska airlift requirements are based on 11 AF and
Alaskan North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) region contingency plans and
requirements within the Alaskan AOR. Domestic airlift requirements are currently based on an
as-needed basis to move DOD personnel throughout the CONUS during CRAF activation.
Sizing of the CRAF fleet is based on these requirements.
2.23. Requirements for CRAF Membership. The following conditions must be met before a
carrier can participate in the CRAF program:
   2.23.1. The carrier must be a FAA Part 121 carrier.
   2.23.2. The carrier must be approved by the Commercial Airlift Review Board.
   2.23.3. The carrier must have 1 year prior equivalent uninterrupted service to the
   commercial sector.
   2.23.4. Minimum international fleet participation levels are 15% for cargo carriers and 30%
   for passenger carriers.
   2.23.5. The international fleet participant must be U.S.-flagged and capable of 10 hrs/day
   utilization rate (13 hrs/day for AE).
   2.23.6. See paragraphs 2.2 and 2.8.2 for manning and crew ratio.
   2.23.7. Flight deck aircrew flying CRAF missions are limited to U.S. citizens eligible for a
   SECRET clearance (see paragraph 2.2).

Section 2C—Organization

2.24. USTRANSCOM/CC (TCCC). TCCC, with SECDEF approval, holds CRAF activation
decision authority. The AMC/CC is the executor of CRAF activation.
2.25. HQ AMC/A3. From daily operations through CRAF activation, the HQ AMC/A3 retains
flag officer oversight of CRAF programmatic functions. This includes requesting increased
volunteerism from the carriers (see paragraphs 2.17 and 3.9.1.3.) and notifying industry of
pending activation.        However, once activated, the command, control and operational
employment of those carriers is under the purview of the 618 TACC Commander (TACC/CC).
This responsibility is consistent with both his/her command of daily AMC operations and the
staff expertise required to do so.
 20                                                       AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011


2.26. USTRANSCOM/AQ (or TCAQ). Responsible for procurement and contract
management of commercial airlift services. TCAQ plays an integral role in all phases of
commercial operations, from assigning routine missions to the run-up and aftermath of full
CRAF activation. TCAQ’s expertise and input is essential to the requests for increased
volunteers, operation of the CRAF Cell, to activation decision-making.
2.27. HQ AMC/A3B (or A3B). Directly responsible for the management of the CRAF
program. Prior to and during CRAF activation, A3B acting as the AMC CRAF Cell augments
and reports to the CAT-D for management of CRAF resources. CRAF Cell personnel normally
support contingencies from the A3B office. This cell may be required to stand up independently
when CAT is not in session. See Chapter 3 for details.
2.28. 618 TACC. 618 TACC schedules and tracks all CRAF aircraft supporting AMC missions
and if requested will provide information support to AMC leadership. If activated, the AMC
CRAF Cell (see 3.5.1) will provide support to 618 TACC as required. For intra-Alaska
missions, 11 AF provides mission oversight. A secondary requestor of CRAF information may
be the USTRANSCOM/J3 (Deployment Distribution Operations Center [DDOC]). Usually, they
gather CRAF information in support of TCCC.
2.29. AMC CAT Director (CAT-D). HQ AMC/A3X Division Chief directs the CAT and is
responsible for all CAT activities.
2.30. AMC CAT. Chaired by AMC/CV and comprised of the HQ AMC Directors and Special
Staff Agency (SSA) chiefs, the CAT, working in conjunction with 618 TACC, provides
AMC/CC with a flexible support staff tailored to meet worldwide air mobility requirements
during times of crisis. When activated, the CAT provides the AMC Commander expedited staff
action and a single focal point within the AMC staff for mission planning, management, and
command and control of AMC forces during time-sensitive operations.
2.31. Technical Advisory Group (TAG)/Mobility Representative (MOBREP). TAG is a
team of qualified airline representatives called MOBREPs, who are designated and provided by
CRAF carriers to furnish technical advice and information designed to provide maximum
coordination, efficiency, and effectiveness in the use of the CRAF. TAGs may be utilized during
peacetime and during CRAF activation. TAG members may be selected from any or all CRAF
carriers. The overriding prerequisite for selection must be the specific technical assistance
needed for development, maintenance, and execution of adequate CRAF plans. Before and
during activation, TAG expertise must be incorporated into CRAF planning.
2.32. CRAF Operations Support. The material and personnel who assist in the execution of
CRAF operations, as needed, during CRAF activation (see Chapter 4). This support may
consist of contracting with carriers for logistics support among other things.

Section 2D—Aircraft Selection Criteria

2.33. General. Aircraft allocated to the CRAF are selected to meet DOD airlift requirements.
Therefore, each segment of the CRAF is equipped commensurate with its anticipated tasking.
2.34. Criteria. Aircraft selection criteria for each segment of CRAF are as follows:
   2.34.1. International Segment, Long-Range Section (Cargo & Passenger):
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   21


     2.34.1.1. Extended Overwater/Worldwide Capability. Long-range aircraft must be
     equipped and maintained with the navigation, communications, and life-support
     systems/emergency equipment required to operate in transoceanic airspace, and on

     Performance Specification airspace and possess the applicable very high frequency
     (VHF), Mode-S, required navigation performance, and reduce vertical separation
     minimum communication and navigation capabilities.
     2.34.1.2. Range. The standard range capability for long range is 3,500NM for both
     passenger and cargo aircraft while carrying a productive payload. AMC, at its option,
     may include aircraft with a shorter range capability when there is a shortfall in long-range
     capability. However, the minimum acceptable range for this segment/section is the
     distance from San Francisco CA to Honolulu HI (2,350NM) with a productive payload.
     A productive payload is 75% of the aircraft’s maximum payload.
  2.34.2. International Segment, Short-Range Section:
     2.34.2.1. Cargo. Aircraft must be turbojet or turboprop, equipped for extended
     overwater operations, and capable of transporting a productive payload a distance of
     1,500NM, departing at sea level in a normal atmosphere. Preferred aircraft should have a
     door size that will accommodate a standard 463L pallet.
     2.34.2.2. Passenger. Aircraft must be turbojet or turboprop, equipped for extended
     overwater operations, and capable of transporting a productive payload a distance of
     1,500NM, departing at sea level in a normal atmosphere.
  2.34.3. AE Segment. The aeromedical capability of AMC is based upon the B-767 aircraft
  modified with AESS, which provides an aircraft configuration suitable to transporting 87
  litter patients. When needed, these aircraft will be fitted with an AESS, the equipment
  specifically designed to convert B-767s for the AE mission. These aircraft, while in a
  passenger configuration and prior to installation of the AESS, must be capable of meeting all
  requirements specified for the International Segment, Long-range Section.
  2.34.4. Domestic. The CRAF Domestic Services Section support wartime CONUS
  passenger and cargo airlift requirements.
     2.34.4.1. Cargo. Aircraft must be turbojet or turboprop and capable of transporting a
     minimum ACL of 32,000 lbs a distance of 1,500NM, departing at sea level in a normal
     atmosphere. Aircraft must have a door size that will accommodate a standard 463L pallet
     measuring 88 x 108 inches.
     2.34.4.2. Passenger. Aircraft must be turbojet or turboprop and capable of transporting a
     minimum of 75 passengers with a corresponding minimum ACL of 30,000 lbs a distance
     of 1,500NM, departing at sea level in a normal atmosphere.
  2.34.5. Alaskan. The CRAF Alaskan Section supports intra-Alaska operations. Aircraft
  selected for allocation must be located and available in Alaska. These aircraft are allocated
  to 11 AF and Alaskan NORAD region wartime airlift requirements in Alaska, northern
  Canada, and the northern Pacific.

Section 2E—Aircraft Equipment Requirements

2.35. Aircraft Passenger/Cargo Equipment (see AMCPAM 24-2V1, Civil Reserve Air Fleet
Load Planning Guide)
   2.34.1. Passenger aircraft will be configured in accordance with the FARs, the Defense
   Transportation Regulation, and airlift services contract.
2.36. Emergency and Safety Equipment. Emergency and safety equipment required by FAR
Part 121.339 satisfy CRAF extended overwater requirements, and those required by FAR Part
121.353 satisfy CRAF flight over uninhabited terrain.
2.37. Navigation Route Kit (NRK). The NRK, comprised of DOD Flight Information
Publications (FLIP), is provided by the government through the National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency (NGA) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). NGA publishes FLIP and DLA
manages FLIP accounts distribution. The initial kit requirement will be established through
A3B. Afterwards, CRAF carriers should communicate directly with DLA for matters concerning
required FLIP accounts and recurring distribution (see Attachment 2).

Section 2F—Mobilization Value (MV)

2.38. General. MV is a relative measure of the value that DOD places on commercial aircraft
for meeting wartime requirements.
2.39. Basic MV Factors. MV computation is based on aircraft payload capability, block speed,
range, and productive utilization rate, which is derived from the productivity factor as calculated
in AFPAM 10-1403, (Air Mobility Planning Factors). Computation data is derived from the
standard equipment, configuration, and performance capability of each aircraft.
2.40. International,       Long-/Short-Range      and     Aeromedical        Evacuation        MV
Computations. Computations are based on the relative capability of international, long-range,
short-range, and aeromedical evacuation aircraft. The aircraft chosen as the base aircraft is given
an equivalent factor of 1.
   2.40.1. Source Data. MV is computed from data submitted by carriers onthe CRAF Aircraft
   Basic Data Sheet and the CRAF Aircraft Performance Data Sheet. These Data Sheets are
   part of the solicitation for airlift services and and approved data must be on file in A3B in
   order to receive MV points.
2.41. Time Period for Computing and Recomputing MV. MV will be initially computed
after the carriers submit their CRAF Aircraft Data Sheet and CRAF Aircraft Performance Data
Sheet to AMC at contract solicitation. Afterwards, if there are changes to the CRAF fleet, A3BC
will recompute MV as needed, throughout the contract period, with the resulting MV points
applying only to expansion business.

                                            Chapter 3

                   CRAF MISSION SCHEDULING AND ACTIVATION

Section 3A—Mission Scheduling

3.1. General. During an activation, CRAF long- and short-range international and AE mission
oversight is the responsibility of the AMC CRAF Cell. The scheduling of CRAF missions is
similar to the current procedures used by AMC and the CRAF carriers in scheduling peacetime
DOD airlift mission. This chapter contains guidance pertaining to the procedures employed to
manage the additional workload created by CRAF activation.
3.2. Purpose. To ensure proper use of CRAF resources during CRAF activation.
3.3. Mission. The primary objective is to schedule and manage CRAF missions effectively.
The CRAF Cell, in coordination with the Airlift Allocation Division (618 TACC/XOBA) and the
Aeromedical Evacuation Division (618 TACC/XOPA), will exercise CRAF mission oversight.
3.4. Concept. Mission scheduling will be accomplished by the following: CRAF Cell;
USTRANSCOM/AQ-C; 618 TACC/ XOGC, XOOO, or XOPC as appropriate; and CRAF
carrier operations centers.
   3.4.1. The CRAF Cell, in coordination with USTRANSOMC/AQ-C, determines the best
   type of aircraft available from among current CRAF participants for specific requirements.
   The carrier is then notified that it has been designated for the mission and submits its aircraft
   specific information to the originating 618 TACC division (XOGC, XOOO, or XOPC) and
   USTRANSCOM/AQ-C.
   3.4.2. 618 TACC AE planners will coordinate with the CRAF Cell when the AE Segment of
   CRAF is activated.
3.5. Manpower and Personnel. Upon activation of any stage of CRAF, and when directed by
the AMC CAT-D, selected HQ AMC personnel will report to the AMC CAT to perform
specified duties involving the management of CRAF airlift missions. (Note: AMC CAT may
not have formed during CRAF pre-activation or activation.) When requested by A3B, CRAF
carriers will establish a 24-hour/day operations center manned by qualified personnel and located
at the carrier's designated operations centers. Subsequent to the activation of Stage II and prior
to Stage III activation, selected CRAF carriers will, upon the request of the AMC CAT-D,
provide predesignated carrier liaison and communications supervisor personnel to HQ AMC,
Scott AFB IL. To assure appropriate liaison representation and to facilitate assimilation of tasks,
arriers should provide personnel with a high degree of knowledge and experience in the carrier’s
overall operations and management.
   3.5.1. CRAF Cell Personnel. The CRAF Cell will be manned with at least one individual,
   available 24-hours/day, from the following offices. A3B Division Chief/designated
   representative will be cell director and may adjust the following list and 24-hour requirement
   as needed.
       3.5.1.1. A3BC
       3.5.1.2. USTRANSCOM/AQ
 24                                                        AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011


       3.5.1.3. AMC/A4TC
       3.5.1.4. 618 TACC/XOGC. Note: XOGC is not manned 24/7. XOGC is on-call 24/7
       and manned during normal M-F duty hours.

       mission execution. (At-need problems during operations are passed via normal command
       and control channels in accordance with contractual agreements.)

Section 3B—AMC CRAF Activation/Deactivation Actions

3.7. General. This section provides an expanded view of basic actions involved in using CRAF,
to include key factors affecting its employment. In addition to procedures outlined below, there
is a civil air crisis response checklist with supplementary actions to be performed prior to and
during CRAF activation. A copy of the checklist is in both the A3BC CRAF Activation book,
while copies of the activation/deactivation checklist are included in the CAT OIs. For AE
activation specifics see paragraph 13.2.1
3.8. CRAF Pre-Activation Procedures. CRAF is activated by TCCC with the approval of the
SECDEF. When TCCC has directed CRAF activation, CRAF carriers, DOT/OET, FAA,
OSD/TP and other applicable agencies must be advised as soon as possible. The HQ AMC/A3
will coordinate with AMC/JA, 18 AF/CC, and AMC/CV prior to the release of an activation
message.
   3.8.1. Activation Requests.       When a supported Combatant Commander provides
   USTRANSCOM with requirements in excess of the capability of organic airlift,
   USTRANSCOM/J3 (DDOC) will consult with TCAQ, 618 TACC, and A3B concerning the
   activation of CRAF assets to provide additional support. When AMC and USTRANSCOM
   staffs agree and advise TCCC that CRAF activation is necessary, A3B will prepare an
   activation request message for TCCC. This request to SECDEF will include authorization to
   activate all available forces up to and including Stage II. In accordance with a standing
 26                                                        AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011


   MOU between DOT and DOD, a Stage III activation will require a separate request to
   SECDEF. In any case, once SECDEF approval is granted, the activation process begins.
3.9. CRAF Activation Procedures.
   3.9.1. Activation Process. The process for CRAF activation is briefly outlined as:
       3.9.1.1. Supported Combatant Commander requests forces/materiel.
       3.9.1.2. USTRANSCOM/J3 (DDOC/Fusion Center) assesses requirement in conjunction
       with 618 TACC.
       3.9.1.3. If current airlift capability does not meet requirements, A3B and TCAQ assess
       industry's capacity at time of request. If required, A3B and TCAQ will arrange a
       teleconference between HQ AMC/A3 and MOBREPs to request additional volunteerism
       from industry (see also paragraph 2-17).
       3.9.1.4. If additional volunteerism does not meet requirements, A3B, TCAQ, 618 TACC,
       and USTRANSCOM/J3 (DDOC) will determine which segment, section, and element of
       the activated CRAF will be needed to meet COCOM requirements.
       3.9.1.5. A3B sends alert warning notification of activation to carriers after input from
       618 TACC/CC and HQ AMC/A3.
       3.9.1.6. HQ AMC/A3B drafts a staff summary sheet (SSS) and a request message for
       TCCC seeking SECDEF approval for CRAF activation. As stated above, TCCC’s initial
       request to SECDEF will specify activation authority for all forces up to and including
       Stage II. Before leaving HQ AMC, the SSS is coordinated through 18 AF, AMC/JA,
       AMC/CV, and then approved by AMC/CC (see Attachment 5).
       3.9.1.7. The AMC/CC-signed SSS and hard copy message is delivered to the Chief of
       USTRANSCOM/DDOC, who in turn delivers it to TCCC. TCCC either sends the
       request message to SECDEF or requests activation authorization via telephone.
       3.9.1.8. SECDEF approves activation and sends approval via response message or
       telephone to TCCC. TCCC activates CRAF through AMC/CC.
       3.9.1.9. 618 TACC determines what segment, section, and element of CRAF is needed
       and TCAQ makes assignments.
       3.9.1.10. HQ AMC/A3 sends an activation message and/or e-mail to the air carriers
       specifying aircraft by carrier, stage, segment, element etc.
       3.9.1.11. TCAQ determines need/availability of aviation war risk insurance in
       coordination with AMC/JA.
3.10. Notification. CRAF activation messages are transmitted over civil circuits to each CRAF
carrier. Historically, sending unclassified information via e-mail has proven faster than facsimile
machine (notification accomplished within minutes versus hours). These messages are described
as follows:
   3.10.1. Request for Declaration of Airlift Emergency and/or CRAF Activation. This
   message is released by the HQ AMC/A3 with an action copy to TCCC and an information
   copy to the Chief of Staff, United States Air Force. It should contain necessary data for
   requesting the activation of CRAF Stages I, II, or III.

  President or the Congress or their designee). Should communications with HQ USAF be
  lost, the HQ AMC/A3 will proceed with message release. The message will include the
  approximate percentage of aircraft and type of airlift (cargo, passenger, or AE), which may
  be required.
  3.10.8. Presidential Authority (Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2644) Control of Transportation
  Systems in Time of War. This message is addressed to all CRAF carriers with information to
  all military and governmental agencies associated with CRAF operations. It advises all
  concerned that the President has invoked his authority under Title 10, U.S. Code and
  provides the effective date and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). It also advises the CRAF
  carriers that mission assignment and AMC Command and Control will function from the 618
 28                                                       AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011


   TACC. The message will be released by the HQ AMC/A3 upon receipt of proper authority
   from TCCC and after coordination with the 18 AF/CC and the AMC CAT.
   3.10.9. CRAF Border Clearance Support. This message will be addressed to U.S. Public
   Health, Immigration, Customs, Agriculture, and U.S. Passport offices. It provides Stage III
   CRAF activation notification to these agencies, advising them of a substantially increased
   flow of air traffic and requests their support.
3.11. Limitation on Use of CRAF Aircraft.
   3.11.1. Aircraft Management. In order to minimize cost to the government and disruption of
   each carrier's civil schedules and service, only those aircraft actually needed by AMC will be
   called up and those no longer needed will be released to the carrier for commercial
   operations as soon as possible.
   3.11.2. Cargo Loading. Information on types of cargo and load configuration is contained in
   AMCP 24-2. Some cargo capable wide body aircraft may carry oversize cargo and wheeled
   vehicles mounted on pallets or loaded directly on a pallet subfloor. Narrow body cargo
   aircraft can carry bulk cargo and some may be able to transport wheeled vehicles on pallets,
   provided the cargo door and floor are compatible with the vehicle being loaded.
   3.11.3. Minimum Takeoff/Landing Roll. For the purpose of general planning by all agencies
   using this instruction, onload airfields normally require at least 8,000 feet of runway for
   maximum gross weight takeoffs. Offload airfields require a minimum of 7,000 feet for
   landing.
   3.11.4. Engine Running Onload/Offload (ERO). CRAF aircraft are not suitable for EROs.
   Therefore, do not plan ERO for CRAF operations.

Section 3C—Air Carrier’s CRAF Activation Actions

3.12. Air Carrier’s CRAF Activation Checklist. During CRAF activation, carriers will
receive the messages specified below.
   3.12.1. AMC CAT Activation Message. After senior executive personnel have received this

Section 3D—Air Carrier’s CRAF Deactivation Actions

3.13. Air Carrier’s CRAF Deactivation Checklist.
   3.13.1. Coordinate with 618 TACC/XOP and TCAQ to confirm the amount of civil air
   augmentation meets current requirements.
   3.13.2. Determine the CRAF capability available. Sustained requirements equal to or less
   than the number of seats available from volunteers should trigger consideration to deactivate
   the CRAF.
   3.13.3. Reassess the need for continuation of any existing contract response team
   augmentation with carrier management representatives.
   3.13.4. Coordinate with USTRANSCOM and 618 TACC/XOP to determine projected date
   for deactivation.
30                                                    AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011

  AMC/CC and TCCC.
  3.13.7. If necessary, coordinate with 618 TACC/XOPA and the 77 Aeromedical Systems
  Group (AESG/TFA) on CRAF AE requirements for possible deactivation of AE. Notify the
  Defense Contract Management Agency (see CRAF AESS CLS Activation Recall Plan) and
  L3 IS program manager, 903-457-5333/3450 to notify them that carriers will be deactivated
  and their aircraft reconfigured.
  3.13.8. Request TCCC coordinate CRAF deactivation with the CJCS and the Chief of Staff
  of the Air Force. TCCC will then recommend a deactivation date to the SECDEF.
  3.13.9. Prepare message for TCCC to send to SECDEF requesting deactivation.
  3.13.10. Following SECDEF approval for deactivation, prepare message for carriers
  notifying them of deactivation in 15 days.
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   31


                                           Chapter 4

                              CRAF OPERATIONS SUPPORT

4.1. Concept. The intent of this concept is to make full use of the knowledge, resources, and/or
arrangements that may be available during CRAF activation in order to support CRAF
operations worldwide. Carriers may be contracted for assistance in providing support to
operations. It is also recognized that selected military personnel may be needed to augment
personnel at an existing base to be used as an Intermediate Staging Base (ISB), or to bed down
an ISB in a location chosen for its ability to effectively support CRAF operations. This support
will utilize existing contracts and arrangements to the greatest extent possible.
4.2. Definitions.
   4.2.1. ISB.     An ISB is used to support CRAF operations where intelligence,
   chemical/biological ground ensemble distribution, or other services are necessary as part of
   the CRAF Enabling Concept. ISBs could be an existing Air Force base, or set up at a
   commercial airfield as necessary. A3B selects strategically located civil airports or military
   airfields as ISBs, based on the airport and local area facilities available, the needs of CRAF
   and AMC, and in coordination with the Threat Working Group and TACC Planning
   Directorates.
   4.2.2. Augmenting ISB Personnel. Some ISB personnel may be civilians supplied by the
   activated CRAF airlines; see 4.5.5.4, Civil Airlift Support Specialist (CASS). DOD
   personnel may also augment an ISB and perform duties as required to support CRAF
   operations.
       4.2.2.1. DOD Personnel Augmenting the ISB. The CRAF OST Force module (8ECRF
       within the 088EF PID [Extended Force Module PID]) provides augmentees to support
       CRAF operations. The sizing of the augmenting team will be IAW paragraph 4.5.2
       Once sized, selection of members (sourcing) is performed by their AF or MAJCOM-level
       functional area managers (FAMs) who select personnel by unit type codes (UTCs).
       Personnel may be drawn from anywhere in the AF or from a single MAJCOM. Support
       provided by these personnel may include, but is not limited to, C-CBRNE familiarization,
       intelligence, weather, and mission briefings, to be coordinated through the CRAF Cell.
       Once personnel are selected, their names and details of their movement to the ISB will
       also be coordinated through the CRAF Cell. (See 4.5 CRAF Enabling Concept)
4.3. CRAF Support Contract Provisions. All CRAF support services will be provided
through provisions of an AMC Airlift Services contract modification issued by TCAQ. The
Airlift Services contract makes provision for the activation of CRAF support services as required
during CRAF activation. The TCAQ Airlift Contracting Officer (ACO) will issue the contract
modification.
4.4. Traffic Management. For planning purposes, airlift planners should route carriers through
ISBs when support requirements necessitate their establishment.
4.5. CRAF Enabling Concept. The CRAF program is a vital part of DOD’s airlift capability.
Up to 93% of all passenger and 40% of all cargo is planned to be moved via CRAF during a
major conflict. When activated, a large number of civilian airline aircrew members will transit
 32                                                        AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011


through an ISB en route to forward operating locations (FOLs). Civil aircrews need support at
ISBs to ensure they are prepared to enter the AOR, and military personnel need civilian expertise
when dealing with a large influx of civilian aircraft at locations within the AOR. This concept is
based on support for commercial aircraft prior to and after entering the AOR. Prior to entering
the AOR, a CRAF flight, if at all possible, will make a stop at a CRAF ISB. While there, the
CRAF aircrew will receive intelligence briefings, authentication material, as well as chemical
warfare defense equipment and training, if required. In theater, CRAF aircrews will normally
receive support from military personnel at the FOL. The CRAF Enabling Concept will place a
CRAF OST at ISBs and a CASS at FOLs.
   4.5.1. The CRAF Enabling Concept will be executed as needed in the event of CRAF
   activation. This concept may also be implemented without CRAF activation in the event of
   heightened operations tempo and increased air carrier volunteerism.
   4.5.2. The decision to activate a CRAF ISB will be made by HQ AMC Director of Air Space
   and Information Operations (HQ AMC/A3). As the ISB personnel (see Operations Support
   Team, next paragraph) are deployed to support commercial carrier operations, the process of
   right-sizing the OST (pair and tailoring) will include inputs from the CRAF Cell, FAMs and
   618 TACC, and be approved by AMC/A3. Per para. 4.5.5.1.1 the choice of ISB location will
   be coordinated through 618 TACC.
   4.5.3. CRAF Operations Support Team (OST). An ISB will be established during CRAF
   activation, or if necessary, during increased operations tempo supported by increased air
   carrier volunteerism. ISBs will be used as ―gateways‖ or civil aircraft staging bases for entry
   into the AOR. CRAF missions entering the AOR will normally be contracted to arrive via an
   ISB. CRAF OSTs will serve as the point of contact for carriers unfamiliar with that airport’s
   operations and/or unable to obtain services through normal company contracts. The CRAF
   OST serves as the 24-hour point of contact for airfield and aircrew issues unable to be
   resolved by normal lines of communication, as well as obtaining services and solving
   logistical problems beyond civil airlines control. Military manpower for the OST will be
   derived from the CRAF Enabling Concept Force module; this team will consist of up to 16
   functional specialists, depending on requirements.
       4.5.3.1. The ISB will be managed by a CRAF OST.
       4.5.3.2. The CRAF OST Commander will notify A3B and the CAT of additional military
       support requirements and/or equipment shortfalls as soon as possible after arrival at the
       ISB.
       4.5.3.3. If practical, A3B will complete an on-site survey at proposed CRAF ISB
       locations prior to the arrival of the CRAF OST.
       4.5.3.4. The CRAF OST will also provide aircrews with chemical warfare defense
       equipment and training and intelligence briefings.
       4.5.3.5. Due to possible ISB locations, CRAF OST personnel must be prepared to
       perform duties in civilian clothes. All transient military personnel in uniform may be
       required to stay on the aircraft.
       4.5.3.6. The CRAF OST Commander will coordinate with an identified civilian airline
       liaison, but will have full responsibility of all CRAF operations at the ISB.
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    33


     4.5.3.7. The AFTRANS 618 TACC/Air Mobility Division is responsible for flow control
     into/out of the AOR. Cancellations and/or mission changes must be coordinated through
     TCAQ and 618 TACC/XOCG. The CRAF OST may be asked to facilitate
     communication with a particular mission, but holds no command and control authority.
     4.5.3.8. Although the CRAF OST will be in-place to support CRAF flights, commercial
     carriers will utilize existing contracts and arrangements for aircraft servicing and aircrew
     support to the maximum extent possible. They will also utilize civilian communications
     capabilities and infrastructure for mission reporting, changes, and planning.
     4.5.3.9. CRAF aircrews will receive information through normal channels (carrier
     operation centers).
  4.5.4. CRAF OST Composition and Duties. The CRAF OST is made up of the following
  personnel (final composition depends on the ISB location and in-place resources).
     4.5.4.1. OST Commander/Liaison Officer. Oversees the establishment of an ISB and
     serves as liaison for civilian concerns to be aired directly with the responsible agency.
     Coordinates with the local U.S. Embassy for assistance with local issues and for
     intelligence information. Ensures that sufficient authentication material, if required, is on
     hand for issue to CRAF aircrews. However, Communications Security (COMSEC)
     material should be issued to CRAF aircrews upon departure from CONUS bases if
     needed. Will work with local contractors to procure cell phones for OST members; one
     cell phone will have overseas long distance capability. The person filling this position
     should be a Field Grade Officer.
     4.5.4.2. Command and Control. Ensures correct data is input into the Global Decision
     Support System (GDSS), Command and Control Information Processing System, or
     GDSS II. They will also utilize the Global Transportation Network; the designated DOD
     in-transit visibility system.
     4.5.4.3. Intelligence. Presents pre-mission briefings on AOR threat environment to
     CRAF crews and conducts post-mission debriefs either in person or via secure telephone
     equipment/secure telephone unit III (STE/STU-III). Intel will deploy with, at a
     minimum, a classified laptop for connection into a Secret Internet Protocol Router
     Network (SIPRNET) line, printer, and STE secure phone.
     4.5.4.4. Civil Engineering Readiness. Provides chemical warfare defense equipment
     training to civilian aircrews IAW AMCPAM 10-260, Civil Reserve Fleet (CRAF)
     Aircrew Chemical – Biological (CB) Warfare Defense Procedures. Due to anticipated
     1.5-hour ground time, training will likely take place on the aircraft.
     4.5.4.5. Supply (Mobility Bags).          Manages, issues, receives, and maintains
     accountability for CRAF individual protective equipment (IPE). They will request
     additional IPE to ensure mission execution. Supply personnel will board transiting
     CRAF aircraft, obtain size information from the crew, and deliver the appropriate sized
     chemical warfare defense equipment to the aircrew. Mobility bag accountability will
     reside with supply functionals on the OST. Accountability will be maintained with hand
     receipts; special circumstances will be coordinated with CRAF carriers by A3B.
34                                                       AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011


     4.5.4.6. Communications Support. Provides support to include up to two personnel and
     required Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET)/SIPRNET
     connectivity (i.e., satellite communications).
     4.5.4.7. A3B will coordinate through TCAQ for the OST to purchase cell phones upon
     arrival at the ISB. A3B will also provide a minimum of two STE terminals.
  4.5.5. OST Support Responsibilities. The CRAF OST may require support from the
  following organizations to accomplish its mission, if required:
     4.5.5.1. A3B (DOD Commercial Airlift Division) will:
        4.5.5.1.1. Select ISBs in coordination with 618 TACC and air carriers. Locations
        will be based on suitability for aircraft, airfield security, airfield capacity, aircraft
        parking, aircraft servicing capability, billeting for civilian and military personnel,
        existing commercial air carrier contract vehicles, and ability to support other CRAF
        OST functions.
        4.5.5.1.2. Select a civilian carrier at ISBs that will act as a liaison with the civilian
        airport for the CRAF OST Commander. This carrier will have pre-established
        administrative and logistical connections and will be contracted to assist with
        providing contractor en route support.
        4.5.5.1.3. Identify the amount of IPE and coordinate/fund shipments to each ISB.
        CRAF chemical warfare defense equipment is currently stored by the 436 LRS,
        Dover AFB.
        4.5.5.1.4. Work with 618 TACC to attempt ―express‖ routing of IPE back to ISBs.
        As a standard, all CRAF flights into the AOR will be contracted to return through an
        ISB. For missions not contracted to return through the ISB, the aircrew will leave
        their IPE with the AEW/AEG LRS in the AOR. The IPE will then be shipped via the
        next available aircraft back to the ISB.
     4.5.5.2. TCAQ will ensure all ISB en route support services provided in connection with
     CRAF operations will be through provisions of a contract modification issued by HQ
     AMC. A TCAQ contracting officer will issue all change orders. This change order will
     include the following support for the OST: general office space, chemical warfare
     defense equipment storage, COMSEC storage, and additional telephone lines for secure
     telephone and secure fax communication, as well as logistics support for the aircraft.
     4.5.5.3. Upon notification from A3B, 436 LRS, Dover AFB, will build specified
     number/sizes of C-Bags (chemical warfare ensembles), and prepare for shipment. The
     bags should depart Dover AFB via ground or air within 24 hours of notification. 436
     LRS Supply personnel may be tasked to provide one lead Supply person per CRAF ISB.
     4.5.5.4. Civil Airlift Support Specialist (CASS). Mobile Command and Control Forces
     and Expeditionary Wings are responsible for all incoming and outgoing airfield
     operations at FOLs. Commercial aircraft pose a significant challenge to military planners
     and airfield operators. A CASS fills this commercial airlift expertise gap. CASS
     personnel are civilian airline employees with extensive knowledge in civilian logistics
     and aircrew operations. CASS personnel will be assigned at locations within the AOR
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   35


     receiving high civilian traffic loads and will coordinate with the on scene airfield support
     structure.
        4.5.5.4.1. The assignment of CASS personnel will be at the discretion of HQ AMC
        Director of Air Space and Information Operations (HQ AMC/A3).
     4.5.5.5. CASS Duties:
        4.5.5.5.1. Assist with and coordinate civilian aircraft handling and crew management
        issues. Advise and coordinate for effective turn-around of civilian air assets.
        4.5.5.5.2. Deploy, if possible, with an ARINC communications terminal and
        appropriate civilian aircraft load planning technical orders and guidance.
     4.5.5.6. Responsibilities. For the CASS program to work, support from the following
     organizations may be required:
        4.5.5.6.1. CRAF Carriers will provide a list of highly qualified CASS personnel to
        A3B upon receipt of an activation/warning order or as requested. Carriers will be
        compensated for costs associated with providing such personnel. CASS personnel
        must be U.S. citizens eligible for a SECRET clearance, fully skilled, and experienced
        in carrier communication systems and load planning operations.
        4.5.5.6.2. TCAQ will ensure CASS personnel contract provisions are met IAW
        DODI 3020.41.
        4.5.5.6.3. Expeditionary Wing Commanders will:
            4.5.5.6.3.1. Forward requests for CASS support to A3B through 618 TACC.

Section 5A—Concept

5.1. CRAF Operations Authority.
   5.1.1. CRAF Operations. CRAF operations will be conducted in accordance with
   procedures outlined in this instruction, AMCI 24-201, Commercial Airlift Management-Civil
   Air Carriers, the terms of the current AMC Airlift Services contract, and AMCI 24-101,
   Military Airlift Transportation, Volumes 5 (Military Airlift--Baggage Service) and 16
   (Military Airlift-Border Clearance). Any situation or subject not covered herein will be
   resolved by the AMC CAT.
   5.1.2. CRAF Carrier Flight Operations. Carrier flight operations will be conducted in
   accordance with all applicable FARs and carrier operating manuals.
5.2. Operations. For contingency planning, the airlift capability in support of missions during
CRAF activation is based on a daily aircraft utilization rate of 10 hours. Other requirements for
contingency planning are listed below.
   5.2.1. The long-range section of the International Segment satisfies JCS requirements that
   exceed the capability of AMC's organic long-range aircraft.
   5.2.2. The short-range section of the International Segment satisfies medium-range offshore
   DOD airlift requirements.
   5.2.3. The AE Segment uses an average daily aircraft utilization rate of 13 hours.
   5.2.4. The domestic section of the National Segment satisfies DOD airlift requirements to
   move personnel throughout the CONUS during CRAF activation.
   5.2.5. The Alaska section of the National Segment is allocated aircraft for providing required
   airlift to satisfy intra-Alaska requirements.
5.3. Exemption from Seizure. JCS-approved Unified Command Plans exempt AMC transport
aircraft engaged in the execution of approved war plans from seizure by theater commanders.
CRAF strategic capable aircraft and crews will not be detained for uses other than AMC's
strategic airlift support of the theater commander.
5.4. Allocation of the Fleet. Aircraft are allocated to CRAF by DOT/OET under the authority
of the Defense Production Act of 1950 as amended (50 USC, App.2061, et. seq.). This
allocation is based upon such factors as DOD-approved airlift requirements and suitability of
civil aircraft.
5.5. Passenger Aircraft. Passenger aircraft will arrive at onload site prepared to receive
passengers/troops.
5.6. Cargo Aircraft. Cargo aircraft will arrive at onload site prepared to receive main deck
cargo loaded on military 463L pallets. Lower lobes should be prepared for bulk loading.
5.7. Convertible Aircraft. Convertible aircraft will be in the cargo configuration unless

self-support.

Section 5B—Communications

5.10. In-flight Command and Control (C2) Procedures.
   5.10.1. Mission progress reporting. CRAF aircrews will take actions to ensure that
   appropriate AMC C2 agencies receive timely updates on mission progress. This must be
   accomplished while on active AMC missions and when positioning for active AMC
   missions. C2 agencies are responsible for transmitting this information to other AMC
   agencies as required. If direct contact with an AMC C2 agency is not possible, the aircrew
   should contact its carrier operations center for relay or retransmission to 618 TACC/XOCG.
   5.10.2. Information to be passed and time of reporting is as follows:
       5.10.2.1. Arrival/departure messages. Within 15 minutes of arriving or departing a
       station, aircrews will pass their AMC mission number, aircraft number, actual time of
       arrival or departure, and estimated time of departure or arrival. Times will be in GMT.
       5.10.2.2. En route communications. Prior to passing over the geographical boundaries of
       a theater operation area, or as a minimum, 2 hours prior to landing, aircrews must contact
       the designated AMC C2 agency and pass their mission number, aircraft number,
       estimated time of arrival (ETA) for destination or alternate, and any significant
       maintenance problems.
       5.10.2.3. Communication with destination station. Thirty minutes before arrival,
       aircrews must contact the destination AMC C2 agency for confirmation/revision of
       information passed in paragraph 5.10.2.2
   5.10.3. The AMC C2 agency commander or senior AMC representative will assure CRAF
   aircrews receive:
       5.10.3.1. The latest available communications information concerning the proposed route
       of flight.
       5.10.3.2. Sufficient authentication materials to cover the next 72 hours.
   5.10.4. Emergency Security Control of Air Traffic (ESCAT). Aircraft in flight over the
   CONUS shall be dispersed to safe haven bases, as directed by air traffic control authorities.
   If such dispersal plans are implemented, operations will be in accordance with the
   requirements of that portion of the ESCAT plan, which is in effect. If any part of the ESCAT
   plan is ordered while dispersal is in progress, dispersal operations will be revised as required
   to comply with ESCAT. When conditions permit, company management shall retain control
   of the dispersed aircraft and shall direct re-assembly of aircraft at predetermined regroup
   operating bases, or dispatch to specified onload bases. Airlift mission assignments will then
   come from 618 TACC and be routed through the carrier corporate management and
   operations personnel.

      5.10.4.1. NORADIinstruction 10-41 (S) provides the Safe Passage procedures for CRAF
      aircraft departing from and returning to CONUS. Specific Identification, Friend or
      Foe/Selective Identification Feature (IFF/SIF) instructions are detailed in the "NORAD
      Master SPINS" document. CRAF-allocated aircraft that are offshore when safe passage
      procedures are implemented, shall divert to the nearest base listedin Table 5.1, or as
      directed by Air Traffic Control, to obtain specific procedural information required for
      penetration and operation in the NORAD area. Base operations personnel at one of the
      following locations shall provide the NORAD information to cleared carrier personnel
      prior to aircraft departure for entry into the NORAD defense area. 618 TACC will work
      with the AMC CRAF Cell and carrier operations personnel to ensure that appropriate
      classified Safe Passage and IFF/SFF information is made available to CRAF carriers.
      Upon activation of CRAF, and when required by NORAD, Safe Passage procedures
      provide that each flight crewmember possess a SECRET clearance prior to being granted
      access.

Table 5.1. Divert Bases for Compliance with NORAD Instruction 10-41
 ATLANTIC AREA:          Incirlik AB, Turkey; Lajes Field, Portugal
 PACIFIC AREA:           Andersen AFB, Guam; Yokota AB, Japan; Kadena AB, Japan; Hickam
                         AFB, Hawaii; Elmendorf AFB/Cold Bay AFS (714 ACWS), Alaska. (If
                         aircraft is on the ground at Anchorage International, contact Elmendorf
                         AFB. If aircraft is airborne within the Alaska area, divert to Cold Bay
                         AFS.)


5.11. Messages. The following operational messages are necessary for mission control and
flight following by the AMC CAT.
   5.11.1. Operational Messages. There are three kinds: departure, arrival, and advisory.
   Addressees should be the next intended landing site operations center, the appropriate carrier,
   618 TACC/XOCG, and A3B.
   5.11.2. When standard communications are not possible, the crew should communicate the
   following information to their parent company (or the most accessible military flight facility)
   by the most rapid and efficient method at their disposal:
      5.11.2.1. Actual time of arrival in GMT.
      5.11.2.2. Estimate time of departure in GMT.
      5.11.2.3. Proposed destination and estimated time of arrival in GMT.
      5.11.2.4. Maintenance problems.
      5.11.2.5. Other information as necessary.

Section 5C—Aircrew, Scheduling, and Mission Management

5.12. General. During CRAF activation, mission scheduling for long- and short-range
international, AE, and domestic missions will be accomplished by 618 TACC. Mission to be
flown by carriers in the Alaska Segment will be directed by 11 AF. Carriers will schedule
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 39


aircrews and aircraft. The remainder of Section 5C applies only to Long- and Short-Range
International and AE Segments.
5.13. Deviation from Mission Schedule. Except for emergency or safety reasons, deviations
from mission schedules must be authorized by the AMC CAT and coordinated with the
Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO).
5.14. Aircrew Scheduling and Staging Responsibility. Aircrew scheduling and staging will
normally be done by the CRAF carrier.
5.15. Aircrew Complement. The air carrier aircrew composition is the decision of the CRAF
carrier in accordance with carrier operating manuals and Part 121 of the FAR.
   5.15.1. The USAF AE crew composition will be determined by the chief nurse of the AE
   unit, based upon patient load and acuity. A normal B-767 AE crew is composed of four
   flight nurses and six AE technicians.
   5.15.2. Both assignment of carrier or FAA/personnel as check airmen or instructors, as well
   as the movement of stage crews are authorized. However, additional crewmembers shall not
   reduce the ACL available to AMC without AMC CAT-D coordination and ACO approval.
   5.15.3. Prior to boarding the aircraft, crewmembers must present proper written authority to
   the operations officer, dispatch center, or AMC representative.
5.16. Aircrew Notification.
   5.16.1. CONUS. Crew notification will be accomplished by the CRAF carrier.
   5.16.2. Overseas. Crew notification may be accomplished by the carrier at civil airports and
   by base operations or the AMC C2 agency at military airfields.
5.17. Aircraft Ground Time. For planning purposes, the ground times in Table 5.2 may be
used. Actual ground times are based on mission need. Some loads may require additional time
and will be determined by TACC planners and carrier when mission is established.

aircraft is properly configured to accommodate 463L pallets. 4. Add 1 hour if subfloor must be
installed or removed. 5. No aircraft servicing to include catering is planned.

5.18. Overflight and Landing. DoD contract aircraft operate as "unscheduled civil aircraft"
and do not qualify as state aircraft unless the particular aircraft is specifically designated as such
by the US Government. Contractors must therefore obtain necessary overflight and landing
clearances for their aircraft through the overflown and/or host nation’s clearance procedures for
nonscheduled civil. The International Flight Information Manual (IFIM) outlines points of
contact and responsibilities for obtaining overflight and landing from appropriate foreign civil
aviation authorities. Under very limited circumstances, 618 TACC/XOCZD, may be involved in
the foreign clearance process with DoD contract carriers. For questions or more information,
contact the 618 TACC/XOCZD, which will contact the DoD Executive Agent for the Foreign
Clearance Program as necessary.
5.19. Call Signs. Contract carriers is on an flying AMC missions, may be authorized to use a
special call sign that identifies their aircraft as a DoD contract aircraft. When this special call
sign is authorized, it may only be used by contract aircraft on mission segments for which use of
the special call sign is required as a condition of an overflight and/or landing clearance, as
instructed by 618 TACC/XOCZD.
5.20. AMC’s Automatic E-mail. AMC has established an e-mail program to provide accurate
and timely overflight and landing clearance information to the contractors. The e-mails are auto-
generated from the GDSS database every 3 hours as changes occur. E-mail includes a current
itinerary and overflight and landing clearance information. TCAQ-CM maintains the e-mail list.
Contractors should keep their e-mail addresses current and are encouraged to use organizational
addresses versus personnel addresses, due to personnel turnover.

Section 5D—Aircrew Restrictions

5.21. Flight Deck Crew Eligibility. During activation, flight deck crewmembers must be U.S.
citizens and be eligible for a U.S. SECRET clearance.
5.22. Flight Time Limitations. The flight time limitation for CRAF crewmembers is specified
in the FAR and the carrier's aircraft operating manual, unless otherwise waived by the FAA.
Carriers with union agreements should, where possible, have agreements that permit aircrew
operations during CRAF activation up to the maximum limits specified by FAR and safe
operating practices.

Section 5E—Air Carrier Dispatch Procedures

5.23. Aircraft Captain's Authority. Aircraft captains may:
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                     41


   5.23.1. Delay or discontinue flight for safety considerations.
   5.23.2. Initiate a change in flight plan when, in Captain’ opinion, this change is necessary for
   reasons of safety.
   5.23.3. If company operational policy permits, release the flight when operating in support
   of CRAF.
5.24. Alternate Airports.
   5.24.1. Selection. When flight planning alternate airports for CRAF missions, CRAF
   carriers must consider the following:
       5.24.1.1. For foreign offload destinations, plan as first priority for a U. S. military
       airfield or an airfield with U.S. military facilities. (TACC planners may provide
       preferred alternate airfields.)
       5.24.1.2. Availability of billeting and messing facilities for passenger missions.
       5.24.1.3. Overflight and landing clearance requirements, overflight agreements, and
       security considerations for missions carrying dangerous or special handling cargo.
   5.24.2. Coordination. The nearest or most available AMC operations center/command post
   should be contacted before proceeding to an alternate.
   5.24.3. AE Missions. In addition to the above considerations, a jetway casualty transport
   system, or equivalent MHE must be available. A satisfactory patient holding facility may
   also be required.

Section 5F—Special Operating Procedures

5.25. Early Departure. CRAF aircraft are expected to depart and arrive on time. If aircraft
loading/offloading operations are completed ahead of schedule, the AMC CRAF Cell must
authorize early departure from any station.
5.26. Emergency and Survival Equipment. CRAF carriers are responsible for providing
overwater, emergency, and survival equipment in compliance with the FAR.
5.27. Priority of Aircraft. During CRAF activation, military and civil transport aircraft flying
in support of the contingency will receive the same priority.
5.28. Counter-Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive (C-
CBRNE) Training. Due to the availability of CBRNE weapons to terrorists and other potential
adversaries, AMC will provide a C-CBRNE training video (threat avoidance and personal
protection measures) to each carrier for their use in initial and annual training. In the event of
CRAF operations where the threat of CBRNE weapons use exists, AMC will issue chemical
warfare ground ensembles to the carriers at ISBs to protect aircrew members who are caught on
the ground during a CBRNE attack. Carriers should incorporate this training video into
crewmembers annual training syllabus.

                          TRAFFIC AND TERMINAL SERVICES

6.1. General. The broad aspects of traffic/terminal services include the receiving, processing,
documenting, loading/offloading of passengers and cargo, cabin servicing, preparing and
submitting necessary reports, maintaining records, and accomplishing other applicable tasks
contained in AMCI 24-101V14.
6.2. Traffic Function Responsibilities. During CRAF activation, responsibility for traffic
functions will be:
   6.2.1. Military Airfields. When military airfields are used by CRAF aircraft, services and
   equipment will be provided by the government as set forth in the AMC Airlift Services
   contract and this instruction. Arrangements for required contractual coverage are contained
   in the AMC Airlift Services contract.
   6.2.2. Civil Airfields. Each carrier is responsible for servicing their own aircraft at civil
   airfields. When required by AMC, TALCE teams will assist at civil airfields.
6.3. CRAF En Route Support.
   6.3.1. Movement on CRAF aircraft. CRAF carriers will move self-support personnel,
   equipment, and supplies aboard their own or other civil aircraft in accordance with
   contractual arrangements and current airlift contract. Three percent of the ACL on CRAF
   aircraft will be considered available for route support/resupply.
   6.3.2. Movement on Military Aircraft. CRAF carriers that are unable to move self-support
   personnel, equipment, and supplies aboard their own or other civil aircraft will request
   assistance from the AMC CRAF Cell, who in turn will coordinate with 618 TACC for
   support.
   6.3.3. Priorities. CRAF en route support traffic will be assigned the same movement priority
   as AMC en route support traffic.
6.4. Traffic Documentation and Procedures.
   6.4.1. Routing of Traffic Documents. All traffic moved on CRAF aircraft will be
   documented, processed, and forwarded by AMC personnel in the same manner as traffic
   moved on AMC aircraft.
   6.4.2. AMC Form 8, Civil Aircraft Certificate. The AMC Form 8, when properly
   completed, is the confirmation of airlift services rendered by a carrier. Information for the
   use of the AMC Form 8 is contained in AMCI 24-201 and the AMC Airlift Services contract.
6.5. Material Handling Equipment (MHE).
   6.5.1. The AMC CAT Logistics Cell will be responsible for assuring availability of adequate
   cargo and passenger MHE to support planned workload at all onload and offload locations.
   6.5.2. CRAF carriers may be tasked to provide wide-body MHE from their resources where
   compatible military equipment is not available.
       6.5.2.1. Positioning of carrier MHE will normally be the carrier's responsibility.
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 43


       6.5.2.2. AMC will transport and position MHE that exceeds the carrier's capability to
       position. HQ AMC/A3 may authorize transport of AMC-provided MHE on carrier
       missions on a case-by-case basis.
       6.5.2.3. Payment to carriers for use of carrier-provided MHE and equipment will be
       settled under the authority of the AMC Airlift Services contract.
6.6. Cargo Tie-down Policy. Military customer being moved is responsible for providing the
tie-down equipment for palletized and nonpalletized cargo. For nonpalletized cargo, AMC is
also responsible for providing pallets and couplers required for subflooring. AMC will provide
tie down required to secure nonpalletized loads to the aircraft. The carrier is responsible for
securing pallets to the aircraft.
6.7. Border Clearance Notification. It will be the responsibility of the AMC CAT to notify the
regional directors of Public Health, Immigrations, Customs, Agriculture, and the east and west
coast passport agencies that CRAF has been activated.
6.8. Pallet Configuration - Cargo Aircraft. See AMCPAM 24-2V1 for the most current
information.

                                          Chapter 8

                                    COMMUNICATIONS

Section 8A—Concept

8.1. General. This chapter establishes communication policies and procedures to be used
during the activation of the CRAF.
8.2. Activation of CRAF. Activation of the CRAF will require unsecure/secure communication
service between the AMC CAT and the carriers.

Section 8B—Operating Procedures

8.3. General. Use of Communications Equipment. CRAF aircraft should be equipped with
FAA/ICAO-required radios that are capable of communicating with all appropriate control
agencies. CRAF aircrews will use International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) procedures
unless otherwise instructed.
8.4. Communication Networks.
   8.4.1. Required Services. Reliable continuous communications service via telephone, STE,
   ARINC, and secure facsimile is necessary for CRAF operations. Additional point-to-point
   circuits essential to CRAF carrier operations will be provided by the carrier to include those
   required at mission support locations.
   8.4.2. Air-to-Ground:
       8.4.2.1. The primary facility for high frequency (HF) en route voice contact will be those
       civil facilities, which are presently used, e.g., ICAO, ARINC, or company commercial
       air/ground facilities.
       8.4.2.2. USAF High Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS) stations will
       be used as an alternate when civil facilities are not available. Frequencies for USAF
       HFGCS stations are listed in the current DOD Flight Information Handbook.
       8.4.2.3. Carrier aircraft will be capable of communicating with U.S. Air Force
       Communications Control Stations as outlined in the DOD Flight Information Handbook.
       8.4.2.4. Voice call signs for individual CRAF aircraft will be as directed by the AMC
       CAT.
   8.4.3. Point-to-Point:
       8.4.3.1. Civil communications networks currently in place will be used for
       communication between the AMC CAT and CRAF carrier operating bases.
       8.4.3.2. Military communications will be used as an alternate when civil communications
       are not available.
       8.4.3.3. CRAF aircraft movement messages will be transmitted in the clear.
       8.4.3.4. Classified messages will be transmitted over STE/secure facsimile equipment, or
       other secure equipment, as appropriate.
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   47


       8.4.3.5. ARINC message exchange between carriers and AMC CAT will be routed in
       accordance with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) airline seven-letter
       addresses and the ICAO/Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunications Network (AFTN)
       eight-letter address. These addresses are the central contact point at each location. Each
       addressee should establish procedures to ensure internal routing of all CRAF messages.
       These messages will be in the format applicable to the circuit over which the message is
       to be sent (e.g., ICAO/AFTN, commercial, IATA/airline, military.)
       8.4.3.6. When necessary, to relay messages between circuits which use different
       procedures, it will be accomplished through automated interchange between ARINC and
       the FAA-operated AFTN relay station (KMKM) at Kansas City MO.

Section 8C—Civil Communications Procedures

8.5. Purpose. These operating procedures apply to communications between HQ AMC and the
CRAF worldwide. They supplement existing Air Force directives where necessary. The
primary purpose of this section is to provide instructions for the benefit of Air Force personnel
accessing ARINC or AFTN.
8.6. Communications Systems.
   8.6.1. ARINC Electronic Switching System (ESS) is a high-speed message switching
   system. This system provides virtually worldwide telecommunications access through
   interconnects to most airlines. A message introduced at any airline point will automatically
   and speedily be routed via this system to any other airline point. Only unclassified messages
   will be sent via ARINC. HQ AMC is connected to the system, providing speedy access to
   almost all airline points, both domestic and international. For this reason, the ARINC ESS is
   specified as the primary path between and to the AMC CAT and most airline locations. The
   system routes messages on the basis of a seven-letter address code. Detailed procedures and
   format are in the ATA/IATA Interline Communication Manual and supplemental ARINC
   documentation, which the base communications center will maintain for use by the CRAF
   communications section.
       8.6.1.1. Equipment trouble on the ARINC ESS machine(s) must be reported immediately
       to the telephone company servicing the test center. Give the nature of the trouble and the
       circuit number.
       8.6.1.2. Maintain frequent status reports on trouble conditions and ensure that the CRAF
       communications supervisor on duty is aware that trouble exists.
       8.6.1.3. Upon restoration of service, advise CRAF communications supervisor and
       ensure that all affected messages are repeated and obtained.
   8.6.2. AFTN is a worldwide civil communications system of aeronautical point-to-point
   circuits used for the transmission of flight movement and control information. Entry to the
   AFTN from U.S. domestic communications systems is made at certain U.S. gateway
   locations and is done normally by ARINC ESS relaying such messages to the AFTN.

8.7. Secure Communications.
   8.7.1. All CRAF carrier operations centers and ISB sites will be equipped with a STU
   III/STE and secure facsimile machine to receive or transmit material up to the SECRET
   level.
   8.7.2. All CRAF carrier operations centers, ISB sites, and CRAF pilots may have secure
   communication data encryption devices issued to them, which will allow them to
   authenticate and pass encoded messages to AMC C2 agencies over VHF and HF radio
   frequencies, phone patch, or telephone.

Section 8D—Responsibilities

8.8. HQ AMC/A3A will arrange for, or ensure the provision of:
   8.8.1. Communications support for CRAF aircrews transiting bases under their jurisdiction.
   8.8.2. Control tower, approach control, ground control approach, and Airlift Control Center
   (ALCC) on bases or facilities under their control to retain VHF capability at frequency 139.0
   and below, because CRAF aircraft are not ultra high frequency (UHF) capable.
   8.8.3. Non-directional beacon, Very High Frequency Omni-directional Range and
   Instrument Landing System approaches for CRAF aircraft, because they are not equipped
   with navigational equipment to fly tactical air navigation approaches.
   8.8.4. Applicable operating instructions (OIs) during appropriate flight operation briefings.
   8.8.5. Communications, as required, to support the alternate AMC CAT in accordance with
   Chapter 3 of this instruction and Continuity of Operations Plan, Air Mobility Command.
   8.8.6. Commercial telephone numbers for military Tanker Airlift Control Element
   (TALCE)/load teams at all onload/offload locations.
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   49

Identification Cards for Members of the Uniformed Services, Their Eligible Family Members,
and other Eligible Personnel. The following information is not intended to limit the general
applicability of this requirement.
   9.5.1. General. Pertinent articles of the Geneva Conventions Relative to the Treatment of
   Prisoners of War, 12 August 1949, provide that GCCs should be issued to persons, who,
   because they are working for the DOD, may possibly be subject to becoming prisoners of
   war. In the event of capture, prisoners are bound to identify themselves by providing their
   name, rank, social security account number (SSAN), and date of birth to the capturing
   authority. GCCs shall in no case be taken from prisoners. Prisoners of war shall have
   identification documents on their person at all times.
   9.5.2. Personnel Authorized to Receive the GCC. CRAF carrier personnel, both U.S. and
   foreign nationals, authorized by the carrier to enter regions of war in performance of AMC
   Airlift Services contracts, will be issued this card. The bearer's SSAN will be entered on the
   front side of the DD Form 489 under SERVICE (see Attachment 3). The card will not make
   any reference to nationality. The GCC may be issued to the following company personnel:
       9.5.2.1. Aircrew personnel designated to operate company aircraft in the performance of
       peacetime DOD mission, as well as wartime airlift mission during CRAF activation.
       9.5.2.2. Ground support personnel assigned to support ISBs, to include indigenous
       personnel (non-U.S. citizens) already overseas.
       9.5.2.3. Selected supervisory personnel responsible for overall supervision of the
       company's participation in DOD peacetime airlift contract and activated CRAF
       operations.
   9.5.3. Issuing Cards: GCCs may be issued outside of CRAF activation at the company's
   discretion; however, during CRAF activation, cards will be completed and issued by
   company personnel within 48 hours or sooner upon notification from the CRAF Cell. See
   Attachment 3 for instructions on filling out cards.
   9.5.4. Control. Control of GCCs and issuance to air carriers are responsibilities of A3BC.
   The following procedures apply:
       9.5.4.1. Each CRAF carrier will maintain a minimal stock, as determined by the carrier,
       of blank cards on hand to meet typical needs. Requests for additional cards should be
       made to A3BC (by voice 618-229-1751, fax 618-256-6088, or e-mail).
       9.5.4.2. A3BC will forward the DD Forms 489, accompanied with an Accountable
       Receipt, by traceable method (i.e., FedEx, certified mail, etc.) to the carriers.
       9.5.4.3. The CRAF carrier will inventory the forms prior to signing for receipt of them
       on the enclosed receipt and is thereafter accountable for them. The signed receipt will be
       returned to A3BC.
   9.5.5. Responsible Company Agent. Each CRAF carrier will designate a company agent
   responsible for accountability, control, and issuing of the DD Form 489.

                                           Chapter 10

                               WAIVERS AND EXEMPTIONS

Section 10A—General

10.1. General. Certain FAR sections allow the administrator to issue a Certificate of Waiver, a
Certificate of Authorization, or operations specifications that authorize a deviation. These
actions permit a person or organization to either deviate from a specific regulation or comply
with special alternative provisions, conditions, or limitations. This regulatory flexibility is
available to the Administrator when the specific regulatory section stipulates that it is available.
When a regulatory section stipulates that a deviation is permitted, any person or organization
may apply for a deviation. Deviations may be granted and issued to operators conducting
operations under FAR Parts 121, 129, or 135. To apply for a deviation, an operator must submit
a specific request to the FAA. The application must generally be made by a letter that identifies
the specific regulatory guidance from which a deviation is requested.
   10.1.1. Deviations for Military Contract Operations.
       10.1.1.1. Section 40118 of Title 49, United States Code (U.S.C.) provides for the air
       transportation of government-financed passengers and property.            Normally, the
       transportation of government-financed passengers and property must be provided by air
       carrier certificate holders authorized to operate under FAR Part 121. FAR Part 121.57
       permits the administrator to authorize deviations to the applicable requirements of FAR
       Part 121, when necessary, so that operators may perform certain unique operations under
       military contract. Operators who determine that deviations from certain FAR Part 121
       requirements may be needed to operate under a DOD contingency plan must arrange with
       AMC to submit an application for deviation (application to amend operations
       specifications) on their behalf.
       10.1.1.2. If AMC elects to request such relief, it will submit an application on behalf of
       all affected operators, directly to the manager of the Air Transportation Division, AFS-
       200. AFS-200 will in turn provide a copy of each operator’s certificate-holding district
       office (CHDO). CHDO shall immediately advise its regional office that AMC, on behalf
       of the operator, has forwarded an application (for a deviation and amended operations
       specifications) to AFS-200. The CHDO shall analyze the request as soon as possible and
       forward its recommendation through the regional office by the most expeditious available
       means. These deviations are not applicable until FAA has issued formal approval.
       10.1.1.3. When the nature of a crisis does not permit adequate time to obtain deviations
       in accordance with the above guidance, AMC may obtain immediate relief on behalf of
       all affected operators, from specific FAR Part 121 requirements via direct telecon or
       facsimile with AFS-200. CHDOs will be notified of this relief as soon as possible.
   10.1.2. The subsequent sections of this chapter list possible FAR Part 121 requirements that
   may require relief during CRAF operations. This list is not intended to be all-inclusive, nor
   does it prevent relief from other applicable FAR Part 121, 129, or 135 requirements should
   the need arise.

Operations Conducted Under FAR Part 121 or Part 135 of this Chapter

10.2. FAR 119. 49. Contents of Operations Specifications. Overhaul and inspection time
limitations may be increased up to a maximum of 25 percent above the time limitations shown
on the specifications. Such time limitation increases may be used only if the circumstances
provide no alternative to continue operation.

Section 10C—Approval of Routes: Domestic and Flag Air Carriers

10.3. FAR 121. 93. Route Requirements: General. The carrier may conduct operations over
routes and into areas without listing such routes or areas in its approved operations
specifications, or be required to show that it is competent to operate over such routes or into such
areas.
10.4. FAR 121. 101. Weather Reporting Facilities. If weather information required by this
section is not available, the carrier may use any appropriate weather data prepared by the
military.

Section 10D—Approval of Areas and Routes for Supplemental Air Carriers and Commercial
Operators

10.5. FAR 121. 113. Area and Route Requirements: General. The carrier may conduct
operations over routes and into areas, while not listing such routes or areas in its approved
operations specifications, or be required to show that it is competent to operate over such routes
or into such areas.
10.6. FAR 121. 119. Weather Reporting Facilities. If weather information required by this
section is not available, the carrier may use any appropriate weather data prepared by the
military.
10.7. FAR 121. 125. Flight Following System. The carrier may conduct flights, which are not
monitored in accordance with the requirements of this section.

Section 10E—Aircraft Requirements

10.8. FAR 121. 161. Airplane Limitations: Type of Route. The operator may operate any
extended range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) -capable airplane in an
approved geographical area over a route that contains a point farther than 1 hour, but not farther
than the operators FAA ETOPS-approved flight time limitation (in still air at normal cruise speed
with one engine inoperative) from an adequate airport.
10.9. FAR 121. 163. Aircraft Proving Tests. The operator need not conduct proving tests
required by this section, unless an authorized representative of the FAA specifically requires it
and notifies the operator in writing.

Section 10F—Aircraft Instrument and Equipment Requirements

10.10. FAR 121. 303. Instruments and Equipment. Components and parts approved by the
military will be considered as approved parts for the purpose of meeting the requirements of this
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   55


section and 121.605, provided they are compatible with the aircraft components and systems and

specified by the military in accordance with appropriate military directives may be used for
compliance.

Section 10L—Request for FAR Deviation for Aeromedical Evacuation Aircraft

10.18. General. It is requested that the FAA authorize deviations to the following sections of
FAR Part 121, in order to operate the CRAF AESS on Boeing 767 series aircraft.
10.19. FAR 121. 157. Aircraft Certification and Equipment Requirements. Reason for
deviation: The operation of CRAF AESS may not comply with those sections pertaining to a
transport category airplane, e.g., berths, Section 25.785; passenger information signs (litter
patients only), Section 25.803; general illumination light levels (litters may cause shadowing),
Section 25.812 (c) and (d); compartment interiors, Section 25.853; safety belts (litter patients
only), Section 25.1413(b), (c) and (d); and automatic presentation of oxygen masks (litter
patients only), Section 25.1447(c)(1). When installed on CRAF AE missions, litters will serve as
a means for the occupants to steady themselves while using the aisles. If litters are not installed,
occupants may use litter arms to steady themselves while using the aisles. Litters do not have
padded end boards or canvas diaphragms to prevent forward movement of litter patients;
however, litters do have a minimum of two straps to help prevent patients from moving forward
in the litter. Additionally, patients are briefed to assume a litter crash position in the event of an
emergency landing. Passenger service units will be positioned to ensure that oxygen masks will
drop and be accessible to litter patients. Passenger service units which will be obstructive or
inaccessible to medical crewmembers, litter patients, or ambulatory patients will be disabled.
The design of the CRAF AESS allows for lengthening of all oxygen hoses for operational
passenger service units in order that the bottom litter patient is able to receive emergency
oxygen. The pre-takeoff briefing to passengers will inform the top litter patient to pass the
unused oxygen hoses to the lower litter patients. Flight attendants and medical crewmembers
will ensure compliance and availability of emergency oxygen to all patients.
10.20. FAR 121. 291. Demonstration of Emergency Evacuation Procedures (litter patients
only). Reason for deviation. The CRAF AESS is intended to carry a maximum 87 litters on
Boeing 767 aircraft during wartime conditions. In addition to FAA required flight attendants,
AMC will provide 10 medical crewmembers to care for patients during flight. AMCs experience
in AE operations has demonstrated it would be impossible to evacuate all litter and ambulatory
patients from the aircraft in 90 seconds. This risk is acceptable to AMC under wartime
conditions.
10.21. FAR 121. 310(c)(2) and (3). Lighting For Interior Emergency Exit Markings. Once
litters are installed on the aircraft, they may cause shadows that result in noncompliance with this
FAR. The certificate holder must have approved procedures for cabin occupants other than non-
ambulatory patients to aide them in recognizing emergency exits during an emergency
evacuation. A briefing describing these procedures shall be included in the passenger briefing
required by 14 Code of Federal Regulation (14 CFR), Section 121.571. Medical crewmembers
and flight attendants will be required to carry flashlights for in-flight use to observe patients as
necessary.
10.22. FAR 121. 311(a) and (b). Seats, Safety Belts, and Shoulder Harnesses (carry-on
litters may not support the required loads). Reason for deviation: Government provided
litters do not meet the FAA requirement for an approved seat or berth. Litters will be the same
 58                                                         AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011


as they are in current operation on AMC aircraft on AE missions. These litters will be used for
wartime operations. Litters do have straps to secure patients in-flight. No conclusive tests have
been conducted to determine if the litters will meet FAA crash-worthiness requirements.
10.23. FAR 121. 312. Materials for Compartment Interiors. Reason for deviation. Heat-
release applies to the nurse workstation of the CRAF AESS. The nurse workstation, as presently
proposed, meets 25.583 (a) requirements. The installation of the CRAF AESS will not remove
any of an aircraft's existing heat-release protection. The AESS installation does not degrade the
heat-release protection already existing in the aircraft. The requirement to heat-release the nurse
workstation will provide limited additional passenger/patient protection in a cabin fire
emergency scenario. The CRAF AESS installs two nurse workstations. The nurse workstation
is an isolated furniture item, surrounded by government furnished litters, which are not FAA
approved. Government provided litters are the same as in current operation on AMC aircraft AE
missions. These same litters will be used for wartime operations. Litters are made of canvas
with wooden or metal handles. Additionally, each litter patient will have padding on his/her
litter for patient comfort. To reduce hazards, no smoking is permitted during AE operations.
10.24. FAR 121. 317(a) and (f). Passenger Information. Reason for deviation. Due to the
unique nature of the AE mission, AE crewmembers (AECMs) may need to attend to patient care
needs during phases of flight (takeoff, en route cruise, and landing) when the fasten seat belt sign
is illuminated. This is a common practice on AMC AE missions. AECMs are secured to the
litter stanchion with a strap to reduce risk of uncontrolled movement in the cabin. This is not a
method to gain additional seating capacity. If patients do not need attention, AECMs will be
seated when the seat belt sign is illuminated. In addition, passenger information signs may not
be visible to all litter patients. Accordingly, announcements will be made on the public address
system to inform these patients to return to their place and fasten their restraining strap. There
will be no smoking allowed on AE missions. Flight attendants or medical crewmembers will
ensure compliance.
10.25. FAR 121. 547. Admission to Flight Deck. In certain instances, an individual from the
medical crew may need to discuss an emergency medical situation with ground personnel using
the aircraft radio. Relaying this critical information through the pilot may lead to possible
misinterpretation of essential information. Therefore, should an individual from the medical
crew require access to the flight deck, they will first obtain the approval of the pilot in command
to ensure safety is not jeopardized during a critical phase of flight, and once access is granted
they will work with the pilots to complete these radio transmissions as quickly as possible.
Except in emergencies and unless otherwise authorized, individuals requesting access to the
flight deck will possess a current FAA Form 110A/110B or Admission to the Flight Deck, signed
by a company representative and issued by the Administrator (FAA). The pilot in command is
the final arbiter of access to the flight deck. Medical personnel will return to the cabin as soon as
their transactions are complete.
10.26. FAR 121. 571(a) (3). Briefing Passengers Before Take-off. Reason for deviation.
This section requires that each passenger who may need assistance to move expeditiously to an
exit, and his/her attendant be individually briefed by the flight attendant on emergency
evacuation procedures. Due to the large number of passengers who may need assistance, this
will be impractical. AMC will accept a single briefing, which describes emergency evacuation
procedures for all passengers.
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                     59


10.27. FAR 121. 574(c). Oxygen For Medical Use by Passengers. Reason for deviation.
The CRAF AESS allows for the carriage of USAF supplied portable oxygen bottles. These
bottles may be used by patients should primary patient oxygen systems be inoperative or by
medical crewmembers in the event of a condition requiring use of supplemental oxygen. An
oxygen recharger line, similar in design to that on USAF aircraft, is located at each nurse work
station. It may be necessary to refill empty oxygen bottles from one of the recharging lines in-
flight with passengers on board. All AE crewmembers are trained in this procedure on USAF
aircraft.
10.28. FAR 121. 585. Exit Row Seating. Reason for deviation. The CRAF AESS is designed
to maximize litter evacuation capability. It would significantly degrade the capability of the
aircraft to limit seating/berthing near the exits to those who meet the requirements of this
paragraph. The CRAF AESS is designed so that no exits or escape paths are blocked.
Aeromedical crewmembers are trained on USAF aeromedical evacuation aircraft to aid those
who need assistance to evacuate the aircraft.
10.29. FAR 121. 589. Carry-on Baggage. Reason for deviation. AE crews carry on
approximately 1,000 pounds of medical equipment and supplies in addition to personal baggage.
Critical Care Air Transport Teams, specialized AE crews, may add an additional 2,000 pounds of
medical equipment and supplies. The medical equipment and supplies are contained in large
coolers and boxes and are essential for in-flight patient care. This equipment will be accounted
for on the manifest, securely fastened with tie-down straps during flight to prevent uncontrolled
movement, and will not block emergency exits at any time.

   11.6.2. Military Base Commander. CRAF aircraft at military installations will receive the
   same degree of physical security as provided military aircraft in like status. Ingress and
   egress procedures to and through control points and restricted or controlled areas will be
   established to permit CRAF crews access to their aircraft and bases.
11.7. Authority for Access to Classified Documents.
   11.7.1. Authority to Handle Authenticator Material. CRAF flight deck aircrew members
   may require certain authentication systems in order to perform CRAF missions. When
   needed, these documents will be made available at military airfields to flight deck aircrew
   members possessing a SECRET clearance.
   11.7.2. Authority for Access to Safe Passage Procedures. NORAD Regulations 55-67 (S)
   and 55-68 (S), provide the safe passage procedures for CRAF aircraft departing from and
   returning to the CONUS. Upon activation of CRAF and when required by NORAD,
   flightdeck aircrew members, having been granted a secret security clearance by the TCCC,
   are authorized access to the NORAD Safe Passage Procedures for aircraft that are offshore
   when Stage III of CRAF is activated.
11.8. Classified Guidance.
   11.8.1. Providing Security Classification Guidance:
      11.8.1.1. TCAQ will incorporate the classified guidance in this instruction into the AMC
      Airlift Services contract as part of Appendix 5.
      11.8.1.2. A3BC will provide CRAF classification guidance to TCAQ through
      submission of a DD Form 254, DOD Contract Security Classification Specification. This
      form will be made a part of the AMC Airlift Services contract.
      11.8.1.3. A3BC will also provide to TCAQ, upon request, classification guidance to
      support the DD Form 254 submission for peacetime DOD airlift operations.
      11.8.1.4. HQ AMC/SFOI will coordinate all security items, to include the DD Form 254,
      prior to submission to TCAQ.
   11.8.2. Reviewing Security Classification Guidance. A3BC will review the security
   classification guidance, contained in the DD Form 254, in January of each year for the next
   fiscal year contract and notify TCAQ of the results of that review. When there is a change in
   the security classification guidance, TCAQ will inform the contractor. The cognizant
   security office shall be furnished a copy of all notification or reclassification actions.
11.9. Personnel Security Clearance Authorization.
   11.9.1. General. Authority for carriers to certify the personnel security clearance status of
   company employees is contained in the NISPOM, DOD 5220.22M. This reference makes
   provisions for the carrier who has a valid facility security clearance of SECRET to verify the
   security clearance status of its employees.
   11.9.2. Security Clearance Identification. This AMC Instruction is the basis for satisfying
   the peacetime and wartime security clearance requirements. Contract airlift flight deck
   aircrew personnel, who possess an active security clearance, may be required to provide
   protective and signature security services in support of peacetime airlift requirements.
   During CRAF activation, flight deck aircrew personnel may be required to provide protective
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                      65


   and signature security services in support of wartime airlift requirements. A valid passport or
   company ID card, either of which has a picture of the bearer, will provide sufficient
   identification for releasing SECRET material to cleared CRAF personnel.
   11.9.3. Security Clearance Verification of Flight Deck Aircrews. During a CRAF activation,
   the CRAF carrier will put the security access information on the flight release form. Carriers
   may use company formats, but will ensure that security access statements are clear and
   unambiguous. An example of a proper statement is ―SECRET security access current and
   valid for Ira A. Eaker, James J. Doolittle, and Amelia N. Earhart.‖
   11.9.4. Security Clearance Confirmation. If validity of the clearance status or the identity of
   the bearer is questioned, confirmation may be obtained by contacting the appropriate CRAF
   carrier's company security officer. Should this situation arise when CRAF is activated and
   the carrier security officer cannot be contacted, the questioner may contact the DSSCO;
   current telephone numbers are DSN 695-2265 or 614-236-2133 during duty hours and 614-
   236-2058 after duty hours.
   11.9.5. Facility (company) Security Officer's (FSO) Responsibility. The FSO will maintain
   a current list of company personnel with U.S. Secret clearances and cockpit aircrew
   personnel who are eligible to receive a secret clearance. These lists will be verified during
   on-site surveys by inspectors of the DOD Commercial Airlift Division.
   11.9.6. Military Base Commanders. All CRAF carrier personnel, after proper clearance
   verification or confirmation and after proper identification by means of a valid passport or
   company ID card, any of which has a picture of the bearer, are authorized to have access and
   receive classified material as necessary to support the DOD airlift mission. Additionally,
   each individual who is listed with the FSO and Defense Investigative Security Clearance
   Office and has been the subject of at least a National Agency Check may be issued a
   restricted area badge in accordance with AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program
   Management, Chapter 3.
11.10. Authentication Materials. Authentication materials and IFF/SIF OIs will be made
available to CRAF cockpit aircrew members at military airfield operations and ISBs (as
necessary). Initial issue of these documents will be as required to cover elapsed time from
departure station to destination and return, or to the first en route station with the capability to
provide additional distribution.
11.11. Classified/Unclassified Operations Briefing. An operations briefing, including security
and communications, will be the responsibility of AMC.
11.12. Handling of Classified Material. In addition to the briefing outlined in paragraph 11.11
above, the briefing officer will ensure the aircraft captain or first officer is aware of the
following:
   11.12.1. Receipt for Classified Material. The contents of the briefing envelope contain
   information affecting the national defense of the United States and is issued for use while
   flying. Part of this information is classified and extreme care should be exercised to preclude
   its being compromised. Upon terminating the flight, all material will be given to the military
   airfield operations officer or destroyed in accordance with paragraph 11.12.2 below. All
   classified material will be accounted for by means of the AF Form 310, Document Receipt
   and Destruction Certificate, or a comparable hand receipt. Prior to accepting material, the

   aircraft captain should ensure that sufficient legible copies of the receipt form are available to
   allow one copy for the recipient at the destination and one copy for the aircraft captain's
   personal file.
   11.12.2. Destruction of Classified Material. In the event of an emergency where it appears
   that classified material cannot be protected, it will be burned or destroyed by other means, to
   render recognition impossible. In this event, complete the destruction certificate on the SF
   153 or AF Form 310. Provide a copy of this form to the issuing office and retain one copy to
   be held for the required 2 years.
11.13. Facility Security Officer. The CRAF carrier FSO, who should be contacted for security
clearance verifications, is normally available in the office during the hours of 0900-1700. In
some instances, a switchboard can connect you with the FSO.
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  67

                                      COMPTROLLER

12.1. General. AFI 10-213, Comptroller Operations under Emergency Conditions gives
guidance for comptroller (HQ AMC/A8) operations under emergency and general war conditions
when the CRAF is activated.
12.2. Budget Concept. Airlift contracts provide for payment of personnel and airlift during all
stages of CRAF activation. Budgeting and funding procedures for contract airlift services, which
are in effect at the time of activation, will be continued. Budgeting and funding are the
responsibility of HQ AMC/FM.
12.3. Contracting for Airlift. Delivery orders issued to CRAF carriers by the AMC contracting
officer are based on a Request for Procurement of Commercial Airlift (AF Form 9). The director
of industrial fund, HQ AMC/FMAI, will certify fund availability on the Form 9 or issue an
obligation authority to HQ AMC/A3.

   medical equipment must be tested, deemed airworthy, and approved for use by HQ AMC
   guidance. Equipment not approved for in-flight use on B-767s will undergo an operational
   checkout IAW the aircraft supplemental flight manual procedures provided by the
   government in the CRAF AESS packaging.
13.3. Execution of Flight.
   13.3.1. CRAF AE B-767s will be used to return AECMs, CCATT, and medical equipment
   from CONUS AE hubs to overseas AE hubs.
   13.3.2. Refueling should normally be accomplished prior to enplaning patients; however, if
   this is not possible, an emergency crash/rescue vehicle will be required to stand by the
   aircraft during concurrent servicing IAW T.O. 00-25-172. When patients are onboard the
   aircraft, the aircraft captain will request, through the command post at military airfields,
   crash/rescue support prior to taxi, takeoff, landing, or aircraft servicing of fuel or LOX.
   13.3.3. The aircraft captain and air carrier dispatcher are responsible for mission
   management and will contact the MCD for a briefing on medical requirements. This will be
   accomplished 30 minutes prior to takeoff. The following information will be requested and
   provided:

       will be collected and stored separately from common waste.
   13.3.6. Should the medical condition of any patient require attention during takeoff, en route
   cruise or landing, and if the seat belt sign is on, AECMs will be secured with straps to the
   litter and remain standing during these phases of flight.
   13.3.7. AECMs will assist flight attendants and flight crew during aircraft emergencies,
   including the deplaning of patients during an emergency.
       13.3.7.1. Low-pressure, portable oxygen bottles will be available for each AECM for use
       during emergencies. These bottles will be provided by AMC when available and will be
       stored behind the nurses’ workstation and within reach of each AECM-designated seat.
   13.3.8. Should an en route aircraft diversion be required for reasons other than a medical
   emergency, the aircraft captain will coordinate with the MCD, when possible, before
   deciding the point of landing. The welfare of the patients is a prime consideration in all such
   decisions; however, safety is the final determinant. The C2 will be advised and guidance
   requested for all aircraft or medical emergencies, which require diversions.
   13.3.9. In matters of flight safety, decisions of the carrier operations personnel are final. In
   matters of all patient care, decisions of MCD are final.
   13.3.10. The carrier flight attendant personnel will accomplish the following duties:

       medical crew will designate which patients can or cannot receive meals or beverages.
13.4. Aircraft Identification. The aircraft shall use the call sign of "Air Evac" for all scheduled
flights.
13.5. Configuration Changes. Configuration Control: the contractor will provide information
on aircraft configuration changes, which affect the ability to install the CRAF AESS on
designated aircraft to HQ AMC/SG.
13.6. Mission Scheduling. The 618 TACC Aeromedical Operations Division is responsible for
scheduling all CRAF AE missions. The AE Ops Division receives requirements from
USTRANSCOM, and will work closely with the AMC CRAF Cell to ensure that the CRAF
resources are properly allocated.
 72                                                     AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011


                                        Chapter 14

                             CRAF EXERCISE PROGRAM

14.1. Purpose. The CRAF Exercise Program ensures the readiness of HQ AMC and
USTRANSCOM staff to competently activate and deactivate the CRAF. As stated in AMCI 10-
204, Air Mobility Command Exercise Program, exercises ―enhance readiness, boost combat
capability, streamline procedures, and identify weaknesses. A regular cycle of planning,
exercising, and reviewing lessons learned will keep AMC prepared for meeting wartime and
contingency commitments.‖
14.2. Organization. For the purposes of this instruction, there are two types of CRAF
exercises: AMC CAT exercises and A3BC tabletop reviews.
   14.2.1. AMC CAT Exercises. As part of larger exercises involving HQ AMC, the CRAF
   office will routinely receive exercise injects involving CRAF questions or issues.
   Occasionally, these exercises will include CRAF activation and A3BC and other staff
   functions (TCAQ, TACC, and TCJ5) are tasked to perform in a well-coordinated and timely
   fashion.
   14.2.2. A3BC Tabletop Reviews. Many of the tasks for CRAF activation are not part of
   day-to-day HQ AMC activity. Further, the continual turnover in military personnel means
   perpetual loss of experience from previous exercises. Therefore, experience shows that
   smooth execution of CRAF wartime tasks depends upon A3BC conducting annual reviews
   with relevant staff functions in AMC and USTRANSCOM. This review may be done at any
   time during the year, but ideally should be within 2-6 months prior to the annual AMC CAT
   exercise, normally held in the spring.
      14.2.2.1. Recommended format and topics. A tabletop format is conducive to learning
      and facilitates both discussion and questions from participants. Topics for discussion
      should always include any lessons learned from previous exercises. Review of such
      lessons learned can spur process improvements and help avoid likely pitfalls in upcoming
      exercises. Additional topics include activation procedures or any other issues likely to
      arise during the exercise (communication channels, message handling, etc.)
      14.2.2.2. Recommended participants. Consider inviting representatives from 618 TACC,
      HQ AMC/A3X, TCAQ, TCJ3, TCJ5, and/or Fusion Center.

                                  NAVIGATION ROUTE KIT

A2.1. This attachment provides information needed for receipt and management of the CRAF
navigation route kit (NRK).
A2.2. A NRK, which is made up of DOD Flight Information Publications (FLIP) (navigation
maps and charts, terminal information, en route publications, etc.), provides navigation coverage
for specific CRAF Segments, is necessary for operating DOD missions, and should be used
during CRAF activation. An air carrier operating in any of the three segments of CRAF is
authorized to receive a NRK provided by the Government. FLIP, which are produced by the
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and distributed by the Defense Logistics
Agency (DLA), provide appropriate area coverage as follows:
   A2.2.1. International Segment (long- and short-range) - Global.
   A2.2.2. Aeromedical Evacuation Segment - Global.
   A2.2.3. National Segment - Continental United States, Alaska, and Distant Early Warning
   Line. Note: Military navigation aids required during peacetime are also required during
   CRAF activation.
A2.3. FLIP requirements and distribution.
   A2.3.1. A3B is responsible for establishing the FLIP/Kits requirement (type and quantity)
   for each CRAF carrier. The type of FLIP is based on the segment(s) of CRAF the carrier is
   in. The number of kits a carrier is authorized is based on the number of aircraft the carrier has
   in CRAF plus one kit for use in the carrier’s flight operations dispatch area.
   A2.3.2. The minimum number of kits the carrier must maintain is two (one for an aircraft
   and one for flight operations dispatch). The maximum number of kits a carrier is authorized
   to receive will not be more than the number of aircraft they have in CRAF and the one for
   flight operations.
   A2.3.3. Before the start of the new contract period, A3B must send a letter to DLA/DSCR-
   JNAB, listing the carriers and the number of kits required for each. The carrier may contact
   DLA to increase or decrease the number of kits it is receiving. However, the carrier must
   maintain the required minimum. To adjust the number of kits it is receiving or to request
   replacement items required for each kit, the carrier must contact the DLA CRAF FLIP
   accounts manager at (800) 826-0342 or FAX at (804) 279-6524, and provide its FLIP
   account number, along with a positive address where the shipment of FLIP will be received.
A2.4. FLIP (NRKs) that are placed aboard aircraft must be maintained in heavy-duty type bags
or cases, which are procured through local sources at the carrier's expense.
A2.5. The CRAF carrier will maintain all NRKs provided by the Government in a current status.
Upon receipt of FLIP, to include changes, outdated FLIP will be removed and discarded.
A2.6. CRAF carriers are authorized to use the FLIP during peacetime commercial or military
contract operations; however, they must still be maintained in a ready status at all times for the
appropriate area coverage to support CRAF activation.
A2.7. Carrier Responsibilities.
AMCI10-402 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  77


   A2.7.1. Advise A3B of needs and requirements. One kit for each CRAF allocated aircraft,
   plus one for carrier flight operations dispatch.
   A2.7.2. Maintain appropriate records to ensure that all kits are current.
   A2.7.3. Ensure that each aircraft is provided an appropriate NRK in accordance with the
   number of aircraft allocated to CRAF by USDOT/RSPA (OET).
   A2.7.4. Periodically review FLIP requirements and advise A3B of necessary changes.
   A2.7.5. When quantity adjustments need to be made, write the DLA CRAF FLIP account
   manager at DSCR-JNAB, 8000 Jefferson Davis Highway, Richmond VA 23297-5335, fax
   804-279-6524, or call 800-826-0342 or 804-279-6534.
A2.8. DLA Responsibilities. DLA/DSCR-JNAB is responsible for forwarding FLIP to
appropriate CRAF carrier addresses, using the periodic update provided by A3BC.
A2.9. AMC Responsibilities.
   A2.9.1. AMC/A6OB will make AMCI 10-402 available on publicly accessible worldwide
   web address.
   A2.9.2. A3B will:
       A2.9.2.1. Provide NGA/EDPA and DLA/DSCR-JNAB with a copy of the current CRAF
       Capability Summary (AMC HQ Form 312). This form provides the total number of
       aircraft allocated by OET (by type, carrier, and segment) as of the 1st day of the month,
       and is provided for information only.
       A2.9.2.2. Conduct an annual survey of CRAF carriers FLIP and chart requirements and
       current mailing address.
       A2.9.2.3. Advise DLA/DSCR-JNAB annually (October) of the updated CRAF
       requirements.
A2.10. International and AE Segments requirements. The NRK for the International (long- and
short-range) and AE Segments will contain one copy of all FLIP for worldwide coverage and the
Foreign Clearance Guide, which can be obtained via the worldwide web at
http://www.fcg.pentagon.mil.
A2.11. National Segment, Domestic Section. The NRK for the Domestic Section of the
National Segment will contain one copy of all FLIP covering CONUS, Canada, and Mexico.
A2.12. National Segment, Alaska Section. The NRK for the Alaska Section of the National
Segment will contain one copy of all FLIP covering Alaska, CONUS, and Canada.
   A2.12.1. DOD Aeronautical Charts Bulletin Digest (one copy per addressee).
