1. General: Commanders will ensure compliance with this instruction and supply guidance as
required for maintaining proper integrity and eliminating abuse.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. The Flight Chief of the fabricating activity has local manufacture (LM) approval
     authority for:
        2.1.1. Stock listed items coded for LM (Source of Supply [SOS] JBD or Illustrated Parts
        Breakdown Source Maintenance Repair [SMR] Code MF* or AF* with acquisition
        advice code [AAC] F).
        2.1.2. Non-stock listed items to be made per technical order (TO)/drawing specification.
     2.2. 374 MXG/CC (or representative designated in writing) has LM approval authority for:
        2.2.1. Stock listed items not coded for LM (not SOS JBD or SMR Code Manufactured or
        fabricated at intermediate level [MF*]).
        2.2.2. Non-stock listed items to be made per other than technical order/drawing
        specification.
     2.3. The section Non-Commissioned Officer In-Charge (NCOIC) has approval authority for
     LM requests (other than LM tools) required to facilitate their own section’s production.
     Maintenance performed by these sections requires extensive use of custom made templates,
     patterns, forming and holding fixtures, hardware extraction/installation tools and alignment
     devices on a routine basis. Manufacture of these items is covered in their technical training,
     Career Development Course books, general methods and procedural TO (reference AFI 21-
     101, paragraph 11.19.) and do not require LM paperwork.
     2.4. LM of munitions related items and equipment must be processed and approved IAW
     AFI 21-101, Chapters 4, 7, and 16.
     2.5. Tools requiring LM will be approved by the 374 MXG Quality Assurance Office IAW
     AFI 21-101 and 374 MXG OI 21-124.
     2.6. MICAP LMs do not follow the procedures listed in this document. All MICAP requests
     must be processed IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11, Attachment 11C13.
3. Requesting Activity will:
     3.1. Research item requiring LM and ensure it cannot be obtained through normal supply
     channels. If item can be ordered, it will be placed on order with appropriate priority. The
     supply document number associated with this transaction will be required when processing
     LM request. When requesting items, approval will not be granted solely on local
     procurement versus material costs or availability through normal supply channels. Man
     hours required to complete the project and equipment availability will also be considered
     during approval process.
     3.2. Complete a YOKOTA AB Form 36 (Attachment 2) and submit through the appropriate
     agency.
     3.3. Create and load a work order in GO81 or the Integrated Maintenance Data System
     (IMDS) for production tracking and documentation against the LM. If more than one shop is
     involved in the manufacture process, a work order will be created for each work center.
YOKOTAABI23-125 13 MAY 2013                                                                      3


   3.4. Provide the following supporting documentation to FSC:
      3.4.1. Approved LM request form (YOKOTA AB 36).
      3.4.2. DD Form 1348-6, Single Line Item Requisition System Document, AF Form 2005,
      Issue/Turn-In Request, AF Form 601 (if required), Equipment Action Request.
      3.4.3. Applicable drawings/blueprints/depot guidance/copies of technical orders or
      reference specifications for the requested LM. These items may be found in the
      Integrated Electronic Technical Manual System (IETMS), the Joint Engineering Data
      Management Information and Control System (JEDMICS), or obtained from local Air
      Force Engineering Technical Service (AFETS) representatives.
      3.4.4. Supply/purchase order documents for materials needed for the LM (may include
      raw materials, hardware, and/or tooling).
      3.4.5. Paper copies of GO81 or IMDS work order(s) for LM.
   3.5. Route supporting documentation to the manufacturing work center and appropriate
   approving official(s) as identified in paragraphs 2.1. and 2.2.
4. Manufacturing Activity will:
   4.1. Verify ability to fabricate the requested LM. A fabricating section 7-level will verify
   ability to manufacture and consult with requester concerning possibilities of LM, assist in
   design of item, determine material specifications if not already designated in technical data or
   like specifications, and determine proper quantity of materials/consumable parts needed. If
   the requester already has a LM form (YOKOTA AB 36) available, annotate any pertinent
   information and refer to FSC if manufacture is possible. Price of the item will be based on
   availability of material and not total cost of item.
   4.2. Execute requested LM. Once paperwork is approved and materials/consumables
   received, completion of item will be based upon priority requested. Items with same
   priorities, work requests are accomplished in the order received unless instructed otherwise
   by fabricating activity’s supervision.
   4.3. Contact the 374 LRS Flight Service Center (FSC) upon completion of LMs and forward
   property for receipt processing.
5. Supply Procedures for Local Manufacture:
   5.1. The normal procedure for requesting a LM item is for the requesting activity to submit
   the request through the LRS/Supply activity. However, there are situations where the LM
   item request does not have to be processed through the LRS/Supply activity.
   5.2. 374 LRS (FSC) will appoint, in writing, a primary and alternate Local Manufacture
   Manager. The LM Manager will:
      5.2.1. Create a file of all LM requests. Folders should contain the following:
          5.2.1.1. Approved LM requests (YOKOTA AB 36).
          5.2.1.2. Applicable drawings/blueprints/depot guidance/copies of technical orders or
          reference specifications for the requested LMs.
          5.2.1.3. Supply/purchase order documents for materials/consumable parts.

            5.2.1.4. Paper copies of IMDS work orders for LMs.
        5.2.2. Process documents IAW AFMAN 23-110 for all LMs submitted. These will
        include at a minimum:
            5.2.2.1. Approved LM request (YOKOTA AB 36).
            5.2.2.2. DD Form 1348-6, AF Forms 601 or 2005.
            5.2.2.3. Applicable drawings/blueprints/depot guidance/copies of technical orders or
            reference specifications for the requested LM.
            5.2.2.4. Paper copies of IMDS work order(s) for LM.
        5.2.3. If the requested LM item is not stock listed, work with Customer Service
        personnel to assign an ERRCD and a locally assigned stock number after the 1348-6
        paperwork is completed.
        5.2.4. Assist in verifying parts availability.
            5.2.4.1. If parts are available, bits and pieces along with all paperwork will be
            forwarded to the repair section for manufacture.
            5.2.4.2. If parts are not available and the requirement is MICAP the FSC local
            manufacture manager will input the bits and pieces requirements with TEX “7”;
            appropriate MICAP UJC; JCN in the work-order field, aircraft tail number (SRD and
            WUC) in the mark-for, and notify the AFGLSC who will accomplish MICAP
            verification and requisition processes.
                5.2.4.2.1. To complete the MICAP process, when bits and pieces are received
                they will be released to the appropriate repair shop for manufacture of the item.
                5.2.4.2.2. The request for the LM item will remain on order until the item is
                complete and received by Supply for REC/DOR processing.
            5.2.4.3. For non-MICAP requirements, the FSC LM manager will back order the
            requirements with the appropriate UJC and JCN in the work order field.
        5.2.5. Once all paperwork is completed and all bits and pieces are received/available,
        forward all items needed for the LM to the repair section for manufacture.
     5.3. If the requested LM item is beyond base maintenance capability to manufacture,
     maintenance personnel will return the work order request with the reason for non-
     manufacture to Stock Control.
        5.3.1. Stock Control will cancel the LM due-in detail record and assign REX code “2”.
     5.4. Upon completion of manufacture the finished product will be forwarded back to FSC
     for REC/DOR processing, and then issued to the customer.
6. Local Manufacture of Aircraft Components and Hardware:
     6.1. Aircraft components, assemblies, and hardware requiring LM fall into two categories:
        6.1.1. Items coded as LM per applicable TO guidance have automatic approval and may
        be locally manufactured without additional authority beyond the TO. Paperwork shall
        still be routed as identified in paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of this instruction.
YOKOTAABI23-125 13 MAY 2013                                                                   5


     6.1.2. Items that have other SMR codes may be locally manufactured providing the
     following two conditions are met:
         6.1.2.1. The SMR code does not specifically prohibit LM.
         6.1.2.2. Manufacture can be accomplished without deviation from technical
         drawings, blueprints, equipment technical directives or covered under applicable
         general maintenance practices and within the capabilities of the primary work center.
  6.2. Procurable assets may be approved by the 374 MXG/CC or designated representative.
  Procurable assets will only be locally manufactured when normal procurement will result in
  unacceptable mission impact as determined by the production superintendent. Example:
  Part is SMR-Coded PAA, without a favorable EDD, fabricating activity has all capabilities to
  manufacture IAW technical drawings, blueprints, equipment technical directives or covered
  under applicable general maintenance practices and within the capabilities of the primary
  work center. Approval authority is 374 MXG/CC or designated representative.
     6.2.1. Requesting activity will contact COSO or MSL to initiate procedures listed in
     paragraph 3.
     6.2.2. Identify and coordinate LM request to 374 MXG/CC or designated representative
     for approval.
  6.3. Items identified with a restrictive SMR code will not be manufactured without approval
  of Depot Engineering. As per paragraph 6.4., submit request for applicable procedures to
  seek approval following guidance listed in TO 00-25-107.
  6.4. Assets requiring modification or deviation from applicable technical guidance must be
  approved by Depot Engineering via TO 00-25-107 request, submitted in AIRCAT in which
  case engineering disposition, blueprint or drawing must be made available prior to
  establishing a work request. Example: Part is SMR-Coded PAA, without a favorable EDD,
  fabricating activity has all capabilities to manufacture IAW technical drawings, blueprints,
  equipment technical directives or is covered under applicable general maintenance practices,
  but lacks the ability perform a listed procedure (i.e., to shot peen, perform cadmium plating,
  etc), 00-25-107 TAR is required to LM the part while deviating from technical data.
     6.4.1. Once the 00-25-107 TAR is approved, follow paragraph 6.2 to complete the
     request.
  6.5. Aircraft screws, bolts and other externally aircraft threaded hardware cannot be locally
  manufactured or repaired in any manner. Replace parts with another of identical
  specifications. Clean or repair internal threads by installing inserts IAW applicable aircraft
  technical data.
