This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 10-2, Readiness. This instruction applies to all
personnel assigned to Andersen Air Force Base (AFB), including associate units. It establishes policies
and procedures and assigns responsibilities for wing recall procedures during expanded operations in
response to increased readiness, emergencies, or disaster situations to attain and maintain 24-hour opera-
tions. Some of these actions may be in conjunction with Andersen AFB Full Spectrum Contingency Plan
(FSCP) and 36 WGI 10-207, Installation Control Center and Associated Functions.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
The wing recall procedures are streamlined and more defined in the wing recall schema as outlined in
Attachment 1. The use of a duress button was added as a last resort during COMMOUT recall procedures
for single controller operations in the 36th Wing Command Post. Unit building numbers were updated.
Changes were made to reflect the re-designation of the 36 ABW to the 36 WG. Other minor grammatical
and informational corrections have been made for ease of reading.

1. This plan has been developed to recall personnel during increased readiness, emergencies, and natural
disaster situations within our area of responsibility (AOR) on- and off- base.
   1.1. Recalls may be directed by the 36th Wing Commander (36 WG/CC) or his designated represen-
   tative in response to one or more experienced or anticipated contingencies.
   1.2. The 36th Wing Command Post (36 WG/CP) will initiate recalls for the Installation Control Cen-
   ter (ICC), the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), and wing personnel when directed by the 36 WG/
   CC. All recalls initiated by the CP will be accomplished using the pyramid alert notification system.

2. ICC Recall. When directed by the 36 WG/CC or designated alternate, the CP controller implements
ICC recall procedures. ICC members will implement unit and Contingency Support Staff (CSS) recall
procedures as required and take other actions as directed by the 36 WG/CC. Each member will appoint
2                                                                   36WGI10-202 20 DECEMBER 2007


designated alternates for 24-hour operations. They will report to the primary or alternate CP as directed
when recalled.

3. Wing Recall. When the scope of a contingency operation or emergency situation dictates the immedi-
ate recall of all personnel, the 36 WG/CC directs such action through the CP who will in turn notify
assigned organizations. The Wing Pyramid Notification Chart (Attachment 1 and Attachment 2) will be
used by the CP to initiate recalls. Units in Attachment 1 will be recalled immediately when the wing
commander directs a wing recall. After the wing commander arrives at CP, CP personnel will ask the wing
commanders which units in Attachment 2 he requires to be recalled. The two-tiered pyramid recall sys-
tem is designed to reduce recall initiation to reporting time for key members of the ICC. Units will per-
form strength reporting IAW Para 4.2.
    3.1. Wing recall and personnel accounting will commence upon designation of a locally established
    wing Recall Initiation Time represented by (RIT). The wing recall will consist of a recall of all mili-
    tary and key civilian personnel. The 36 WG/CC may conduct no-notice tests of the wing recall system
    and/or may direct a military only personnel recall. The CP will transmit additional instructions as
    determined by the 36 WG/CC at implementation time of a recall. Personnel will report to their duty
    section or as directed by their unit commander. During actual and exercise wing recalls, military per-
    sonnel will report in battle dress uniform (BDU) unless otherwise directed by the unit commander.
    Unit commander's discretion may be used in recalling shift personnel. Associate/tenant units will be
    excluded unless otherwise directed.
    3.2. Each organization will relay recall messages immediately to all sub-units. A sub-unit is any orga-
    nization or unit you are required to notify in accordance with this plan that is external to your organi-
    zation or unit. After sub-units have been notified, each organization will relay recall messages
    immediately through their internal recall procedures. After all external and internal recall responsibil-
    ities have been met, comply with the message contents.
    3.3. To facilitate a recall, each month, or as changes occur, each unit will ensure that the CP has a cur-
    rent copy of their unit recall roster by the 5th day of each month. Each unit recall roster will identify
    key civilian personnel required to respond during a base recall. Recall rosters will include a primary
    and alternate point of contact (POC) for sub-units.
    3.4. The matrix immediately following will be placed on the bottom or the back of the unit recall ros-
    ters. Unit commanders will identify key civilian personnel to be recalled on their unit recall roster.
    Recall rosters will be updated monthly and as changes occur. Sub-units will ensure organizations
    required to notify them possess the sub-unit recall roster or a duty and non-duty hour POC letter.
    3.5. Wing recall and personnel accounting will be accomplished without public announcement (news
    media) unless the directing authority advises to do so otherwise. Press releases will be accomplished
    only as directed by 36th Wing Public Affairs. Signs indicating that a wing recall is in progress will not
    be displayed at any place in public view.
    3.6. Recall Instructions. All agencies will use the following statements as applicable:
    RECALL: “THIS IS (who you are). PREPARE TO COPY RECALL INSTRUCTIONS.
    THE 36 WG/CC HAS DIRECTED A________(Recall Message, ex. Alpha 1) RECALL.

     3.7. The following recall instructions pertain to the recall of members on leave or TDY:
         3.7.1. Leave in the Local Area (On-Island): Personnel on leave in the local area will be contacted
         by the unit but will not be required physically to report for duty unless specifically directed by
         higher headquarters. Telephone or runner will accomplish recall of personnel.
         3.7.2. Leave or TDY Outside Local Area (Off-Island): When directed by higher headquarters,
         recall will be accomplished by any means available and will be followed up by a recall message
         IAW AFMAN 37-126, Preparing Official Correspondence, Attachment 2, Message Preparation
         and Processing. Guidance, including various categories of TDY personnel, will be specified by the
         recall directing authority. (Refer to the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR), Para U7220, at:
         https://secureapp2.hqda.pentagon.mil/perdiem/trvlregs.html for restrictions imposed for
         travel and transportation allowances for members recalled from leave status.)
         3.7.3. When recall of personnel on leave or TDY off-island is directed, units will prepare recall
         messages by using data on AF Form 988, Leave Request Authorization and DD Form 1610,
         Request and Authorization for TDY Travel of DOD Personnel. Attachment 3 and Attachment 4
         provide a sample format of messages. The unit monitor will provide one copy of each message to
         the 36 MSS Contingency Support Staff NLT RIT+12:00. The 36 MSS Contingency Support Staff
         will review all messages for accuracy. Under exercise situations, members will not be contacted;
         however, exercise messages will be prepared and submitted to the 36 MSS Contingency Support
         Staff.

4. Strength Reporting. The Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS) is the primary system
for strength reporting. Unit recall monitors are responsible for obtaining TBMCS system permissions and
training and entering unit strength into TBMCS upon direction. ICCS initiate all wing recalls in TBMCS.
If TBMCS is not available or if recall is not completed within 3 hours, units will submit (Attachment 4)
information to the 36 MSS Contingency Support Staff representative via e-mail or fax. In the event of
communications outage, units will submit strength reports by runner. The 36 MSS Contingency Support
Staff representatives will compile unit recall information and report to wing ICC as directed by 36 WG/
CC.
    4.1. 36 MSS Responsibilities. The 36 MSS/CC is responsible for establishing procedures to account
    for personnel during periods of increased readiness. This includes all assigned and attached military
    and DoD civilian personnel under the operational control of the PACAF unit/organization. The MPRU
    is responsible with providing units specific instructions on TBMCS strength report data entry.
       4.1.1. The Chief of Military Personnel Responsibilities will ensure that an adequate number of
       qualified and readily available primary and alternate personnel are predestinated and trained to
       man the 36 MSS Contingency Support Staff effectively upon activation.
       4.1.2. Ensure that quarterly training sessions are conducted by the 36 MSS Contingency Support
       Staff with appropriate unit recall monitors and Contingency Support Staff members for a thorough
       understanding of pyramid alert recall and accounting procedures. Training sessions will be docu-
       mented in writing and will include the specific subjects covered and the names of attendees. PRU
       will brief newly appointed unit representatives within 30 days on procedures and requirements.
       4.1.3. Upon initial notification of a recall, the 36 MSS/CC will activate the MSS Contingency
       Support Staff. The MSS Contingency Support Staff activation must occur in sufficient time for
       units to begin reporting personnel strength statistics through the MSS Contingency Support Staff.
       If TBMCS is not available, the MSS Contingency Support Staff will submit strength statistics to
       the ICC as directed until 100 percent accountability is achieved.
       4.1.4. 36 MSS/DPMPS will administer Casualty Services when required.
    4.2. Unit Responsibilities. Units will designate recall monitors and maintain an accurate appointment
    letter with 36 MSS/MPRU. Upon designation, unit recall monitors will schedule training with 36
    MSS/MPRU. Upon the initiation of a wing recall, units will perform the following:
       4.2.1. Report strength statistics until 100% accountability is achieved. Personnel strength nor-
       mally will be stabilized and shifts established by RIT+3:00. However, significant personnel
       changes occurring after R+3:00 (unit deployments, employments, recall of personnel from leave
       or TDY, losses to unit strength due to casualties, etc.) must be reported to the 36 MSS Com-
       mander’s Support Staff representatives.
       4.2.2. Use TBMCS as the primary method to report unit strength information. Groups/units (as
       appropriate) will verify authorized, assigned, TDY, leave, hospitalized, deceased, and missing per-
       sonnel information and enter appropriately into TBMCS. Use only permanently assigned person-
       nel numbers per MILPDS or PC-III. Do not include personnel deployed from another base into
       your unit. Deployed personnel are accounted via the PERSCO system. If TBMCS is inaccessible,
       the strength reporting worksheet (Attachment 4) is the secondary method of strength reporting.
       Units will report strength statistics by e-mail or fax to 36 MSS Contingency Support Staff. In the
       event of communications outage, units will submit strength reports by runner.
36WGI10-202 20 DECEMBER 2007                                                                                5


       4.2.3. The following data items will be reported:
           4.2.3.1. Assigned Strength: Total number of personnel assigned. (This total can be retrieved
           from MILPDS.) Add the number of personnel who have in-processed but have not yet been
           gained to file to the assigned strength. Each unit’s total assigned strength will be reviewed and
           validated by the 36 MSS Contingency Support Staff.
           4.2.3.2. Adjusted Strength: Assigned - (Leave On Island + Leave Off Island + TDY + Dead +
           Hosp + Missing + Other)
           4.2.3.3. To be counted as available, review the sub-paragraphs.
               4.2.3.3.1. Personnel must report for duty or be contacted and directed to go on telephone
               standby or report for a later shift. Exception: Crewmembers on crew rest for higher head-
               quarters directed missions, deployments, or redeployments will not be recalled, but con-
               sidered “available” for reporting purposes.
               4.2.3.3.2. Personnel on leave in the local area must be contacted by telephone or runner
               (real world only). Telephone standby or physically reporting for duty will not be required
               unless specifically directed by higher headquarters.

5. COMMOUT Procedures. If a contingency alert occurs during duty hours and normal telephone com-
munications fail, the wing command section will notify organizations in the order listed in paragraph 5.3.
These organizations will in turn notify sub-units in the order listed in paragraph 5.4. The wing command
section, staff judge advocate, and inspector general’s office will provide runners to assist when necessary.
If a wing recall occurs during non-duty hours and there is a COMMOUT, the following procedures apply:
   5.1. COMMOUT limited to Andersen AFB:
       5.1.1. The CP controller will notify the Security Forces controller, via LMR of COMM OUT con-
       ditions or use duress buttons if all communication mediums fail or if LMR is out, and coordinate
       initial notification actions. The CP controller will monitor the Commander's Net, if operational,
       for recall instructions as determined by the 36 WG/CC or designated alternate.
       5.1.2. The ICC representatives will provide the CP with a letter containing the following informa-
       tion: A duty hour contact point (building and room number), a non-duty hour contact point on base
       (building and room number or home address), the location of UCC (building and room number),
       the phone number of the UCC, and a POC for the letter. If a 24-hour contact point within the orga-
       nization has been established, it will be designated the non-duty hour contact point. Organizations
       will update this letter when changes occur and send the updated letters to the appropriate agencies.
           5.1.2.1. The CP will develop and maintain a consolidated unit listing for group commanders
           that includes an efficient notification route. The listing will also contain instructions that will
           be passed to key personnel. Instructions will, as a minimum, declare a COMMOUT recall; and
           announce that an ICC recall or wing recall has been directed by the 36 WG/CC.
           5.1.2.2. When directed, SFS will dispatch two patrols to the CP. The SF patrols will pick up
           the listing and pass recall instructions on a door-to-door basis.
           5.1.2.3. The two SF patrols will notify key representatives or their designated alternates about
           the recall.
6                                                                 36WGI10-202 20 DECEMBER 2007


          5.1.2.4. When directed by the 36 WG/CC or designated alternate, CP personnel will use pub-
          lic address systems to alert the Andersen AFB population of a base recall.
          5.1.2.5. When directed by the 36 WG/CC, PA will program a recall message on the Com-
          mander’s Access Channel (CAC).
          5.1.2.6. The person residing off base who is initially contacted will initiate telephone contact
          with the next available individual down his/her recall list who resides off base. Instructions to
          contact others residing off base will be passed with subsequent calls. If personnel residing off
          base are listed on the recall roster above the initially contacted individual, attempts to contact
          these personnel will be made while access to an off-base telephone is available. Do not delay
          reporting for a recall more than 30 minutes to further attempt upward contacts.
          5.1.2.7. Each person residing off the installation will provide their orderly room, unit control
          center (UCC), and supervisor with a detailed map of the area in which they reside, using well
          known landmarks as a guide. The mapped area will include the members Rank/Name, House
          Number, and Telephone Number (if applicable). Each map will include instructions, with ini-
          tial starting point at the Andersen’s main gate to the individual’s quarters.
    5.2. Alerting System to UCCs or shelters during COMMOUT:
       5.2.1. When directed by the 36 WG/CC, UCC and ICC communication will be by runner.
       5.2.2. Organizations with access to LMRs will ensure LMRs and two batteries are available for
       use by their UCCs.
    5.3. Primary Phase Notification for a COMMOUT during duty hours:
       5.3.1. First wing command section runner will carry the notification message to the organizations
       in the order listed:
          •   Wing Command Section
