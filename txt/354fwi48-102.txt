This instruction implements AFPD 48-1, Aerospace Medicine Program. It describes procedures to
protect personnel from the adverse health effects of heat/cold stress. This instruction applies to all
personnel assigned, attached or associated with Eielson AFB, Alaska. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123
(will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air
Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication updates minor changes in nomenclature, e.g. SRC to EOC (Emergency Operations
Center). It also updates the most current heat stress training guidelines detailed in Table 2 and Table
2.1.
1. Concept and History. Among U.S. Army and Army Air Force troops, there were over 90,000 cold
injuries requiring medical treatment during World War II and another 10,000 during the Korean War,
accounting for 10% of all casualties experienced during these conflicts. Given the average air
temperature recorded when cold injuries were experienced during World War II was 30o Fahrenheit (F),
and temperatures this low are experienced over about 60% of the earth's surface, leaders must appreciate
cold-weather effects on airmen’s health and performance. Prevention of cold injuries is the
responsibility of supervisors at all levels. This instruction provides commanders and supervisors with
guidance for operations in hot and cold environments. This instruction applies to both peacetime and
contingency/exercise operations.

     their workers about the signs, symptoms, prevention, and self-aid/buddy care for heat and cold
     stress.
     4.3. The Weather Station (354 OSS/OSW) will:
        4.3.1. Configure the Automated Observation System (AOS) to calculate equivalent chill
        temperature (ECT) and indicate the appropriate cold stress condition, as defined in this
        instruction.
        4.3.2. Notify Command Post, Air Traffic Control Tower, and Base Ops as criteria is forecast or
        observed to meet established criteria (established criteria is weather warning, watches, and
        advisories).
        4.3.3. Relay wind speed, temperature and dew point readings to the BEE element via the
        telephone, when requested, and report this information to the wing operations center during
        exercises/contingencies.
     4.4. Command Post (FW/CP)
        4.4.1. The Command Post will observe the AOS from the New Tactical Forecast System
        (NTFS) display to determine the current cold stress condition. Command Post will comply with
        notifications listed in FWI 10-203 (Base Adverse Weather Procedures). These notifications only
354FWI48-102 7 April 2009                                                                            3


      need to occur whenever equivalent wind chill temperatures are below 40 degrees Fahrenheit or
      when the cold stress conditions change.
      4.4.2. Command Post will receive the current heat stress condition from BEE via telephone
      during the summer. During routine operations, the Command Post will advise the following two
      agencies of the current heat/cold stress condition and appropriate precautions.

Table 1. Agencies of Current Heat/Cold Stress Condition and Appropriate Precautions.




      4.4.3. During exercise or contingency operations, 354 FW/CC will decide work/cooling and
      work/warming cycles and MOPP options on a case by case basis using the recommendations
      provided by BEE. During contingency/exercise operations, the EOC will communicate the
      appropriate heat/cold stress conditions and precautions to the unit control centers.
   4.5. Supervisors will:
      4.5.1. Provide cool drinking water convenient to the work area when the heat stress condition is
      caution or above (see attachment 3). Provide warm, sweet liquids or soup when cold stress
      conditions are caution or above (see attachment 3). Consumption of caffeine during these cold
      stress conditions should be discouraged.
      4.5.2. Monitor workers for signs of heat/cold stress and intervene when appropriate, or
      implement and enforce a "buddy system” whenever heat/cold stress conditions are moderate or
      above.
      4.5.3. Train workers on heat/cold stress symptoms and prevention and document training on the
      AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record. Supervisors may use Attachment 1, and
      the information available on the BEE website as training materials.
      4.5.4. Implement work/cooling and work/warming cycles in accordance with paragraphs 5 and 6
      and 354 FWVA 48-1 (attachment 3).
      4.5.5. Ensure proper facilities are available for cooling/warming cycles (indoors or shade during
      hot environments and a warm place during cold environments). Take proper precautions to
      ensure personnel are not overexposed to diesel exhaust from the H1 heaters when heating
      warming shelters (hardened shelters, vans, and bubbles). H1 heaters must be placed downwind
      from the shelter, the heater intake facing into wind, and a minimum of two heating ducts (in
      series) used. Personnel should exit the shelter any time they feel light-headed, dizzy, and/or
      nauseous. If symptoms persist or warrant medical attention, dial 911 immediately for prompt
      medical care. Users should not adjust the H1 heaters’ thermostats. Contact 354 MXS AGE to
      exchange the H1 heaters if they are not providing adequate heat.

        4.5.6. Post copies of 354 FWVA 48-1 on the workplace safety board.
     4.6. All Iceman Team members will:
        4.6.1. Adhere to work/cooling and work/warming cycles.
        4.6.2. Increase electrolyte intake during hot weather by either increasing salt intake or by
        periodically drinking sports drinks, such as Gatorade, Powerade, or Exceed.
        4.6.3. Stay hydrated. Drink small amounts of water frequently (1 cup every 15 minutes) during
        warm weather. Consume liquids frequently during cold weather and increase sodium intake
        during hot conditions. Keep consumption of alcohol and caffeine moderate since these have a
        dehydrating effect and reduce tolerance to heat and cold stress.
        4.6.4. Maintain good physical condition. A balanced diet, adequate rest, and routine aerobic
        exercise greatly increase an individual’s tolerance to heat and cold stress.
        4.6.5. Receive training from their supervisors on heat/cold stress symptoms and prevention
        using Attachment 1.
     4.7. Commanders will:
        4.7.1. Enforce these precautions for their subordinates
        4.7.2. Purchase protective equipment, such as warming/cooling vests (when prescribed by BEE)
        and cold weather gear for routinely exposed workers.
        4.7.3. Avoid scheduling outdoor formations when conditions are Caution/Cat 3 or above.
     4.8. 354 FW Civilian Employees will follow the temperature restrictions outlined in the current
     Labor Management Agreement, Article 15.
     4.9. Air National Guard Civilian Employees will follow the temperature restrictions outlined in the
     current Labor Management Agreement, Article 26.
5. Heat Stress Conditions . Support/Ground Personnel. Heat stress is rarely encountered at Eielson
AFB due to its location. There may be occasions where individuals could be affected by heat stress.
BEE will announce the heat stress condition for the following exposure groups: hazardous materials
response/fire-fighting and MOPP (during exercises and contingencies). BEE will notify the EOC of the
conditions during exercises. BEE will notify the Fire Department of the hazardous materials
response/fire-fighting heat stress index directly. Attachment 1 contains definitions of these conditions.
Supervisors and workers will follow the appropriate work/cooling cycle for their announced condition.
These are in the following tables:

7. Chemical-Biological Warfare Defense (CBWD) Cold Weather Operations.
   7.1. Commanders should not consider cold conditions a deterrent to chemical warfare (CW) agent
   use. Agent physical properties are affected by temperature, but the effectiveness is not always
   degraded at very low temperatures. The major threat from the employment of chemical warfare
   weapons in cold regions is the delayed action. The danger is created when nerve and blister agents
   are carried into heated shelters on clothing, footgear, or other equipment. The warmth of the shelter
   will reactivate these agents creating a chemical vapor and/or a liquid hazard in the enclosed area.
   7.2. During SERE operations, the 354 FW will adhere to the following cold weather procedures:
      7.2.1. Cold weather clothing (parka, BDU jacket, B1 mittens, etc) is to be worn OVER the
      ground crew ensemble (GCE) if the individual needs protection from the cold. This is an
      appropriate practice during exercises and real world operations. Items worn over the GCE will
      become contaminated upon contact with chemical/biological warfare (CW/BW) agents and must
      be properly discarded during decontamination procedures.
      7.2.2. Do not wear cotton inserts below 32° F. For temperatures between 32° F and -10° F,
      personnel should wear polypropylene gloves and wool inserts under the rubber gloves.
      Personnel may also wear winter or leather gloves over the rubber gloves. When temperatures
      fall below -10° F, personnel should wear polypropylene gloves, wool inserts, and winter gloves
      (minus the rubber gloves).
      7.2.3. For safety reasons, personnel should use extreme caution when wearing the black lace-up
      chemical protective boots when snow and ice are present on paved surfaces. When these
      conditions exist, specific concerns should be channeled up to the Emergency Operations Center
      (EOC). The EOC will issue a Battle Staff Directive (BSD) detailing specific actions required by
      personnel. Personnel should wear military-issue winter boots, such as Mukluks or Sorels™ if a
      BSD is issued prohibiting the wear of the black lace-up chemical boots. Vapor barrier boots (i.e.
      “bunny boots”) are always an approved alternative to chemical warfare over boots.
      7.2.4. In extremely cold temperatures, the MCU-2AP mask becomes very rigid and is difficult to
      don. When donned at these temperatures, the protective mask causes instantaneous frostbite on
      the individual’s face. Due to this potential, 354 FW personnel will not wear the MCU-2AP gas-
      mask outdoors, during exercises, when Equivalent Chill Temperatures (ECT) reach 0° F. If
      moving from indoors to outdoors, remove mask and dry face prior to going outside. Personnel
      will wear the mask when indoors.
      7.2.5. When temperatures are above 0° F personnel will observe the appropriate MOPP level,
      including wear of the gas-mask. Below freezing, personnel should be aware the mask may still
      be very cold and be somewhat rigid. Also, the mask eye lenses may fog and freeze when the
      mask is donned. In addition, breath condensation may freeze the valves and the voice emitter
      assembly. To minimize this, the mask must be carried under outer garments to remain relatively
      warm from the individual’s body heat. Please refer to AFMAN 32-4005, paragraph A7.3.1.1, for
      specific instructions for cold-weather use of the mask. These instructions are essential for the
      proper functioning of this piece of equipment.
