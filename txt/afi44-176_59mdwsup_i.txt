                                           Chapter 3

                            APPOINTING AND SCHEDULING

3.1. Overview of Appointing.
   3.1.1. The MTF access manager and/or clinical personnel in conjunction with appropriate
   functional POC(s) will ensure appointing information systems to include Composite Health
   Care System (CHCS) and TRICARE Online (TOL) and their related business processes
   support all applicable ATC policies of the MHS and the AFMS. These policies and AFIs
   include those governing the Patient Centered Medical Home Model, the Family Health
   Initiative and Primary Care Manager By Name (PCMBN) processes. Appointing processes
   will be established to successfully answer the patient’s needs. This would include
   maximizing continuity, whereby patients are appointed first to their assigned PCM and then
   next within the primary care group/team. If this is not achievable, MTFs will optimize MTF
   direct care resources so that appropriate care is coordinated with the least number of handoffs
   possible during the first telephone call or request for care. If direct care resources are not
   available, appropriate MTF personnel will work with the MCSCs/network resources to
   secure the appropriate level of care.
      3.1.1.1. (Added-59MDW) Appointment Availability. Retaining eligible population in
      the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) enables the Air Force Medical Service to provide
      efficient, cost-effective, customer-centric health care while optimizing MTF clinical
      specialty capabilities and expeditionary medical skills. Every effort will be made to
      retain the maximum level of consults/referrals ordered in the direct care system and
      minimize leakage to the network for all patients. Therefore, clinical appointment
      availability must match or exceed historical demand to ensure patients are seen within the
      Access to Care (ATC) standards. Department chairmen, service chiefs, Group Practice
      Managers (GPMs)/access and template managers, and the MTF Access Manager are all
      responsible for ensuring these standards are met.
   3.1.2. Personnel who develop templates and schedules will use the MHS standard
   appointment types and ATC standards. The standard appointment type operational
   definitions and applicable guidance are listed below beginning with paragraph 3.2.
   3.1.3. Appointing personnel will select one of the five ATC categories in the Composite
   Health Care System (CHCS) appointing search function. The appropriate ATC standard is
   based on the timeline the patient requests for care or on locally based protocols to guide
   appropriate timeliness of appointments booked. The ATC categories with time standards are:
      3.1.3.1. Acute ATC Category has a 24 hour/1,440 minute ATC standard.
      3.1.3.2. Routine ATC Category has a 7 calendar day/10,080 minute ATC standard.
      3.1.3.3. Specialty ATC Category has a 28 calendar day/40,320 minute ATC standard.
      3.1.3.4. Wellness ATC Category has a 28 calendar day/40,320 minute ATC standard.
      3.1.3.5. Future CHCS search function does not have an ATC time standard.
   3.1.4. MTFs will develop and implement written processes and training programs to ensure
   appointing personnel comply with all applicable MHS and AFMS ATC guidance and
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                             13


   procedures. MTFs in multi-service markets or with shared appointing service personnel will
   ensure that required training is IAW MHS and AFMS ATC guidance.
3.2. Use of Standard Appointment Types. The following documents should be readily
available to all stakeholders as the MTF implements this AFI: “The MHS Guide for Access
Success and the “The MTF Referral Management Center User’s Guide.” These references will
be considered recommended reading for members of the access management team and should be
included in their orientation to their access manager role. All access standards are defined in
calendar days and/or minutes. MTFs will choose from the following ten MHS Standard
Appointment types and applicable guidance:
   3.2.1. PCM (Initial Primary Care Appointment):
       3.2.1.1. Definition: The PCM appointment type is designed for the initial primary care
       visit with the PCM to collect health data, family history, readiness data, etc. A PCM visit
       may or may not be the patient’s first visit to the PCM since an acute or routine
       appointment may precede a PCM visit. Sites can use this appointment type to track
       whether the PCM has completed this initial visit as defined by the TRICARE benefit.
       This appointment type is not designed to meet acute or routine health care needs.
       3.2.1.2. Where used: Only in primary care clinics.
       3.2.1.3. ATC Category and Standard: For all appointing information system booking
       methods except Referral Booking, appointing agents will use the Wellness ATC Category
       or information system search function to book PCM appointments. To meet the Wellness
       ATC Standard, the patient’s PCM appointment type must be within 28 days or 40,320
       minutes from the patient’s request.
   3.2.2. ROUT (Routine Appointment):
       3.2.2.1. Definition: The ROUT appointment type is designated for patients who require
       an office visit with their PCM or mental health provider for a new health care problem
       that is not considered urgent.
Note: Routine Mental Health Care is defined as an initial request for a new mental health
condition or exacerbation of a previously diagnosed condition for which intervention is required
but is not urgent.
           3.2.2.1.1. MTF primary care and mental health clinics operating under traditional
           appointing (i.e. non-Open Access (OA)) will use this appointment type on their
           schedules.
       3.2.2.2. In the case of health care that is not characterized as mental health, appropriate
       clinical personnel can offer other appropriate alternatives for care such as self-care.
       Appointing staff need to be aware that these routine mental health care requests should be
       appointed within 7 days and can be appointed to the patient’s PCM, Behavioral Health
       Optimization Clinic (BHOP) or Mental Health Clinic providers.
       3.2.2.3. Where used: Only in primary care and mental health clinics.
       3.2.2.4. ATC Category and Standard: For all appointing information system booking
       methods except Referral Booking, appointing agents will use the Routine ATC Category
       or system search function to book ROUT appointments. To meet the Routine ATC
14                                                    AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


        Standard, the appointment must be within 7 days or 10,080 minutes from the patient’s
        request.
     3.2.3. SPEC (Initial Specialty Care Appointment).
        3.2.3.1. Definition: The SPEC appointment type is designed for the initial consult or
        referral appointment to a specialist or an initial self referral for specialty care by a patient
        to a specialist. Generally speaking, the appointing information system will assign the
        ATC Standard and Category that matches the referral priority entered by the requesting
        provider, but not to exceed 28 days. A SPEC appointment may be booked for a consult
        or referral with any priority.
            3.2.3.1.1. To the greatest extent possible, MTFs will establish processes to book the
            specialty appointment in the MTF prior to the patient leaving the MTF. The
            Appointment Order Processing (AOP) option should always be used to book
            appointments for consults and referrals in order to link the appointment to the consult
            that authorizes the care. If the specialty care needs to be provided by the network,
            local processes for providing specialty care will be followed.
        3.2.3.2. Where used: Only for specialty clinics and primary care clinics with specialty
        care, e.g. Family Practice Clinics that also provide Gynecology and Obstetrical Care.
        3.2.3.3. ATC Category and Standard:
            3.2.3.3.1. In Referral Booking: CHCS will automatically assign the correct ATC
            Category to the priority designated by the requesting provider, e.g. ASAP, Today,
            STAT, 48 Hrs, 72 Hrs, and Routine priorities. To meet the Specialty ATC Standard,
            the appointment must be within 28 days or 40,320 minutes from the patient’s request.
            The appointment type booked is not required to match the ATC Standard for consults
            and referrals. Any appointment type may be booked. If the Routine referral priority
            request is for a stated time period such as, “Patient to be seen in 14 days” the
            appointment is required to be booked in that time frame.
            3.2.3.3.2. Self Referral Booking. In a Specialty Clinic that allows self referrals,
            “regular” booking functions are used by appointing personnel. In this instance
            appointing personnel will use the Specialty ATC Category/information system search
            function to book the SPEC appointment. To meet the Specialty ATC Standard, the
            appointment must be within 28 days or 40,320 minutes from the patient’s request.
  3.2.4. ACUT (Acute Appointment).
        3.2.4.1. Definition: The ACUT appointment type is designed for scheduling
        appointments for beneficiaries who have a need for non-emergent, urgent care that
        requires treatment within 24 hours.
        3.2.4.2. Where used: For both primary and specialty care clinics.
        3.2.4.3. ATC Category and Standard: For all information system booking methods
        including Referral Booking and AOP, appointing agents will use the Acute ATC
        Category or information system search function to book ACUT appointments. To meet
        the Acute ATC Standard, the appointment must be within 24 hours (1,440 minutes) from
        the patient’s request.
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                             15


  3.2.5. WELL (Wellness or Health Promotion Appointment).
     3.2.5.1. Definition: The WELL appointment type is designated for patients who require
     preventive, health maintenance care (e.g., physical examinations, periodic examinations,
     check-ups, screenings, etc.).
     3.2.5.2. Where used: both primary and specialty care clinics.
     3.2.5.3. ATC Category and Standard: In all information system booking methods except
     Referral Booking, appointing agents will use the Wellness ATC Category or information
     system search functions to book WELL appointments. The WELL appointment type will
     map to the 28-day Wellness ATC standard. To meet the Wellness ATC Standard, the
     appointment must be within 28 days or 40,320 minutes from the patient’s request.
  3.2.6. EST (Established Patient Follow-up with Designated Time Allotment).
     3.2.6.1. Definition: The EST appointment will be used when a patient is scheduled for
     follow-up care per direction of a PCM, Primary Care Team member, or a Specialist. The
     EST appointment type is designated for patients who request a follow-up appointment
     with the PCM. The EST is also designed for a patient who requests a follow-up
     appointment with a specialist for other than initial specialty care, acute health care, or to
     have a procedure performed. An established appointment should be scheduled with a
     provider per the initial provider’s time designation.
         3.2.6.1.1. The EST appointment type and Future Search will not be a substitute
         booking practice for patients requiring anything other than the described EST
         appointment needs.
         3.2.6.1.2. For patients requiring follow-up care, MTFs will offer, to the greatest
         extent possible, to book EST appointments per provider request prior to the patient
         leaving the clinic from their initial Primary or Specialty Care appointment.
     3.2.6.2. Where used: For both primary and specialty care clinics.
     3.2.6.3. ATC Category and Standard: There is no ATC Standard. In all information
     system booking methods, appointment agents will use the Future Search to book EST
     appointments. In Referral Booking, EST appointments can be booked for other than the
     initial appointment by changing the ATC Category on the referral to Future.
  3.2.7. PROC (Procedure Appointment)
     3.2.7.1. Definition: The PROC appointment type is designated for patients in need of
     medical procedures other than those performed in the Ambulatory Procedure Unit (APU
     – B**5 MEPRS Clinics). Procedures performed in APUs will be considered Ambulatory
     Procedure Visits (APVs) and will be scheduled using the ambulatory same day procedure
     appointing subsystem. A procedure appointment request without a referral will be
     scheduled with a provider within 28 days or per the referring provider’s designation. The
     provider’s designation must not exceed 28 days. If the provider refers the patient for a
     procedure in the clinic setting, CHCS will assign the PROC appointment the ATC
     Standard and Category that matches the referral priority entered by the requesting
     provider. In this case, the appointment type that is booked is not required to match the
     ATC Category or Standard.
16                                                  AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


           3.2.7.1.1. MTFs will establish processes to book or arrange PROC appointments
           prior to the patient leaving the MTF to the greatest extent possible. If the procedure
           needs to be provided by the network or other MTFs, local processes will be followed.
        3.2.7.2. Where used: For both primary and specialty care clinics.
        3.2.7.3. ATC Category and Standard:
           3.2.7.3.1. In Referral Booking: The CHCS appointing information system will
           automatically assign the correct ATC Category to the priority designated by the
           requesting provider, e.g. ASAP, Today, STAT, 48 Hrs, 72 Hrs, and Routine priorities.
           To meet the Specialty ATC Standard of a Routine priority referral, the PROC
           appointment must be within 28 days or 40,320 minutes from the date the referral is
           entered. The appointment type booked is not required to match the Specialty ATC
           category. Any appointment type may be booked. If the Routine referral priority
           request is for a stated time period such as, “Patient to have procedure in 14 days” the
           appointment is required to be booked in that time frame.
           3.2.7.3.2. Self Referral Booking. In a clinic that allows it to be a self-referral clinic,
           “regular” booking functions can be used by appointing personnel. In this instance
           appointing personnel will use the Specialty ATC Category/information system search
           function to book the PROC appointment. To meet the Specialty ATC Standard, the
           PROC appointment must be within 28 days or 40,320 minutes from the patient’s
           request.
  3.2.8. GRP (Group Appointments with Multiple Patients).
        3.2.8.1. Definition: The GRP (Group) appointment type will be used for patients who
        require therapy, counseling, or teaching sessions where a provider will perform the
        service in a group setting. The detail code fields can be used to provide further
        information about the care to be provided in the group appointment, (e.g., TOBCES, a
        Tobacco Cessation Class). A group appointment should be scheduled per self referral of
        the patient, or the clinic’s or referring provider’s guidance or designation.
           3.2.8.1.1. The GRP appointment type will NOT be used to book multiple patients
           into a single time slot for wellness (WELL), routine, (ROUT), acute (ACUT),
           established (EST), specialty (SPEC) care, procedures (PROC) or for open access
           (OPAC) appointments. These specific appointment types should allow multiple
           patients being booked into one slot for these types of health care services.
        3.2.8.2. Where used: For both primary and specialty care clinics.
        3.2.8.3. ATC Category and Standard: There is no ATC Standard for the GRP
        appointment type. For all appointing information system booking functions or methods
        except Referral Booking, appointment agents will use only the Future ATC Category
        search to book GRP appointments. In Referral Booking the GRP appointment type may
        be booked for any ATC category appropriate for specialty care, e.g. Acute, Specialty, and
        Future.
        3.2.8.4. A group appointment should be scheduled per the referring provider’s
        recommended time that the patient needs the care.
     3.2.9. OPAC (Open Access (OA)).
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                            17


      3.2.9.1. Definition: The OPAC appointment type may be used by all MTF clinics. The
      OPAC appointment type may be used by those Family Health Teams, other primary care
      and specialty care clinics to offer patients acute, routine, wellness, specialty, procedure
      or follow-up services within 24 hours (1,440 minutes) of their initial request. Use of the
      OPAC appointment type should not open the clinic into a full “walk-in” type service. To
      the greatest extent possible, all patient issues are addressed in a single OPAC visit to
      minimize the need for unnecessary future appointments or repeat visits.
      3.2.9.2. ATC Category and Standard: For all information system booking methods
      including Referral Booking and AOP, appointing agents will use the Acute ATC
      Category or information system search function to book OPAC appointments. To meet
      the Acute ATC Standard, the appointment must be within 24 hours (1,440 minutes) from
      the patient’s request.
   3.2.10. Other Embedded Appointment Types:
      3.2.10.1. Five fixed appointment types, used for processing by CHCS, will continue to
      be supported as follows.
         3.2.10.1.1. APV (Ambulatory Procedure Visit). This appointment type is used for
         outpatient same day surgery visits. Same Day Surgery clinics may have a location
         type of C (Clinic) or S (Same Day Surgery). If the clinic location type is S, then all
         ambulatory visits (APV appointments) for the clinic will be picked up in the VAP
         (Ambulatory Visits) option in order to record minutes of service. There is no access
         standard for this appointment type and therefore, the ATC is Future.
         3.2.10.1.2. EROOM (Emergency Department/Room Visit). The Emergency Room
         may use EROOM or any standard appointment type.
         3.2.10.1.3. N-MTF (Non-MTF Appointment). This is used to document a downtown
         appointment logged into CHCS. This appointment type must be added to the Non-
         MTF Place of Care’s (Clinic) profile and to the individual provider appointment type
         profiles for each provider linked to that non-MTF place of care. When a Health Care
         Finder (HCF) logs a non-MTF appointment, the system will automatically populate
         the appointment type field with the N-MTF appointment type.
         3.2.10.1.4. T-CON* (Telephone consultation that needs to be answered). This non-
         searchable appointment type will be added to an individual provider’s Provider
         Profile and the provider will be a User in the User file before telephone consults may
         be entered for the specified provider.
         3.2.10.1.5. RNDS (Rounds). Used by CHCS to help providers account for inpatient
         rounding. This appointment type cannot be placed in outpatient appointment
         schedules and is automatically generated each night for each current inpatient.
3.3. ATC Categories and search options: appointment types with corresponding ATC
Standards. Appointing personnel will use Table 1 as a quick reference in booking
appointments:

Table 3.1. ATC Categories and Search Options.
      ATC Category/        Standard Appointment           ATC Standard (Time In Which

                           APV
3.4. Use of Dollar Sign ($) Suffix on Appointment Types.
   3.4.1. MTFs may use appointment types with the $ as the last character on all standard
   appointment types to indicate these slots are to be booked by MTF/clinic staff only, e.g.
   PCM$, ROUT$. This use of the $ is only applicable when the MTF has a centralized
   appointing cell and/or arrangements or “gentlemen’s” agreements have been made with local
   government appointing offices/contractors in a multi-market service area with a regional,
   centralized appointing function. Standard appointment types with the $ will not be booked
   unless they have MTF/clinic approval.
   3.4.2. MTFs located in such areas with these arrangements will try to limit the use of $ on
   appointment slots because it increases the probability that the agents working in the MTF’s
   central or multi-market/regional appointing office/function will book these appointments for
   the MTFs they support. Limited use of $ appointments allows the personnel working in these
   central offices to do the work that they were funded to perform. Therefore, use of $ sign will
   be limited to no more than 10% of all appointments for each clinic. It diverts appointing
   workload from MTF personnel that were not specifically funded to book appointments.
   MTFs will use appointing protocols as much as possible to guide central office appointing
   personnel to book as many MTFs appointments as are feasible.
   3.4.3. Individual MTF clinics will not use the $ suffix to prevent other MTF appointing
   personnel (including government or contractor MTF centralized appointing
   functions/desks/offices) from booking these appointments or to make it a provider book only
   slot. The Provider Book Only (PBO) detail code may be used to accomplish this function.
   3.4.4. To maximize the number of web-enabled (WEA) appointments, MTFs will not use the
   $ in conjunction with the WEA code as this prevents these appointments from being booked
   via the TRICARE Online (TOL) appointing capability.
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                              19


3.5. Maintaining Continuity/PCM Booking.
   3.5.1. Definition: Continuity is the percentage of visits patients make to their own
   PCM/PCM team when receiving primary care. Its benefits are numerous:
      3.5.1.1. It is consistent with high quality, cost effective patient care.
      3.5.1.2. Helps PCMs/teams gain their patients’ confidence, increasing their satisfaction
      and enables them to be more effective patient advocates.
      3.5.1.3. Facilitates efficient/effective coordination of the patient's health services by
      allowing PCMs/teams to make early recognition of problems possible.
      3.5.1.4. Supports the long-term patient-physician partnership in which the physician
      knows the patient’s history from experience and can integrate new information and
      decisions from a whole-patient perspective efficiently without extensive investigation or
      record review.
      3.5.1.5. Reduces the need for additional or return visits, tests or procedures.
   3.5.2. MTFs will develop appointing protocols that will maximize continuity whereby
   enrollees are appointed to their assigned primary care manager, team or group to the
   maximum extent possible. The goal of continuity is that the PCM/PCM team and/or the
   individual Family Health Team (FHT) provider, and the FHT are appointed with their
   empanelled population to the maximum extent possible.
3.6. Team/Element/Group Booking.
   3.6.1. Definition: Team/Element/Group booking is the appointing and/or visit made by the
   enrollee of one provider of a team/element/group to another provider of the same
   team/element/group. The providers assigned to the Team/Element/Group cover for each
   other. Example: Mrs. Doe who is the enrollee of Dr. Smith of the Blue Family Health Team
   at the 123rd MDG gets appointed to Dr. Jones of the Blue Family Team at the 123rd MDG.
   3.6.2. MTFs will develop booking practices to maximize booking of enrollees first to their
   assigned PCM and then to their assigned team. The PCM booking module in CHCS fully
   supports this function. The inputting of referrals is not required. This activity fully supports
   the principle of continuity.
3.7. Cross Booking.
   3.7.1. Definition: Cross booking is the appointing of an enrollee assigned to one provider on
   a team/element/group to another provider assigned to another team/element/group that the
   patient is not empanelled to, provided MTF business rules support cross capacity permits.
   Example: Mrs. Jane Doe who is the enrollee of Dr. Smith of the Blue Family Health Team at
   the 123rd MDG gets appointed to Dr. Jones of the Red Family Team at the 123rd MDG. It
   this event, a primary or specialty care referral may be required. This event should not be
   confused with “Team/Element/Group Booking.”
   3.7.2. MTFs will have to balance PCM/PCM Team continuity with keeping enrollee care
   within the MTF and meeting ATC standards. Cross booking supports the latter, and will be
   primarily used by MTFs that do not have network access, OCONUS, for example.
3.8. Patients Who Refuse Appointments Offered Within ATC Standards.
 20                                               AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


   3.8.1. A patient may waive ATC standards and request appointments outside of ATC
   Standards for convenience reasons or to maintain continuity with their provider, even though
   the MTF may have appointments available inside ATC Standards.
   3.8.2. Appointing personnel will document patient refusals IAW information system
   processes to ensure these booking transactions result in a patient refusal as opposed to not
   meeting access to care standards.
3.9. Booking Transactions Not Meeting Access Standards.
   3.9.1. MTFs will use the ATC categories and information system searches that best represent
   the patient's needs, even if they do not find available appointments within the ATC standard.
   Issues may include and not be limited to making a tradeoff between meeting access standards
   or maintain continuity. Appointing agents should be trained to do what is best for patient
   care.
   3.9.2. Initial ATC searches may not meet access standards. Not meeting standards is an
   indication of many factors to include increased demand, maintaining continuity, lack of
   capacity, wrong provider mix, wrong appointment type mix, increased operations tempo,
   under resourcing, or incorrectly determining the needs of the patient. One of the goals of the
   booking process is to accurately record the results of meeting ATC Standards.
3.10. Requests for Appointments Not Resulting in a Booked Appointment and Unbooked
Appointment Reasons.
   3.10.1. Appointing personnel will be trained to accurately use the Unbooked Appointment
   Request/Reporting functionality of CHCS. This functionality allows for the tracking and
   reporting of patients who requested an appointment, a search was performed, but the
   appointment request did not result in an appointment being booked.
   3.10.2. Appointing personnel will choose the most accurate Unbooked Appointment Request
   reason matching why the search attempt did not result in a booked appointment. Appointing
   personnel will become familiar with the operational definitions of Unbooked Appointment
   Request reasons and this functionality’s reports per definitions listed below:
      3.10.2.1. Added to Waitlist: Patient was added to the MTF waitlist and patient
      preferences for the direct care appointment were documented.
      3.10.2.2. All Appointments Refused: The patient refused all offered MTF/direct care
      appointments inside and/or outside the ATC standard.
      3.10.2.3. Appointed to Network: Patient was instructed that care was not available in the
      MTF/direct care system and was directed to the network.
      3.10.2.4. No Appointments Available: No appropriate appointments were available in
      the MTF/direct care system for the clerk to book. Follow-up with the patient is required.
      3.10.2.5. No Appointments Available to Contractor: No appropriate appointments were
      available in the MTF/direct care system for the appointing contractor to book. Follow-
      up with the patient and/or the clinic is required.
      3.10.2.6. Patient Requested To Call Back: The patient requested to call back later to get
      an MTF appointment. Clerk should document in the free text field the reason why.
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                               21


      3.10.2.7. Request Referred to MCSC:          The patient was referred to the MCSC (or
      contractor) for issue resolution.
      3.10.2.8. Request Referred to MTF Clinic: The patient was referred (usually by the
      contractor or appointing contractor) to the MTF clinic for issue resolution.
      3.10.2.9. Self-Care Recommended: Clerk referred the patient to a clinician to answer the
      patient’s questions and to provide a self-care plan if appropriate.
      3.10.2.10. Unsuccessful Telephone Transfer: Clerk attempted to transfer the patient but
      the telephone system dropped the call.
      3.10.2.11. Just Looking: The clerk was entering test data into the system, checking
      availability of appointments, or performing other administrative tasks not related to
      booking an actual patient request. This reason will not be used for actual patient requests
      for clinical care.
          3.10.2.11.1. Appointing personnel will not use the “Just Looking” unbooked
          appointment reason for all searches that did not result in a booked appointment. A
          high rate of these reasons minimizes the usability and benefits of this report. If
          overused, a site may want to consider these as No Appointment Available.
      3.10.2.12. Other (Free Text): This reason may be used for patient requests whose
      disposition is not covered by any of the above reasons. Use the free text field to
      document the actual disposition of the patient request. Sites should develop standards for
      data entry into this reason field.
   3.10.3. Appointing staff may use the Unbooked Appointment Request Report to manage
   patient call-backs. This report provides all the necessary information to facilitate this process
   to include the patient’s name, phone number, need for care, requested clinic, etc.
   3.10.4. Appointing staff will not delete unbooked (unused) appointment slots from the
   appointing system or remaining schedules. MTFs will have processes in place to perform
   ongoing reviews of the numbers and rates of unbooked (unused) appointments compared to
   available/booked appointments.
      3.10.4.1. Reviews of unbooked or unused appointments help ensure that scheduling
      practices are efficient and provider and support staff scheduled time in clinic is
      maximized.
      3.10.4.2. High or low numbers and/or rates of unbooked or unused appointments may
      indicate access to care issues or program success, but only when other indicators of
      access are reviewed such as continuity levels, ATC Met scores, level of demand or
      supply, patient satisfaction/Service Delivery Assessment rates, and the numbers of urgent
      and/or routine referrals sent to the network, numbers of walk-in appointments, etc.
3.11. No-Shows.
   3.11.1. Definition. An appointment is designated a No-Show when a patient does not keep a
   scheduled appointment or cancels less than two hours prior to a scheduled appointment.
   Appointments before 0900 need to be cancelled prior to the close of business the previous
   duty day. A patient who fails to provide notification as specified above is considered a No-
 22                                               AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


   Show. It is dependent on authorized MTF staff to accurately identify and manually update
   this No-Show status in CHCS.
      3.11.1.1. (Added-59MDW) 59 MDW No Show Policy.
          3.11.1.1.1. (Added-59MDW) No Shows will be handled in the following manner:
              3.11.1.1.1.1. (Added-59MDW) On the first No Show, primary care or specialty
              care, patients will be contacted within 48 hours of their missed appointment to
              reschedule or determine if treatment is necessary. A note of attempts to contact
              the patient will be documented in the beneficiary’s record in CHCS.
              3.11.1.1.1.2. (Added-59MDW) On the second No Show, all future specialty
              care appointments within that clinic will be cancelled and require a new referral
              from the Primary Care Manager (PCM). Attempts to contact the patient of this
              action will be documented. The current referral will be administratively closed
              and the PCM notified. No Show notifications will be sent to squadron
              commanders for Active Duty members who miss appointments twice or more
              within a clinic.
   3.11.2. MTFs will strive to minimize their No-Show rates. The goal is to have No-Show
   rates of less than five percent (5%) of all booked appointments. To achieve this standard,
   MTFs will educate its patient population on medical no show appointment procedures and
   may incorporate measures such as briefing wing leadership on the cost of no shows by
   squadron, and publishing articles in the base newspaper or electronic news-bulletin. The
   MTF should consider sending letters to patients that were No-Shows for appointments.
   3.11.3. MTFs leadership will develop a convenient means via internet, or telephone either
   thru the promotion of an MTF/clinic appointment cancellation line or use of the automated
   appointment reminder system to allow patients to cancel appointments so that No-Show rates
   can be minimized.
   3.11.4. Commanders may be notified of No-Shows of Active Duty members under their
   command. The MTF is not required to record these as disclosures under HIPAA, as this falls
   under the definition of treatment.
   3.11.5. MTF Commanders will ensure that only one No-Show policy is administered and
   applied consistently throughout the MTF so as to not confuse staff and patients with differing
   policies between clinics/departments.
      3.11.5.1. If required, plans to reduce no-show rates need be addressed and developed in
      the access management team meeting. If required, these plans can be developed for all
      clinics or individual clinics with No-Show problems depending on the extent of the issue.
   3.11.6. Providers/staff will document and follow-up on all No-Show patients to ensure
   patient wellness and to comply with Joint Commission (JC) requirements and/or
   Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) guidelines.
   3.11.7. The MTF staff will have processes in place to educate its patient population on No
   Show appointment processes.
3.12. Late Patient Arrival for Scheduled Appointment (Late-Show).
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                              23


   3.12.1. Definition: It is recommended that a Late Show is any patient who arrives at the
   clinic greater than 10 minutes after their scheduled appointment time. MTF clinical
   leadership has the freedom to choose an alternate definition of a late show based on their
   local requirements.
   3.12.2. The MTF, depending on the judgment of the clinic staff, the patient’s health status,
   and/or individual circumstances as to why the patient was late, may 1) place another patient
   in the Late-Show patient’s scheduled appointment time, 2) offer the Late-Show patient the
   opportunity to reschedule their appointment, or 3) allow the patient to wait for the provider to
   see them that day if the provider is available to avoid the need for another appointment.
       3.12.2.1. (Added-59MDW) If the patient is in Warriors in Transition Program or an
       Active Duty Service Member undergoing a Medical Board as indicated by the
       Registration Comment Field of CHCS/AHLTA patient:
          3.12.2.1.1. (Added-59MDW) The provider will have the option of seeing the patient
          immediately.
          3.12.2.1.2. (Added-59MDW) The patient will be offered to be seen during any no-
          show appointment times, or at the end of the clinical shift.
       3.12.2.2. (Added-59MDW) All other patient categories will be given the following
       options:
          3.12.2.2.1. (Added-59MDW) The provider will have the option of seeing the patient
          immediately.
          3.12.2.2.2. (Added-59MDW) The patient will be offered to be seen during any no-
          show appointment times, or at the end of the clinical shift.
          3.12.2.2.3. (Added-59MDW) With the assistance of clinic staff, the patient can be
          rescheduled if they choose and the provider concurs that rescheduling is medically
          appropriate.
   3.12.3. MTF Commanders will ensure that only one Late-Show policy is administered and
   applied consistently throughout the MTF so as to not confuse staff and patients with differing
   policies between clinics/departments.
   3.12.4. The MTF will educate its patient population on Late Show appointment processes.
3.13. Patient Cancellations.
   3.13.1. Definition: A patient cancellation is when a patient with a scheduled appointment
   notifies the MTF in sufficient time for the MTF to schedule another patient into the
   appointment slot, usually more than two hours prior to the appointment time.
   3.13.2. MTFs will develop patient centered processes to allow for easy cancellation of
   appointments such as a patient appointment cancellation telephone number, clearly defined
   appointment cancellation menu options, or telephone appointment reminder cancellations.
   3.13.3. MTFs will develop process to ensure that appointment cancellation notifications
   received either from phone answering machines or automated reports are translated back into
   CHCS in timely manner so that these patient cancelled appointments can be reopened for
   booking.
 24                                               AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


   3.13.4. It is recommended that cancellation telephone lines be available/open 24 hours a day,
   seven days a week.
   3.13.5. Patients will be informed that they have the option of cancelling by phone or online
   for appointments made online.
   3.13.6. The Access Manager/GPM will work with the Information Systems Officer to
   support and maintain the automated appointment reminder system if used. MTF leadership
   will ensure that there will be at least one functional person from appointing and one from
   information systems designated by name to support the automated appointment reminder
   system at each MTF if it is used.
   3.13.7. The MTF will educate and market its patient appointment cancellation procedures to
   its beneficiaries. Appointment cancellation phone numbers and processes should be clearly
   found/understood on MTF websites, appointment line messages and thru base newspapers
   and phone books.
3.14. Facility Cancellations.
   3.14.1. Definition: The facility cancels an available/open appointment or cancels a patient’s
   scheduled appointment. The intent of this action is to permanently remove the affected
   appointment slot(s) from the schedule. MTFs will take all necessary actions to minimize
   facility cancellations.
   3.14.2. MTFs will ensure schedule management processes govern all parts of the facility
   cancellation process to include who has authority; when this practice is authorized, and what
   feedback/reports are generated during facility cancellations.
   3.14.3. The MTF will inform affected patients of their appointment cancellation as soon as
   possible.
   3.14.4. All patients who had facility cancelled appointments will be offered a new
   appointment at the time they are informed of the cancellation. When possible, the patient
   should be rescheduled to meet the ATC Standard of their original appointment request. The
   ATC Standard is not met if the patient is not rescheduled or is rescheduled outside the access
   standard assigned to the original appointment request.
   3.14.5. If a patient was not informed of a facility cancelled appointment and presents at the
   MTF for care, the MTF will take all reasonable actions necessary to ensure that care is
   provided that same day.
3.15. Walk-in and Sick Call Appointing.
   3.15.1. Definitions: A Walk-in is a patient who seeks care without a scheduled appointment,
   arrives at the clinic, and is assigned a time to see the provider the same day. There is no
   ATC Standard for a walk-in appointment. Sick Call is reserved for an Active Duty member
   who arrives at a clinic that uses Sick Call as a regular, common time to receive healthcare.
   There is no access standard for sick call appointments.
   3.15.2. Walk-ins are not designed for use as a schedulable event. High utilization of Walk-
   ins can create data quality challenges for the MTF and make the process of
   measuring/explaining access, and assessing demand more complex. High rates of Walk-ins
   may also make business plan targeting difficult since they are unplanned events. However, if
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                              25


   clinics utilize the Walk-in or Sick Call function to get patients seen in a manner that is more
   timely and convenient for the patients, this is recognized as good customer service from the
   patient's perspective, e.g. active duty sick call. The MTF will make an informed decision as
   to the challenges and benefits of using Walk-in care and Sick Call to treat its patients.
   3.15.3. The practice of seeing high volumes of Walk-ins can complicate the patient flow
   process if MTF leadership does not ensure its clinic staff is properly trained and educated
   about access management. Use of Walk-ins will not be a substitute for active review and
   management of appointment schedules and telephone access to appointments.
   3.15.4. If MTFs choose to offer Walk-in care and/or Sick Call appointments, MTF
   leadership will provide guidance for clinic staff on the following: 1) How to coordinate
   walk-in care with PCM teams; 2) How to respond to patients requesting Walk-in services
   (either over the phone or in-person at the reception desk); 3) How to balance customer
   service at the reception desk for pre-scheduled versus Walk-in patients (queue and priority
   awareness); 4) How to manage patients waiting for extended periods of time in reception;
   and 5) Records availability.
   3.15.5. The MTF will educate its patient population on Walk-in and/or Sick Call processes
   as applicable.
   3.15.6. At end of day processing, Walk-in and Sick Call appointments will not have their
   appointment statuses changed to any other appointment status. This will ensure data quality
   on Walk-in care and Sick Call is maintained.
   3.15.7. At end of day processing, MTFs will change Kept status visits of ALHTA walk-in
   patients back to the status of Walk-in to maintain data quality. Patients who are walked into
   AHLTA are erroneously assigned a kept status on their visits by the AHLTA system. This is
   wrong and will have to be changed back to the status of Walk-in.
3.16. Splitting and Joining Appointments.
   3.16.1. MTFs are encouraged to split or join appointment slots to improve patient access.
   These booking functions allow MTFs to easily tailor lengths of appointment time and to
   create additional appointments so the provider’s time is used efficiently and the patient is
   scheduled for the appropriate time needed to provide their care.
   3.16.2. GPMs/clinic staff will coordinate the development of protocols for splitting and
   joining appointments.
   3.16.3. The Split function can be used to subdivide appointments of 20 minutes or greater.
3.17. Automatic Schedule Reconfiguration.
   3.17.1. MTF appointing and template managers will use the automatic schedule
   reconfiguration functionality of the appointing information system to improve access while
   decreasing the amount of time spent on manually managing/changing schedules.
   3.17.2. Reconfiguration will allow for a systematic changing of appointment types and detail
   codes and releasing of frozen appointments to maintain the correct mix of appointment types
   while optimizing appointment availability.
   3.17.3. This function will not be used to split and join appointments.
 26                                               AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


                                          Chapter 4

                                      DETAIL CODES

4.1. Use of Detail Codes.
   4.1.1. The purpose of detail codes is to assist appointing personnel to rapidly identify and
   search for requested slots on appointment schedules. The appointment information system
   enables appointing agents to search by detail code.
   4.1.2. MTFs may use detail codes to further define appointment type definitions on
   templates and schedules. There are approximately 240 Standard Detail Codes with over 60
   that describe procedures. An entire approved listing with definitions is in Attachment 5.
   4.1.3. Detail codes can be used as additional descriptors on appointment slots including: 1)
   Clinical resources to include equipment needed for the appointment; 2) Patient enrollment
   status (patient access types) for the patient needing the appointment; 3) Patient age ranges
   permitted in an appointment; 4) Detail codes to web enable appointment slots; 5) Patient
   education and counseling classes; 6) Readiness care slots; 7) Patient gender permitted in an
   appointment; and 8) Type of provider providing the care.
   4.1.4. If the standard appointment types, e.g. ROUT, SPEC, adequately define care to be
   provided in a slot, then detail codes will not be needed and any patient can be booked into an
   appointment.
   4.1.5. MTFs can use up to four detail codes on each appointment slot.
   4.1.6. Use of detail codes is optional. GPMs/clinic staff will decide which detail codes, if
   any, are required on various appointment slots
   4.1.7. MTFs will be careful using detail codes, as their extensive use (3-4 details codes per
   slot) may decrease access since it makes the appointing requirements more specific. Proper
   use of Patient Access Types, gender, and age codes can improve access and accurate
   appointing to certain types of beneficiary.
4.2. Use of Patient Access Types.
   4.2.1. Patient Access Type detail codes allow an appointment slot to be booked to a specific
   enrollment/eligibility status of patient.
   4.2.2. Use of Patient Access Type detail codes will ensure that Active Duty and TRICARE
   Prime receive priority of care IAW the TRICARE benefit.
   4.2.3. MTFs will use only one patient access type detail code per appointment slot. The
   information system will recognize only the first patient access type. This will also ensure
   appointing personnel correctly identify the type of patient to be appointed to a slot.
   4.2.4. Patient Access Type detail codes can be used in conjunction with TOL appointing to
   identify the appropriate enrollment status of patients booking web based appointments.
4.3. Use of Age Detail Codes.
   4.3.1. Age detail codes are the only detail codes that may be created by MTFs without
   approval by the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) or Service’s Headquarters.
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                             27


   4.3.2. MTFs can tailor appointment slots to allow patients of certain ages into these slots, by
   adding MTF defined age codes to the detail code field. The appointing and web appointing
   systems (TOL) automatically permit a patient in the age range defined by the MTF to be
   booked into that appointment slot. MTFs may use age detail codes to schedule various
   pediatric, adolescent, or geriatric care for their beneficiaries.
   4.3.3. Age codes will adhere to the following formatting standards and include a time buffer
   so patients can book early or late:
      4.3.3.1. Correct formats include an age range with a lower and upper limit and a hyphen.
   4.3.3.2. The letter M indicates age in months plus or minus 60 days. Example: 3M-6M
   represents a patient between 3 and 6 months of age.
      4.3.3.3. The letter D indicates age in days plus or minus 14 days. Example: 3D-21D
      represents a patient between 3 days and 21 days of age.
      4.3.3.4. The letter W indicates age in weeks plus or minus 14 days. Example: 1W-6W
      represents a patient between 1 and 6 weeks of age.
      4.3.3.5. A number alone indicates age in years plus or minus 30 days. Example: 0-12
      represents a patient between 0 and 12 years of age.
      4.3.3.6. A hyphen is the only allowable separator between the upper and lower age range
      4.3.3.7. The low and high numbers are inclusive and the low age must precede the upper
      age limit.
      4.3.3.8. Sites will add age detail codes to the Detail Code Table so that the system will
      recognize them. This practice reduces mis-booked appointments.
   4.3.4. Age defined detail codes may be used on appointments in conjunction with TRICARE
   Online (TOL) appointing to match patients by age to the correct web based appointments.
   4.3.5. The appointing information system and the web appointing system match the patient’s
   actual age to the age detail code on the appointment slot to automatically permit or deny
   services to specific ages of patients, e.g. a geriatric patient, age 80 cannot be booked into a
   pediatrics appointment slot templated with a 1-18 age detail code.
4.4. Use of Gender Detail Codes.
   4.4.1. Gender detail codes ensure that the appointing information system matches the correct
   gender to the correct appointment. Gender detail codes are as follows:
      4.4.1.1. “FE”-Female
      4.4.1.2. “MA”-Male
   4.4.2. Gender detail codes may be used in conjunction with TOL appointing to identify
   correct gender of patients booking web enabled appointments (e.g. appointments with “FE”
   will only display to female patients).
4.5. Use of Web Enabled (WEA) Detail Codes.
   4.5.1. MTFs will use the WEA detail code to identify all the appointment slots the MTF
   wants to make available for display and booking via the TOL appointing function. MTFs
   will web enable at least 80 percent of their primary care and select specialty clinic
 28                                              AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


   appointments to maximize use of TOL appointing. See AFMS Knowledge Exchange TOL
   Availability Metric for details about how this percentage is calculated.
   4.5.2. Appointment slots with WEA detail codes are available both to MTF appointing
   personnel and to TOL users on a first come, first serve basis for booking. The presence of a
   WEA detail code on an appointment slot does not prevent appointing personnel from
   booking these appointments through telephone or walk-in requests.
   4.5.3. Further guidance on TOL appointing processes can be found at the AFMS Knowledge
   Exchange under Health Benefits.
4.6. Use of Provider Book Only (PBO) Detail Codes.
   4.6.1. Definition: The PBO detail code is used if an individual provider needs to have
   control over booking a particular appointment slot. The use of the PBO detail code restricts
   booking by other members of the clinic and central appointing function either at the MTF or
   the multi-market office.
   4.6.2. Use of PBO detail codes is discouraged. However, if utilized, MTF leadership will
   develop guidelines on the application of the PBO detail codes.
4.7. Changing Detail Codes. Changing of detail codes is allowed only to users with the
appropriate security keys and in accordance with local policy.

          APPOINTMENT TEMPLATE PLANNING AND ADMINISTRATION

5.1. Responsibility for Template Management. MTF leadership will ensure efficient and
effective management of appointment templates.
5.2. Template Definition. A template is defined as an appointing schedule outline for a
provider in a clinic that has not been loaded and opened in the appointing information system.
Templates are developed ahead of loading and opening the schedule and assist access
managers/clinic staff in planning the correct supply (i.e. meet demand or target of the business
plan) of appointments and types to be available on schedules for patient booking. Templates
have no dates, only times.
5.3. Factors to Consider When Developing Templates. GPM/HCI/clinic staff will consider a
number of factors when developing the templates to include:
   5.3.1. Acuity and number of enrollees for which the clinic/FHE is responsible
   5.3.2. Number of non-enrolled “Must See” patients each provider is expected to treat (e.g.
   NATO, AD students, ROTC)
   5.3.3. Information system provider file and table processing parameters
   5.3.4. Clinic available space and equipment
   5.3.5. Special procedures the clinic performs
   5.3.6. Availability of support staff
   5.3.7. Clinic provider/support staff level of expertise in providing given levels of care on the
   schedule
   5.3.8. Actual numbers of appointments required on templates to meet ATC standards,
   seasonal demand, and business plan targets
   5.3.9. Availability of floaters and non-enrolled medical officers/providers for use as back-
   ups
   5.3.10. Others factors specific to the site
5.4. Factors to Consider When Developing Individual Provider Templates. When
developing individual provider templates, the GPM/clinical staff will consider the following
factors:
   5.4.1. Acuity and number of enrollees for which the provider is responsible
   5.4.2. Provider practice style
   5.4.3. Types of appointments required and the best time of day to schedule them
   5.4.4. Number of minutes required for each appointment type
   5.4.5. Number of appointments of each type required by day of the week and through the
   month
   5.4.6. Instructions to split and join appointments
 30                                                AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


   5.4.7. Instructions for what appointment types can be modified
   5.4.8. Options and recommendations for auto reconfiguration of appointment types
   5.4.9. What appointments can be web-enabled
   5.4.10. What appointments or templates are count and non-count
   5.4.11. The number and types of detail codes assigned to appointment slots
   5.4.12. Instructions to the patient
   5.4.13. Instructions to the booking clerk
   5.4.14. Other local pertinent factors
5.5. Effective Template Management. MTF leadership will ensure templates are effectively
managed so that:
   5.5.1. Individual workers developing templates for all clinics will be identified to the
   provider, GPM and clinic leadership.
   5.5.2. MTFs will develop processes to ensure that the provider’s time is used effectively,
   where the appointment schedule is derived from a template that is well planned and
   coordinated with the provider.
   5.5.3. Providers, to include primary, specialty and ancillary care will work closely with
   GPMs and clinic leadership to develop templates that optimize access, patient continuity and
   enhance the provider’s practice of medicine.
   5.5.4. Providers will review their templates at least semi-annually.
   5.5.5. Access Managers/GPMs will develop processes to ensure that the provider, clinic
   chief, and SGH have reviewed and acknowledged the most current templates and that this
   review/acknowledgement has been documented.
   5.5.6. A naming process is developed to ensure that all templates can be filed, archived,
   retrieved and shared among all MTF clinics and teams.

                                           Chapter 6

       APPOINTMENT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION

6.1. Appointment Schedule Definition. The appointment schedule is defined as the loaded and
opened template for a provider in a clinic in the appointing information system allowing for
appointments to be booked over a particular time period.
6.2. Schedule Management Responsibilities. MTFs will develop processes to ensure that
schedules are coordinated for provider review and final release of accurate schedules that
provide for the availability of adequate numbers of scheduled appointments to appointing staff
and beneficiaries. In this process, several factors and numerous decisions that impact the
availability of providers and clinic support staff prior to the final release of the providers’
schedules will be considered. Factors include:
   6.2.1. Number of days into the future that appointments are going to be available
   6.2.2. Meeting schedules
   6.2.3. Base exercises
   6.2.4. Work details, physical training, readiness training and other requirements
   6.2.5. Provider and support staff availability/ absences
   6.2.6. Space, equipment availability during the scheduling period
   6.2.7. Other environmental, technical impacts on schedules
   6.2.8. Availability of ancillary support (lab, radiology and pharmacy) and medical records
   especially if the MTF considers opening schedule for after hours or weekend clinics
   6.2.9. Replacement or back-up providers, i.e. Floaters, Non-enrolled Medical Officers, etc.
   6.2.10. Availability of appointments/open schedules of like type services in the MTF.
6.3. Clinic Leader Approval Responsibilities. Clinic leadership in collaboration with the
GPM has the responsibility for approving the providers’ clinic schedules for release.
6.4. Clinic Leader Schedule Release Responsibilities. Clinic leadership will ensure that
schedules are released to allow, at minimum, a continuous/moving 45 day supply of available
appointments for booking.
6.5. Identifying Meetings, Base Exercises, and Other Impacts.
   6.5.1. The Access Manager/GPM will work closely with MTF meeting organizers and MTF
   leadership to minimize the impact of meetings on the clinic's/FHE’s ability to provide patient
   care and to effectively manage their schedules.
   6.5.2. MTF leadership will coordinate with the base/wing to identify as early as possible the
   impact on MTF medical appointment availability due to the schedule and manning
   requirements of base exercises, physical training, changes in patients getting through base
   security (entry on base) and the number, dates and staffing requirements of base/work details.
6.6. Identifying Provider Absences (Leave, TDY, Other) and Schedule Change Requests.
 32                                              AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


   6.6.1. MTF/Clinic leadership will develop clear, consistence guidance to manage provider
   and support staff leave and TDYs in such a manner that does not negatively impact patient
   access to care or a team’s ability to sustain its continuity.
   6.6.2. Providers and clinic support staff are mandated to have all scheduled leaves, TDYs
   and absences submitted to clinic leadership NLT 60 days in advance of being taken.
   6.6.3. A schedule change request is defined as any change made to a provider’s schedule
   after it has been opened for booking. MTF/Clinic leadership will develop clear, consistent
   guidance and processes that providers will need follow to request a schedule change.
   6.6.4. MTF/Clinic leadership will monitor appointment schedule change requests with the
   goal of minimizing: 1) continuous/repeated changes to opened schedules, 2) changes causing
   facility cancellations, and 3) the rescheduling of patients.
6.7. Freezing Appointments.
   6.7.1. Freezing appointment slots is a local MTF decision and is permitted. It should be
   used with caution. Freezing appointments makes scheduled slots on appointment schedules
   not viewable to appointing agents. Care must be taken to avoid negatively impacting access
   and reducing the number of appointments available to appointing agents.
   6.7.2. Frozen appointments should be opened as soon as it is determined they can be made
   available for booking.
   6.7.3. MTFs will have documented processes in place explaining the purposes of why the
   MTF freezes appointments.
6.8. Contingency Operations. MTF leaders will establish written contingency plans IAW
AFMS guidance to provide guidance during the event of unexpected provider absences, decrease
of MTF supply of appointments and/or unanticipated increases in patient demand, to ensure ATC
standards for patients can be met with direct and/or network care resources. Examples include
utilizing non-enrolled providers serving in leadership positions, optimizing Flight Medicine
where capacity exists and employing Independent Duty Medical Technicians.
6.9. Schedule Coordination.
   6.9.1. Meetings will be conducted no less than every other week by schedule management
   personnel to review/coordinate all MTF primary care product lines to include Family Health,
   Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Flight Medicine and select specialty clinics to include Mental
   Health, Optometry, Physical Therapy, and Women’s Health clinics to discuss the upcoming
   scheduling period. There is no requirement for formal minutes or notes of these meeting
   proceedings. Topics of discussion will include but not be limited to:
       6.9.1.1. Providing numbers of available appointments, highlighting anticipated overages
       and gaps in supply of those appointments among the clinic personnel present.
       6.9.1.2. Sharing opportunities where individual clinics can work together to cross book
       patients to avoid sending referrals to the network.
       6.9.1.3. Sharing impacts on schedules to include provider and support staff absences,
       upcoming meetings, exercises, classes, seasonal events and space requirements.
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                              33


      6.9.1.4. Coordination of telephone coverage for the upcoming scheduling period; in
      order to devise virtual or real call center support to peak and down times.
   6.9.2. MTF leadership will ensure that the Access Manager/GPM has access to review all
   MTF clinics’ current and past templates and schedules. This includes primary, specialty and
   ancillary care clinics and services.
   6.9.3. Each MTF will designate at least one individual that will be able to review and
   analyze all MTF clinics’ templates and schedules with the goal of coordinating care among
   clinics and teams, in order to improve access, reduce gaps in service and reduce care referred
   to the network.
   6.9.4. In larger MTFs with secondary and tertiary special care clinics, MTF leadership will
   mandate that monthly meetings be held to discuss templating and scheduling issues and
   opportunities similar to above.
6.10. Information System Usage.
   6.9.10.1. All medical clinics excluding dental clinics of MTFs will use CHCS if they
   schedule patient appointments. This will ensure that there is visibility of provider time and to
   allow data feeds to the Medical Expense Reporting System (MEPRS), Third Party Collection
   System and other management reports.
   6.9.10.2. Clinics to include primary, specialty and ancillary care clinics of any AFMS MTFs
   are not permitted to use ledger books or meeting/personal scheduling software such as
   Outlook to maintain appointment schedules and/or to book medical appointments for
   beneficiaries.
 34                                               AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


                                          Chapter 7

                                    OPEN ACCESS (OA)

7.1. Open Access Definition. OA appointing is a process of developing schedules and booking
medical appointments, designed to offer each patient requesting Family Health, primary care or
specialty care services an appointment within 24 hours. However, if the patient does not desire
an Open Access appointment, appointments on ensuing days (Good Backlog Appointments) will
be available and offered. To ensure consistency across the AFMS, MTFs using the OA
appointing methodology will give patients an appointment or resolve their health care needs
during their initial request or telephone call.
   7.1.1. Family Health Teams/Elements, Primary and Specialty Care Clinics using OA
   appointing will have ample supply of appointments available to accommodate their patient’s
   needs based on initial and continuous demand analysis. Clinic leaders will work closely with
   their GPM, HCI, and population health staff to determine the best mix of appointment types
   and appropriate numbers given the day of the week and the time of year.
7.2. References. The MHS Guide for Access Success should be readily available to all
stakeholders as the MTF implements this open access model of appointing: This reference will
be considered recommended reading for members of the access management team and should be
included in their orientation to open access appointing.
7.3. Scope.
   7.3.1. This guidance is applicable to all AFMS MTF clinics.
   7.3.2. MTFs contemplating implementation of OA appointing will consider numerous
   processes that impact this method's success. These processes include the MTF telephone
   system; variations in patient demand; provider staff stability to include summer Permanent
   Change of Station (PCS) rotation schedules; operations tempo; staffing level; graduate
   medical education programs; patient acuity; MTF inpatient versus ambulatory
   responsibilities; dedicated data analysis support; GPM/HCI capabilities and knowledge;
   experience of appointing staff; medical records availability; and provider/staff commitment
   or "buy-in."
   7.3.3. This guidance is applicable to OA clinics contemplating OA appointing with the
   corresponding Medical Expense and Personnel Reporting System (MEPRS) codes defined
   as:
       7.3.3.1. Family Health Teams/Elements– BGA
       7.3.3.2. Pediatrics - BDA/BDB
       7.3.3.3. Flight Medicine - BJA
       7.3.3.4. General Internal Medicine – BAA
       7.3.3.5. Any other MEPRS B-level clinics to include primary care or specialty care
       product lines.
   7.3.4. The smallest level organization in the MTF that can implement OA appointing are
   teams or clinics having at least two full-time privileged providers to include Family Health
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                              35


   Team, Internal Medicine Clinic, Flight Medicine Clinic, Pediatrics Team/Clinic or at the
   specialty clinic level. Individual PCMs or specialists are not allowed to enter into OA
   appointing.
   7.3.5. All Family Health Teams and Elements may enter into Open Access appointing.
       7.3.5.1. Family Health Teams may use the OPAC type to satisfy the 90 centrally
       available (bookable) appointments total per week per provider when the provider is
       available in clinic the entire week requirement as directed in AFI 44-171 Patient
       Centered Medical Home Family Health Operations.
7.4. Roles and Responsibilities.
   7.4.1. AFMSA’s Access to Care Program, Health Benefits Branch, (AFMSA/SG3SA), will
   act as the functional owner of all OA appointing guidance and performance measurement
   and/or metric activities in the AFMS.
7.5. AFMS Open Access Appointing Methodology. In order that consistency of service and
performance measurement can be applied, all AFMS MTF clinics engaged in OA appointing will
adhere to the following guidance:
   7.5.1. Use of the Open Access (OPAC) Appointment Type.
       7.5.1.1. The OPAC standard appointment type will be used to offer patients acute,
       routine, wellness, specialty, procedure or follow-up services within 24 hours (1,440
       minutes) of their initial request. Every effort will be made to allow patients to see their
       PCM or specialist within 24 hours (1,440 minutes) of their original request for care by
       using the OPAC appointment type.
       7.5.1.2. It is recommended that Family Health Elements, other primary care and
       specialty care clinics adequately forecast the number of OPAC appointments required on
       their schedules. The industry norms indicate that clinic schedules may contain between
       60 to 70percent OPAC appointment slots. However, this practice of including OPAC
       appointments on the schedule should not open the team or clinic into a full "walk-in" type
       service.
       7.5.1.3. To the greatest extent possible, all of the patient’s issues will be addressed in a
       single visit to minimize the need for unnecessary future appointments/repeat visits.
       Patients may be routed through a Triage Team or Triage Nurse for same day service if
       utilized, and if so, processes must be in place to ensure completion of those types of
       services by close of business, i.e. nurse triage processes must ensure patients get the same
       day care that they need on their first phone call by close of business.
       7.5.1.4. To search for the OPAC appointment type, appointing personnel will use the
       ACUTE Access to Care (ATC) Category in the CHCS Managed Care Program (MCP)
       that is mapped to the 24-hour ATC Standard.
   7.5.2. Appointment Types Used for AFMS OA appointing. The standard appointment types
   “allowed” for OA appointing are OPAC, ACUT, ROUT, PCM, WELL, SPEC, PROC, EST,
   GRP. If the other "allowed" appointment types (other than OPAC) are utilized, they will be
   used in accordance with the operational definitions described in chapter 3.2 of this
   Instruction. These other “allowed” appointment types will assist clinic staffs in setting aside
   times to book patients for specific services. Per the functionality of CHCS, Acute, Routine,
36                                                AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


  Wellness, Specialty and Future ATC Categories/CHCS Searches may have to be employed to
  search for and book these "allowed" appointment types. OA clinics using all of these other
  appointment types may see these same ATC Categories on their ATC Summary Reports. It
  is at the discretion of the clinic to use one or all of the appointment types from this "allowed"
  standard appointment type group.
     7.5.2.1. Use of the $ suffix on all "allowable" appointment types is at the discretion of
     the MTF, but is not recommended as it lessens access, since $ suffix appointments are not
     viewable by TRICARE Online users.
  7.5.3. Appointing agents will use the Acute ATC Category/CHCS search to book OPAC
  appointments.
  7.5.4. Good Backlog Appointment Slot Definition. A Good Backlog appointment slot will
  be used for patients who decline an offer for OPAC appointments within 24 hours in favor of
  an appointment on a future date other than within 24 hours of the request, or for provider
  directed appointments to be scheduled at a future time, e.g. wellness visits, follow-ups, initial
  specialty visits, procedures, group appointments.
  7.5.5. Good Backlog Templating and Scheduling Methods. The AFMS recommends four
  (4) methods to template and schedule Good Backlog appointment slots. These methods
  consist of the exclusive use of (1) OPAC, (2) OPAC-GDBL; (3) EST-GDBL or (4) a
  combination of one of these first three methods and one, or all, of the “allowed” appointment
  types to include ACUT, ROUT, PCM, WELL, SPEC, PROC, EST or GRP. So that
  consistency of process is maintained, OA MTFs will use only one of the four methods
  described below.
     7.5.5.1. Method One. Use OPAC appointment type only (OPAC). In this method
     MTFs will only use the OPAC appointment type without detail codes to template and
     schedule Good Backlog appointments for any kind of health care need, be if for acute,
     routine, wellness, specialty, procedure, follow-up or group care visits. Using the Acute
     ATC Category/CHCS search, appointing agents will first search for and offer the patient
     an OPAC appointment within 24 hours. If a patient refuses the OPAC appointment
     offered within 24 hours, appointing agents will remain with the same search, meaning
     that they will not back out of the current Acute ATC Category/CHCS search, and select
     an OPAC appointment past 24 hours. If the OPAC appointment is selected outside the 24
     hour, 1,440 minute, Acute ATC Standard, and there are available slots inside this
     standard, the clerk will document a patient refusal due to patient preference per the
     prompts in CHCS. CHCS will annotate this booked appointment as a Patient Refusal due
     to patient preference on the ATC Summary Report.
         7.5.5.1.1. Advantages of OPAC only for booking good backlog:
             7.5.5.1.1.1. Simple to template, only one appointment type for appointing agents
             to learn but may have different durations.
             7.5.5.1.1.2. Customer focused, as there is no differentiation between OPAC with
             a 24 hour standard and OPAC Good Backlog appointment slots which are booked
             into the future. OPAC is used for care to be provided within 24 hours or Good
             Backlog appointments.
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                        37


            7.5.5.1.1.3. Appointing agents are not required to change the appointment type to
            correspond with an initial Acute Access to Care Category/CHCS search. Most
            times when booked, a Met or a patient refusal will be documented.
            7.5.5.1.1.4. Can be displayed on TRICARE Online (TOL) appointing schedules.
        7.5.5.1.2. Disadvantages of OPAC:
            7.5.5.1.2.1. There is no upfront template and schedule planning to identify the
            proper number or mix of Good Backlog appointments and OPACs with a 24 hour
            standard.
            7.5.5.1.2.2. There is no clear identification on the schedule of Good Backlog
            appointments for appointing agents or providers.
            7.5.5.1.2.3. There is a potential that there will be no preservation of 24 hour
            access, meaning all appointments on future days will be booked.
            7.5.5.1.2.4. TOL appointment display does not differentiate between same day
            and Good Backlog appointments. All available OPAC appointments will be
            booked within 24 hours.
            7.5.5.1.2.5. Appointing agents cannot perform an appointment search by detail
            code.
            7.5.5.1.2.6. There is no easy way to measure usage as the appointment slots
            designated for Good Backlog (OPAC) as they are the same standard appointment
            type as for 24 hour (OPAC) and cannot be differentiated on various canned CHCS
            reports or various reports listed on the TRICARE Operations Center (TOC).
     7.5.5.2. Method Two. Use OPAC appointment type with the Good Backlog (GDBL)
     detail code (OPAC-GDBL). In this method MTFs will identify Good Backlog
     appointments on their templates and schedules by using the OPAC appointment type in
     conjunction with the GDBL detail code. Using the Acute ATC Category/CHCS search,
     appointing agents will first search for and offer the patient an OPAC appointment within
     24 hours. If a patient refuses an OPAC appointment within 24 hours, appointing agents
     will remain in the same search, meaning that they will not back out of the current Acute
     ATC Category/CHCS search, and select an OPAC-GDBL slot outside 24 hours. If the
     OPAC-GDBL appointment slot is booked and is outside the 24 hour, (1,440 minute),
     Acute ATC Standard, and there are available slots inside this standard, the clerk will
     document a patient refusal due to patient preference per the prompts in CHCS. CHCS
     will annotate this booking as a Patient Refusal on the ATC Summary Report.
        7.5.5.2.1. Advantages of OPAC-GDBL:
            7.5.5.2.1.1. Allows upfront template and schedule planning, e.g. a 70 percent
            OPACs within 24 hours/30 percent Good Backlog (OPAC-GDBL) appointment
            ratio can be maintained.
            7.5.5.2.1.2. Easy for appointing agents and providers to identify slots on
            templates and schedules.
            7.5.5.2.1.3. Appointing agents are not required to change the appointment type to
            correspond with an initial Acute Access to Care/CHCS search. Most times when
38                                               AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


            such appointments are booked, a met or patient refusal will be documented.
            7.5.5.2.1.4. Appointment booking is faster since appointment types do not have
            to be changed.
            7.5.5.2.1.5. An appointment search by detail code can be performed to find Good
            Backlog appointments.
            7.5.5.2.1.6. OPAC-GDBL does not have to be frozen, since they are easily
            identified.
        7.5.5.2.2. Disadvantages of OPAC-GDBL:
            7.5.5.2.2.1. There is less patient choice of Good Backlog appointments with this
            method.
            7.5.5.2.2.2. There is no easy way to measure usage as the appointment slots
            designated for Good Backlog (OPAC-GDBL) are the same standard appointment
            type as for OPAC appointments meant for booking within 24 hours and cannot be
            differentiated on various canned CHCS reports or on the MHS reports.
            7.5.5.2.2.3. More templating and scheduling work is required to add the detail
            code GDBL to the OPAC appointment slots.
            7.5.5.2.2.4. TOL will not display OPAC appointments with the GDBL detail
            code.
     7.5.5.3. Method Three. Use the Established appointment type (EST) with the GDBL
     detail code (EST-GDBL).          In this method MTFs will identify Good Backlog
     appointments on their templates and schedules by using the EST appointment type in
     conjunction with the GDBL detail code. Using the Acute ATC Category/CHCS search,
     appointing agents will first search for and offer the patient an OPAC appointment within
     24 hours. If a patient refuses an OPAC appointment within 24 hours, appointing agents
     will remain with the same search, meaning that they will not back out of the current
     Acute ATC Category/CHCS search; they will go to the all search and select an EST-
     GDBL slot not within 24 hours of the initial request that fulfills the patient’s need. If the
     EST-GDBL appointment slot is selected outside the 24 hour, (1,440 minute), Acute ATC
     Standard, the clerk will be prompted to change the appointment type from EST to OPAC
     and will document a patient refusal due to patient preference per the prompts in CHCS.
     CHCS will annotate this booking as a Patient Refusal on the ATC Summary Report.
        7.5.5.3.1. Advantages of EST-GDBL:
            7.5.5.3.1.1. Allows upfront template and schedule planning, e.g. a 70 percent
            OPAC appointments within 24 hours and/30 percent Good Backlog (EST-GDBL)
            appointment ratio can be maintained.
            7.5.5.3.1.2. Easy for appointing agents and providers to identify slots on
            templates and schedules.
            7.5.5.3.1.3. EST-GDBL slots are easy to freeze and unfreeze.
            7.5.5.3.1.4. Separates provider directed follow-up (EST) slots from patient
            wanting a Good Backlog appointment (EST-GDBL).
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                          39


            7.5.5.3.1.5. EST-GDBL allows for an easier measure of usage.         These
            appointment slots are a different standard appointment type from the OPAC
            appointment type to be booked within 24 hours and can be differentiated on
            various canned CHCS reports or on the MHS reports and tools.
        7.5.5.3.2. Disadvantages of EST-GDBL:
            7.5.5.3.2.1. There is less patient choice of Good Backlog appointments.
            7.5.5.3.2.2. More templating and scheduling work is required to add the detail
            code GDBL to the EST appointment type.
            7.5.5.3.2.3. TOL will not display EST appointments with the GDBL detail code.
            7.5.5.3.2.4. Appointing agents are required to change the EST appointment type
            to OPAC in order to book the appointment. CHCS requires the appointment type
            to correspond with an initial Acute Access to Care Category/CHCS search. There
            is a need to issue security keys for this activity.
     7.5.5.4. Method Four. Allows schedulers to use a combination of either method 1, 2, or
     3 as stated above for booking good backlog and using one or all of the “allowed”
     standard appointment types on the schedule to include PCM, WELL, SPEC, PROC, EST
     or GRP.
        7.5.5.4.1. If using method 4, schedulers will use the standard appointment types of
        ROUT, PCM, WELL, SPEC, PROC, EST or GRP in accordance with the definitions
        as listed in Chapter 3.2 of this Instruction.
        7.5.5.4.2. The advantages of using one or all of the appointment types to include
        ROUT, PCM, WELL, SPEC, PROC, EST or GRP allows for their immediate
        recognition by appointment appointing agents to schedule various services that the
        clinic offers other than OA or good backlog appointments. Templates and schedules
        can be easily apportioned to allow for advanced planning of services and which
        supports the provider’s practice patterns.
        7.5.5.4.3. If using method 4, appointing agent can use two methods to search for and
        book ROUT, PCM, WELL, SPEC, EST and GRP appointments. They are:
            7.5.5.4.3.1. Use the Acute ATC Category to search for and book these
            appointments. By using the Acute ATC Category/CHCS search, the clerk will be
            required to change the appointment type of ROUT, PCM, WELL, SPEC, PROC,
            EST, or GRP to the OPAC appointment type. When using this searching method,
            OA clinics may want to instruct the appointing agent that these ROUT, PCM,
            WELL, SPEC, PROC, EST, or GRP appointment slots can be searched for and
            booked using the Acute ATC Category/CHCS search instead of their traditional
            appointing ATC Category.
            7.5.5.4.3.2. Use the appropriate/traditional ATC Category/CHCS Search. If the
            appointing agent determines the patient requires (1) a specialty care consult or
            procedure visit, (2) a provider directed follow-up or group visit or a (3) wellness
            visit, the appointing agent can use the appropriate traditional search to book the
            needed appointment. The appointing agent can use the appropriate Routine,
            Wellness, Specialty, or Future ATC Category/CHCS Searches. By doing so,
40                                                AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


            there is no need for the clerk to change the appointment type from ROUT, PCM,
            WELL, SPEC, PROC, EST, or GRP to the OPAC appointment type.
  7.5.6. Guidance on Use of Detail Codes.
     7.5.6.1. In accordance with CHCS functionality, up to 4 detail codes can be used on each
     appointment slot. OA clinics shall use detail codes sparingly. Detail codes are used to
     restrict access to the appointment slot for a particular need such as designating that slot
     for a particular procedure, reserving a slot for a specific education class, or to permit only
     a certain group of beneficiary to be booked into the slot, such as Active Duty or
     TRICARE Prime.
  7.5.6.2. Use of detail codes to restrict access to beneficiary categories other than Active
  Duty and TRICARE Prime beneficiaries will be beneficial to OA clinics to ensure that the
  mandates from the 32 CFR199.17 are maintained for these enrolled beneficiaries.
     7.5.6.3. Use of detail codes will be IAW with Chapter 4 of this Instruction.
     7.5.6.4. Two detail codes are meant to facilitate OA appointing. They will be used as
     follows:
         7.5.6.4.1. GDBL/Good Backlog Detail Code. This detail code will be used to code a
         Good Backlog appointment slot. This slot will be used for patients who decline an
         offered OPAC appointment within 24 hours in favor of an appointment on a future
         date other than the same day of the request, or provider directed future appointments,
         e.g. follow-ups, initial specialty visits, procedures, group appointments. The GDBL
         detail code can be used in combination with the ROUT, PCM, WELL, SPEC, PROC,
         EST or GRP standard appointment types "allowed" for OA appointing.
         7.5.6.4.2. CB/Cross Book Detail Code. The CB detail can be used to designate
         appointment slots in OA Family Health Team or Primary care or Specialty Care
         Clinic PCM's or providers schedules for patients who are unable to get care with their
         own PCM or specialist due to their absence. The CB detail code will only be used
         during the absence of one or more members of the same Family Health Team,
         primary care or specialty care clinic to ensure that beneficiaries will not be without
         access to care. The CB detail code appointment slots should be added to "floater/fill-
         in" provider's or regular clinic staff provider's schedules to equal the same number of
         daily slots that would have been made available if the missing provider(s) slots were
         on the schedule, e.g. if the missing provider(s) daily available slots were 18, then 18
         CB detail coded slots should be added to "floater" or staff provider's schedules to
         maintain the same number of slots for the cared for population.

    VERIFYING AND UPDATING PATIENT INFORMATION AND ELIGIBILITY

8.1. Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) Checks and Updates. A
complete DEERS check and update of patient demographic information will be accomplished at
each patient interface, including booking via telephone or in person, telephone consultation
requests, and check-in by a patient for scheduled, Walk-In, or Sick Call appointments. The only
exception will be for telephone contacts made by providers at home. Demographic information
includes updating the patient's current address, current telephone number, in the local appointing
information system registration data base.
8.2. Eligibility Questions. Appointing personnel will refer any questions related to the patient's
eligibility for care and enrollment status to the TRICARE Operations and Patient Administration
(TOPA) Flight/Branch for review and determination.
8.3. Third Party Collection Questions. Third party collection questions should be referred to
the Resource Management Flight/Branch.

                          ASSIGNING APPOINTING STATUSES

9.1. Appointment Status Definitions. MTF staff will determine the status for each
appointment as accurately as possible. Appointment statuses will be consistently applied
according to the following definitions:
   9.1.1. Kept: The patient has a booked appointment, arrives at the clinic, and is treated by the
   provider.
   9.1.2. Patient Cancellation: A patient with a scheduled appointment notifies the MTF in
   sufficient time for the MTF to schedule another patient into the appointment slot, usually
   more than two hours prior to the appointment time.
   9.1.3. Walk-in: The patient does not have a scheduled appointment, arrives at the clinic, and
   is assigned a time to see the provider the same day. This status will not be changed at End-
   Of-Day (EOD) processing.
   9.1.4. Sick Call: An Active Duty member arrives at a clinic for a pre-arranged block of time
   for acute care. This status will not be changed at EOD processing.
   9.1.5. No-Show: An appointment where a patient does not keep a scheduled appointment or
   cancels less than two hours prior to a scheduled appointment.
   9.1.6. Facility Cancellation: The MTF cancels an available/open appointment or cancels a
   patient’s scheduled appointment. This action will permanently remove the affected
   appointment slot(s) from the schedule.
   9.1.7. Left Without Being Seen (LWOBS): The patient has a booked appointment, arrives at
   the FHE/clinic, and is checked in, but decides to leave without seeing the provider.
   9.1.8. Pending: The MTF appointment information system assigns this status for an
   appointment that has been booked for a patient for a future date or time. All Pending
   appointments must be assigned one of the final encounter statuses in order to complete EOD
   Processing.
   9.1.9. Admin (ADMIN): The Admin status is used on appointments or telephone consults
   that do not represent actual contact with a patient. The status must be assigned in End of Day
   Processing. Examples of Admin statuses are test appointments or telephone consults created
   to view system functionality or data. A transaction with this status will not be passed to
   ADM or AHLTA and therefore will not be coded or included in the SADR.
   9.1.10. Occasions of Service (OCC-SVC): The OCC-SVC status on a patient appointment
   indicates no medical decision was made by a privileged provider who is directly responsible
   for the management of care for the patient. Per AFMS Instruction, the OCC-SVC status will
   no longer be used on telephone consults. The OCC-SVC transaction will pass from CHCS to
   ADM, is always non-count, and may be used to assess level of effort. ADM and AHLTA do
   not recognize OCC-SVC as an appointment for encounter completion. Therefore this status
   will NOT prompt the provider to code the encounter and will avoid generating a SADR.
   Examples of OCC-SVC are provider to provider consultation, and pharmacy refills, etc.
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                              43


  9.1.11. Telephone Consultation (TEL-CON): When a provider answers a telephone consult
  in AHLTA, the provider will be asked by the system, “Does this meet the outpatient visit
  criteria?” If the provider is a technician, nurse, or other non-count provider or the clinic is a
  non-count clinic (per the Clinic Profile), the response will be defaulted to No (non-count) and
  cannot be changed in AHLTA. If the provider is a privileged provider and the clinic is a
  count clinic, the default will be a Yes (count). The provider should change the response to
  No if it does not meet the visit criteria. The telephone consult data will be sent to CHCS with
  the workload type set according to the criteria above. The appointment status on the
  telephone consult record is defaulted by the system to TEL-CON if count and to ADMIN if
  non-count. Clinic staff may correct the workload type and appointment status in ADM to
  reflect actual workload as follows: correct to non-count and a status of ADMIN if the
  consult has not been sent on the SADR; correct to non-count and CANCEL if the consult has
  been sent on the SADR (this will cancel the transaction on the SADR). For assistance
  determining what constitutes non-count vs. count criteria for TEL-CON contact your local
  MEPRS personnel.

                           END-OF-DAY (EOD) PROCESSING

10.1. EOD processing will be completed at the end of each business day.
10.2. Clinic leadership will appoint one individual assigned to the clinic that is responsible
for the quality and the timeliness of data submitted for EOD processing.
10.3. All workload types (count/non-count) on appointment slots will accurately match the
care provided.
10.4. All providers registered on the final appointment status will match the provider who
actually saw the patient.
10.5. All appointment statuses input during EOD processing will adhere to the operational
definitions of Chapter 9 of this guidance. They will also reflect the final status of the
appointment in accordance with the special guidance of identifying Late Shows, No-Shows,
Patient Cancellations and Walk-ins as documented in Chapter 3 of this guidance.

                 APPOINTING INFORMATION SYSTEM OPERATIONS

11.1. Division, Clinic, and Provider Profiles.
   11.1.1. MTF leadership will clearly identify those individuals with the responsibility to
   establish and maintain division, clinic and provider profiles in the MTF appointing
   information system(s).
   11.1.2. MTF leadership will ensure these individuals are adequately trained for this
   responsibility. Training courses and information on division, clinic and provider profiles can
   be found at the AFMS Knowledge Exchange under Health Benefits.
   11.1.3. MTF division, clinic and provider profiles will be established and maintained to
   support MHS, AFMS policies, and AFIs. All pertinent information regarding profiles can be
   found at the AFMS Knowledge Exchange under Health Benefits.
Note: For sites deemed Family Health Initiative sites there are special instructions for building
division, clinic and provider profiles. Refer to the Patient Centered Medical Home and Family
Health Operations AFI. These functions would include but are not limited to:

                                         Chapter 12

                             ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT

12.1. Enrollment of Beneficiaries.
12.1.1. Enrollment operations are governed by the current TRICARE Operations Manual.
Internet Link it TRICARE Manuals.
   12.1.2. MTF leadership will develop programs to promptly enroll TRICARE Prime
   beneficiaries to the MTF. The enrollment process begins when a TRICARE Prime eligible
   beneficiary chooses to receive healthcare from the MTF. The MTF will need to work closely
   with the Managed Care Support Contractor (MCSC) and beneficiary to ensure that
   enrollment is successfully achieved.
   12.1.3. MTFs will provide the MCSC with a current listing of all Primary Care Locations
   with associated groups and a current listing of Direct Care PCMs. The list(s) will be made
   available for the beneficiary’s use for the initial selection or change of a PCM. The MCSC
   will provide guidance to the enrollee in selecting a Primary Care Location or a PCM, as
   appropriate given MTF guidance in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and the
   CHCS PCM capacities.
   12.1.4. The MTF will ensure that the CHCS PCM, Group and Location capacity parameters
   are maintained to their most up to date levels. This is important as all Direct Care TRICARE
   Prime enrollees shall be enrolled to the MTF’s Primary Care Locations by the MCSCs, based
   on compliance with these specifications set forth in the CHCS PCM files and tables and the
   MTF MOU. Prospective enrollees or categories of enrollees shall be assigned a Direct Care
   PCM or offered a choice of civilian network PCMs based on these MTF set capacities in
   CHCS.
12.2. Assignment of Beneficiaries.
   12.2.1. All AFMS MTF will assign by name TRICARE Prime beneficiaries to Primary Care
   Managers. Primary care manager assignment is essential for population health management
   and continuity of care to succeed. The PCM is responsible for managing the health of a
   group of individuals assigned to him or her throughout the continuum of care.
   12.2.2. A primary care manager can generally be a Family Practitioner, Internist,
   Pediatrician, Flight Medicine Officer or general medical officer. With appropriate
   supervision by a designed privileged provider, a nurse practitioner, nurse midwife, physician
   assistant or family practice resident may also serve as a PCM. Specialists can also serve as
   PCMs if the MDG Commander has given them the privilege to do so.
   12.2.3. The MTF leadership will work closely with their TRICARE Operations/Access
   Managers/GPMs and medical staff members to develop assignment processes that enhance
   continuity, access, and the quality of patient care. The assignment process must also be
   balanced against the need for providers to practice within the scope of their training and
   experience.
   12.2.4. To have a successful enrollee assignment process, the Access Manager/GPM/HCI
   and medical staff leadership will be required to know the mission, the total number by
48                                               AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


  beneficiary category, the acuity level of these patients, their population’s demographics, and
  the disease states of their enrollees. Enrollment panels will need to be balanced between
  teams/groups and between PCMs with varying experience levels and training needs. MTF
  leadership will need to develop fact based assignment and analysis processes using all these
  factors to ensure that individual enrollee assignments and capacities are fair, and effective.
  The PCMs should be engaged in this process.
  12.2.5. If there are a substantial number of non-enrollees and other demand, their impact on
  the capacity of PCMs must be clarified. At a minimum MTF leadership/Access
  Managers/GPMs need to know the following:
     12.2.5.1. Enrollees per PCM.
     12.2.5.2. Enrollees per Clinic/Group/Team.
     12.2.5.3. Estimated volume of other visits (non-enrolled) per month per PCM.
     12.2.5.4. Estimated volume of other visits per month per Clinic.
  12.2.6. Numbers of enrollees assigned to each PCM will be based on the factors above and
  the ratios as set forth in the Air Force Medical Service Enrollment Ratios per Provider, by
  Specialty Chart in Appendix F of this guidance.
  12.2.7. If enrollee capacity exceeds supply for the MTF, at no time will enrollees be
  involuntarily reassigned to network PCMs. MTF leadership is asked to consult with
  AFMOA or AFMSA if it appears that enrollments need to reduced.

   13.1.1. The MTF Commander will appoint the GPM as the primary operational, and
   whenever possible with the administrative control of appointing personnel. The GPM will be
   responsible for reporting oversight of the appointing telephony management processes,
   measures and recommending access improvement strategies to the MTF Commander as
   necessary.
   13.1.2. When developing a responsive appointing telephony management program, the
   GPM, population health and clinical support personnel should consider the following
   processes that may have impact on performance in this area:
      13.1.2.1. Health care demands on the MTF’s supported population with its seasonal
      fluctuations.
      13.1.2.2. Beneficiary and staff satisfaction.
      13.1.2.3. Performance planning targets.
      13.1.2.4. Supervision of call center operations.
      13.1.2.5. Telephone system implementation and coordination.
      13.1.2.6. Call center staffing.
      13.1.2.7. Applicable call center agent and management training.
      13.1.2.8. Monitoring of call center agent’s performance by listening to calls.
      13.1.2.9. Impact of base exercises and world-wide deployment commitments on call
      center operations.
      13.1.2.10. Call center metric analysis support availability/capability.
      13.1.2.11. Infrastructure limitations (e.g. call center facility and equipment).
   13.1.3. The GPM and population health staff, in concert with the clinical support personnel
   team, will conduct an ongoing demand analysis for the daily, monthly and seasonal health
   care needs of the MTF’s enrolled patient population and its applicable non-enrolled
   beneficiaries to facilitate future demand needs on call center operations.
13.2. Telephonic Access Management Duties.
   13.2.1. The GPM and Call Center Manager will perform their applicable telephonic access
   management duties pursuant to published job descriptions. These managers will ensure that
   the MTF has operating instructions, policies and continuity folders/books include appointing
   telephony management operation and reporting guidelines.
   13.2.2. Call center management responsibilities include: Schedule Employees, Coach
   Employees, Set Service Level, Understand quality and quantity metrics, Determine incoming
   contact centers behavior, Forecast call volume, Determine staff requirements, Build teams

   and Train agents, Manage qualitative and quantitative service requirements, Manage human
   resource issues, Monitor agents’ performance and Leverage technologies to its fullest.
   13.2.3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are those used to track call center performance
   against the MTF mission requirement of providing access to care. KPI should include: Call
   Volume, Number of Abandoned Calls, Number of Calls Answered, Percent of Abandoned
   Calls, Service Level, Average Speed of Answer, Average Call Talk Time, After Call Work,
   Handle Time and Utilization. The KPIs for which targets have been established include:
       13.2.3.1. Percent of Abandoned Calls - Less than or Equal to 18%.
       13.2.3.2. Service Level – 90% of Calls Answered within 90 Seconds.
       13.2.3.3. Average Speed of Answer – Less than or Equal to 45 Seconds.
       13.2.3.4. Average Talk Time – Between 3 to 5 minutes.
       13.2.3.5. Utilization – Greater than or Equal to 70%.
13.3. Installation and Sustainment Responsibilities.
   13.3.1. The Air Force appointed the Air Force Network Integration Center (AFNIC) to work
   with AF/SG staff and CITS PMO to promote the smart investment of sustainable voice
   systems that meet the medical communities’ voice processing need, while creating integrated
   network architecture. The Air Force functional communities are required to provide for the
   initial implementation and sustainment of the new ACD Systems until they are funded
   through the POM (normally not more than two years). MAJCOM/SC’s are responsible for
   long-term lifecycle costs, and ensuring out-year funding request reflect the requirements to
   support medical voice processing as a part of the Air Force mission.
   13.3.2. The TELMOD office (AFMSA/SG6I) will be responsible for scheduling the system
   installation, call center management training and technical system operation training during
   system installation/cut-over. AFMSA/SG6I will also provide metrics analysis for Air Force
   Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs).       MTFs unable to automatically send metrics to
   AFMSA/SG6 Applications Support will provide metrics data manually every month to
   AFMSA/SG6I for analysis. AFMSA/SG6I will be responsible for ensuring that the new
   systems being have the appropriate ports are provided to enable metrics to be automatically
   transmitted to AFMSA/SG6 Applications Support.
   13.3.3. AFMSA/SG6 Applications Support will collect the automated metric data sent by
   MTFs. The office will be responsible for producing a monthly push report that summarizes
   key metrics for each MTF. AFMSA/SG3SA will define which metrics will be summarized
   on the push reports and the report distribution method.
   13.3.4. The office responsible for providing Air Force Instructions for metric collection and
   analysis is AFMSA/SG3SA. This responsibility includes identifying key metrics to be
   collected and setting appropriate metric goals. AFMSA/SG3SA will distribute metric
   analyses to appropriate MAJCOMs and MTFs.
   13.3.5. The communication squadron at each MTF is responsible for the maintenance and
   sustainment of the ACD system. The GPM will maintain close coordination with the
   communications squadron to ensure that the ACD system provides continual telephonic
   access to care.
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                              51


13.4. ACD System Key Metrics and Standards.
   13.4.1. TOTAL NUMBER OF CALLS: The total number of calls is the total calls received
   by the ACD – no goal required.
   13.4.2. NUMBER OF CALLS ANSWERED: Number of calls answered is the number of
   calls answered by call center agents – no goal required.
   13.4.3. NUMBER OF CALLS ABANDONED: Number of calls abandoned is the number of
   calls in which a caller hangs up before receiving an answer from an agent – no goal required.
   13.4.4. PERCENTAGE OF CALLS ABANDONED: Number of abandoned calls divided by
   total number of calls – goal is less than or equal to eighteen percent (18%).
   13.4.5. SERVICE LEVEL: Percent of calls answered in 90 seconds – goal is greater than or
   equal to ninety percent (90%).
   13.4.6. AVERAGE ABANDONED TIME: Average abandoned time is the average time a
   caller remains on hold for an agent before hanging up – no goal is required.
   13.4.7. AVERAGE SPEED OF ANSWER: The average speed of answer is the average
   amount of time a caller waits in queue before connecting to an agent – goal is less than or
   equal to forty-five (45) seconds.
   13.4.8. AVERAGE CALL TALK TIME: The average call talk time is the average time an
   agent spends answering an ACD call – less than five (5) minutes.
   13.4.9. AVERAGE AFTER CALL WORK TIME: Average after call work is the average of
   the total time the agent spends working in after call work activities – no goal required but
   minimum time should be set at fifteen (15) seconds.
   13.4.10. AVERAGE HANDLE TIME: Average handle time is the sum of average call talk
   time and average after call work time – no goal is required.
   13.4.11. UTILIZATION: Utilization is the percentage of time an agent is either waiting for a
   call or handling a call versus the total time an agent is logged into the system. The formula is
   the sum of total time an agent is available plus handle time divided by the total time an agent
   is logged into the system. Handle time is the time an agent is either on a call talking or
   occupied in after call work – goal is greater than or equal to seventy percent (70%).
13.5. ACD Call Tree Configuration and Standards.
   13.5.1. Call trees will not exceed 5 options in any given menu. Not included in the five
   options are: 8 – return one menu and 9 – repeat a menu.
   13.5.2. Call menus will not exceed 6 layers.
   13.5.3. Option #1 from the opening or main menu will be appointments. Appointment
   requests should not be directed to voice mail. Clinics should strive to take calls live to
   minimize patient call back. To maximize available phone ports, limit no-essential
   information in the opening or main menu message.
   13.5.4. Appointment calls will be routed to agents trained for first call resolution.
   13.5.5. Each system will ensure any on-hold music represents a professional atmosphere and
   is legally obtained for rebroadcast.

  13.5.6. Public Service Announcements (PSA’s) and all menus should be reviewed and
  verified for relevance quarterly.
  13.5.7. Sites will ensure following each system change the sit-specific documentations, i.e.
  scripts and Call Tree diagram, is updated.
  13.5.8. To ensure consistent data collection across the AFMS, skill set naming conventions
  will start with the MEPRS code.
  13.5.9. All MTF primary Care Manager (PCM) booked appointment will be routed through
  the ACD to capture workload. While the use of skill sets is encouraged for high volume
  clinics the calls may be routed by the ACD to a direct clinic line.
  13.5.10. Include an option off the main menu for information such as clinic hours, healthy
  living and clinic services.
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                              53


                                          Chapter 14

                                  REFERRALS/CONSULTS

14.1. Management of Referrals/Consults. All specialty care and Right of First Refusal
(ROFR) referrals/consults will be managed IAW current Air Force and Assistant Secretary of
Defense (ASD) for Health Affairs (HA) referral management (RM) guidance. Contact your local
Managed Care Support Contractor (MCSC) and TRICARE Regional Office (TRO) for guidance
on the MCSC requirements. Additional RM resources can be found on the AFMS Kx under
Health Benefits.
   14.1.1. (Added-59MDW) All DoD eligible patients seeking specialty care (other than
   specialties which allow self referral) will have a referral from their PCM except in the case of
   a medical emergency.
   14.1.2. (Added-59MDW) All non-emergent referral requests from providers will be entered
   into CHCS or AHLTA.
   14.1.3. (Added-59MDW) For referrals that originate within the MTF, Central Appointment
   Management Office (CAMO)/clinics will attempt to schedule the appropriate care in the
   MTF first. If unavailable, clinics will schedule the care with other MTFs in the direct care
   system. The 59 MDOG/CC or designee will be the approval authority for all consult requests
   for DoD eligible patients’ health care in facilities where the 59 MDW has an agreement (non-
   currency external resource sharing agreement, training affiliation, memorandum of
   agreement/understanding, etc.). This approval will occur prior to authorization by the
   Managed Care Support Contractor (MCSC) and scheduling of procedures at the civilian
   institution.
      14.1.3.1. (Added-59MDW) For referrals that are deferred by the MTF, CAMO will
      send the consult request to all other MTFs in the local area that provide the same service.
      If nothing is available CAMO will then send the consult request to the network.
14.2. Review and Booking of Referrals/Consults.
   14.2.1. All specialty care referrals will be routed to the RMC or the multiservice market
   referral center for review and appointing to the MTF and where feasible to other MTFs.
   MTF specialty clinics will transfer referral review and appointment scheduling duties to the
   RMC or the multiservice market referral center to the maximum extent possible. Exceptions
   to this requirement necessitate MTF command level approval and should be limited to highly
   complex subspecialty clinics and clinics which manage highly sensitive patient data.
   14.2.2. Specialty clinics will provide to the RMC or multiservice market referral center
   standardized and current Specialty Clinic Booking Guidance for each of their providers. The
   Specialty Clinic Booking Guidance should be as unrestrictive as possible to retain/recapture
   the maximum number of specialty care referrals to sustain clinical currency and minimize
   purchased care costs. These reports will display at a minimum: hours of operation,
   population served (e.g. Active Duty (AD) only, Prime, TRICARE Plus (T-Plus)), specialty
   capability, any limitations, and other comments/information pertinent to specialty care
   referrals review and appointing.
54                                                AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


  14.2.3. Specialty Clinic Booking Guidance must be meticulously maintained by the specialty
  clinics with all changes communicated to the RMC per established MTF guidance. This
  guidance will be used by RMC or multiservice market referral center personnel to review and
  book patients within clinic capability and capacity for their initial MTF specialty care referral
  appointments. Initial specialty care referral appointments should be booked prior to the
  patient’s departure from the MTF on the same day the referral was written by the referring
  provider. If the RMC is unable to appoint the patient before leaving the MTF, the MTF shall
  establish written processes for how the MTF/RMC will notify patients of their scheduled
  specialty care appointments. At a minimum, all patients with a referral should be highly
  encouraged to stop by the RMC prior to leaving the MTF to receive referral
  counseling/education and to confirm their contact information on the referral. For
  multiservice market areas where it is not feasible for patients to receive their specialty care
  referral appointments prior to leaving the MTF, processes will be in place to ensure
  expeditious review and appointing.
  14.2.4. In order to route referrals to the RMC, MTFs will configure the RMC as a “CLINIC”
  location type in the Hospital Location file of CHCS. Set the MEPRS at ELAA and populate
  ‘CLINIC SPECIALTY’ with all referral and clinic specialties available to your MTF and
  purchased care, including urgent family/primary care pop-offs.
  14.2.5. In order to correctly defer referrals to the purchased care, MTFs will configure a
  “NETWORK PLACE” hospital location as an “MCP NON-MTF”. Set the MEPRS at FCAA
  and populate ‘CLINIC SPECIALTY’ with all referral and clinic specialties available to your
  MTF and purchased care, including urgent family/primary care pop-offs. The clinic
  specialties for the ‘RMC’ and ‘Network Place’ locations will be the same.
  14.2.6. MTFs will configure each ancillary procedure with the name of the specialty in the
  Clinic Specialty field and the RMC in the Consulting Clinic field. Although it is an optional
  field in CHCS, the Clinic Specialty field will be completed to ensure that the referral is
  directed to the right specialist. This will allow the consult to concurrently route to the Clinic
  Specialty and the RMC review queues. By adding the Clinic Specialty will also allow the
  RMC user to book the consult directly to that clinic without having to add the clinic specialty
  when reviewing the consult. If the RMC clinic is not accepted in the ‘Consulting Clinic’
  queue, ensure that the clinic specialty has been added to the RMC hospital location. If
  automatic printing of the consult is desired, enter the printer device name. If printing is not
  desired, leave the device name blank.
  14.2.7. To review consult requests in the CHCS RMC ‘queue’, use the AHCF menu, choose
  RMC as the clinic and select the date range. Consults will display on this screen. When
  consults are initially reviewed, the Clinic field will display as ‘REFERRAL
  MANAGEMENT CENTER’. If you wish to direct this consult to an MTF specialty clinic,
  including clinics at other MTFS on your CHCS host, change the ‘Clinic” from ‘REFERRAL
  MANAGEMENT CENTER’ to the clinic you wish to forward it to and set the New Review
  Status to the desired status, e.g., Appoint to MTF, Refer to Subspecialty, etc. This puts the
  referral in the destination clinic’s queue at the consulting MTF for review.
  14.2.8. Referrals to MTF specialty clinics must be booked in CHCS using the Appointment
  Order Processing (AOP) function in order to link the appointment with the referral. The
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                           55


  AOP booking option will automatically display in CHCS for any patient who has a referral.
  All appointing agents will check for referrals before walking-in a patient for specialty care.
  14.2.9. Specialty clinics will maintain an adequate number of appointments to meet demand
  within access to care (ATC) standards. If the patient cannot be booked within ATC standards
  and the patient does not waive the ATC standard, the patient will be referred to the purchased
  care system IAW current TRICARE and MCSC requirements.
  14.2.10. If there is neither capability nor capacity within the MTF, referral requests will be
  deferred to the MCSC for Prime and AD beneficiaries. These referrals should be transmitted
  to the MCSC in a HIPAA compliant method within one business day from the date of the
  referral for routine referrals. Since the MCSCs do not process referral requests for Prime
  with Other Health Insurance, TRICARE-Plus, TRICARE for Life, and Standard
  beneficiaries, MTFs will have written processes in place to assist these beneficiaries with
  their referral requirements to the purchased care system providers.
  14.2.11. Documenting the reason for deferring the referral to the purchased care is highly
  encouraged. When entering the final CHCS review status, the RMC will use the below
  deferral codes in the Review Comment field using the [XX] format. For example, if the final
  CHCS review status is “Deferred to Network” and the deferred reason is Capability, then
  “[CB]” must be entered in the final Review Comment field.
     2nd - 2nd Opinion
     CB - Capability
     CC - Continuity
     CP - Capacity
     CMD - Command Directed
     DS - Distance
     POS – Point-of-Service or Self-Directed
     NAR - No Pre-Auth Required
     WTU - Warrior Transition Unit
     RECAP - Recapture back to the MTF and not send to the network
     ROFR - Right of First Refusal
     AV - Air Evacuation
  14.2.12. MTFs located in multiservice markets on a common CHCS host are encouraged to
  negotiate with other MTFs to have access to specialty care appointment schedules and
  receive current Specialty Clinic Booking Guidance pertinent to the specialty care available at
  those MTFs. This will allow timely review and booking of initial specialty care referral and
  ROFR appointments within capability and capacity. In turn, this will allow timely
  transmission of defer to network referrals to the MCSC when capability and capacity is not
  available in the multiservice market as describe above.
  14.2.13. If the referring MTF is not allowed to book into the consulting MTF on the same
  CHCS host, then the referral will be given the status of “Refer to Subspecialty” (code 14) and
  in the first characters of the first line of the Review Comment field will add “To MTF/” plus
  the DMIS of the consulting MTF, e.g. TO MTF/0066. Complete the Clinic Specialty field to
  indicate the specialist/care requested.
 56                                               AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


   14.2.14. If the referring MTF is not on the same CHCS host as the consulting MTF, the
   referral will be given the status of “Defer to Network” (code #10) and in the first characters
   of the first line of the Review Comment field will add “To MTF/” plus the DMIS of the
   consulting MTF, e.g. TO MTF/0066. Complete the Clinic Specialty field to indicate the
   specialist/care requested.
   14.2.15. If accepting referrals from another MTF not on the same CHCS host, the consulting
   MTF shall enter the referral in CHCS/AHLTA as a consult and type “From MTF” with the
   DMIS of the referring MTF in the first characters of the first line of the ‘Reason for
   Referral’ field, e.g., FROM MTF/0066.
14.3. Referral Conditions and Decision Points.
   14.3.1. MTF providers will complete their patient encounter documentation in AHLTA
   within 72 hours of the encounter.
   14.3.2. CHCS consult tracking tracks only the initial appointment of a referral. When the
   referral has a kept appointment associated with it, CHCS considers the referral closed.
   Therefore, MTF will not manually close the referral with a “NO APPOINTMENT
   REQUIRED” review status.
   14.3.3. MTFs will use the BOOKED TO REMOTE status if they know that the patient has
   or kept their purchased care appointment. This status does not close the consult and does not
   indicate results were received.
   14.3.4. Once the initial referral result is received from the purchased care provider, the RMC
   will close the referral in CHCS using the CHCS status of “Deferred results received” (code
   #23). If the purchased care provider does not provide a result for a confirmed patient visit
   and the RMC has attempted to obtain results from the provider, then the RMC will close the
   referral in CHCS using the CHCS status of “Deferred results received” and in the very first
   spaces of the Review Comment field enter “NRR” for ”No results received.” After “NRR”,
   the MTF may add additional comments as needed/desired.
   14.3.5. If an appointment is not made, the RMC or multiservice market area referral center
   will attempt to contact the patient via phone, automated reminder system, and/or by mail no
   later than 20 days after referral generation. On the referral, document in CHCS each attempt
   to contact the patient and the result of the attempt (e.g., left message, wrong number, patient
   refused, etc). If the patient has not made their MTF or purchased care initial specialty care
   referral appointment within 120 days of the referral order date or if the patient refuses the
   appointment, the RMC will close the referral in CHCS with the CHCS status of “No
   appointment required” (code #13) and in the very first spaces of the Review Comment field,
   type “NU” for “Not Utilized”. After “NU,” the MTFs can add additional comments as
   needed/desired such as patient refused, patient cancelled, patient did not activate, and/or
   patient no showed, etc. The referring provider shall be notified of all referrals not used by
   their patients. The patient will be required to get a new referral if clinically indicated.
   14.3.6. If the deferred to network referral is denied by the MCSC, then the RMC shall close
   the referral in CHCS with the CHCS status of “No appointment required” and in the very
   first spaces of the Review Comment field, type “MCSC denied.”
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                            57


14.4. Air Force MTFs on lone CHCS hosts will override the Administrative Closure
function in CHCS (Task is CP Auto Referral Closure). This will inactivate all 30-, 45-, and
90-day administrative referral closures and ensure that specialty care consults remain open until
they are intentionally closed by the MTF. Waivers for this requirement will be addressed to
AFMSA/SG3SA on an individual basis.
14.5. ROFR Determinations and Management.
   14.5.1. The RMC or multiservice market referral center will determine if the MTF has
   specialty capability and capacity to accept ROFRs within ATC standards. [Note: If there is
   no appointment within the ATC standard, the patient may waive their ATC standard to be
   seen by the MTF.] ROFR determinations must be made and the MCSC notified per
   TRICARE Operations Manual, Chapter 8, Section 5. If the MTF does not take action on the
   ROFR, it will be considered to be an implied denial of the ROFR and the MCSC will appoint
   to the purchased care system.
       14.5.1.1. (Added-59MDW) Within Prime Service Areas, MTFs have the Right of First
       Refusal (ROFR) for all referrals. Clinics will determine which referral requests to accept
       based upon capability and capacity.
   14.5.2. If the ROFR is accepted, the RMC will enter the ROFR into CHCS/AHLTA as a
   consult and type “ROFR” in the first spaces of the Reason for Referral field or in the Review
   Comment field. If the ROFR is entered in Referral Booking, the RMC will convert the
   referral to a consult in CHCS in order to track results. Use a downtown provider or generic
   downtown provider as the referring provider. Include “ROFR” or “Right of First Refusal” in
   the first line of the Reason for Referral or Review Comment field on the ROFR record.
   14.5.3. ROFR Results. The RMC will provide referral results to the referring purchased care
   providers on ROFR care rendered by the MTF. The RMC will send the referral results in a
   HIPAA-compliant method directly to the purchased care provider within 10 working days of
   the initial patient encounter.
       14.5.3.1. (Added-59MDW) Clinics will accept or decline ROFRs and respond to the
       MCSC within one business day for routine ROFRs and within 30 minutes for 72-hour
       ROFRs. When no response is received from the MTF in response to the ROFR request
       within one business day (30 minutes for 72-hour ROFRs), the MCSC will process the
       referral request as if the MTF declined to see the patient.
14.6. Additional Referral Visits or Specialty Care Authorization. Per TOM, Chapter 8,
Section 5, for services beyond the initial authorization, the MCSC shall use its best business
practices in determining the extent of additional services to authorize. The MCSC shall not
request a referral from the MTF but shall provide the MTF, through the MTF’s single POC [the
RMC], a copy of the authorization and clinical information that served as the basis for the new
authorization. Requests from network providers for AD patients to obtain additional referral care
or visits will be returned directly to the MTF for consideration and action.
14.7. Active Duty Service Member (ADSM) Referral Management. The MCSCs will
authorize and find a provider for ADSM referrals to the network. On a case-by-case basis (e.g.
Personnel Reliability Program (PRP), deployers, and those undergoing Medical Evaluation
Boards), will be screen/treated IAW AFMAN 10-3902, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability
Program (PRP) and DoD 5210.42-R, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program (PRP).
 58                                                  AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012


   14.7.1. ADSMs referred to the network may require prompt action with regard to referral
   processing to meet mission requirements. HA policy requires medical commanders ensure
   that specialty care services are uniformly available for ADSMs on “medical hold” within two
   weeks of identifying the need for an appointment.
   14.7.2. MTFs should collaborate with their MCSC to ensure that ADSMs receive their
   referral authorizations and appointments expeditiously. Referring MTF providers need to
   specify in the body of the referral when the ADSM should be seen (e.g., 72 hours, 7 days, 14
   days, etc.) rather than using the default 28-day ATC standard for “Routine” priority referrals.
   MTF leadership will ensure policies are in place, and fully address the management of
   ADSM referrals.
14.8. Management of Urgent and Routine Primary Care Referred to the Network.
   14.8.1. Prior to sending acute or routine primary care services to the purchased care system,
   MTF leadership will develop written instructions governing when and how such services will
   be used. MTF leadership will work closely with their TRICARE Regional Office and nearby
   multi-market MTFs (if applicable) to ensure the most effective and efficient utilization of
   MTF resources.
   14.8.2. MTFs should coordinate with the MCSC to identify specific urgent and routine
   primary care clinics in the purchased care system.
   14.8.3. MTFs will develop processes to ensure a referral is generated for all patients sent to
   the purchased care system for urgent and routine primary care. The referral shall be entered
   in CHCS/AHLTA by the PCM or designee. If the referral is entered in Referral Booking,
   convert the referral to a consult in CHCS in order to track results. The Clinic Specialty field
   must be one of the following to ensure tracking as a primary care referral: Family
   Practice/Primary Care, Flight Medicine, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, or Urgent Care. If a
   non-privileged MTF staff member enters the referral, then the referral must be signed by the
   PCM/designated credentialed provider. After duty hours, the PCM/credentialed provider
   may use the current remote CHCS/AHLTA access information system or enter the referral
   into CHCS/AHLTA on the next duty day.
   14.8.4. Track all referrals for urgent and routine primary care until the results are obtained
   and added to the medical record.
14.9. Referral Management Accountability and Tracking.
   14.9.1. The RMC is responsible for tracking and accounting for all initial specialty care
   referrals and urgent/routine primary care referrals and their results. For MTFs where the
   MTF command leadership has determined that the review and booking authority may remain
   in the clinics, the clinics will be responsible for accounting, tracking and resulting on all of
   their initial specialty care referrals. All initial specialty care referral results received via hard
   copy (i.e. mail, fax) will be forwarded to the RMC. These results will be closed out in CHCS
   per 14.3 above and forwarded to the referring provider for review and signature. Ensure
   follow-up visit results are provided to the referring provider for review. The referring
   provider is responsible for the review of the referral result/report and the documentation of
   the review in the patient’s record. The MTF shall have a process in place ensuring the signed
   hard copy results are forwarded to outpatient records for filing in the patient’s medical
   record. For CHCS/AHLTA generated referral results, the MTF will establish written
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                             59


   processes to monitor referring provider review of CHCS/AHLTA results and notify the
   SGH/designee of deficiencies.
   14.9.2. For purchased care referral results, MTFs will have written processes in place for
   actively reconciling missing results to conclusion on all initial specialty care referrals and
   urgent/primary care deferred to the network. As part of the reconciliation process, RMCs
   should review MCSC Web-based Tools, filed claims, and conduct in-house retrieval (e.g.
   clinics, mail room) before contacting the network specialty provider to request the results. In
   order to communicate referral results status to referring providers in absence of known
   network appointments, MTF RMCs will provide providers with a list of referrals not used or
   activated by patients. This allows the referring provider to make clinical determinations on
   the patient’s status.
14.10. RM Performance Measurement and Reporting.
   14.10.1. RM Data Tracking. MTFs will implement established minimum performance
   measurement metrics that report key indicators and outcomes of referral management
   functions and ensure use of the AFMS Referral Management System Tracking Reports tool.
   14.10.2. Reporting of Referral Management Performance Measurement Metrics. Referral
   Management performance metrics will be reported to MTF leadership on a regularly
   recurring basis but no less than quarterly. In addition, the AFMS RM Program Manager will
   provide the consolidated metrics to AF/SG for review semiannually and as requested.

16.1. MTF leadership will develop guidelines and procedures to ensure after hours care is
provided IAW with ASD (HA) 11-005, TRICARE Policy for Access to Care and Prime
Service Area Standards. The policy states, "After normal duty hours, an "on call" PCM should
be available to triage Prime beneficiaries, either directly, or to provide back-up consultation to an
advice nurse." Patients will be educated on these policies and subsequent local supporting
procedures.

HEALTH CARE ACCESS FOR TRICARE PRIME BENEFICIARIES NOT ENROLLED
              TO THE MTF OR IN A TRANSITION STATUS

17.1. Establish Guidelines. MTF leadership will establish guidelines to ensure appointment
access to TRICARE Prime enrolled members who may be in a student status, travel status,
transitioning enrollment between MTFs, transferring enrollment between regional support
contractors, or in a terminal/appellate leave status.
17.2. Coordination with Other DoD MTFs. Leaders of MTFs located in multi-market areas
will develop guidelines to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are delineated in delivering
care to TRICARE Prime beneficiaries enrolled to other multi-market MTFs in their area. The
goal is to maximize care provided by the PCM to which they are enrolled.
17.3. Same Level Enrollee Access. In accordance with HA TRICARE Policy for Access to
Care and Prime Service Area Standards, all TRICARE Prime enrollees will be given the same
level of access to appointments within the MTF regardless of their Prime enrollment location.
17.4. Enrolled Elsewhere Access. If the MTF cannot provide care for these enrolled elsewhere
beneficiaries within its direct care system, either because these beneficiaries cannot contact their
own PCM for consultation or to gain care from the MTF to which they are enrolled, the MTF
will ensure that a referral is entered authorizing care to be provided by network/contract
resources for these beneficiaries.
17.5. Transfer of Enrollment. MTFs will establish guidelines informing patients of their need
to seek or transfer their enrollment to an MTF in the area within 30 days if they intend to remain
in its Prime Service Area (PSA) past this 30 day time frame. TRICARE Flight personnel shall
ensure Active Duty Service Members (ADSMs) departing their final duty stations are briefed
about how they should access health care services while in terminal or appellate leave status.
17.6. Access to Care (ATC) and Enrollment Procedures for Transitioning
Beneficiaries. TRICARE personnel should proactively provide options and instructions on
enrollment procedures and accessing care to TRICARE Prime beneficiaries identified to be in
transition status due to out-processing, changing enrollment sites, or spending greater than 30
days away from the MTF where the beneficiaries are enrolled. These may be beneficiaries
geographically separated from their sponsors, to include spouses and children of deployed Active
Duty, fulltime college students attending school away from their enrolled MTF, and retirees on
extended vacations.

                      RESERVE COMPONENT ACCESS TO CARE

19.1. Introduction. Reserve Component (RC) access to care is a medical readiness and Total
Force concern which is essential to the successful execution of the Air Force Mission. RC
members may perform duty under a variety of official statuses which makes determining their
eligibility for care and medical services complex. Eligible RC members on Active Duty (AD) or
inactive duty status have the same priority as AD members to include requirements for
Preventive Health Assessments (PHAs). It is the responsibility of MTF staff to understand RC
eligibility for care in order to provide the appropriate medical entitlements. The following DOD
and Air Force publications provide guidance for determining RC eligibility: DoDI 1241.01,
Reserve Component Medical Care and Incapacitation Pay for Line of Duty Conditions, DoDI
1241.2, Reserve Component Incapacitation System Management, AFI 44-115, Authorized Health
Care and Health Care Benefits in the Military Health System (MHS), AFI 36-2910, Line of Duty
(Misconduct) Determination, AFI 44-170 Preventive Health Assessment, AFH 41-114, Military
Health Services System (MHSS) Matrix, DoDD 1332.18 Separation for Retirement for Physical
Disability, AFRC PHA Guide, USAF Preventive Health Assessment Guide, and DoDI 1332.38
Physical Disability Evaluation. In…. In addition Title 10 USC Section 1074 and Title 37
Section 204 (g)(h) as well as AFRC/SG and ANG/SG can be used for references.
   19.1.1. RC members who incur or aggravate an injury or illness in the line of duty while
   performing active duty, active duty for training or inactive duty for training or while
   traveling directly to or from such duty shall be provided the medical or dental care
   appropriate for the condition until the member is found fit for military duty, or the injury,
   illness or disease cannot be materially improved by further hospitalization or treatment and
   the member has been separated or returned as a result of a Disability Evaluation System
   determination.
19.2. RC Health Care Benefits when on military orders for 30 days or less.
   19.2.1. RC members will have the same level of access to care as active duty members
   during the period of duty.
   19.2.2. RC Access to MTF or TRICARE medical care should be granted to those members
   whose conditions occur while on duty or may be related to a direct injury or illness occurring
   during the current period of duty, or to an injury/illness or condition aggravated during the
   current period of duty.
   19.2.3. The MTF medical professional treating the member is required to make an initial
   evaluation documenting the details of the injury/illness. MTF staff must initiate a Line of
   Duty for all injuries/illnesses that may require significant follow up or could result in future
   fitness for duty determinations after the duty period ends. This LOD will link the
   injury/illness to a service connection and therefore ensure member receives future
   treatment/care.
   19.2.4. Referral care for TRICARE appointments outside the MTF will only be paid for if
   the LOD process is initiated, completed, and coordinated with the Military Medical Support
   Office (MMSO) by MTF staff. Coordination with the MMSO will ensure services are
   rendered without a denial of claim.
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                                 65


   19.2.5. Access to care terminates when the period of duty ends.
19.3. RC Health Care Benefits for Air Force required evaluation.
19.3.1. RC member PHA requirements will be IAW current AF PHA and IMR
instructions and guidance. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) will follow the same rules as
AD members. RC members may be seen by any MTF privileged provider. RC members on
flying status must be seen by an MTF flight surgeon.
   19.3.2. RC members assigned to RC Units will receive their required evaluations (e.g.,
   Periodic Health Assessment, annual Dental exam) from their respective servicing RC
   Medical Unit or other approved source.
19.3.3. Reserve Component members attached to Active Duty units (e.g., IMAs) or assigned to
RC Units without a servicing RC Medical Unit will receive their required evaluations from an
Active Duty MTF or other approved source.
   19.3.3.1. Many RC members travel considerable distances from their home to their unit of
   assignment or have limited time to complete these appointments on duty days.
   Clinic/ancillary services personnel must complete all physical and ancillary services in one
   (1) day (this does not include the completion of the paperwork, only the actual testing and
   evaluation).
   19.3.3.2. RC members residing outside the MTF catchment area or more than 40 miles from
   their units servicing MTF may also obtain these evaluations from any MTF close to their
   residence.
   19.3.3.3. RC members are not required to be in military status to schedule an appointment,
   however, they must be in military status at the time of the examination. This status can be in
   the form of official orders (active) or inactive/points only (Inactive Duty for Training - IDT)
   documented on an AF Form 40A. In many cases, DEERS will not indicate the correct
   eligibility status for these members to obtain the required evaluations. It is the responsibility
   of active duty MTFs to ensure that staff and appointment personnel are aware of this
   distinction.
   19.3.3.4. RC members will have the same level of access for these required evaluations as
   active duty members.
   19.3.3.5. Accountability of IMA medical/dental records and the timely update of the
   appropriate medical tracking systems (e.g., PIMR, DDS) is an active duty MTF
   responsibility. Ensure RC members receive a copy of all medical paperwork from the
   evaluation to be included in their medical record at the appropriate MTF where it is filed.
19.4. RC access to care for emergent conditions.
19.4.1. Any RC member presenting themselves for emergency treatment at an MTF after
termination of military duty stating that the emergent condition is related to an injury, illness, or
disease incurred or aggravated as a result of a period of duty, shall be examined and provided
necessary medical care.
19.4.2. MTF staff must initiate a Line of Duty for each condition.
19.5. RC access to care for Line of Duty Determinations.

19.5.1. RC members will have the same level of access to care as active duty members for
treatment of those conditions identified In the Line of Duty (ILOD) or ILOD/SA (Service
Aggravated). Access to care is allowed during the determination of the LOD. The RC member
must provide documentation of LOD(s) that are in process or have been determined ILOD in
order to receive follow-up care (e.g., AF Form 348).
19.5.2. RC members are not eligible for care when the determination is not in the Line of
Duty. Care received at this point will be at the member’s expense.
19.6. Reserve Component Referrals. RC members, who require follow-up care not in the area
where the initial treatment was rendered, are referred to the closest MTF near their home.
Appropriate medical authority from the referring MTF contacts the appropriate medical authority
at the receiving MTF to ensure care is delivered. The referring MTF notifies the member’s
supporting RC medical squadron (HQ AFRC/RMG SG) of the referral action for tracking
purposes.
19.6.1. Reserve Component members who are serving under Title 10, Contingency orders who
are identified with potential duty-related illness or injury should be referred in an urgent manner
(72 hour consult), to include maximal utilization of both Active Duty and off-base referral sites.
This practice will ensure timely identification and access to entitled healthcare prior to the end of
mobilization or contingency orders and without a break in service that can result in loss of
medical benefits.

requests for emergent care will be provided on an immediate basis as dictated by the threat.
   20.2.1. (Added-59MDW) Initial requests for Emergent mental health care will be provided
   on an immediate basis as dictated by the treatment protocol and level of threat.
20.3. Urgent Mental Health Care. Urgent mental health care will be provided within 24 hours
or less and clinics can book these patients into ACUT appointments or walk them in.
   20.3.1. (Added-59MDW) Urgent mental health care will be provided within 24 hours or
   less and can be booked as an ACUT appointment.
20.4. Routine Mental Health Care. Routine Mental Health Care is defined as an initial request
for a new mental health condition or exacerbation of a previously diagnosed condition for which
intervention is required but is not urgent.
   20.4.1. Routine mental health care will be provided within one week/7 calendar days of the
   patient’s request. Beneficiaries will retain the option of deferring this routine mental health
   assessment past this 7 day standard.
       20.4.1.1. (Added-59MDW) Routine mental health care is defined as an initial request
       for a new mental health condition or exacerbation of a previously diagnosed mental
       health assessment. This activity can be booked as an ROUT appointment type with a
       seven day access standard.
   20.4.2. Appointing staffs will be aware that these routine mental health care requests need to
   be appointed within 7 days and may be appointed to the patient’s PCM, Behavioral Health
   Clinics (BHOP), or Mental Health Clinic.
   20.4.3. Mental Health Clinics will use the ROUT or ROUT$ appointment type in their
   templates and schedules and use the Routine ATC Category to book these initial mental
   health self-referral requests. Mental Health Clinics will not book these type requests into
   SPEC appointment slots.
   20.4.4. (Added-59MDW) Patients self-refer by telephone or by walking in. Patients who
   walk-in are evaluated prior to leaving. When the contact is made by phone, patients are
   asked a few key questions.
       20.4.4.1. (Added-59MDW) Are they Active Duty?
       20.4.4.2. (Added-59MDW) Have they been seen here before?

       Evaluation. Patients with SI/HI and/or acute needs are asked to walk-in to the clinic or
       seek other appropriate emergency services.
20.5. Mental Health Clinic Appointment Types. Appointment types will be used IAW
paragraph 3.2 of this AFI. In addition, Mental Health Clinics when setting up their templates
and schedules are only permitted to use five standard appointment types with or without $
suffixes per the following guidance:
   20.5.1. ACUT or ACUT$ slots will be used to book urgent mental health care requests
   within 24 hours.
   20.5.2. ROUT and ROUT$ slots will be used to book initial requests for a new mental health
   condition or exacerbation of a previously diagnosed condition for which intervention is
   required but is not urgent within 7 days, or when a patient self-refers.
   20.5.3. SPEC and SPEC$ slots will be used to book any Routine priority referral/consult
   requests for initial mental health care evaluations within the time frame requested by the
   referring provider or not to exceed 28 days. SPEC will not be used when a patient self-
   refers.
   20.5.4. EST and EST$ slots will be used to book appointments when providers direct the
   patient to come back (follow-up) for additional mental health care/course of therapy. These
   appointments will be booked within the time frame requested by the mental health provider.
   20.5.5. GRP and GRP$ slots will be used for patients who require group therapies,
   counseling, or teaching sessions where a mental health provider will perform the service in a
   group setting. The detail code fields can be used to provide further information about the
   care to be provided in the group appointment, (e.g., STRESS for a Stress Management
   Class). A group appointment should be scheduled per self referral of the patient, the clinic's
   or referring provider's policy or designation.
20.6. Referral Care Guidance for Mental Health. Specialty care mental health referrals will
be managed IAW with AFI 44-172, Mental Health Operations.
20.7. Network Care Authorizations for ADSM and Family Members. ADSMs require
preauthorization prior to obtaining non-emergent mental healthcare outside the direct care
system. All other Prime beneficiaries may still use their unmanaged eight mental health visits in
the TRICARE network before obtaining preauthorization.

        MANAGEMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC AND ANCILLARY CARE ACCESS

21.1. ATC Standards and Referral/Consult Priorities. AFMS Radiology, Laboratory and
Pharmacy (Ancillary) departments/services will provide diagnostic services, procedures, or tests
per the ATC time standard assigned as stated by referral/consult priority or the specific
timeframe requested by the provider.
21.2. Guidance if Referral Not Entered. If a consult/referral is not requested by the provider
for radiology, laboratory care, (input thru order entry in CHCS/AHLTA) or if this care is for
other than a well-patient service, there is no specific ATC standard that needs to be followed.
Additionally, there are no ATC standards applied in the Radiology, Laboratory or Pharmacy
scheduling functions of CHCS therefore there are no ATC standards that can be tracked. The
ATC standard to be applied in these circumstances will be based on the attending provider’s
medical judgment.
21.3. Guidance on Mammography Screenings. Mammography screenings will be provided
IAW the guidance and timeframes established in AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management, and
current ASD (HA) 99-009, Mammography Screening for Active Duty Women.

            MANAGEMENT OF PHYSICAL THERAPY (PT) CARE ACCESS

22.1. Management of PT Care and Referrals. IAW with AFI 44-119, Medical Quality
Operations, PT clinics may provide direct access (i.e., no referral needed) neuromusculoskeletal
evaluation, for acute, subacute and chronic musculoskeletal and neuromuscular conditions. This
includes the ordering appropriate radiographs and laboratory tests, initiating temporary profiles
up to 90 days, admitting or discharging to and from quarters, referring to other specialists
appropriate to the patient’s needs, and prescribing medications such as nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatories, non-narcotic analgesics and designated muscle relaxants (i.e. flexoril) from the
MTF formulary. Specialty care physical therapy referrals will be managed IAW current AFMS
and MHS referral management policies and guidance.
22.2. Guidance on Sending PT Care to the Network. MTF physical therapy clinics will
develop processes and work closely with MTF RMC so that use of MTF or other local direct
care MTFs’ PT resources is maximized. Referral of PT care to the network or civilian providers
should only be used if MTF capabilities are exceeded or MTF care cannot be provided within the
applicable ATC standards of the provider’s referral request.
22.3. Appointment Types Used in PT Templates and Schedules. Appointment types will be
used IAW paragraph 3.2 of this AFI. Local PT clinic leadership will determine the number and
mix of appointments and their types to support their local population’s demand. PT clinics are
only permitted to use   FIVE standard appointment types with or without $ suffixes per the
guidance stated below when setting up their templates and schedules.
   22.3.1. ACUT and ACUT$ slots will only be used to schedule direct access (i.e., no referral
   needed) neuromusculoskeletal evaluations, for acute musculoskeletal and neuromuscular
   conditions that should be seen within 24 hours. The Acute ATC Category will be used to
   search for and book these ACUT($) appointments.
       22.3.1.1. Local PT clinic staff will work closely with MTF appointing support personnel
       to fully educate them in what patient conditions would merit use of the ACUT($)
       appointment slot.
       22.3.1.2. The numbers of ACUT($) slots will be used sparingly as to not open the PT
       clinic that declares itself as a direct access clinic, entirely to an acute or walk-in service.
   22.3.2. SPEC and SPEC$ slots will be used to schedule/book any Routine priority
   referral/consult requests for initial physical therapy care evaluations by a physical therapist,
   (officer or civilian/contract equivalent) within the time frame requested by the referring
   provider or not to exceed 28 days. The Specialty ATC category will be used to book these
   appointments.
   22.3.3. EST and EST$ slots will be used to schedule/book appointments to the physical
   therapist for the purpose of reevaluation or treatment. These appointments will be booked
   within the time frame requested by the physical therapist. The Future CHCS search function
   will be used to search for and book these EST($) appointments.
   22.3.4. PROC and PROC$ slots will be used to schedule physical therapy care appointments
   to enlisted, civilian, or contract physical therapy technicians (PT technicians) or equivalent
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                               71


   providers as approved/directed by the physical therapist. The majority of appointments
   scheduled for PT technicians will use the PROC/PROC$ appointment type. If multiple
   patients are to be seen at the same time by the Physical Therapy Technician in a group setting
   for physical therapy care/courses of therapy to be provided, the PROC/PROC$ appointment
   type with multiple appointment slots during the same time will be used. The Specialty ATC
   Category will be used to search for and book these appointment types. All PROC/PROC$
   appointments will be booked within 28 days to meet the Specialty Care ATC standard.
   22.3.5. GRP and GRP$ slots will be used for patients who require group teaching/education
   classes/sessions by any physical therapist or PT technician. A group appointment should be
   scheduled per self referral of the patient or the clinic's/referring provider's policy or
   designation. The CHCS search function will be used to search for and book these
   appointments.
22.4. PT Appointing Protocols. Local PT clinic leadership will provide MTF appointing
support functions (central or decentralized offices) with updated protocols to ensure that the right
patient is appointed to the right appointment slot, right provider at the right time.
22.5. Guidance if Physical Therapist and PT Tech Treat Patient During Same Visit. If both
the physical therapist and the PT technician see a patient during a visit, the appointment type
used will default to the one that was originally chosen to book the appointment. For example, if
a PROC appointment is booked for the PT tech, but during the visit the physical therapist sees
the patient, then the appointment type for the visit remains PROC($).
22.6. Appointment Types Not Used in PT Clinic Schedules. Physical Therapy Clinics will
not use the ROUT($), WELL($) or PCM($) appointment types on any templates or schedules.
22.7. Provision of Urgent PT Care. Urgent physical therapy care will be provided within 24
hours or less per the referring provider’s request. Provider-to-provider direct communication is
required for urgent PT care requests.

                                           Chapter 23

 MANAGEMENT OF URGENT/ACUTE AND ROUTINE HEALTH CARE SERVICES
 FOR ENROLLED BENEFICIARIES WHEN THE MTF CANNOT PROVIDE THESE
            SERVICES IN HOUSE WITHIN ATC STANDARDS

23.1. Management of Urgent/Routine Primary Care Referrals. There will times that patient
demand for primary care services will exceed the supply that the MTF can provide. When that
event occurs MTF leadership must maintain ATC standards IAW 32 CFR 199.17 for
urgent/acute and routine health services required by enrolled beneficiaries when this in house
MTF supply does not meet this demand and patients must be referred to the network/purchased
care system.
23.2. Written Guidance Required. Prior to sending acute or routine health care services to the
network/purchase care system, MTF leadership will develop written instructions governing when
and how such services will be used. MTF leadership will work closely with their local Managed
Care Support Contractor (MCSC), management and nearby multi service market MTFs (if
applicable) to ensure that the most effective and efficient utilization of MTF Direct Care/in house
resources are used.
23.3. Strategies to Decrease and/or Mitigate the Need to Send Care to the
Network/Purchased Care System. MTF leadership formulate plans and can take actions in the
direct care system and with the Network/Purchased Care System to adequately manage, mitigate
and/or decrease acute/routine primary care services having to be referred out of the MTF.
   23.3.1. Direct Care.
       23.3.1.1. MTF/Clinic enrolled population and MHS/AFMS enrollment guidance should
       be reviewed and adjusted when appropriate to meet ATC Standards and Business
       Planning Targets.
       23.3.1.2. Identify the MTF’s authorized and assigned level of providers and support staff
       in its Primary Care product lines to determine a threshold for need for additional
       appointments and possible need to use purchased care services.
       23.3.1.3. Group Practice Managers (GPMs)/Access Managers should identify the actual
       and unmet demand level of appointments. If demand cannot be met, plans can be made
       to use alternative strategies including use of Non-Enrolled Medical Officers (NEMOs),
       floaters, and nurse/tech/pharmacy run clinics. Use of the purchased care system should
       be a last resort.
       23.3.1.4. GPMs/Access Managers should constantly review the supply of appointments,
       including seasonal variations so that this supply can be anticipated and plans can be made
       accordingly to activate pop off care services.
       23.3.1.5. Establish cross booking guidelines across MTF primary care product lines, e.g.
       If the primary care clinic Team A does not have any available appointments, processes
       should be in place for appointing agents to book to Team B, or to the Pediatrics clinic for
       Team A’s children. Other alternatives could be to use certain specialty clinics for
       overflow in the Primary Care product lines such as ear problems to the ENT clinic or
       ankle sprains to orthopedics or physical therapy clinics.
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                           73


     23.3.1.6. In multi-market areas, investigate the utilization of other Air Force, Army, or
     Navy direct care system services.
     23.3.1.7. Develop processes to anticipate short and long term provider and clinic support
     staff shortages, (i.e. TDY, leave, illness, deployments). Identify opportunities and
     implement a process of backfills, (i.e. scheduling of floaters, non-empanelled medical
     officers/providers, IMAs, etc.)
     23.3.1.8. Communicate with MAJCOM or AFMOA regarding Provider and Support
     Staff PCS timelines to mitigate summer under-lap.
     23.3.1.9. Explore options of civilian or contract hires through civilian personnel,
     resource management, AFMS Commodity Council or MTF/Base Contracting Offices.
     23.3.1.10. Consider Clinical Support/Resource Sharing Agreements with MCSC or
     VA/DoD to help offset deficiencies in supply.
  23.3.2. Purchased Care Guidance:
     23.3.2.1. MTF leadership will develop written instruction governing when and how such
     services will be used. MTF leadership will work closely with their TRICARE Regional
     Office, and nearby multi-service market MTFs (if applicable) to ensure the most effective
     and efficient utilization of MTF resources. These strategies may include but not be
     limited to the following:
     23.3.2.2. Utilize the purchased care system (preferably Network) only when the MTF
     has exhausted all internal opportunities to meet the urgent or routine ATC standards for
     beneficiaries requiring urgent care or routine care within ATC standards for primary care.
     23.3.2.3. Coordinate with the TRICARE Regional Office to identify specific urgent and
     routine primary care clinics in the purchased care system.
     23.3.2.4. Develop processes to ensure that all patients that are sent to the purchased care
     system for urgent and routine care receive a referral. The referral shall be entered in
     CHCS/AHLTA by the Family Health Team (FHT) or PCM/PCM team. After duty hours
     the FHT or PCM/PCM team providers may use remote CHCS/AHLTA access such as
     Enterprise Remote Access (ERA) or other means to enter the referral into CHCS/AHLTA
     on the day or next duty day. MTF leadership will ensure that providers who are on call
     are provided access to ERA for this purpose.
     23.3.2.5. The referral must be transmitted via CHCS/AHLTA to the Referral
     Management Center (RMC) for review and forwarding to the MCSC according to
     established AF/SG RMC instruction and guidance.
     23.3.2.6. TRICARE For Life, TRICARE Plus, TRICARE Standard, and Prime with
     Other Health Insurance beneficiaries are not eligible for MCSC rendered services. The
     Referral Management Center (RMC) will provide these beneficiaries with
     information/assistance to obtain urgent/routine primary care.
     23.3.2.7. Track all referrals for urgent and routine primary care until the results are
     obtained and added to the medical record. The MTF not the MCSC will track urgent and
     routine primary care results and will have processes in place to obtain these results
     directly from the purchased care sector.

     23.3.2.8. Document all patient refusals for urgent and routine care referrals to the
     purchased care sector IAW HIPAA mandates.
     23.3.2.9. MTF leadership must review urgent care and routine primary care referrals to
     the purchased care system on a recurring basis.

   24.2.1. MTFs will have written processes in place with established requirements for the
   provision of initial and annual refresher appointing training programs for all appointing
   agents and/or staff that handle patient appointments on a regular basis. Training will cover
   but not be limited to the following topics:
      24.2.1.1. The goals and objectives of the AFMS and the local MTF Access Improvement
      Program; the mission of the AFMS, the MAJCOM and the Base to which the appointing
      agents are assigned.
      24.2.1.2. The purpose, proper uses, operating instructions and troubleshooting guidance
      on the various templating, scheduling, booking and reporting functions of CHCS that
      appointing agents use to support local clinic, MTF and regional appointing practices.
      These would include using the splitting and joining function; using the unbooked
      appointment reporting function; documenting telephone consults, tips on maintaining
      patient continuity; knowledge on booking walk-ins and follow-ups.
      24.2.1.3. Proper use of patient registration and demographic information updating
      processes.
      24.2.1.4. Knowing the functions, features, proper operations of the MTF appointing
      telephone system, to support optimal call center operations and performance.
      24.2.1.5. Understanding the principles and the execution of good customer service to
      patients, providers, and access team members. Understand the indicators of how good
      customer service is exhibited and maintained, to include access to care measures,
      satisfaction surveys and appointing telephony measure results.
      24.2.1.6. Clear understanding of the individual employee’s position description and
      those on the access team. Training will provide clear knowledge of job goals and
      objectives and how these support improving access at the MTF.
      24.2.1.7. Initial appointing training for all staff is completed and documented by the
      CHCS Training Team prior to that individual being given the CHCS keys to perform
      appointing functions. The 59 MDW Group Practice Managers/Advisors, led by the
      Senior Group Practice Manager (GPM), will provide refresher training to all appointing
      personnel assigned to the 59 MDW. Documentation of the appointment refresher
      training will be documented in the Air Force Training Record System (AFTRS) and/or
      the AF Form 1098 by the appropriate training manager. The training will be approved by
      the Senior GPM and will be conducted annually (calendar year) by the Group Practice
      Managers/Advisors no later than 31 March.
   24.2.2. Evidence of this training will be documented in individual staff training folders.
24.3. Management of Appointing Agents.
   24.3.1. Appointing agents are generally active duty, civil service, or contractors, typically in
   the grade of E-3 or 4 or GS-3 or 4. These personnel can receive approximately 200-300 calls
   per day. Their main duties are to triage and route calls; search for and book appointments;
   perform eligibility verifications; manage reports from CHCS and often manage provider
   schedules/templates.
   24.3.2. Managers of appointing agents will ensure there are position descriptions for all
   appointing agents. Managers will ensure that there are consistent enlisted evaluation
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                              77


   indicators, civilian performance objectives, and contractor performance requirements among
   these three groups, as it is common that they could be working together on the same job site
   or office. Different standards among these personnel may lead to inconsistent support to the
   appointing mission. Managers will ensure that there is regular and consistent performance
   feedback provided to all appointing agents. Appointing agents must understand their
   performance objectives and know that they are being monitored on a continuous basis. This
   monitoring ensures that high standards of customer service are maintained.
   24.3.3. Managers of appointing agents will ensure that they understand the manning and
   performance requirements of contracted appointing support. They will meet with their
   contract appointing support corporate leadership IAW with their current contract and/or no
   less than twice a year to discuss contract performance and timelines.
   24.3.4. Managers will ensure that that the work area of appointing agents supports their
   health and well being. Lighting, computer support, telephony to include comfortable
   headsets and answering equipment, ergonomics of desks and chairs and the aesthetics of the
   office all optimally support high morale and pride of these personnel performing these
   difficult and tedious tasks. Furnishings will be provided to a level that is comparable to any
   other MTF employee.
   24.3.5. Managers of appointing agents will encourage team work between themselves, the
   support staff and the providers. Appointing agents should be allowed to cross train into other
   clinics or services to ensure that there is coverage during absences of personnel in these other
   areas.
24.4. Access Management Training Resources. Listed below are links and courses offered by
the Air Force that provide information and instruction in the areas of access improvement:

UMD—Unit Manning Document

Terms
Ambulatory Data Module—An automated information module designed to effectively track
and manage ambulatory patient care. It collects and reports patient diagnosis and procedures,
enabling providers to track and manage the care provided to their patients.
Appointment Order Processing—A CHCS functionality for booking only specialty care
referrals/consults. Use of AOP booking will ensure the appointment is linked to the
referral/consult in CHCS. CHCS Referral Booking will not be used to book appointments for
specialty care consults/ referrals to the MTF/DCS.
Access To Care—The Congressionally mandated standards that TRICARE Prime beneficiary
wait times for acute, routine, wellness and specialty care services will not exceed 24 hours, 7
days, and 28 days respectively.
CHCS Referral Booking—This is an old booking option and will not be used to book
appointments for specialty care referrals/ consults to the MTF/DCS. Only AOP Booking will be
used for this process. CHCS Referral Booking can be used to book referrals to network
providers.
Clinic Staff—For purposes of this AFI, clinic staff refers to privileged providers, nurses,
Medical Technician (4N), and Health Services Management (4A) and/or contractors or civil
service equivalent staff supporting clinic operations.
Consult—The act or an instance of referring a TRICARE beneficiary to another authorized
provider for the evaluation of a specific medical issue where the consulting provider provides
advice to the referring provider without treating the patient. This definition does not refer to
CHCS functionalities. Definitions in CHCS and AHLTA: The above definition does not apply
to CHCS and AHLTA functionalities. In CHCS and AHLTA, “consult” and “referral” are used
interchangeably for specialty care requests entered by a provider into the system and may cover
both advice and/or treatment. However, consults and referrals are each processed very
differently as follows: Consults are tracked and must be reviewed, routed, and resulted with
results linked to the consult. Referrals are not tracked the same way and there is no requirement
to review, route, or document results on a referral (unless it is converted to a consult). The AOP
Booking option must be used to book appointments for consults. Referral Booking must be used
if booking network referrals.
Family Health Team—A Primary Care health care team comprised of 2 PCMs, one a
credentialed physician and the other a non-physician credentialed extender, with available
support staff responsible to deliver or arrange primary health care for an enrolled population.
LWOBS—The patient has an appointment, arrives at the clinic, and is checked in, but decides to
leave without seeing the provider.
Preventive Health Assessment (PHA) Cell—A distinct functional office with a distinct
functional accounting code falling under the SGP. The Cell manages the administrative tracking,
notification, processing and quality control of PHAs
AFI44-176_59MDWSUP_I 18 APRIL 2012                                                           85


Primary Care Clinic—A clinic responsible to deliver primary care services to an enrolled set of
patients. It includes family medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine, and flight medicine.
Primary Care Manager—An enrolled beneficiary’s primary care provider who provides all
non-emergency, non-mental health care services including specialty referrals when necessary.
The PCM may be an MTF or network provider.
Primary Care Manager by Name—An initiative to ensure that each patient is assigned to an
individual provider instead of a larger team of providers.
Primary Care Optimization—A concept that addresses how health care is organized and
delivered to ensure optimal and comprehensive patient care at every visit.
Referral—The act or an instance of referring a TRICARE beneficiary to another authorized
provider to obtain necessary medical treatment for a specific medical issue. The treatment may
entail an admission, procedure, or a specialty consultation. This definition does not refer to
CHCS functionalities. For information on processing a referral in CHCS and AHLTA, refer to
the referral definition under “Consult.”
Right of First Refusal—The method for determining if an MTF has the specialty capability as
reflected in the SAL, has an available specialty care appointment, and can make that appointment
within the Access to Care standards. Those standards state that specialty care must be appointed
within 28 days or sooner if so requested by the PCM.
