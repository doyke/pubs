                                            Chapter 1

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. General. This document describes all the processes used by the AOC WS across the full
spectrum of military operations with a primary emphasis on major contingency operations.
During smaller-scale contingencies or day-to-day operations, the AOC may not employ all the
capabilities or teams described herein. The AOC described in this AFI is both an AF unit and a
weapons system that may be employed by the COMAFFOR to exercise control of AF forces, or
form the core of a joint (or combined) AOC (JAOC) and be employed by the Joint Force Air
Component Commander (JFACC) to exercise control of joint (or combined) air forces. In
addition, the COMAFFOR may tailor the organizational construct of their AOC team as required
to support their specific mission and available manning. Since the AOC is normally employed,
with joint augmentation, as the core of a JAOC, under the command of a JFACC, and since the
AOC and JAOC processes and procedures are the same, for purposes of this AFI we will use the
terms COMAFFOR and AOC only when addressing AF specific AOC employment and
JFACC/JAOC when addressing broader, joint or combined AOC employment. Functional
AOCs, to include the 624th Operations Center (AFCYBER), will be addressed in the functional
MAJCOM/unit supplements and Chapter 9 due to the specific nature of their organizational
structure and differing processes from the geographic AOCs.
1.1. (AMC)General. The 618 AOC (TACC) is a unique AOC to a functional command that
operates in simultaneous support of multiple warfighters globally. This supplement to the AFI
documents the unique processes, organization and authorities required of the 618 AOC (TACC).
     1.1.1. During daily operations, if a team or process identified in this AFI or supplement is
     employed then guidance in this AFI will apply. In support of national security policy, the
     USAF provides the full range of capabilities to commanders at all levels. The USAF uses the
     air and space expeditionary task force (AETF) concept to present the appropriate mix of
     ready forces and a means to command and control (C2) those forces. In addition, the USAF
     will transition its C2 systems and processes across the full range and all phases of military
     operations (phase 0 through phase 5) as outlined in Joint Publication (JP) 5-0 Joint
     Operational Planning. (Phase 0 – Shape; I – Deter; II – Seize the Initiative; III – Dominate;
     IV – Stabilize; V – Enable Civil Authority.) While joint and USAF doctrine state that one
     individual will normally be dual-hatted as COMAFFOR and JFACC, the two responsibilities
     are different, and should be executed through different staffs. Normally, the COMAFFOR
     executes operational and administrative control of assigned and attached USAF forces
     through an AOC and the Air Force Forces (AFFOR) staff. The JFACC executes tactical
     control of joint air and space component forces through a JAOC.
     1.1.2. Based on the tenet of centralized planning and control, and decentralized execution,
     the AOC enables the JFACC to exercise operational-level C2 of air and space forces. When
     multinational operations are involved, the JFACC becomes a combined force air and space
     component commander (CFACC). This AFI does not specifically address how to integrate
     foreign nationals or foreign disclosure concerns when a JAOC becomes a Combined Air
     Operations Center (CAOC). Finally, although this AFI briefly discusses COMAFFOR
     responsibilities and Component Headquaters (C-HQ) organization, its focus is on the AOC, a
     new AFFOR AFI currently in draft will cover these relationships.
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                                7


1.2. Employment. When conducting combined and joint air, space, and cyberspace operations,
the JFC normally designates a JFACC to exercise tactical control (TACON) over air capabilities
and forces in accordance with JP 3-30, Command and Control for Joint Air Operations. The
JFACC responsibilities, executed through the JAOC, include, but are not limited to the
following:
   1.2.1. Development of the Joint Air Operations Plan (JAOP).
   1.2.2. Apportionment recommendation for the joint air effort, in consultation with other
   component commanders.
   1.2.3. Providing centralized direction for the allocation and tasking of capabilities and forces
   made available.
   1.2.4. Providing control, oversight, and guidance during the execution of joint air, space, and
   cyberspace operations.
   1.2.5. Coordinating and integrating joint air operations with the operations of other
   component commanders and forces.
   1.2.6. Assessing results of joint air operations.
   1.2.7. Functioning as supported and supporting commander as directed.
1.3. JFACC Additional Responsibilities Supported by a JAOC. Normally, the JFC assigns
additional responsibilities associated with air operations to the JFACC. Additionally, the JFACC
may provide specialized support to other components. When delegated these responsibilities, the
JFACC becomes the supported commander for these theater functions.
   1.3.1. Area Air Defense Commander (AADC). Since airspace operations, and defense of
   that airspace and everything below it, are inherently linked and are an integral part of joint air
   operations, the JFC normally designates the JFACC as the AADC. The AADC is assigned
   overall responsibility for air and missile defense of the Joint Operations Area (JOA). As the
   AADC, the JFACC employs the JAOC to coordinate with other components and develop the
   Area Air Defense Plan (AADP) for JFC approval. Once approved, the JAOC plans,
   coordinates, and manages air defense and missile operations.
   1.3.2. Airspace Control Authority (ACA). The JFC normally designates the JFACC as the
   ACA. The ACA has overall responsibility for controlling the airspace in the JOA and
   operation of the Airspace Control System in the Airspace Coordination Area. The ACA
   coordinates, develops, and issues the Airspace Control Plan (ACP) and Airspace Control
   Orders (ACO), which provide guidance and procedures for use and control of airspace
   activities.
   1.3.3. Collection Management Authority (CMA). CMA is the authority to establish,
   prioritize and validate theater collection requirements, establish sensor tasking guidance and
   develop theater collection plans. IAW JP 2.01, Joint and National Intelligence Support to
   Military Operations, Collection operation management (COM) is the authoritative direction,
   scheduling, and control of specific collection operations and associated processing,
   exploitation, and dissemination resources. COM is the inherent responsibility of the JFACC
   when delegated the responsibility for theater airborne intelligence, surveillance, and
   reconnaissance (ISR) operations. The JFACC will also likely exercise Collection
   Requirements Management (CRM) of assigned units and receive collection requirements
8                                             AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


    from other CRM authorities. IAW JP 2.01, Joint and National Intelligence Support to
    Military Operations, CRM is the authoritative development and control of collection
    processing, exploitation, and/or reporting requirements that normally result in either the
    direct tasking of assets over which the collection manager has authority, or the generation of
    tasking requests to CMA at higher, lower, or lateral echelon to accomplish the collection
    mission. How the JAOC supports these responsibilities is delineated in Chapter 6,
    Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Division.
    1.3.4. Space Coordination Authority (SCA). The SCA is responsible for coordinating and
    integrating space capabilities and is responsible for joint space operations planning. In a
    joint force, the SCA, normally supported by assigned/attached embedded space personnel,
    serves as the focal point for gathering space requirements in support of the JFC’s campaign.
    To ensure prompt and timely support, the supported Geographic Combatant Commander
    (GCC) and Commander, USSTRATCOM may authorize direct liaison between the SCA and
    applicable components of US Strategic Command. These requirements include requests for
    space services and capabilities to achieve space effects. The SCA develops a recommended
    prioritized list of space requirements for the JTF based on JFC objectives.
    1.3.5. Jamming Control Authority (JCA). IAW JP 3-13.1, Electronic Warfare, the JCA is
    the commander designated to assume overall responsibility for the operation of Electronic
    Attack (EA) assets in the Area of Responsibility (AOR)/JOA. This responsibility assumes the
    JCA can access the Joint Communications-Electronics Operating Instructions (JCEOI) and
    Joint Restricted Frequency List (JRFL), can analyze immediate jamming requests for
    frequency interference issues (to include harmonic interference), and can ensure positive C2
    of jamming assets in order to start/stop jamming activity.
    1.3.6. Supported Commander for Personnel Recovery (PR). IAW JP 3-50, Personnel
    Recovery, the supported commander for PR is the joint force component commander
    designated by the JFC with the overall authority to plan, coordinate, and conduct joint PR
    operations and activities within the JFC's operational area. If the JFC designates the JFACC
    as the supported commander for PR, the Joint Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC) should be
    integrated into the JFACC’s JAOC. The JFACC must also retain a Personnel Recovery
    Coordination Cell (PRCC) capability to plan and conduct combat search and rescue (CSAR)
    missions in support of JFACC operations.
    1.3.7. Provision of a Joint Air Component Coordination Element (JACCE). The
    JFACC may establish and deploy a JACCE to each land, maritime, and special operations
    component commanders’ headquarters to better integrate air, space, and cyberspace
    operations with surface/subsurface operations. The JFACC may establish and deploy a
    JACCE to the JFC headquarters to better integrate air, space, and cyberspace operations
    within the overall joint or combined force. The JACCE will be sourced from the C-NAF
    AOC or AFFOR staff, augmentation units or AEF Center/AFPC-identified personnel as well
    as SMEs from each of the sister services as needed. If possible, the C-NAF commander
    should establish a working relationship with JACCE personnel before deployment and
    execution. The JACCE director acts as the air component commander’s personal liaison and
    primary representative to the other commanders in the operation. The JACCE team facilitates
    interaction and communication between the respective staffs. The JACCE performs a liaison
    function and is responsible for understanding (and participating in, if possible) the JFC's/
    JFACC's initial planning and for understanding the other commanders’ plans. The JACCE
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                          9


   team works with their respective counterparts in the AOC and AFFOR staff (JACCE
   reachback) to provide the other HQs commander information on the best way to employ air
   and space power. This is a two-way relationship in that the JACCE not only provides
   information flow to the JFACC but must also help ensure JFACC information is flowing to
   and understood by the JFC, Joint Force Land Component Commander (JFLCC), Joint Force
   Maritime Component Commander (JFMCC), and/or Joint Force Special Operations
   Component Commander (JFSOCC) as applicable. JACCEs will participate in training events
   and exercises with appropriate headquarters organizations to maintain mission readiness.
   1.3.8. (Added-AMC) Intratheater Direct Support (Theater Direct Delivery, or TDD).
   Direct support intratheater air mobility missions are coordinated between the AOC’s AMD
   and the Deployment Distribution and Operations Center (DDOC), if one exists, and tasked
   by the 618 AOC (TACC) when a theater requires an enduring intratheater capacity for
   outsized cargo or to move larger numbers of passengers. In this case, an alternative to
   changing OPCON of strategic forces to theater is to establish a support command
   relationship between CDRUSTRANSCOM and the using GCC. USTRANSCOM makes
   aircraft and crews available for tasking to the supported GCC. The theater DDOC validates
   requirements which are then planned and executed by the 618 AOC (TACC). In such cases,
   a theater direct delivery LNO is established in the supported JAOC.
1.4. AOC Weapon System (WS) Program Responsibilities.
1.4. (AMC)618 AOC (TACC) Weapon System (WS) Program Responsibilities
   1.4.1. Headquarters Air Force (HAF). AF/A3O-AC provides policy, guidance and
   advocacy for the AOC WS and is the OPR for this AFI. This division is the HAF Functional
   Area Manager (FAM) for the AOC WS. AF/A3O-AC is responsible for AOC functional
   areas to include organizational constructs, crew constructs, training, operations and
   maintenance funding, Unit Type Code (UTC) development, special experience identifier
   (SEI) development and other related issues. Other HAF staff agencies provide support as
   required.
   1.4.2. Air Combat Command (ACC). IAW AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation and
   Responsibilities for Weapons Systems, ACC is the Lead Command for the AOC WS.
   ACC/A3 through A3C is the primary office of responsibility for current operations, training,
   and maintenance issues. AFC2IC/C2C is the primary office of responsibility for AOC WS
   requirements and modernization. AFC2IC/C2C is also responsible for providing guidance
   and oversight to the AOC WS System Program Office (SPO) regarding AOC WS
   sustainment and fielding. For specific Lead Command duties and responsibilities, see AFPD
   10-9. Also refer to additional guidance from ACC/CC and SAF/AQ Program Management
   Directives (PMD). ACC/A3C, in coordination with other MAJCOM and ACC staff offices,
   is responsible for providing guidance for AOC WS initial qualification training (IQT),
   mission qualification training (MQT), and continuation training (CT). ACC/A3C also
   provides oversight for the AOC Formal Training Unit (FTU) and additional AOC IQT
   courses such as Joint Air and Space Operations Senior Staff Course (JSSC). ACC/A3C will
   also provide leadership, guidance, and management of AOC tactics, techniques, and
   procedures (TTP), training task list (TTL) development, AFI development, configuration
   management, and operating, functional and employment concept development as well as
   other areas as determined by AF/A3O-AC.

     1.4.2.1. (Added-AMC) A comprehensive Initial Qualification Training (IQT) for the
     TACC is accomplished by the USAF Expeditionary Center (EC) Mobility Operations
     School (MOS) Det 2, co-located with the TACC at Scott AFB. Mission Qualification
     Training (MQT) is accomplished through training in the AOC itself. Training guidance
     for the 618 AOC (TACC) can be found in AFI 13-1AOC v1, AMC Sup, 19 Mar 2013.
  1.4.3. HQ Air Mobility Command (AMC), HQ AF Space Command (AFSPC), HQ US
  Air Forces Europe (USAFE), HQ Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), HQ AF Global Strike
  Command (AFGSC) and HQ AF Special Operations Command (AFSOC). MAJCOMs
  ensure, to the maximum extent possible, augmentees are trained in AOC operations and
  processes, as well as provide support and guidance in systems and configuration
  management.        Additionally, if required, MAJCOMs will ensure specific training,
  certification, and evaluation requirements for enabler personnel and Functional AOCs under
  their direction are identified in supplements to AFI 13-1 AOC, Volume 1, Ground
  Environment Training--Air Operations Center, and AFI 13-1 AOC, Volume 2, Air and Space
  Operations Center Standardization/Evaluation Program—Organization and Administration.
  1.4.4. National Guard Bureau (NGB) and HQ Air Force Reserve Command
  (AFRC). The NGB and AFRC identify, associate and earmark selected units for dedicated
  AOC support. These units, considered essential “first line” associated forces for their
  respective AOC, will conduct regular training, theater visits, and collaborative planning with
  the aligned AOC. Additionally, NGB and AFRC provide headquarters oversight for all ARC
  units associated with AOCs. If required, NGB and AFRC will ensure specific training and
  evaluation requirements for these units are identified in supplements to AFI 13-1 AOC,
  Volume 1, Ground Environment Training—Air Operations Center, and AFI 13-1 AOC,
  Volume 2, Air and Space Operations Center Standardization/Evaluation Program—
  Organization and Administration.
  1.4.5. USAF Warfare Center (USAFWC). The AWFC, through the 505th Command and
  Control Wing (505 CCW), supports the AOC WS in almost every aspect of training. The 505
  CCW provides formal initial WS, division, and team lead training, as well as supports, when
  requested, follow-on continuation and exercise training. The 505 CCW also supports
  weapons system testing and experimentation. Additionally, it provides support of the
  Operational Warfighter/Coalition Warfighter (OW/CW) program and Operational Command
  Training Program (OCTP) operations. OCTP provides Senior Advisors and subject matter
  experts supporting peer level feedback to JFACC, AOC Commander, division, and team
  leads enhancing their skills at the operational level of war. All formal training developed by
  the 505 CCW for the AOC will be approved by ACC/A3.
  1.4.6. Electronic Systems Center (ESC). ESC maintains an AOC systems program office
  (SPO) for AOC systems integration development, modernization, and certification to
  participate in the overall USAF C2 enterprise. Per AFPD 10-9, ESC is designated the
  systems program manager (SPM) for the AOC WS. For specific SPM responsibilities,
  reference AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation and Responsibilities for Weapons
  Systems.
     1.4.6.1. (Added-AMC) . The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC)
     maintains an AOC Systems Program Office (SPO) for geographic AOC systems
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                         11


     integration. AMC has internal software development and acquisition organizations that
     support the TACC.
  1.4.7. Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC). AFPC is responsible for assigning individuals
  E-1 through O-5 to an AOC and ensuring these individuals are assigned to the AOC FTU via
  permanent change of station (PCS). Additionally, they update and maintain AOC SEIs in the
  Air Force Officer Classification Directory and Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory as
  directed by AF/A3O-AC. They maintain a record of AOC personnel who were awarded an
  AOC SEI. They manage career development for professional C2 warriors with AOC
  experience. They also establish procedures for tracking AOC experience and facilitate
  MAJCOM sourcing of experienced AOC personnel.
     1.4.7.1. (Added-AMC) AFPC is responsible for assigning individuals E-1 through O-8
     to the TACC via permanent change of station (PCS). Presently, because the TACC is a
     functional AOC and the skills do not translate directly to geographic AOCs, the TACC
     does not maintain AOC Special Experience Identifiers (SEIs) in the Air Force Officer
     Classification Directory and Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory.

               AIR OPERATIONS CENTER WEAPON SYSTEM (AOC WS)

2.1. Mission. The AOC provides operational-level C2 of air, space, and cyberspace operations.
It is the focal point for planning, directing, and assessing air, space, and cyberspace operations to
meet JFACC operational objectives and guidance. The regional scope of Geographic AOCs and
disparate, global scope of Functional AOCs, require AOCs to be tailored to efficiently and
effectively plan and execute their steady-state missions. Although the USAF provides the core
manpower for the AOC, other service components provide personnel in support of exercises and
contingency operations. The AOC coordinates closely with superior and subordinate C2 nodes,
as well as the headquarters of other functional and service component commands to integrate the
numerous aspects of air, space, and cyberspace operations and accomplish its mission. Actions
at the joint force level establish the requirements for the Theater Air Ground System (TAGS), to
include the CCDR’s guidance, perspective, and strategy for the AOR (the JFC’s JOA strategy [if
the JFC is not the CCDR], command organization, and relationships; the campaign plan;
assignment of objectives; and apportionment of forces). Personnel assigned to, or working with,
the TAGS must understand the decision processes and problems associated with the operational
and tactical levels of command. Armed with this knowledge, commanders and staffs will better
understand TAGS functions and how to work within the system to receive or give support. The
AOC is the senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS) which, along with the
Army Air to Ground Systems (AAGS), Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS),
Navy Tactical Air Control system (NTACS), and the Special Operations Air Ground System
(SOAGS) comprise the TAGS. The TACS is composed of airborne and ground-based C2
elements. Airborne elements of the theater air control system (AETACS) are the Airborne
Warning and Control System (AWACS) and the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System
(JSTARS). The ground elements are the AOC, Control and Reporting Center (CRC), Air Support
Operations Center (ASOC), and Tactical Air Control Party (TACP). To effectively integrate the
TACS elements, the AOC develops and establishes theater-wide C2 guidance of regular and
irregular warfare (IW), providing overarching direction to all the TACS elements. For further
information on the TAGS/TACS, see AFTTP (I) (MTTP), TAGS and AFTTP 3-1, TACS and
other TACS WS TTPs. IAW AFDD-2, Operations and Organization, the primary functions
performed by the AOC are:
2.1. (AMC) Mission. Tasks 2.1.4. thru 2.1.8. are not performed by the functional AOC, but
several tasks are shared with 18 AF as outlined in this paragraph and table 9.1.
   2.1.1. Develop strategy and planning documents from phase 0 through phase 5 that integrate
   air, space, and cyberspace operations (IO) to meet JFACC objectives and guidance.
   2.1.1. (AMC) 18 AF/A3 assumes responsibility to develop strategy and planning documents
   from phase 0 through phase 5 that integrate air, space, and cyberspace operations (IO) to
   meet JFACC objectives and guidance.
   2.1.2. Task and execute day-to-day air, space, and information operations; provide rapid
   reaction, positive control, and coordinate and deconflict weapons employment as well as
   integrate the total operations effort.
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                             13


   2.1.3. Receive, assemble, analyze, filter, and disseminate all-source intelligence and
   meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) effects information to support air, space, and
   cyberspace operations planning, execution, and assessment.
   2.1.4. Issue airspace control procedures and coordinate airspace control activities for the
   ACA when the JFACC is designated the ACA.
   2.1.5. Integrate space capabilities and coordinate space activities for the JFACC.
   2.1.6. Issue space control procedures and coordinate space control activities for SCA when
   the JFACC is designated as SCA.
   2.1.7. Provide overall direction of air defense, including theater and ballistic missile defense
   (TMD/BMD), when the JFACC is designated the AADC.
   2.1.8. Plan, task, and execute the theater USAF airborne ISR mission.
   2.1.9. Conduct operational/tactical level assessment to determine mission and overall
   effectiveness as required by the JFC to support the theater assessment.
   2.1.10. Produce and disseminate ATOs, ACOs, Special Instructions (SPINS), operational
   tasking data link (OPTASK LINK), tactical operational data (TACOPDAT), and COP
   guidance, and any associated changes.
   2.1.11. Plan and task air mobility operations according to the theater priorities.
   2.1.12. Specific functions of the AOC can be found in unit standard operating procedures.
   2.1.13. (Added-AMC) 618 AOC (TACC) Mission. AOCs must be tailored to efficiently
   and effectively plan and execute their steady-state missions. The 618 AOC (TACC) is an Air
   Force AOC weapon system established for planning, directing and executing global air
   mobility operations providing combat and strategic airlift, air refueling, and aeromedical
   evacuation capabilities in support of Combatant Commanders (CCDRs) operational or
   campaign objectives as the air component of USTRANSCOM. Fusion center representatives
   consult with USTRANSCOM to refine and assess the feasibility of CCMD requirements.
   When existing node capacity does not meet mission requirements, 618 AOC (TACC)
   informs 18 AF (AFTRANS) who coordinates changes to the Global Air Mobility Support
   System (GAMSS) with the USAF EC and/or AMC/A4. When mode capacity does not meet
   requirements, 618 AOC (TACC) informs 18 AF (AFTRANS) who coordinates changes to
   the COMAFFOR allocation and apportionment process (CAAP) with AMC/A3. 18 AF/CC
   further delineates 618 AOC (TACC) authorities in an annual standing OPORD.
2.2. Component – Headquarters Organizations. AF components to Unified Combatant
Commands are made up of a Component MAJCOM (C-MAJCOM) only (e.g. PACAF), a
Component MAJCOM and a Component NAF (C-NAF) (e.g. USAFE and 3rd AF) or a
Component NAF only (e.g. USAFCENT). Component Headquarters will include, at a
minimum, the ability to exercise command and control (normally an AOC) and an Air Force
Forces (AFFOR) staff. C-NAFs are NAFs that serve a component role, either subordinate to the
component MAJCOM or as a service component. USAF component functions are integrated
into existing MAJCOM and NAF structures defined in AFI 38-101, Manpower and
Organization, AF Organization. C-NAF headquarters will be properly structured, equipped,
manned, and trained to execute C2 of air, space, and cyberspace operations assigned or attached
to the unified component commander (UCC) for day-to-day operations with the ability to accept
 14                                          AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


additional AOC forces for any increase in UCC mission tasking or direction. A C-NAF will
normally look as shown in Figure 2.1 C-NAF Unit Structure.
2.2. (AMC) AMC Organization
   2.2.1. (Added-AMC) As the air component command to USTRANSCOM, AMC/CC is
   AFTRANS/CC. The nomenclature 18 AF (AFTRANS) is used to designate 18 AF as the
   subordinate C-NAF to the C-MAJCOM. AMC/CC delegates operational control and
   appropriate authorities to 18 AF/CC to execute the AFTRANS mission. In that situation, the
   title 18 AF/CC (AFTRANS) signifies that 18 AF/CC is executing component responsibilities
   on behalf of the AFTRANS/CC.
      2.2.1.1. (Added-AMC) AFTRANS is composed of AMC, 18 AF, 618 AOC (TACC),
      forces SecDef assigns to AMC, and AMC gained Air Reserve Component forces.
   2.2.2. (Added-AMC) As the air component command to USTRANSCOM, AMC is
   designated Air Forces Transportation (AFTRANS). Accordingly, AMC/CC is
   AFTRANS/CC and is the commander of air force forces (COMAFFOR) to USTRANSCOM.
      2.2.2.1. (Added-AMC) The COMAFFOR delegates OPCON to 18 AF/CC to assess
      operational risk and execute operational level of war decisions. When the COMAFFOR
      delegates operational command and authorities to the 18 AF/CC, 18 AF/CC assumes the
      title 18 AF (AFTRANS).
      2.2.2.2. (Added-AMC) The 18AF staff, together with the shared AMC staff and AOC,
      provides the 18 AF/CC the ability to monitor, assess, plan and execute world-wide
      mobility missions as the air component execution arm to USTRANSCOM.
      2.2.2.3. (Added-AMC) 18 AF (AFTRANS)/CC delegates tactical control (TACON) to
      618 AOC (TACC)/CC of the AMC gained and assigned forces made available for
      allocation and execution. Specific authorities are spelled out in the annual 18 AF standing
      execution order (EXORD).
      2.2.2.4. (Added-AMC) Further delineation of roles, responsibilities, relationships and
      authorities are outlined in Table 9.1.
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                          15


Figure 2.1. C-NAF Unit Structure.




(Note: The AOC is an AF unit. The AOC Commander is responsible for the day-to-day
readiness of the AOC. When the AOC is employed in contingency operations, the AOC should
be prepared to transition, with appropriate joint augmentation, to a JAOC and the AOC
commander should be prepared to serve as the JAOC Commander.)
2.3. AOC Organization. The AOC organization includes an AOC Commander, five divisions
(Strategy; Combat Plans; Combat Operations; Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance;
and Air Mobility), and multiple specialty and support teams. Depending upon the mission, scope
and level of effort, each AOC will configure appropriately and integrate numerous disciplines in
a cross-functional team approach to monitoring, assessing, planning and executing (see Figure
2.2 AOC Organization and Functional Teams). The specific organization and processes for
each AOC division will be discussed in later chapters. AOC Commanders and direct reporting
AOC positions will be discussed below. Not all of the organizations and capabilities shown in
Figure 2.2 may exist in an AOC during peacetime and/or major contingency operations because
of the specific scope or mission of that AOC.

Given the magnitude and volume of activity in the TACC as well as its roles and relationships
around the world, the organization is structured with directorates, divisions, branches and a
separate support staff. This is in contrast with the more compact geographic AOC, employing an
augmentation plan, and fluctuations in levels of activity.

   and near-term planning (phase 0 to phase 5) of air, space, and cyberspace operations to
   achieve theater objectives by developing, refining, disseminating, and assessing the JFACC
   strategy guidance. SD activities are primarily reflected in the joint air operations plan
   (JAOP), the air operations directive (AOD), and the operational assessment report (OAR).
   The SD is divided into three teams: strategy plans team (SPT), strategy guidance team
   (SGT), and operational assessment team (OAT). In peace time, the information operations
   (IO) team which supports all AOC divisions is administratively under the SD chief. When
   in contingency operations the IOT is considered a specialty team and will be discussed in
   chapter 8. Despite proximity to the ATO planning, production, and execution areas within
   the AOC, SD personnel should not become caught up in execution details. See Chapter 3 for
   an in-depth discussion of the SD.
   2.3.2. (AMC) The 618 AOC Commander. “The AOC Commander is charged with
   effectively managing air component operations and establishing the AOC battle rhythm. The
   AOC commander develops and directs processes to plan, coordinate, allocate, task, execute,
   and assess air component operations in the AOR/JOA based on JFC and
   COMAFFOR/JFACC guidance” (AFDD 1, 14 October 2011). In the Global Mobility
   functional AOC, the ‘AOR’ is the worldwide operations of USTRANSCOM.

  Chief and personnel are responsible to the JFACC and JAOC for assessing and anticipating
  adversary activity in the operational environment, managing ISR operations, and developing
  dynamic targeting strategies in order to rapidly, discreetly and efficiently achieve the
  JFACC/JFC priority effects. The ISR division is comprised of four teams: analysis,
  correlation, and fusion (ACF) team; targets/tactical assessment (TA) team; ISR Operations
  team; and the processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) management team.
  Additionally, as mission needs dictate, the ISR division integrates ISR personnel within other
  teams in the AOC. See Chapter 6 for an in-depth discussion on the ISR division.
  2.3.6. Air Mobility Division (AMD). The AMD chief and personnel plan, coordinate, task,
  and execute the air mobility mission in support of the AOC air, space, and cyberspace
  operations planning and execution processes. The AMD consists of four teams: airlift control
  team (ALCT), air refueling control team (ARCT), air mobility control team (AMCT), and
  aeromedical evacuation control team (AECT). Representatives within the AMD will be
  matrixed throughout other divisions. See Chapter 7 for an in-depth discussion on the AMD.
  2.3.7. AOC Commander’s Staff.
     2.3.7.1. ATO Coordination Team. (AFSC: 11/12/13/14). The AOC Commander will
     determine the size of the overall ATO coordination team. Each ATO is assigned an
     experienced two-person or greater cell. ATO coordinators are active participants in key
     AOC battle rhythm processes throughout the entire ATO cycle; help ensure effective and
     efficient production, dissemination, and execution of each assigned ATO; and ensure
     guidance is appropriately/accurately integrated and maintained in all applicable AOC
     processes. As the primary focal point for their assigned ATO, ATO cells help maintain
     continuity of effort across the seams between AOC divisions/teams and resolve issues as
     required. ATO coordinators should have appropriate special technical operations (STO)
     and special access program (SAP) clearances to facilitate coordination required to
     adequately integrate the planning and execution of each ATO and associated STO and
     SAP activities. If required, additional expertise from space, IO, and intelligence can be
     added to the team. Specific ATO Coordinator duties can be found in AFTTP 3-3.AOC,

        solutions.
     2.3.7.5. AOC Process Improvement Team (PIT). The AOC PIT is formed and
     directed by the AOC Commander. The team’s purpose is to evaluate overall
     effectiveness of the AOC WS and develop recommendations to improve information
     flow within the AOC. The team focuses on AOC processes, and data and information
     flows and recommends changes that will improve the flow of information throughout the
     AOC. Data flow is one of the most challenging areas in the AOC. Lessons learned from
     recent AOC operations make it clear there must be an established data management plan
     (DMP) prior to beginning of a conflict. The AOC PIT, when established, will develop the
     DMP portion of the knowledge operations plan. The DMP is a plan (approved by the
     AOC Commander or delegated authority) that establishes collection personnel, collection
     responsibilities, and data elements to be collected. It also establishes the format in which
     the data will be submitted. The AOC PIT consists of a small cadre of operators,
     communicators, process and system engineers and operations research analysts, who
     oversee, evaluate and help improve processes and data flow within the AOC. The cadre is
     led by a senior analyst responsible to the AOC Commander.
        2.3.7.5.1. AOC PIT Chief. A senior AOC member familiar with AOC operations
        and has an in-depth understanding of AOC roles and responsibilities and how AFFOR
        staff and outside agencies support and interact with the AOC. This individual will
        ensure AOC PIT members fully understand AOC processes and data flow
        requirements in the knowledge operations plan (formerly known as the information
        management plan).
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                          23


           2.3.7.5.2. AOC PIT Manning and Organization. Operations research analysts,
           operators, communicators, intelligence analysts, process and systems engineers, and
           air mobility experts comprise the AOC PIT. Initial assignments should be focused on
           internal (by division) processes and external (joint, coalition, partner nation (PN)
           other government agency [OGA], etc.)) relationships enabling AOC PIT to observe,
           document, and assist in ensuring data flow and processes support overall AOC
           processes. The goal is to understand how internal AOC organizations interact with
           each other as well as how those same organizations relate to other organizations
           outside the AOC and to improve AOC processes.
           2.3.7.5.3. AOC PIT Processes.
              2.3.7.5.3.1. Identify the AOC PIT members. After identification, if a process
              analyst is not available at the NAF/MAJCOM, augment with personnel who can
              develop required products.
              2.3.7.5.3.2. Develop draft integrated DMP tailored for local operation.
              2.3.7.5.3.3. Develop and document in an integrated DMP report.
              2.3.7.5.3.4. Analyze trends and improvements in data collection in the AOC.
              2.3.7.5.3.5. Develop recommendations and solutions to correct deficiencies and
              improve AOC processes and division integration.
2.4. Theater Air Ground System (TAGS). The AOC plans and executes the air tasking order
(ATO), airspace control order (ACO), data link guidance etc. with inputs from the entire C2
organization which includes numerous tactical air and ground C2 weapons systems from all
services grouped under the name TAGS. For further information on the TAGS, recommend
reading Air, Land, and Sea Application Center (ALSA) Publication titled TAGS.

2.5. HQ USAF PAD 10-02 C-NAF C2 Restructure. This Program Action Directive (PAD)
was developed to identify how forces are to be organized to support global contingency
operations and provide operational command and control and operational support through the
AOC and Air Force Forces (AFFOR) staff. In addition, the PAD established manning at AOCs
to be capped to support Phase 0 and 1 operations. To mitigate the risk of reduced manning three
risk mitigation efforts were established. The risk mitigation efforts are the Rapid Augmentation
Team (RAT), Operational Support Center (OSC), and the refinement of the Air Reserve
Component (ARC) aligned units. Further information can be found in the 2 June 2010 HQ
USAF PAD 10-02.
   2.5.1. Operational Support Center (OSC). The OSC has been established at Joint Base
   Langley-Eustis, VA to provide data backup support and core Continuity of Operations
   (COOP) to C-NAFs as required. Further information can be found in the Operational Support
   Facility (OSF) Enabling Concept. Note: The OSC is the unit that is located within the OSF
   which is in the Ryan Center on JB Langley-Eustis, VA.
   2.5.2. Rapid Augmentation Team (RAT). The RAT is an active duty unit that will be used
   to bridge the capability gap between resident C-NAF crews at the onset of a crisis through
   the arrival of ARC assigned units. The RAT will be maintained at specified levels of

  currency and proficiency, as outlined for CMR in AFI 13-1AOC, Vol 1. Further information
  can be found in the RAT Enabling Concept.
     2.5.2.1. AMC RAT. An Active Component MAF RAT already exists for rapid
     augmentation of Geographic Air Mobility Divisions. Air Mobility Command has two
     Air Mobility Operations Squadrons that will bridge the capability gap between resident
     AMD crew at the onset of a crisis through the arrival and integration of ARC C-NAF
     augmentation units. The AMD Augmentation Concept of Employment describes how
     Air Mobility Divisions will be augmented by active-duty and ARC AMD augmentation
     units.      The document can be found on the AMD CoP at:
     https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-OP-AM-10
  2.5.3. Air Reserve Component (ARC). Each CCDR has been assigned a specific ARC
  aligned unit from the Air National Guard (ANG) and/or the Air Force Reserve Command
  (AFRC). These units are aligned to their respective MAJCOMs and provide integrated
  mission support during exercises and contingencies. In addition, they maintain the CMR
  requirements IAW with 13-1AOC, Vol 1 and are able to support additional CCMDs as
  required. The ARC units are a critical risk mitigation factor for AOC manning, especially in

                                STRATEGY DIVISION (SD)

3.1. General. The SD supports the achievement of JFC objectives by developing, refining,
disseminating, and assessing the JFACC’s air, space, and cyberspace operations strategy for all
phases of a campaign. This strategy is presented in a comprehensive JAOP. The SD is the
JFACC’s focal point for JAOP development during formal or joint operations planning. The SD
works with the AFFOR staff and other service component staffs, as they develop the JAOP. The
SD initiates the air tasking cycle with daily guidance in the AOD.
3.1. (AMC) TACC Operating Procedures
   3.1.1. (Added-AMC) The following further implements and is incomplete without AFI 13-
   1AOC Volume 3. The supplement is not intended to be a single source document for
   procedures contained in other official publications, directives, or regulations.
   3.1.2. (Added-AMC) Detailed operating procedures are captured in the TACC OI 10-1.
3.2. Major SD Process Inputs. Inputs include higher headquarters policy, guidance and intent,
and rules of engagement/rules for the use of force (ROE/RUF). The ROE/RUFs are normally
issued from the President and/or Secretary of Defense, CCDR, JFC, and/or JFACC in applicable
joint operation planning and execution system (JOPES) documentation. Inputs also include joint
force and service/functional component planning documentation, as appropriate. The SD
receives the target developers’ target system analysis and targeting effects team’s apportionment
recommendation to the JFACC. For operational assessment, additional process inputs include
tactical assessment and other appropriate performance measurement summaries. In addition, the
SD receives analytical, targeting, and collection management support from the ISR division.
Refer to chapter 6 for a complete list of responsibilities for ISR operations embedded personnel
in the SD. The SD should obtain combat support status information on assigned and attached
USAF forces from the AOC logistics combat support team (CST).
   3.2.1. (Added-AMC) Introduction. The TACC is 1 of 5 functional AOCs. There are a great
   number of differences between the TACC and the geographic AOC as defined throughout
   AFI 13-1AOC series documents. This document will highlight those differences driven by
   the Mobility Air Forces (MAF) mission. As both a supporting C-MAJCOM, and Lead
   MAJCOM with an ongoing functional role, AMC’s AOC is not directly subordinate to a joint
   (or combined) AOC (JAOC/CAOC), but does support a functional Joint Force Commander
   (CDRUSTRANSCOM) through the 18 AF/CC. The following paragraphs apply to the 618
   AOC (TACC) only.
   3.2.2. (Added-AMC) General Policy. The TACC Commander’s operational policies and
   procedures are captured in the TACC OI 10-1.
   3.2.3. (Added-AMC) Unit Mission. The TACC Mission Statement: Making global reach a
   reality by transforming requirements into executable and effective missions, through efficient
   planning, tasking, execution and assessment of global air mobility operations. In the (Air
   Mobility) functional AOC, the TACC provides C2 in all AORs in support of
   USTRANSCOM’s trans-regional responsibilities. While the fundamentals of Command and
 26                                                     AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


    Control are universal, the methods and tactics of the TACC are driven by this broad mission
    and vary a great deal from those in the geographic AOC.
         3.2.3.1. (Added-AMC) The TACC plans, tasks, executes, and assesses all
         USTRANSCOM-validated air mobility mission requirements. Fusion Center representatives
         consult with USTRANSCOM to refine and assess the feasibility of Combatant Commander
         (CCDR) requirements. When existing node capacity does not meet mission requirements,
         TACC informs 18AF (AFTRANS) who in-turn coordinates with the USAF EC and/or
         AMC/A4 to make changes to the Global Air Mobility Support System (GAMSS). When
         mode capacity does not meet requirements, TACC informs 18 AF (AFTRANS) who in turn
         coordinates with AMC/A3 to make changes to the COMAFFOR Allocation and
         Apportionment Process (CAAP). Table 1.1 depicts a summary of the Roles, Responsibilities,
         Relationships, and Authorities of the C-MAJCOM, C-NAF, and 618 AOC (TACC).

   3.2.4. (Added-AMC) TACC Peacetime Organization. It is important to note that the TACC
   Organization does not change under different levels of activity. Due to the constant support
   of nearly all operational military activity world-wide, the TACC operates in a continuous
   wartime mode. Under exceptional circumstances a contingency team may stand up at the
   onset of a major crisis and will remain in place until routine processes can assume control, or
   the situation subsides. Detailed organizational structure can be found in the TACC OI 10-1.

Figure 3.1. (AMC) TACC Organization.
 28                                          AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


   3.2.5. (Added-AMC) Command and Control. The TACC core function is to provide
   command and control as defined in JP1-02, and IAW AF and Joint Doctrine. TACC OI 10-1
   provides details on how the unit coordinates and delivers C2 capability.
   3.2.6. (Added-AMC) Unit Standards. The unit ensures that specific training, certification,
   and evaluation requirements for their personnel are met IAW AFI 13-1AOC, Volume 1,
   Ground Environment Training--Air Operations Center, AMC Supplement and the Annual
   Training Plan. The TACC does not currently have an AOC Standardization/Evaluation
   Program.
   3.2.7. (Added-AMC) OPSEC procedures. While OPSEC is everyone’s responsibility, the
   TACC Information Operations Division (XOOI) is the focal point for OPSEC procedures.
   XOOI provides integrated information operations (IO) planning, execution, and assessment
   for TACC’s global air mobility mission.
   3.2.8. (Added-AMC) Associated Unit Organization and Support Mission. The TACC is not
   supported with an augmenting unit. The TACC is fully employed 24/7/365 with routine and
   operational missions; therefore this guidance applies at all times. While the TACC does not
   have an augmentation unit, it does have several Air Reserve Component (ARC) members
   (ANG and AFRES/ IMA and traditional support). The unit ensures that specific training,
   certification, and evaluation requirements for these personnel are met IAW AFI 13-1AOC,
   Volume 1, Ground Environment Training--Air Operations Center.
3.3. SD Processes. The SD chief and subordinate teams develop, refine, disseminate, and assess
the progress of the JFACC’s strategy. The chief and the team work the following processes in
support of the JFACC.
   3.3.1. Develop the JFACC air, space, and cyberspace operations estimate of the situation to
   produce a recommended JFC course of action (COA).
   3.3.2. Translate President, Secretary of Defense, JFC, and JFACC guidance into objectives,
   tasks, and assessment measures and indicators.
   3.3.3. Coordinate the development of the approved JFACC COA into a comprehensive joint
   air operations plan (JAOP) or order with appropriate annexes.
   3.3.4. Develop detailed phase plans, which when feasible, will include a joint air allocation
   plan (JAAP) that incorporates TET’s effects based targeting scheme.
   3.3.5. Serve as the primary liaison with JFC planners.
   3.3.6. Develop alternative contingency plans and branch and sequel plans.
   3.3.7. Develop proposed changes to the ROE/RUF.
   3.3.8. Provide the JFACC a daily recommended air apportionment during execution.
   3.3.9. Develop and coordinate AOD.
   3.3.10. Integrate functional/service component task requirements into the AOD.
   3.3.11. Monitor the progress of the air phases and provide operational assessment with
   respect to the JFC/JFACC objectives.
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                          29


   3.3.12. Provide JFACC input to the development of an information operations (IO) plan for
   the JFC.
3.4. Major SD Process Outputs. Outputs include the JAOP, AOD, JFACC apportionment
recommendation for the JFC, and OARs. In addition, the SD develops branch plans, sequel
plans, and special projects and studies as required.
   3.4.1. Joint Air Operations Plan (JAOP). Joint air, space, and cyberspace operations
   constitute an integral part of the JFC’s plan of operations. The JFACC is normally assigned
   responsibility for joint air, space, and cyberspace operations planning and develops a JAOP
   to employ joint forces made available to him/her. The JAOP documents the JFACC’s plan to
   integrate and coordinate operations across all the phases of air power (0 through 5). The
   JAOP is based on the strategy-to-task methodology which consists of objectives, effects, and
   tasks, along with appropriate measures and indicators that enable an assessment of progress
   toward achieving objectives and effects. Because the air and space strategy encompasses
   operations employing air, space, and cyberspace operations weapon systems from all joint,
   coalition, OGA and PN force components, the SPT assigned to develop the plan must
   represent all organizations providing resources.
   3.4.2. Air Operations Directive (AOD). The AOD is JFACC’s written guidance which
   ensures air, space, and cyberspace operations effectively support the combined/joint force
   objectives while retaining enough flexibility to adjust to the dynamics of the range of and
   phases of military operations. The AOD provides operational objectives, effects, and tasks as
   well as their measures of effectiveness/performance for the ATO execution.
   3.4.3. Operational Assessment Report (OAR). This report is completed and sent to the
   JFC or a designated joint force assessment board. The content and format of this report will
   be determined by the particular requirements of the JFC or the assessment board. It will
   normally contain the information provided to the CCDR during the JFACC’s decision
   briefing.
3.5. SD Organization. The SD is led by the SD chief and usually organized into three
functionally oriented teams: SPT, SGT, and OAT. (See Figure 3.1 SD Organization,
Functional Teams, and Major Processes.) Although assigned to the SD in peacetime, the
information operations team (IOT) provides specialty expertise across all divisions within the
AOC and is considered a specialty team and is discussed in Chapter 8 of this AFI.

Figure 3.1. SD Organization, Functional Teams, and Major Processes.




   3.5.1. Strategy Division Chief. (AFSC: 11/12/13B). The SD chief reports to the AOC
   Commander for the development and assessment of air, space, and cyberspace operations
   strategy to support the JFC’s objectives. While reporting through the AOC Commander, it is
   vital the SD chief has direct access to the JFACC. Specific responsibilities include:
      3.5.1.1. Through JFACC or AOC Commander, receive and disseminate higher
      headquarters policy, guidance, and intent as well as establish appropriate contacts at JFC,
      JTF and Component Staff Headquarters.
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                       31


     3.5.1.2. Lead the AOC in the Joint Air Estimate Process (JAEP) to include, development
     of the JAOP, branch and sequel plans, AOD, and OA plan. Produce, as necessary, JAOP
     or joint air allocation plan (JAAP), revisions and changes to the ROE or requests for
     supplemental ROE, and refinements to the commander’s (JFC, JFACC) critical
     information requirements (CCIR). Synchronize the efforts of all AOC divisions and
     specialty/support teams toward production of a coherent, executable plan that meets the
     commander’s guidance and intent.
     3.5.1.3. Develop and manage the battle rhythm sufficient to accomplish JAOP
     development, AOD development, operational assessment, branch and sequel planning,
     special projects, and STO as required.
     3.5.1.4. Ensure JFACC’s guidance is reflected in the AOD.
     3.5.1.5. Ensure positional guides, worksheets, and procedural checklists are developed
     by SD teams, reviewed, and updated for all appropriate duty positions.
     3.5.1.6. Ensure critical planning materials, such as draft and record copy documents,
     slides or briefing materials, minutes from meetings are filed and stored for historical
     record.
     3.5.1.7. Maintain current and thorough understanding of commander’s (e.g., JFC,
     JFACC, etc.) mission, intent, and concept of operations. Review and understand relevant
     theater campaign plans, existing ROE/RUF, and related policy documents. Maintain a
     comprehensive understanding of current and forecast enemy capabilities and limitations
     as well as those of friendly forces.
     3.5.1.8. Review each of SD’s primary deliverables (i.e., JAOP, AOD, SPINS inputs, and
     OA reports.) Establish procedures to secure the JFACC and/or AOC Commander
     approval prior to publication/release, as appropriate.
     3.5.1.9. Identify appropriate SD manning requirements.
     3.5.1.10. Identify SD facilities and equipment requirements.
     3.5.1.11. Lead/direct and provide support to the Air Planning Group/Joint Planning
     Group (APG/JPG) development of the JFC’s campaign plan.
     3.5.1.12. Lead/direct development/modification of ROE/RUF process.
     3.5.1.13. Provide guidance on SD portion of AOC knowledge operations plan.
  3.5.2. Strategy Plans Team (SPT). SPT consists of a small group of assigned members
  along with a tailored group of attached members. Attached members contribute to the
  process, but are not permanently assigned to the team. During crisis action planning with a
  short timeline, a higher manning level may be required to meet time constraints. JPG’s
  requirements may necessitate 24/7 operations and therefore increase manning requirements.
     3.5.2.1. Strategy Plans Team Chief. (AFSC: 11/12/13B). The SPT chief reports to the
     SD chief for the development of long range (next phase) operational alternatives. The
     SPT chief interfaces with the TET chief to integrate the effects and timing of TET’s
     phase targeting scheme in support of the JFACC’s prioritized objectives. SPT is the
     JFACC’s focal point for contingency and crisis action planning and serves as the primary
     interface with the APG/JPG.
32                                         AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


     3.5.2.2. SPT Members. (AFSC: 11/12/13). The SPT may have only one or two core
     members. These members should be fully trained in wartime planning and its
     requirements in order to support APG/JPG needs. Additionally, SPT receives support
     from attached ISR division personnel, STO, and IO personnel and is augmented from
     other AOC divisions, service components, OGA, coalition/PN force components, and
     specialty functions such as space or cyberspace as required in support of JTF or
     contingency operations.
     3.5.2.3. SPT Responsibilities. The SPT’s principal function is the development and
     maintenance of operational-level, long range joint air strategy and associated branch and
     sequel plans that support the JFC and JFACC objectives. The SPT leads the AOC in the
     air estimate process and the associated development of the JAOP to include a prioritized,
     effects-based, targeting scheme. Because these long range strategies and branch plans
     complement the JAOP, the SPT supports development of the area air defense plan
     (AADP) and ACP. During operations execution, the SPT operates beyond the 72-96 hour
     (ATO execution) time frame. The SPT must lead planning for the successful execution of
     the current phase as well as plan for subsequent phases. The SPT is responsible for the
     development and articulation of long range operational guidance for the JAOP which
     may be repeated within the AOD. It can also act as the JFACC’s action group for friendly
     COA development and strategy related issues/special projects. In conjunction with the
     military deception (MILDEC) planner, the SPT integrates MILDEC plans with overall air
     operation as directed by the JFACC. Under the C-NAF construct, the SPT may be called
     upon to assist in the planning of global strike (GS) missions in conjunction with GCCs
     and USSTRATCOM.
     3.5.2.4. SPT Processes and Functions.
         3.5.2.4.1. Lead the JAEP (to include JAOP development).
         3.5.2.4.2. Support APG/JPG/component liaisons for air operations planning.
         3.5.2.4.3. Develop COA and branch and sequel plan(s).
         3.5.2.4.4. Develop JFACC’s intent, objectives, and operational concept.
         3.5.2.4.5. Construct Strategy-to-Task, in conjunction with the OAT, along with the

     officer and may have one or two additional core members. It receives support from all
     other AOC divisions, service components, OGA, coalition/PN force components, and
     specialty functions such as IO, cyberspace, STO, or space as required.
     3.5.3.3. SGT Responsibilities. The SGT operates within the current phase of the
     campaign (current plans) and has the responsibility for crafting and disseminating JFACC
     guidance in the form of the AOD. This team works closely with the OAT to ensure
     guidance contained in the AOD is based on the latest and most accurate assessments of
     the operational environment. The AOD supplements the JAOP and provides more precise
     guidance to support the planning, executing, and assessing of the ATO.
     3.5.3.4. SGT Processes and Functions.
         3.5.3.4.1. Develop, publish and disseminate AOD.

  3.5.4. Operational Assessment Team (OAT). OAT is manned and task-organized to
  support the scope and complexity of a particular contingency, which determines the number
  of personnel assigned to the team. OAT consists of assigned and attached personnel. OAT is
  focused on the daily collection and assessment of data and information from supporting AOC
  divisions and other organizations. Finally, OAT’s daily schedule encompasses the full
  spectrum of the ATO cycle, requiring 24/7 manning coverage in major areas.
     3.5.4.1. Operational Assessment Team Chief. (AFSC: 61S). The OAT chief reports to
     the SD chief and leads the OAT in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the air, space,
     cyberspace, and IO planning and execution. The OAT chief is the JFACC’s primary
     assessment interface with the JFC and other components.
     3.5.4.2. Operational Assessment Team Members. The OAT will typically have the
     following core members: operations research analyst, operational assessment analyst,
     doctrine strategy assessor and weapons and tactics assessor. The OAT may also have
     subject matter expert technicians supporting the assessment effort. The OAT also
     receives support from the ISR division and is augmented from other AOC divisions,
     service components, OGA, coalition/PN force components, and specialty functions such

     3.5.4.3. OAT Responsibilities. The OAT provides the data the JFACC needs to make
     informed decisions concerning the execution of air, space, and cyberspace operations
     strategy. The OAT reviews past events to identify and describe progress in meeting
     current objectives. The OAT then forecasts, based on this historical analysis, the possible
     results and outcomes of continuing and future operations. Functional responsibilities for
     performing operational assessment in the AOC are assigned to OAT. This team, along
     with other SD teams, produces a recommendation to the JFACC, utilizing a foundation of
     data and the fusion of that data. The OAT organizes and exploits a constant flow of
     information from a wide variety of sources. The team identifies and evaluates the
     effectiveness of friendly operations, highlighting opportunities to influence adversary
     COAs and evaluating effects achieved on the adversary’s strategic and operational
     centers of gravity (COG). Finally, the team addresses effects related to the conduct of
     friendly military operations.
     3.5.4.4. OAT Processes.

40                                         AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


        coalition, PN and OGA partners), and design the JFACC’s theater C2 structure. Upon
        publication, the ACP and ACO describe theater airspace system, airspace users, C2
        nodes, and delineate service and C2 responsibilities. Operational considerations,
        safety, host nation/international agreements and political issues are considered during
        the development of the ACP. Additionally, airspace planners produce the ACO on a
        recurring basis using guidance from the ACP.
        4.5.4.3.3. Upon AADC approval, the TACOPDAT establishes air defense
        responsibilities or provides supplementary air defense orders. This message may be
        used to report permanent changes to an OPORD or to update missile engagement
        zones, surveillance and air defense sectors.
        4.5.4.3.4. C2 plans interface control experts develop the OPTASK LINK. The
        OPTASK LINK is a USMTF message that defines theater multi-tactical data link
        network (MTN) architecture. OPTASK LINK provides unit locations, frequencies,
        duties, filter plans, and other link-specific information necessary to operate the MTN.
        All link participants must specifically state their information exchange requirements
        (IERs) as early as possible. Once approved and implemented, the OPTASK LINK
        message is updated periodically based on the changing platform/agency IERs,
        constant flow of interface control capable units to/from the AOR and dynamic nature
        of the MTN architecture. All units, platforms and agencies must provide the C2
        planning cell, interface control officer (ICO)/tactical data link (TDL) manager with
        their current and complete IERs as early as possible in the planning of OPTASK
        LINK.
        4.5.4.3.5. The team manages the SPINS development process by coordinating with
        designated SPINS SMEs, who may reside in other cells and teams within the AOC. It
        is the responsibility of SPINS SMEs to arbitrate and validate inputs and deletions to

5.1. General. The COD executes the current ATO and ACO. The COD accomplishes this task
through constant monitoring of the operational environment and leveraging subordinate C2
TACS capabilities within the TAGS elements, and other assigned assets. In general, the COD
responds to battlefield dynamics by command and control of air and missile defense operations,
IO, and by modifying the published ATO and ACO to facilitate changes in mission requirements.
Depending on the scenario, the COD is composed of offensive and defensive operations (to
include missile defense) teams, the SIDO team (providing ISR operations execution support),
interface control team, and numerous specialty teams such as airspace management, weather,
PRCC, and various experts from other weapons systems. The COD is also supported by various
liaison teams as needed. Examples of these teams are the battlefield coordination detachment
(BCD), Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC), naval and amphibious liaison
element (NALE), special operations liaison element (SOLE), Marine liaison element (MARLE),
coalition/PN liaison teams, and other governmental agency (OGA) liaisons.
5.2. Major COD Process Inputs. JAOP, AOD, ATO Folder, ACP, AADP, ATO with SPINS,
ACO, TACOPDAT, OPTASK LINK, friendly order of battle (FrOB), enemy orders of battle
(EOB), RTL, NSL, PTL, PCL, and RSTA Annex, MAAP brief, ROE/RUF.
5.3. Major COD Processes.
   5.3.1. Provide constant monitoring and support of air missions under control of the TACS.
   5.3.2. Monitor current operations.
   5.3.3. Adjust the ATO as necessary in response to operational environment dynamics (e.g.,
   assigned targets are no longer valid, high priority targets are detected, enemy action threatens
   friendly forces).
   5.3.4. Coordinate and facilitate execution of emergency and immediate air support requests
   with Air Support Operations Center (ASOC).
   5.3.5. Manage and recommend changes to air defense postures and operations.

other subsequent orders to subordinate C2 agencies and Installation command centers (ICCs);
assessment data; and consolidated reports to higher headquarters as required by established
directives.
5.5. COD Organization. Exact composition of the COD is tailored to a specific contingency or
operation, but its general structure is presented in Figure 5.1 COD Organization, Functional
Teams, and Major Processes. The COD is normally task-organized into four functionally
oriented core teams: offensive operations, defensive operations, interface control, and SIDO
operations. The entire COD is also supported by integrated specialty and support teams/cells,
component and coalition/PN/combined/OGA liaisons, and communications support.

  5.5.1. Combat Operations Division Chief. (COD Chief or CCO) (AFSC: 11/12/13B).
  The CCO is directly responsible to the AOC Commander for the direction and supervision of
  combat operations. The CCO will apply JFACC guidance to ensure current tactical air, space,
  IO, and cyberspace operations attain established objectives at the operational level of war.
  The CCO monitors the current situation and advises the AOC Commander of dynamic
  mission requirements and the status of resources. Priority of effort is a key factor in the
  CCO’s approval of any adjustment to the ATO, but equally important is a reassessment of
  basic planning considerations. Continuous coordination with the JFACC staff is essential to
  ensure combat support forces can generate and sustain combat operations. Although the
  following list may vary somewhat depending on theater specifics, the following
  responsibilities constitute the minimum for which the CCO is responsible. The CCO will:
     5.5.1.1. Maintain awareness of all theater air, space, and cyberspace operations including
     force bed-down, sortie rates, airspace procedures, communications, ROE/RUFs,
     munitions capabilities, and individual unit capabilities and limitations.

     coordinated and communicated with associated C2 units, applicable agencies, and the
     chief AOC communications team.
     5.5.1.21. Direct the operations of the TACS.
     5.5.1.22. Ensure mission log summaries for appropriate teams are maintained that
     capture major actions taken during execution of the ATO.
  5.5.2. Offensive Operations Team. The offensive operations team monitors and adjusts
  force application and support sorties/missions during ATO execution. Team members work
  closely with specialty and support teams, component coalition/PN/OGA LNOs, and others to
  ensure the most effective application of air, space, and cyberspace operations power with
  JFACC guidance through the AOD. This team directs engagement of dynamic and time
  sensitive targets through either a subordinate targeting cell or as a fully embedded function.
     5.5.2.1. Senior Offensive Duty Officer (SODO). (AFSC: 11/12/13B). The SODO is
     directly responsible to the COD chief for the direction and supervision of all offensive
     operations and may assist with chief responsibilities. The SODO supervises the activities

     to effectively utilize multi-role assets ISO CCO directions.
     5.5.2.2. Senior Offensive Duty Officer Technician (SODOT). (AFSC: 1C5). The
     SODOT is normally a senior non-commissioned officer (NCO) with an in depth
     knowledge of COD functions and responsibilities, as well as a comprehensive knowledge
     of C2 system operations. SODOT is directly responsible to the SODO and supports the
     SODO as required.
     5.5.2.3. Offensive Operations Team Members.
        5.5.2.3.1. Offensive Duty Officers (ODOs). (AFSC: 11/12/13B/14). The offensive
        operations team consists of duty officers from various individual mission design
        series (MDS) engaged in the theater of operations and form cells organized by
        function (e.g., EW, CAS, interdiction, airlift, tanker, IO, SPACE) or may be
        organized along other lines established by COD leadership (e.g., F16, A10, or F-15E
        ODO reporting directly to the SODO). Normally, during increased activity, numerous
        MDS expertise will be represented at all times on the COD floor. In some situations
        though, this expertise may be shared with CPD, but this arrangement must have a
        clear understanding of tasking priority between CPD and COD as well as an
        expeditious means of recall.        The ODOs must know the details of each
        mission/package in which their aircraft participate such as ordnance, primary target,
        secondary target, assigned pre-strike and post-strike tanker(s) orbits, off-load,
        required EW support, and mission results. ODOs are also responsible for coordination
        with other AOC divisions, subordinate TACS units as necessary, and passing critical
        information to/from their respective ICCs. (e.g., ADWs, significant battle damage,
        unexpected changes, diverted aircraft, and airfield status).
        5.5.2.3.2. Dynamic Targeting Cell (DTC). The DTC directs execution of DTs and
        TSTs. The cell relies on a standard set of processes and tools to quickly coordinate
        across components while developing a targeting solution using the find, fix, track,
        target, engage, assess (F2T2EA) model. Depending on local COD procedures, this
        cell may also be used to assign new targets to ATO tasked missions that do not fall
        under dynamic or time sensitive guidelines. The cell typically consists of:
            5.5.2.3.2.1. DTC chief. (AFSC: 11/12/13B). The chief will evaluate all tracks of
            interest and recommend courses of action to SODO and COD chief.

        with missile defense training and is responsible to the SADO and CCO for
        information and recommendations concerning theater missile alerts, warning
        dissemination, and the evaluation of areas of theater missile activity/interest.
        Additionally, the team provides strike recommendations and/or tracks strike
        operations when enemy capabilities are activated, identified, and targeted for
        immobilization. The team monitors the status of active IAMD assets, coordinates
        with the SIDO team to determine expected enemy missile attacks, monitors the
        capability of the entire active IAMD force to engage enemy missiles attacking or
        expected to attack defended assets, and makes recommendations to the SADO for re-
        tasking of active IAMD assets. IAMD personnel also coordinate with global ballistic
        missile defense force representatives at higher and lower levels on long range threats
        which could impact other CCMDs operations.            A theater missile defense net
        (TMDN) may be established for voice warning. The IAMD cell must know and
        understand the theater air and missile defense framework and serve as the primary
        coordinator for the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC), and AADC as well as to

  3115.01B, Joint Data Network (JDN) Operation, the JDN is comprised of several digital data
  networks, each of which is optimized to enable improved situational awareness and
  commander’s decision cycle. JDN operations consist of the personnel and processes that
  provide the CTP to the JTF. Information included in the CTP directly supports the JTF’s
  assigned missions and is the JTF’s primary input to the CCDR’s COP. One of the primary
  systems supporting the CTP is the MTN. The JFACC’s and JAOC’s digital input to the
  MTN is managed by the IC team. IAW CJCSM 6120.01D Joint Multi Tactical Data link
  (TDL) Operating Procedures, an MTN should be reliable, survivable, flexible, interoperable,
  timely, and secure. The concept of joint combat operations is supported by the exchange of
  tactical information between participants on a real-time or near-real-time basis with TDLs.
  The exchange of real-time tactical information between C2 systems, weapon systems, and
  intelligence systems provides mutual support, allows coordinated action, and prevents
  interference between interfaced forces for the efficient and effective application of military
  force.

     current MTN to include, if tasked by the JDNO, planning, execution, management, and
     analysis. If tasked by the JTF, the AOC ICO, provided that they have met JICO
     requirements outlined in CJCSM 3115, may function as the Joint ICO (JICO), the senior
     element in the Multi-TDL architecture (MTA), or as a regional ICO (RICO), a secondary
     command element of the MTA. If designated the JICO, the AOC ICO may also designate
     subordinate RICO and sector ICOs (SICO) as required. (Note: The JICO will by default,
     delegate authority for control of Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corp interface
     operations to the applicable component RICO cell, if available.) RICOs also could be
     assigned specific geographic and/or force specific area(s) of interest. In addition, the
     ICO works closely with the C2 Planning Team in developing and updating of
     OPTASKLINK and TACOPDAT messages.

  INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE DIVISION (ISRD)

6.1. General. The ISR division provides the JFACC, JAOC, and subordinate units with
predictive and actionable intelligence, ISR operations, and targeting in a manner that, in part,
drives the air tasking cycle. A common threat and targeting picture is critical to planning and
executing theater-wide air, space, and cyberspace operations to accomplish JFACC objectives.
The ISR division provides the means by which the effects of these operations are measured. ISR
division personnel direct the AOC’s distributed and reach-back ISR processes in order to
conduct ISR strategy, intelligence preparation of the operational environment (IPOE), ISR
operations, target development, and assessment, which provides the context for understanding
the adversary's intentions and supports the achievement of predictive battlespace awareness
(PBA). PBA is the situational awareness needed to develop patterns of behavior, constraints,
and opportunities of geography, topography, cultures, environment, forces, and personalities that
allow us to predict, misdirect, and pre-empt our adversaries in order to successfully create effects
when and where we choose. This knowledge of the operational environment, in concert with C2,
enables the JFACC to anticipate future battlespace conditions, establish priorities, exploit
emerging opportunities, and act with a degree of speed and certainty not matched by our
adversaries. It is also essential that the ISR division provide continuous perspective to all
supported entities to include coordination and collaboration with the AFFOR/A2. This is critical
to ensure a consistent intelligence perspective is provided to all participants.
6.2. Major ISR Division Process Inputs. ISR division process inputs include other component
TNLs, JFC and JFACC guidance, JAOP, AOD, ATO, ACO, SPINS, ROE, LOAC, CCIRs,
JIPOE and other component IPOE products, TSA products, all-source intelligence reporting,
JTL, RTL, NSL, JIPTL, CRs, PED requirements, and sensor/platform availability.
6.3. Major IRSD Process Outputs. Major process outputs include an ISR synchronization
matrix, RSTA annex, CPCL, collection decks, PIRs, IPOE products, INTSUM, DISUM,
MISSUM, briefings, adversary OB, threat updates, electronic and automated target folders
(ETF/ATFs), target materials, air component TNL, integrated TNL, weaponeering solutions,
collateral damage estimates, STAR packages, mensurated aimpoints, BDAREPS, ISR
assessment reports, and assessment information requirements (AIR) inputs to operational
assessment.
6.4. ISRD Organization. The ISR division is led by the ISR Division Chief (CISR). It is
functionally aligned to fully integrate sensor, platform, and functional experts within the ISR
division core teams as well as in the other AOC divisions. This symmetry ensures consistency of
function and general alignment of responsibilities. For ISR division organizational breakdown
see Figure 6.1 ISR Division Organization, Functional Teams, and Major Processes.
   6.4.1. ISRD Core Teams. The ISR division has the following core teams: analysis,
   correlation, and fusion (ACF), targets/tactical assessment (TA), ISR operations, and PED
   management (Note: As the situation warrants, the CISR may choose to subordinate PED
   management under the ISR operations team as a cell instead of making it a separate team.
   Likewise request for information (RFI) management may be placed under unit support).
   These core teams provide intelligence products and services that support the entire AOC, the
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                            53


   JFACC, air component operational units, other components, and joint/coalition/PN/OGA
   forces. ISR division core teams must work closely with all AOC specialty and support teams,
   such as airspace management, space, weather, and IO. In addition to the ISR division core
   team’s two additional specialized ISR division elements are under the overall direction of the
   CISR. These elements are the imagery support element (ISE) and the national tactical
   integration (NTI) cell.
   6.4.2. ISRD Embedded Personnel. The ISR division embeds personnel within the strategy,
   combat plans, and combat operations divisions during all phases of operations to ensure that
   ISR experts can best perform strategy, planning, execution and assessment activities. These
   embedded personnel also have the responsibility to provide the ISR division information
   developed as a result of activities in their respective divisions to enable the ISR division to
   conduct more effective ISR operations. However, they work for the respective AOC division
   chief within whose division they are embedded.

     6.5.3.6. RDO/ISR Platform LNOs Support to Combat Operations Division. The
     RDO/ISR platform LNOs are assigned to the SIDO team and are responsible to the
     CCO/SIDO/SODO/ CPD/SD as appropriate, for the management of ISR assets (in
     coordination with ISR operations personnel) assigned or made available to the JFACC.
     For the purposes of this document, RDO refers to duty officers assigned to the COD and
     are the COD’s primary operations officers responsible for ISR ATO execution. ISR
     platform LNOs are focused on their particular weapon system and normally share time
     between the SD, CPD, COD, and ISR division. (Note: ISR platform LNOs are enablers
     and not part of the core crew structure of the AOC.)
        6.5.3.6.1. Know the details of each airborne ISR mission, such as associated C2, EW,
        SEAD, collection priority and intent for the mission, on-station times, off-station

                            AIR MOBILITY DIVISION (AMD)

7.1. General. In coordination with the DIRMOBFOR, the AMD plans, coordinates, tasks and
executes the theater air mobility mission. The DIRMOBFOR is responsible for integrating the
total air mobility effort for the COMAFFOR or JFAC and, in this capacity, provides direction to
the AMD to execute the air mobility mission. The Chief of AMD ensures the AMD works as an
effective division of the AOC in the air and space planning and execution process. The AMD
coordinates with the JFC movement requirements and control authority (e.g., Joint Movement
Center [JMC]), the theater Air Mobility Operations Control Center [AMOCC] (if established),
COMAFFOR A-4 division staff, and the AMC TACC.
   7.1.1. Global Mobility. The AMD will plan, coordinate, task and execute intra-theater
   airlift, aeromedical evacuation (AE) and air refueling (AR) missions. The AMD provides for
   integration and support of all air mobility missions. The AMD schedules intra-theater airlift
   requests in conjunction with the JFC airlift priorities through the deployment distribution and
   operations center (DDOC), if established, and the 618 AOC (TACC) for inter-theater airlift.
   Building partnership (BP) operations are another important consideration in global mobility
   operations. Specific personnel selection/qualification guidance for BP operations can be
   found in AMC Air Mobility System Building Partnerships Concept of Employment, v. 3.4, 2
   August 2010, and in the Concept of Employment - Institutionalizing Building Partnerships
   into Contingency Response Forces, 9 April 2010. The AMD will integrate and direct
   execution of theater-asssigned and United States Transportation command
   (USTRANSCOM)-assigned mobility forces operating in the AOR/joint operations area
   (JOA) in support of the JFC requirements/objectives. The AMD must be prepared to plan
   and direct air mobility missions into high threat environments (i.e., Chemical, Biological,
   radiological, Nuclear [CBRN], Integrated Air Defense Systems [IADS]).
   7.1.2. Contingencies. In contingencies, air mobility requirements peak during the
   deployment and build-up stage of the operation. As the contingency transitions into the
   sustainment phase, requirements decrease to a near-steady level. Once the redeployment
   stage begins, air mobility requirements will once again peak. The increased use of air
   mobility assets across the range of military operations also dictates the need for theater AOC
   AMD readiness. Therefore, the theater AOC AMD must be ready to quickly transition from
   normal to contingency operations at the very outset of a contingency response.
7.2. Major AMD Process Inputs. Inputs include USTRANSCOM, AMC, JMC/DDOC
validated requirements, timed phased force deployment data (TPFDD), JAOP, AOD, JIPTL,
ACP, AADP, ACO, ATO, SPINS, TACOPDAT, ROE/RUF, OPORD, and operational reports
(OPREP).
7.3. Major AMD Processes. The AMD chief and all team chiefs will establish effective
procedures for managing AMD activities within their span of control to include the following:
Establish and enforce procedures that ensure all personnel provide complete, accurate, properly
formatted, and timely inputs to the global decision support system (GDSS). Develop and manage
the battle rhythm sufficient to accomplish ATO/ACO development, operational assessment,
SPINS development, and special projects, as required.
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                               77


7.4. Major Process Outputs. Outputs include the airlift schedule, tanker schedule, air mobility
support schedule, SPINS, daily SITREPs to inform all higher headquarters and commanders of
air mobility activity in the AOR/JOA, after-action reports, lessons learned inputs, and airspace
control measure (ACM) requests (ACMREQ).
7.5. Organization. The AMD is led by the AMD chief and is normally organized into four
functionally oriented teams: airlift control team (ALCT), air refueling control team (ARCT), air
mobility control team (AMCT), and aeromedical evacuation control team (AECT). Team
composition (e.g., numbers, specialties, and skill levels) will normally be tailored to meet unique
mission requirements. See Figure 7.1 AMD Organization, Functional Teams, and Major
Processes.

Figure 7.1. AMD Organization, Functional Teams, and Major Processes




   7.5.1. Airlift Control Team (ALCT). The ALCT provides intra-theater airlift functional
   expertise to plan and coordinate intra-theater airlift operations in the AOR/JOA. Airlift
   planners within the ALCT are responsible for completing the airlift portion of the ATO by
   processing validated airlift requests received from the JMC/DDOC, opportune cargo, and
   merging them with forecast inter-theater airlift movements into the AOR/ JOA. The ALCT
   also ensures the integration of inter-theater air mobility missions with intra-theater air, space,
   and cyberspace operations planning. This includes air mobility integration and coordination
   of USTRANSCOM-assigned air mobility forces. Direct-delivery inter-theater air mobility
   missions, if required, will be coordinated with the AMD and planned/tasked by the 618 AOC
   (TACC). The ALCT coordinates with MAF Mobile C2 units (CRG/CRE/CRT) deployed
78                                          AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


  within the AOR for the purpose of identifying airfield capabilities and mobility support
  requirements. The ALCT must integrate its activities with the ARCT, AMCT, AECT, and
  specialty/support functions to the maximum extent possible to support the total air mobility
  effort. The ALCT will attach a planner to the SD, as required.
  7.5.2. Air Refueling Control Team (ARCT). The ARCT plans and tasks air refueling
  missions to support theater air, space, and cyberspace operations and coordinates air
  refueling planning, tasking, and scheduling to support an air bridge and/or global attack
  missions within the AOR/JOA. Based on JFC and JFACC guidance, theater-assigned tankers
  may also provide air-refueling support to inter-theater air, space, and cyberspace operations
  (e.g., fighter deployments, long range bomber strikes, etc.). The ARCT must ensure close
  coordination with the AMD, COD, and CPD on all aspects of the air refueling mission.
  Normally, inter-theater air refueling missions are planned by the 618 AOC (TACC);
  however, it is possible the ARCT could be tasked with this responsibility. For inter-theater
  operations, the ARCT may also coordinate aircraft location and redeployment of inter-theater
  tanker assets and fighter unit movements requiring tanker support. Tanker duty officers
  (TDOs) embedded in COD provide air-refueling expertise to the COD and monitor and
  evaluate how the air refueling mission contributes to/synergizes air operations in order to
  meet JFACC objectives. The ARCT will attach a planner to the SD, as required. Duties will
  include coordination of future intra-theater tanker requirements with the SD chief, COD
  chief, ARCT chief, and AMD chief. In addition, this function provides the operational
  assessment capability for combat support air refueling operations including data collection
  and trend analysis. The ARCT must integrate its activities with the ALCT, AMCT, AECT,
  and specialty/support functions to the maximum extent possible to support the total air
  mobility effort.
  7.5.3. Air Mobility Control Team (AMCT). The AMCT provides centralized control of all
  intra-theater airlift operations in the AOR/JOA. The AMCT directs or redirects, as required,
  air mobility forces in concert with air, space, and cyberspace operations forces to respond to
  requirements changes, higher priorities, or immediate execution limitations. The AMCT
  deconflicts all air mobility operations into, out of, and within the AOR/JOA. The AMCT
  maintains the execution process and communications connectivity for tasking, coordinating,
  and flight following with the AOC COD, subordinate air mobility units, and mission forces.
  The AMCT also coordinates with 618 AOC (TACC) to resolve problems and provide C2
  information on air mobility operations. The AMD will embed an airlift duty officer (ALDO)
  in the COD. The AMCT must integrate its activities with the ARCT, ALCT, AECT, and
  specialty/support functions to the maximum extent possible to support the total air mobility
  effort. AMCT will serves as liaison with MAF Mobile C2 units (CRG/CRE/CRT) deployed
  within the AOR. Communications should be established with CHOP’d and Non-CHOP’d
  assets for the purpose of coordinating airfield capabilities and mobility support requirements.
  7.5.4. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Control Team (AECT). The AECT is responsible
  for operational planning, scheduling and execution of intra-theater AE missions. The AECT
  advises and briefs the AMD chief and DIRMOBFOR on AE issues. The AECT provides
  command and control of all theater assigned/attached AE units/operations within the
  specified AOR/JOA and assists with inter-theater AE operations arriving, departing or
  transiting the AOR/JOA. The AECT receives validated patient movement requirements from
  the Patient Movement Requirements Center (PMRC) supporting the AOR/JOA. This could
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                        79


   be the GPMRC (Global), TPMRC (Theater), or JPMRC (Joint). The AECT Theater
   Aeromedical Evacuation System (TAES) manager will coordinate with theater medical
   planners and develop plans and strategies to determine appropriate force lay-down of AE
   ground forces and AE crews in support of joint patient movement operations. The AECT
   maintains secure and non-secure communications links with all AE elements, patient
   movement requirements centers (PMRCs), theater medical planners and the deployment
   distribution operations center (DDOC). The AECT should coordinate closely with the PRCC
   and joint personnel recovery center (JPRC) to establish/develop integrated AE support
   following PR operations. The AECT integrates its activities with the ARCT, AMCT, ALCT,
   and specialty/support functions to the maximum extent possible to support the total air
   mobility effort.

     7.6.5.16. Notify supporting PMRC when missions are scheduled to maintain patient ITV.
  7.6.6. Support Functions.
     7.6.6.1. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance. The AMD has ISR division
     personnel that are responsible for evaluating ISR information for its effect on air mobility
     planning, execution, and force protection. The AMD does not produce ISR information
     but uses ISR information and products developed by other ISR division functions within
     the AOC. This information is applied to the air mobility mission.                   Specific
     responsibilities include:
        7.6.6.1.1. Interface with other ISR functions within the AOC to ensure the most
        current information on surface operations is being linked to air, space, and cyberspace
        operations and the airspace structure.
        7.6.6.1.2. Coordinate and provide intelligence for planned or immediate air mobility

        7.6.6.1.6. Support deployed intelligence assets at CRG/CRE locations.
     7.6.6.2. Airspace Management. (AFSC: 11M/12M/13M). The AMD has organic
     airspace management personnel that coordinate air mobility airspace requests and issues
     with the AOC airspace managers to ensure air mobility airspace requests and issues are
     integrated into ATO, ACO, and ACP production and execution. Specific responsibilities
     include:
        7.6.6.2.1. Interface with AOC/theater airspace managers to obtain or deconflict AMD
        airspace requirements.
        7.6.6.2.2. Maintain current display of the theater operating locations, airspace
        structure, and ACMs as necessary to support air mobility operations.
        7.6.6.2.3. Integrate with intelligence, IO, and airlift tactics to create/adjust ACMs
        based on the threat and integrate ACM change requests with COD airspace

        airspace planning, and is compatible with AOC operations airspace structure.
     7.6.6.3. Reports, Briefs, and Knowledge Operations. (AFSC: 11M/12M). The reports,
     briefings, and knowledge operations personnel are responsible to the AMD chief for
     administrative functions and reports and briefings. Specific responsibilities include:
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                           85


        7.6.6.3.1. Prepare briefings for the DIRMOBFOR and AMD chief.
        7.6.6.3.2. Prepare and distribute reports, messages, schedules, and correspondence.
        7.6.6.3.3. Maintain read files, suspense control documents, classified/unclassified
        files, and publication files.
        7.6.6.3.4. Post briefings to the appropriate web site.
        7.6.6.3.5. Monitor information security requirements.
        7.6.6.3.6. Ensure proper handling, dissemination, storage, and destruction of
        classified material.
        7.6.6.3.7. Prepare lessons learned for after action reports.

        7.6.6.3.9. Coordinate with Communications Focal Point (CFP) on computer/software
        problems.
     7.6.6.4. AMD Communications and Computer Support. AMD communications and
     computer support works closely with the AMD chief to ensure all communications
     requirements are rapidly established and maintained. The AMD communications package
     will be exercise or contingency unique. Communications and information systems
     support to the AMD will be a team effort between deploying AMC communications and
     information systems elements and the in-place CFP function. Each situation can bring a
     different requirement. An AMD communications and computer support representative
     will ensure AMD requirements including interface with supporting commands, telephone
     lines and equipment, frequency availability, and site availability are made known to the
     AFFOR/A6, chief AOC communications team, AOC Commander and DIRMOBFOR.
     This includes assisting deployed elements with communications difficulties.
     7.6.6.5. AMD Information Operations Support. IO is integrated into the AOC within
     all divisions to include the AMD. The AMC IO personnel supporting the 618 AOC
     (TACC) will develop IO plans across the range of military operations for mobility
     mission under C2 of the 618 AOC (TACC). All theater IOTs and the 618 AOC (TACC)
     IOT should collaborate on all IO plans that affect mobility operations.

                                           Chapter 8

                           SPECIALTY/SUPPORT FUNCTIONS

8.1. General. The specialty/support functions provide the AOC with diverse capabilities to help
orchestrate theater air, space, and cyberspace operations power. Many of these capabilities are
provided to the AOC from agencies external to the AOC organization. It is crucial to the success
of the AOC that these capabilities are integrated into the air, space, cyberspace, and IO planning
and execution process to ensure the best use of available assets. The AFFOR staff coordinates
regularly with the AOC and often provides specialized expertise. Specialty/support functions are
listed in the following paragraphs.
8.2. Component Liaisons. Component liaisons work for their respective component
commanders and with the JFACC and staff. Each component normally provides liaison elements
(e.g., BCD, SOLE, NALE, MARLE, etc.) that work within the AOC. These liaison elements
consist of experienced warfare specialists who provide component planning and tasking
expertise and coordination capabilities. They help integrate and coordinate their component’s
participation in joint air, space, and cyberspace operations (see JP 3-30, Command and Control
for Joint Operations). The USAF component may require other liaison augmentation to support
AOC functions such as Coast Guard, space forces, DIA, NSA, CIA, USAF Intelligence,
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO),
and FAA in various operational and support areas.
   8.2.1. Battlefield Coordination Detachment (BCD). The BCD supports the integration of
   air, space, and cyberspace operations with ground maneuver. BCD personnel are integrated
   into AOC divisions to support planning, operations, air defense, intelligence, airlift/logistics,
   airspace control, and communications. In particular, the BCD coordinates ground force
   priorities, requests, and items of interest. One of the BCD’s most important functions is to
   coordinate boundary line and fire support coordination line (FSCL) changes and timing. The
   BCD brings ground order of battle (GOB) (friendly and enemy) situational awareness and
   expertise into the AOC and will normally brief the ground situation/intelligence update. The
   BCD may also provide current ground situation inputs to AOC teams for incorporation into
   daily briefings and intelligence summaries.
   8.2.2. Air and Missile Defense Commander (AAMDC). The AAMDC is normally under
   the OPCON of the ARFOR commander or joint forces land component commander
   (JFLCC). When directed by the JFC, AAMDC assets may be placed in direct support of the
   JFACC/AADC as appropriate. The roles of the commanding general of the AAMDC are
   Senior Army ADA commander, theater Army air and missile defense coordinator
   (TAAMDCOORD), and deputy area air defense commander (DAADC). Coordination and
   liaison functions between all three are essential to effective air and missile defense operations
   within a given theater. The AAMDC and AOC intelligence personnel build a collaborative
   TAMD IPB, which serves as the basis for JTAMD strategies and plans. The AAMDC (attack
   operations section in coordination with the intelligence section) submits TM target
   nominations directly to the AOC for inclusion as JFACC nominated targets. The AAMDC
   also sends a robust LNO team (active defense, intelligence, and attack operations personnel)
   to support the JFACC, AADC, and DAADC requirements and may deploy the AAMDC
   TOC (Main) to the JFACC, AADC location. As the senior Army air defense element at the
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                            87


  AADC’s location, the AAMDC LNO team serves as the primary interface at the AOC for all
  land-based active air defense.
  8.2.3. Naval and Amphibious Liaison Element. NALE personnel from the maritime
  components support the JAOC in integrating naval air, naval fires, and amphibious
  operations into theater air operations and monitor and interpret the maritime battle situation
  for the AOC.
  8.2.4. Marine Liaison Element (MARLE). The MARLE represents the Commander,
  Marine Corps Forces (COMMARFOR) and his associated Aviation Combat Element
  Commander. The MARLEs will support the JFACC in integrating Marine Air-Ground Task
  Force (MAGTF) fires, maneuver, and Marine air into the theater campaign and supporting
  JAOP. This team will be well versed in the MAGTF Commander’s guidance, intentions,
  schemes of maneuver, and direct support aviation plan.
  8.2.5. Special Operations Liaison Element (SOLE). The Joint Forces Special Operations
  Component Commander (JFSOCC) provides a SOLE to the JFACC to coordinate and
  integrate SOF activities in the entire battlespace. This joint SOLE is comprised of
  representatives from SOF aviation, intelligence, airspace, logistics, Air Force STTs, Army
  Special Forces, Navy Sea-Air Land Teams (SEAL) and Marine Special Operations Forces, as
  required. Depending upon command structure agreements, the SOLE may or may not
  represent coalition or allied SOF. SOLE personnel coordinate, integrate and synchronize
  with various AOC functional areas to ensure that all SOF targets, SOF teams, and SOF air
  tasks and/or missions are deconflicted, properly integrated, and coordinated during planning
  and execution phases. The prevention of fratricide is a critical product of the SOLE’s efforts.
     8.2.5.1. Specific SOLE functions include, but are not limited to, inputs into the JFACC
     strategy development; inputs into the ATO development; inputs into the ACO
     development; real-time mission support coordination with the Joint Special Operations
     Air Component Commander (JSOACC) with special emphasis on airspace deconfliction;
     operational and intelligence inputs into the targeting process; and close coordination with
     the RCC/JPRC.
     8.2.5.2. As the JFSOCC and the JFACC share a common environment throughout the
     entire battlespace, it is imperative that SOF aviation and surface forces are integrated into
     joint air, space, and cyberspace operations planning and execution to prevent fratricide,
     duplication of effort, and conflict. Active SOLE participation in the development of air,
     space, and cyberspace operations strategy and the supporting plans to the theater
     campaign plan ensures that SOF efforts will, in fact, be a force multiplier for the theater
     campaign plan.
     8.2.5.3. SOF normally pursues SOF-unique objectives, which prepare, shape or enhance
     broader JFC objectives, they may be tasked to operate in support of conventional
     objectives or require conventional support of their objectives.
     8.2.5.4. Additionally, SOLE has the following responsibilities: provide inputs and
     guidance to the IO team; act as the focal point for raising JFACC concerns or MISO
     objective/tasking to the JFC for consideration, planning, and execution; provide support
     to the IO team MISO effort to synchronize and deconflict MISO into the air, space, and
 88                                          AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


       cyberspace operations campaign (e.g., leaflet drops, message broadcasts, and aircraft
       mission are included into the ATO, etc.).
   8.2.6. Coalition/Allied Liaison Officers. LNOs representing coalition/allied surface forces
   may improve AOC situational awareness regarding the disposition of friendly forces,
   especially when those forces do not have a mature TACS. They are also essential for unity of
   effort for coalition air defense operations and airspace deconfliction. When teamed with
   linguists, they can help overcome language barriers with remote allied/coalition forces. In
   force projection scenarios into an immature theater, the AOC Commander must anticipate the
   need for LNOs and actively seek them out via the JFC staff, in-country military group, staff
   country team, or direct contact with coalition forces, if necessary (see JP 3-0, Doctrine for
   Joint Operations).
8.3. Combat Reports Cell. The combat reports cell reports directly to the COD chief for
guidance and direction. The manning of the combat reports cell is contingent upon the level of
operations. Unless the responsibility is assigned to knowledge operations personnel elsewhere in
the AOC, combat reports personnel are the focal point for collection of current operations
information provided to the AOC by all elements of the TACS and employed forces. Required
reports address the operational status of forces, weapons, and control system equipment
employed by an AOC. Reports cell personnel are responsible for collection and consolidation of
COD inputs to the JFACC update briefing and the daily situation report (SITREP). Must be
knowledgeable on USMTF formats and understand how to complete additional reports such as
OPTASKs, OPREPS, NBC reports, and SARREQs. Personnel are required to access and
manipulate sortie data within the TBMCS database; parse the ATO; coordinate and obtain results
of flying operations from other agencies within the AOC; establish computer information
pipeline requirements (NIPRNET, SIPRNET, UNCLAS e-mail, Coalition LAN, TBMCS, etc.);
post JFACC briefings to the SIPRNET; and perform any other duties assigned by the JFACC.
8.4. Common Tactical Picture (CTP) Management Cell. Per CJCSM 3115.0B, Joint Data
Network (JDN) Operations, the JDN is comprised of several digital data networks, each of which
is optimized to enable improved situation awareness and commander’s decision cycle. SA is
discerned through the generation and display of a CTP within the JTF headquarters, shared with
the JTF’s component commanders, and forwarded to the CCDR as an input to the COP.
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                         89


Figure 8.1. JTF JDN Overview




Figure 8.1. JTF JDN Overview depicts the information exchanges in a single theater of
operations among the JTF commander and component commanders for maritime, air/space, land,
and special operations forces (SOF) to form the CTP. Each component commander is responsible
for the development of his or her tactical picture. The depicted CTP is a distributed data
processing and exchange environment for developing and displaying a dynamic operational
picture of the CCDR’s AOR. The components or JTF CTP provides a graphical representation
of the operational environment for a single operation or JTF within a CCDR’s AOR. The CTP
provides planning applications and theater-generated overlays and projections such as
environmental, battle plans, force position projections that may include location of enemy,
friendly, and neutral forces, assets, and reference points. The CTP displays accurate, relevant
tactical data and meteorological information that integrates information from multiple
operational environment components. CTP data comes from the service’s data links, sensors,
UAVs, ISR platforms, satellites and other sources that provide a current depiction of the
operational environment. CTP management is a continuous process of maintaining an accurate
and current picture of the operational environment. This continuous process encompasses
configuring and maintaining related global command and control system (GCCS) CTP systems,
establishing and managing communications and messaging services, and ensuring filters are set
for the exchange of data. While the CTP function is at the AOC the COP function normally
resides at the JTF level and is part of the JDN cell.
   8.4.1. The AOC Component JDNO Equivalent (CJE). (AFSC: 13B/17D). The AOC CJE
   manager works for COD chief and receives inputs from intelligence, operations, and
   communications teams to ensure the JFACC’s CTP architecture is established properly.
   IAW JDN published OPSTASKCOP and other higher headquarter guidance, the CJE
   provides an accurate and consolidated air picture to all AOC divisions as well as the JFACC.
   The AOC CJE is also responsible for establishing settings (per guidance) for the tactical
 90                                           AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


   management system (TMS), universal communications processor (UCP), and filters at
   appropriate levels of detail and coordinating with COP Correlation Sites (CCS) and the
   CCMD JDN cell. Additionally, the CJE sets up and manages the AOC GCCS architecture
   and provides CTP SME support to AOC personnel; works with WSM and other AOC staff
   members to ensure feeds, tasked sensors, and reporting systems support AOC CTP
   requirements; ensures all CTP feeds correlate together to provide an accurate display of the
   battle space; ensure CTP data is distributed to subordinate TACS elements equipped with the
   appropriate GCCS client software; manage CTP permissions, monitor and resolve
   connectivity and interoperability issues; and configure the pseudo identification feature
   (PIF), arbitrary ELINT notation (AEN), and joint unit (JUNIT) tables as required.
   8.4.2. CTP Track Manager. (AFSC: 1C5/1NX). CTP track managers are responsible to the
   CJE. CTP track managers utilize the GCCS-USAF/J integrated communication system
   framework (ICSF) client for displaying and manipulating the AOC CTP air picture and are
   required to maintain constant vigilance of the air picture to ensure tracks are processed and
   updated in a timely manner. CTP track managers collect, index, and disseminate CTP track
   data and other related information throughout the AOC. This function must resolve naming
   conflicts using the processes of correlation (matching tracks plotted on the tactical display
   with the contacts they represent) and fusion (integrating correlated track data with amplifying
   information) on the CTP. Manager creates, edits, deletes, merges, and monitors tracks, track
   groups, overlays, and routes. Cell resolves CTP track conflicts and anomalies (i.e. dual
   designations, duplicate tracks, false targets, runway tracks, identification, and category
   conflicts) and inputs appropriate track amplifications as required. Additionally, CTP track
   manager works closely with interface control team, ISR team, C-ACT, WSM, and CM, to
   ensure compliance with OPTASK COP parameters, maintenance of intelligence feeds, and
   correlation of the ATO and other messages into the air picture displayed on the CTP. CTP
   management of intelligence tracks is normally performed by intelligence personnel assigned
   to the SIDO team on the COD floor. This position would support the CJE for intelligence
   CTP management duties.
   8.4.3. CTP Management Cell Processes:
       8.4.3.1. Manage AOC CTP architecture.
       8.4.3.2. Manage GCCS CTP Track data.
       8.4.3.3. Implement and manage CTP track data filters.
       8.4.3.4. Create and manage CTP communication channels.
       8.4.3.5. Correlate ATO with CTP air picture.
       8.4.3.6. Maintain a complete, timely, and accurate CTP.
       8.4.3.7. Directs/supervises the resolution of track data anomalies (i.e., dual designations,
       duplicate tracks, false targets, runaway tracks, identification, and category conflicts).
       8.4.3.8. Make inputs to the OPTASK COP.
8.5. Airspace Management Team. (AFSC: 13, 1C1, 1C5). The goal of the Airspace
management team (AMT) is to enhance air, land, maritime and SOF components’ effectiveness
in accomplishing the JFC’s objectives, while decreasing the potential for fratricide. This is
accomplished by effectively coordinating, integrating and de-conflicting airspace and procedures
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                          91

level. The IOT provides a forward presence with reach back capability and is provided
intelligence support from the ISR division. USAF operational-level application of IO consists of
three-core operational elements: electronic warfare operations (EWO), network warfare
operations (NWO) and influence operations (IFO). The purpose of these elements is to fully
integrate IO effects in support of national and theater objectives to produce effects across the full
spectrum of conflict and throughout all phases of operations. Per AFDD 3-13, Information
Operations: “The operational activities of electronic warfare operations are Electronic Attack,
Electronic Protection, and Electronic Warfare Support.” “The operational activities of network
warfare operations are Network Attack (Net-A), Network Defense (Net-D) and Network Warfare
Support (NWS).” “The operational activities of influence operations are Military Information
Support Operations (MISO), military deception (MILDEC), operations security (OPSEC),
counterintelligence (CI) operations, Public Affairs (PA) and counterpropaganda operations.”
Counterintelligence operations are conducted via AFOSI support to the IOT, and in concert with
the C-NAF PA. Lastly, the IOT will ensure their plans and support are in line with joint IO
operations across the JAO through both embed LNOs, as necessary, and direct liaison with joint
service command centers.

8.8. Judge Advocate (JA). (AFSC: 51J). The role of JAs in an AOC is to provide legal
expertise and resources in support of the JFACC, each of the five AOC divisions, as well as
specialty and support functions within the AOC. The size and nature of the air, space, and
cyberspace operations, the tempo, and the number of processes in use by the AOC will assist in
determining the number of JAs assigned to support an AOC.
   8.8.1. In order to advise the JFACC, a JA will attend the major briefings or decision
   meetings attended by the JFACC. The JAs assigned to the JFACC staff will provide advice
   on, responsibilities under international, foreign, and domestic law as well as HHQ guidance,
   LOAC, and ROE/RUF.
   8.8.2. JAs advising the SD will ensure that all proposed strategy is consistent with
   international law (which includes the LOAC), domestic law, ROE/RUFs, orders from
   superior headquarters, and any other specific guidance or constraints specified by the JFC,
   other superior commanders, or the JFACC. The JAs advising this division will serve as the
   principal assistants in the process of drafting requests for supplemental ROE/RUF and
   reviewing ROE/RUF approved by the CCDR or other higher echelons of command.
   ROE/RUF inputs are generated with representatives from all of the major weapon systems,
   SOF, IO, Space, ISR division, Legal, all the Services Liaisons, and others designated by the
   JFACC. JAs may, when appropriate, brief ROE/RUF or assist others who brief ROE/RUF.
   They may also lead or assist the effort to train personnel in ROE/RUF.
   8.8.3. JAs advising the CPD will ensure a thorough legal analysis is conducted for selected
   targets, weaponeering, assignment of forces, and in some circumstances they will work
   closely with the ISR division targets analysts, TET chief, and MAAP chief in reviewing the
   choice of tactics for certain sensitive targets. This requires JAs to participate in the
   development of the JIPTL and MAAP throughout the ATO cycle. The JA assigned to CPD
   will also be responsible for working with the C2 plans chief to develop the ROE/RUF
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                             99


   chapter for the SPINS. The JA assigned to the SD or CPD also provides support to the STO
   team as needed.
   8.8.4. JAs advising the COD will provide legal counsel on all matters within the purview of
   that division, including insuring LOAC and ROE/RUF compliance for dynamic targeting,
   CSAR actions, interpreting SPINS and ROE/RUF, and addressing other emergent legal
   issues that arise during the execution of the current ATO.
   8.8.5. JAs advising the ISR division will provide legal counsel on all matters within the
   purview of that division, including the currency of information about a target and its location
   with respect to non-military structures and personnel, the weaponeering or weapon system
   being used, the likelihood of disproportionate collateral damage, and ROE limitations and
   restrictions.
   8.8.6. JAs advising the AMD will provide legal counsel on all matters within the purview of
   that division including international agreements affecting landing rights, over-flights,
   sovereignty, taxes, customs, aircraft accidents, and civil reserve air fleet (CRAF). Note these
   issues need to be coordinated with the JFACC/JA staff.
8.9. Wx Specialty Team (WST). Administratively assigned to the COD, the WST is a
horizontally cross-cutting capability integrated into all five AOC divisions to enable ATO
mission planning and execution. The composition and size of the WST will be dependent on the
size and scope of operations. The WST provides timely notification of METOC impacts
affecting launch and recovery bases, active orbits/tracks, routes of flight, and other areas of
operations as directed by the COD chief. METOC refers to the whole range of atmospheric
(wx), oceanographic, and space environment phenomena.
   8.9.1. Wx Specialty Team Chief. (AFSC: 15W). The WST chief is responsible for
   integrating METOC and METOC effects information into the overall AOC process.
   Information provided by the WST chief, in general, consists of daily briefings to the AOC
   and JFACC staff, with updates as required, on significant METOC impacts to strategic and
   operational-level planning and execution. The WST chief also defines requirements for
   reach-back support from the appropriate METOC organization.
   8.9.2. Strategy Division Support. The WST should be immersed in strategic planning from
   the outset to gain a complete understanding of JFACC intentions in meeting JFC objectives
   and to ensure climatological and current METOC conditions are considered in the forming of
   strategy. The WST uses medium to long range forecasts and climatological information to
   identify potential environmental impacts to enemy and friendly operations. During
   development of the joint air estimate, JAOP, and branch and sequel plans, the strategy plans
   team will use meteorological information to mitigate impacts to friendly forces while
   capitalizing on advantages due to asymmetric environmental effects on enemy capabilities.
   Additionally, the WST should focus the strategy guidance team on METOC conditions in the
   48-72 hour timeframe that could degrade friendly force capabilities to find, fix, track, target,
   engage, and assess (F2T2EA) potential targets.
   8.9.3. Combat Plans Division Support. The WST will provide medium to near term
   METOC information to the MAAP and TET teams to support all aspects of mission
   planning, including target area wx effects information, predictions of METOC impacts on
   PGM effectiveness, and METOC impacts to ISR sensors. Wx-effects decision aids, including
 100                                          AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


   electro-optical and space wx effects guidance, will be provided for determination of timing as
   well as weapons planned for use in the MAAP. Properly integrated, wx operations play a key
   role, especially during development of the MAAP. The WST should highlight METOC
   conditions in the next 48 hours that could degrade friendly force F2T2EA capabilities
   regarding potential targets. These forecasts provide the TET and MAAP team an opportunity
   to adjust the timing of missions as necessary. In addition, the MAAP team can exploit target
   wx information and METOC impacts to sensors, weapons, weapons systems, and platforms
   to modify weapons/sensor configurations and system mixes. By optimally pairing weapons
   systems and platforms to targets based on METOC conditions, the MAAP team can
   maximize the probability of achieving desired effects.
   8.9.4. Combat Operations Division Support. The WST will support all aspects of mission
   execution including DTs/TSTs and PR missions, the BCD, and other emerging targeting
   decisions.     The      WST       will     maintain    situational      awareness      of    the
   meteorological/oceanographic/solar conditions; provide timely notification of wx elements
   affecting launch and recovery bases, active orbits/tracks, route of flight, and other operations
   or areas as directed by the CCO. To increase mission effectiveness, the WST must inject
   relevant, accurate wx and space environment information as early as possible into the daily
   ATO process, enabling decision-makers to mitigate risks and optimize the pairing of
   capabilities to targets. The WST must also be responsive to the need for real-time or near
   real-time forecasts in support to dynamic retargeting, TSTs, combat search and rescue
   operations, ISR collection activities, and other emerging requirements.
   8.9.5. ISR Division Support. The WST will provide METOC information and predicted
   impacts on ISR sensors, and other friendly and enemy assets and activities. The WST will
   collect any wx information/imagery available from hostile areas or other areas where routine
   wx data is unavailable. To support ISR operations effectively, the WST must have access to
   detailed ISR mission profiles and collaborate with appropriate analysts to identify the
   probable METOC sensitivities of enemy capabilities. During IPOE, analysts should leverage
   METOC information to help determine likely enemy courses of action, but more importantly,
   to highlight instances in which enemy capabilities are degraded more than friendly
   capabilities (i.e., asymmetrically), offering friendly force commanders an exploitable
   advantage. The ISR division should employ ISR sensor/system capabilities to provide non-
   traditional collection of wx information in data-sparse and data-denied areas. Wx forces
   leverage this information to formulate a more accurate depiction of current and predicted wx
   conditions in the battlespace, enhancing support to the joint force.
   8.9.6. Air Mobility Division Support. The WST will provide the AMD with tailored
   information on any METOC impacts to air mobility operations. This should include impacts
   to theater air mobility operations such as transport, air refueling, paradrop, and medical
   evacuation. In particular, the WST delivers strategic and operational level environmental
   impacts on areas of departure and recovery bases (including alternates), landing and drop
   zones, and air refueling routes throughout the designated AOR. The WST should keep the
   AMD staff and DIRMOBFOR apprised at all times of significant METOC impacts to
   mobility operations.
8.10. Combat Support Team (CST). The CST is the AOC’s focal point for all Combat
Support (CS) related issues affecting the AOC’s ability to plan and execute combat air power.
When conducting joint operations, combat support information affecting support and
AFI13-1AOCV3_AMCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                            101


sustainment of other services or coalition air forces will be best provided to the CST by service
or coalition logisticians. As such all effort should be made to develop a contingency (or standing)
JMD with the other services that can be filled in a timely manner. During strategy development
and other planning processes, the AFFOR staff will provide the CST assessments of potential
impact to bed down decisions, impacts of time phased force and deployment data (TPFDD), and
feasibility and forces closure estimates. As a minimum, the CST is comprised of aircraft
maintenance, logistics readiness, and a munitions officer or NCO but can be expanded with
representation from other AFFOR staff directorates as required. The CST gives the AOC an on-
site team with a broad range of combat support expertise as well as a direct line of
communication to the combat support expertise on the AFFOR staff. The CST is assigned to the
AFFOR staff and reports directly to the AFFOR/A4. The CST is led by a field grade combat
support officer familiar with AOC processes and the broad range of combat support operations
that may impact AOC processes and ATO execution.
8.11. Knowledge Operations (KO) Team. The C-NAF organization is responsible for
establishing an effective KO structure and flow strategy throughout the air and space component.
This strategy is designed to meet the entire C-NAF and subordinate organizations’ needs for
seamless, relevant and timely information, while optimizing the use of information infrastructure
resources. The AOC KO support team is a sub-element of the C-NAF KO organization. The
goal of KO is providing relevant, precise, accurate, timely, usable, and complete information that
supports the commander in obtaining situational awareness and an understanding that allows him
to make timely and effective decisions faster than the adversary can react, or in a non-combat
situation, at a tempo that allows the force to shape the situation or react to changes and
accomplish the mission.
   8.11.1. General. According to AFDD 3-13, Information Operations, information is a
   weapon and a target. The intent is to treat information as an asset, just like any other weapon
   or tool of warfare. It can be used to control forces and deliver precise effects. Command and
   control of information supports the commander in three main areas: achieving situational
   awareness/ understanding, making decisions, and communicating execution information to
   implement those decisions. In that context, everyone in the AOC is an information manager
   with an inherent responsibility to acquire, assess, reason, question, correlate, and disseminate
   quality information to other users, and to maintain and protect it throughout its life cycle.
   8.11.2. Supported and Supporting Division/Team Relationships. The division/team
   chiefs, information and information system users have a shared, corporate responsibility with
   the KO support team for the effectiveness and efficiency of the KO processes supporting
   AOC operations.
   8.11.3. Knowledge Operations Support Team. The KO Support Team is responsible for
   the overall health of the KO processes, designing/executing the air component’s information
   flow strategy, and optimizing the use of the information infrastructure to support the
   commander’s needs for relevant and timely information. KO processes include the creation,
   collection and control, dissemination, storage and retrieval, protection and destruction of
   information, electronic and paper, classified and unclassified. The KO support team is
   normally led by a KM officer and divided into two separate elements: AOC leadership KO,
   division and specialty/support team KO. Additionally these elements support the air, space,
   cyberspace, IO component information management board (ACIMB). Duties performed in
   each element may vary by AOC depending on the AOC mission, size, and how they choose

  to organize and assign responsibilities. For example, AOC KO may compile all briefings and
  reports or have the KO managers in the divisions compile the ones their divisions are
  responsible for.
      8.11.3.1. AOC/KO Officer. The AOC/KO Officer is directly responsible to the AOC
      Commander, with AFFOR/A6 functional oversight and support, for coordinating the
      flow and management of the information throughout the AOC. The AOC KO team is
      normally composed of the KO officer and/or superintendent and may include one or more
      KO managers. The AOC Commander in coordination with the AFFOR/A6 makes the
      final decision on the composition of the AOC KO team.
      8.11.3.2. Division and Specialty/Support KO Team. Team personnel are directly
      responsible to the division and specialty/support team chiefs they are supporting. They
      are responsible for assuring that the supported division/specialty/support team is
      complying with the KO plan. Specialty/Support team KO personnel serving in functional
      specific positions such as AOC special security office, etc. are also responsible to their
      team for performing KO duties.
      8.11.3.3. KO Superintendent. (AFSC: 3D071). Superintendant duties include but not

8.12. Personnel Rescue Coordination Cell (PRCC). The PRCC plans, coordinates, and
directs the execution of combat search and rescue (CSAR) missions for theater JFACC. The
PRCC may vary in size and composition and is organized based upon mission requirements.
Duties involve coordinating the five PR execution tasks of reporting, locating, supporting,
recovering, and reintegrating isolated personnel. Isolated personnel are, in effect, fleeting targets
of critical value—available capabilities and assets must be expeditiously coordinated and
employed to effect successful recoveries. The JFACC, through the AOC and PRCC, exercises
operational control (OPCON) of theater-assigned USAF CSAR assets and units. The PRCC is
typically composed of a director, duty officers, planners, controllers, and other specialists who
are integrated with or closely work with all five AOC divisions and reports to AOC Commander.
For PRCC organizational techniques, responsibilities, processes, and guidance see AFI 13-208,
PRCC Organization and Training.
8.13. Special Technical Operations (STO) Team. The STO team is responsible for ensuring
proper integration of special technical capabilities with conventional operations to meet JFC and
JFACC objectives as defined in the JAOP. The STO reports to the Chief COD. The STO
planning process mirrors the conventional planning process, and the capabilities presented
through the STO process should be treated no differently than any other capability except for
their special security requirements. The STO Team does not "own" any AOC process but
supports all processes across the AOC. Consequently, the team relies on collaboration with STO
briefed individuals in the AOC divisions and teams to develop the separate but necessary
classified concepts, briefings, legal reviews and documents for strategy, guidance, targeting,
apportionment, plans, and operations.
   8.13.1. STO Processes. All STO Specialty Team members should review the following
   classified publications for integrated joint special technical operations (IJSTO) policies,
   guidance, instructions, and formats: CJCSI 3120.08 Series, IJSTO (U); CJCSM 3122.07
   Series, IJSTO supplement to joint operation planning and execution system (JOPES) Volume
   I (planning policies and procedures) (U); CJCSM 3122.08 Series, IJSTO supplement to
   JOPES (Volume II) planning formats and guidance (U), and CJCSI 3110.15 Series,
   supplemental instruction to the joint strategic capabilities plan FY XXXX (JSCP FY XXXX):
   IJSTO (U). These instructions and manuals are available to the STO Specialty Team via the
   planning and decision aid system (PDAS).
   8.13.2. Special Technical Operations Responsibilities.
       8.13.2.1. The STO team facilitates the development of STO and advanced program
       supplements to the JAOP, AOD, MAAP, etc. The STO team will facilitate coordination
       for planners and other specialty teams/special mission units to provide additional
       assistance to the planner. For example: As the AOD and AOD supplement are
       developed by the SD, the STO team makes available resources and facilities to the
       strategy representatives in obtaining the information necessary to complete the AOD
       supplement and preparation of the AOD decision brief.

  which should be assigned to the AOC on a daily basis. As contingencies evolve, additional
  STO manning may be required. Augmentation from other service components and/or
  weapon system SMEs should be anticipated.
      8.13.3.1. AOC STO Chief: The AOC STO Chief’s duties are described in the CJCSI
      3120.08 series. This position is responsible for facilitation of all STO security and
      advanced program activities in the AOC and is normally administratively assigned to the
      SD Chief. The AOC STO Chief’s primary focus is to ensure that all AOC divisions and
      teams are properly supported so that sensitive military capabilities are appropriately
      integrated into Joint strategy, plans, and operations. Additionally, the AOC STO Chief
      coordinates with other components and functional JFC STO teams to synchronize plans
      and operations. This coordination includes requesting reach back support, requesting
      additional capabilities, and obtaining necessary authorities to deploy and employ STO
      capabilities.
      8.13.3.2. STO Intelligence Officer. The STO intelligence officer is responsible for
      working with other AOC Divisions to coordinate STO specific collection plan

8.14. Regional Air Movements Control Center (RAMCC). As a specialty team reporting to
the AOC/CC, the RAMCC serves two specific functions with regard to assisting the
JFACC/CFACC in the role of ACA. The first role of the RAMCC is to provide airspace control
when there is an inadequate air traffic control infrastructure. In this capacity, the RAMCC uses
procedural measures to deconflict air traffic transiting the AOR. The second role of the RAMCC
is to provide contingency airflow management, of civilian and military air traffic, at designated
airfields within the AOR. Accomplished through the use of arrival and departure slot times, this
ensures interagency coordination during planning and execution to prevent exceeding airfield
capabilities with respect to parking and support.
   8.14.1. RAMCC Organization.
       8.14.1.1. Long Range Plans. Focusing on operations beyond 24 hours, the Long Rang
       Plans Section coordinates with the air space planners to develop airspace requirements,
       procedures for deconfliction and issues slot times to aircrew, planners and C2 agencies.
       8.14.1.2. Current Operations. Focusing on plan as established by Long Range Plans
       Section, the Current Operations Section focuses on making mission adjustments as
       required to maximize throughput and maintain systemic velocity.
       8.14.1.3. Airfield Operations. Liaising with airfield managers and C2 elements, Airfield
       Operations identifies capabilities such as parking and working MOGs that have a direct
       impact airflow planning and executions. Capabilities are coordinated with Long Range
       Plans and Current Operations for the purpose of planning and execution.
       8.14.1.4. Mission Support. Mission support Section provides communications and
       administrative support for the RAMCC. This is of particular need when the RAMCC is
       not colocated with the AOC.
   8.14.2. Duties and Responsibilities.

development and coordination of communication courses of action and plans. It is scaled to fit
the size of the operation, is integrated across all five divisions, and attends C/JFACC and other
meetings as required. The CIC is a focused, integrated cell generating information to support
AOC leadership, normally administratively assigned to the AOC Direcror, with the added benefit
of providing information useful to AOC and JFC Information Operations and Public Affairs
teams. It will assist the C/JFACC in developing rapid, accurate, fact based responses to
significant ATO events. The cell blends elements from the IO Team, JA, ISR division, PA and
others as required and must be prepared to contend with various high-profile operational
scenarios. The CIC develops public information courses of action (COAs) to meet the
C/JFACC's intent, to defend public trust and support, improve force morale and readiness, and
influence/deter global adversaries. In the information age, the timely release of truthful
information (good or bad news) impacts public knowledge and perception of USAF operations
and capabilities. Information generated by the cell supports AOC leadership decision making and
can also be used to help mitigate C/JFACC strategic exposure to propaganda and to maximize
domestic and international support for coalition/PN/OGA air efforts.
8.16. Director of Space Forces (DIRSPACEFOR). The DIRSPACEFOR is the senior space
advisor to the JFACC with broad space expertise, theater familiarity, and who provides advice on
the planning, executing, and assessing of USAF space operations. The DIRSPACEFOR
facilitates coordination, integration, and staffing activities on behalf of the JFACC to include
providing support for joint space operations to the SCA. The JFACC can also direct the
DIRSPACEFOR to sit on the special staff of the SCA to provide advice on Air Force space
forces and capabilities. When the JFACC is designated the SCA, the DIRSPACEFOR will
typically accomplish the day-to-day duties assigned to the SCA.
8.17. AOC COMMUNICATIONS TEAM (ACT)
   8.17.1. General. The ACT is part of an Air and Space Communications Squadron which is
   either directly under the AFFOR/A6 or a supporting group/squadron for day to day
   management. This team provides direct communications support to the AOC Commander to
   ensure all AOC systems including all communications systems are integrated and operating
   properly. The ACT integrates AOC systems with other USAF, DOD, joint, coalition, PN and
   OGA systems. The ACT is managed by the chief, AOC Communications Team (C-ACT).
   The C-ACT works on a daily basis with the AOC configuration manager (CM) and the
   weapons system manager (WSM) to ensure the AOC networks and systems are configuration
   managed IAW guidance provided by the AOC WS and the local site change review board
   (CRB), configuration management plan (CMP), and/or System Management Board (SMB).
   The ACT is composed of five functions: the communications focal point (CFP), AOC
   networks control, C2 systems, data links, and plans and programs. Collectively, the
   functions provide AOC-unique communications services and tools for planning, generation,
