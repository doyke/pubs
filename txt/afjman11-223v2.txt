                             SINGLE-POINT RIGGING PROCEDURES


                                                      PREFACE

  This manual is one of a series of manuals for aviation and ground personnel who perform helicopter sling load
missions ashore or aboard ship. Other manuals in this series are FM 10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/
AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A and FM 55-450-5/FMFRP 5-31, VOL III/NWP 42-1,VOL III/
AFR 50-16, VOL III/COMDTINST M13482.4.

   These manuals are a coordinated effort of the US Army, US Marine Corps, US Navy, US Air Force, and US
Coast Guard. All services participate in the sling load certification program begun by the Army in 1984. These
manuals include standardized rigging procedures and other information from that program. Chapters 2 through 14
contain rigging procedures for single-point loads which have been certified for sling load. Chapters 15 through 24
contain rigging procedures which have not been certified but have demonstrated acceptable static lift and flight
characteristics during a flight test.

   Efforts were made to standardize ground crew and hookup procedures and terminology. Where service-unique
requirements apply to an entire chapter or body of text, the service initials are at the beginning of the chapter or text.
Otherwise the initials are at the end of the applicable sentence.

   Rigging equipment and procedures described in this manual may not be authorized for all aircraft or services
because of equipment or service restrictions.

Natick Research, Development, and Engineering Center:

                                           CAUTION
  One to five empty fuel drums are not a stable load and are not certified for sling loading.
One to five empty fuel drums may cause damage to the aircraft and endanger the aircrew due
                        to violent oscillations and inherent instability.
