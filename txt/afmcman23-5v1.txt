          1.4.2.2.3. The DAA completes blocks 21, 21a and 21b of the SAAR and E-
          mails/faxes signed DD Form 2875 and any associated documents to the OC DISA
          POC to obtain UserIDs for D035A requestors.
          1.4.2.2.4. OC DISA verifies DAA authority to request access by consulting Contacts
          List provided by AFSC/LOMM, establishes UserIDs for approved requestors and
          provides this information to the DAA.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                           55


       1.4.2.2.5. The DAA forwards UserID, PIN and instructions for obtaining logon
       procedures from OC DISA to requestors.
       1.4.2.2.6. RAMP/WHSL User Account Maintenance.
          1.4.2.2.6.1. Obtaining Logon Procedures. After receiving their new UserID, user

             1.4.2.2.6.2.2. Account Suspension Removal. Users must call the OC DISA
             Helpdesk and provide their PIN to get their access reactivated.
             1.4.2.2.6.2.3. Account Deactivation. Accounts suspended due to inactivity
             are deactivated if they remain suspended and are not accessed within 30 days
             from date of suspension. There is no reactivating of deactivated accounts.
             Deactivated accounts will require a new DD Form 2875 to regain access.
             1.4.2.2.6.2.4. Requesting RAMP/WHSL Account Deactivations. Prior to
             leaving a position for which RAMP/WHSL access is required, the user must
             submit a new DD Form 2875. Note: The user’s supervisor may initiate the

          copy documents must be securely stored in a location accessible only to the
          primary and alternate DAAs. Note: The AFMC Lead RAMP/WHSL DAA will
          provide applicable local site RAMP/WHSL DAAs name, UserID and PIN of user
          access adds and deletes forwards to OC DISA.
          1.4.2.2.7.2. Periodic RAMP/WHSL Reconciliation.
             1.4.2.2.7.2.1. SCS PMO provides to the AFMC Lead RAMP/WHSL DAA a
             list of users identifying date they last accessed RAMP/WHSL and whether
             they intend to advise OC DISA to suspend or delete their access. Note: The
             PMO provides OC DISA this list at the same time it is provided to the AFMC
             Lead RAMP/WHSL DAA.
             1.4.2.2.7.2.2. The AFMC Lead RAMP/WHSL                DAA    provides   this
             information to each local site RAMP/WHSL DAA.
             1.4.2.2.7.2.3. The local site RAMP/WHSL DAA will provide this

                  1.4.2.2.7.3.1. SCS PMO provides to the AFMC Lead RAMP/WHSL DAA a
                  list of all users identifying their roles and date they last accessed
                  RAMP/WHSL on a monthly basis.
                  1.4.2.2.7.3.2. The AFMC Lead RAMP/WHSL DAA provides                       this
                  information to each local site RAMP/WHSL DAA on a monthly basis.
                  1.4.2.2.7.3.3. The DAA will use this list annually to: identify unauthorized
                  users and request OC DISA delete their accounts; validate the roles of
                  remaining authorized users; and ensure they have current and complete
                  SAARs for all active users. Note: The DAA may require users to process
                  new SAAR modifying assigned roles.
1.5. Contingency Plan. Each AFMC ICP must develop a Continuity of Operations (COOP)
plan IAW AFI 10-208, Air Force Continuity of Operations (COOP) Program, that provides
guidance to support customers in the event system access is lost due to emergency situations
(e.g., earthquake, flood, equipment or facility malfunction, loss of personnel, loss of energy,
sabotage and fire) or when other circumstances impose significant limitations on normal
processing. It is highly recommended that AFMC ICPs use an automated disaster recovery
planning application to develop and maintain their plan.
   1.5.1. Users will report all subsystem deficiencies, errors, etc., which cause delays,
   interruptions, rerun of production processing or results in inefficiencies to the AFSC Lead
   Functional OPR. AFMC Lead and ICP Functional OPRs initiate data system Deficiency
   Reports (DR) to resolve system deficiencies.
       1.5.2. Contingency plans must account for the following scenarios:
          1.5.2.1. Platform Availability.
          1.5.2.1.1. Midtier or local AFMC ICP D035 mainframe domains become unavailable
          with no transactions being received or input and no data being retrieved; however,
          interfacing applications are operational (e.g., DSS and SBSS).
          1.5.2.1.2. Midtier or local AFMC ICP D035 mainframe domains and interfacing
          applications become unavailable.
       1.5.2.2. Connectivity availability.
          1.5.2.2.1. Connection to Midtier or local AFMC ICP D035 mainframe domains
          become unavailable but transactions are still being received and processed.
          1.5.2.2.2. All communications links go down (i.e., no Midtier, mainframe, internet
          access or E-mail).
          1.5.2.3. Disruption to users’ normal work space that forces relocation to an alternate
          work site.
          1.5.2.4. Disruption in normal manpower and use of resources.
   1.5.3. Contingency plans must detail how to support the following processes regardless of
   which scenarios apply:
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                57


     1.5.3.1. Maintaining asset balance visibility. Refer to Chapter 5 for an explanation of
     the various storage sites that maintain wholesale asset balances. Use the following
     methods to obtain asset balance visibility:
        1.5.3.1.1. Obtain RAMP/WHSL reports. Asset balances are copied to the Midtier on
        a near real time basis. This means asset balance reports available under the
        Wholesale Reports option can be used to provide a snapshot of on-hand balances at
        the start of the contingency.
        1.5.3.1.2. Access asset information via logon to other systems or internet resources.
        Note: Contingency Plans must contain a list of useful systems, websites and AF
        Portal applications (e.g., DSS, Commercial Asset Visibility [CAV], ES-S).
        1.5.3.1.3. Request other system POCs provide asset information.                 Note:
        Contingency Plans must contain a POC list.
     1.5.3.2. Maintaining requisition visibility. Refer to Chapter 3 for an explanation of the
     various methods used to receive requisitions. Use the following methods to obtain
     requisition visibility:
        1.5.3.2.1. Obtain RAMP/WHSL reports. Requisitions are copied to the Midtier on a
        near real time basis. This means requisition reports available under the Wholesale
        Reports option can be used to provide a snapshot of open requisitions at the start of
        the contingency.
        1.5.3.2.2. Contact DLA Transaction Services for assistance. DLA Transaction
        Services personnel may be able to provide a list of transactions received but not
        successfully delivered to the AFMC ICP local router (e.g., M024B). See Chapter 2
        for interfacing systems.
        1.5.3.2.3. Contact AFMC ICP local router support personnel for assistance. Support
        personnel may be able to provide a list of transactions received from DLA
        Transaction Services, but not successfully delivered to mainframe or Midtier.
        1.5.3.2.4. Access requisition information via logon to other systems or internet
        resources. Note: Contingency Plans must contain a list of useful systems, websites
        and AF Portal applications (e.g., DSS, CAV, ES-S, Web Visual Logistics Information
        Processing System [WebVLIPS], AF TRACKER).
     1.5.3.3. Releasing available assets to fill requisitions. Contingency plans must consider
     the following methods to release assets:
        1.5.3.3.1. Request storage activity process off-line release action.
        1.5.3.3.2. Use ES-S to release SBSS-reported assets.
        1.5.3.3.3. Manually input shipping request into a non-collocated D035K system.
        1.5.3.3.4. Create off-line shipping request (MRO or Redistribution Order [RDO])
        transactions for output to M024B/Defense Automatic Addressing System (DAAS).
     1.5.3.4. Tracking inbound and outbound status. Contingency plans must consider the
     following methods to track status:
 58                                                       AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


          1.5.3.4.1. Contact DLA Transaction Services for assistance. DLA Transaction
          Services personnel may be able to provide a list of transactions received but not
          successfully delivered to the AFMC ICP local router (e.g., M024B). See Chapter 2
          for interfacing systems.
          1.5.3.4.2. Contact AFMC ICP local router support personnel for assistance. Support
          personnel may be able to provide a list of transactions received from DLA
          Transaction Services, but not successfully delivered to mainframe or Midtier.
          1.5.3.4.3. Access status information via logon to other systems or internet resources.
          Note: Contingency Plans must contain a list of useful systems, websites and AF
          Portal applications (e.g., DSS, CAV, ES-S, WebVLIPS and AF TRACKER).
   1.5.4. Recovery Procedures. Contingency plans must provide guidance for return to normal
   stock control operations. System access will be limited to selected users until all backlogged
   transactions have been processed. Note: Restrictive MRC “L” must be assigned to all NSNs
   actioned off-line during contingencies. Once all backlogged transactions are processed, the
   MRC ”L” can be removed.
1.6. System Health and User Compliance.
   1.6.1. Monitoring. Maintaining a healthy stock control environment requires system and
   functional OPR periodic review of chronic areas of concern (e.g., use of FD document
   numbers, use of action codes and MRC application). Specific requirements for system
   monitoring are identified throughout this document as well as in applicable inspection
   checklist(s).
   1.6.2. Checklist. The Logistics Compliance Assessment Program (LCAP) Checklist,
   Wholesale Stock Control Process, evaluates user compliance with established procedures.
   1.6.3. Metrics. Use trend analyses metrics for known chronic issues of concern to identify

         INTERFACES, DATABASE RECORDS AND KEY DATA ELEMENTS

2.1. Systems Interfaces.
   2.1.1. This chapter details significant data interchanges between D035A/B/RAMP/WHSL
   subsystems and other DoD data processing systems. It further explains key data elements,
   describes the format and purpose of specific database records and provides guidance on
   retaining stock control source documents. Data exchange among D035A/B, RAMP/WHSL
   and other AF/DoD data processing systems supports AFMC’s logistics mission. Database
   record formats, transmission media and frequency of exchange through interface between
   two data processing systems are described by Interface Control Documents (ICD). D035A/B
   and RAMP/WHSL ICDs are developed and maintained by the Stock Control PMO.
   2.1.2. Data systems interfacing with D035A/B and RAMP/WHSL are listed in Table 2.1

2.2. Key Data Elements. NSN, RIC, MDC, document number and PIIN are used as keys to
access virtually every database record maintained in D035A/B and RAMP/WHSL.
   2.2.1. See Chapter 11 for processes used to establish NSNs in D035A/B and
   RAMP/WHSL. See AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 5 for processes used to establish NSNs in
   SSSC. Note: D035A/B and RAMP/WHSL edit processes use the NIIN to find the
   appropriate stock number catalogue record. If NIIN data is correct, but FSC or MMAC data
   is not, the subsystem will automatically correct FSC and MMAC data on the transaction
   being processed.
        2.2.1.1. D035A/B and RAMP/WHSL use NSNs for various reasons:
           2.2.1.1.1. Items are AF-managed by wholesale IMs and one of the following SOS
           RIC applies: FGZ, FHZ, FLZ or FPD. This includes items for which AF is the only
           user, the PICA or the SICA. Note: AF cannot be a SICA to DLA as the PICA.
           2.2.1.1.2. Non-AF managed items can be ordered by depot RIMs in support of depot
           maintenance.
           2.2.1.1.3. Non-AF managed items are stored at an AF depot (whether or not they are
           to be used by AF personnel): OS/A-managed items owned by other than AF; or
           OS/A-managed items owned by AF (e.g., in an aggregation account).
           2.2.1.1.4. AF and non-AF managed items can be ordered by contractors using GFM
           procedures.
        2.2.1.2. I&SG coding is used to link NSNs of items that basically have the same
        characteristics and function and can be used in place of each other. I&SG families
        normally evolve as weapon systems mature and modifications occur. I&SG items may
        be both one- and two-way interchangeable. D043 provides I&SG data to D035A which
        syncs to RAMP/WHSL.
           2.2.1.2.1. References for I&SG coding and cataloging information are in DoD
           4100.39.M, Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS) Procedures Manual,
           Volume 6, Chapter 6, and AFMCMAN 23-3, Cataloging and Standardization,
           Chapter 36, Interchangeability and Substitutability (I&S) Program and AFMC
           Instruction 20-101, Elimination of Duplication in the Management and Logistics
           Support of Interchangeable and Substitutable Items.
        2.2.1.2.2. Rules for I&SG families and subgroups. If any of the following basic rules are
        violated, D035A will not create I&SG family grouping:
2.2.1.2.2.1. Family cannot exceed 50 NSNs.
2.2.1.2.2.2. All members of family must be in same FSC.
62                                                    AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


            2.2.1.2.2.3. All items in an I&SG must have the same Controlled Inventory Item
            Code (CIIC) except CIICs 7 and U which may be commingled in the same I&SG.
            2.2.1.2.2.4. Generally, all members must have the same MMAC; an exception is
            allowed for the following codes: VG, VH, VL and VP (peculiar items for DoD
            I&SG only).
            2.2.1.2.2.5. A NSN with assigned AAC W is only allowed for the generic master
            NSN of an I&SG family. See DoD 4100.39-M, Volume 10, Table 58 for a
            complete list of AACs.
            2.2.1.2.2.6. FMS peculiar NSNs (AAC P) are not allowed in I&SG families.
            2.2.1.2.2.7. All Major Organizational Entity (MOE) rules on related NSNs must
            also be recorded on the master NSN.
            2.2.1.2.2.8. All members of a family must have the same ICP RIC.
            2.2.1.2.2.9. All members of a family must have the same IM MDC.
            2.2.1.2.2.10. All members of a family must have the same Equipment Specialist
            (ES) MDC.
            2.2.1.2.2.11. All members of a family must have the same MRC.
            2.2.1.2.2.12. All members of a family must have the same Lean Logistics (LL)
            code.
     2.2.1.2.3. An I&SG subgroup may consist of one or more NSNs, all of which must be
     interchangeable. I&SG subgroups are arranged in alphabetical sequence based on
     desirability of a particular NSN’s use within the I&SG family. I&SG subgroups are
     identified by a 2-character alphabetic code, assigned in alphabetical order (AA, AB, AC,
     etc.) starting with the least desired subgroup (see AFH 23-123, Volume 2, Part 2,
     Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S), Standard Base Supply System Operations,
     para 8.82.3.1.). The I&SG subgroup containing the master item is always last in the
     family. The Order of Use (OOU) determines how the I&SG family functions. The OOU
     code is made up of a 2-character alphabetic Subgroup Code and a 1-character Parts
     Preference Code (PPC). The PPC is usually alphabetic, but can be a Numeric Parts
     Preference Code (NPPC) in only the following two cases:
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                    63


Table 2.2. I&SG NPPCs
NPPC      Description
          Indicates an active item that must be modified or re-identified according to a
          Technical Order (TO) or TCTO. Additionally, the phrase code on the NSN must be
          an “R.” Once the item has been modified, it becomes a different NSN with a more
4
          preferred position in the I&SG family. As long as this code remains a “4,” the system
          treats the item as obsolete; requisitions received without the appropriate advice code
          are “CJ” rejected.
          Indicates the NSN is unacceptable for AF use. As long as this code remains a “9,” the
9         system treats the item as obsolete; requisitions received without the appropriate advice
          code are “CJ” rejected.

       2.2.1.2.4. See Chapter 3 for examples of I&SG families and their uses in processing
       requisition transactions.
    2.2.2. Manager Designator Codes (MDC).
       2.2.2.1. IM MDC.
          2.2.2.1.1. Not all NSNs can or must be assigned an IM MDC.
              2.2.2.1.1.1. Items exempted from IM MDC establishment in D035 are:
                  2.2.2.1.1.1.1. Items with RICs FG5, FGL, FL5, and FZZ. Although they are
                  visible in D035, there is no other stock control functionality applied to them.
                  Permanent assignment of IM MDCs to these items is not possible.
                  2.2.2.1.1.1.2. Non-AF-managed items unless there is a PICA/SICA
                  relationship.
                  2.2.2.1.1.1.3. Locally-established “L” or “P” items.
                  2.2.2.1.1.1.4. Budget Code 9 items.
              2.2.2.1.1.2. Items requiring IM MDC assignment must meet the following
              criteria:
                  2.2.2.1.1.2.1. On the NSNB screen for items with File Maintenance Code
                  (File Maint Cd) “A,” “C,” or “Q,” the data in the field labeled “Svcr Mgr RI”
                  must correspond to the AFMC ICP RIC on the NSNB screen in the D035A
                  domain where the item is managed. For example, if the user is viewing the
                  NSNB screen in the Hill D035A domain, the Svcr Mgr RI must be FGZ (i.e.,
                  the same NSN may be visible in AFLCMC/HN, Robins and/or Tinker D035A
                  domains, but because the Svcr Mgr RI is FGZ it is not possible to establish an
                  IM MDC in those other D035A domains).
                  2.2.2.1.1.2.2. Data in the field labeled File Maint Cd must be “A,” “C,” or
                  “Q” on the NSNB screen in the D035A domain where the item is managed.
                  These are active items primarily established via the D143C-to-D043-to-D035
                  interface. File Maint Cds “D,” “N,” “U,” or “X” indicate D043 does not
                  recognize the applicable item; however, assets, levels or system records exist
    64                                                   AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


                which require IM oversight/action to process and resolve. See Table 2.3 for
                list of file maintenance codes used in D035A.

Table 2.3. D035A File Maintenance Codes
Code         Explanation
             1. Indicates index record to be added to AFMC ICP file.
             2. Used to force feed new NSNs to the applicable IM’s AFMC ICP.
             3. Used in response to nonprime user notice when submitted identity is
             identifiable as a current identity or is mechanically traceable to a current identity.
A            Used to furnish a complete set of index records, including the current identity
             plus all its recorded reference numbers and, if I&SG related, all the current
             I&SG member identifiers and all their recorded reference numbers.
             4. Used as stated for nonprime user for notices of prime unidentified items,
             except when the submitted number is identified to a new NSN for which the
             submitting AFMC ICP has lost IM responsibility.
             1. Overlay existing file data with data contained in the maintenance record
             received.
C
             2. Used to provide management data changes and identity changes to all using
             AFMC ICP's as recorded in the D143A files (prime and nonprime users).
              1. Deletes index record from AFMC ICP files.
             2. Used to notify all AFMC ICP's recorded as a user to delete the index record
D            (applies when item goes non-pub).
             3. Used when a user notice is received from an AFMC ICP (prime or nonprime)
             and the item is coded non-pub in the central systems files.
             1. Changes NSN status codes.
I            2. Used in conjunction with I&SG changes to update the NSN status codes
             when full stock control data is not being furnished.
             1. Deletes Equipment Authorization Inventory Data (EAID) code.
K            2. Used for limited posting of index record on AFMC ICP file to only delete
             EAID code “E” from position 90.
             1. Adds “ND” or “K” NSN index records to the AFMC ICP files.
M            2. Used when an “ND” or “K” NSN is established in the D143A files to add the
             index record to the AFMC ICP files.
             1. Indicates the AF is not registered as a user of the submitted NSN according to
             the DLA Logistics Information Services federal files.
N            2. Used when an NSN (submitted by a prime or nonprime AFMC ICP) is not
             identifiable in the central system files (not a current identity, not a recorded
             reference number, nor a MMAC variation of a basic FSC-NIIN recorded in the
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                 65


Code       Explanation
           central files) and the results of DLA Logistics Information Services screening
           reveals the NSN to be valid, but the AF is not a registered user.
           1. Indicates advance price change.
P          2. Used to record an advance price in the AFMC ICP index record when full
           stock control data is not being furnished concurrently.
           1. Adds item to AFMC ICP file if identity is not in the file or treat as file
           maintenance code "C" if matched to the file.
           2. Used in response to an AFMC ICP user notice when the D143A file indicates
Q          that the submitting AFMC ICP is already on distribution for the item.
           3. Used under certain conditions when I&SG involvement results in an “XAA”
           record being produced for an AFMC ICP that is already recorded as a user in the
           D143A files.
           1. Indicates the item received on an AFMC ICP user notice cannot be identified
           or cannot be brought forward mechanically to a current identity.
           2. Response to prime’s unidentified notice from using AFMC ICP.
           3. Use when the submitted NSN cannot be identified in the central AFMC
           systems or the DLA Logistics Information Services federal files
           4. Indicates the submitted NSN will appear in both the index number and
           current number fields of the “XAA” record returned to the submitting AFMC
           ICP. The two numbers will appear on the resulting D143B management print-
           out (product D143BMT6A) when the “XAA” is received and on a recurring
           basis as long as the record remains in the D143B file coded “U.” Note: The
           NSN being repeated in both index and current NSN fields on the first print-out is
U          the key indication that the NSN is truly unidentified.
           5. If the submitted NSN can be mechanically traced to a current number and the
           submitting AFMC ICP is prime for the current NSN, index maintenance records
           will be returned to the AFMC ICP (“XAA-A” or “Q”) bringing the AFMC ICP
           file forward to the current identity. If a loss of prime occurs, “XAA-U” will be
           returned. Also, if the submitted NSN is determined to be an unrecorded MMAC
           variation of the FSC/NIIN, an “XAA-U” will be returned to the submitting
           D143B. This condition can be recognized by the appearance of a different NSN
           in the current NSN field of the first print-out only of product D143BMT6A,
           upon receipt of the “XAA-U” in D143B from D143A. The current NSN is not
           retained by D143B for printing on subsequent print-outs of product
           D143BMT6A while the index record remains in file with the “U” code.
           Subsequent to the first print-out, the submitted NSN will appear in both fields.
           1. Indicates there is no management data recorded in the central files for an
X          NSN submitted by the AFMC ICP (prime or nonprime).
           2. Used when screening of the central files fails to identify the NSN as a current
 66                                                       AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


Code          Explanation
              NSN, a recorded reference number or as an MMAC variation of a recorded
              current NSN and the results of DLA Logistics Information Services screening
              indicates that the AF is a registered user of the NSN in the federal files.
              3. Indicates the responsible AF activity has failed to input the necessary
              identification and management data transactions for establishing the NSN in the
              central AFMC files.
              1. Deletes index record of nonprime items from AFMC ICP master files.
Y             2. Used in response to “XAG” user delete transactions received from an AFMC
              ICP on nonprime items.
              1. Purges index record from AFMC ICP file.
              2. Used when a reference number is to be deleted from the using AFMC ICP
              files (this transaction will match a reference to current index record). The current
Z             identity and other reference number index records to that current identity, will
              not be affected by this action, unless the reference being purged is the only
              reference recorded against the NSN and the NSN is a bachelor. In which case an
              "XAA-I," changing the status of the current index record to “l”; the unreferenced
              bachelor will be issued concurrently with the “XAA-Z.”

                 2.2.2.1.1.2.3. The existing IM MDC must either be erroneous or unassigned
                 (i.e., blank).
          2.2.2.1.2. Steps for assigning an IM MDC to an NSN:
             2.2.2.1.2.1. Using the criteria found in paragraph 2.2.3.1.1.2, identify which
             items require assignment of an AF wholesale IM MDC. D035A/B also executes a
             nightly batch process that identifies items needing an IM MDC as type “3E”
             controlled exceptions. These exceptions are assigned to default IM MDC “PPP.”
             2.2.2.1.2.2. Determine an appropriate IM MDC to be assigned. It may be useful
             to check the following sources:
                 2.2.2.1.2.2.1. Check the HIS screens in D043 for IM MDCs that may
                 previously have been assigned to the item.
                 2.2.2.1.2.2.2. Check D143C for recent cataloging action.
                 2.2.2.1.2.2.3. Identify who already manages other items with the same FSC
                 and/or MMAC as the item for which an IM MDC needs to be assigned.
                 Access the AF Mission Workload Assignment System (D086) to cross
                 reference item FSC and/or MMAC to the AFMC ICP responsible for item
                 management.
                 2.2.2.1.2.2.4. Check RAMP/WHSL. It is possible for item information not
                 available in D035A/B to be visible in RAMP/WHSL.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                    67


             2.2.2.1.2.3. Ensure the selected IM MDC appears on the WHSL MDC table.
             2.2.2.1.2.4. Ensure the person assigned to the IM MDC has a RAMP or WHSL
             user profile established IAW Chapter 1.
             2.2.2.1.2.5. Use the WHSL “Item MDC/ES Code Modification” page to type in
             the desired IM MDC and then click on the “Submit” button. Note: Data in the
             ES code field cannot be left blank and must be found on the “Equipment
             Specialist Code” table.
         2.2.2.1.3. There are multiple reasons why IM MDCs are mechanically removed from
         NSNs: item management transfers within AFMC between two ICPs; item
         management transfers to an OS/A; or the item AAC changes to “Y” and no D035
         subsystem shows potential future use for the item that would prevent its deletion.
     2.2.2.2. ES MDC.
         2.2.2.2.1. Although ES MDCs are not used by D035A/B or RAMP/WHSL, they can
         be displayed in these applications. Not all NSNs can be assigned an ES MDC. The
         following items can be assigned an ES MDC:
             2.2.2.2.1.1. Items whose ICP RIC is FGZ, FHZ, FLZ, FPD, F2U, F4U, F8U, or
             “F/numeric/numeric” (CSWS contractors). Note: D035A provides ES MDCs to
             both D043 and D200 for these items.
             2.2.2.2.1.2. Items whose item management responsibility has transferred to an
             OS/A, but the AF retains engineering responsibility. Note: D035A retains ES
             MDCs on transferred items; however, it does not provide these codes to D043 and
             D200.
         2.2.2.2.2. AFMC ICP personnel must determine which ES MDCs to use and how to
         apportion them among local users.
         2.2.2.2.3. Steps for assigning an ES MDC to an NSN:
             2.2.2.2.3.1. Ensure the selected ES MDC appears on the WHSL “ES Code
             Table.”
             2.2.2.2.3.2. Ensure the person assigned to the ES MDC has a WHSL user profile
             established.
             2.2.2.2.3.3. Use the WHSL “Item MDC/ES Code Modification” page to type in
             the desired ES MDC and then click on the “Submit” button.
         2.2.2.2.4. WHSL syncs ES MDC to D035A only for items whose ICP RIC is FGZ,
         FHZ, FLZ, FPD, F2U, F4U, and F8U. Note: RAMP/WHSL feeds ES name, office
         symbol, phone, and E-mail information to OO D035A/B for D043 to pull daily.
  2.2.3. A unique document number will be assigned and used to identify each accountable
  action in D035A. An accountable action is defined as any transaction that generates a feed to
  D035J subsystem. For example, transactions that change inventory balances (e.g., issues and
  receipts) or creates obligations (e.g., funded requisitions passed to or from another service or
  a MRP transaction where the AF buys assets back from the customer) are considered
  accountable actions. See DLM 4000.25-1, Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue
 68                                                     AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014

                           D035A are also reserved to identify specific actions. D035A users
                           will not use these characters when creating document numbers.
                           The reserved characters are as follows:

                                        requisition (Document Identifier Codes [DIC] A0A or
                                        A01 and action code “O2” transaction) to return
                                        unserviceable materiel to a depot or to the local
                                        disposal activity.
                                        - The DoDAAC is set equal to the managing D035A
                                        DoDAAC and the Julian date is set based on the
                                        processing date. For example, the first RDO
                           F and H
                                        requisition transaction created by RAMP for an
                                        Ogden managed stock number on June 1st, 2011 is
                                        represented as document number FD20201152F001.
                                        - A serial number beginning with “H” is only used by
                                        RAMP if more than 999 RDO requisition transactions
                                        are created on the same day. So, after using serial
                                        number “F999,” the next RDO requisition transaction
                                        would be serial number “H001.”
                                        Used on FMS requisitions to indicate unserviceable
                           H            assets returned to the AF prior to the requisition being
                                        submitted for a replacement asset.
                                        Used by RDS when it creates a disposal order

                                        based on the processing date. The “Y” identifies

   2.2.4. PIIN. A PIIN will be used in lieu of a document number on receipts from a
   procurement source (DIC D4_ transactions). The 14th position of the document number is
   left blank. A PIIN may also be used on IAV transactions associated with a D4_ receipt
   transaction. For example, if the received materiel is suspended for litigation purposes, the
   inter-condition transfer transaction may contain the PIIN from the disputed receipt
   transaction. An example PIIN is F3460111D0327. See Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS),
   Subpart 204.70 for further details on PIIN configuration.
2.3. Maintaining Audit Trail.
   2.3.1. D035A/B and RAMP/WHSL archive transactions that affect accountable balances
   (i.e., SCC changes, inventory adjustments, issues, Ownership/Purpose (O/P) code changes
   and receipts); as such, there is little need to maintain hard copy documents.
   2.3.2. In those rare cases for which an online archive is not provided, users will maintain
   hard copy documents for actions taken that affect accountable balances. Retain these records
   for at least 75 months.

                                            Chapter 3

                                REQUISITION PROCESSING

3.1. Overview. This chapter explains the various processes in D035A associated with initial
requisition and requisition modifier transactions. Because these processes are complicated,
paragraphs are provided that focus on specific types of requisitions (e.g., a requisition from a
repair contractor organization) or specific steps in the entire process (e.g., pre-positioning a BO
for automatic release by WARRS D035K subsystem).
3.2. Ordering.
   3.2.1. Customers submit requisitions or requisition modifiers through an automated interface
   or through manual actions.
       3.2.1.1. D035A has an automated, near real-time interface with DAAS. The vast
       majority of AFMC’s customers have a retail data system that allows them to transmit an
       80-record position requisition or requisition modifier transaction to DAAS, which is
       responsible for forwarding the transaction to the correct D035A subsystem. In most
       cases, a requisition or requisition modifier transaction input into a retail data system is
       received and processed by D035A within two hours.
       3.2.1.2. For a customer who does not have a retail data system that interfaces with
       DAAS, a manual method must be used to submit an off-line requisition or requisition
       modifier transaction. There may also be times when a customer with a DAAS interface
       may decide to use a manual method to submit their requirements (e.g., the retail data
       system is unavailable). The IM or their designated representative (e.g., customer support
       center) may receive an off-line requisition or requisition modifier transaction by fax, E-
       mail, mail, message, telephone or courier. Authorized requisitioning documents are DD
       Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document; DD Form 1348-6, Single Line Item
       Requisition System Document, DoD (Manual-Long Form); and DD Form 1348M, Single
       Line Item Requisition System Document, DoD (Mechanical). A D035A user must enter
       the required data from the form into D035A using either the NEW (requisition) screen or
       the RQM (requisition modifier) screen.
   3.2.2. D035A processes a DoDAAC file which identifies capitalized customer DoDAACs
   and non-capitalized customer DoDAACs from whom requisitions can be received.
       3.2.2.1. Capitalized customers use either the SBSS or D035K to submit a requisition to
       D035A. D035A issues stock funded assets to capitalized customers as transfers between
       accounts. This type of supply customer is not billed when materiel is shipped to fill their
       order; rather, a sale does not occur until the supply unit issues assets to their customer
       (e.g., base or depot maintenance).
       3.2.2.2. Non-capitalized customers (e.g., contractors, OS/A and foreign countries) are
       usually billed for stock funded items via direct sales when materiel is shipped to fill their
       order. Only AFMC/A4 has the authority to waive the billing of a non-capitalized
       customer (referred to as a free issue). An IM is not authorized to use a wholesale
       document number (i.e., begins with “FD”) to force ship serviceable assets to fill a non-
       capitalized customer’s requirements. See paragraph 3.14 for explanation regarding the
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                    71


       various points of sale or transfer that exist within AF supply systems (i.e., D035A,
       D035K and SBSS). It is important that an IM understand these points of sale or transfer
       to avoid creating a free issue by mistake.
3.3. Initial Processing of a Requisition.
   3.3.1. A requisition is input into D035A in one of six ways:
       3.3.1.1. A requisition may be received through the online DAAS interface. A transaction
       received through this interface is automatically input into D035A for processing. Note:
       If additional information is required for storage, packaging or transportation, the third
       position of the requisition document number input must contain a “5” or “E” (A_5/A_E).
       The required clear text narrative, type of organization receiving the materiel and reason
       for issuing the materiel cannot be transmitted via the DAAS interface and results in the
       requisition being suspended as an “8H” (Support Clear Txt Data Missing) controlled
       exception.
       3.3.1.2. Although least preferred, off-line requisitions may be manually entered into
       D035A through the NEW screen as a transaction with Code (DIC) A0_, A3_, or A4_ in
       rp 1-3. Data in rp 4-6 will contain either an ICP RIC (e.g., FGZ) or an action code to
       accomplish the following: release for shipment (e.g., DICs O1_, O2_, V1_, V3_, etc.);
       passing action (i.e., BM); or forced BO (i.e., B4, BB, BV, BZ or NP). Note: Off-line
       requisitions will only be used when no other procedures are available as they create the
       potential for incomplete audit trails.
           3.3.1.2.1. If additional information is required for storage, packaging or
           transportation, the third position of the requisition document number input must
           contain a “5” or “E” (DIC A_5 or A_E). Users input this additional information for
           all A_5/A_E transactions on the clear text entry panel. When users enter an “FD”
           document number, but no Supplementary Address (SUPADD), a second panel
           displays for the user to identify the type of organization receiving the materiel and
           reason for issuing the materiel.
           3.3.1.2.2. Note: Clear text information is kept as part of the official audit trail and
           will be as comprehensive as possible (reference paragraph 2.3).
       3.3.1.3. A requisition created by the collocated D035K subsystem (i.e., depot retail
       supply) is overlaid directly into D035A for processing. For example, for a Tinker depot
       D035A IM, the Tinker depot D035K subsystem is referred to as collocated, while the
       Ogden depot and Warner-Robins depot D035K subsystems are referred to as non-
       collocated. Note: There is no instance of D035K at AFLCMC/HN.
       3.3.1.4. A requisition created by an application on the SCS Midtier server is overlaid
       directly into D035A for processing.
           3.3.1.4.1. RAMP and RDS subsystems create requisitions that are processed by
           D035A. Refer to Chapter 6 for further details regarding RAMP and to AFMCMAN
           23-5, Volume 3, Reutilization/Disposition System (D035G), for further details
           regarding RDS.
           3.3.1.4.2. The SSSC subsystem creates requisitions that are processed by D035A.
           Refer to Volume 5, Chapters 3, 4 and 5 for further details.
72                                                       AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


     3.3.1.5. A requisition created by the ES-S web application server is overlaid directly into
     D035A for processing. Accessed through the AF Portal, ES-S also updates SBSS. This
     application will be used in place of contacting the IM for authorized off-line processing
     of high priority requisitions.
     3.3.1.6. A Requisition Modifier (AM_) transaction may be initiated by the requisitioner,
     Supplementary Addressee (SUPADD) or control office to modify a previously submitted
     requisition. These transactions can be entered into the system from an online panel or
     processed through the DAAS inbound interface. If the document number of the
     requisition to be modified is not on record in the SCS and is not entered online, the
     modifier is converted to and processed as, a new requisition DIC A0_.
         3.3.1.6.1. DIC A0_ will only be generated for FMS if the document number date is
         within the last 180 days.
         3.3.1.6.2. DIC A0_ will only be generated for non-FMS if the document number date
         is within the last 120 days. If the modifier is not received in the allotted time frame,
         status code BM will be output for FMS and BF for non-FMS.
  3.3.2. Every data element in a requisition received by D035A is validated to ensure that it
  can correctly process the order. The formats for these transactions are defined in DLM
  4000.25-1, Appendix 3. The following data edits are performed (the applicable transaction
  rps are noted in the beginning of each code description):
     3.3.2.1. DIC (rp 1-3).
         3.3.2.1.1. Valid values for a requisition DIC types are A0_, A3_, or A4. For any
         other value, the transaction is not processed by D035A as a requisition. The most
         likely reason this situation would occur is that a user input an AO_ (letter “A,” letter
         “O”) DIC type code. An “AO” transaction would be suspended as a type “3S”
         controlled exception. See Table 3.1.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                    73



Table 3.1. Valid Values for Requisition DIC Type Codes
DIC Type
                  Description
Code
A0_               1. Indicates the transaction was created by the DoDAAC (rp 30-35) and the
                  processing D035A site is recognized by DAAS as the ICP for the ordered
                  NSN.
                  2. For DIC A0_, DAAS reroutes the transaction if the “To” RIC entered by
                  the customer does not contain the correct ICP RIC of the requisitioned NSN
                  for the OS/A identified by the first character of the document number.
A3_ or A4_        1. Indicates the transaction was not created by the DoDAAC (rp30-35).
                  2. The initial A0_ transaction was sent to another data system, which passed
                  A DIC A3_ transaction or referred the A4_ transaction to the processing
                  D035A site.
                  3. For DICs A3_ or A4_, DAAS does not reroute the transaction.
                  4. There is no meaningful difference between DICs A3_ and A4_ as far as
                  D035A processing is concerned.
                  5. Examples of why D035A may receive one of these types of requisitions
                  are as follows:
                                     1. A requisition from a foreign country is first sent to a
                                     FMS data system responsible for validating that the country
                                     is authorized to order the materiel from the AF’s wholesale
                  FMS                supply system.
                                     2. For an AF FMS requisition, this data system is SAMIS.
                                     FMS requisitions contain a MAPAC in place of a DoDAAC
                                     in the first six positions of the document number
                                     1. A requisition from a contractor for GFM is first sent to a
                                     Management Control Activity (MCA) data system
                                     responsible for validating that the contractor is authorized
                  GFM
                                     to order GFM from a government wholesale supply system.
                                     2. For AF contractor GFM requisitions, this data system is
                                     either SSSC or the CAV-AF system.
                                     A requisition from a non-AF organization is first sent to an
                                     OS/A ICP data system responsible for validating that funds
                  Other S/A
                                     are available to buy the materiel from the AF’s wholesale
                                     supply system.
                                     Management responsibility for an NSN has transferred from
                  Item
                                     one D035A domain to another domain so the “losing”
                  Management
                                     D035A subsystem passes backordered requisitions to the
                  Transfer
                                     “gaining” D035A subsystem.
           3.3.2.1.2. Valid DIC suffix codes are 2, 4, 5, A, B, D, and E. A numeric value
           indicates that the materiel is to be shipped to a location Outside the Continental
           United States (OCONUS), while an alphabetic value indicates that the materiel is to
           be shipped to a location inside the CONUS. See Table 3.2.

Table 3.2. Valid Values for Requisition Suffix Codes
Suffix Code     Description
                1. Indicates the transaction contains an NSN (rp 8-22).
1 or A          2. If rp 8-22 contain an invalid value, D035A defaults to an “A” (based on the
                geographic area code of the DoDAAC [rp 30-35]).
                1. Indicates the transaction contains a P/N in rp 8-2).
                2. P/N requisitions are not processed by D035A; instead, they are suspended as
                type “1C” controlled exceptions for manual research and action. See Chapter 8
2 or B          for further details.
                3. For requisitions to be processed by D035A, a valid NSN must be assigned and
                the suffix code changed to 4, 5, A, D, or E. Refer to Chapter 4 for further
                details.
                1. Indicates the requisition contains a non-NSN value (e.g., an AF-assigned kit
4 or D          number) in rp 8-22.
                2. D035A treats these two codes the same as suffix code A.
                1. Indicates additional support data (e.g., special packaging or transportation
                instructions) is required to process the requisition.
                2. For an off-line requisition input through the NEW screen, D035A prompts the
                user for additional support data.
                3. Additional support data is not available to the system for requisitions received
5 or E          via DAAS or SCS Midtier interface, so the transaction is suspended as a type
                “8H” controlled exception. See Chapter 8 for further details.
                4. Using suffix codes 5 or E to simply request next day delivery is not
                recommended, because the shipment request transaction sent by D035A does not
                contain the support data. This causes the shipping activity to unnecessarily
                suspend the transaction for manual action.

         3.3.2.2. “To” RIC (rp 4-6). This typically contains the RIC of the processing D035A site
         (FGZ, FHZ, FLZ, or FPD. A transaction with an invalid “To” RIC is normally
         suspended as a type “6C” controlled exception. The exceptions to this rule are as
         follows:
            3.3.2.2.1. FMS Only RICs. To clearly identify an NSN as an item maintained within
            D035A to support FMS requisitions, the non-standard ICP RICs of F2U, F4U, and
            F8U are used. These RICs are only valid on a requisition and are not valid as an
            owning RIC for materiel stored by a wholesale storage activity. D035A translates
            these codes into the appropriate processing D035A site RIC (F2U becomes FLZ; F4U
            becomes FGZ; and F8U becomes FHZ) before the transaction is processed any
            further. SB&CR data for an NSN with a non-standard ICP RIC is not reported to
            SIRS (D200A). Assigning AAC P to the NSN has the exact same impact.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                75


        3.3.2.2.2. Air Munitions Item RIC. The RICs of FG5 and FL5 are not D035A RICs.
        These RICs are used by CAS and D035A cannot process a requisition for an NSN
        with an ICP RIC of either FG5 or FL5.
        3.3.2.2.3. Manager-Forced Action Codes. The first two positions of the “To” RIC
        are also used to store a manager-forced action code (Note: The third position is
        blank). The NEW screen is normally used to manually create such a transaction;
        however, other subsystem processes may also create a transaction with a manager-
        forced action code. For example, RAMP uses the “O2” action code to automatically
        redistribute unserviceable assets reported by SBSS customers who have not yet
        shipped these assets IAW RIMCS; RDS uses the “VD” action code to initiate
        disposal; and the Depot Maintenance Inter-service Support Agreement (DMISA)
        turn-in from maintenance process uses the “V3” action code to relocate assets
        between storage locations (see Chapter 7 for further details regarding DMISA
        processes). A transaction with an invalid action code is suspended as a type “2Q”
        controlled exception. A transaction with an “O2,” “V3,” or “VD” action code that
        does not contain a document number with the processing site’s “FD” DoDAAC is
        suspended as a type “3X” controlled exception. More information on action codes is
        provided in the paragraphs that explain the ship-from DoDAAC and ship-from RICs.
     3.3.2.3. M&S Code. This code is very significant to DAAS as the system responsible for
     providing the status to the customer; however, for D035A, this code is mainly
     informational. For a manager-forced shipment requisition, D035A defaults the M&S
     code to a “0” to stop DAAS from sending status transactions back to D035A. For all
     other types of requisitions, if the M&S code is not valid, D035A defaults to an S. The S
     indicates to DAAS that the organization identified by the DoDAAC in the document
     number receives an electronic copy of any supply (DIC AE1) or shipment (DIC AS1)
     status transaction processed. M&S codes are defined in DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.4.
     3.3.2.4. NSN (rp 8-22). Refer to DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.5 for additional
     information.
        3.3.2.4.1. If the NSN contains a P/N, D035A attempts to convert the P/N into an
        NSN by searching a part-number-to-NSN cross-reference database. If no matching
        NSN is found, the transaction is suspended as a type “1C” controlled exception;
        otherwise, the P/N data is replaced with the NSN data and processing continues.
        Because this cross-reference database is internal to the system, it is highly unlikely
        that a P/N requisition will be automatically converted into an NSN requisition.
        3.3.2.4.2. If the NSN does not contain a P/N, the NIIN is used to search the D035A
        item database.
            3.3.2.4.2.1. If no matching item database record is found, the MMAC is used to
            determine if the NSN is possibly managed by a different AFMC ICP. If so, the
            requisition is automatically passed to the other ICP RIC; otherwise, the FSC is
            used in the exact same manner. If the requisition was not passed, it is suspended
            as a type “3A” controlled exception.
            3.3.2.4.2.2. If a matching item database record is found, the FSC and MMAC
            from this record are used in place of the FSC and MMAC data received from the
76                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


            customer. If the item database record indicates that the ICP is a site other than the
            processing D035A site, the requisition is automatically passed to the other ICP
            RIC.
     3.3.2.5. Unit of Issue (rp 23-24) and Quantity (rp 25-29). The UI must correspond to the
     UI retrieved from the matching item database record. If it does not, a UI conversion table
     is used to see if D035A can automatically correct both the UI and the quantity. If the
     conversion cannot be accomplished, the requisition is rejected with status code CE. UIs
     are defined in DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.6.
     3.3.2.6. Document Number. Refer to DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.7 for additional
     information.
        3.3.2.6.1. If the document number contains a DoDAAC, this data is used to access
        the DoDAAC database maintained by the D035T. If no matching DoDAAC record is
        found, the requisition is suspended as a type “3X” controlled exception. If the
        DoDAAC used is the processing site’s “FD____” DoDAAC, the transaction must
        contain an “O1,” “O2,” “V1,” “V3,” or “VD” action code to avoid a type “2Q”
        controlled exception error.
        3.3.2.6.2. If the document number contains a MAPAC (i.e., the first position of this
        equals “B,” “D,” “K,” or “P”), the two-character country code portion of the MAPAC
        is used to access the country code database maintained by an AFMC Lead D035A
        OPR with HQ OPR access. If no matching country code record is found, the
        requisition is suspended as a type “3X” controlled exception. The other three single-
        character entries that comprise a MAPAC must also be valid; otherwise, the
        requisition is suspended as a type “3X” controlled exception.
            3.3.2.6.2.1. Customer-Within-Country Code. This single-position must contain
            an alphabetic or numeric character to indicate the recipient or place of discharge
            within the country/activity (see Military Assistance Program Address Directory
            [MAPAD]), with the exception of requisitions containing DIC A05 with special
            one-time shipping instructions entered in the Remarks block of the requisition.
            See DLM 4000.25-1, paragraphs C6.3.1.1.1.3, C6.3.1.2.1.3 and C3.11.1.2.2.1 for
            further information regarding customer-within-country code utilization and
            MAPAD.
            3.3.2.6.2.2. FMS Delivery Term Code (DTC). This single-position code
            identifies a FMS shipment’s custody transfer point. See DTR 4500.9-R, Defense
            Transportation Regulation, Part II, Appendix E for additional information.
            3.3.2.6.2.3. Type of Assistance and Financing Code.
        3.3.2.6.3. The date portion of the document number must be a valid Julian date in
        YDDD format. This data indicates the date that the requisition was prepared. If this
        is not a valid YDDD date, the requisition is rejected with status code CD.
        3.3.2.6.4. The serial number portion of the document number must contain alphabetic
        and/or numeric characters. If any other type of character is found, the requisition is
        rejected with a CD status code.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                  77


        3.3.2.6.5. For a valid document number, the D035A document control and document
        history databases are searched for a possible duplicate value. If a match is found, the
        transaction is not processed any further and a reject status code is not returned to the
        customer. If an off-line requisition is called into the IM or their designated
        representative at two different AFMC ICPs and the same document number is entered
        into the separate D035A subsystems, the duplicate check does not stop this error from
        occurring. It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure that duplicate document
        numbers are not assigned to multiple requisitions.
     3.3.2.7. Demand Code or Suffix Code (rp 44). A demand code is used for DIC A0_
     transactions and a suffix code for DIC A3_ and A4_ transactions.
        3.3.2.7.1. If the transaction contains an invalid demand code, D035A changes it to an
        R for recurring. Demand codes are only significant to D035A in the following two
        situations:
           3.3.2.7.1.1. For a consumable item (ERRC is “N” or “P”), only requisitions with
           demand code R are considered when computing total demand for a quarter.
           3.3.2.7.1.2. For a recoverable item (ERRC “T”) where the AF is a SICA, if the
           item has a NIMSC 5 and the requisition contains demand code R, the transaction
           is not automatically passed to the PICA; rather, the requisition is suspended as a
           type “3F” controlled exception if there are no assets available to fill the order.
        3.3.2.7.2. Suffix codes are used to allow multiple, separate actions against a
        requisition and may not be reused for the same document number. This helps ensure
        duplicate shipments are not processed.
           3.3.2.7.2.1. If the transaction contains an invalid suffix code, D035A changes this
           to a blank character. Note: Assigning a blank character could result in a shipping
           request being denied simply because the suffix code was used before on a
           shipping request.
           3.3.2.7.2.2. Mechanical split shipment actions that are required to support a
           single requisition will be assigned an alpha suffix code beginning with A and
           ending with X, except for I, N, O, P, R and S. After suffix code W has been
           assigned, the document control record remains open; however, a BO will no
           longer exist. The document control record will show suffix code X, but attempts
           to action the document will result in a runtime error. When this situation occurs,
           contact the local D035A Site System OPR who will forward to SCS Help Desk
           for resolution.
     3.3.2.8. Supplementary Address . This field is only significant to D035A if an
     organization other than the one identified by the document number is to receive the
     materiel or is to receive the bill for the materiel.
        3.3.2.8.1. If the signal code indicates that the SUPADD is required (i.e., the signal
        code is “B,” “J” - “M, or “X”) and the document number contains a DoDAAC, the
        SUPADD must also contain a valid DoDAAC. If no matching DoDAAC record is
        found, the requisition is rejected with status code CX.
78                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


        3.3.2.8.2. If the document number contains a MAPAC, the SUPADD is required.
        For FMS requisitions, the SUPADD will be prepared IAW DLM 4000.25-1,
        paragraph C6.3.1.2.2.
     3.3.2.9. Signal Code. If this field does not contain a valid code, the requisition will be
     rejected with a CX status code.
     3.3.2.10. Fund Code. This field is required if the signal code contains a value other than
     D or M. Note: If D035A receives a non-capitalized customer requisition with signal
     code C or L, D035A validates the FC against a table maintained by D035J subsystem to
     identify the “bill-to” account.
     3.3.2.11. Distribution Code. This field is usually not required. Like the M&S code, the
     distribution code is used by DAAS to identify whom to provide an electronic copy of any
     supply (DIC AE3) or shipment (DIC AS3) status transaction generated during requisition
     processing. Any alphabetic or numeric or blank character is considered valid except as
     follows:
        3.3.2.11.1. If document number rp 30 contains a “D,” the distribution code must
        contain an “N” to ensure that SAMIS receives status transactions.
        3.3.2.11.2. On the D035A NEW screen, the distribution code field joins the
        distribution code with the System Designator Code (SDC) creating the appearance of
        a three-digit code (as defined in DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.12).
     3.3.2.12. SDC. This two-character field is usually not required; however, requisitions
     from D035K might contain a value of “0A,” while requisitions from SBSS usually
     contain a value of “01.” D035A processes do not use these two values. For the SDC to
     be significant to D035A, the field must contain a numeric value identified in AFH 23-
     123, Materiel Management Reference Information, Volume 1, Table 2.69.
     3.3.2.13. Project Code. This field is not a mandatory input for D035A. Although D035A
     does contain a database for storing all valid project codes, this data is for informational
     use only and is not used to edit the project code in a requisition. Reference DLM
     4000.25-1, Appendix 2.13 for a complete list of Office of the Secretary of Defense
     (OSD)/Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) assigned project codes and the HQ
     AFMC/A4RM Supply Chain Management SharePoint site for a AF project codes.
     3.3.2.14. Priority Designator. The combination of the priority designator and the
     Required Delivery Date (RDD) determines the supply and transportation system response
     time requirements. If an invalid priority designator is received, D035A uses priority
     designator 15. The priority designator is used by D035A when deciding which
     requisitions to fill and which requisitions to BO. Refer to paragraph 3.9 for details
     concerning SPRS and how the priority designator is used. Note: IMs will exercise
     restraint in assigning the priority to "FD" forced shipments. Shipping items priority 02,
     when priority 06 or lower will accomplish the mission, only results in expending
     unnecessary transportation dollars.
     3.3.2.15. Required Delivery Date. Normally, this contains numeric values that identify
     the Julian day of the year the materiel is required; however, there are other valid values
     for this field. For RDD descriptions, refer to DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.14.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                    79


       3.3.2.16. Advice Code. This field is not required. D035A does not edit to ensure it
       contains a valid value. Refer to DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.15 for a complete list of
       advice codes and their descriptions.
       3.3.2.17. Date of Requisition Receipt (rp 67-69). There are no edits applied to this three-
       character field established by D035A as part of initial processing.
       3.3.2.18. Purpose code. This field is not required on a customer requisition; however,
       for a manager-forced shipment action, it is a required entry on the NEW screen. Most
       requisitions received from a customer do not contain an O/P code; so, D035A assumes
       purpose code A. For a manager-forced shipment action from the NEW screen, the O/P
       code (A, K or 9) must be entered to identify the existing asset balance to be used.
       3.3.2.19. Supply Condition Code. This field is not required on a customer requisition;
       however, for a manager-forced shipment action, it is a required entry on the NEW screen.
       Most requisitions received from a customer do not contain a SCC, so D035A assumes
       SCC A; however, if project code 3BB is cited, then D035A assumes SCC F. For a
       manager-forced shipment action from the NEW screen, a valid SCC must be entered to
       identify the existing asset balance to be used.
       3.3.2.20. Management Code. This one-character field is not required on a customer
       requisition; however, for a manager-forced shipment action, it is vital that the correct
       management code be entered on the NEW screen. Reference DLM 4000.25-2, Appendix
       2.6 for DoD-assigned management codes and Table 3.3 for AF-specific.

         Loan Control Officer [LCO]) to work. See Chapter 8 for further details.
NOTE: For manager-forced shipment actions from the NEW screen, management codes will be
used to indicate the purpose of the shipment due to the effect on financial reporting.

       3.3.2.21. “From” RIC (rp 74-76). The originating subsystem uses its RIC for DIC A3_
       or A4_ transactions; however, D035A only considers this data as significant when it is
       processing a new GFM requisition. If the GFM requisition does not contain alphabetic
       and/or numeric characters in the “From” RIC, the requisition is rejected with status code
 80                                                    AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


      CL. The “From” RIC data is stored on the document record; however, it is not displayed
      on the DODA (Document Control Data) screen; instead, the data is recorded on
      transaction history and can be seen on the DODB (Transaction History Data) screen.
      3.3.2.22. “Ship-From” DoDAAC or RIC for Manager-Forced Shipments. When
      processing a requisition with a manager-forced shipment code (e.g., O1, O2, V1, V3 or
      VD), the transaction must contain either a ship-from DoDAAC (if shipping from an
      SBSS location) or a ship-from RIC (if shipping from a non-SBSS location). See Table
      3.4.

             Description
Origin
Ship-From    1. The last five characters of the SBSS ship-from DoDAAC (D035A defaults the
DoDAAC       first position to “F”) is split between rp 73 and 77-80 of the requisition.
             2. RP 73 must contain either a “B” or “E” and rp 77-80 must contain the last four
             characters from a valid SBSS DoDAAC.
             3. A type “4P” controlled exception message is returned to the NEW screen if the
             SBSS DoDAAC entered is not valid.
             4. Purpose code A must be used to avoid receiving a type “1S” exception
             message on the NEW screen.
             5. Only action codes “O1” and “O2” are valid when shipping from an SBSS
             location. The difference between these two codes is as follows:
             Action Code    Explanation
                            1. Action code indicates that a customer requirement is being
                            filled so D035A creates an issue transaction with DIC F7_ for
                            D035J.
                            2. The F7_ transaction, which can be viewed through the DODF
                            screen, is processed by D035J as a D6K transfer-in receipt
                            transaction and the appropriate issue transaction with DIC D7_
                            (i.e., a D7B if shipping an asset to an Army DoDAAC).
             O1
                            3. The D6K transaction is used to offset the D7K transfer-out
                            transaction created by SBSS for the financial subsystem when the
                            materiel is shipped by the base.
                            4. The “O1” code cannot be used to relocate base excess materiel
                            to a non-D035K wholesale storage activity DoDAAC, because
                            this would cause D035A to incorrectly instruct D035J to generate
                            a bill-to the wholesale storage activity receiving the materiel.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                   81


Shipment
            Description
Origin
                            1. Action code indicates that base excess materiel is being
                            relocated to a wholesale storage activity so D035A creates an F7_
                            issue transaction for D035J.
                            2. When the base ships the materiel, a D7K transfer-out
            O2              transaction is created by SBSS for the financial system.
                            3. When the materiel is received by the wholesale storage
                            activity, a D6K transfer-in transaction is created for D035J.
                            4. For RAMP-initiated release actions with “O2” action code,
                            D035A will not create an FY_ issue transaction for D035J.
Ship-From   1. The ship-from RIC is placed in rp 74-76 of the requisition.
RIC         2. If an invalid RIC is entered, a type “1F” controlled exception message is
            returned to the NEW screen.
            3. When shipping from a purpose code A balance or from a collocated ownership
            code 9 balance, the asset balance must be visible on the NSNC screen for the
            action to be successful.
            Action Code     Explanation
                            1. Action code indicates that a customer requirement is being
                            filled. It is only valid if shipping from an ownership code 9
                            balance maintained by D035K (i.e., the RIC is FGB, FHB or
                            FLB).
                            2. A type “1S” controlled exception message is returned to the
                            NEW screen if the “O1” code is used with any value other than
            O1              “9” in the O/P code.
                            3. If the purpose of the shipment is to relocate the materiel to
                            another wholesale storage activity, the “O1” code will not be used
                            even if shipping from an ownership code 9 balance to avoid the
                            creation of an invalid bill; instead, the “V3” action code will be
                            used to move the ownership code 9 balance. See Chapter 5 for
                            details regarding asset relocation.
                            1. Action code indicates that a customer requirement is being
                            filled. It is only valid if shipping from a purpose code A or K
                            balance.
            V1              2. A type “1S” controlled exception message is returned to the
                            NEW screen for any other value.
                            3. If the goal of the shipment is to relocate the materiel to another
                            wholesale storage activity, the “V1” code will not be used to
                            avoid the creation of an invalid bill; instead, the “V3” action code
82                                                        AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014

                              will be used to move the purpose code A or K balance.
                              1. Action code indicates that the materiel is being relocated to
                              another wholesale storage or repair activity.
              V3
                              2. This produces either a D7K or D7M transaction for D035J (for
                              a shipment to a repair contractor DoDAAC).
                              1. Action code indicates that the materiel is to be sent to the local
              VD              disposal activity.
                              2. This produces a D7J transaction for D035J.

     3.3.2.23. Estimated Shipping Date for manager-forced BOs (rp 73-76). When
     processing a requisition with a manager-forced BO code in rp 4-5 (i.e., B4, BZ or NP),
     the transaction must contain an ESD. The format of this date is YDDD. A type “5N”
     controlled exception message is returned to the NEW screen for a missing or invalid
     ESD.
  3.3.3. When D035A processes a requisition without an action code, there are five basic
  actions that D035A may take: pass, reject, release for shipment, suspend or BO (see Table
  3.5). For each action taken, D035A outputs an AE8 supply status transaction to DAAS.
  Refer to paragraph 3.21 for a detailed explanation of supply and shipment status processes.
     3.3.3.1. Pass all or part of the requisitioned quantity to another SOS or to the PICA.
     Additional details regarding passing actions are found in paragraph 3.4.2.2.2.3 A
     passing action occurs automatically for two reasons:
           3.3.3.1.1. D035A has determined that the correct SOS for the requisitioned item is
           not the processing D035A site.
           3.3.3.1.2. The processing D035A site is a SICA with a NIMSC 5 or 6 for the
           requisitioned item. Note: When a non-recurring requisition is received on a NIMSC
           5 item, a “3F” controlled exception is output for IM action. Additional guidance for
           PICA/SICA and NIMSC relationships is contained in AFMCR 400-21, Wholesale
           Inventory Management and Logistics Support of Multiservice Used Nonconsumable
           Items.
     3.3.3.2. Reject all or part of the requisitioned quantity. There are many reasons why
     D035A automatically rejects a requisition. Most are associated with transaction edits
     performed whenever a new requisition is received or whenever a new suffix code is
     established for an existing requisition. Reject status codes assigned by D035A are
     described in Table 3.5.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                        83


Table 3.5. Reject Status Codes
Code Description
       This reject code applies in the following scenarios:
       1. If the system attempts to create a “B4” BO when processing an AG6 transaction, the
       requisition is “CA” rejected if the management code on the requisition is A, B, C, D or E.
       These codes indicate the materiel was to be issued to a maintenance facility for assembly,
       disassembly, conversion or modification.
CA     2. If a D7_ issue reversal transaction is received from a depot retail system indicating a
       confirmed shipment was actually denied, D035A changes the status code of the affected
       suffix code from BA to CA. The system then attempts to reestablish the denied quantity
       on the next available suffix code; however, if the next available suffix code is X, the
       denied quantity is “CA” rejected on suffix code X.
       3. The requisitioned item has been assigned constant reject code “CA.” See Chapter 11
       for further details regarding asssignment of constant reject codes.
       This reject code applies in the following scenarios:
       1. For requisitions containing fill or kill advice codes, the system “CB” rejects any
       quantity not available for immediate release or not available by the RDD. Requisitions
       received for a P/N that contain advice codes 2C, 22 or 32 are “CB” rejected.
       1.1. Requisitions received with advice code 6Z are “CB” rejected based on the Routed
       Item Repair Quantity (RIRQ). Chapter 11 contains more information concerning this
       process.
       1.2. Requisitions received that contain advice codes 2C, 2J, 2W, 31, 32, 33, 6A, 6B, 6C
       or 6K are “CB” rejected if the system attempts to create a BO and the computed ESD is
       greater than the RDD.
       1.3. Requisitions received for an obsolete item (identified by phrase code “N”) are “CB”
CB
       rejected as follows:
       1.3.1. For a bachelor item, the requisition is “CB” rejected if the advice code is 2C, 2J,
       22, 31, 32, 33 or 6K.
       1.3.2. For an item that is part of an I&SG, the requisition is “CB” rejected if the advice
       code is 2J, 31, 33 or 6B.
       2. Requisitions with project code 3AA (indicating pre-positioned war reserve materiel
       stock, consumable item requirements) are “CB” rejected if assets could not be released to
       fill the order (i.e., no BO is created).
       3. If clearing “9G” controlled exception (reparable assets available) for a Materiel
       Utilization Control Office (MUCO) requisition and no assets are available, the
       requisition is “CB” rejected.
       This code is assigned to reject a requisition where one or more of the following is true:

Code Description
      2. Document number serial number is invalid
      3. Quantity field is invalid.
      This code is assigned to reject a requisition with an invalid UI that cannot be

      automatically corrected by D035A.
      1. This code is assigned to reject a requisition for an item that is part of an I&SG and is
      assigned OOU code “ZZZ.”
CG    2. It indicates that AF has no retail use of the item; however, AF manages the item for
      use by other Service customers because of the item’s relationship with others in the
      I&SG.
      This reject code applies in the following scenarios:
      1. Requisitioned item is not managed in D035A:
      1.1. FMS Single Vendor Integrity Contract (SVIC) Direct Vendor Delivery (DVD)
      requisition.
      1.2. Requisition with a FC that contains zeroes or spaces.
      1.3. Requisition for an item transferred to DLA after the requisition was released for
      shipment and D035A then attempts to create a “B4” BO when processing an AG6
CH    shipper response transaction.
      1.4. Requisition from other than AF FMS customer (i.e., service code D) for item
      transferred to GSA as indicated by PSC E.
      2. Requisitioned item has been assigned constant reject code “CH.” Note: An FMS
      requisition is not rejected; instead, D035A suspends it as a “4T” controlled exception
      (FMS requisition for item with “CH” constant reject assigned). See Chapter 8 for
      controlled exception processing. See Chapter 11 for further details regarding
      asssignment of constant reject codes.
      This reject code applies in the following scenarios:
      1. This code is assigned when an obsolete item (identified by phrase code “N”) is
      requisitioned:
      1.1. For a bachelor item, if the advice code does not equal 2C, 2F, 2J, 22, 25, 31, 32, 33
      or 6K, the requisition is immediately “CJ” rejected; otherwise the system attempts to fill
      the requisition. If no assets are available, the requisition is “CJ” rejected unless the
CJ    advice code is 2F or 25, which causes D035A to BO the requisition.
      1.2. For an item that is part of an I&SG, the requisition is immediately “CJ” rejected if
      the advice code is 2B, 24, 26, 34, or 39; otherwise, the system attempts to fill the
      requisition. If no assets are available, the requisition is “CJ” rejected unless the advice
      code is 2F or 25, which causes D035A to BO the requisition.
      2. The requisitioned item has been assigned constant reject code “CJ.” See Chapter 11
      for further details regarding asssignment of constant reject codes. Note: D035A will not
      reject a requisition with advice code 2F or 25 (indicating the customer knows the item is

Code Description
      obsolete but is still required).
      This code is assigned to reject a contractor GFM requisition when both the distribution
CL    code and “From” RIC fields are spaces, which indicates the requisition was not first
      submitted to the MCA.
      This reject code applies in the following scenarios:
      1. If the signal code is C or L and the FC is not valid, the requisition is “CM” rejected.
      2. If it is a contractor requisition for a DLA-managed item and the FC contains zeroes or
      spaces, the requisition is “CM” rejected.
CM    3. If the requisition is for a BC “Z” item and the constant reject code is not “CH,” the
      requisition is “CM” rejected.
      4. If the FC is “4F” but the requisition is not from an AF FMS customer, it is “CM”
      rejected.
      5. If the signal code is not C or L for a repair contractor GFM requisition, the requisition
      is “CM” rejected.
      For an LM item (i.e., AAC L or the SOS RIC is JCL), the requisition is “CP” rejected
CP    rather than backordered if the RDD does not equal “999” (expedited handling signal) or
      begin with “E” or “N” and the advice code is not 2A, 25, or 3B.
      For consumable items, the system may use status code CS to reject requisitioned
      quantities above the MRQ.
      1. Status code CSwill not be used on the BOAB screen to cancel a BO.
      2. For requisitions containing advice code 2L or 22” the MRQ edit is bypassed;
      however, for FMS requisitions, the quantity above the MRQ is output on a “9M”
      controlled exception (Quantity Exceeds Minimum Release Quantity). See Chapter 8 for
CS
      further details.
      3. For requisitions containing advice code 21, 23, 26, 27, 28 or 33, the MRQ edit is
      bypassed; however, for FMS requisitions, the quantity above the MRQ is placed on “BZ”
      BO status with the ASI equal to four asterisks (****).
      4. For requisitions containing other advice codes or no advice code, the quantity above
      the MRQ is “CS” rejected.
      For an obsolete item identified by AAC Y, the requisition is “CU” rejected if the advice
CU
      code is not 2B, 24, 26, 34 or 39 and there are no assets available.
      This reject code applies in the following scenarios:
      1. If the ship-to DoDAAC, bill-to DoDAAC or signal code is invalid, the requisition is
      “CX” rejected.
CX
      2. If the credit indicator is “A,” indicating the AF is in a buy position for the NSN, a
      requisition for a consumable item with a MUCO document number is “CX” rejected.
      3. If the signal code is D or M (i.e., free issue) or the FC contains zeroes or spaces for a

Code Description
      MUCO requisition, the requisition is “CX” rejected.
      4. If the signal code is D or M, and the purpose code is other than K (purpose code K
      indicates a loan request), for a requisition from a non-capitalized customer (i.e., not an
      SBSS or depot retail customer), the requisition is “CX” rejected.
      5. If the signal code is D or M and the SCC is A, B or C for a requisition from a DMISA
      repair activity, the requisition is “CX” rejected.
      6. If the management code is J (sell at exchange price) for a contractor requisition for a
      consumable item, the requisition is “CX” rejected.
      For an obsolete item identified by AAC Y, the requisition is “CY” rejected for advice
CY
      codes 2B, 24, 26, 34 or 39 if no assets are available.
      1. When D035A receives a GFM requisition from a contractor, the requisition is
      suspended as a “34” controlled exception (MCA Must Validate Requisition) and an ICP
      GFM validation request (DIC AX1) is sent to the MCA for GFM validation purposes.
      See Chapter 8 for further details regarding controlled exception processing.
      2. If D035A receives a MCA GFM validation response (DIC AX2) with advice code 2U
DB    back from the MCA, the system “DB” rejects the requisition.
      3. The “34” controlled exception is deleted and status code DB is forwarded to the
      customer and the MCA.
      4. The DIC AX2 transaction is recorded to D035A transaction history, but a cancellation
      request (DIC AC3) with status code DB is not recorded to history.
      1. When D035A receives a GFM requisition from a contractor, the requisition is
      suspended as a “34” controlled exception and a DIC AX1 is sent to the MCA for GFM
      validation purposes. See Chapter 8 for further details regarding controlled exception
      processing.
      2. If D035A receives a DIC AX2 with advice code 2R from the MCA, the system “DJ”
DJ    rejects the quantity on the AX2 transaction and any remaining quantity is processed on
      the next available suffix code.
      3. The “34” controlled exception is deleted and status code DJ is forwarded to the
      customer and the MCA.
      4. The AX2 transaction is recorded to D035A transaction history, but an AC3
      transaction with a status code DJ is not recorded to history.
      1. When D035A receives a GFM requisition from a contractor, the requisition is
      suspended as a “34” controlled exception and DIC AX1 is sent to the MCA for GFM
      validation purposes. See Chapter 8 for further details regarding controlled exception
DN    processing.
      2. If D035A receives DIC AX2 with advice code 2V from the MCA, the system “DN”
      rejects the requisition.
      3. The “34” controlled exception is deleted and status code DN is forwarded to the

      3. The “34” controlled exception is deleted and status code DQ is forwarded to the
      customer and the MCA.

      validation purposes. See Chapter 8 for further details regarding controlled exception
      processing.
      2. D035A automatically “DR” cancels a GFM requisition if DIC AX2 is not received
DR    from the MCA 16 days after the creation of the “34” controlled exception and outbound
      DIC AX1.
      3. The “34” controlled exception is deleted and status code DR is forwarded to the
      customer and the MCA.
      4. DIC AC3 with status code DR is not recorded to D035A transaction history.
      A requisition from an SBSS customer can be cancelled by the system with status code
      FB.
      1. Status code FB will not be used on the BOAB screen to cancel a BO.
      2. When a priority 04-15 requisition is received from an SBSS customer, D035A checks
      to see if RAMP reported base excess for the base DoDAAC and NSN combination. If it
      has, then the requisition is “FB” cancelled.

      3. When a base excess overlay “ZBE” transaction is received from RAMP, D035A
      checks to see if there are any priority 04-15 BOs for the base DoDAAC and NSN
      combination. If any of these BOs are found, the BO is “FB” cancelled.
      4. When excess report (DIC FTE) is received from an SBSS customer, D035A checks to
      see if there are any priority 04-15 BOs for the base DoDAAC and NSN combination. If
      any of these BOs are found, they are “FB” cancelled.

        2. FC GR, HR or LR is used on a requisition that is not a repair contractor GFM
        requisition.
        1. This code is assigned for SBSS requisitions for depot overhaul items (i.e.,
        maintenance code “3” items).
        2. D035A will “FM” reject unless:
FM
        2.1. RDD is 999 or
        2.2. RDD begins with “E” or “N” or
        2.3. Project code is 122, 123 or 3AA.

        3.3.3.3. Release for shipment all or part of the requisitioned quantity. The process used
        by D035A to select a ship-from location is described in paragraph 3.11.
        3.3.3.4. Suspend the requisition as a controlled exception for manager review and action.
        Refer to Chapter 8 for details concerning controlled exception processes.
        3.3.3.5. BO all or part of the requisitioned quantity. D035A creates a BO for the
        following four reasons:
            3.3.3.5.1. The IM has assigned a restrictive MRC to the requisitioned item. Refer to
            Chapter 11 for details concerning MRC processes.
            3.3.3.5.2. If the requisitioned quantity were to be shipped, the remaining on-hand
            asset balance would drop below an assigned level. Refer to Chapter 11 for details
            concerning levels processes.
            3.3.3.5.3. There are no on-hand assets available to fill the requisition.
            3.3.3.5.4. D035A found a manager-forced BO with a higher priority.
3.4. Follow-on Requisition Processing.
     3.4.1. Controlled Exceptions. D035A suspends requisitions as controlled exceptions
     awaiting manual review and action. Each type of controlled exception is identified by a two-
     character type exception code. See Chapter 8 for detailed guidance in working controlled
     exceptions. The type exception codes applicable to initial requisition processing are as
     follows: 1P, 1S-1U, 2Q, 3A, 3C, 3F, 3K, 3X, 34, 4A, 4G, 4P, 4S, 4T, 5L-5N, 5P, 6C, 6E,
     6P, 6V, 7F, 7I, 7K, 7L, 7N, 8H, 9A, 9C-9M, 9P and 9S.
     3.4.2. Backorder Processing.
        3.4.2.1. Backorder Status Codes. There are six status codes used by D035A to manage
        BOs; detailed in Table 3.6.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                       89


Table 3.6. Backorder Status Codes
Code Description
BB    Requisition on BO due to levels, lack of assets or a higher priority backorder exists.
B4    Requisition forced on BO by IM Action. These are only releasable by the IM.
B5    Requisition forced on BO by restrictive MRC. These are only releasable by the IM.
      Requisition is on contract for DVD. A backorder will first be placed in “BZ” status and
      then, after off-line confirmation is received that the DVD request can be supported; the
      BO will be updated to show status code BV.
      1. If the materiel is to be shipped from a contractor production facility or from another
      DoD ICP, the D035A IUTC or IUTD screen can be used to see if the DVD action has
      been loaded into the J018R system.
      1.1. When the materiel is shipped, the local procurement organization must be notified
      so that the shipment action is recorded in the J018R system.
      1.2. On a weekly basis, D035A receives “ZK_” shipment notification transactions from
      J018R.
      1.3. The D035A CFDA screen can be used to enter a “ZK_” transaction directly into
      D035A; however, the IM must be careful to assign the correct DIC: “ZKS” for a
      shipment from a contractor production facility or “ZKU” for a shipment from another
BV    DoD ICP.
      2. If the materiel is to be shipped from a contractor repair facility, it is important to
      know which data system is being used by the contractor to manage the repair work.
      2.1. If the repair work is reported through the G009 system, then the IM is responsible
      for posting a “ZKM” transaction using the CFDA screen once the materiel has been
      shipped.2.2. If the repair work is reported through the AF Commercial Asset Visibility
      (CAV-AF) system, CAV-AF outputs a transaction with DIC D7_ to show the
      shipment.2.3. This issue transaction is processed as a “ZKM” transaction by D035A; so,
      the IM will not use the CFDA screen to post a duplicate “ZKM” transaction.
      3. If the materiel is to be shipped from a government repair facility, it is important to
      know if this repair facility is reporting asset balances to D035A.3.1. If it does not, the
      IM is responsible for posting a “ZKM” transaction using the CFDA screen once the
      materiel has been shipped.3.2. If it does, the DVD process must not be used by the IM to
      post shipments.
      Requisition is being processed for DVD. If a requisition is on BO due to insufficient on-
      hand assets, the IM will consider using the DVD process to fill the order. The DVD
      process may be used to ship materiel from a contractor production facility, from a
BZ    contractor repair facility, from a government repair facility or from another DoD ICP. It
      must only be used to ship materiel from a government repair facility that does not report
      asset balances to D035A. The BO will first be placed into “BZ” status and, when
      confirmation is received that the materiel can be shipped directly to the customer, then
      the BO will be placed into status code BV. Because using the DVD process reduces

      1. If the decision is made to use the DVD process to ship materiel from a contractor
      production facility or from another DoD ICP:1.1. If no current due-in to supply exists,
      the IM must:
      1.1.1. Prepare a Purchase Request (PR) or a Military Inter-departmental Purchase
      Request (MIPR) with ISI to the local procurement organization IAW AFMCI 23-102,
      Purchase Request (PR)/Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR)
      Operations.
      1.1.2. Change BO status code to BZ.
      1.2. If a current due-in to supply does exist, the IM must:
      1.2.1. Contact the local procurement organization to validate the delivery date for the
      due-in and to assure that ASI can be accepted prior to delivery.
      1.2.2. Change BO to status code BZ after the ASI paperwork has been submitted to the
      local procurement organization.
      1.3. The DVD action must be loaded by the local procurement organization into the
      J018R system, which provides a daily overlay of its contract master file to D035A.
      1.3.1. Use the IUTC and IUTD screens to display the contract master file by contract
      number, document number or stock number.
      1.3.2. If the DVD action cannot be found in D035A, the IM must follow up with the
      local procurement organization to ensure data is entered into the J018R system.
      1.4. If for some reason the DVD action must be cancelled, the cancellation must be
      entered into the J018R system by the local procurement organization.
      1.4.1. D035A then receives a “ZP_” transaction from J018R to confirm that the DVD
      action has been stopped.
      1.4.2. The D035A TRM screen may also be used to enter a “ZP_” transaction directly
      into D035A to change the BO status code from BZ to BB or B4; however, this action
      does not update J018R.
      2. If the decision is made to use the DVD process to ship materiel from a contractor
      repair facility, provide the assigned Production Management Specialist (PMS) the
      ASI/ISI information.
      2.1. DVD shipments from a contractor repair facility are not normally loaded into the
      J018R system.
      2.2. CAV-AF generates and issue (DIC D7_) indicating shipment to support a BO
      provided to the contractor via ASI/ISI procedures. The Enterprise Application
      Integration (EAI) module through which transactions are passed from CAV-AF to
      D035A also converts the D7_ transaction to a “ZKM” shipment confirmation and sends
      it along with the D7_ transaction to D035A.
      3. If the decision is made to use the DVD process to ship materiel from a government

Code Description
      repair facility, the appropriate interservice Point of Contact (POC) must receive the
      ASI/ISI information. DVD shipments from a government repair facility are not normally
      loaded into the J018R system.
NP    Requisition is a non-programmed requirement.

     3.4.2.2. Backorder Actions. It is possible to release, cancel, pass or modify BOs either
     by NSN or document number.
         3.4.2.2.1. Backorder Actions by NSN. Use the BOAE screen to action selected BOs
         by interrogating individual NSNs. Type one of the following action codes next to the
         pertinent BO row and press “Enter” to go to a corresponding BOA action screen for
         continued processing: “A” - Release (BOAA), “B” – Cancel/Pass (BOAB), “C” -
         Modify (BOAC), “D” - Mod Action (BOAD). Type “E” (pre-positioning change)
         will be prompted for input of “T” for total or “1” through “9” for the quantity to be
         pre-positioned.
         3.4.2.2.2. Backorder Actions by Document Number.
            3.4.2.2.2.1. Release for Shipment. See Table 3.7 for further details.

Table 3.7. Release for Shipment Processes
Type Release         Description
Automated Release    If no other coding is applied which would restrict D035A initiating
of Backorders for    automatic movement of assets (e.g., requisition is backordered with status
Shipment Release     code B5 IAW use of a restrictive MRC on the applicable item), D035A
Backorder (RBO).     can generate RDOs to ship assets to fill BOs.
                     1. Upon an increase to serviceable materiel on-hand, a decrease to stock
                     levels or a change to certain catalogue management data, D035A
                     automatically processes an RBO transaction to attempt to ship materiel.
                     2. The first step in this process is to sort all BOs into the desired release
                     order. Paragraph 3.9 explains how D035A uses both the UMMIPS and
                     SPRS to decide which BOs will be released.
Manual Release of    1. Standard/Preferred Process. The purpose of the BOAA screen is to
Backorders for       allow a user to manually release materiel to ship-from stock to fill BOs
Shipment             with status code BB, B4, B5 or NP.
                     1.1. For any portion of the BO not filled, D035A creates another BO on
                     the next available suffix code using the original BO status code.
                     1.2. This option cannot be used in the following two circumstances:
                     1.2.1. BO are pre-positioned for release from a non-collocated D035K
                     site.
                     1.2.2. Non-programmed BOs have an extended RDD that begins with
                     “S.”
                     1.3. The allowable action codes that can be entered on this screen are
                     found in Table 3.8.
                     2. Alternate/Rare Processes. The circumstances under which it is
                     appropriate to initiate a shipment outside of D035A to fill a customer BO
                     are very rare. This action will only be taken when no other options are
                     available and must be documented sufficiently to provide a complete
                     audit trail.
                     2.1. Release Initiated in D035K.
                     2.1.1. IMs can request that depot RIMs input a “Y5_” automated
                     shipment request directly into D035K to fill a wholesale customer
                     requisition; however, such action creates the following problems:
                     2.1.1.1. The applicable BO is not removed from D035A (or the system
                     has no record of the order at all). There is potential for D035A to
                     automatically release additional assets for shipment against BOs that have
                     already been supported. Because the requisition is not in open shipment
                     (BA) status, D035A will suspend any “BL_” shipment confirmations
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                             93


Type Release    Description
                received from D035K on type “4N” or “4H” controlled exceptions. These
                exceptions must be manually worked by the IM.
                2.1.1.2. D035K does not advise D035A regarding a change in wholesale
                asset position. D035A asset balances will be incorrect until the nightly
                reconciliation with D035K. There is potential for D035A to
                automatically attempt to release non-existent assets to support valid
                customer requisitions. If a depot supply retail-owned asset is used to
                support the requirement, there are no impacts on the wholesale asset
                balances reported to D035A.
                2.1.1.3. D035K generates an invalid issue transaction to D035J thereby
                adversely impacting the AF financial statement.
                2.1.1.4. Neither D035A nor D035K communicates appropriate stock
                balance and consumption data to D200A.
                2.1.1.5. Excluding D035A from this shipment process may violate
                official release prioritization and removes any opportunity for the system
                to apply mandatory edits.
                2.1.2. The rare circumstances under which input of a “Y5_” automated
                shipment request directly into D035K is authorized are as follows:
                2.1.2.1. If the shipping D035K system is collocated with D035A and if
                the asset to be shipped is owned by a depot RIM, then using the D035K
                RQIH screen to input an “Y5_” transaction is allowed so long as D035A
                records are then updated to reflect the shipment. Either D035A OPRs or
                Customer Support Center personnel must use the D035A BBA screen to
                change the BO from status code BB to an open BA status.
                2.1.2.2. If the shipping D035K and D035A subsystems are not collocated
                and the communication link between the two is interrupted, it may be
                necessary to use the D035K RQIE screen to input a RDO transaction. In
                this situation, it is still required that D035A be updated to show the
                shipment request by entering action code O1 and by answering “No” to
                the “Output MRO/RDO?” prompt.
                2.1.2.3. Unfortunately a problem often occurs when the depot retail
                activity supports a lateral request from an AF base retail activity. If the
                requesting base establishes the retail due-in improperly, the SBSS may
                generate a requisition follow-up (DIC AT_) to D035A erroneously. This
                follow up transaction will create a new requisition in D035A; however,
                the base has already received the materiel through lateral support so that
                there is no automated attempt by the retail activity to cancel the BO in
                D035A. The only indication that this has occurred is when D035A
                receives a materiel receipt acknowledgement (DIC DRA) transaction for a
                requisition still in BO status. The only option is to cancel the requisition
                in D035A with cancellation status code BQ and to delete the DRA

               transaction suspended as a “4H” controlled exception.
               1.2. Release Initiated in DSS.
               1.2.1. IMs can request that storage site personnel input a MRO into DSS
               rather than take action that allows D035A to automatically send DSS an
               MRO. This action is commonly referred to as a “super MRO.”
               1.2.2. Cautions and Restrictions.
               1.2.2.1. Under no circumstances will customers (i.e., OS/A, Program
               Management Offices, ESs, Engineers, etc.), be permitted to make such
               requests without involving an approved authority within the wholesale
               item management community (e.g., IM).
               1.2.2.2. There appears to be a misconception that the use of this so-called
               “super MRO” process results in expedited shipment. This is not the case.
               D035A operates in an online and real-time environment. At most, it will
               take only a couple of hours for a D035A-generated MRO to reach the
               appointed DSS. DSS operates in an end-of-day batch processing
               environment and is not prompted by manual intervention to process any
               earlier or more frequently.
               1.2.2.3. The relatively minor time savings achieved by using a “super
               MRO” to enter a shipment request into DSS is far outweighed by the
               consequences of leaving D035A out of the process. They are as follows:
               1.2.2.3.1. DLA charges an additional handling fee for manual inputs to
               DSS.
               1.2.2.3.2. Excluding D035A from this shipment process may violate
               official release prioritization and removes any opportunity for the system
               to apply mandatory edits.
               1.2.2.3.3. Applicable BOs are either not removed from D035A or the
               system has no record of the orders at all. There is potential for D035A to
               automatically release additional assets for shipment against BOs that have
               already been supported. Because requisitions are not in open-shipment
               (BA) status, D035A will suspend any “BL_” or “AR_” shipment
               confirmations received from either DSS or D035K on a “4N” or “4H”
               controlled exception. These controlled exceptions must be manually
               worked by the IM.
               1.2.2.3.4. The D035A asset balance will be incorrect until its
               reconciliation with either DSS or D035K. There is potential for D035A
               to automatically attempt to release non-existent assets to support valid
               customer requisitions.
               1.2.2.3.5. Neither D035A nor D035K generates an issue transaction to
               the D035J. This means that D035J does not create a bill when the asset
               was shipped to a non-capitalized customer such as an Other Service. The

Type Release           Description
                       D035J asset balance is also incorrect until its monthly reconciliation with
                       either D035A or D035K.
                       1.2.2.3.6. D035A and D035K cannot communicate appropriate stock
                       balance and consumption data to D200A.
                       1.2.2.3.7. Because of the potential for fraud, waste and abuse in the
                       “super MRO” process, a limited number of wholesale personnel who are
                       authorized to request direct input of MROs into DSS (e.g., IMs and their
                       management chain) must be designated locally. All such requests must be
                       in writing and signed by a center-designated approving authority.
                       1.2.3. The only two appropriate uses for this “super MRO” process are as
                       follows:
                       1.2.3.1. If the communications link between D035A and the shipping
                       system is interrupted, it may be necessary to use the “super MRO”
                       process. In this situation, the IM must still update D035A to show the
                       shipment request by entering the correct action code (i.e., “O1,” “V1” or
                       “V3”) and by answering “No” to the “Output MRO/RDO?” prompt.
                       1.2.3.2. If special shipping instructions apply, DIC A5E or A55 MRO is
                       generated by D035A and the IM must provide DSS with the applicable
                       narrative information. In this case, D035A still sends the shipping request
                       to DSS mechanically; however, the additional text information is not
                       included in the transmission, so it must be provided via person-to-person
                       contact.

             3.4.2.2.2.2. Cancel. Requisitions that are not rejected during initial processing are
             still subject to at least one of three follow-on cancellation actions: Customer-
             requested cancellation; IM manual cancellation; or D035A AFMC Lead
             Functional OPR manual mass cancellation. Note: There are no differences in the

                 3.4.2.2.2.2.1. Customer-Requested Cancellation. The customer can request
                 cancellation of all or part of a requisitioned quantity via either generation of
                 DIC AC1 off-line communication (see paragraph 3.4.2.2.2.2.2). Requisition
                 cancellation (DIC AC_) transactions are normally received from customers
                 via interface with DAAS into D035A (third position of the AC_ will be “1,”
                 “2” or “3”); however, for depot retail customers located at the same ALC,
                 DIC AC_ transactions are received through a direct interface with D035K
                 (third position of the AC_ is always “1”). See Table 3.9 for further details.
                 See Table 3.23 for DICs used in cancelling open shipments (includes follow-
                 up and response transactions: AC6, AE_, AG6, AK6, AU0, AUA and AUB).
                 Key fields in cancellation transactions are edited by D035A for valid data
                 entries as shown in Table 3.10 and then action taken based on requisition
                 status as shown in Table 3.11.

Table 3.10. D035A Edits on Customer-Requested Cancellations
Type Edit              Scenario and Action
                       If the document number on the AC_ transaction does not match a
                       D035A requisition record, the system edits the document number
                       elements and determines SOS for the NSN reflected.
                       1. If the document number contains an invalid DoDAAC, Julian date
Document Number        or serial number, status code CD is forwarded to the customer.
                       2. If another activity is the SOS for the item, DIC AC_ is passed to
                       the correct SOS and status code BM is furnished to the customer.
                       3. If the processing D035A is the SOS for the item, status code BF is
                       forwarded to the customer.
                       1. If the suffix code is an invalid character (e.g., contains demand
                       code N or R), it is replaced with a blank.
                       2. If the suffix code is a valid, non-blank character, but no matching
                       D035A requisition record is found for the document number and
                       suffix code combination, the AC_ transaction is suspended as a “4N”
                       controlled exception (Transaction Mismatched to Trailer Record
                       Data). Because this controlled exception cannot be worked to apply
                       cancellation to a different suffix, the IM must delete the controlled
                       exception then use the BOAB screen to manually cancel the
                       appropriate suffix code(s). See Chapters 8 and 13 for further details
Document Number        regarding controlled exception and BOAB screen processing.
Suffix Code
                       3. If the suffix code is blank and D035A has assigned a suffix code
                       to the requisition, then the suffix code on the AC_ transaction is set
                       equal to the suffix code found on the first backorder record for the
                       document number.
                       3.1. If DIC AC_ quantity is less than or equal to the first BO
                       quantity, no additional processing occurs.
                       3.2. If DIC AC_ quantity field is greater than the first backordered
                       quantity, the system will first look for additional BO records to
                       cancel. If none are found, the system then looks for open BA”
                       shipment status codes to cancel.
                       1. If the UI does not match the UI on the D035A item record, an
                       attempt is made to convert the UI and quantity fields.
UI
                       2. If the UI cannot be converted or is invalid or the quantity is not
                       numeric, status code CD is forwarded to the customer.

Table 3.13. IM Manual Cancellation Status Codes
Code DIC     Description
             Use of status code BQ is authorized only under two circumstances:
             1. Customer has requested cancellation but cannot submit a cancellation
             transaction mechanically.
             2. IM has obtained customer concurrence with cancellation.
BQ     AC1   Note 1: Status code BQ provided to the customer by D035A will not close the
             retail due-in record if the customer does not update their records to indicate the
             off-line cancellation request.
             Note 2: It is imperative that the IM include the name, office symbol, phone
             number of the customer plus a meaningful description of why the BO was
             cancelled on the IUTU Clear Text input as part of the cancellation action.
C7     AC3   Exception narrative text not received.
             Use of cancellation status code CA is authorized only if no other cancellation
             code is applicable.
             1. Valid reasons for using status code CA.
             1.1. Due to limitations in available remaining suffix codes, the IM may be
             required to “CA” cancel the B1.2. Safety of flight or a quality deficiency
             situation has been identified but the appropriate constant reject code was not
             applied prior to receiving the backorder.Note 1: The wholesale IM will follow-
             up with the customer to provide the reason for cancellation. Status code CA will
             not close the retail due-in record if the customer does not update their records to
             indicate the off-line cancellation request.
             Note 2: It is imperative that the IM record the name, office symbol, phone
CA     AC3
             number of the customer plus a meaningful description of why the BO was
             cancelled on an IUTU Clear Text input as part of the cancellation process.
             2. Invalid reasons for using status code CA.
             2.1. IMs must not “CA” cancel a BO if it is determined the customer obtained
             the materiel through lateral support; instead, the IM must use status code BQ to
             cancel the requisition. It is probable that the customer due-in record has already
             been deleteb.
             2.2. IMs must not “CA” cancel a BO if the IM supported the customer through
             an off-line shipment. The IM must post the appropriate shipment action.
             Cancelling the BO due to an off-line shipment neither records an audit trail for
             the inventory drop nor does it generate any financial updates (e.g., billing).

             during initial processing, an IM can cancel the BO with status code CB if the item

          3.4.2.2.2.3. Users will not pass requisitions on items with an alpha BC. For items
          with a numeric BC (e.g., “8” or “9”), users can pass requisitions on BO with
          status codes BB, B4, B5 or NP status (i.e., other than BZ or BV) via the BOAB
          screen. See paragraph 13.4.4 for a passing action format.
             3.4.2.2.2.3.1. Passing action is authorized only under the following
             circumstances:
               3.4.2.2.2.3.1.1. When a requisition has been submitted to the incorrect ICP
               for the NSN.
               3.4.2.2.2.3.1.2. When the AFMC ICP is the SICA, another OS/A is the
               PICA and the AF SICA has no serviceable assets available for shipment.
               3.4.2.2.2.3.1.3. When a nonrecurring requisition is received on a NIMSC 5
               item. D035A will output a “3F” controlled exception for action as outlined
               in Chapter 8.
             3.4.2.2.2.3.2. Stock List Change. When prime logistics responsibility is
             transferred from an AFMC ICP to another AFMC ICP or to another OS/A,
             selected BOs will be automatically passed to the gaining ICP (transaction with
             DIC A3_) via DAAS.
          3.4.2.2.2.4. Modify. Certain data elements of a BO can be modified using one of
          three methods: Process an inbound DIC AM_ transaction; use online access to
          emulate receipt of DIC AM_ (RQM screen); or use online access to directly
          modify BO data (BOAA, BOAB, BOAC, BOAD, BOAE, BOAF and TRM
          screens). See Chapter 13 for sample formats. See Table 3.15 for a cross
          reference between data elements and the screens that can be used to modify them.
          Note: Modifier transactions/online updates are authorized for GFM requisitions
          only to modify the project code, priority designator, advice code and the RDD.

                   backordered requisition can be modified through the submission of a
                   transaction with DIC AM_ to D035A. Normally, the requisitioning activity
                   modifies the due-in information in their retail data system to generate a DIC
                   AM_ transaction that is passed through DAAS to the appropriate D035A
                   subsystem. Table 3.16 details D035A edits on inbound requisition modifier
                   transactions.

Table 3.16. Edits on Inbound Requisition Modifier Transactions
Scenario          Edits
AM_ Transaction   Document number date is compared to the current processing date
Matches No        1. For a modifier from an AF organization (i.e., the document number
Requisition       begins with “F”), if the document number date is within 120 days of the
Record            current processing date, the transaction is processed as a requisition with
                  DIC A0_. For all other types of customers, if the document number date is
                  within 180 days of the current processing date, the transaction is processed
                  as a requisition with DIC A0_ or, for an AF FMS document number, as a
                  referral order transaction with DIC A4_.
                  2. If the document number date is not within the required 120 or 180 days
                  of the current processing date, D035A returns a supply status transaction
                  with status code BF (No record of your document for which your modifier
                  request was submitted) to DAAS for delivery to the customer.
AM_ Transaction   1. If the matching requisition is closed, D035A returns a supply status
Matches           transaction with status code B2(status of supply or procurement action
Requisition       precludes requested modification) to DAAS for delivery to the customer.
Record            2. If the matching requisition is open:
                  2.1. All the fields on the AM_ transaction are edited for valid values. The
                  same edits performed for a requisition are used; however, if D035A detects
                  an error, the AM_ transaction is not suspended as a controlled exception.
                  Instead, D035A returns a supply status transaction with a D7_ supply status
                  (Requisition modifier rejected because of errors in one or more data
                  elements) to DAAS for delivery to the customer.
                  2.2. If the AM_ transaction passed all edits, the current requisition status in
                  D035A determines what action is taken. The document number suffix code
                  on the AM_ transaction is used by D035A to retrieve a requisition record.
                  2.2.1. If the requisition is on a controlled exception (i.e., in “BD” status),
                  the controlled exception data is updated and a supply status transaction with
                  status code BD (requisition is delayed due to need to verify requirements
                  relative to authorized application, item identification or technical data) is
                  sent to DAAS for delivery to the customer; however, for a contractor GFM
                  requisition suspended for MCA approval (i.e., in “BD” status with a type
                  “34” exception code), a AM_ requisition modifier transaction is not
                  processed by D035A.
                  2.2.2. If the requisition status code is BA and there is a posted shipment
                  confirmation transaction, a shipment status transaction is sent to DAAS for
                  delivery to the customer. If the requisition status code is BA and there is no
                  posted shipment confirmation transaction, a supply status transaction with
                  status code BA (Item being processed for release and shipment) is sent to
                  DAAS for delivery to the customer. For any open quantity (i.e., neither

Scenario            Edits
                    confirmed nor denied by the shipper), D035A does not pass a modifier
                    transaction to the shipping activity to update the shipping request data even
                    though the requisition data in D035A is updated and a Supply Status
                    transaction with status code BK (modified) is sent to DAAS for delivery to
                    the customer.
                    2.2.3. If the requisition status code is BV or BZ, the requisition data in
                    D035A is updated and a supply status transaction with status code BK is
                    sent to DAAS for delivery to the customer. If the AM_ transaction
                    modified the SUPADD, a notice is created for the IM showing a transaction
                    with DIC AMF. If the AM_ transaction modified the RDD, a notice is
                    created for the IM showing a transaction with DIC AMP. No interface
                    exists for D035A to feed requisition data changes to a procurement system;
                    therefore, the IM must contact the appropriate procurement POC to have the
                    data updated in the procurement system.
                    2.2.4. If the requisition status code is BB, B4, B5 or NP, the requisition
                    data in D035A is updated and a supply status transaction with status code
                    BK is sent to DAAS for delivery to the customer. If the AM_ transaction
                    changed the RDD so that it no longer begins with “S,” then D035A no
                    longer considers the requisition as non-programmed (i.e., the BO status
                    code is changed from NP to BB). However, if the AM_ transaction changed
                    the RDD so that it does begin with “S,” then D035A now considers the
                    requisition as non-programmed.
                    2.3. If the requisition priority has been increased (e.g., changed from 06 to
                    03) and the BO status code is BB or B5, D035A attempts to release assets to
                    fill the BO following normal release logic (i.e., levels are checked, the MRC
                    is checked, other BOs are checked and serviceable assets must be available).

       3.4.2.3. Materiel Obligation and Validation (MOV). D035A and D035B implement
       MOV requirements documented in DLM 4000.25-1, Chapter 7. The quarterly MOV
       processes against BOs in D035A over a certain age to confirm that the customer’s
       requirement still exists and to reconcile these BOs with the due-in records of the
       requisitioning activity.

preclude cancellation of BOs. See paragraph 13.4.8 for sample format of a DIC APF
transaction.

            how D035A handles response and non-response prior to the due date as well as
            managing the need for reinstatement of requisitions canceled as part of the MOV
            process.
                3.4.2.3.2.1. Response and Non Response to MOV Requests. See Table 3.20 for
                detailed processing.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                    115


Table 3.20. Managing MOV Response and Non-Response
Scenario            Action
Customer Provides   1. Mechanical Response. Upon receipt of an MOV request (DIC AN_)
Response            transaction, the customer must respond to D035A with a reply to MOV
                    request (DIC AP_) transaction. This reply transaction must reach D035A
                    before the reply due date shown on the request to preclude automatic
                    cancellation of BOs. DICs AP1, AP2 and AP3 indicate the action to be
                    taken on individual MOV requests as follows:
                    1.1. D035A deletes the MOV request record which precludes automatic
                    cancellation.
                    1.2. The quantity field (rp 25-29) of the reply transaction will indicate the
                    quantity still required. D035A will cancel any quantity above this amount
                    using status code BR. If total cancellation is desired, the quantity field will
                    be zero-filled and D035A will “BR” cancel the entire quantity.1.3. If the
                    BO is in status code BV or BZ and DIC AP_ transaction is attempting to
                    cancel a portion or the entire quantity, D035A will internally generate DIC
                    AC1 with status code BR and create a “4A” controlled exception. The
                    “4A” controlled exception will contain the quantity to be canceled. This
                    action will request the IM to cancel the quantity on contract. Processing of
                    this controlled exception will be as specified in Chapter 8.
                    2. Manual Response. The customer will advise the MOV initiator in
                    writing if they are unable to provide a mechanical response by the due date
                    of the MOV request from the supply source. AFMC Lead and Site D035A
                    Functional OPRs can use the MOV screen to input an APF transaction to
                    clear MOV suspense records in this situation.
Customer Does       1. If D035A does not receive an AP_ transaction by the reply due date,
Not Respond         each BO record with a matching MOV request record will be identified for
                    cancellation. D035A will generate DIC AC3 cancellation transaction with
                    status code BS:
                    1.1. D035A will cancel BOs with status codes other than BV or BZ.
                    1.2. D035A will create “4A” controlled exceptions (containing DIC AC3
                    with action code “BS”) for BOs with status codes BV or BZ. The
                    “4A”controlled exception will contain the quantity to be cancelled in the
                    quantity field. This action will request IM to cancel quantities on ASI
                    because of non-response to an MOV request. Additional guidance for
                    processing of this controlled exception can be found in Chapter 8.
                    2. D035A will generate DIC AV_, Notification of Customer Nonresponse
                    to MOV Request, to the customer based on the BO’s M&S code.
                    2.1. The customer is required to conduct an item-by-item review and
                    respond with DIC AC_ cancellation transaction if the materiel is not
                    required.

Scenario         Action
                 2.2. During this review the BO will remain in “BV” or “BZ” status and
                 will be included in future MOV cycles.

           3.4.2.3.2.2. Reinstatement of Cancelled Requisitions.
              3.4.2.3.2.2.1. Requisitioning activities in receipt of confirmed cancellation
              (status code BS) as a result of the MOV program may request reinstatement of
              the cancelled requisitions for a period not to exceed 60 days following the
              transaction date of the AE_/status code BS cancellation. When reinstatement
              is required, the requisitioner will submit DIC APR for the quantity to be
              reinstated. DIC APR transaction will be prepared by the requisitioning activity
              using DIC AE_ as a basis to ensure that the correct suffix code is included.
              The advice code from the original requisition must be perpetuated in the APR
              transaction or the advice code will be treated as blank.
              3.4.2.3.2.2.2. D035A processes DIC APR as detailed in Table 3.21. Note:
              D035A Functional OPRs also have the capability to reverse “BS” or “BR”
              cancellations via the D035A REVA screen up to 120 days after the
              cancellation action (see paragraph 13.5.1).
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                    117

            3.4.2.3.3. Preparing the MOV Effectiveness Report. During the MOV cycle, D035B
            produces for each AFMC ICP two reports which provide statistics on the MOV
            program: “Materiel Obligation Validation Report.”
   3.4.3. Open Shipments. Requisitions are released for shipment using three different actions:
   DVD (ASI/ISI to which status codes BZ or BV applies), MRO (DIC A5_ to which status
   code BA applies) and RDO (DIC A2_ to which status code BA applies).
      3.4.3.1. Confirmations and Denials. See Table 3.22 and Table 3.23 for additional
      details.
            3.4.3.1.1. D035A expects to receive confirmation transactions (DICs AR0, ARA,
            ARB, BL0, BLA, BLB, ZKM, ZKS, ZKU and ZKV) and/or denial transactions (DICs
            A6_ and B7_) in response from the shipper.
118                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


         3.4.3.1.2. D035A does provide the capability to manually enter shipment
         confirmation and denial transactions, but this capability is to be used as an exception
         to normal processing.
             3.4.3.1.2.1. If the shipper is a depot storage activity, less than one percent of the
             time D035A does not receive the required confirmation or denial transaction in a
             timely manner; however, if the shipper is using the SBSS, this non-response
             percentage increases significantly. This fact may force the IM to manually enter a
             confirmation or denial transaction.
             3.4.3.1.2.2. For a degraded operations shipment (i.e., the IM elected to not output
             an MRO or RDO, transaction to the shipping activity), the IM must manually
             enter the required confirmation or denial transaction.
             3.4.3.1.2.3. If the shipper is using DSS and multiple, partial shipments are
             combined before the materiel is released to a commercial carrier, DSS sends
             D035A multiple shipment confirmation transactions that contain duplicate TCN
             entries. D035A only processes the first shipment confirmation transaction in this
             situation; so, the IM must manually enter a Confirmation for the remaining open
             quantity. There is also a capability to manually generate these follow-up and
             response transactions.
      3.4.3.2. ICP Follow-ups. For unconfirmed shipments, D035A mechanically generates
      follow-up transactions (DICs AF6 and BF7) to the shipper from whom it expects to
      receive a different set of status (DICs AE1, AE3 and AE6), confirmation (DIC BL7)
      and/or denial (DIC BT7) transactions. There is also a capability to manually generate
      these follow-up and response transactions. See Table 3.24 for specifics. Note: This
      table also contains information regarding shipment cancellation transactions (DIC AC6,
      AG6, AK6, AU0, AUA and AUB).
      3.4.3.3. Materiel Receipt Acknowledgements (MRA) and Pseudo Shipments. For open
      shipments with status code BA, D035A expects to receive from the requisitioner MRA
      transactions (DIC DRA). D035A mechanically generates pseudo shipment transactions
      (DIC ARH) to force as closed open shipments in two scenarios: confirmed shipments for
      which receipt acknowledgement transactions have not been received; unconfirmed
      shipments for which MRA transactions have been received. There is also a capability to
      manually post MRA transactions. See Table 3.23 for specifics.

                                  error occurs most often because the Unit Cost has
                                  not been loaded correctly in J018R.

                                  Most often, the data in J018R must first be

                                  match the correct suffix code assigned by D035A.
                                  This usually occurs because manual action was
                                  taken in D035A that changed the suffix code after
                                  the requisition was loaded into J018R.
                                  6.2. The requisition is still in BB, B4, B5 or NP
                                  BO status in D035A.
                                  6.3. The CFDA menu option was used to
                                  manually enter a confirmation transaction into
                                  D035A; so the transaction is a duplicate of what
                                  J018R provided.
                                  6.4. A shipment was incorrectly confirmed in
                                  J018R and D035A does not process a
                                  confirmation reversal transaction received from
                                  J018R; so, when the corrected confirmation
                                  transaction is later received from J018R, there is
                                  no open quantity in D035A.
                                  7. If the “ZKM,” “ZKS,” “ZKU” or “ZKV”
                                  transaction passed all edits and successfully
                                  updated the D035A BO and release order records,
                                  the following occurs:
                                  7.1. D035A attempts to release any matching
                                  DIC DRA transactions suspended as a “4H”
                                  controlled exception if the confirmation
                                  transaction was received from J018R. This is
                                  done because the DRA transaction often is
                                  received from the customer before the
                                  confirmation transaction is received from J018R.
                                  7.2. D035A attempts to close an FMS requisition
                                  because a DRA transaction is not expected from
                                  the customer.
                                  7.3. The total BO quantity on contract for DVD

                                  screen) maintained for each NSN is reduced by
                                  the confirmation quantity.
                                  7.4. DIC AS8 (shipment status) and DIC AB8

                                         processed because the requisition
                                         was in an open “BA” status, that
                                         transaction is now used to reduce the
                                         ordered quantity. If there is any
                                         remaining ordered quantity, it will
                                         be reinstated on the next available
                                         suffix code.
                                         6.5.3. If the IM attempted to cancel
                                         the open “BA” using the STAD
                                         screen, the system creates a “B4”
                                         BO with an ESD of 15 days into the
                                         future so long as there isn’t a DIC
                                         AC1 transaction from the customer
                                         on record.
                                         6.5.4. If the denial transaction is
                                         from D035K and the reason for
                                         denial code is a “Q” (Quantity not
                                         Available), an RBO transaction is
                                         submitted to attempt to release
                                         assets from another storage activity.
                                         6.5.5. If a BO already exists on

                                         6.5.8. If the Denial is against a

                                         the denied quantity was added back,
                                         a DIC D9B transaction is processed

Table 3.25. DIC AE1, AE3 and AE6 D035A Unique Status Code Descriptions
Status Description
Code
BA        This status code causes D035A to output DIC AE8 with status code BA.
BD        This status code causes D035A to output DIC AE8 with status code BD.
          Shipper has a record of the shipping request, but there is no record of what action was
BE        taken. This status code causes D035A to output a pseudo shipment status transaction
          (DIC ASH).
BF        This status code causes D035A to retransmit the original A2_ or A5_ to the shipper.
          Shipper has previously sent a denial transaction. If the denial transaction has not
BY        posted in D035A, DIC AE_ is converted into a denial transaction for continued
          processing.
B6        Shipper diverted shipment to an alternate consignee.
B8        Shipper unable to cancel shipment request.
B9        Shipper attempting to cancel shipment request.
CB        Shipper rejected shipment request.
CF        Shipper rejected shipment request as a duplicate.

     3.4.4. Reversals. Under certain circumstances, it is possible to reverse and take alternate
     action on orders that have been cancelled, rejected or released for shipment (confirmed or
     unconfirmed).
        3.4.4.1. Cancellations/Rejects.
            3.4.4.1.1. On the REVA screen (See paragraph 13.5.1 for a sample format), any
            AFMC Lead or Site D035A functional OPR user can reverse the total quantity
            cancelled/rejected (i.e., no partial reversals are allowed) and take an alternate action
            by choosing one of three action codes:
                3.4.4.1.1.1. Status code BA tells the system to process the requisition on the next
                available suffix code as if it is the first time the system has seen the requisition.
                This can result in the D035A automatically placing the requisition on BO (“BB,”
                “B5” or “NP” status results), passing the requisition to an alternate SOS (“BM”
                status results) or trying to fill the requisition with on-hand assets (“BA” status
                results).
                3.4.4.1.1.2. “O1” or “V1” tells the system to release assets for shipment from the
                specified storage site (“BA” status results).
            3.4.4.1.2. The only way to force the creation of a BO when reversing a cancelled or
            rejected suffix is to temporarily assign MRC “L” before processing the reversal
            action. After the BO has been created, MRC “L” must be removed.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                143


        3.4.4.1.3. If a cancelled/rejected suffix is successfully reversed, action code “RV” is
        assigned to that suffix. The “RV” action code is also assigned to the requisition
        transaction recorded to transaction history to identify it as a reversal transaction.
     3.4.4.2. Unconfirmed Shipment Reversals.
        3.4.4.2.1. For a degraded operations shipment from D035K, any AFMC Lead or Site
        D035A Functional OPR user can reverse an unconfirmed shipment via the D035A
        REVA screen as described in paragraph 13.5.1. This process will not be used for
        any other type of unconfirmed shipment, because although reversal transactions are
        passed to RAMP for in-transit processing no issue reversal transaction is created for
        the financial system feed.
           3.4.4.2.1.1. If D035A outputs a shipment request transaction, but there is no
           record of the shipment request transaction in D035K, a system error has occurred.
           This rare situation can happen due to a communications failure, a software error
           or a data error. The most frequent user error occurs when the user does not reply
           with a “Y” to the “Output MRO/RDO?” prompt when entering a manager-forced
           shipment action for a non-collocated D035K site. The other type of user error
           occurs when a user enters an invalid degraded operations shipment from the
           collocated D035K.
               3.4.4.2.1.1.1. If the user does not reply with a “Y” to the “Output
               MRO/RDO?” prompt when entering a manager-forced shipment action for the
               collocated D035K, D035A still sends D035K a shipment request transaction,
               but it contains action code “P” to indicate a degraded operations shipment.
               3.4.4.2.1.1.2. In response to a shipment request transaction that contains
               action code “PP,” D035K updates the asset balance record and creates the
               appropriate D7_ issue transaction for the feed to D035J. The shipment
               request transaction is not forwarded to DSS, because it is assumed that DSS
               received the shipment request through a phone call, E-mail or fax.
               3.4.4.2.1.1.3. Because there is no defined degraded operations shipment
               reversal transaction for D035A to send to the collocated D035K, it is
               important that the D035A Site Functional OPR user notify a D035K Site
               Retail OPR user when this action is taken; otherwise, during the monthly asset
               reconciliation process between D035K and DSS, it is very likely that D035K
               will have to process an inventory adjustment transaction for the NSN involved
               with the degraded operations shipment reversal. Note: If status code BA is
               successfully reversed, the action code “RV” is assigned to the reversed
               shipment request. The “RV” action code is also assigned to the requisition
               transaction recorded to transaction history to identify it as a reversal
               transaction.
        3.4.4.2.2. For other unconfirmed shipments, the user can post a denial transaction
        with DIC A6_ or “B7_” via the CFDB screen (See paragraphs 13.6.2.1 and
        13.6.2.2). This can result in D035A automatically placing the requisition on BO
        (“BB,” “B5” or “NP” status results), passing the requisition to an alternate SOS
144                                                       AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


         (“BM” status results) or trying to fill the requisition with on-hand assets (“BA” status
         results).
      3.4.4.3. Confirmed Shipment Reversals. Because of manual input errors which can
      occur in the shipping system, in J041 or in D035A, AFMC D035A Lead and Site
      Functional OPR users have the capability via the D035A REVE screen (paragraph
      13.6.7.2) to reverse a confirmed shipment that meets the following criteria: the order is
      not for an FMS customer; an MRA transaction with DIC DRA or DRB has not posted;
      and either the order is still in the active document control file or has been in history for
      less than 90 days.
         3.4.4.3.1. The most common reasons to use the REVE screen to reverse a confirmed
         shipment are as follows:
             3.4.4.3.1.1. The shipping activity did not respond with either a shipment
             confirmation or denial transaction within the prescribed time limit, so D035A
             processed DIC ARH. The customer has either called to inform the IM that they
             have not received the materiel or sent DIC DRB with discrepancy code F, which
             is suspended as a “2K” (discrepancy code is “B” or “F”) controlled exception.
             See Chapter 8 for further details.
         3.4.4.3.1.2. The wrong open “BA” was confirmed. This could occur in the shipping
         system, so D035A can receive a shipment denial transaction after receiving a
         shipment confirmation transaction. The shipment denial transaction is suspended as a
         “4N” (Transaction Mismatched to Trailer Record Data) controlled exception. See
         Chapter 8 for further details.
             3.4.4.3.1.3. The wrong open “BV” was confirmed. This could occur in J041 so
             D035A can receive a direct delivery confirmation (“ZK_”) reversal transaction
             after receiving a “ZK_” confirmation transaction.          The “ZK_” reversal
             transaction, indicated by a negative QTY field, is suspended as a “4N” controlled
             exception. See Chapter 8 for further details.
             3.4.4.3.1.4. A D035A user used the CFDA menu option to confirm the wrong
             open “BA” or “BV.”
         3.4.4.3.2. When a confirmed shipment is successfully reversed, the requisition is
         placed back into status code BA or BV. If a matching shipment denial transaction is
         found suspended as a “4N” controlled exception, D035A automatically deletes the
         controlled exception and resubmits the denial transaction for processing; otherwise,
         the D035A Site Functional OPR user will manually enter the desired denial
         transaction from the CFDB screen, if not otherwise posted.
         3.4.4.3.3. A confirmed shipment reversal transaction (i.e., the quantity field is a
         negative number which is sometimes denoted as a “\” in the first digit) is recorded to
         transaction history.
  3.4.5. Customer Follow-ups. For active orders (whether cancelled/rejected, backordered,
  passed, released for shipment or suspended on controlled exceptions), it is possible for
  D035A to respond to follow up transactions from a customer seeking the latest status. There
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                               145


   is also a capability to manually generate these follow-up and response transactions. See

      responsibility. Note: No capability exists to create a forced closure of a financial
      intransit record; therefore, by allowing either D035A or RAMP to force closed a supply
      intransit record, an IM also allows D035J to retain erroneous data.

      3.5.1.1. The two types of FMS requisitions are described in Table 3.28.

Table 3.28. Types of FMS Requisitions
Type          Description
Requisition
Repair and    These are commonly referred to as “H-coded” requisitions because they contain
Replace       an “H” in the first position of the document number serial number. For example:
              DUT0440035H001.
              H-coded requisitions are created by SAMIS when the FMS customer returns an
              unserviceable carcass to the ALC depot under the Repair and Replace program;
              therefore, the presence of an FMS H-coded requisition on BO means that an
              asset owned by an FMS country is included in the AF spares inventory.
Non-Repair-   These requisitions are called “Non-H-coded” requisitions to distinguish them
and-Replace   from H-coded requisitions. They have an all numeric document number serial
              number. For example: DUT04400350002.
              These are normal requisitions for serviceable items. These requisitions are
              submitted to establish initial operating stocks and to replace operating stocks that
              are condemned when no longer serviceable or reparable.

      3.5.1.2. SAMIS also codes requisitions as programmed or non-programmed based on an
      Eligible-to-be-Programmed Quantity (EPQ). The EPQ is initialized at zero but will be
 150                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


       revised to equal the FMS Order I (FMSO I) stock level after the specified lead-time. As
       programmed requisitions are processed, the quantity requisitioned is subtracted and a new
       EPQ is computed. See Table 3.29.

Table 3.29. Programmed and Non-Programmed Requisitions
Type Requisition    Description
Programmed          1. Programmed requisitions meet all these criteria:
                    1.1. Contain “V” in the last position of the document number DoDAAC.
                    1.2. Contain management code 1 in rp 72.
                    1.3. Are eligible for support from on-hand/on-order stocks based on the
                    priority of the requisition.
                    2. A requisition is coded as programmed for Other Service FMS
                    requisitions (with “B,” “K,” “P” or “T” in the first position of the document
                    number) and for Cooperative Logistics Supply Support Arrangements
                    (CLSSA) FMS Order Type II (FMSO II) requisitions when four conditions
                    are all met:
                    2.1. The requisition is for a recurring demand.
                    2.2. The item is part of the CLSSA stock level (FMSO I) case.
                    2.3. The item has been part of the FMSO I case for the specified lead-time.
                    2.4. The requisition quantity is equal to or less than the EPQ.
Non-Programmed      1. Non-programmed requisitions meet both these criteria:
                    1.1. Contain a management code 2 or blank
                    1.2. Are eligible for support lead-time away.
                    2. A requisition is coded as non-programmed if the quantity exceeds the
                    EPQ. Examples include: Items/quantities that have not been forecasted on
                    the CLSSA FMSO I case; and Other Service FMS requisitions not passed
                    from SAMIS (these are excluded from Joint Management Code [JMC]
                    identification).
The following combinations are possible:
1. Programmed H-coded requisition.
2. Non-Programmed H-coded requisition.
3. Programmed non-H-coded requisition.
4. Non-Programmed non-H-coded requisition.

   3.5.2. Support Determination. D035A can automatically take the following initial actions on
   FMS requisitions: Suspend for review; reject; release for shipment, pass to another ICP or
   BO. For an FMS requisition backordered or suspended for review, the IM has 14 days to
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                  151


  determine follow-on action.        The following paragraphs describe standard/special,
  initial/follow-on processing unique to or worth reiterating for FMS requisitions.
     3.5.2.1. Standard Processing.
        3.5.2.1.1. Suspend for Review. All transactions processed by D035A are first edited
        to ensure various field values contain valid data. Certain data errors are automatically
        corrected by the system; however, other errors must be manually corrected. When a
        transaction cannot be automatically corrected, it is automatically suspended as a
        controlled exception. Even if there are no transaction data errors, there are situations
        in which a controlled exception is still created for various reasons (i.e., HAF-directed)
        and require manual review of the transaction before it can be processed by the
        system. Chapter 8 provides detailed information for working D035A controlled
        exceptions. The four scenarios in Table 3.30 will cause FMS requisitions to be
        suspended as controlled exceptions awaiting review.

                            CLSSA program can do this because CLSSA participants become
                            AF supply system partners. The AF maintains an equity list of all

         3.5.2.1.2. Reject. Automatic D035A rejects occur for various reasons as detailed in
         paragraph 3.3.3.2.
         3.5.2.1.3. Release for Shipment. The decision to ship-from stock depends on the
         number of assets available, the control level, support level and critical support level
         (reference Chapter 11), the priority of the requisition and whether the requisition is
         programmed or non-programmed. Note: Because not all AF bases have the
         capability to properly prepare/package materiel prior to release (e.g., country-specific
         markings would require removal prior to being shipped to another FMS customer
         who might be at-odds with the previous owner of the materiel), D035A is coded to
         prevent shipment of base-held assets directly to the FMS customer or Freight
         Forwarder. Paragraph 3.11 details the process used by D035A to select a ship-from
         location.
             3.5.2.1.3.1. For programmed requisitions neither suspended for review nor
             rejected, D035A may automatically release assets for shipment from stock under
             the following circumstances:
                 3.5.2.1.3.1.1. The requisition priority is 09-15 and available assets are greater
                 than the item’s Support Level.
                 3.5.2.1.3.1.2. The requisition priority is 04-08 and available assets are greater
                 than the item’s critical support level.
                 3.5.2.1.3.1.3. The requisition priority is 01-03 and/or is designated as a
                 MICAP regardless of priority and whether available assets are greater than
                 any of the item’s stock levels.
156                                                  AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


         3.5.2.1.3.2. For non-programmed requisitions neither suspended for review nor
         rejected, D035A may automatically release assets for shipment from stock if the
         available assets are greater than the item’s control level.
      3.5.2.1.4. Pass to Other Service PICA. For programmed requisitions neither
      suspended for review nor rejected and for which the AF is a SICA, D035A may
      automatically pass the requisition to the OS/A PICA.
      3.5.2.1.5. Backorder. Requisitions that are not suspended for review, rejected, filled
      via automatic release of assets for shipment from stock or passed to an OS/A PICA
      are instead backordered.
         3.5.2.1.5.1. Backorder Establishment. BOs are established for both programmed
         and non-programmed requisitions.
             3.5.2.1.5.1.1. Programmed requisitions will be backordered with action code
             “BB” or “B5,” depending on whether the item has a restrictive MRC assigned
             (reference Chapter 11).
             3.5.2.1.5.1.2. Non-Programmed requisitions will be backordered with action
             code “NP” and assigned a Non-Programmed Suspense Date (NPSD). This
             date must be a realistic estimate of availability, not just a reiteration of the
             lead-time. Non-Programmed requisitions can remain on BO using action code
             “NP” provided that sufficient assets are on order or due in from repair to meet
             the requirement. If the asset position does not go above the control level prior
             to expiration of the NPSD, the requisition will automatically be changed to
             programmed.
         3.5.2.1.5.2. Backorder Follow-on Action. When an H-coded requisition has been
         on BO for over 180 days, the requisition must be reviewed for alternate support
         action. The IM must consider the fact that the country has already returned an
         unserviceable asset to the AF. When a non-H-coded requisition has been on BO
         for two or more years and it is not on contract for DVD, a determination needs to
         be made whether to keep the BO open or cancel it. BOs can be actioned in one of
         four ways depicted in Table 3.32. Special processing for FMS requisitions is
         detailed in Table 3.33.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                   157

Shipment From   1. Support for programmed requisitions using stocks under IM control (on-
Stock.          hand, received as due-in-from procurement, received as due-in-from-
                maintenance) is preferred.
                2. Requisitions are to be released for shipment based on UMMIPS as assets
                become available above the various stock levels described in Chapter 11.
                Non-Programmed:
                1. If stock becomes available prior to expiration of the NPSD on a
                backordered Non-Programmed requisition and the asset position goes above
                the control level, D035A will automatically release assets for shipment to fill
                the requisition.
                2. Non-Programmed FMS requisitions can be manually released for
                shipment when the asset position is below the control level; however,
                extreme care must be exercised.
                2.1. DoD recognizes shipment of non-programmed requisitions from stock
                below the Control Level as a valid method of support provided that support
                to United States forces and FMS programmed requirements are not adversely
                affected.
                2.2. The IM must consider the history of the item, accuracy of stock levels,
                scheduled due-ins, etc., prior to release.
                2.3. If the IM determines that the shipment can be made, s/he must obtain
                the first level supervisor’s approval prior to the release of the assets. See also

Passing Order   To Other Service PICA: If AF is a SICA for an item with a backordered
                FMS requisition and the OS/A PICA can support the ordered quantity within
                the RAD, the AF IM can pass the requisition to the PICA using action code
                “BM” on the BOAB screen. See also paragraph 3.5.3 for information
                regarding use of FMS FCs.
                To the Part And Repair Ordering System (PROS): The PROS contract
                incorporates supply and repair of standard items when the managing activity
                does not have organic capability or contractual support that meets the needs
                of the FMS customer. The IM together with the center supply management
                team is best qualified to determine the appropriate course of action to fill a
                requisition.

              identify candidates for PROS support and steps in the customer approval
              process.
              1.1. There is no need to first obtain country approval for passing non-
              programmed non-H-coded requisitions to PROS once the managing activity
              determines it to be the best SOS.
              1.2. Support via the PROS contractor is an option for programmed
              requisitions and Repair and Replace (H-coded) requisitions only after
              country approval is granted because they prefer AFMC support and may not
              provide this approval.
              1.3. If PROS authorization is not granted, revisit the requisition support
              capability and method of support decision.
              2. During the PROS authorization process, the IM will retain the requisition
              on BO until D035A receives a cancellation generated by the PROS PMO
              using SAMIS.
              2.1. If the requisition reflects status code BZ in D035A, concurrent with the
              request to support a requisition via the PROS contract, the IM will change
              the action code to “B4” using the TRM screen. This is to prevent D035A
              from suspending the cancellation transaction as a “4A” controlled exception
              (“Amended Shipping Instruction Cancellation Request”).
              2.2. In processing the cancellation transaction, D035A will pass “BQ” status
              back to SAMIS which then forward same to PROS for procurement action.
Procurement   Procurement is authorized to support programmed and non-programmed
              requisition quantities that are unfilled through release for shipment from
              stock or passing action. The purchasing vehicle to be used is dependent upon
              whether AF is PICA and on whether there exists an amendable contract for
              the pertinent item. The IM will apply action code “BZ” to all FMS
              requisitions for which a MIPR or PR (used to either amend an existing
              contract or request new procurement) has been initiated. Once the
              requirement has been placed on a firm delivery contract, the IM will change
              the “BZ” action code to “BV” using the BOAA screen. The IM must ensure
              that the ESD corresponds with the contract delivery schedule. See also
              paragraph 3.5.3 for information regarding use of FMS FCs.
              1. MIPR. If AF is a SICA on the item, but the OS/A PICA cannot support a
              MILSTRIP requisition via shipment from stock by the RAD, a MIPR must
              be initiated IAW AFMCI 23-102. The MIPR will contain all applicable
              contract information to facilitate purchase process for the PICA IM.
              2. Amend Existing Contract. If an amendable contract exists, the IM will act
              IAW AFMCI 23-102 to fill a backordered FMS requisition via DVD to the
              FMS country. The IM will either initiate an ASI to redirect shipment of
              assets already on order or initiate a PR amendment to increase the on-order

                quantity and ship these assets directly to the FMS customer.
                3. Initiate New Procurement. If no amendable contract exists, the IM will
                act IAW AFMCI 23-102 to initiate a PR for the backordered FMS requisition
                quantity with DVD to the FMS country.
Cancellation.   Although most cancellation actions are received in D035A from SAMIS, it is
                possible for the IM to manually cancel FMS requisitions after obtaining
                appropriate approval.
                1. Approval Requests.
                1.1. The IM must first obtain approval from both the International Logistics
                Program (ILP) focal point and first-line supervisor prior to initiating a
                manual cancellation of any FMS requisition. Any decision must also
                consider whether such a cancellation would drive financial liability for
                termination of procurement action already initiated.
                1.2. IMs must not cancel any FMS defined-order case requisitions (the
                second position of the requisition document number is “B”) without prior
                approval of the AFLCMC Air Force Security Assistance Cooperation
                (AFSAC) Directorate Case Manager; rather, they will ask the AFSAC Case
                Manager for help with unresolved problems.
                1.3. The IM must not cancel any FMS initial activation case (“D,” “S” and
                “Y”) requisition without approval of the PO/end article IM. The PO can be
                determined from the requisition document number serial number contained in
                rp 40-43.
                1.4. The IM must not cancel any H-coded Repair and Replace requisitions;
                rather, s/he will resolve problems in coordination with the AFSAC Case
                Manager.
                2. Invalid Reasons for Cancellation. The IM must not cancel FMS
                requisitions for the following reasons (Note: These conditions must be
                brought to the attention of the ILP requisitioning focal point):
                2.1. AF is a SICA on the requested item and an OS/A PICA can/will support
                the requirement upon receipt from the AF of either a funded requisition or
                MIPR.
                2.2. The requisition is for a high or excessive quantity.
                2.3. Insufficient stocks are available.
                2.4. Support is an excessive lead-time away.
                2.5. Support requires acquisition.
                2.6. The requisitioned item is applicable to a weapon system not in country.
                2.7. The requisitioned quantity is less than the vendor’s minimum
160                                                   AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014

            sale/minimum buy quantity (MBQ).
            2.8. Insufficient funding is available.
            3. Initiating Approved Cancellations. The IM will use the BOAB screen to
            input a cancellation with action code “CA” (see paragraph 13.4.1 for a
            sample format). No other action code is authorized for manual cancellation of
            FMS requisitions. The IM will also provide a narrative explanation of the
            reason for cancellation:
            3.1. The IM will provide the FMS customer the reason for requisition
            cancellation in a format defined by the AFSAC Case Manager (e.g., message,
            form letter, two-way memo, E-mail, etc.). Requisitions with document
            number serial numbers less than 5,000 are for a country-submitted
            requisition. Refer to DLM 4000.25, Volume 6, Chapter 3, Military
            Assistance Program Address Directory (MAPAD) for FMS customers’
            addresses for receipt of supply status.
            3.2. The IM will send the AFSAC case manager an informational copy of all
            cancellation correspondence on which AFSAC is not an action addressee.
            4. The IM will request help from the D035A OPR to reinstate erroneously
            entered “CA” cancellations IAW paragraph 13.10.3.

Table 3.33. Special Processing – FMS Follow-on Actions
Type Action          Description
RAD Management       1. A RAD is the number of months from the date of case implementation
                     that the requested item will be available for release to the Purchaser. It is
                     used to help the AF meet delivery commitments to the customer for system
                     activation. It also gives dates for the support of end-items of AF origin. It
                     is assigned to a programmed FMS requisition for major weapon systems,
                     end-items and concurrent spares as detailed in AFMCMAN 20-2.
                     2. RAD is comprised on of an “A” followed by two numeric characters.
                     The two numeric characters indicate the number of months from the date of
                     the requisition that requested materiel must be available for release. Actual
                     materiel availability date is the last day of the computed month. For
                     example, if the requisition is received in March and the RAD equals A06,
                     the materiel availability date is 30 September.
                     3. The FMS country manager initially establishes the RAD. The IM must
                     take action to ensure the materiel is available for shipment to meet the
                     RAD. Once assigned, the RAD is a commitment to meet a given delivery
                     date. Once the commitment is made, regardless of the method of support
                     selected, the item must be delivered. Should conditions arise that are
                     beyond the control of the IM (e.g., production slippage, strikes, etc.), the
                     IM will update the RAD using the BOAC screen (See paragraph 13.4.3.3
                     for a sample format). D035A will send the customer DIC AE3 with status
                     code B3.
Single Vendor        1. SVIC requisitions are received from SAMIS with advice code BV and
Integrity Contract   an ISI of SVIC. These SVIC requisitions are generated in SAMIS after an
(SVIC).              initial requisition with a fill or kill advice code has been rejected by
                     D035A. SAMIS passes the SVIC requisition to D035A which
                     automatically establish a “BV” BO with a SVIC ISI. The procurement
                     responsibility resides with the FMS country manager that manages the
                     FMS SVIC program. The IM is NOT to initiate procurement action on
                     these BOs.
                     2. The FMS country manager also has the responsibility to ensure that
                     action is taken to create the required procurement due-in record in the
                     J018R system. The due-in must be established to allow a DVD shipment
                     confirmation transaction with “ZKS” to process in D035A. The “ZKS”
                     transaction triggers the billing process for these FMS SVIC requisitions.
                     3. If an NSN with SVIC BOs is transferred to another D035A or Another
                     Service, the SVIC BOs are not transferred. They remain with the losing
                     D035A for completion.
Special Logic.       1. If the FC is “4F” but the first position of the document number is not
                     “D” or the first position of the SUPADD is a “Y,” the requisition is
 162                                                     AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


Type Action         Description
                    automatically rejected with status code CM, which indicates the fund
                    obligation is not cited and the item is not approved for free issue.
                    2. Special logic exists for processing FMS requisitions for consumable
                    items (ERRC “N” and “P”) containing advice code 2L indicating the
                    quantity requested exceeds normal demands but is a confirmed valid
                    requirement. An FMS requisition containing advice code 2L will have the
                    quantity up to the MRQ coded for shipment. The requisition quantity
                    above the MRQ will be output on a “9M” controlled exception (Quantity
                    Exceeds MRQ). Corrective actions give the user the option to write a PR
                    and add an ESD and input status code BZ or convert the requisition to
                    “BB” status for routine shipment action or “B4” status if the requirement is
                    to be challenged or validated.
                    3. Substitution will be attempted on both FMS program Grant Aid and
                    FMS program requisitions providing the FMS requisitions do not contain
                    advice code 2J.
                    4. If an AF FMS requisition (document number begins with “D”) has
                    project code 390, check the country code (the second and third positions of
                    the document number) against an internal Reliability Improvement
                    Warranty (RIW) edit table. If the country code is not on the table, the
                    requisition is suspended on a “9N” controlled exception (Invalid European
                    Participating Governments Reliability Improvement Warranty Requisition)
                    and must be worked by the IM using procedures found in Chapter 8.

   3.5.3. FMS Fund Codes (FC).
       3.5.3.1. Initial Assignment. SAMIS assigns a FC to all FMS requisitions to indicate the
       type of funds to be used.
          3.5.3.1.1. FC NU. AFMC funds are to be used in support of the requisition with later
          reimbursement from country funds.
              3.5.3.1.1.1. Programmed and non-programmed H-coded requisitions are assigned
              FC NU.
              3.5.3.1.1.2. Programmed non-H-coded requisitions that meet the CLSSA FMSO I
              criteria are assigned an FC NU.
              3.5.3.1.1.3. Non-Programmed non-H-coded requisitions are assigned FC NU if
              the NSN/quantity was used to clear CLSSA FMSO I liability.
          3.5.3.1.2. FC 4F (aka Direct Cite). AFMC funds are not to be used; rather, country
          funds are to be directly cited in support of the requirement. Non-Programmed non-H-
          coded requisitions are assigned FC 4F if the NSN/quantity was not used to clear
          CLSSA FMSO I liability.
       3.5.3.2. Changing FCs. As a rule, once assigned, FMS requisition FCs will not be
       changed; however, there are times when it is prudent to change the FC to improve the
       quality of support. See AFMCMAN 20-2 for additional details regarding FC changes.

          3.5.3.2.1. Requisitions Received with FC NU.
              3.5.3.2.1.1. H-coded Requisitions: The FC on programmed or non-programmed
              H-coded requisitions must never be changed from NU. See Table 3.34 for a
              graphical representation of this guidance.

              action if it will improve support. Each situation must be evaluated on its own
              merits. A FC change will be considered an action of last resort. See Table 3.35

              3.5.3.2.1.3. Non-H-coded Non-Programmed Requisitions: IMs have blanket
              authority to change the FC to 4F. The purpose of initially coding non-
              programmed non-H-coded requisitions with FC NU is to advise the IM to
              consider using available stocks or repair when filling the requisition. This is done
              because the NSN/quantity was once a CLSSA stock level and stocks may have
              been procured by the IM to support it. This gives the IM the opportunity to use
              on-hand/on-order stocks or repair action to clear out these assets. If stocks are not

              available, the IM is authorized to change the FC to 4F and procure the items or to
              route the requisition to the PROS. See Table 3.36 for a graphical representation
              of this guidance. The NSN/quantity was used to clear CLSSA FMSO I liability.

              3.5.3.2.2.1. Shipment Directly from a Contractor. For programmed and non-
              programmed non-H-coded requisitions for which the BO status is changed to
              “BZ” or “BV,” the FC must be changed from “4F” to “NL” only if an ASI was
              processed to ship materiel from an existing procurement due-in contract. If ISI
              procedures apply (i.e., a new contract was initiated using Direct Cite funds), FC
              4F must not be changed.
              3.5.3.2.2.2. Shipments from Stock. For programmed and non-programmed non-
              H-coded requisitions for which “V1” or “O1” manager action is taken to release a
              BO, the FC is automatically changed to NL (reimbursable) by D035A.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                    165


              3.5.3.2.2.3. Other Service PICA. The IM can pass programmed and non-
              programmed non-H-coded requisitions on items for which AF is the SICA to the
              PICA, if the OS/A ICP is able to support the order from on-hand stock or due-ins
              within the RAD. The FC is to be changed to NL in the passing order. Note: Any
              time a “BV” action code is reversed by the processing of a “ZP” transaction on
              the TRM screen, program logic will ensure the BO contains FC 4F.
3.6. Contractor Requisitions for AF-Managed Items.
   3.6.1. GFM. At no time is it appropriate for AF contractors to order AF-managed items as
   GFM directly from a government ICP; instead, contractors must send their requisitions
   through an AF MCA for validation. Depending on the type funds being used on the
   applicable contract, the requisition will be sent to either the SSSC subsystem or to CAV-AF.
      3.6.1.1. GFM under CDMAG WCF rules. Reference AFMCI 21-113, Contract
      Maintenance Program for Depot Maintenance Activity Group( DMAG), for procedures to
      request, approve and document CDMAG repair contractor authority to order AF-
      managed items as GFM.
          3.6.1.1.1. Contractors must send GFM requisitions with CDMAG FCs (GR, HR or
          LR depending on which ALC manages the contract) to SSSC for validation IAW
          Volume 5, Chapter 4.
          3.6.1.1.2. SSSC will automatically send requisitions that pass all edits to the item
          ICP D035A subsystem via a referral order transaction with DIC A4_.
          3.6.1.1.3. D035A receives the referral order and checks whether the contractor
          DoDAAC is on a specific table as having authority to requisition using MICAP
          designation. If the contractor DoDAAC is not on this table, any MICAP designation
          is removed from the applicable requisition. D035A then suspends the requisition on a
          type “34” controlled exception (see Chapter 8) and sends SSSC an MCA validation
          request transaction with DIC AX1. This secondary level of validation is necessary to
          reduce the risk of any contractor GFM order that is erroneously sent directly to the
          ICP of being filled without having been through the MCA validation process.
          3.6.1.1.4. SSSC sends D035A an MCA validation response transaction with DIC
          AX2 and an appropriate status code to approve or disapprove the GFM request (see
          AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 5, Chapter 4 for a list of these codes).
          3.6.1.1.5. If D035A has not received an AX2 transaction response from SSSC by the
          15th day after sending the AX1 transaction request, D035A will automatically clear
          the type “34” controlled exception and reject the requisition with status code DR. If
          D035A does receive an AX2 response in time, it will automatically clear the
          applicable type “34” controlled exception; then, based on the status code, it will reject
          the unauthorized quantity (total or partial) and release the requisition with the
          remaining authorized quantity (if any) for continued processing (see paragraph 3.3.3
          for details).
          3.6.1.1.6. Regardless which follow-on support action is taken, D035A sends
          pertinent supply and/or shipment status to SSSC. If D035A continued processing
166                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


         results in release of assets for shipment, the issue transaction with DIC D7_ provides
         D035J with direction/sufficient information to bill the CDMAG WCF.
      3.6.1.2. GFM under CDM Direct Cite Fund rules. Reference AFMCI 21-149, Contract
      Depot Maintenance (CDM) Program, for procedures to request, approve and document
      CDM repair contractor authority to order AF-managed items as GFM.
         3.6.1.2.1. Contractors must initiate GFM requisitions with a CDM FC (GD, HD or
         LD depending on which ALC manages the contract) within CAV-AF for MCA
         validation. CAV-AF will automatically forward requisitions that pass all edits to the
         item ICP D035A subsystem as order transactions with DIC A0_.
         3.6.1.2.2. D035A receives the requisition and checks whether the contractor
         DoDAAC is on a specific table as having authority to requisition using MICAP
         designation. If the contractor DoDAAC is not on this table, any MICAP designation
         is removed from the applicable requisition. D035A then suspends the requisition on a
         type “34” controlled exception (see Chapter 8) and sends CAV-AF an MCA
         validation request transaction with DIC AX1. This secondary level of validation is
         necessary to reduce the risk of any contractor GFM order that is erroneously sent
         directly to the ICP of being filled without having been through the MCA validation
         process.
         3.6.1.2.3. CAV-AF sends D035A an MCA validation response transaction with DIC
         AX2 and an appropriate status code to approve or disapprove the GFM request (see
         DLM 4000.25-1, Chapter 11, paragraph C11.5.6).
         3.6.1.2.4. If D035A has not received an AX2 transaction response from CAV-AF by
         the 15th day after sending the AX1 transaction request, D035A will automatically
         clear the type “34” controlled exception and reject the requisition with status code
         DR. If D035A does receive an AX2 response in time, it will automatically clear the
         applicable type “34” controlled exception; then, based on the status code, it will reject
         the unauthorized quantity (total or partial) and release the requisition with the
         remaining authorized quantity (if any) for continued processing (see paragraph 3.3.3
         for details).
         3.6.1.2.5. Regardless which follow-on support action is taken, D035A sends
         pertinent supply and/or shipment status to CAV-AF. If D035A continued processing
         results in release of assets for shipment, the issue transaction with DIC D7_ provides
         D035J with direction/sufficient information to record the shipment as a transfer out
         rather than as a sale. It is not until the contractor issues the GFM asset from his bond
         room to the maintenance line that downstream financial records are updated to show a
         sale to a non-Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group (CSAG) WCF workload or an
         expense to a CSAG WCF workload.
      3.6.1.3. GFM for Production Contractors. Reference AFMCI 23-105, Item Management,
      Chapter 5 for procedures to request, approve and document production contractor
      authority to order AF-managed items as GFM.
         3.6.1.3.1. Contractors must send GFM requisitions with a valid AF FC (usually
         assigned to the PO for whom the contract was issued) to SSSC for validation IAW
         AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 5, Chapter 3.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                  167


        3.6.1.3.2. SSSC will automatically send requisitions that pass all edits to the item
        ICP D035A subsystem via a referral order transaction with DIC A4_.
        3.6.1.3.3. D035A receives the referral order and checks whether the contractor
        DoDAAC is on a specific table as having authority to requisition using MICAP
        designation. If the contractor DoDAAC is not on this table, any MICAP designation
        is removed from the applicable requisition. D035A then suspends the requisition on a
        type “34” controlled exception (see Chapter 8) and sends SSSC an MCA validation
        request transaction with DIC AX1. This secondary level of validation is necessary to
        reduce the risk of any contractor GFM order that is erroneously sent directly to the
        ICP of being filled without having been through the MCA validation process.
        3.6.1.3.4. SSSC sends D035A an MCA validation response transaction with DIC
        AX2 and an appropriate status code to approve or disapprove the GFM request (see
        Volume 5, Chapter 3 for a list of these codes).
        3.6.1.3.5. If D035A has not received an AX2 transaction response from SSSC by the
        15th day after sending the AX1 transaction request, D035A will automatically clear
        the type “34” controlled exception and reject the requisition with status code DR. If
        D035A does receive an AX2 response in time, it will automatically clear the
        applicable type “34” controlled exception; then, based on the status code, it will reject
        the unauthorized quantity (total or partial) and release the requisition with the
        remaining authorized quantity (if any) for continued processing (see paragraph 3.3.3
        for details).
        3.6.1.3.6. D035A sends pertinent supply and/or shipment status to SSSC regardless
        of which follow-on support action is taken. If D035A continued processing results in
        release of assets for shipment, the issue transaction with DIC D7_ provides D035J
        with direction/sufficient information to bill the AF FC.
  3.6.2. CFM. AF repair and production contractors are authorized to purchase AF-managed-
  and-owned assets through government supply lines only if they are managed as BC “8”
  CSAG WCF items and only if their contract stipulates that they are authorized to do so.
     3.6.2.1. Contractors send authorized CFM requisitions formatted as shown in Table 3.38
     directly to the D035A subsystem where the item is managed.
 168                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014

65-66         Leave blank unless appropriate advice code applies
67-80         Leave blank

        3.6.2.2. D035A receives the order and checks whether the contractor DoDAAC is on a
        specific table as having authority to requisition using MICAP designation. If the
        contractor DoDAAC is not on this table, any MICAP designation is removed from the
        applicable requisition. D035A then suspends these CFM requisitions as type “9A”
        (Manager Review Item) or “9L” (classified materiel request) controlled exceptions
        awaiting IM review and action IAW Chapter 8.
        3.6.2.3. The IM determines whether the ordered quantity is supportable based on existing
        worldwide requirements and available assets. Note: Unlike with GFM, the IM has no
        prior indication that the CFM order is coming and has not been able to plan ahead for it.
        If the order is supportable, s/he clears the exception to allow continued processing.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                 169


     3.6.2.4. If D035A continued processing results in release of assets for shipment, the issue
     transaction with DIC D7_ provides D035J with direction/sufficient information to bill the
     contractor.
  3.6.3. Loan Requisitions.
     3.6.3.1. Detailed guidance for providing AFMC-owned-and-managed property to
     borrowers is found in AFMCI 23-105, Chapter 4. Also, refer to DoDI 5000.64,
     Accountability and Management of DoD Equipment and Other Accountable Property,
     and AFI 23-119, Exchange, Sale, or Temporary Custody of Nonexcess Personal
     Property, for additional guidance.
     3.6.3.2. Non-Contractor Borrowers. Non-contractor borrowers are permitted to use loan
     procedures to order authorized items directly from a government ICP.
         3.6.3.2.1. The borrower will perform MILSTRIP requisitioning IAW the pertinent
         loan agreement or contract. D035A will then process approved borrower and center
         focal point generated loan orders with the following results: forward a redistribution
         order to the storage site, reduce the number of on-hand assets by the quantity in the
         order, post status code BA for the applicable document number and forward status
         code BA through DAAS to the borrower.
         3.6.3.2.2. The borrower will acknowledge back to the LCO that he has received the
         loaned property.      The preferred method is via generation of a receipt
         acknowledgement transaction with DIC DRA back to the applicable D035A system;
         however, it is acceptable for the borrower to provide other hardcopy documentation
         proving materiel receipt (e.g., completed and signed DD Form 250) which the LCO
         can use to manually post a DRA transaction in D035A (see paragraph 13.6.3).
     3.6.3.3. Contractor Borrowers.
         3.6.3.3.1. Push or Pull.
            3.6.3.3.1.1. Replenishment Parts Purchase or Borrow (RPPOB) (Push). If the
            loan is being handled through the RPPOB program, the borrower will submit the
            requisition through SSSC for MCA validation.
            3.6.3.3.1.2. Non-RPPOB (Pull). If the loan is being handled outside the RPPOB
            program, the borrower will perform MILSTRIP requisitioning IAW the pertinent
            loan agreement or contract (see AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 5, Chapters 3 and 5).
            At no time is it appropriate for AF contractors using loan procedures to order AF-
            managed items directly from a government ICP; instead, contractors must send
            their requisitions through SSSC for MCA validation.
                3.6.3.3.1.2.1. The borrower-generated requisition will be referred from SSSC
                to the applicable D035A system where the item is managed. D035A suspends
                the requisition as a type “34” controlled exception and sends an AX1
                validation request back to SSSC. SSSC will reply to D035A with an AX2
                validation response. This will cause D035A to automatically clear the type
                “34” controlled exception.
                3.6.3.3.1.2.2. If SSSC authorized any or part of the ordered quantity for loan,
                D035A will recognize the requisition with the authorized quantity as a loan
 170                                                   AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


                order from an AF repair or production contractor and suspend it as a type
                “7L” exception in D035A. The LCO will clear the exception IAW procedures
                found in Chapter 8.
                3.6.3.3.1.2.3. D035A will reject unauthorized loan quantities and send the
                customer DIC AE8 with status code DN, DQ or DR.
         3.6.3.3.2. D035A will then process approved borrower and center focal point-
         generated loan orders with the following results: forward an RDO to the storage site,
         reduce the number of on-hand assets by the quantity in the order, post “BA” shipment
         status for the applicable document number, forward “BA” shipment status through
         DAAS to the borrower, update the “on-loan” quantity, and establish the loan record.
         For AF repair and production contractors, D035A will also forward “BA” shipment
         status through DAAS to SSSC.
         3.6.3.3.3. The borrower will acknowledge back to the LCO that he has received the
         loaned property.       The preferred method is via generation of a receipt
         acknowledgement transaction with DIC DRA back to the applicable D035A system;
         however, it is acceptable for the borrower to provide other hardcopy documentation
         proving       materiel      receipt     (e.g.,      completed      and     signed
         DD Form 250) which the LCO can use to manually post DIC DRA in D035A (see
         paragraph 13.6.3).
3.7. LP and LM Requisitions.
   3.7.1. LP items are assigned AAC L. LM items are assigned AAC F. Both are managed
   using the GSD stock fund concept (along with items managed by DLA/GSA and non-CSAG
   items managed by Other Services).
   3.7.2. Requisitions for LP and LM stock listed items are processed within D035A. See
   Table 3.39.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                  171



Table 3.39. Requisitions for LP and LM Items
Asset Status         Action
Asset is Available   Ship asset to fill requisition.
Asset is Not         Requisitions without advice code 2A, 25 or 3B (indicating the item is not
Available            locally obtainable through manufacture, fabrication or procurement)
                     and/or coded MICAP are automatically rejected with status code CP (ICP
                     for the item is local manufacture/fabrication and procurement as
                     applicable).
                     Requisitions with advice code 2A, 25 or 3B or coded MICAP are
                     suspended as “9D” LP Item or “9E” LM Item controlled exceptions.
                     1. Funds Check. In determining method of support, LM and LP
                     requisitions must receive a funds availability check to assure the
                     extended dollar value of the requisition does not exceed the applicable
                     funds limitation.
                     1.1. GSD (BC 9) LM and LP items, this funding limitation is reflected in
                     the Materiel Acquisition Control Record (MACR). See AFI 23-101,
                     Section 2C.
                     1.2. Equipment (ERRC “S” or “U,” BC “Z”) LM and LP items, a
                     requisition must contain FC 17 (or an alpha code in the first position and
                     “K” in the second position) as well as advice code 2A , 25 or 3B;
                     otherwise, the “9D” or “9E” exception will be manager actioned with
                     status code CH (indicating the requisition was submitted to the incorrect
                     single manager) and the correct ICP RIC.
                     2. Method of Support. In some cases, clearing “9D” or “9E” controlled
                     exceptions completes the action to support the suspended requisition. In
                     other cases, clearing exceptions is done in concert with other actions to
                     support the suspended requisition. In either case, the IM action to clear
                     the exception triggers D035A to send the customer appropriate supply
                     status. Clearing actions are detailed in Chapter 8 and summarized as
                     follows:
                     2.1. If the requested LM or LP item is already on-hand, clear the
                     controlled exception using “B4” manager action to place the requisition
                     on BO; then, use action code “O1” via the BOAA screen to release the
                     BO for shipment of the requested materiel.
                     2.2. If an acceptable substitute for the requested LM or LP item is
                     already on-hand, clear the controlled exception using “B4” manager
                     action to place the requisition on BO; then, use action code “O1” via the
                     BOAA screen to release the BO for shipment of the substitute item.
                     2.2.1. For LP items, the IM may initiate an ASI (against an established
                     contract) or an ISI (to request new procurement) to fill the requisition via
 172                                                     AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


Asset Status          Action
                      DVD from the vendor; then, clear the controlled exception using either
                      BZ (contract not yet established) or BV (contract already established)
                      action code. Use the BOAA screen to change the action code from BZ to
                      BV once an ISI is complete and the requisition is on contract.
                      2.2.2. For LM items, the IM may initiate a work order to have depot
                      maintenance perform local manufacture of the desired items. If the item
                      is locally manufactured, it is mandatory that BOs be pre-positioned in the
                      correct D035K system, because D035A does not receive an asset balance
                      overlay transaction from D035K for these types of items (see paragraph
                      3.7).
                      2.2.2.1. The work order will include an appropriate fund citation and the
                      pertinent requisition document number as well as a project order,
                      specifications, drawings, etc. as required by maintenance to manufacture
                      the item(s); then, s/he will clear the controlled exception using “B4”
                      manager action to place the requisition on BO. Once locally-
                      manufactured assets become available, the IM will use action code “O1”
                      via the BOAA screen to release the backorder for shipment.
                      2.2.2.2. D035A suspends as a type “9Q” controlled exception any
                      request for cancellation of a backorder for an LM item. The IM must
                      take action to attempt to stop the manufacturing process. If successful,
                      the IM clears the controlled exception using “BQ” manager action to
                      cancel the BO. If unsuccessful, the IM clears the controlled exception
                      using “B8” manager action to retain the requisition on BO and to advise
                      the customer that cancellation was not possible.
                      2.2.3. For LM or LP items, the IM may clear the controlled exception
                      using “CH” or “CP” manager action to reject the requisition.
                      2.2.4. For LM or LP items, the IM may clear the controlled exception
                      using “B4” manager action to place the requisition on BO; then use a
                      “BM” action code via the BOAB screen to pass the requisition to an
                      OS/A ICP.

3.8. Routed Item Repair Quantity (RIRQ) Requisitions.
   3.8.1. The RIRQ for an ERRC “T” item represents the smallest serviceable asset overage
   quantity for an item in any given quarter and is provided by the requirements system or is
   manually input through the MIRD screen. The RIRQ for non-bachelor items is taken from
   the levels record with the same NSN as the subgroup Master NSN of the I&SG subgroup.
   Note: The RIRQ automatically reduces to zero when the item ERRC is changed to “N,” “P,”
   “S” or “U.”
   3.8.2. In conjunction with completing an AFMC Form 206, Temporary Work Request, to
   have depot maintenance modify, convert, disassemble, reclaim, etc., an asset, the IM must
   ensure the RIRQ for the item as reflected on the NSNA screen is sufficient to allow release
   of assets for the work to be accomplished.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                    173


   3.8.3. When a depot maintenance organization is ready to perform the work agreed to under
   the AFMC Form 206 process, they submit an issue request to D035K. D035K, in turn,
   submits a requisition to D035A citing advice code 6Z. For a requisition with advice code 6Z,
   D035A compares the requisitioned quantity against the RIRQ level. The difference between
   the two values determines when the serviceable asset position of the item is excess and
   available to support the end item repair line.
      3.8.3.1. If the RIRQ is zero, the requisition is rejected with a status code CB.
      3.8.3.2. If a RIRQ level is found, any requisitioned quantity greater than this level is
      backordered. The RIRQ level is reduced by the backordered quantity.
      3.8.3.3. If the requisitioned item contains MRC “A,” the system puts the requisition on
      “B5” BO. For items with any other MRC for which the system would normally create a
      “B5” BO on a RIRQ requisition, the system instead creates a “9A” controlled exception.
      The “9A” exception must be worked IAW Chapter 8.
          3.8.3.3.1. If assets are available and there are no higher priority requisitions on BO,
          the IM will clear the controlled exception using action code “O1,” “V1” or “V4” to
          release assets for shipment in support of the requisition.
          3.8.3.3.2. If insufficient assets are available, the IM will clear the controlled
          exception using manager action “CB” to reject the unsupportable quantity.
3.9. Asset Release Sequences.
   3.9.1. D035A is designed to automatically establish, maintain, modify, cancel and release
   BOs. Upon an increase to serviceable materiel on-hand, a decrease to stock levels or a
   change to certain CMD, D035A automatically processes an internal RBO action to attempt to
   ship materiel. The first step in this process is to sort all BOs into the desired release order.
   3.9.2. D035A uses UMMIPS, SPRS and EXPRESS release logic to decide which BO(s) will
   be released.
      3.9.2.1. The LL code identifies which release sequence is being used for a given NSN as
      shown in Table 3.40. BOs listed in the various release sequences are visible on two
      D035A screens as follows:
          3.9.2.1.1. The BOAE screen default view is SPRS. For those items with LL code
          “L” or “M,” press the “PF11” key to view the EXPRESS release sequence. Note:
          Only those items with LL code “L” or “M” will display data. There is no view of the
          UMMIPS release sequence on this screen.
          3.9.2.1.2. The DODD screen default view is SPRS. For those items with LL code
          “L” or “M,” press the “PF11” key to view the EXPRESS release sequence. Press the
          “PF12” key to view the UMMIPS release sequence.

L and M EXPRESS expedited repair of the item and expedited transportation for the return of
                the carcass. All MRCs and pre-positioning are overridden.
                       Transportation on serviceable shipments to customer is based on
BLANK SPRS
                       information contained in the requisition and standard return of carcasses.
                       EXPRESS item that is temporarily blocked by the IM to prevent
                       EXPRESS distribution of items with a restrictive MRC or to temporarily
                       require standard SPRS rather than EXPRESS distribution processing to
                       take place on the NSN for a temporary period. When it is determined
                       that EXPRESS distribution will be resumed, the LL code must be
X         SPRS
                       changed to “A” or “C.” If an NSN has a LL code “X” and EXPRESS
                       has a pre-position flag of “Pre-position and Ship” or “Pre-position only,”
                       D035A will not accept it for the NSN with the LL code “X” even though
                       EXPRESS includes the items on the EXPRESS distribution file it sends
                       to D035A.
Note: AF supports non-AF customer requisitions in UMMIPS sequence but adjusts the sequence
of AF customer requisitions using either SPRS or EXPRESS sequencing (i.e. if an item has four
BOs, one for an FMS customer and the remainder for AF customers and the FMS BO is ranked
first in UMMIPS sequence, then SPRS sequence will rank the FMS BO first but then may re-
sequence the remaining three AF customer BOs).

       3.9.2.2. LL Code Interfaces. D035A passes the LL code to D043 and RAMP as shown
       in Table 3.41.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                   175




Table 3.41. D035A LL Code Interfaces
Interface System         Description
                         D035A will pass this LL code to D043 in the 170 stock list change
                         transaction. For any new item that D043 initiates or an item that was
                         previously other than ERRC “T” but has now changed to ERRC “T”
                         due to catalog action, the LL code will be blank. D035A will pass the
                         LL code to D043 as follows:
                         D035A LL Code       Code Passed to D043      Code Passed to RAMP
D043                     A                   A                        A
                         C                   C                        C
                         L                   A                        L
                         M                   C                        M
                         X                   SPACES                   X
                         BLANK               SPACES                   BLANK
                         D035A will pass a transaction with DIC BDR to RAMP to update the
                         RIMCS priority code.
                         1. If the LL code on an item record equals “A,” “C,” “L” or “M,”
                         RAMP automatically sets the RIMCS priority code to 03.
                         2. If the LL code is “X” or “blank,” RAMP automatically sets the
RAMP                     RIMCS priority code to 13. See Chapter 6.
                         3. IMs cannot downgrade priority 03 requisitions if the LL code is
                         “A,” “C,” “L” or “M.” However, manual change of priorities 03
                         through 13 can be processed if the LL code is “X” or “blank.”
                         4. RAMP forwards updated RIMCS information to D043 if a priority
                         change has been made.

   3.9.3. UMMIPS is the DoD system for allocating materiel and other logistics resources
   among competing demands. Reference DoDM 4140.01, DoD Supply Chain Materiel
   Management Procedures, Volume 8. The UMMIPS sort logic applied in D035A is
   sequenced as follows:
       3.9.3.1. Priority Code. For example, within the sort logic, this means that all priority
       designator 03 BOs are always considered more important than priority designator 05
       BOs.
       3.9.3.2. Preferential Priority Code (PPC). A BO with a project code that begins with “9”
       is assigned a higher PPC than a BO with no project code. Likewise, a BO with a RDD
       indicating a MICAP situation is assigned a better PPC than a BO with a non-MICAP
       RDD.
176                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


      3.9.3.3. The date the requisition was received by D035A (not the YDDD date in the
      document number).
      3.9.3.4. The document number serial number (last four positions of the document
      number).
      3.9.3.5. The document number DoDAAC (first six positions of the document number).
  3.9.4. SPRS does not consider the priority designator as the most important data element
  when sorting BOs; so, it is possible that a priority designator 05 requisition from a deployed
  unit is considered more important than a priority designator 03 requisition from D035K
  under the SPRS logic. Instead, each BO is assigned a release sequence number based on the
  priority designator, project code, RDD, and advice code. A BO with a release sequence
  number of 100 is considered more important than a BO with a release sequence number of
  150.
      3.9.4.1. SPRS is only used after UMMIPS has determined that the highest priority BO to
      release is a BO from base or depot retail (i.e., the document number begins with “FB”).
      IMs must not intentionally bypass SPRS logic by using a restrictive MRC or by pre-
      positioning BOs in D035K based on UMMIPS rather than SPRS logic without first
      receiving approval from their first level supervisor. If a requisition is manually released
      out of order, IMs must document the reason through the use of the D035A IUTU screen
      (See paragraph 13.21.6).
      3.9.4.2. The current SPRS release assignment logic can be viewed on the SCS Midtier
      BO Release Sequence Criteria table (https://scsapps.day.disa.mil/afhome/). Note: The
      PPC is used internally in D035A and is not visible to the IM. It is passed to EXPRESS
      which uses it to prioritize release.
  3.9.5. EXPRESS. The Distribution Module within EXPRESS uses the output of its
  prioritization process (based on SPRS-sequenced BOs provided by D035A and on
  improvement in weapon system availability) to determine where items will be distributed.
      3.9.5.1. When EXPRESS has an item identified with either a “Pre-position and Ship” or
      “Pre-position only” pre-position flag, the item is included in an EXPRESS Distribution
      File created in the Single Prioritization Across Weapon Systems (SPAWS) Rank
      Sequence and sent to D035A each day. Reference AFMCI 23-120, Execution and
      Prioritization Repair Support System (EXPRESS).
      3.9.5.2. Except when the LL code is “X,” D035A will automatically assign LL code “L”
      or “M” to items on the distribution file received from EXPRESS. As shown in Table
      3.41, if LL code “L” or “M” applies, all MRCs, pre-position codes and levels will be
      overridden and requisitions will be released only in the EXPRESS release sequence.
         3.9.5.2.1. If a MICAP or JCS project coded requisition is received in D035A after the
         EXPRESS distribution file has been received, the LL code is changed to “blank” and
         the requisitions will be released in SPRS ranked order. When the next EXPRESS
         distribution file is received in D035A, the LL code will be changed back to “L.”
         3.9.5.2.2. If the ICP and SOR are non-collocated, D035A will remote pre-position
         BOs in EXPRESS release sequence for NSNs with a LL code “L” or “M.” D035A
         will remote pre-position for the quantity that is showing in SCC M.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                   177


      3.9.5.3. An IM can temporarily delete LL code “L” or “M” or change to “X” via the
      MIRC screen in D035A. The IM may need to allow standard SPRS processing to take
      place on the NSN for a limited time by deleting the LL code or prevent EXPRESS pre-
      positioning by allowing an MRC to prevent automatic release of assets. On the MIRC
      screen, file maintain an asterisk to delete the LL code. When it is determined that
      EXPRESS distribution will be resumed, the IM will change the LL code in D035A to
      “A” or “C.”
3.10. Pre-positioning Backorders in D035K.
   3.10.1. Pre-positioning is the process used by D035A to transfer the responsibility for filling
   a BO to D035K. A pre-positioned BO is typically filled by D035K when a depot
   maintenance shop turns in a repaired asset to central receiving. Rather than sending a bin or
   stow notice to DSS and a RBO transaction to D035A, D035K sends an RDO transaction with
   DIC A2_ to DSS to immediately ship the asset from central receiving to fill a backordered
   customer requirement. This saves about two days of processing time (one day to store the
   asset and another day to retrieve it for shipment). It also saves the AF money (AF is charged
   a handling fee every time it requests an asset be stored in or retrieved from a DLA controlled
   storage facility); therefore, an IM always pre-positions a BO in D035K if it is to be filled
   through depot repair and there is an in-transit from maintenance balance being reported by
   D035K.
   3.10.2. See Table 3.42 for the three primary methods of pre-positioning BOs in D035A.
 178                                                    AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014




Table 3.42. Methods to Pre-position Backorders in D035A
Pre-position Method         Explanation
IM Changes NSN-             The pre-positioning code assigned to an NSN can be changed to
Assigned Pre-position       “A” by the IM. This prompts D035A to automatically pre-position
Code                        any new priority 01-08 BO in D035K. This method must not be
                            used if the SOR is a non-collocated D035K subsystem or a
                            DMISA repair activity.
                            1. The pre-positioning code assigned to an NSN is visible on the
                            NSNA screen under the “Prep Cd” label. The IM can change the
                            pre-positioning code via the MIRC screen by inputting the actual
                            NSN in the “Stock Number” field, “A” in the pre-position code”
                            field and the applicable three-position IM MDC.
                            2. The BO is not pre-positioned in D035K if it reflects a “5” or an
                            “E” in the third position of the DIC (exception data exists for the
                            requisition).
                            3. The entire backordered quantity is pre-positioned, as indicated
                            by the pre-positioned quantity code of “T” (for total quantity).
IM Manually Pre-positions   The IM can manually pre-position a BO either in the collocated
Individual Backorder        D035K subsystem or in a non-collocated AFMC ICP D035K
                            subsystem using the BOAC or BOAE screen. It is not necessary to
                            apply pre-position code “A” to an item to pre-position by
                            document number. A BO pre-positioned in a non-collocated ALC
                            D035K subsystem is referred to as a remotely pre-positioned BO.
                            No process exists for D035A to remotely pre-position a BO in a
                            non-D035K subsystem (e.g., within DSS for assets stored at a non-
                            AF depot such as Barstow).
                            1. Only BOs with status codes BB, B4 or B5 status can be pre-
                            positioned.
                            2. The quantity to pre-positioned must be entered. “T” is used to
                            pre-position the total quantity. A quantity of 1 – 9 may also be
                            entered. Because most depot maintenance turn-ins are for a
                            quantity of one, it is highly recommended that the quantity entered
                            be “1.”
                            3. If the BO is to be pre-positioned in a non-collocated ALC
                            D035K system, the RIC for that subsystem (i.e., FGB, FHB or
                            FLB) must be entered. If no RIC is entered, D035A assumes the
                            BO is to be pre-positioned in the collocated D035K system. It
                            would be counter-productive to pre-position a BO in the collocated
                            D035K subsystem if the SOR is a non-collocated ALC (e.g., ICP
                            is Tinker, but SOR is Hill) or a DMISA site.

Pre-position Method           Explanation
Responsibility Delegated to Responsibility for releasing assets to fill BOs can be delegated to
EXPRESS                     EXPRESS. All BOs for an EXPRESS controlled item (LL code
                            “L” or “M”) are considered pre-positioned. If the SOR is a non-
                            collocated ALC, the EXPRESS process pre-positions BOs in that
                            ALC’s D035K system.

   3.10.3. The BOAC or BOAE screen is also used to remove a pre-positioned BO from
   D035K’s responsibility. The user simply inputs an asterisk (*) as the new pre-positioned
   quantity. See paragraph 13.4.3.3 for a sample format.
       3.10.3.1. For a pre-positioned BO in the collocated D035K system, this action updates
       the BO record (i.e., deletes the pre-positioned quantity code) so that the D035K
       backorder release logic does not consider the backorder as releasable.
       3.10.3.2. For a remotely pre-positioned BO, a transaction with “ZR_” and action code
       “CC” is sent to the non-collocated ALC D035K subsystem for processing. Once the pre-
       positioned backorder is deleted, D035K returns a transaction with “ZCO” and status code
       BQ to D035A. This transaction updates the BO record (i.e., deletes the pre-positioned
       quantity code and remote RIC) so that D035A now considers the BO as releasable.
       Contact the local D035A Functional OPR for assistance if required.
   3.10.4. Things to consider about pre-positioning BOs:
       3.10.4.1. If the item is locally manufactured, it is mandatory that BOs be pre-positioned
       in the correct D035K system, because D035A does not receive an asset balance overlay
       transaction from D035K for these types of items (see paragraph 3.7).
       3.10.4.2. D035K releases pre-positioned BOs in either the SPRS or EXPRESS-provided
       release sequence; but, D035K can release only pre-positioned BOs. If some, but not all
       BOs for an item are pre-positioned, there is a possibility of assets being released in the
       wrong sequence. For example, if the #1 priority BO is remotely pre-positioned in D035K
       and a serviceable balance is reported to D035A (e.g., a base excess reported by RAMP or
       an inventory gain transaction from a non-D035K storage facility), D035A skips the pre-
       positioned BO and fills the #2 priority BO. IMs will not use the pre-positioning process
       to bypass SPRS without management approval. IMs will document the reason for
       releasing a BO out of sequence by updating the document number narrative via the IUTU
       screen.
   3.10.4.3. An MRC can prevent normal D035A requisition processing. Processing depends
   on the particular MRC. For example: If an item has both an MRC “E” and a pre-position
   code “A,” then BOs with priorities 01 - 03, and/or JCS project codes and/or MICAP
   indicators will automatically be pre-positioned; however, priority 04 - 15 backorders will be
   forced with status code B5 and will not be pre-positioned. Note: BOs with status code B5
   can still be manually pre-positioned by document number, effectively overriding the MRC.
   A restrictive MRC does not prevent D035K from filling a pre-positioned BO once D035A
   shows the BO is pre-positioned.
       3.10.4.4. RDOs will only release from prime receipts during daily processing and will
       not be processed from any existing ownership code 09 asset balance. If assets are on-
 180                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


       hand, IMs will use the D035A BOAA screen “Release Backorder” to release the BO for
       shipment. See paragraph 13.4.5 for a sample format.
   3.10.5. Process Description.
       3.10.5.1. When a BO is pre-positioned in the collocated D035K, the only action taken is
       an update of the Backorder record that is shared by D035A and D035K. When D035K
       processes a turn-in or receipt transaction with a serviceable SCC for an NSN with a ICP
       RIC equal to the collocated D035A, D035K uses the BO record to determine if the asset
       can be released for shipment or must be stowed.
       3.10.5.2. When a BO is pre-positioned in a non-collocated D035K:
          3.10.5.2.1. D035A sends a “ZR_” transaction to D035K to create, modify or delete a
          PMRO record depending on the action code used.
              3.10.5.2.1.1. Action code is “blank”: If assets are on-hand, D035K processes the
              transaction as an RDO (DIC A2_); otherwise, it creates a PMRO record.
              3.10.5.2.1.2. Action code “CC”: D035K deletes the PRMO record.
              3.10.5.2.1.3. Action code “RM”: D035K modifies the PRMO record.
          3.10.5.2.2. D035K sends D035A a “ZCO” transaction with status code BA, BK or
          BQ to provide status on the BO.
              3.10.5.2.2.1. Status code BA: Indicates asset(s) shipped.
              3.10.5.2.2.2. Status code BK: Indicates a PMRO record was successfully created
              or modified.
              3.10.5.2.2.3. Status code BQ:      Indicates a PMRO record was successfully
              deleted.
3.11. Asset Selection Process.
   3.11.1. D035A is designed to automatically generate an RDO or MRO transaction to fill a
   customer order if MRC and levels logic does not force D035A to create a BO and there are
   assets available. Paragraphs 3.11 through 3.11.3.6 explain the process used by D035A to
   determine which asset(s) will be shipped based on prescribed UMMIPS, SPRS or EXPRESS
   asset distribution guidelines.
   3.11.2. D035A will use excess base assets first, OS/A storage sites (rare) next and then depot
   assets to support requisitions.
       3.11.2.1. D035A receives excess base asset information from RAMP, which in turn
       computes excess at an individual AF base for CSAG recoverable items. For applicable
       items that have not been assigned a No Compute code, RAMP will compute a base
       excess position and provide this data daily to D035A (see Chapter 6). The D035A
       NSNC screen displays the excess quantity as well as the percent the base is excess. The
       base can be in a total excess position or a partial excess position. Table 3.43 details the
       base excess codes.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                    181

       3.11.2.2. It is possible to give priority to moving assets from specific locations outside
       the normal site selection sequence. Typically this is done to attrite assets from facilities
       that have insufficient storage capacity or which are closing. See paragraph 13.17.9 for
       sample format of a Mass Attrition Site Update (DIC ZFV) transaction.
    3.11.3. The following is a detailed release sequence for using available assets:
       3.11.3.1. For any requisition from D035K (depot retail supply), D035A will attempt to
       RDO/MRO assets from various locations in the following order:
           3.11.3.1.1. Collocated AF depot wholesale stock.
           3.11.3.1.2. Non-collocated AF depot wholesale stock.

      attempt to RDO/MRO assets from various locations in the following order:
         3.11.3.3.1. Any attrition site defined for the applicable NSN.
         3.11.3.3.2. Total base excess anywhere within CONUS (any numeric geographical

      applies the CONUS logic.
3.12. ESD Computation.
   3.12.1. The method for an ESD assignment to a BO depends on:
      3.12.1.1. Whether the requisition is categorized as MICAP.
      3.12.1.2. Whether the BO status code is or will be BB, BV, BZ, B4, B5 or NP.
      3.12.1.3. Whether the current ESD was mechanically assigned.
      3.12.1.4. Whether the current ESD has expired.
      3.12.1.5. Whether D035A is assigning the ESD as the result of a follow-up for either
      current status or for an improved ESD.
   3.12.2. Follow-up transactions with DIC AFC requesting improved status that match a BO
   with status code BV or B4 or any BO with priority designator 01 - 08 will be output on a
   “7E” controlled exception for IM review/action IAW Chapter 8.
   3.12.3. See Table 3.44 for details regarding ESD computation for Non-MICAP requisitions
   and Table 3.45 for details regarding ESD computation for MICAP requisitions.

Type
             Description
Assignment
Initial      Establishing BOs with status codes BV, BZ, B4 or NP. D035A requires users to
Assignment   specify an ESD as part of manually placing a requisition on BO with status codes
             BV, BZ, B4 or NP status. In some cases, the system creates these type BOs
             mechanically; so, because there is no person to enter the correct ESD, the system
             will compute the ESD as follows:
             1 . The ESD for mechanically-established BOs with status codes BV, BZ and B4
             defaults to current date plus four days for a MICAP or current date plus 15 days
             for non-MICAP.
             2. The ESD for mechanically-established BOs with status code NP is computed
             as follows:

             Establishing BOs with status codes BB or B5. D035A automatically assigns an
             ESD to a requisition during its establishment as a BO with status codes BB or B5
             status. An ESD is determined by comparing a BO’s release position to the total
             available assets.
             1. A BO’s release position is determined as described in paragraph 3.10.
             2. The total available assets are categorized as either on-hand or due-in from
             procurement to a depot:
             2.1. On-hand.
             2.1.1. In storage as ownership code 9 or purpose code A with SCCs A and F.

              2.1.2. Organic work in progress as SCC M.
              2.1.3. Reparable in-transit from local depot maintenance to depot supply as SCCs
              1, 2 or 3.
              2.2. Due-in from Procurement.
              3. The ESD is computed as follows:
              3.1. When SCC A assets are not available, but SCC M assets exist, the ESD is
              computed as current date + the average Shop Flow Days (SFD) for repair + two
              days for serviceable intransit from maintenance. The average SFD is a composite
              average of both organic maintenance and contractor repair.
              3.2. When only SCC F assets are available the ESD is computed as current date +
              one day for warehouse pick + two days for intransit reparable to maintenance +
              the average SFD for repair + two days for serviceable intransit from maintenance.
              3.3. When no assets are available but sufficient procurement due-ins are
              expected, the ESD is computed as current date + incremental expected delivery
              days (e.g., 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, etc.).
              3.4. When no assets are available under the above conditions, the ESD will be
              the production lead-time. If no production lead-time is available, the default is
              360 days.
Updating an   D035A will attempt to mechanically update an ESD for a non-MICAP BO each
Expired       time the ESD expires. Depending on the BO status code, either the ESD will be
ESD           updated or a “ZFY” transaction will be output on a “7E” controlled exception
              requiring IM review and action IAW Chapter 8.
              1. When the ESD of a requisition on BO with status codes BB or B5 expires, a
              new ESD will be recomputed using the same criteria outlined above in this table
              (establishing BOs with status codes BB or B5).
              1.1. Mechanically established ESDs will be recomputed with the following
              frequency:
              1.1.1. Priority 01 – 08 BOs will be recomputed on the 15th and end of the month
              when the mechanical re-computation indicates a deviation of greater than 30 days
              from the current ESD.
              1.1.2. Priority 09 – 15 BOs will be recomputed at the end of the month when the
              mechanical re-computation indicates deviation of plus or minus 32 days from the
              current ESD.
              1.2. For a manually established ESD on a BO with status codes BB or B5, the
              system no longer attempts to mechanically update the ESD.
              2. When the ESD of a requisition on BO with status codes B4, BV or BZ status
              expires, D035A will output a “ZFY” transaction on a “7E” controlled exception

              2.1. For requisitions on BO with status code B4 or BZ, D035A will generate the
              “7E” controlled exception seven days prior to the expiration of the ESD.
              2.2. For requisitions on BO with status code BV, D035A will generate the “7E”
              controlled exception 45 days after the expiration of the ESD.
Follow-ups    Customers can follow-up for current status on BOs whether or not the ESD has
              expired. Follow-up transactions with DIC AF1 or AF5 that match a BO with
              status codes will be output on “7E” controlled exceptions for IM review/action
              IAW Chapter 8 when the ESD of the BO has expired; otherwise, D035A will
              reply with the current ESD.

Table 3.45. ESD Computation for MICAP Requisitions
Type Assignment        Description
Initial Assignment     1. D035A requires the user to specify an ESD as part of placing a
                       requisition on BO with status codes BV, BZ or B4.
                       2. When a MICAP requisition is backordered with status codes BB or
                       B5, D035A will output “BD” status DIC AE_ to the requisitioner with
                       an ESD of four days from the processing date.
                       3. The IM will take appropriate supply actions and input a valid ESD as
                       soon as possible but never later than four calendar days. This supply
                       action will cause the system to output new status to the requisitioner
                       superseding the “BD” status in the record.
Updating an Expired    1. The only time D035A mechanically assigns an ESD to a MICAP
ESD                    requisition is during the initial establishment of a BO; all other updates
                       to an ESD for a MICAP BO (whether expired or unexpired) will be
                       made manually by the IM.
                       2. The IM can use the BOAC or BOAE screens as shown in paragraph
                       13.4.3.3 to change the ESD for a BO with an unexpired ESD.
                       3. For an expired ESD, the IM will use the Controlled Exception,
                       (CEX) screen as detailed in Chapter 8 to work a “7E” controlled
                       exception D035A generates.
Follow-ups.            Customers can follow-up for current status on BOs whether or not the
                       ESD has expired:
                       1. For AF base MICAPs, SBSS will automatically follow-up when an
                       ESD expires.
                       2. For any follow-up on a MICAP requisition, D035A will provide the
                       latest supply status and ESD (whether expired or unexpired) unless the
                       follow-up matches a MICAP requisition with a mechanically-assigned

                        ESD.
                        2.1. When an AF_ follow-up transaction matches an initial MICAP
                        “BD” status transaction, D035A will output a “7E” controlled exception
                        in the “ZFY” format to the IM for review and action IAW Chapter 8.
                        2.2. As a result of working the “7E” controlled exception, D035A
                        outputs to the requisitioner both current status and an updated ESD as
                        provided by the IM.

3.13. MICAP Requisition Procedures.
   3.13.1. Initial processing of a MICAP requisition is as detailed in paragraph 3.3 unless the
   requisition is a contractor referral order (document number begins with “EY” or “EZ”).
   D035A checks whether the contractor DoDAAC is on a specific table as having authority to
   requisition using a MICAP designation. If the contractor’s DoDAAC is not on this table, any
   MICAP designation is removed from the requisition.
   3.13.2. When a MICAP requisition is placed on BO, the ESD is set to four days from the
   current processing date. DIC AE8 with status codes BD is output to DAAS for delivery to
   the requisitioning activity. The IM must take appropriate supply actions and input the true
   ESD as soon as possible but never later than four calendar days. This supply action will
   cause D035A to output new status to the requisitioner superseding the “BD” status in the
   record.
      3.13.2.1. SBSS and D035K automatically follow-up when the ESD expires on a
      backordered requisition. When DIC AF_ is received, D035A creates a “ZFY” transaction
      that is suspended as a “7E” controlled exception. The IM must clear this controlled
      exception within three calendar days for a MICAP requisition to prevent further follow-
      up attempts.
      3.13.2.2. The ESD established by the IM for a MICAP requisition is not automatically
      updated by D035A (see paragraph 3.12).
   3.13.3. Support Options. Because conditions affecting customer support for an item can be
   numerous and varied, it is not practical to give specific instructions for obtaining an asset to
   satisfy a MICAP condition. Table 3.46 details options for IMs to consider in support of
   MICAP, JCS and other high priority customer requisitions.

Options                     Description
Redistribute On-hand        1. Review data sources.
Balances                    1.1. Use the ES-S web application available on the AF portal to
                            view current retail asset balance data contained in SBSS and
                            D035K. To fill a MICAP requisition, an SBSS or D035K activity
                            may be taken below their RO.
                            1.2. If the ES-S web application is not available, use the SCS Web
                            Inquiry web application instead
                            (https://scsweb.day.disa.mil/sms_web/inquiry/AssetFrameset.htm).
                            The data displayed is pulled directly from RAMP (for SBSS
                            balances) and from D035K. The RAMP data is at least one day
                            old, but the D035K data is current.
                            2. If an available, serviceable retail asset is found, the base or
                            depot supply activity with the asset must be contacted off-line to
                            request shipment of the asset. If the asset is shipped, a degraded
                            operations shipment must be entered into D035A to show this
                            action.
                            3. If no available, serviceable retail asset is found, determine the
                            feasibility of shipping the NHA or a suitable substitute.
                            4. Review X-blocked items by calling storage locations to
                            determine if assets are available but not on record.
Repair Efforts              1. For current repair actions, contact repair source to expedite
                            repair action. These repair sources include organic, contractor and
                            DMISA activities.
                            2. Initiate interim/emergency repair from proven sources (organic
                            or contractor).
                            3. Review repair contract due-ins for possible ASI action.
                            4. Work with PMS to seek additional repair source.
                            5. Determine if the item can be locally manufactured.
Procurement Efforts         1. Expedite a current production contract, which could involve
                            offering premium pay/premium transportation for faster delivery.
                            2. Review production contract due-ins for possible ASI action.
                            3. Expedite first article inspection, if applicable.
                            4. Expedite purchase request award and delivery.
                            5. Initiate an interim/emergency buy from proven source.

                               6. Determine if the item can be locally purchased.
Miscellaneous                  1. Consider cannibalization from Aerospace Maintenance and
                               Regeneration Group (AMARG), depot maintenance, reclamation
                               projects, miscellaneous due-ins or withdrawal from disposal.
                               2. For an NSN used by another Service, consider obtaining a
                               serviceable asset through the other Service’s IM.
                               3. If the customer has a repair capability, consider shipping an
                               unserviceable asset.
                               4. Ensure all excess reports (DIC FTE) from FMS customers are
                               considered.
                               5. Generate an AFMC Form 206 to request depot maintenance
                               review assets in suspended conditions to determine if these items
                               are serviceable and can be used to support the customer.
                               6. Check DLA Disposition Services.
                               7. Check with LCO to determine if assets are due to be returned in
                               the near future.
                               8. Check with production and repair contractors or POs to
                               determine if a portion of their GFM could be returned.

   3.13.4. Screen MCP (MICAP Requisition Selection). IMs can use the MCP screen to
   interrogate for open MICAP requisitions by: action/status code; FSC/MMC; manager
   designator; priority; and/or DoDAAC. The resulting screen provides the IM with capability
   similar to what is found via the BOA screen.
3.14. Points of Sale (POS) or Transfer.
   3.14.1. Centralized Asset Management (CAM). CAM is a concept that applies to aircraft
   maintenance Cost Per Flying Hour (CPFH) supply accounts. Under centralization, retail-
   level supply accounts are no longer billed for each transaction. Instead, CPFH accounts are
   billed and paid monthly via the Flying Hour Reimbursement process. Reference AFI 23-101,
   Section 2C. Note: Normal business rules still apply to non-CPFH accounts.
   3.14.2. The five CSAG POS or transfer within AF supply systems are detailed in Table
   3.47.

From
Base Retail Base            1. When SBSS fills a request for materiel from a local customer
Supply       Maintenance    (e.g., base maintenance), a sale occurs.
(i.e., SBSS) Organization   1.1. For reparable materiel (i.e., an ERRC code “T” item), the
                            customer is charged the exchange price if a carcass turn-in is
                            anticipated; otherwise, the customer is charged the standard price.
                            1.2. For consumable materiel (i.e., an ERRC code “N” or “P”
                            item), the customer is charged the standard price.
                            1.3. SBSS is the system responsible for generating the financial
                            transaction required to create the bill.
                            2. When D035A fills a requisition from an SBSS customer (e.g.,
                            FB4613), there is no billing for the materiel shipped. Likewise, if
                            lateral support is used to move materiel from one base retail
                            supply activity to another base retail supply activity or from a
                            depot wholesale supply activity (e.g., FHB) to a base retail supply
                            activity, there is no billing for the materiel shipped.
                            2.1. In both cases, the shipment of materiel is treated as a transfer
                            out by the financial system.
                            2.2. This transfer out is offset in D035J by a transfer in, which
                            occurs when the shipment is receipted in by the receiving base
                            retail supply activity.
                            3. Because SBSS is never billed for a shipment of CSAG
                            materiel, no credit can be given to SBSS for return of materiel to
                            D035A.
                            3.1. If a base maintenance organization believes they are owed a
                            credit for turn-in of materiel, that issue must be resolved at the
                            local level.
                            3.2. Only SBSS can bill or credit a base maintenance

Supply      Organization   1.1. For reparable materiel, the customer is charged the exchange
(i.e.,                     price if a carcass turn-in is anticipated; otherwise, the customer is
D035K)                     charged the standard price.
                           1.2. For consumable materiel, the customer is charged the
                           standard price. D035K is the subsystem responsible for generating
                           the financial transaction required to create the bill.
                           2. When D035A fills a requisition from depot retail supply (e.g.,
                           FB2039), there is no billing for the materiel shipped or transferred
                           in place. Likewise, if lateral support is used to move materiel
                           from a base retail supply activity to a depot retail supply activity,
                           there is no billing for the materiel shipped.
                           2.1. In both cases, the shipment of materiel is treated as a transfer
                           out by D035J.
                           2.2. This transfer out is offset in D035J by a transfer in, which
                           occurs when the shipment is receipted in by D035K.
                           3. Because D035K is never billed for a shipment or transfer of
                           CSAG materiel, no credit can be given to a depot retail supply
                           activity for return of materiel to a depot wholesale supply activity.
                           3.1. If a depot maintenance organization believes they are owed a
                           credit for turn-in of materiel, that issue must be resolved within
                           D035K.
                           3.2. Only D035K can bill or credit a depot maintenance
                           organization.

                   customer, a sale occurs. For reparable or consumable materiel, the
                   non-capitalized customer is normally charged the standard price;
                   however, NASA, “EZ” and “EY” customers may be charged
                   exchange price under certain conditions. The exception to this
                   rule is shipments of GFM to an “EZ” customer using CAV. In this
                   case, the “EZ” customer is treated as a capitalized customer, so no
                   billing occurs.
                   2.1. If the materiel was shipped using D035K (IM-directed
                   shipment from AF depot stock), D035K is responsible for
                   generating the financial transaction required to create the bill.
                   D035K relies on the data provided by D035A on the RDO
                   transaction with DIC A2_ to generate the correct financial
                   transaction; so, the shipment will not be initiated by direct input
                   into D035K.
                   2.2. If the materiel was shipped using SBSS (IM-directed
                   shipment from a base retail supply activity), D035A is responsible
                   for generating the financial transaction required to create the bill;
                   however, SBSS also creates a financial transaction. SBSS relies
                   on the data provided by D035A in the RDO to generate the correct
                   transfer out financial transaction; so, the shipment will not be
                   initiated by direct input into SBSS.
                   2.3. If the materiel was shipped from a non-AF wholesale depot
                   storage facility using D035A (e.g., BY6), D035A is responsible
                   for generating the financial transaction required to create the bill.
                   The shipment will not be initiated by direct input into the storage

                           production contractor) transaction is posted within D035A via the

                           treated by D035A and D035K as a “free issue” shipment to a non-

                           FMS customer is normally charged the standard price; however,
                           they may be granted a discount price.
                           2.1. If the materiel was shipped using D035K, D035K is
                           responsible for generating the financial transaction that shows the
                           issue of materiel, but no bill is generated at this time. When
                           D035A receives the shipment confirmation transaction from
                           D035K, a copy is passed to D035J to create the bill.

                           facility, D035A is responsible for generating the financial
                           transaction that shows the issue of materiel, but no bill is
                           generated at this time. When D035A receives the shipment
                           confirmation transaction from the storage facility, a copy is passed
                           to D035J to create the bill.

                           create the bill. The IM must ensure that a “ZKM” or “ZKS” is
                           posted within D035A via the CFDA screen in this situation. See
                           paragraph 13.6.1.1 for a sample format.
                           2.4. If no shipment confirmation is posted in D035A, then the

                           IMs must ensure shipment confirmation transactions are posted in

                             1.1.1. For the sale of reparable materiel, the customer is charged
                             the exchange price if a carcass turn-in is anticipated; otherwise, the
                             customer is charged standard price.
                             1.1.2. For the sale of consumable materiel, the customer is
                             charged the standard price.
                             1.1.3. The issue transaction generated by CAV-AF is forwarded
                             to a special instance of SBSS, which is responsible for generating
                             the financial transaction required to create the bill.
                             1.2. Transfer Out. 1.2.1. Because the materiel is installed on an
                             end item undergoing maintenance and is therefore no longer
                             tracked as inventory on-hand, the materiel must be expensed by
                             the financial system.
                             1.2.2. The issue transaction generated by CAV-AF is forwarded

                             the financial transaction required to create the expense action.
                             2. Any credits that may occur when GFM is turned in also occur
                             based on CAV-AF passing the appropriate receipt transaction to a
                             special instance of SBSS.
                             2.1. Because a DIPEM customer is never billed for a shipment of
                             GFM, no credit can be given to this customer based on a return of
                             GFM to D035A.
                             2.2. If a DIPEM customer believes they are owed a credit for turn-
                             in of GFM, that issue must be resolved within CAV-AF and the
                             associated special instance of SBSS.

   3.15.1. Normally, when an item is no longer used, the AAC is changed to “Y,” “Terminal
   Item” (no longer issued), and the phrase code is changed to “N.” The combination of this

     3.15.2. A customer can override this reject logic by citing advice code 2F which indicates
     they are aware that the item is obsolete but a requirement still exists. In processing these
     requisitions, D035A will attempt to release available assets for shipment and then place the
     unfilled quantity on BO. A BO notification titled “Backorder on DSP Item, No Assets” will
     be produced. Upon receipt of this notification the IM will process as follows:
         3.15.2.1. Research all sources (e.g., procurement, fabrication, DLA Disposition Services)
         to obtain the quantity required to satisfy the request. Take appropriate action to input
         sufficient assets to D035A to permit release of the BO.
         3.15.2.2. If assets are not available from any known source, but a substitute item has
         been identified, process as follows:
            3.15.2.2.1. If the substitute item is managed by the AF, contact the requisitioner
            requesting acceptance or rejection of the substitute. If requisitioner agrees to accept
            the substitute item, release the substitute item for shipment (See paragraph 13.4.5
            for a sample format); otherwise, cancel the requisition with status code CB (See
            paragraph 13.4.1 for a sample format).

          3.15.2.2.2. If the substitute item is managed by a non-AF ICP (i.e., DLA, GSA or an
          OS/A), initiate a passing action. See paragraph 13.4.4 for a sample format.
3.16. Programmed vs. Non-Programmed Requisitions.
   3.16.1. In order to prevent excessive drain of AF assets, requisitions are divided into two
   classifications within D035A: programmed and non-programmed. Requisitions related to an
   established and recognized AF mission, function or capability follow programmed
   processing logic. Requisitions from Other Service FMS, requisitions manually entered with

Table 3.49. Programmed and Non-Programmed Requisition Processing
Type Requisition   Description
Programmed         1. Types of programmed requisitions are:
                   1.1. All AF requisitions with service code “E” or “F” in the first position
                   of the document number.
                   1.2. AF FMS requisitions with a “D” in the first position of the document
                   number, which have been passed from SAMIS and have management
                   code 1 in rp 72 of the document. See paragraph 3.5 for further details
                   regarding FMS requisitions.
                   1.3. Initial Spares Support Packages (ISSP) requisitions.
                   1.4. MUCO requisitions having DoDAACs beginning with “FN.”
                   1.5. Other S/A requisitions for EOQ items whose service code matches
                   the JMC for the requested item.
                   1.6. Any requisition for items with assets above the control level.
                   1.7. A reinstated requisition resulting from a denial.
                   1.8. Any requisition manually input using a manager action code other
                   than “NP.”
                   1.9. A request from a DMISA repair activity for materiel to complete a
                   repair.
                   2. Levels. Programmed requisitions with priority designators 09 – 15 will
                   be shipped until assets reach the support level. Further explanation of
                   levels used within D035A can be found in Chapter 5.
Non-Programmed     1. Types of non-programmed requisitions are:
                   1.1. Other Service FMS requisitions with “B,” “K,” “P” or “T” in the first
                   position of the document number and which have been passed from
                   SAMIS. These are excluded from JMC coding and are, therefore,
                   considered non-programmed requisitions.
                   1.2. Other S/A requisitions whose service code is not recorded as a user
                   as indicated by the JMC for the requested item.
                   1.3. Requisitions that contain an “A,” “S” or “X” in the first position of
                   the RDD. The second and third positions of the RDD indicate the number
                   of months before the materiel is required.
                   1.3.1. FMS requisitions that contain an “A” in the first position of the
                   RAD indicate the number of months from the date of the requisition the
                   requested materiel is to be available for release to the FMS customer. The
                   actual date of materiel availability will be the last day of the month

Type Requisition   Description
                   depicted by numerics.
                   1.3.2. Requisitions that are deferred by the customer (RDD > S01 and <
                   S99) will process as non-programmed and have the NPSD set.
                   1.4. FMS requisitions with an alpha, blank or “2” in the management
                   code field.
                   1.5. The NPSD for FMS “NP” requisitions with “H” in the first position
                   of the document number serial number is calculated as the current date
                   plus 180 days. 1.6. Any requisition manually input using a manager
                   action “NP.”
                   1.7. Non-Programmed requisitions become programmed requisitions for
                   one of the following reasons:
                   1.7.1. The requisition is on BO and available assets go above the Control
                   Level.
                   1.7.2. The requisition is on BO and the NPSD has expired.
                   1.7.3. The requisition is on BO and the action code is manually changed
                   from NP to BV, BZ or B4.
                   1.8. D035A prevents partial shipments on “NP” requisitions that are not
                   part of an I&SG relationship; instead, the system creates a non-
                   programmed requirement (“9C”) controlled exception containing the
                   original quantity.
                   2. Levels. Non-Programmed BOs may be released once assets go above
                   the control level.
                   2.1. Control and support levels are provided by the requirements systems.
                   These levels are designed to control and schedule AF support of non-
                   programmed requirements, thus insuring adequate support to all
                   customers. The IM may establish control and support levels for EOQ and
                   investment items, which will override the levels provided by the
                   requirements systems. See Chapter 5 for preparation of the file
                   maintenance transaction with DIC “ZFL” and use of levels.
                   2.2. Non-Programmed requisitions will be processed automatically by
                   D035A as long as the asset position is above the established control level.
                   When the asset position drops below the control level, non-programmed
                   requisitions will be backordered mechanically with action code NP except
                   for requisitions from AF, an OS/A with no lead time on the NSN items
                   record or if it is a MICAP requirement which, in turn, will be assigned a
                   “9C” non-programmed requirement controlled exception.
                   2.3. Non-Programmed FMS requisitions can be manually released for
                   shipment when the asset position is below the control level; however,
                   extreme care must be exercised. DoD recognizes shipment of non-
                   programmed requisitions from stock which is below control levels as a

                    requirements is not adversely affected. See paragraph 3.5 for further
                    details on processing FMS requisitions.

3.17. Requisitions for Items with DoD I&SG Relationships.
   3.17.1. See paragraph 2.2.1.2 for introductory information regarding I&SG relationships.
   3.17.2. The following examples describe how different types of I&SG families function:
      3.17.2.1. Table 3 50 shows a basic I&SG relationship. This family contains a single
      I&SG subgroup. The I&SG subgroup code is AA which shows that all these items are in
      the same I&SG relationship. The third position is the PPC identifies the more preferred
      items. With the PPC, the higher the letter is in the alphabet (ascending order) the more
      preferred the designated item. In this example, the item with OOU code AAF is the most
      preferred while the item with OOU code AAA is the least preferred. Remember that
      items in the same I&SG subgroup are two-way interchangeable. The item with OOU
      code AAA is interchangeable with the item with OOU code AAD, which is
      interchangeable with the item with OOU code AAB; i.e., any item in the same I&SG
      subgroup can replace any other item in the I&SG subgroup. Note: If a requisition was
      received for the item with OOU code AAD, D035A would search through the entire
      I&SG subgroup looking for available assets and if no assets were found the requisition
      would be placed on BO on the I&SG subgroup master (i.e., the item with OOU code
      AAF).

      3.17.2.2. A slightly more complicated family is shown in Table 3.51 This family has
      two I&SG subgroups (AA and AB). There is one-way interchangeability between I&SG
      subgroups. That is, assets for the item with OOU code AAC cannot be used to support
      requisitions for items with OOU code ABC; however, assets for the item with OOU code
      ABC can be used to support requisitions for the item with OOU code AAC.
      Additionally, all items in each I&SG Subgroup are interchangeable with each other just
      as shown in Table 3.50 (i.e., assets on the item with OOU code ABC can be used to
      support requisitions for items with OOU codes ABD or ABA). Remember that the

       higher is the letter in the alphabet, the more preferred the item is in the OOU. Note: If a
       requisition is received for the item with OOU code AAB, any of the items in its I&SG
       subgroup and the next higher I&SG Subgroup could be used to fill the requisition; but, if
       no assets are available, the requisition would be placed on BO for the I&SG subgroup
       master (the item with OOU code AAC). Additionally, if a requisition was received for an
       item in I&SG subgroup AB and no assets were available, the requisition would be placed
       on BO under the I&SG subgroup master NSN with OOU code ABD.

       3.17.2.3. Table 3 52 shows how the Jump to Code functions. If a requisition is received
       for the item with OOU code AAA and no stock was available on the two items in I&SG
       subgroup AA, the logic would jump down to the item with OOU code ADA. Jump to
       codes bypass normal logic. It does not mean subgroups AB and AC are not good; rather,
       it means that they will not be used as substitute items in I&SG subgroup AA.

       3.17.2.4. Table 3 53 shows how NPPC 9 works. Items coded with an OOU having
       NPPC 9 are always the least preferred because they are unacceptable for AF use. Also,
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                               201


      when there is an NPPC on an item, it is the only one in its I&SG subgroup. Items with an
      OOU having an NPPC can also have a Jump to Code.

      AB4 is being modified and will no longer be issued in its present configuration. The

       3.17.2.7. Table 3 56 shows the U.S. Army OOU code RRR for an item in the I&SG
       family. This code signifies the Service is a registered user of the item but has not
       supplied the IM or the PICA with an OOU code. OOU code RRR appears for Services
       other than AF on items for which the AF is the PICA.

       3.17.2.8. Table 3 57 shows OOU ZZZ appears when the AF has no retail use of the item
       but is the PICA and is managing the item only for the use by Other Services because of
       the relationship between it and other items in the I&SG family. OOU code XXX means
       the AF is the PICA and only uses the Master NSN for the family; all other AF items in
       that I&SG family must also have OOU code ZZZ.

         3.17.3.4. Substitution will be attempted on both FMS programmed grant aid and FMS
         programmed requisitions if the FMS requisitions do not contain advice code 2J.
         3.17.3.5. The IM will review and process BOs for I&SG items as follows:
            3.17.3.5.1. In collaboration with the standardization component, determine the
            correctness of the NPPC. If the NPPC is incorrect, initiate corrective action (e.g.,
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                205


          change the NPPC or remove the item from the I&SG family). If assets are available,
          initiate degraded operations actions and manually prepare shipping documentation.
          3.17.3.5.2. If the NPPC is correct, the BO contains advice code 2F and assets are
          available, initiate a degraded operations shipment.
          3.17.3.5.3. If the NPPC is correct but the BO does not contain advice code 2F, query
          the customer to determine if the item is acceptable in its present state; if so, take
          action to initiate a degraded operations shipment.
          3.17.3.5.4. If no action can be taken to supply the item, cancel the BO with status
          code CA and advise the customer of the circumstances. See paragraph 13.4.1 for a
          sample format.
3.18. Readiness Spares Packages (RSP) Requisitions.
   3.18.1. Requisitions for base level RSP requirements contain AF project code 122 or 123
   and can contain priority designator 04-15. RSP requisitions containing RDD XXX are for
   initial fills. Requisitions that only cite project code 122 or 123without RDD XXX are
   recurring demands.
   3.18.2. AF project code 122 or 123 will only be supported mechanically using SCC A
   materiel. If the requisition is backordered and SCC B or C materiel is available, a class
   notification is produced to advise the IM.
   3.18.3. RSP requisitions will not be cancelled by the IM without coordination/concurrence
   of the applicable MAJCOM and the PM.
3.19. Backorder Processing for Items Changing Between Non-Stock Fund and Stock Fund.
   3.19.1. Change from Non-Stock Fund to Stock Fund.
      3.19.1.1. Capitalized Customer Orders. All AF BOs, service codes “E” and “F,” for
      capitalized activities will have assigned FC “6C” for BC “9” items or FC “64” for BC “8”
      items.
      3.19.1.2. Non-Capitalized Customer Orders. Properly funded BOs will be retained.
          3.19.1.2.1. BC “8” item BOs will be rejected with status code CM when the FC is
          blank or invalid and with status code CX when the signal code is invalid.
          3.19.1.2.2. BC “9” item BOs will be passed to the correct ICP. FMS programmed
          requisition BOs will be assigned FC “NS”’ prior to action. BOs for LP and LM items
          will be rejected with status code CP.
   3.19.2. Change from Stock Fund to Non-Stock Fund. When the category of an item changes
   from stock funded to non-stock funded, status code BN is furnished to the customer for all
   BOs on the item.
3.20. SICA Requisitions for Other Service Managed Investment Items.
   3.20.1. Assignment of NIMSC 5 indicates that AF is a SICA and Another Service is PICA
   for the item under the nonconsumable item program for multi-Service used items. Item
   specifications have been reviewed by the using Service(s) and the PICA has agreed to
 206                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


   support the SICA Service(s) requirement for the NIMSC 5 items when a funded requisition is
   received.
   3.20.2. The IM can attempt to support the requirement from shipping assets out of wholesale
   stock or retail excess.
   3.20.3. If assets are not available, the IM will ensure the signal code and FC are updated
   prior to passing a requisition to the PICA (see paragraphs 3.3.2.9, 3.3.2.10 and 3.4.2.2.2.3).
       3.20.3.1. For NIMSC 5 requisitions, the PICA sends D035A Supply (XZ6) and/or
       Shipment Status (X2T) transactions for either a full or a partial quantity:
          3.20.3.1.1. The status code can indicate the requisition is being processed (BB or
          BA), cancelled (BQ, BR or BS), or rejected (C_).
          3.20.3.1.2. The shipment status will include the Transportation Control Number
          (TCN) and other shipping information.
       3.20.3.2. Users with D035A OPR level access can input cancellation requests as well as
       post Supply and Shipment Status for NIMSC 5 requisitions passed to the PICA.
          3.20.3.2.1. Use the STAE screen to input a cancellation transaction (DIC AC3). See
          paragraph 13.7.5 for a sample format.
          3.20.3.2.2. Use the STAF screen to input a “XZ6” supply status transaction. See
          paragraph 13.7.3 for a sample format.
          3.20.3.2.3. Use the STAG screen to input a “X2T” Shipment Status transaction. See
          paragraph 13.7.4 for a sample format.
       3.20.3.3. NIMSC 5 requisitions that are passed to the PICA are not always closed.
       Those requisitions for which a supply status or shipment status is required from the PICA
       will stay in open state. D035A sends D035J an Inventory Due-In (F6U) transaction for
       each NIMSC 5 requisition that remains open. The following NIMSC 5 requisitions will
       not be closed when passed to the PICA:
          3.20.3.3.1. Requisitions against which the materiel is being shipped to a capitalized
          customer.
          3.20.3.3.2. CAV-AF requisitions for GFM. The FC and signal codes will remain
          unchanged when the requisition is passed to the PICA.
          3.20.3.3.3. Requisitions where the materiel is being shipped to a “FY” DoDAAC.

3.21. Supply and Shipment Status Processing.
   3.21.1. This paragraph explains the various processes in D035A that produce requisition
   supply status and shipment status transactions.
       3.21.1.1. Status Routing. D035A relies on DAAS to deliver status transactions to the
       appropriate data processing systems. D035A transmits a supply status transaction (DIC
       AE8) or a shipment status transaction (DIC AS8) to DAAS. DAAS then uses the M&S
       code on these transactions to determine where to forward the transactions.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                     207


            3.21.1.1.1. If the M&S code on the status transaction indicates that the organization
            identified by the DoDAAC in the requisition document number field wants status,
            then DAAS will forward a status transaction (DIC AE1 or AS1) to that organization.
            3.21.1.1.2. If the M&S code on the status transaction indicates that the organization
            identified by the DoDAAC in the requisition SUPADD field wants status, DAAS will
            forward a status transaction (DIC AE2 or AS2) to that organization.
            3.21.1.1.3. If the status transaction contains a valid distribution code field, then
            DAAS will forward a status transaction (DIC AE3 or AS3) to the organization
            identified by the distribution code. For a requisition document number that begins
            with “D,” D035A always inserts distribution code N into the status transaction to
            ensure that SAMIS receives the required status transaction.
         3.21.1.2. Exemptions. D035A will not produce status transactions for any requisition
         processed to force a shipment of materiel using an action code of “O2,” “V3,” or “VD.”
3.21.2. Table 3.59 details Supply Status and Shipment Status processing.


Table 3.59. Supply and Shipment Status Processing
Type Status     Description
Supply          1. Whenever D035A establishes, modifies or cancels a requisition record, a
                Supply Status transaction (DIC AE8) is transmitted to DAAS. This also occurs
                whenever a requisition follow-up transaction (DIC AF_ or AT_) is processed by
                D035A.
                1.1. If a new requisition transaction (DIC A0_, A3_, and A4_) is suspended as a
                controlled exception awaiting IM action, D035A will transmit DIC AE8 with
                status code BD to DAAS. As long as the controlled exception exists, all follow-
                up transactions received will also cause D035A to transmit DIC AE8 with status
                code BD to DAAS.
                1.2. If a requisition is placed into status code BA, D035A will transmit DIC AE8
                with status code BA to DAAS. If a follow-up transaction is received for this
                requisition, D035A will transmit DIC AE8 with status code BA to DAAS as long
                as no shipment confirmation transaction has posted. This means that a follow-up
                transaction against a denied shipment still results in the customer receiving status
                code BA, because there is no status code to tell the customer that the shipment
                attempt failed.
                1.3. If a requisition is placed on BO, D035A will transmit DIC AE8 with status
                code BB to DAAS. Even if the internal D035A BO status code is B4, B5 or NP,
                status code BB will be on the “AE8” transaction; however, status codes BV and
                BZ will be used by D035A to create an “AE8” transaction.
                1.4. If a requisition is passed to another SOS for action, D035A will transmit DIC
                AE8 transaction with status code BM to DAAS.
                1.5. If a requisition is cancelled or rejected, D035A will transmit DIC AE8 with
 208                                                    AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


Type Status   Description
              specific cancellation or rejection status code to DAAS.
              1.6. If a requisition cancellation transaction (DIC AC_ or AK_) cannot be
              immediately processed (e.g., BO has status code BV or BZ), D035A will transmit
              DIC AE8 with status code B9 to DAAS. If the requisition cannot be cancelled
              (e.g., attempt to stop shipment failed), D035A will transmit DIC AE8 with status
              code B8 to DAAS.
              2. D035A will transmit a second “AE8” transaction to DAAS as follows:
              2.1. If the IM used action codes V1, V6 or V8 to ship a substitute or
              interchangeable NSN, D035A will transmit DIC AE8 with status code BH to
              DAAS.
              2.2. If D035A automatically changed the requisitioned P/N to the correct NSN,
              D035A will transmit DIC AE8 with status code BG to DAAS.
              2.3. If D035A automatically changed the requisitioned quantity and UI, D035A
              will transmit DIC AE8 with status code BG to DAAS.
              2.4. If D035A automatically changed the requisitioned quantity to conform to the
              unit pack quantity, D035A will transmit DIC AE8 with status code BJ to DAAS.
              2.5. If D035A automatically changed the signal code and/or FC for a requisition
              from a SBSS customer, D035A will transmit DIC AE8 with status code FQ to
              DAAS.
              2.6. If the BO contains a deferred RDD (i.e., S01 through S99 or X01 through
              X99), D035A will transmit DIC AE8 with status code BP to DAAS.
              2.7. If a requisition modifier transaction (DIC AM_) successfully updated a
              requisition in D035A, D035A will transmit DIC AE8 with status code BK to
              DAAS.
              3. If the IM uses status code CA to cancel a BO, D035A requires that a text
              explanation for the cancellation be entered into the system. Although D035A will
              transmit DIC AE8 with status code CA to DAAS, the text explanation is not sent
              to the customer because there is no room for remarks in the standard MILSTRIP
              format used to transmit status.
              4. D035A records a copy of all “AE8” transactions transmitted to DAAS to the
              Daily Transaction History database. These transactions can be viewed using the
              DODB screen menu option.
              5. The IM can force D035A to transmit an “AE8” transaction to DAAS by using
              the D035A STAA menu option. The IM must enter the document number and
              suffix code of an existing requisition. See paragraphs 13.4.7, 13.5.3, 13.6.8 and
              13.7.2 for sample formats.
Shipment      1. When materiel is shipped in response to an MRO or RDO from D035A, it is
              the responsibility of the shipping system to transmit DIC AS_ to DAAS. For this
              reason, D035A does not use a shipment confirmation transaction it receives from
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                  209


Type Status   Description
              the shipping system to transmit DIC AS8 to DAAS; however, in response to a
              later follow-up transaction from the customer, D035A will use a shipment
              confirmation transaction to transmit DIC AS8 to DAAS.
              2. If D035A processes DIC ARH due to non-response from the shipping activity,
              D035A will transmit DIC ASH to DAAS. For a contractor GFM requisition,
              D035A will also transmit a copy of the “ASH” transaction to the SSSC system
              through an MQ interface.
              3. The IM can force D035A to transmit DIC AS8 to DAAS by using the D035A
              “FUPA” menu option. The IM must enter the document number and suffix code
              of an existing requisition that has a shipment confirmation posted against it. See
              paragraphs 13.4.6.1, 13.6.5 and 13.7.1 for sample formats.

                                            Chapter 4

                                       PART NUMBERS

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. This chapter outlines the actions required to provide depot wholesale supply support
   for P/N or Non-Stock Listed (NSL) NSN items, including research requirements, data
   accumulation, supply responsibility, follow-on supply action, etc.
   4.1.2. These procedures are directed to AFMC ICP individuals responsible for P/N
   processing and who will be referred to in this chapter as “Processors.” Processors include the
   central focal point on a P/N requisition as well as additional support personnel needed to
   action a customer order to completion (e.g., identify/establish a pertinent NSN, determine
   technical applicability of an item, reject/cancel/pass the order, submit registrations for non-
   AF-managed items, perform AF PICA or SICA duties, etc.).
   4.1.3. Due to differences in organizational structure at each AFMC ICP, internal routing of
   the P/N package may vary and must be documented locally. Note: Deviation from
   procedures in this chapter must not result in un-actioned orders within D035A (i.e., all type
   “1C” [P/N requisition] controlled exceptions must be worked as part of the order-handling
   process).
4.2. DLA Customer Interaction Center (CIC). The DLA CIC has established a helpline to
assist any activity with P/N research. The CIC helpline is available 24 hours a day and can be
accessed via: https://www.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/cust.asp.
4.3. Customer Requirement. Although guidance used by customers in determining which
supply support procedures to apply in filling a requirement are detailed elsewhere (e.g., AFMAN
23-122 for base retail customers, Volume 4, Wholesale and Retail Receiving/Shipping (WARRS)
System Users’ Manual (D035K/L), for depot retail customers, binding contracts and service
agreements for repair and production contractors, etc.), the following provides an overview of
the decision-making process which could result in customer initiation of a P/N requisition.
   4.3.1. Identify Stock Number. After the need for a particular part has been identified, the
   customer reviews applicable weapon or system technical orders, technical manuals, system
   manager catalogs or parts lists to determine whether the required item has already been
   assigned an NSN. If so, the customer sends a requisition transaction for the required stock
   listed item to the applicable SOS.
   4.3.2. Consider LP/LM. If the required part has not yet been assigned an NSN, the customer
   may attempt LP or LM if one or more of the following conditions are met:
       4.3.2.1. The part is a standard commercial item.
       4.3.2.2. The part is an investment item intended for initial installation.
       4.3.2.3. The part is a non-logical spare for one-time use only.
       4.3.2.4. The part applies to a weapon system that is command-supported.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                 211


   4.3.3. Initiate P/N Requisition. If the required part is neither stock listed nor obtainable
   through LP/LM, the customer will order the item using the following P/N requisitioning
   procedures:
      4.3.3.1. Determine Destination. The customer will send a P/N requisition to AF or DLA
      SOSs as appropriate. Note: There is always the potential for a customer to mistakenly
      send a P/N requisition to the wrong supply source. Procedures for handling this
      possibility are included in paragraphs 4.4.2.1 and 4.4.3.2.1.
          4.3.3.1.1. To identify to where to send a P/N requisition, the customer must
          determine/consider the following:
              4.3.3.1.1.1. If the item is recorded in an applicable TO.
              4.3.3.1.1.2. If the item is a category “B” crystal to be ordered using MICAP
              procedures.
              4.3.3.1.1.3. If the part is an FMS-Peculiar item.
              4.3.3.1.1.4. If source coding identifies the item as a logical spare.
              4.3.3.1.1.5. If the applicable FSC is identified during item management coding.
          4.3.3.1.2. Customers will use criteria in Table 4.1 to identify where to send P/N
          requisitions.

Table 4.1. Determining P/N Requisition Destination
P/N Requisition Destination     Description
Robins ICP                      Item is a category “B” crystal to be ordered using MICAP
                                procedures
                                Robins ICP is the applicable TO/EA/FSC Site
Site for FMS Nonstandard        Item identified by:
Items of Supply (aka FMS-       1.   MMACs EX or XT through XZ

                                   Peculiar at Hill ICP) or F8U (FMS-Peculiar at Tinker ICP).
                                Note: Generally, the AF has no requirement for these items and
                                is acting only as a procuring agent for the FMS customer;
                                however, AF bases are authorized to submit off-line P/N
                                requisitions in MILSTRIP format by message to the appropriate
                                Sites for FMS-Peculiar items if, after thorough research, the
                                bases believe the FMS-Peculiar items may be logical spares for
                                AF use. AF bases must fully justify their requirements by citing
                                TO, figure and index. If the items are non-aircraft type items
                                and not reflected in TOs, AF bases will cite FSC, type of item,
                                application and a description of the mission that will not be
                                performed if the item is not cataloged for AF use.

P/N Requisition Destination     Description
TO/EA Site                      Customers will send P/N requisitions to the applicable TO/EA
                                Site (FGZ, FHZ, FLZ, and FPD) if any of the following applies:
                                1. Logical spares for items which, when stock listed, would be
                                managed by the TO/EA Site (local prime).
                                2. Non-logical spares for which the decision is made to provide
                                support on a one-time basis and which will be assigned an
                                “ND” control number. See AFMCMAN 23-3, Cataloging and
                                Standardization, Chapter 6.
                                3. MICAP requisitions for items that would be non-AF
                                managed if cataloged. Note: See above for unique processing
                                of MICAPs and other requisitions for category “B” crystals.
FSC Site                        Customers will send P/N requisitions to the applicable FSC Site
                                (RIC FGZ, FHZ, FLZ or FPD) if either of the following applies:
                                1. Item is determined to be a logical spare which, when
                                cataloged, becomes AF managed and FSC prime.
                                2. Item management coding determines that FSC 5955 applies.
                                Note: Upon receipt of three or more requisitions at the FSC Site
                                for a category “B” crystal P/N, the item will be assumed to be a
                                logical spare and cataloging action must be initiated.

       4.3.3.2. Determine Format and Place Order.
           4.3.3.2.1. DICs A02/A0B. The customer will submit a P/N requisition via a system-
           to-system transaction to the appropriate site as determined in paragraph 4.3.3.1.2
           using DIC A02 or A0B if all of the following conditions are met:
              4.3.3.2.1.1. The manufacturer’s Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE)
              code can be identified.
              4.3.3.2.1.2. The P/N is no more than 10 characters long.
              4.3.3.2.1.3. The item is recorded in an applicable TO.
           4.3.3.2.2. DICs A05/A0E. The customer will submit a P/N requisition via non-
           transactional means (i.e., mail, message, E-mail, fax or telephone) to the appropriate
           site as determined in paragraph 4.3.3.1.2 using DIC A05 or A0E if any of the
           conditions listed in paragraph 4.3.3.2.1 are not met. The requisition package must
           include the full P/N and descriptive supporting text.
4.4. AFMC ICP P/N Requisition Processes.
   4.4.1. Initial Processing of DIC A02/A0B Requisition Transaction. Requisition transactions
   received at AFMC ICPs enter and are edited by D035A:
       4.4.1.1. Match to NSN on Part Number Cross Reference (PNCR) File. If Reference
       Number (CAGE + P/N) information in the requisition matches an existing type “B” or
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                   213


     “C” PNCR record, D035A automatically converts it to an NSN and treats it as a
     requisition with DIC A01/A0A (e.g., processed within the D035A domain that originally
     received the P/N requisition or passed to the NSN item ICP). A “1C” controlled
     exception will not generate. See Chapter 3 for NSN requisition processing procedures.
     4.4.1.2. Reject.   D035A may have sufficient information to cause it to reject a
     requisition:
         4.4.1.2.1. P/N requisitions received in “L” or “P” number formats (as used by AF
         base and depot retail activities) will be automatically rejected as incorrectly formatted
         only if the remainder of the information provided on the requisition is inadequate for
         further processing.
         4.4.1.2.2. Requisition has advice code 2C.
         4.4.1.2.3. Requisition has an invalid CAGE code.
         4.4.1.2.4. Requisition has invalid TO information.
         4.4.1.2.5. Requisition matches to an “F” type PNCR record (a constant reject code
         applies).
         4.4.1.2.6. Requisition cites no TO and/or no end item application. D035A will reject
         requisitions when these fields are blank.
     4.4.1.3. Suspend. P/N requisitions not converted to or processed as NSN requisitions
     and not automatically rejected are suspended in D035A as type “1C” controlled
     exceptions. See paragraph 4.4.3 for “1C” controlled exception processing procedures.
  4.4.2. Initial Processing of DIC A05/A0E Off-line Requisition. Processors receive P/N
  requisitions with DIC A0E/A05 via mail, message, E-mail, fax or telephone. As needed,
  Processors will contact the customer for additional information required regarding any P/ N
  package. The applicable Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) Customer Service Office
  (CSO) will be the POC for P/N packages initiated by an AF base customer unless an alternate
  name and phone number are specified within the package.
     4.4.2.1. Receiving AFMC ICP is Incorrect Processing Site.
         4.4.2.1.1. If documentation provided by the customer is sufficient for Processors at
         the initial site to identify the correct TO/EA Site, they will forward the P/N package
         to that processing site. An initial site can mail a P/N requisition package including a
         blueprint to another site to determine method of support. If the second site authorizes
         the initial site to support locally, the TO/EA Site will return all blueprints and
         pertinent data with the P/N package to the initial site. The initial site must be able to
         include the blueprint with the P/N processing package to support the requirement
         through local manufacture, local procurement or cataloging action.
         4.4.2.1.2. If documentation provided by the customer is insufficient for Processors to
         identify the correct TO/EA Site, they will return the P/N package to the requisitioner
         with instructions to resubmit with additional documentation as needed to the correct
         TO/EA Site.

         4.4.2.2.1. Initial Review and Action. Processors will review the P/N package for
         completeness, contacting the customer for clarification/additional information as
         necessary. If the CAGE and/or P/N are determined to be incorrect, Processors will
         attempt to identify the correct Reference Number.
             4.4.2.2.1.1. If the information is complete and valid, Processors will use the
             D035A PTN screen to input the requisition, substituting DIC A0B/A02 for
             A0E/A05 respectively in the Document ID field. See paragraph 13.3.1.
             4.4.2.2.1.2. If the data includes CAGE Code ZZZZZ or blanks in record position
             (rp) 8-12 and the remainder of the information is adequate for processing,
             Processors will use the D035A PTN screen to input the requisition, making the
             following substitutions: use DIC A0B/A02 for A0E/A05 respectively in the
             Document ID field; and use “00000” in the FSCM field. See paragraph 13.3.1.
             4.4.2.2.1.3. If the correct CAGE and/or P/N cannot be determined, Processors
             will return the P/N package to the requisitioner with instructions to resubmit with
             corrected information to the correct TO/EA Site.
         4.4.2.2.2. See paragraph 4.4.1 regarding D035A automated processing of P/N
         requisitions input with DIC A0B/A02 via the D035A PTN screen.
  4.4.3. Processing “1C” Controlled Exceptions. See paragraph 4.5 for required PNCR
  updates.
      4.4.3.1. Time Standards and Process Completion. Customer support dictates timely
      processing of all exceptions by all organizations. The volume of “1C” controlled
      exceptions generated for P/N requisitions received at each site will vary; however,
      routine P/N requisition total processing time will not exceed 30 days. MICAP total
      processing time will not exceed eight hours. Recurring problems associated with P/N
      requisitions contribute to processing delays. Document each problem and elevate it
      through the appropriate supply chain. Each area processing the “1C” controlled
      exception package will ensure all necessary actions on the package are completed prior to
      passing to the next area. When the package is received for processing within one area,
      review it for completeness and, if necessary, return it to the appropriate area for rework.
      4.4.3.2. Detailed Procedures. See also Chapter 8 for detailed procedures in using the
      correction and manager action options to clear “1C” controlled exceptions.
         4.4.3.2.1. Receiving Site is Incorrect Processing Site. If D035A suspended a P/N
         requisition transaction with DIC A0B/A02 on a type “1C” controlled exception and
         Processors determine either the receiving site is not the correct TO/EA/FSC Site or
         find through research that the item is identified to a lower indentured TO managed at
         another TO/EA/FSC Site, they will use Manager Action “CA” to work the “1C”
         controlled exception and advise the customer in writing (i.e., via E-mail, letter,
         message, etc.) to submit a new requisition with a new document number to the site
         that is prime for the pertinent TO/EA/FSC.
         4.4.3.2.2. Receiving Site is Correct Processing Site. For all “1C” controlled
         exceptions generated within D035A at the correct TO/EA Site, Processors will use
         source coding to determine if the item is a logical spare (see Table 4.2, Table 4.3,
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                     215


          Table 4.4 and Table 4.7). Each item will also be item management coded (see DoD
          4140.26-M, DoD Integrated Materiel Management (IMM) for Consumable Items,
          Volume 1) and assigned an FSC.

     4.4.4. Manage Customer Cancellations. Customers may generate requisition cancellation
     transactions DIC AC1 to the Site that last provided supply status. See paragraph 4.6 for
     required PNCR updates.
          4.4.4.1. Mechanical Processing. If the CAGE, P/N and quantity in the customer
          cancellation transaction match D035A document records, the P/N requisition is
          mechanically canceled and status code BQ is output to the customer. A PNCR stop

      research notice with the phrase “Exception with Cancellation” is output. The Processor
      will place a printed copy of the notice in the P/N package and will stop research.
      4.4.4.2. Manual Processing. If the CAGE, P/N and quantity in the customer cancellation
      transaction is not mechanically processed as indicated in the previous paragraph, a PNCR
      stop research notice with the phrase “Cancel P/N Request” is output. The Processor will
      use information in this notice to identify and then manager action the applicable “1C”
      controlled exception with status code CA. Input of status code CA will mechanically
      convert to a status code BQ based on the customer's request for cancellation. Receipt of
      DIC AC1 from the customer makes it unnecessary to send a status code CA cancellation
      letter to the customer explaining reason for cancellation.
         4.4.4.2.1. Customer cancellations received after requisitions are processed for
         purchase at a Site are costly. Validating P/N requisitions on a case-by-case basis
         could save the Air Force dollars; therefore, selective validation of P/N requirements
         on a case-by-case basis is authorized. In addition, the Processor will request that the
         base estimate future requirements at the time of validation.
         4.4.4.2.2. Quarterly, the Processor will review cancellations for adverse trends in
         customer cancellations (status code BQ) and highlight any abuse by specific bases
         with excessively high customer cancellation rates. These abuses will be identified to
         the appropriate MAJCOM by the Site for resolution action. The MAJCOM can then
         request the Site validate P/N requisitions.
4.5. PNCR Management.
  4.5.1. General. The PNCR database contains computerized entries with data elements tied to
  Site processing of P/N requisitions. D035A/B automatically screens requisition transactions
  with DIC A0B, A02, and A42 against the PNCR database; therefore, it is mandatory that the
  PNCR database be maintained with current information.
  4.5.2. Record Types. Within the PNCR database, there are six record types that will be
  maintained as new information about a Reference Number is identified. In some instances,
  this information is established and updated automatically. In cases where this does not
  happen automatically, Processors must manually maintain the PNCR database. There must
  be only one record type per Reference Number. Processors must first delete an existing
  record prior to establishing a different record type. Processors must perform periodic quality
  checks to ensure proper type record selection and to ensure that follow-up action is taken on
  those records requiring update or deletion/purging. All PNCR record types can be viewed
  and deleted using the PNRE screen. Table 4.8 identifies which type records can be updated
  via which screens.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                 227

                             to existing AF-managed NSN.
C         PNRA               Manually-established: Alternate Reference Number is acceptable
                             and applies to existing AF-managed NSN.
D         PNRB               Manually-established: Requisitioned Reference Number applies
                             to existing Non-AF-managed item.
E         PNRC               Manually-established: Establishing new NC or ND number.
F         PNRD               Manually-established: Apply constant reject.

      4.5.2.1. Type A - Initial Record. Type A records cannot be manually established but can
      be viewed using the PNRE screen. This type record is created by D035A mechanically
      upon receipt of a P/N requisition for which the reference number is unmatched in the
      PNCR database. This record indicates that a P/N requisition has been received and
      research is ongoing.
      4.5.2.2. Type B - AF Used NSN. Type B records are viewed and updated using the
      PNRA screen. Processors will manually establish a type B record in the PNCR database
      if research determines the requisitioned Reference Number resolves to a single, definite
      AF-managed NSN. Note: A type B record will not be manually built when research
      indicates that the AAC is Y; instead, the Processor must establish a type D record
      pending reactivation of the NSN.
      4.5.2.3. Type C - AF NSN -- Preferred Reference Number. Type C records are viewed
      and updated using the PNRA screen. Processors will manually establish a type C record
      when technical review determines the requisitioned Reference Number relates to a
      preferred Reference Number already assigned an AF-managed NSN. When the NSN is
      entered into the type C record, all subsequent P/N requisitions matching the type C record
      will be mechanically converted to the preferred NSN and process normally. Note: A
      type C record will not be manually built for NC numbers or ND numbers; instead, the
      Processor must establish either a type D or E record in these cases.
      4.5.2.4. Type D - Non-AF Used NSN. Type D records are viewed and updated using the
      PNRB screen. Processors will manually establish a type D record when technical review
      determines the requisitioned Reference Number resolves to an existing non-AF-managed
      item used NSN.
      4.5.2.5. Type E - NC or ND Number. Type E records are viewed and updated using the
      PNRC screen. Processors will manually establish a type E record when technical review
      determines the requisitioned Reference Number does not resolve to an existing NSN and
      one of the following type NSNs are to be established:

         4.5.2.5.1. An NC number on items for which recurring requirements.
         4.5.2.5.2. An ND number for which a one-time buy is to be initiated. Note: When a
         third demand occurs within 180 days, D035A will generate a notice stating: “Initiate
         Cataloging Action”. When this occurs, the non-logical spare becomes a potential
         logical spare and review for cataloging is mandatory. The notice will continue to be
         output every seven days from the date of last action of the stock number item record
         until the ND number is deleted or updated to an NSN or until the PNCR master has
         been file maintained with an NC number in the record.
      4.5.2.6. Type F - Constant Reject. Type F records are viewed and updated using the
      PNRD screen. Processors will manually establish a type F record when technical review
      determines all subsequent requisitions for a given Reference Number need to be rejected
      for the same reason.

                   WHOLESALE ASSET BALANCE MANAGEMENT

5.1. Overview.
   5.1.1. This chapter outlines the various materiel management processes IMs use to manage
   asset balances within D035A and focuses on: due-ins; receipts; drivers for change to variable
   balance records; asset visibility; asset-related interfaces with other data systems; and
   removing assets from the inventory.
5.2. Due-in Process.
   5.2.1. D035A maintains various records of assets due-in to depot storage as follows:
       5.2.1.1. Due-In from Procurement Assets. J041 maintains visibility of assets due-in from
       procurement. These due-in balances are overlaid to D035A on a weekly basis. A D035A
       AFMC Lead or Site Functional OPR user may update the due-in balances via DIC ZFF
       using the OVRE screen. See paragraph 13.15.1 for a sample format.
       5.2.1.2. Memo Due-In from Logistic Transfer. When management responsibility for a
       NSN transfers from an OS/A to AF, the LIM system provides a copy of all open due-in
       balances (referred to as a memo due-in balance) for the NSN to the GIM D035A. When
       the due-in assets are received by the LIM, ownership is immediately transferred to the
       GIM and DIC D4X or D6X is sent to the GIM D035A to close the memo due-in record.
       5.2.1.3. Due-In from Assembly, Disassembly, Conversion, Modification, Reclamation,
       Inspection. AF-owned and managed assets shipped to an organization for assembly,
       disassembly, conversion, modification, reclamation or inspections are not maintained by
       D035A as a due-in balance. At most these type assets are reported via CAV-AF as on-
       hand at a repair contractor facility.
   5.2.2. PMRD. J041 sends DIC DU_ to DSS for all procurement due-ins destined for depot
   storage. DSS uses this information to set up its own due-in records for matching against

5.3. Receipt Process.
   5.3.1. Common Receipt Processes. The following processes are performed for all types of
   receipt transactions received by D035A (see Chapter 8 for Controlled Exception/Notice
   processing details):
       5.3.1.1. If data in the From RI field is an SBSS RIC (i.e., begins with “D”), then the
       receipt transaction is passed to RAMP and no further processing occurs in D035A.
       5.3.1.2. If data in the From RI field is not an SBSS RIC, every receipt transaction
       processed by D035A is then edited for valid data. If the data in the edited field is valid
       the system continues to next edit; however, if the transaction does not pass these edits, it
       is suspended as a controlled exception for manual review and action. The common edits
       performed on all receipt transactions are found in Table 5.1.

               document number serial number
               field must contain four alphabetic
               and numeric characters.

O/P            Although O/P is not strictly an       N/A
               edited field, wholesale storage
               activities do not maintain
               accountable balances by purpose
               codes; therefore, all receipt
               transactions processed by D035A
               assume purpose code A (general
               issue).
Condition      Valid SCCs are maintained on a        1T controlled exception (Invalid
Code           database table that can be modified   Condition Code).

      5.3.1.3. If the item management data in D035A indicates that the receipt transaction was
      forwarded to the wrong D035A site (e.g., the storage site put the materiel under FHZ
      ownership, but FLZ is the correct owner of the materiel), a “1R” notice (Mgr Not Prime
      R/I) is created and a “DZC” transaction is sent to the storage activity to request a
      correction. The “DZC” transaction only corrects the storage activity’s records. The
      managing D035A has no visibility of the receipt transaction, so its asset balance is
      incorrect. The D035A Site Functional OPR deleting the “1R” notice must provide the
      receipt transaction data to the IM, who must manually enter the receipt transaction into
      D035A.
      5.3.1.4. If the item management data in D035A indicates the received materiel is
      obsolete (i.e., assigned constant reject code CJ, CK, CL or CV or phrase code N for the
      NSN), a “Receipt of Constant Reject Item” notice is created for the IM.
      5.3.1.5. If the item management data in D035A indicates the received materiel was
      posted under a NSN reserved for procurement action only (i.e., the materiel is to be
      delivered under a different NSN, so there is an assigned constant reject code of “JC” for
      the item), the receipt transaction is suspended as an “8P” controlled exception (Constant
      Reject Item).
      5.3.1.6. If the receipt transaction passes all edits without generating a controlled
      exception or notice, it is recorded to D035A transaction history and the variable balance
      record updated. Note: The receipt transaction is not visible on the D035A DODB screen
      until the following day.

   5.3.2. Procurement receipts processed by D035A are identified in Table 5.2
       5.3.2.1. Items from a procurement source are documented on one of the following forms:
       DD Form 250; DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document; DD Form
       1155, Order for Supplies or Services; and DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt
       Document.
       5.3.2.2. The D035A TARB menu option can be used to identify the rare situation where
       DIC D4_ is not received through the DAAS interface. See paragraph 5.6.5 for further
       details.
       5.3.2.3. The D035A RECA menu option may be used to process DIC D4_; however, this
       capability will only be used to post a receipt transaction that was processed successfully
       by a wholesale storage activity but was not received by D035A. The normal process is
       for the wholesale storage activity to send a copy of DIC D4_ to D035A through the
       DAAS. See paragraph 13.10.1 for sample format.

                                                       RAMP for in-transit processing.

   5.3.4. Asset Overlay. On a nightly basis, D035K uses its Retail Transaction History database
   to determine which O/P 9 account asset balances changed during the day. These transactions
   are used by D035A to replace existing asset balance records. There is no D035J feed created
   from these actions. If research indicates O/P 9 account asset balances have not been overlaid
   from D035K to D035A, DIC XBD, XBF or XBI can be input manually by any D035A
   Functional OPR to update asset balance records for a given NSN and condition. Note: This
   transaction will not process at collocated sites.
       5.3.4.1. DIC XBD changes SCC A, B, C, D, F and G on-hand balances. See paragraph
       13.9.4.1 for sample format for manual input of this transaction.
       5.3.4.2. DIC XBF changes SCC E, J, K, L, P, Q, and R at a non-collocated AF Depot. If
       DIC XBF indicates a change to a suspended SCC, a notice is created for the IM. See
       paragraph 13.9.4.2 for sample format for manual input of this transaction.
       5.3.4.3. DIC XBI changes SCC M, 1, 2 and 3 Due-In-From Overhaul balances. See
       paragraph 13.9.4.1 for sample format for manual input of this transaction.
5.4. Asset Visibility.
   5.4.1. Wholesale Asset Balance Locations and Reporting Systems.
       5.4.1.1. AF Depot Storage Facilities. The majority of wholesale assets controlled by
       D035A are stored at AFMC ICPs. These asset balances are, from a D035A perspective,
238                                                     AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


      maintained by D035K. Because D035K reports asset balances to D035J, D035K
      provides asset balance overlay transactions to D035A as detailed in paragraph 5.3.4.
      5.4.1.2. LRS Storage Facilities. Wholesale asset balances recorded on SBSS accounts
      are reported to RAMP whenever a balance or level changes for a specific stock number.
      On a nightly basis, RAMP determines if any of these asset balances exceed the base’s
      needs. SBSS asset balances in excess of base needs are then reported by RAMP to
      D035A for possible redistribution. The asset balance quantities on these overlay
      transactions replace the asset balance quantities maintained in D035A.
      5.4.1.3. Non-AF Depot Storage Facilities – DLA Managed. Wholesale asset balances
      stored at DLA/AF depot storage facilities are maintained and controlled by DSS. At each
      AF depot, DSS interfaces directly with D035K, which in turn, interfaces with D035A;
      however, at Non-AF depot, DLA-managed storage facilities, DSS interfaces directly with
      D035A via DAAS. D035A reports these asset balances to D035J, eliminating the need
      for an asset balance overlay process between DSS and D035A. These asset balances in
      D035A are only changed by processing a materiel receipt or issue transaction or
      inventory adjustment.
      5.4.1.4. Non-AF Depot Storage Facilities – Non-DLA Managed. Wholesale asset
      balances stored at these storage facilities (e.g., Letterkenny Army Depot) are maintained
      in service-unique data systems. These systems interface directly with D035A through
      DAAS. Because D035A reports these asset balances to D035J, there is no asset balance
      overlay process between D035A and these service-unique systems. These asset balances
      in D035A are only changed by processing a materiel receipt or issue transaction or
      inventory adjustment.
      5.4.1.5. DMISA Repair Facilities. Wholesale asset balances for assets being repaired
      under a DMISA are maintained in service-unique data systems. These systems interface
      directly with D035A through DAAS. Because D035A reports these asset balances to
      D035J, there is no asset balance overlay process between D035A and these service-
      unique systems. These asset balances in D035A are only changed by processing a
      materiel receipt or issue transaction or inventory adjustment.
      5.4.1.6. Commercial Repair Facilities. Wholesale asset balances for end items being
      repaired by a commercial contractor are maintained in either the G009 or the CAV-AF
      system. These systems also maintain visibility of assets provided to the contractor as
      GFM.
         5.4.1.6.1. End item asset balances maintained in G009 are not reported to D035A on
         a daily basis. At the beginning of every quarter, G009 provides asset balances to
         D035A for a feed to D200A. D035A does not provide visibility of assets maintained
         in G009 to support day-to-day business such as releasing assets to fill a BO.
         5.4.1.6.2. End item asset balances maintained in CAV-AF are reported to D035A on
         a daily basis. Because D035A reports these asset balances to D035J, there is no asset
         balance overlay process between D035A and CAV-AF. These asset balances in
         D035A are only changed by processing a materiel receipt or issue transaction or
         inventory adjustment. As part of an end-of-day process, the CAV system outputs
         400-character receipt (DIC D6_), issue (DIC D7_) and inventory adjustment (DIC

        Application Integrator (EAI) server interface. The EAI server converts these
        transactions into 80 character MILSTRAP transactions before passing the
        transactions on to the SCS web server. The SCS web server then routes each
        transaction to the appropriate D035A mainframe for processing. D035A uses these
        transactions to maintain its asset balance records and to feed D035J for financial
        reporting.
        5.4.1.6.3. GFM asset balances maintained in G009 and CAV-AF are not reported to
        D035A.
     5.4.1.7. Commercial Storage Facilities. Wholesale asset balances for assets stored at a
     commercial contractor facility are maintained in contractor-unique data systems. These
     systems may or may not interface directly with D035A through DAAS. If a contractor’s
     system does interface with D035A, then D035A is responsible for reporting these asset
     balances to D035J and there is no asset balance overlay process between D035A and the
     contractor’s system. These asset balances in D035A are only changed by processing a
     materiel receipt, issue or inventory adjustment transaction.
     5.4.1.8. Intransit Materiel. AF-owned and managed assets that have been confirmed as
     shipped, but not yet reported as received at the final destination are considered intransit.
     RAMP maintains visibility of intransit asset balances. These balances are not provided to
     D035A. See Chapter 6 for further details.
     5.4.1.9. On-Loan Assets. D035A is used to maintain visibility of loan assets, to include
     reporting a quantity rolled up by NSN to D035J. The on-loan balance maintained in
     D035A is based upon shipping assets from Purpose Code K and generating DIC D9B
     with management code L. If this balance changes, there is a feed to D035J.
  5.4.2. Online Screen and Page Views. Visibility of AF wholesale asset balances are
  captured via inquiring D035A, RAMP, WHSL and other select external data systems.
     5.4.2.1. D035A NSNC Screen. This screen displays the current asset balance records for
     a given NSN.
     5.4.2.2. D035A NSNE Screen. This screen provides the current D035A due-in balance
     record for a given NSN.
     5.4.2.3. RAMP and WHSL Pages. Copies of the D035A asset balance records are
     maintained on the SCS Midtier Oracle database by a near real-time interface process.
     The Wholesale Reports option provides the ability to create reports showing current
     wholesale asset balances.
     5.4.2.4. Web Inquiry Application. The Web Inquiry website can be used to query
     D035A, D035K and SBSS asset balances reported to RAMP. The data retrieved from
     D035A and D035K reflects the current asset balance. The data retrieved from RAMP
     may be more than 24 hours old due to the batch interface that exists between SBSS and
     RAMP.
     5.4.2.5. ES-S Application. Using the AF Portal, IMs can access the ES-S application to
     retrieve the current SBSS asset balance for a base DoDAAC/NSN combination. Review
240                                                    AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


      this data before manually entering manager action O1 or O2 into D035A to generate a
      RDO transaction to SBSS.
      5.4.2.6. CAV-AF Application. The CAV-AF application has a read-only web access
      capability for anyone with an assigned UserID and password. IMs with asset balances
      reported by CAV-AF obtain read-only access to CAV-AF.
      5.4.2.7. DSS. DSS has a read-only capability for anyone with an assigned UserID and
      password. IMs with asset balances in a DSS not interfaced with D035K obtain read-only
      access to DSS.
      5.4.2.8. Global Combat Support-AF (GCSS-AF). Copies of D035A and D035K asset
      balance records are provided to GCSS-AF. This data can be used to perform research
      (e.g., how specific asset balance records change over time).
  5.4.3. Maintaining Positive Inventory Control (PIC). PIC procedures are to be employed in
  handling assets categorized as Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel (NWRM). D035A also
  provides functionality for manually recording by serial number the location/condition/status
  of assets for any item assigned management code “M.”
      5.4.3.1. NWRM. AFI 20-110, Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel Management, directs
      IMs to account for and manage individual NWRM items by serial number. The
      composition of the official list of DoD and AF NWRM items is subject to change. The
      current list is available at the NWRM Enterprise Information Management (EIM). IMs
      will be notified through their normal chain of command as items they manage are added
      to/removed from the official NWRM list.
         5.4.3.1.1. Additions to NWRM List. For items identified as requiring NWRM PIC
         tracking, responsible parties will take actions detailed in Table 5.4.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                   241



Table 5.4. D035A/RAMP Actions for Items Added to NWRM List
Role              Action
D043 AFMC         Request PMO update D043 to reflect NWRM Indicator for items added to
Functional OPR    the NWM list.
D035A AFMC        1. Change the NWRM Indicator Code. Note: Although D035A receives
Lead Functional   this code as an overlay from D043, this update is not immediate. Manual
OPR               update is required to affect most timely change.
                  1.1. How: Input a “ZAB” transaction using the MIRB screen IAW
                  paragraph 13.17.6 to change the NWRM Indicator to “Y.”
                  1.2. Why: D035A uses this code as a prompt to apply the management code
                  of “M” within the D035 suite of subsystems to trigger specialized processing.
                  1.3. Where Visible in D035: This code appears on two D035A screens: the
                  NSNA screen has the “Crit Itm” field and the NSNB screen displays
                  “NWRM Item” in the lower right portion of the screen. The “Y” code is
                  maintained on the D035 mainframe SCD-ITEMS-REC table as the “MSN-
                  ESNTL-CD” (accessible via Data Query/Reporter ad hoc interrogation) and
                  on the SCS Midtier Item_View_001 table as the “Nwrmindicator”
                  (accessible via Discoverer ad hoc interrogation).
                  2. Change the management code.
                  2.1. How: Use the MIRB screen IAW paragraph 13.17.6 to change the
                  management code to “M.”
                  2.2. Why: D043 provides D035A an NWRM Indicator to identify items
                  require NWRM PIC tracking. D035A uses this code as a prompt to apply
                  management code M within the D035 suite of subsystems to trigger
                  specialized processing.
                  2.3. Where Visible in D035: This code appears on two D035A screens: the
                  NSNA screen has the “Crit Itm” field and the NSNB screen has the “Crit
                  Item Cd” field. Management code M is maintained on the D035 mainframe
                  “SCD-ITEMS-REC” table as the “CRIT-ITM-CD” (accessible via Data
                  Query/Reporter ad hoc interrogation) and on the SCS Midtier
                  “Item_View_001” table as the “Criticalitemcode” (accessible via Discoverer
                  ad hoc interrogation).
                  3. Check to make sure D035A has automatically applied MRC “L” to the
                  item IAW Chapter 11. If it has not, immediately contact your D035A Site
                  Functional OPR.
                  4. Remove pre-position code “A” from the item IAW Chapter 3.
                  4.1. How: Input DIC ZFB using the MIRC screen IAW paragraph 13.17.7
                  remove the pre-position code.
                  4.2. Why: If the pre-position code is “A,” the document priority is 01-08
 242                                               AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


Role        Action
            and the third position of the DIC is not “E” or “5,” D035A automatically sets
            the pre-position indicator to “T” on the BO. The “T” indicates the total
            quantity of the BO is pre-positioned for release.
            4.3. Where Visible in D035: This code appears on two D035A mainframe
            screens: the NSNA screen has the “Prep Cd” field and the BOAE screen has
            the “PC” field.
            5. Make sure the item reflects a LL code of other than “L” or “M.”
            5.1. How: Input DIC ZFB using the MIRC screen IAW paragraph 13.17.7
            to change the LL Code to something other than “L” or M.”
            5.2. Why: If the LL Code is “L” or “M,” responsibility for releasing BOs is
            delegated to EXPRESS (i.e., all BOs for an EXPRESS controlled NSN are
            considered pre-positioned).
            5.3. Where Visible in D035: This code appears on three D035A screens: the
            NSNA screen has the “LL Cd” field; the NSNB screen has the “Lean Log
            Code” field; and the BOAE screen has the” LL code” field.
RAMP AFMC   1. For items subject to RAMP system reporting, make sure RIMCS data is
Lead OPR    correctly file maintained.
            1.1. How: See paragraph 13.17.7.
            1.2. Why: This data must direct customers to return unserviceable NWRM
            items to specific secure storage locations using an appropriate priority.
            Note: The RAMP Site Functional OPR maintains a list of the DoDAACs
            tied to secure storage facilities to where NWRM assets are to be shipped.
            1.3. Where Visible in D035: RIMCS data appears in the SCS Midtier on the
            “Reparable Item Movement Control System” screen.
            2. For items subject to RAMP system reporting, apply “Command Peculiar”
            Item Characteristics to NWRM items. RAMP compares assets and levels at
            a given base to determine whether or not that activity is excess for a specified
            item. Application of a “No Compute Code” is insufficient to suppress all
            RAMP-generated RDOs to move serviceable and unserviceable excess assets
            from a base. For items to which neither a “No Compute Code” nor
            “Command Peculiar” Item Characteristics has been applied, RAMP advises
            D035A of excess quantities available for redistribution. See also Chapter 3
            for details regarding how D035A establishes a release sequence using
            total/partial excesses computed by RAMP.
            2.1. How: See paragraph 13.18.3. Note: Although the user reached the
            “Excess Management” page through input of a single DoDAAC and
            NSN/NIIN combination, selection of the “Command Peculiar” Item
            Characteristic causes RAMP to apply the same restriction to all DoDAACs
            for the specified NSN/NIIN.
            2.2. Why: The coding changes input by the D035A AFMC Lead Functional
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                  243


Role                Action
                    OPR are designed to fully restrict D035A system automatic movement of
                    assets; however should any of these coding changes inadvertently be
                    reversed or nullified, applying “Command Peculiar” Item Characteristic to an
                    NWRM item will at least prevent D035A from automatically attempting to
                    redistribute serviceable and unserviceable assets reported as base excess.
                    2.3. Where Visible in D035: The “Excess Management” screen in the SCS
                    Midtier displays whether RAMP is expected to compute base-level excess
                    for an entire DoDAAC, for an item or for an item/DoDAAC combination as
                    well as whether special Item Characteristics have been applied.
AF DSS              Work through either local D035K Retail Functional OPRs (ALC RIMs) or
Functional          through D035A Site Functional OPRs to request newly identified NWRM
Advocate            items be coded in DSS for serial number tracking.
635 SCOW            1. Request movement of assets from DLA storage facilities to an NWRM
                       storage facility.
IM                  1. 1. Consult with the ES to validate whether the applicable CIIC is correct.
                       If not, take cataloging action to change the CIIC value. 1. How: See
                       AFMCMAN 23-3, Chapter 11 for guidance in using the D043/D143C
                       Item Management Control System/Air Force Edit and Routing System
                       (IMCS/AFERS) to request updates to item information for feed back to
                       D035A.
                    1.2. Why: Various edits are applied within D035A and other automated data
                    processing systems throughout DoD based on CIIC assignment. Erroneous
                    assignment of a too restrictive CIIC may result in unnecessary manual
                    intervention. Erroneous assignment of an insufficiently restrictive CIIC may
                    result in failure to apply necessary manual intervention to prevent loss or
                    miss-shipment of materiel.
                    1.3. Where Visible in D035: This code appears on two D035A screens: the
                    NSNA screen has the “Scty Class” field and the NSNB screen has the “Sec
                    Cd” field.
                    2. Work controlled exceptions IAW Chapter 8.
                    3. Review D035A notices and take required action IAW Chapter 8.
                    4. Review RAMP Intransits IAW Chapter 6.
                    5. Provide valid ship-to location for delivery of new procurement via ISI or
                    ASI. Reference AFMCI 23-102.

             5.4.3.1.2. Deletes From NWRM List. For items identified as no longer requiring
             NWRM PIC tracking, responsible parties will take actions detailed in Table 5.5.
 244                                                    AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


Table 5.5. D035A/RAMP Actions for Items Deleted From NWRM List
Role              Action
D043 AFMC         Request PMO update D043 to delete NWRM Indicator for items deleted
Functional OPR    from the NWM list.
D035A AFMC        1. Change the NWRM Indicator Code. Note: Although D035A receives
Lead Functional   updates to this code as an overlay from D043, this update is not immediate.
OPR               Manual update is required to affect most timely change. Input DIC ZAB
                  using the MIRB screen IAW paragraph 13.17.6 to change the NWRM
                  Indicator to “N.”
                  2. Change the management code. Use the MIRB screen IAW paragraph
                  13.17.6 to change the management code to other than “M.”
RAMP AFMC         Although actions taken by the D035A AFMC Lead Functional OPR trigger
Lead OPR          automatic update of RAMP RIMCS ship –to sites, review for completion.
                  RIMCS must not direct shipment of non-NWRM items to PIC facilities. If
                  RIMCS currently shows a PIC facility ship-to DoDAAC, change the ship-to
                  site to the DoDAAC (for classified items). See paragraph 13.18.6.
AF DSS            Work through local D035K Retail OPRs or through local D035A Site
Functional        Functional OPR to request items removed from the NWRM list no longer be
Advocate          coded in DSS as requiring serial number tracking.
635 SCOW          Request movement of assets from an NWRM storage facility to DLA storage
                  facilities.
IM                1. Check the MRC. Unless other characteristics of the item cause D035A to
                  automatically apply MRC “L” (e.g., classified item), if the system did not
                  automatically downgrade the MRC, consider doing so manually (see
                  Chapter 11).
                  2. Consider applying an item pre-position code. Doing so will permit
                  D035A to code pertinent BOs to release for shipment against receipted assets
                  that would otherwise be sent to storage. Input DIC ZFB using the MIRC
                  screen IAW paragraph 13.17.7 to add the pre-position code.
                  3. Consider changing the LL code. By changing the LL code to “L” (basic
                  EXPRESS release) or “M” (Two-Level Maintenance EXPRESS release),
                  D035A delegates BO release sequencing to EXPRESS. Input DIC ZFB
                  using the MIRC screen IAW paragraph 13.17.7 to change the LL Code.
                  4. Consider removing the “Command Peculiar” Item Characteristic from
                  former NWRM items. RAMP compares assets and levels at a given base to
                  determine whether or not that activity is excess for a specified item. For
                  items to which neither a “No Compute Code” nor “Command Peculiar” Item
                  Characteristics has been applied, RAMP advises D035A of excess quantities
                  available for redistribution. See paragraph 13.18.3.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                   245


      5.4.3.2. Processing Classified Items. Although some policies/procedures addressed in
      this chapter are not unique to management of classified items, they have been included so
      that all pertinent guidance is captured in a single document.
            5.4.3.2.1. Classified items are characterized as materiel which requires protection in
            the interest of national security. Such items are governed by special security
            regulations and procedures related to authorization for use, proper protection during
            shipment, warehouse storage safeguards, conducting inventories, etc. CIIC A, B, C,
            D, E, F, G, H, K, L, S and T apply. D035A online screens display these values in
            fields labeled “Scty Class” and “Sec Cd”.
            5.4.3.2.2. For items identified as classified, the IM will take actions as shown in
            Table 5.6.

Table 5.6. IM Actions on Classified Items
Category         Action
Mandatory        1. Validate CIIC. Consult with the item ES to ensure that the most appropriate
                 CIIC has been assigned.
                 2. Apply MRC “L.” This is done automatically by D035A based on assignment
                 of a classified CIIC to an item as described in Chapter 11.
                 3. Validate RIMCS data. For RAMP-applicable items, the DoDAAC assigned
                 as any of the three ship-to sites must relate back to a secure storage facility.
                 This will most often be one of the following: a repair contractor facility; a
                 Centralized Repair Facility (CRF); or a depot storage facility. Contact the ALC
                 RAMP Site Functional OPR for current depot secure storage facility DoDAACs.
                 See Chapter 6 for further details.
                 4. Provide valid ship-to location for delivery of new procurement. This will
                 most often be a depot storage facility. Contact the center RAMP site functional
                 OPR for current depot secure storage facility DoDAACs. See AFMCI 23-102
                 for further details.

                 5.1. Contractor and FMS requisitions for classified items suspend as type “9A”
                 controlled exceptions (Manager Review Item) and/or “9L” controlled exceptions
                 (classified materiel request) awaiting wholesale IM review.
                 5.2. Those requisitions for classified items not suspended on type “9A” or “9L”
                 controlled exceptions will either be suspended on other type controlled
                 exceptions or forced on BO based on the item MRC “L.”
                 5.3. After the IM has verified whether the requisitioner is authorized to use the
                 ordered item (perhaps even going so far as to consult the applicable PMO, the

           23-101 and AFMAN 23-122; and DLM 4000.25-2, Chapter 7.
           10. Review and apply current procedures for logistics reassignment IAW
           AFMCI 23-105 and DLM 4000.25-2, Chapter 11.
           11. Review and apply current procedures for disposal. D035A must not be used
           to generate a disposal release order transaction for a classified item. See
           AFMCI 23-105.
Optional   1. Remove pre-position code “A” from the item. Input a “ZFB” transaction
           using the MIRC screen IAW paragraph 13.17.7 to remove the pre-position
           code.
           2. Apply LL code of other than “L” or “M.” Input a “ZFB” transaction using
           the MIRC screen IAW paragraph 13.17.7 to change the LL code to something
           other than “L” or “M.”
           3. Apply “Command Peculiar” Item Characteristics. See paragraph 13.18.3.
           Note: Although the user reached the “Excess Management” page through input
           of a single DoDAAC and NSN/NIIN combination, selection of the “Command
           Peculiar” Item Characteristic causes RAMP to apply the same restriction to all
           DoDAACs for the specified NSN/NIIN.
           4. Apply “No Compute” Code. RAMP compares assets and levels at a given
           base to determine whether or not that activity is excess for a specified item. For
           items without a “No Compute Code”, RAMP advises D035A of excess
           quantities available for redistribution. See also Chapter 3 for details regarding
           how D035A establishes a release sequence using total/partial excesses computed
           by RAMP.
           4.1. How: From any screen online in the SCS Midtier, click on the “Assets”
           button. Select “Excess Computation” from the drop-down menu. Type any AF
           base DoDAAC in the “DODAAC” field and type the classified item NIIN in the
           “NSN/NIIN” field. Click on the “Find” button. On the “Excess Management”
           page, within the box labeled “Excess Computation” and under the heading “Item
           Level”, click the radio button next to the phrase “Do not compute excesses for
           this item at any DoDAAC”. Click on the “Submit” button at the bottom of the
           page.
           4.2. Why: Use of MRC “L” and application of the coding changes are designed
           to fully restrict D035A system automatic movement of assets; however should
           any of these coding changes inadvertently be reversed or nullified, placing a “No
           Compute” code on a classified item will at least prevent D035A from
           automatically attempting to redistribute serviceable assets reported as base
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                 247

               4.3. Where Visible in D035: The “Excess Management” screen in the SCS
               Midtier displays whether or not RAMP is expected to compute base-level excess
               for an entire DoDAAC, for an item or for an item/DoDAAC combination.

      5.4.3.3. Assignment of management code M to an item (see paragraph 13.17.6)
      identifies to D035A the item requires focused management at the serial number level.
      When D035A receives a copy of an accountable transaction (DIC A6_, AR_, B7_, BL_,
      D4_, D6_, D7_, D8_, D9_, DAC) going to D035J for an item assigned management code
      M, it generates a “Serial Number Research Required” notice (see Table 8.4) formatted as
      DIC DSM for IM review and action. See Table 5.7 for a ‘DSM’ record layout. If serial
      number tracking is required, add or modify PIC database records IAW paragraph
      13.21.5 as follows:
           5.4.3.3.1. Identify which Stock Number/serial number/CAGE Code/part number
           combination applies to the asset associated with the transaction that resulted in
           creation of the notice.
           5.4.3.3.2. Using the NSNF screen,         interrogate   the   applicable   NSN/serial
           number/CAGE code combination.
              5.4.3.3.2.1. If a corresponding serial number row is not found (i.e., screen
              displays a message ‘No Records Found Based on User Input), add a new record in
              the PIC database.
              5.4.3.3.2.2. If a corresponding serial number row is displayed, modify an existing
              record in the PIC database.

Note: For OVRE screen sample format of DIC ZFF, see paragraph 13.15.1.
   5.5.2. On-hand Balance Records. D035A maintains variable balance records of on-hand
   assets after assets have been picked up to record: O/P Code, Storage RIC or DoDAAC, SCC,
   freeze date, inventory codes type/management (reflects inventory freeze code or inventory
   management code or percent excess code) and current balance.
      5.5.2.1. For wholesale materiel stored at an ICP which uses the D035K subsystem, the
      default O/P Code is 9; however, for materiel stored at a non-ICP storage activity, the
      default O/P Code is “A.” The only other valid O/P Code is “K,” which indicates materiel
      reserved for loan.
      5.5.2.2. Various processes can result in changes to data in the variable balance record.
      These processes include: Requisition Release for Shipment, Forced Shipments, Receipt
      Reversals, Inventory Adjustment Vouchers, Inter-Purpose/Inter-Condition Transfers, Re-
      identification of Stock and Loan. Table 5.9 identifies actions that effect on-hand balance
      records. Note: For further details regarding controlled exceptions created while
      processing transactions that effect on-hand balance records see Chapter 8.

Receipt Reversal   Data source                     1. Most receipt reversal transactions (i.e.,
                                                   the quantity field is a negative number) are
                                                   generated by the storage activity after a
                                                   manual input error was discovered with the
                                                   original receipt transaction.
                                                   2. These reversal transactions are normally
                                                   received by D035A through an interface
                                                   with the DAAS. However, if a system

                               action taken depends on whether the

                               2.1. If the reversal is a complete reversal,
                               then the original receipt transaction is

                 transactions are only recorded by D035A to transaction history. There is no

                 Note 3: A reversal transaction is normally indicated by a negative quantity
                 field, which is identified by the first character of the five-character quantity
                 field. A “}” is defined as a “-0.” A “J” is defined as a “–1”; “K” is defined
                 as a “–2”; “L” is defined as a “–3”; and so on through “R” for “-9.” For
                 example, a quantity field containing “}0001” on a “D6_” receipt transaction
                 will be interpreted as a receipt reversal of “1,” while a quantity field
                 containing “J0001” will be interpreted as “–10,001.”

                               code (if blank, the system defaults this field
                               to “A”) are all used to find the original
                               receipt transaction.
                               1. If D035A cannot find an original receipt
                               transaction in either database or any of these
                               fields on the reversal transaction do not
                               match the corresponding field on the
                               original transaction, a “4H” controlled
                               exception is created. All of these fields can
                               be corrected when clearing a “4H”
                               controlled exception.
                               Note 1: An exception to this rule is a
                               reversal transaction from a D035K site.
                               These types of inventory adjustment
                               transactions do not update asset balances
                               and are only recorded by D035A to
                               transaction history, so no “4H” controlled
                               exception is created in this situation.
                               Note 2: If the UI on the reversal transaction
                               does not equal the current UI for the
                               adjusted NSN, the reversal transaction is
                               suspended as a “5C” controlled exception.
                               Also, if the processing site is no longer the
                               managing site for the adjusted NSN, the
                               reversal transaction is suspended as a “5C”
                               controlled exception.
                               2. If the original transaction is found on the
                               suspended actions database, the action taken
                               depends on whether the reversal is a
                               complete reversal or a partial reversal of the
                               original transaction.
                               2.1. If the reversal is a complete reversal,
                               then the original transaction is deleted from
                               the Suspended Actions database. Both the
                               original and the reversal transactions are
                               written to the Suspended Actions History
                               database, where they are kept for 180 days.

                                                    balance.
                                                    3. If the current asset balance is greater than
                                                    the reversal quantity, the asset balance is
                                                    reduced by the reversal quantity.
                   Processing by DIC                If DIC D8_ or D9_ processed successfully,
                                                    it is recorded to transaction history.
                   Note: A reversal transaction is normally indicated by a negative quantity
                   field, which is identified by the first character of the five-character quantity
                   field. A “}” is defined as a “-0.” A “J” is defined as a “–1;” a “K” is
                   defined as a “–2;” an “L” is defined as a “–3;” and so on through “R” for “-
                   9.” For example, a quantity field containing “}0001” on DIC D6_ will be
                   interpreted as a receipt reversal of “1,” while a quantity field containing
                   “J0001” will be interpreted as “–10,001.”

                               formats to input DIC DAC via the RECC
                               screen.
                               1.1. The D035A RECC screen must not be
                               used for materiel stored at a D035K site;
                               rather, DIC DAC must be input into D035K
                               and then the nightly D035K asset overlay
                               process will update D035A asset balance
                               records.
                               1.2. DIC DAC input into D035A for a
                               D035K storage RIC (i.e., FGB, FHB or
                               FLB) do not update D035A balance records;
                               they are only recorded to history.
                               2. When the DIC DAC transaction
                               processes, D035A updates its accountable
                               balance records and records the transaction
                               to a Daily Transaction History record. The

                               2.1. If DIC DAC moved materiel to SCC A
                               and the materiel is not stored at an ICP,
                               D035A processes a release BO transaction.
                               This will automatically release this materiel
                               to fill any eligible BOs; therefore, if a user
                               inputs DIC DAC and a review of the results
                               on the D035A NSNC screen does not reflect
                               this increase in SCC A balance records, the
                               materiel was used to support a BO.
                               2.2. The D035A DODF screen can be used
                               to search for issue (DIC D7_) transactions

                                          3.1. If the IM wishes to have materiel
                                          moved between SCCs (for example, from
                                          SCC K to SCC F so that the materiel may be
                                          shipped to disposal), the storage/repair site
                                          must be contacted to have this action take
                                          place.
                                          3.2. When the transfer is completed, the
                                          storage/repair site will transmit DIC DAC
                                          (or a combination of an IAV Increase

                 Inter-Purpose Transfer   Wholesale storage activities do not maintain
                                          accountable balances by O/P Codes;
                                          therefore, all inter-purpose transfer actions
                                          must be input into D035A manually.
                                          1. Wholesale materiel stored at the
                                          managing or co-located ICP may be
                                          transferred between O/P Codes 9 and K, but
                                          wholesale materiel stored at one of the other
                                          two ICPs must remain in O/P Code 9. For
                                          example, items managed at Hill depot may
                                          be stored in O/P K at Hill depot; but Hill-
                                          managed items cannot be stored in O/P
                                          Code K at Tinker or Robins depots.
                                          1.1. Materiel stored at a non-AF ICP
                                          storage RIC (e.g., AN5, BA4, P64 and
                                          SDA) can be transferred between O/P Codes
                                          A and K.
                                          1.2. Base excess assets are those reported
                                          under a storage DoDAAC (e.g., FB4800)

                               instead of storage RIC and cannot be
                               transferred out of O/P Code A.
                               1.3. Whenever a contractor requisition is
                               received, D035A searches for assets in O/P
                               Code K for the ordered NSN. If an
                               accountable balance record is found with
                               O/P Code K, the requisition is suspended for
                               manual release by the LCO; so, assets must
                               not be left in O/P Code K unless receipt of
                               an AF contractor loan requisition is
                               expected.
                               1.4. For materiel required for special
                               projects, it is inappropriate to use O/P Code
                               K to reserve assets. Materiel for special
                               projects can be placed in an aggregation
                               account within SSSC. See Volume 5,
                               Chapter 5 for an explanation of SSSC
                               aggregation account processes.
                               2. When a DIC DAD transaction processes,
                               D035A updates its accountable balance
                               records and records the transaction to a
                               Daily Transaction History record. The
                               following day, transactions recorded to this
                               history record can be viewed through the
                               DODB screen by entering the appropriate
                               document number.
                               2.1. If the materiel is stored at the co-
                               located D035K, D035A also updates the
                               D035K accountable balance record and
                               records the DIC DAD transaction to a Retail
                               Transaction History record. If the materiel
                               is moved to O/P Code K, the D035A
                               accountable balance record’s storage RIC
                               field will contain the RIC of the managing
                               D035A instead of the D035K RIC (e.g.,
                               FLZ not FLB). See paragraph 13.8.3 for a
                               sample format to input a “DAD” transaction
                               via the AUXB screen.
                               2.2. DIC DAD will be processed by D035J
                               the following day and can then be viewed
                               through the D035A DODF screen by

                                  3. When D035A fills a local D035K retail

                                  O/P code 9 at the co-located D035K storage
                                  site (e.g., FGB), a “ship-to-self” action takes
                                  place. This is recorded as DIC DAD in
                                  D035K and causes the materiel to move
                                  from O/P code 9 to A. Once the materiel is
                                  in O/P code A, it belongs to the D035K and
                                  is no longer visible through the D035A

                                  Note: The financial transactions associated
                                  with this “DAD” transaction are visible
                                  through the D035A DODF screen as an IAV
                                  increase (DIC D8D) transaction and an IAV
                                  decrease (DIC D9D) transaction.
Re-identification   N/A           The vast majority of re-identification of
of Stock                          stock actions are initiated by a storage or
                                  repair activity, which transmits an IAV
                                  increase transaction (DIC D8J) and an IAV
                                  decrease transaction (DIC D9J) to D035A to
                                  keep the accountable balance records of
                                  both systems in agreement.
                                  Although D035A does provide the
                                  capability to manually process re-
                                  identification of stock actions, this
                                  capability will only be used to process
                                  transactions that were processed
                                  successfully by the wholesale storage

   5.5.3. Intransit Balance Records.
       5.5.3.1. Intransits in D035A. The Intransit data maintained in D035A is based upon
       processing manager actions O2 and V3, DICs D6_ and FTM. There is not a feed from
       RAMP to maintain this data and there is not a D035J feed created based on the D035A
       Intransit quantity.
          5.5.3.1.1. Whenever action code O2 or V3 is used to relocate assets, the quantity
          requested for shipment is added to the intransit quantity for the given NSN.
             5.5.3.1.1.1. If a shipment denial transaction is received, the denied quantity is
             subtracted from the intransit quantity for the given NSN.
             5.5.3.1.1.2. When DIC D6K is received, the received quantity is subtracted from
             the intransit quantity for the given NSN.
          5.5.3.1.2. When DIC FTM is received, the quantity shipped is added to the intransit
          quantity for the given NSN. When DIC D6_ is received, the received quantity is
          subtracted from the intransit quantity for the given NSN.
          5.5.3.1.3. A D035A Site Functional OPR user, through the use of the IAVA and
          IAVB screens, can modify the D035A Intransit quantity. These screens do not update
          RAMP data.
             5.5.3.1.3.1. Using the IAVA screen, DIC D8B with a management code T can be
             processed to increase the intransit quantity for a given NSN.
             5.5.3.1.3.2. Using the IAVB screen, DIC D9B with a management code T can be
             processed to decrease the intransit quantity for a given NSN.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                              269


             5.5.3.1.3.3. The TXRA and TXRB screens will not be used to process DIC
             D8B/T or D9B/T reversal transaction. Instead, to reverse DIC D8B, input DIC
             D9B and, to reverse DIC D9B, input DIC D8B transaction.
      5.5.3.2. These Intransits are visible on the NSNE screen.
5.6. Asset-Related Interfaces with Other Data Systems.
   5.6.1. Feed to D035J. D035A provides D035J both accountable transactions and other
   transactions affecting calculation of item Moving Average Cost (MAC).
      5.6.1.1. Accountable Transactions. D035A is the system responsible for reporting
      accountable transactions to D035J when no D035K system is involved (i.e., Storage at
      non-AF Depots, storage reported by CAV-AF, D035A RDOs assets from SBSS sites).
      When D035K is involved (i.e., at an AF Depot), D035K is the system responsible for
      reporting accountable transactions to D035J.         Table 5.10 depicts only those
      circumstances when D035A is the system responsible for reporting to D035J. Information
      in the “Description” column identifies circumstances for D035A to generate transactions
      to D035J as reflected in the “DIC”, “Type Transaction” and “Sub-category” columns.
      Note: D035A sends no accountable transactions to D035J for ERRC “S” and “U” items.

      5.6.5.3. DSS/D035A. The DSS/D035A reconciliation process determines out of balance
      quantities and provides an automated way to reconcile transactions between D035A and
      each non-D035K DSS storage facility. The following is a general overview of the asset
      balance reconciliation process as it relates to D035A.
         5.6.5.3.1. The reconciliation process detailed here applies only to AF-owned assets
         stored at non-D035K DSS storage facilities and includes all SCCs. Refer to Table
         5.12 for a list of DSS storage facilities supported in the process. This process does not
         apply to the following assets:
             5.6.5.3.1.1. AF-owned assets stored at non-D035K repair activities under a
             DMISA.
             5.6.5.3.1.2. AF-owned assets stored at non-D035K, non-DSS storage locations.
             5.6.5.3.1.3. AF-owned assets that are in-transit between storage locations.

         5.6.5.3.2. The DSS/D035A asset balance reconciliation is a two-step process:
             5.6.5.3.2.1. The Daily Transaction Match Process. Transactions from both
             D035A and DSS are reconciled each day. The Infloat Database and Infloat
             History Database are used in this process.
                5.6.5.3.2.1.1. The Infloat Database stores and reconciles D035A and DSS
                accountable transactions. Transactions written to this database remain here
                for 90 days and can be viewed via the TARB screen.
                  5.6.5.3.2.1.1.1. At the end of each day, DSS generates Transaction History
                  Transmittal ‘DZK’ transactions and forwards them to D035A. The ‘DZK’
                  reports DSS transaction history to the asset owner. These transactions are
                  written to the Infloat Database.
                  5.6.5.3.2.1.1.2. D035A transactions are written to the Infloat Database in
                  real-time when they have been successfully processed. If a transaction
                  creates an exception, it is not written to the Infloat Database until the
                  exception has been successfully cleared.

          5.6.5.3.2.1.1.3. As DSS transactions are written to the Infloat Database, the
          transaction matching process automatically reconciles them to D035A
          transactions. Transactions are “reconciled” if there is a match on all of the
          following fields: NIIN, UI, Quantity, SCC, RIC, RI Owner, Submitting
          RIC, document number and document number Suffix. For a complete list of
          the system checks used for reconciling DSS and D035A transactions, refer
          to AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 4.
              5.6.5.3.2.1.1.3.1. Transactions that are automatically reconciled by the
              system are assigned a “cross-reference” number and a Process Code of
              ‘1’. The same cross-reference number is assigned to both the DSS and
              D035A transaction and is used to link the two transactions together.
              Process Code ‘1’ identifies reconciliations that were “system processed”.
              For a complete list of system assigned process codes refer to
              AFMCMAN 23-5, Volume 4.
              5.6.5.3.2.1.1.3.2. Un-reconciled transactions are not assigned a process
              code. These transactions can be viewed and manually reconciled via the
              “TARB” Infloat Reconciliation screen as detailed in Table 5.14.
         5.6.5.3.2.1.2. The Infloat History Database is an archive of records from the
         Infloat Database that are greater than 90 days old. The data is stored in this
         table for two years and is only accessible via Data Query.
      5.6.5.3.2.2. The Monthly Asset Balance Reconciliation Process is detailed
      sequentially in Table 5.13.

Action       System/Role Procedure
Initial      SCS PMO      Load D035A AFMC Lead Functional OPR UserIDs to the SCD-
Manual       POC          INTFAC1-REC to provide access to the TARF, TARG and TARH
Processing                screens. Once done, this step is not required for subsequent
                          reconciliations unless there has been a change in personnel
                          requiring update access to the noted screens.
             D035A        1. Use the TARF screen to maintain on the D035A SCD-
             AFMC Lead    RECNAUTH-REC table a list of DSS sites authorized to perform
             Functional   asset balance reconciliation (see Table 5.12) for add, change and
             OPR          delete actions. See Table 5.14.
                          2. Use the TARG screen to maintain the package level asset
                          balance reconciliation criteria. See Table 5.14.
                          3. Use the TARH screen to maintain the inventory adjustment
                          transaction reconciliation criteria. See Table 5.14.
Initial      DSS and      When: On the Monday after the third Sunday of each month
System       D035A        (except when Monday is a holiday, in which case processing is on
Processing                Tuesday).
                          What: Each DSS storage facility transmits Location Reconciliation
                          Request (‘DZH’) transactions via SCS Midtier to D035A.
                          How: A ‘DZH’ transaction reports an asset balance by NSN, SCC,
                          RI Owner, DSS storage RIC and current date. D035A compares
                          the data in these ‘DZH’ transactions to data in the SCD-TASSET-
                          REC:
                          1. If the asset balance on the ‘DZH’ transaction matches the
                          D035A asset balance, no additional action is taken.
                          2. If there is a mismatch, D035A determines the out-of-balance
                          quantity and reviews the Infloat Database for any “un-reconciled”
                          transaction(s) that may have caused the out-of-balance condition.
                          1.1. If the system finds “un-reconciled” transaction(s) that explains
                          why the out-of-balance condition has occurred, the proposed IAV
                          transaction which would have been proposed to adjust the D035A
                          asset record is instead written to the Averted Adjustment Database.
                          These averted adjustments can be used for analysis to determine
                          whether to increase the number of days of Infloat transactions that
                          will be automatically reviewed during the monthly reconciliation.
                          Note: Averted Adjustment data is available only on reports going
                          back five iterations and via request from an AFMC Lead Functional
                          OPR.

Action    System/Role Procedure
                        1.2. If the system finds no “un-reconciled” transactions that can
                        explain why the out-of-balance condition has occurred, D035A
                        creates DIC D8B D9B and writes it to the Proposed Reconciliation
                        Adjustments Database. Each transaction is assigned a unique
                        document number with management code P. Note: These
                        transactions can be viewed and manually reconciled via the
                        “TARE” Proposed Reconciliation Adjustments screen. See Table
                        5.14.

Manual     AFMC Lead    reconciliation for each DSS reporting site found in Table 5.12 has
Processing Functional   run.
           OPR          1.1. If not, interrogate the DSS RICs via the TARF screen to
                        identify whether the storage locations are authorized to participate
                        in the reconciliation process.
                        1.1.1. If they are not authorized, no further action is required.
                        1.1.2. If they are authorized to participate, run Data Query titled
                        “ASSET-RECON1” to verify whether D035A shows any balances
                        at that storage location.
                        1.1.2.1. If no such balances exist, no further action is required.
                        1.1.2.2. If D035A shows balances at that location, contact the SCS
                        PMO to see if there was a problem with execution of the systemic
                        inventory reconciliation process (e.g., whether D035A received
                        DIC DZH from those DSS RICs).
                        1.1.2.2.1. If there was a system problem, request SCS PMO
                        resolve the problem and reprocess for affected reporting locations.
                        1.1.2.2.2. If there was no system problem but D035A did not
                        receive DIC DZH for storage locations authorized to participate in
                        the monthly reconciliation process, contact HQ DDC/J6 to verify if
                        transactions were sent and to agree upon further action required
                        (e.g., re-transmittal of the transactions or re-processing within DSS
                        to generate a new file of “DZH” transactions).
                        1.2. If so, take the following sequential actions:
                        1.2.1. Run Data Query titled “ASSET-RECON2” to create site-
                        specific Proposed Adjustment reports that identify mismatches
                        requiring review.
                        1.2.2. Via E-mail, advise D035A Site Functional OPRs to begin
                        review of and take action as required to prevent or cause generation
                        of proposed IAV transactions. Attach a copy of the Proposed
                        Adjustments report.
                        2. Review “DZG” transactions identified via the TARD screen

                      using the Transaction Date of the monthly reconciliation run (i.e.,
                      use the date of the third Sunday of the month regardless whether
                      Monday is a holiday).
                      2.1. Request SCS PMO POC to generate DIC DZC for balances
                      reported via DIC DZH to one AF ICP but which are for items
                      managed by another AF ICP.

                      managed by an OS/A.
                      2.3. For those mismatches on OS/A-owned assets erroneously
                      reported to AF but which cannot be resolved via submittal of DIC
                      DZC, work through Interservice Functional OPR to advise Other
                      Service owners that their assets are being reported as AF-owned in
                      error.
                      2.4. Task D035A Site Functional OPRs with working remaining
                      “DZG” transactions (e.g., those for which CAS is the stock control
                      system and the IM needs to review for proposed duplicate or under-
                      reporting in CAS).
                      2.4.1. Run Data Query titled “ASSET-RECON3” to create site-
                      specific “DZG” Rejects report that identify mismatches requiring
                      review.

       number with a non-loan balance. These transactions are passed to D035J, which
       performs a reconciliation against its asset balance records.
       5.6.5.5. DMISA/D035A. There currently is no automated asset reconciliation process
       between D035A and a DMISA repair activity.

       transactions with end-of-day balances for all items with assets for which D035A requires
       CAV reporting (e.g., end items undergoing repair). D035A compares the asset balances
       in these transactions to the corresponding variable balance records in the SCD-ITEMS-
       REC.

          will create proposed IAV transactions and suspend them on type “7C” controlled
          exceptions: ‘D8M’ (increase because the quantity in CAV is greater than shown in
          D035A) or ‘D9M’ (decrease because the quantity in CAV is less than shown in

                              the disposal requisition record. The system
                              closes disposal requisition records when no
                              open quantity remains. Closed disposal

            materiel (SCC H) for which the
            repair activity is not authorized to
            take disposal action.
            2. To successfully use the NEW

            there must be an Items Record
            and an accountable balance record

              REPORTABLE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROCESS (RAMP)

Section 6A—-General.

6.1. Purpose. This chapter provides the concepts and procedures required for understanding
and operating the D035C RAMP subsystem. RAMP performs multiple functions for reportable
AF-managed items (see Table 6.1):
   6.1.1. RAMP maintains visibility of AF-owned and managed assets and/or levels for base
   retail, depot retail and depot wholesale reporting locations. This does not include those items
   stored at non-AF depot storage sites (e.g., RICs BY6 and AN5). Visibility is provided by
   NSN and reporting location DoDAAC. See paragraphs 6.6 and 6.7 for further details.
   6.1.2. RAMP computes base retail serviceable excess. The system uses asset and levels
   information reported by SBSS and D035K to compute serviceable excess that it reports to
   D035A nightly for potential redistribution. See paragraph 6.8 for further details.
   6.1.3. RAMP accumulates Stock Balance and Consumption Reporting (SB&CR) data for the
   D200A requirements determination system. RAMP provides D200A the following for
   recoverable and/or consumable items: summation of stock balances and consumption data;
   accountable transaction data; usage data; retail activity repair cycle time; retail activity
   processing time; unserviceable intransit time; and retail activity order and ship time. See
   paragraph 6.12 for further details.
   6.1.4. RAMP provides Reparable Item Movement Control System (RIMCS) information to
   base and depot retail activities. RAMP RIMCS data identifies to base and depot retail
   customers what shipment priority to use and where to ship unserviceable assets. See Section
   6C for further details. Note: Most RAMP records are created or actioned based on inputs
   received by interfacing data systems. Exceptions that drive input of data to the system
   manually include: RIMCS data for non-CSWS managed items; infrequent manual update of
   assets, levels and intransits when interfacing data is unavailable or inaccurate; and
   assignment of item characteristics that influence the excess computation process.

6.2. Items Record Database Maintenance for RAMP.
   6.2.1. Stock Number data received from D043 add or change the D035A items database on a
   daily basis (see Chapter 11). Changes to D035A items database records are synchronized to
   the Midtier items database during a nightly process. To change items records used by RAMP
   on the Midtier, it is necessary to initiate the file maintenance action in the controlling system
   (i.e., D035A or D043).
   6.2.2. RAMP identifies itself as a user of an NSN when it receives a transaction containing
   an NSN for which it previously has not been recorded as a user. RAMP sends a transaction
   with DIC ‘ZAF’ and an ‘A’ (add) action code to direct D035A to add RAMP as a user of an
   item. D035A processes the establishment request from RAMP and sets the RAMP user code
   to a ”1” which is displayed on the NSND, screen w or the NSNB inquiry.
   6.2.3. RAMP requests deletion as a user of an NSN when: there are neither assets nor levels
   reporting for that item; or when an item goes inactive (i.e., RIC is changed to ‘JCD’). RAMP
   sends a transaction with DIC ‘ZAF’ and a ‘D’ (delete) action code to direct D035A to delete
   RAMP as a user of an item. D035A processes the deletion request from RAMP and sets the
   RAMP user code on the SCD-ITEMS-REC to a space which is displayed on the NSND,
   screen 2 or the NSNB inquiry. Note: D035A will not delete an items record as long as
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                       305


   RAMP is recorded as a user. NSNs cannot be deleted by file maintenance action via the user
   interface.
   6.2.4. RAMP data is affected by item management logistics transfers, I&SG establishments,
   master record creations and changes to various types of item management data.
      6.2.4.1. Item transfers are processed as follows:
          6.2.4.1.1. When a Stock List Change (SLC) action results in transfer of item
          management responsibility, only RIMCS Control Code ‘T’ items will automatically
          have the Source of Repair (SOR) ship-to Site DoDAAC changed to the new SOS
          RIC.
          6.2.4.1.2. If the item transfers out of AF item management (e.g., to DLA or an
          OS/A), RAMP will be deleted as a user of the NSN and all associated records will be
          deleted.
      6.2.4.2. When a stock list change action results in an ERRC code change from “N,” “P,”
      or “T” to another ERRC and the NSN does not contain either a Critical Item code ‘C’ or
      an Intensive management code ‘M,’ RAMP will delete the retail activity assets and levels
      data.
      6.2.4.3. Changes to UI are processed as follows:
          6.2.4.3.1. Asset and levels records are multiplied by the conversion factor (see DoD
          4100.39-M, Volume 10, Table 79). If the result is less than one, the quantity will be
          adjusted up to one, but if the result is greater than one, the quantity will be rounded to
          the nearest whole number.
          6.2.4.3.2. All intransit quantities are multiplied by the conversion factor. If the result
          is less than one, the quantity will be adjusted up to one, but if the result is greater than
          one, the quantity will be adjusted to the nearest whole number. When the UI cannot
          be converted mechanically, the intransit record will be deleted. A No Compute code
          of ‘N’ will be set for that combination retail activity/NSN and the intransit and RDO
          balance fields will be reduced to zero.
6.3. DoDAAC/RI Validation.
   6.3.1. The D035A DoDAAC/RI Cross Reference Table (SCD-TAB24-REC) serves as
   RAMP’s validation source for retail activity RICs and can only be updated by those with
   D035A AFMC Lead Functional OPR level access.
   6.3.2. RAMP uses D035T’s DoDAAC record as its validation source for other DoDAACs.
   6.3.3. In processing DoDAAC deletions, RAMP deletes all asset and level records for the
   affected DoDAAC.

Section 6B—-Assets, Levels and Orders.

6.4. Overview.
   6.4.1. RAMP maintains retail activity stock levels, asset balances, intransit balances, due-in
   and due-out quantities plus other stock control data by NSN and location (i.e., DoDAAC). It
   also maintains wholesale activity asset balances by NSN and location. This section describes
 306                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


   how RAMP receives, processes and displays assets and levels information provided from
   SBSS, D035A and D035K. The objectives of the assets and levels segment of RAMP are to
   provide IMs with current asset and level information necessary for effective item
   management. RAMP also provides interfacing systems with current asset and levels
   information.
   6.4.2. RAMP maintains asset and levels visibility for the following type items as shown in
   Table 6.1.
6.5. In-Bound Transaction Process.
   6.5.1. RAMP receives inbound transactions from D035A, D035K and SBSS.
       6.5.1.1. SBSS transmits transactions that report asset balances and levels, Daily Demand
       Rates (DDR) and Percentages of Base Repair (PBR) when changes occur in the asset or
       level position on AFMC-managed items as defined in Table 6.1. These transactions are
       triggered by base activity during the day and are generated from an end-of-day work unit
       process. The transactions are then overlaid into RAMP, replacing any previously
       reported data. When SBSS sends a transaction for an NSN with all data fields containing
       zeroes, RAMP will delete the record for that DoDAAC and NIIN combination.
       6.5.1.2. D035K reports depot retail asset data to RAMP via M024B and D035A. The
       transactions are triggered by depot retail activity during the day and are generated from
       an end-of-day work unit process. The transactions are then overlaid into RAMP,
       replacing any previously reported data.
       6.5.1.3. D035K also reports daily consumption data (transactions with DIC ‘XBT’) for
       ERRC codes “T” using the same data reporting method as for asset reporting. RAMP
       accumulates this consumption data by NIIN and DoDAAC. At the end of each quarter,
       RAMP summarizes the data by NIIN and DoDAAC and transmits a file to the managing
       D035A site. D035A combines data from RAMP with data from other systems to produce
       a file of asset and usage data that is transmitted to D200A.
   6.5.2. Timing of Daily Process.
       6.5.2.1. SBSS to RAMP. SBSS provides asset and levels data (D28 Reporting) via a
       daily batch process. Unfortunately, this process is not actually always done on a daily
       basis at every SBSS location and it may take as long as 2-3 days to receive these D28
       transactions creating a potential disconnect between reported data and what is captured in
       RAMP.
       6.5.2.2. D035K to RAMP. D035K executes a daily batch process (Work Unit
       ZKJKD050) that generates at each site and is usually available to RAMP by the
       following day. D035K Program ZKBI1241 processes retail transaction history data from
       the previous day to generate RAMP transactions.
       6.5.2.3. D035A/B transmits transactions to RAMP as they occur.
   6.5.3. Transaction Types. Table 6.2 and Table 6.3 display the various transaction types that
   the RAMP in-bound process recognizes.

   6.5.4. RAMP In-Bound Edits. In-bound transactions are subject to various edits shown in
   Table 6.4. RAMP rejects transactions back to the retail customer via a transaction with DIC
   ‘7MS’ and a reject AAC as shown in Table 6.5 under the following circumstances:
   Transaction DoDAAC/UI/NSN not on master; transaction NSN not on master FSC/MMC
   Tables; FSC/MMC Table indicates PRIME for transaction FSC/MMC; transaction NSN File
   Maintenance code is ‘D’, ‘U’ or ‘N’.

Table 6.4. RAMP Edits for Inbound Transactions
Data Element Edit      Action
Validate NIIN          RAMP first validates the NIIN for all transactions. If RAMP receives
                       a transaction with a NIIN that is not found in the SCS item database,
                       the transaction fails the edit and is rejected.
Check SOS              1. When SBSS reports an asset balance and the SOS is ‘JCD’ (i.e., an
                       obsolete/inactive item), a transaction with DIC ‘7MS’ is returned to
                       SBSS with a reject advice code indicating SOS is invalid.
                       2. The DICs for transactions subject to this edit include the following:
                       ‘7LF’, ‘9Q_’, ‘BDR’, ‘D4_’, ‘D7_’, ‘D8_’, ‘D9_’, ‘DAC’, ‘DZ_’ and
                       ‘XB_’.
Convert RI to          1. RAMP converts the reporting SBSS RIC to a corresponding
DoDAAC                 DoDAAC.
                       2. The DICs for transactions subject to this edit include the following:
                       ‘7LF’, ‘9Q_’, ‘DAC’, ‘DZF’, ‘D4_’, ‘D7_’, ‘D8_’ and ‘D9_’.
Check UI               1. The UI in the transaction must equal the UI on the SCS Items
                       database or the UI and quantity in the transaction must be convertible
                       to the Items database UI.
                       2. The DICs for transactions subject to this edit include the following:
                       ‘7LF’, ‘9Q_’, ‘D4_’, ‘D7_’, ‘D8_’, ‘D9_’, ‘DAC’ and ‘XB_’.
Check Processing       1. For transactions with DICs ‘7LF’, ‘9Q_’, ‘DZF’ and ‘XB_’, the
Effective Date         process date from the transaction cannot be greater than 184 days in
                       the future and the process date from the transaction minus the system
                       date cannot be greater than seven days.
                       2. For transactions with DICs ‘D4_’, ‘D7_’, ‘D8_’, ‘D9_’, ‘DAC’ and
                       ‘BDR’, the process date cannot be greater than 90 days in the future
                       and the process date from the transaction minus the system date cannot
                       be greater than zero.
Validate DoDAAC        1. Transactions received from D035K must contain a valid D035K
                       DoDAAC of FB2029, FB2039 or FB2065.2. The DICs for
                       transactions subject to this edit include the following: XBB, XBL and
                       XBT.
Check Priority Code    The transaction priority designator must be “03” or “13” for a
                       transaction with DIC ‘BDR;’ otherwise, it is ignored.
Check Effective Date   The effective date in all transactions that update RAMP “Materiel
                       Assets” or “Materiel Asset Statistics” tables is checked against the “as
                       of” date for that type transaction on the table. The balance is not
                       updated if the ‘as of date’ on the table is greater than the effective date
                       on the transaction.

6.6. Assets. RAMP provides visibility of base retail, depot retail and depot wholesale asset
balances. Asset balance data is composed of the asset type, quantity and the date of last update
for each asset balance. Table 6.6 details under what circumstances a user can view and/or
manually affect base and depot asset balances.

Table 6.6. User Ability to View/Update/Establish Base & Depot Balances Manually
Source              Status               View?         Update?      Establish?
Base Retail         Existing balance     Yes           Yes          N/A
Base Retail         New balance          N/A           N/A          Yes

Depot Wholesale     New balance          N/A           N/A          No

   6.6.1. If data within RAMP is incorrect, it is best to request that the data be corrected within
   and regenerated from the source system rather than to make manual changes directly in
   RAMP. Data must only be changed manually within RAMP as a last resort because any
   creation or updating of asset balances by the user is temporary; the next asset balance overlay
   received from the reporting DoDAAC will replace whatever the user changed.

   6.6.2. Base Retail Assets. Users can update existing base retail asset balance quantities with
   the exception of those with the following asset types: DIFM Awaiting Parts, Total
   Inaccessible, Limited Inaccessible and Inaccessible Maintenance. See paragraph 13.11 for
   sample formats to view, change and establish base retail asset balances.
   6.6.3. Depot Retail and Depot Wholesale Assets. Although there is little practical value in
   doing so, users can update unserviceable depot wholesale asset balance quantities (i.e., the
   managing site DoDAAC begins with ‘FD’). See paragraph 13.12. Users cannot update
   other type depot wholesale asset balance quantities (e.g., serviceable). Users cannot update
   depot retail asset balance quantities (i.e., the managing site DoDAAC is ‘FB2029’, ‘FB2039’
   or ‘FB2065’). Users cannot establish new depot retail/wholesale asset balance records.
6.7. Levels.
   6.7.1. Daily, D035K and SBSS provide RAMP retail stock level data for applicable
   DoDAAC and NSN/NIIN combinations. Table 6.7 shows which levels are affected by
   specific types of transactions. The “Levels” page provides the capability to query levels for a
   specific DoDAAC and NSN/NIIN combination. If the DoDAAC and NSN/ NIIN
   combination is found, the retrieved data is displayed on the “Base Levels” page. If the
   DoDAAC and NSN/ NIIN combination is not found, the retrieved data is displayed on the
   “New Base Levels” page. See paragraph 13.18.4 for how to view levels.

   6.7.2. Updating RAMP Levels. If RAMP levels data become corrupted for any reason, it is
   best to request that the data be corrected within and regenerated from the source system
   rather than to make manual changes directly in RAMP.
       6.7.2.1. The “Levels” page does provide capability for users to manually update levels
       for any base retail activity (SBSS) DoDAAC and NSN/NIIN combination that already
       exists in the levels database. It is not possible to view/update/add depot retail activity
       (D035K) levels manually within RAMP. There are also no depot wholesale levels
       (D035A) within RAMP.
       6.7.2.2. Any creation or updating of levels by the user is temporary because the next
       levels overlay received from the reporting DoDAAC will replace whatever the user
       changed. See paragraph 13.18.4 for how to modify levels.
   6.7.3. Creating a New Levels Record in RAMP. If a base retail activity DoDAAC and
   NSN/NIIN combination does not exist in the database, it may be added. Initially, all levels
   are set to zero (‘0’) and the ‘as of date’ is set to the current date. See paragraph 13.18.4 on
   how to establish levels.
6.8. Excess Computation. Retail activity excess is defined as any quantity of serviceable retail
activity-held assets that is greater than the computed requirement. For ERRC “N,” “P,” and “T”
items, RAMP is responsible for forwarding the excess quantity by retail activity to D035A for
redistribution purposes.
   6.8.1. Excess computations are performed for each DoDAAC by consolidating all ownership
   accounts into one asset/level detail record. The detail record is available to RAMP users via
   the DoDAAC or NSN ‘Assets & Levels Report’ option. A detail record is maintained for
   every ownership account at a given reporting activity.
   6.8.2. The excess computation process has two stages:
       6.8.2.1. The first stage runs periodically throughout the day and pulls directly from
       operational data. This stage treats all NSNs as bachelor items (i.e., no I&SG is applied)
       and does not at this point have exclusion logic for items or DoDAACs for which excess
       will not be computed.
           6.8.2.1.1. For all ERRC “T” items and for any ERRC “N” or “P” items with Critical
           Item code of ‘C’ or management code of ‘M,’ excess is computed as follows: (SERV
           + RSP BAL) minus (REQ OBJ + BASE D-O + UNCF RDO SERV + Limited
           Inaccessible Balance + Total Inaccessible Balance). The Unconfirmed Serviceable
           RDOs (UNCF RDO SERV) are calculated from open orders that show the retail
           activity as the ship-from location.
           6.8.2.1.2. For ERRC “N” or “P” items that have neither a Critical Item code of ‘C’ or
           management code “M,” excess is computed as follows: (SERV + RSP BAL) minus
           (REQ OBJ + Limited Inaccessible Balance + Total Inaccessible Balance).
       6.8.2.2. The second stage applies both I&SG and exclusion logic and is detailed in Table
       6.8.

Table 6.8. Excess Computation I&SG and Exclusion Logic
Family         Logic
Relationship
Bachelor       If the results of the excess computation are not greater than zero, they are
Items          disregarded. Distributable excess is computed except as follows:
               1. The results of the first phase excess computation are not greater than zero.
               2. The DoDAAC applies to a depot retail organization (FB20__ or FB70__).
               3. The DoDAAC is not a retail activity supply account (i.e., DoDAAC is other
               than FB____ or FE____).
               4. The DoDAAC is on the ‘No Compute’ list.
               5. The DoDAAC has ‘Limited Compute’ code ‘L’.
               6. The NIIN has ‘No Compute’ code ‘N’.
               7. The NIIN has command peculiar code ‘P’ and SOS ‘FPK’, ‘FPD’ or ‘FG5’.
               8. The NIIN is a kit item.
               9. The NIIN is flagged as a life of system stock item.
               10. The NIIN has ‘Limited Compute’ code ‘L’.
               11. The NIIN/DoDAAC combination has ‘No Compute’ code ‘N’.
               12. The NIIN/DoDAAC combination has ‘Limited Compute’ code ‘L’.
I&SG Items     The excess computation is performed for each family member and resulting
               negative balances are considered shortages. Standard I&SG rules are used in
               applying excesses against shortages within the family. Shortages in lower
               subgroups are considered as a requirement in the next higher subgroup.
               Excesses from lower subgroups are not applied to higher subgroups.
               Distributable excess is reported against the least preferred family member with
               assets. The same exceptions for computing distributable excess for Bachelor
               items also apply to I&SG items. The following provides additional exceptions
               for computing distributable excess unique to I&SG items:
               1. Family master NIIN has ‘No Compute’ Code ‘N’.
               2. Family master NIIN has command peculiar ‘P’ and SOS ‘FPK’, ‘FPD’ or
               ‘FG5’.
               3. Family master NIIN is a kit item.
               4. Family master NIIN is flagged as a life of system stock item.
               5. Family master NIIN/DoDAAC combination has “No Compute” code ‘N’.

       6.8.2.3. Exclusions to the excess computation process are:
           6.8.2.3.1. Presence of a confirmation quantity or RDO denial code that indicates the
           retail activity has not submitted a current asset/level report.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                  319


         6.8.2.3.2. Date of last requisition is more current than the stock balance report “as of
         date”.
  6.8.3. Distributable excess balances from the second phase of the excess computation
  process are stored and then transmitted daily to D035A on transactions with DIC ‘ZBE.’
     6.8.3.1. D035A Site Functional OPRs can also use the OVRH screen to trigger D035A
     generation of transactions with DIC ‘ZBE’. See paragraph 13.11.2.
     6.8.3.2. When a transaction with DIC ‘ZBE’ is received from RAMP or triggered
     internally, D035A takes action as following:
         6.8.3.2.1. If D035A has an existing base excess asset balance record, but the latest
         feed from RAMP does not contain a ‘ZBE’ for the same base DoDAAC/NSN
         combination, the D035A base excess asset balance record is deleted.
         6.8.3.2.2. The quantity on the ‘ZBE’ transaction is reduced by any unconfirmed
         shipments created by D035A on the previous day in an attempt to prevent the system
         from using the same asset to fill multiple BOs.
         6.8.3.2.3. If there is a priority ‘04’ through ‘15’ BO for the reporting DoDAAC and
         NIIN combination, it is ‘FB’ cancelled in D035A. This BO cannot be reinstated from
         the REVA screen as long as RAMP continues to send D035A the ‘ZBE’ transaction.
         D035A will also continue to send new RDO transactions with DIC ‘A2_’ to the
         reporting activity directing redistribution of what it still believes are excess assets.
            6.8.3.2.3.1. The data must be corrected in RAMP (i.e., the base must send current
            asset and level data to RAMP) to stop the creation of the ‘ZBE’ transaction.
            6.8.3.2.3.2. A D035A Site Functional OPR user can then reinstate the base’s BO
            using the REVA screen. See paragraph 13.5.1 for sample of a reversal action.
         6.8.3.2.4. If the ‘ZBE’ transaction increased the current balance on a base excess
         asset balance record, D035A processes an RBO transaction that may result in the
         automatic release of materiel to fill a BO (MRC and level checks may stop this
         release action). Refer to Chapter 3 for additional details on this process.
         6.8.3.2.5. If a ‘ZBE’ transaction is received for 60 consecutive days for the same
         base DoDAAC/NSN combination and D035A is a SICA for the NSN, D035A
         processes an ‘FTE’ report of excess transaction that is sent to the PICA. Refer to
         Chapter 3 for additional details on this process.
  6.8.4. The “Excesses” page provides users with RAMP/WHSL AFMC Lead Functional OPR
  access the capability to change the criteria for excess computation for a specific DoDAAC
  and NSN/NIIN combination. See paragraph 13.11.2 on how to use this screen. Table 6.9
  details what to change, when and why.

Table 6.9. Decision Matrix for Changes to Excess Computation Criteria
Level              Choice
DoDAAC Level       1. If the MAJCOM and AF/A4 have agreed that the DoDAAC will not be
                   used for redistribution purposes, the user can select the ‘Do not compute
                   excesses for any item at this DoDAAC’ radio button.
                   2. If the MAJCOM and AF/A4 have agreed that the DoDAAC can be used
                   for limited redistribution purposes, the user can select the “Perform Limited
                   Compute for this DoDAAC” radio button.
                   3. Otherwise the user can select the “Compute excesses for this DoDAAC”
                   radio button.
Item Level         1. If the IM has determined a situation warrants this NSN to be treated as a
                   problem item which must be 100% manually redistributed, the user can select
                   the “Do not compute excesses for this item at any DoDAAC” radio button.
                   2. If the IM has determined a situation warrants this NSN to be treated as a
                   problem item (e.g., I&SG problems), but automatic redistribution is valid, the
                   user can select the “Perform Limited Compute for this Item” radio button.
                   3. Otherwise, the user can select the “Compute excesses for this item” radio
                   button.
Combined           1. If the MAJCOM and AF/A4 have agreed that the DoDAAC will not be
DoDAAC/Item        used for redistribution purposes and the IM has determined that the NSN also
Level              will not be used for redistribution purposes, the user can select the “Do not
                   compute excesses for this item at this DoDAAC” radio button.
                   2. If the MAJCOM and AF/A4 have agreed that the DoDAAC will not be
                   used for redistribution purposes and the IM has determined that the NSN can
                   only be used for limited redistribution purposes, the user can select the
                   “Perform Limited Compute for this item at this DoDAAC” radio button.
                   3. Otherwise the user can select the “Compute excesses for this item at this
                   DoDAAC” radio button.

   6.8.5. It is unlikely that the user would change data in the “Item Characteristics” area
   established using existing RAMP logic (updated internally via transactions with DIC ‘XE4’
   and ‘ZBD’); however, see paragraph 13.18.3 for how to do this. “Item Characteristics” are
   defined as follows:
        6.8.5.1. The “tight item” characteristic applies to items for which BOs exist.
        6.8.5.2. The “command peculiar” characteristic applies to items used by only one
        command and for which all available assets are stored within that command.
        6.8.5.3. The “life of system stock” characteristic applies to items for which assets are
        retained at retail level for the following reasons: to support aircraft or missile systems; to
        support aircraft or missile subsystems/equipment; and to prevent the premature disposal
        of communications, electronics and meteorological systems and equipment.

6.9. Impact of Retail Requisitioning on RAMP.
   6.9.1. D035K and SBSS requisition either immediately for customer due-outs (e.g., local
   maintenance orders) or for stock re-leveling. Orders for stock are usually submitted during
   end-of-the-day processing. The stock re-leveling process compares total assets to total
   requirements and triggers D035K or SBSS to requisition the difference.
       6.9.1.1. Assets used in the comparison include those on-hand, Due-In From Maintenance
       (DIFM) and due-in from wholesale (i.e., requisitions already submitted). These
       requisitions usually go to the item ICP, but not always; instead, they could be directed for
       lateral support between two retail customers. Due-ins are included in the assets-to-
       requirements comparison regardless of requisition status (e.g., BB, BA, confirmed
       shipped, etc.) because quantities already on order do not need to be re-requisitioned.
       Due-ins will match what D035A shows as due-out plus any serviceable intransit to the
       retail activity.
       6.9.1.2. Requirements used in the asset-to-requirements comparison include Peacetime
       Operating Support (POS) and Readiness Spares Package (RSP) levels. RBL determines a
       worldwide POS level for an item and then allocates this requirement to D035K and SBSS
       (see Volume 3). These levels replace the Repair Cycle Demand Level (RCDL) as the
       POS portion of the Requisitioning Objective (RO). For processing details, see Volume 4
       for D035K and AFH 23-123, Volume 2, Part 1, ILS-S, Materiel Management Operations,
       for SBSS. D035K and SBSS provide POS, RSP and RO quantities to RAMP. RAMP
       then provides this data to EXPRESS. This sequence of events happens each time RBL
       pushes levels to the retail activities (usually quarterly).
   6.9.2. Retail Requisitions above the RO. A retail activity can order above its RO if it has
   firm due-outs (e.g., local maintenance order). For example, if a retail activity RO is 10 and it
   has two firm due outs, this activity can order up to 12 assets.
6.10. Intransit Control.
   6.10.1. RAMP records actions associated with the shipment and receipt of AF-managed
   ERRC “N,” “P,” and “T” items in addition to any ERRC “S” and “U” critical items. As used
   in this section, the term intransit control signifies the recording of assets from the time of
   shipment from one AF accountable record until receipt has been acknowledged from another
   AF accountable record. When affecting transactions are properly recorded in RAMP, it can
   serve as a source of information for accurately identifying quantities and items that are
   intransit between accountable activities.
   6.10.2. RAMP receives intransit data from three sources: data created from the utilization of
   a sync process from the D035A orders database; data from base and depot retail lateral
   support shipments (shipments from one retail activity to another); and data from base retail
   shipments to contractors. RAMP uses data from these three sources to establish two types of
   intransit records: Unconfirmed RDO and Confirmed RDO intransits.
       6.10.2.1. D035A Synchronized Intransit Records. D035A considers an order as an
       Unconfirmed RDO intransit when a requisition (DIC A0_, A3_ or A4_) has been released
       for shipment and placed in status code BA. When a requisition’s status is changed to a
       shipment confirmation (transaction with DIC ‘AR_’ or ‘BL_’) D035A changes the status
       from an Unconfirmed RDO balance to a Confirmed RDO intransit quantity. When the
 322                                                       AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


       materiel is received, the customer submits a receipt transaction with DIC ‘D6_’ and a
       receipt acknowledgement transaction with DIC ‘DRA’ through DAAS to D035A.
       D035A uses the transaction with DIC ‘DRA’ to close its orders record and the Confirmed
       RDO intransit record is removed.
       6.10.2.2. Retail Shipments.
           6.10.2.2.1. AF base retail and AF depot retail activities create notice of shipment
           transactions (i.e., automatic unserviceable returns and shipments from one base to
           another not directed by the IM via lateral support). For shipments to contractors, AF
           base retail activities and AF depot retail activities, this shipment transaction
           establishes a RAMP intransit record. It also creates an intransit data adjustment
           transaction for the RAMP detail record unless the DoDAAC beginning with ‘FY’ is
           not found on the RIC to DoDAAC conversion table. Unmatched ‘FY’ DoDAACs are
           bypassed.
           6.10.2.2.2. AF base retail and AF depot retail activities use notices of shipment
           denial to reverse the action created by a previous notice of shipment (transaction with
           DIC ‘X2A’). RAMP uses this intransit data adjustment transaction to reduce the
           RAMP detail record.
           6.10.2.2.3. Receipt of shipment confirmation transactions with DIC ‘AR_’ and ‘BL_’
           prompt RAMP to apply transportation information to the intransit records for use in
           preparing receipt acknowledgment follow-ups.            Receipt of an unmatched
           confirmation of shipment via lateral support (non-IM directed) triggers RAMP to
           establish both an intransit record and an intransit data adjustment (transaction with
           DIC ‘Z2A’) unless the ‘FY’ Consignee DoDAAC is not found on the RIC to
           DoDAAC conversion table. Unmatched ‘FY’ DoDAACs are bypassed.
           6.10.2.2.4. Receipt of transactions with DIC ‘DRA’ or ‘D6_’ from AF base retail and
           AF depot retail activities indicate to RAMP that the consignee record has been
           updated with a receipt and the intransit record for that document number and NSN
           combination will be closed. The date of receipt (date posted to consignee record) is
           posted to the matching RAMP intransit record, completing the intransit record. An
           intransit data adjustment transaction with DIC ‘Z2A’ is also created for the RAMP
           detail record to decrease Confirmed RDO intransits. If the receipt is for an
           Unconfirmed RDO, an intransit data adjustment with adjustment code ‘F’ is created
           to decrease the “unconfirmed RDO” balance. If a matching intransit record does not
           exist, an intransit record is established.
6.11. RAMP Table Updates. Transactions that pass RAMP edits are used to update RAMP
database tables. As each transaction is received in RAMP and posted to the appropriate table,
data within each transaction creates events that are also posted to appropriate fields on pertinent
tables.
   6.11.1. Table 6.10. shows the transaction DICs that update each database table and the types
   of data that table contains.

   6.11.2. Table 6 11 through Table 6.14 show which transactions contain information that
   updates specific fields within RAMP (e.g., unserviceable, serviceable, DIFM, etc.). Note:
   Although SBSS does not report data by actual SCC, these tables reflect O/P ‘I’ with SCC I.
   RAMP distinguishes one condition from another by assigning an Asset Type to each unit
   (e.g., Serviceable, Unserviceable, etc. as seen on the “Base Assets” page).
         6.11.2.1. In the ‘Transaction’ column, the following applies: (o) = overlay; (+) = added
         to; (-) = subtracted from; and ‘Data Sync’ is the overlay of D035 asset balances from the
         mainframes to the Midtier.
         6.11.2.2. The ‘Database Type’ column contains the plain English field names (e.g.,
         programming field name “Deficitreclaimablebalance” is shown as “Deficit Reclaimable
         Balance”) under which differing categories of assets and levels are maintained on the
         Rpt_Ast_Sum_Data_001 database where data is stored for reports.
         6.11.2.3. RAMP applies these same SCC categories in the SB&CR data sent to the
         requirements determination system.

     6.11.3. Transactions with DIC ‘XCB’ and ‘XCE’ are now processed by the D035E
     Readiness Based Leveling (RBL) subsystem and posted to a database from which RAMP
     pulls information as needed (see Volume 2, Readiness Based Leveling (RBL) Users’ Manual
     (D035E), for RBL procedures).
     6.11.4. An update to the ‘Materiel Assets Statistics’ table is made only if the DoDAAC
     begins with an “F.”
     6.11.5. Table 6 15 shows the data used to notify the ‘Populate Report Assets Summary
     Data’ stored procedure that an asset balance has changed. This tells RAMP it is time either
     to recalculate and re-populate the ‘Report Assets Summary Data’ table or re-calculate excess
     for this NSN and DoDAAC combination. This table also shows which types of transactions
     affect which part of RAMP. DoDAACs and NIINs are copied from the ‘Operation’ table and
     used to populate the ‘Report Assets Summary Event’ table.

6.12. Stock Balance & Consumption Reporting (SB&CR). The Consumption Balances page
allows the user to view and update RAMP SB&CR data. Data must only be changed within
RAMP as a last resort. Any creation or updating of SB&CR data by the user is temporary; the
next SB&CR overlay received from the reporting DoDAAC will replace whatever the user
changed. If data within RAMP is incorrect, the best option is to request that the data be
corrected and regenerated from the sending system instead of just changing the data in RAMP.

SB&CR data.

Section 6C—Reparable Item Movement Control System (RIMCS).

6.13. Overview.
   6.13.1. RIMCS is the process that provides guidance for AF management and processing of
   materiel which becomes unserviceable at a retail activity and must be moved from the retail
   activity to a SOR, a storage location or a disposal location when local maintenance does not
   have the capability or authority to repair the item. It is possible for a base to report
   unserviceable on-hand assets back to RAMP rather than shipping the materiel IAW RIMCS.
   If the RIMCS information for the applicable item includes at least one ship-to Site, RAMP
   will immediately and automatically RDO those unserviceable assets from the reporting base
   for shipment to the DoDAAC identified in the “Ship-To-Site”.
   6.13.2. The following ERRC codes apply: “P”; “T”; and “N” if there is a pending change
   from an ERRC “N” to “P” or “T.”
   6.13.3. RIMCS information consists of priority designator, RIMCS Effective Date, Control
   Code, three ship-to site designations, project code, mark-for, and Reliability Improvement
   Warranty Routing Identifier (RIW R/I).
6.14. RIMCS Process.
   6.14.1. The process is affected by the daily synchronization of data from D035A to RAMP
   and online file maintenance by the IM.
   6.14.2. If an item record is added or changed in a D035 item database, it is synchronized to
   the RAMP/WHSL item database during a nightly process.
       6.14.2.1. Lean Logistics (LL) code updates change only the priority Code and Effective
       Date in RIMCS. See Chapter 3 for detailed information regarding LL code assignment.
          6.14.2.1.1. If the LL code is ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘L’ or ‘M’, RAMP sets the priority code to 03.
          6.14.2.1.2. If the LL code is a blank or “X,” RAMP sets the priority code to ‘13’. If
          the new RIMCS Control Code is blank (RIMCS data is not assigned) and the old
          RIMCS Control Code had a value, then a transaction with DIC ‘BDR’/‘Z’ is
          forwarded to D043A to delete the RIMCS information.
          6.14.2.1.3. IMs cannot downgrade a RIMCS priority code ‘03’ if the LL code is ‘A’,
          ‘C’, ‘L’ or ‘M’; however, an IM can manually upgrade a priority code ‘13’ to ‘03’.
          6.14.2.1.4. RAMP forwards a transaction with DIC ‘BDR’ to D043 advising of any
          change in priority code.
       6.14.2.2. If the RIC changes on an item with an automatically-assigned RIMCS Control
       Code (‘F’ or ‘T’), RAMP will automatically default the Ship-to-Site 1 to the new SOS
       DoDAAC as shown in Table 6.18. It will also set the project code, mark-for, Contractor
       RIW, Ship-to-Site 2 and Ship-to-Site 3 to ‘blank’.

current data values. For information regarding Depot Wholesale
NWRM RIMCS processes, see Chapter 5.

       6.14.2.3. If the RIC changes on an item with a manually-assigned RIMCS control code
       (A – E, G – H, J – K, N, or Z), RAMP will assign RIMCS data as follows:
          6.14.2.3.1. For items with ERRC code “N,” “S,” or “U,” no RIMCS data is assigned.
          6.14.2.3.2. For “K” or “NC” stock numbers, no RIMCS data is assigned.
          6.14.2.3.3. For items with ERRC code “P” where the critical item code is not ‘C’ and
          the management code is not ‘M’, no RIMCS data is assigned.
          6.14.2.3.4. Data is not found in D043 for items with File Maintenance Code ‘D’ ‘N’
          or ‘U’; rather, such data is user-maintained and no RIMCS data is assigned.
          6.14.2.3.5. For items with AAC and/or phrase code “N,” RAMP assigns RIMCS
          Control Code ‘F’ and sets the Ship-to-Site 1, Ship-to-Site 2, Ship-to-Site 3, project
          code and mark-for to blank.
          6.14.2.3.6. For items where the AF SICA NIMSC is 5, the IM must contact the PICA
          to determine if this default location is still valid for this repair action. It is imperative
          that the IM ensures this location is correct because if this location is not valid, the
          PICA will not provide carcass credit for the items returned. The default values
          assigned are as shown in Table 6.19.

         6.14.2.4. For all NSNs assigned a RIMCS Control Code, RAMP also assigns priority
         codes based on the LL as noted in paragraph 6.14.2.1 above.
         6.14.2.5. The Effective Date is updated to the current date.
   6.14.3. It is the IM’s responsibility to maintain current, accurate RIMCS data in RAMP. See
   paragraph 13.18.6 for a sample format to manually update RIMCS information. The IM
   can update seven RIMCS-related data elements as shown in Table 13.10. See Table 6.20 for
   a list of RIMCS Control Codes.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                      335


Table 6.20. RIMCS Control Codes
Circumstance Code Definition
Non-Excess             Applies when the total serviceable plus unserviceable assets are equal to
                       or below the worldwide minimum retention level (reference Note
                A      below). It also applies when there are multiple repair sites or there is a
                       single repair site other than the prime storage site. This code tells the
                       installation to ship the unserviceable item to nearest activity indicated.
Unserviceable   When the serviceable assets are below the world-wide minimum retention level,
Excess          but the total serviceable plus unserviceable assets exceed worldwide minimum
                retention level, the following codes apply (reference Note below):
                       1. CONUS installations ship to nearest activity indicated.
                B      2. OCONUS installations dispose of item when it is beyond the
                       installation’s repair capability or is unserviceable excess to that base’s
                       requirements.
                       1. CONUS installations ship to nearest activity indicated.
                C      2. OCONUS installations are to report to IM for disposition
                       instructions.
                       1. CONUS installations report to IM for disposition instructions.
                D      2. OCONUS installations dispose of item when it is beyond the base’s
                       repair capability or is unserviceable excess to that base’s requirement.
                       Disposition requests will be forwarded by both CONUS and OCONUS
                E
                       installations to the IM.
Special                1. Applies to ERRC codes “N,” “P,” and “T.”
                       2. Shipment will be made to disposal.
                       3. This applies to items that have been cataloged as disposal type items
                       with AAC Y and phrase code N.
                F
                       4. Bases dispose of all assets that are beyond local repair capability.
                       5. This code cannot be file maintained by the IM; rather, it is only
                       created when RAMP receives notice that the item is AAC Y with
                       phrase code N.
                       1. Designates an item under a RIW.
                       2. The RIW contractor DoDAAC will be entered in the SOR and all
                       RIW items must also reflect project code 390.
                G
                       3. This code is only used when all the items in inventory are covered
                       by the RIW. If some items are not covered by RIW, then a code other
                       than ‘G’ will be used.
                H      1. Used for ERRC “N” and “P” items that are being re-cataloged as

Circumstance Code Definition
                       ERRC code “T.”
                       2. Once the cataloging change is complete, RAMP will change the
                       control code from ‘H’ to ‘A’.
                       1. Used for ERRC “P” items considered critical.
                       2. This code tells the bases to return unserviceable items to a SOR for
                J      possible repair.
                       3. Items with this control code require that save code ‘S’ be file
                       maintained in D035K to prevent disposal of unserviceable items.
                       1. Used when an item that was coded as disposal (AAC Y and phrase
                       code N) is being reinstated as an active item in the AF catalog.
                K      2. This will prevent further shipments of unserviceable items to
                       disposal.
                       3. This code will undo the RIMCS code ‘F’ and can be input by the IM.
                       1. Applies to ERRC “P” items that have been designated as centralized
                N      intermediate repair.
                       2. Items beyond the base’s ability to repair will be reported to the IM.
                       1. Internally assigned by RAMP when a new item enters the system
                       from cataloging.
                       2. This code cannot be manually assigned.
                T      3. The ship-to DoDAAC will be based on the SOS code. Example:
                       item is managed by ‘FHZ;’ therefore, the SOR is going to be ‘FB2039’.
                       4. This code will be reviewed by the IM to see if it needs to be changed
                       to another more accurate code.
                       1. Can be input by the IM.
                       2. This action will cause RAMP to delete current RIMCS data for the
                Z      NSN/NIIN on the screen and in the RAMP system; but, when the ‘Z’
                       control code is input, RAMP will automatically reinstate the original
                       default RIMCS that was on the NSN/NIIN, update the effective date
                       and generate a transaction with DIC ‘BDR’ to D043.
Note: For computing items, the minimum retention level is found in the D200 computation
under worldwide levels.

6.15. RIMCS Data Flow.
   6.15.1. Whether RIMCS data is updated via online file maintenance or from database
   synchronization, RAMP immediately posts valid changes to the appropriate database and
   generates update transactions to an outbound message queue for accumulation and
   subsequent transmission to D043 daily. Note: RIMCS information for RAMP-reportable
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                   337


  AFMC-managed items using the D035 suite of subsystems must be established/maintained in
  RAMP. It is not constructive to make RIMCS updates directly to D043.
  6.15.2. D043 usually processes RIMCS updates within 24-hours from RAMP generation and
  forwards the changes to D035K to reach depot retail activities directly and worldwide
  through the SNUD to reach base retail activities via subsequent interfaces.
  6.15.3. SNUD creates a data packet of transactions with DIC “BDR” for each registered base
  retail user of the NSN being updated and forwards these to the Defense Enterprise
  Computing Center (DECC) for transmission to users. The DECC receives data through the
  Host Automated Message Processing System (HAMPS), which automatically goes into the
  Base Level Automated Message Extraction System (BLAMES). BLAMES, in turn,
  automatically forwards the data to the correct applications inbound file, in this case the SBSS
  Supply Interface System (SIFS) file. An SBSS SIFS operator manually triggers the SIFS
  SNUD handler (SBSS program NGV243) in conjunction with Master SIFS Inbound Dispatch
  Utility (SBSS program NGV230). The number of daily SIFS processing cycles is
  determined locally. Inbound SNUD data is then grouped into one of three areas with SIFS
  processing each group differently. The groups are:
     6.15.3.1. SNUD data without an effective date is passed by SIFS to the pseudo for
     immediate processing.
     6.15.3.2. SNUD data which has an effective date is held until the effective date is
     reached. Until then, the data images are stored on the SIFS SNUD data image record
     (729 Record).
     6.15.3.3. I&SG data is stored and used by SBSS program NGV404.
  6.15.4. After the information gets to the retail activities, it is automatically loaded into the
  appropriate tables/databases with one exception. For base retail customers, if RIMCS data
  reflects multiple SORs, SBSS creates an “F006 Reject Notice.” Logistics Readiness
  Squadron (LRS) personnel must review the notice, determine the SOR closest to them and
  reprocess the transaction through SBSS (refer to AFH 23-123).
  6.15.5. From an SBSS perspective, the RIMCS data process starts when a new NSN is
  loaded to the SBSS database. Whenever an ERRC code “T” NSN is loaded, SBSS
  automatically creates a “shell” repair cycle record and loads a RIMCS priority 00, a
  disposition code “RPT,” and an effective date 00000. SBSS then generates a transaction with
  Transaction Identification Code (TRIC) BDF/A and transmits it to SNUD to register the base
  as a user of that NSN. In response, SNUD provides the base with stock control, RIMCS,
  transportation, I&SG and ammunition data. When RIMCS data is received from SNUD and
  processed by SBSS, the ‘shell’ repair cycle record is updated with the current data. LRS
  personnel can interrogate SNUD if they have reason to believe SBSS data is incorrect. This
  interrogation capability allows SBSS to validate SNUD data one NSN at a time. This
  process is used on an exception basis (refer to AFH 23-123). Annual SNUD Reconciliation
  is intended to ensure SBSS records are accurate.
  6.15.6. D043/RAMP Weekly RIMCS Reconciliation. RAMP compares a file it receives
  weekly from D043 with what it has recorded and generates ”BDR” transactions back to D043
  to update that system to reflect what is in RAMP.

      6.15.6.1. These transactions are visible on the SCS Midtier by following this path: click
      on the ”Levels” button; select ”Data on RBL FTP Server” from the drop-down menu;
      click on the “Top of FTP Directory Structure” hyperlink toward the top of the page; click
      on the ”refresh” button to make sure the browser displays the most current data; click the
      “BDR_Recon” hyperlink.
      6.15.6.2. To see all the ”BDR” transactions generated most recently, look for files with
      labels that begin ”BDRSITE...” The D043 data date is found within the label. To see a
      breakout of specific IM MDCs, click on the desired ICP hyperlink (i.e., FGZ, FHZ or
      FLZ); the displayed file names contain the IM MDCs. To see a breakout of the specific
      CICPs, click on the ”CICP” hyperlink; the displayed file name contain the CICP RICs.

           D035A, RAMP AND WHSL PROCESSES RELATED TO REPAIR

7.1. General.
   7.1.1. AF employs five types of maintenance activities to repair items of supply: Depot
   Maintenance Interservice Support Agreement (DMISA); Contract; Depot Organic;
   Centralized Repair Facility (CRF); and Base.
   7.1.2. This chapter identifies and describes the touch points between these service providers
   and D035A, RAMP and WHSL.
7.2. DMISA Repair.
   7.2.1. DMISA repair is governed by an agreement between two or more DoD agencies when
   one DoD agency, referred to as the Repair Agent, agrees to provide depot maintenance
   support to another DoD agency, referred to as the Principal. The following details DMISA-
   related processes used to provide the Principal with visibility of their assets located at the
   Repair Agent’s repair and storage facilities.
   7.2.2. Establishing a DMISA. Refer to AFI 21-102, Depot Maintenance Management and
   DoDI 4000.19, Interservice and Intergovernmental Support for DoD-approved policy and
   procedures for establishing a DMISA.
      7.2.2.1. Once a DMISA agreement has been established, ICP personnel, the Maintenance
      Interservice Support Office (MISO) or the D035A Site Functional OPR must notify a
      D035A AFMC Lead Functional OPR to update the ‘Repair Activity Site Information
      Maintenance’ table within D035A. See paragraph 13.20.15. The following information
      must be provided:
          7.2.2.1.1. The DoDAAC and RIC of the Repair Agent’s repair facility.
          7.2.2.1.2. The DoDAAC and RIC of the storage facility collocated with the Repair
          Agent’s repair facility. The storage and repair facilities may be assigned the same
          DoDAAC and RIC values.
          7.2.2.1.3. Whether to consider the Repair Agent as repair-and-return. It is very
          important to know whether the Repair Agent’s data system can successfully process
          an MRO transaction from D035A. If it cannot, the Repair Agent must be designated
          as a repair-and-return site (i.e., repaired assets are automatically returned to an AF
          depot by the Repair Agent) to prevent D035A from automatically generating MRO
          transactions.
      7.2.2.2. In most cases, the Repair Agent’s repair facility is collocated with a DLA
      storage facility that utilizes DSS (e.g., the Army depot maintenance facility at
      Tobyhanna, PA Repair Agent utilizes a local DSS for storage and the DoDAAC/RIC of
      the repair facility is ‘BYF’/‘W90CGG’, but the DoDAAC/RIC of the storage facility is
      ‘BY6’/‘W25G1W’.); however, in some instances, the Repair Agent’s repair and storage
      facilities use the same DoDAAC and RIC, because the storage facility does not use DSS
      (e.g., the Navy depot maintenance facility at Crane, IN and the collocated storage facility
      both use DoDAAC/RIC ‘N00164’/‘P64’). When this happens, the physical movement of
 340                                                         AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


         materiel between the Repair Agent’s repair and storage facilities is not controlled by the
         Principal.
         7.2.2.3. Use the ‘Repair Activity Site Information Maintenance’ table on the SCS
         Midtier to view any established DMISA. Only those assigned a D035A AFMC Lead
         Functional OPR user role can update this table. Any modifications to this table are
         copied in near real time to the mainframe DMISA Sites table maintained for each AFMC
         ICP. Table 7.1 shows DMISA sites.

   7.2.3. Relocating Unserviceable Materiel to the Repair Agent’s Storage Facility. The
   DMISA process is initiated when the Principal ships unserviceable materiel (SCCs D, E, F,
   G, J or K) to the Repair Agent’s storage facility in one of three ways:
         7.2.3.1. The wholesale IM file maintains RIMCS data in RAMP to direct the automatic
         shipment of unserviceable materiel from an SBSS retail activity to the Repair Agent’s
         storage facility. See Chapter 6 for additional details on RIMCS procedures.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                341


         7.2.3.1.1. An SBSS RIMCS shipment generates an issue transaction with DIC
         ‘D7M’, an ‘FB’ document number, ‘M’ signal code and the Repair Agent’s storage
         facility DoDAAC in the SUPADD field. SBSS sends the ‘D7M’ transaction to the
         managing D035A at End of Day (EOD).
         7.2.3.1.2. When D035A receives this issue transaction, it forwards a copy to RAMP
         for intransit tracking purposes. Because there is no shipment confirmation transaction
         with DIC ‘BL0’ associated with this shipment, RAMP uses the ‘D7M’ transaction to
         establish an open intransit record.
         7.2.3.1.3. D035A also uses the ‘D7M’ transaction to create and send a Pre-position
         Materiel Receipt Data (PMRD) transaction with DIC ‘DWK’ to the Repair Agent’s
         DSS storage facility RIC. The ‘DWK’ transaction instructs the storage facility to
         place the materiel in AF ownership upon receipt.
     7.2.3.2. The wholesale IM requests the depot RIM to load the required Maintenance
     Repair Code (MRC) Source of Repair activity DoDAAC and RIC data into D035K so
     that at turn-in, SCC F assets are automatically shipped to the Repair Agent’s storage
     facility using a transaction with DIC Y5A.
         7.2.3.2.1. DIC Y5A transaction contains an ‘FB’ document number, ‘M’ signal code
         and the Repair Agent’s storage facility DoDAAC in the SUPADD field.
         7.2.3.2.2. Because an automatic shipment in D035K may not be visible in D035A
         and may not generate the desired ‘DWK’ transaction to the Repair Agent’s storage
         facility, this option must only be used for items that are carcass-constrained.
         7.2.3.2.3. An automatic shipment from D035K does create an open intransit record in
         RAMP once the shipment confirmation transaction with DIC ‘AR0’ generated by
         DSS posts in the collocated D035K.
     7.2.3.3. The wholesale IM will use the D035A NEW screen to enter a relocation
     shipment transaction with DIC ‘A0A’ when it is necessary to direct shipment of
     unserviceable materiel from a wholesale storage activity to the Repair Agent’s storage
     facility DoDAAC. See Chapter 5 for additional details pertaining to shipments between
     storage sites and to use of ‘V3’ action code.
         7.2.3.3.1. When D035A processes this ‘A0A’ transaction and it sends an Order synch
         transaction to RAMP for intransit tracking purposes and sends a ‘DWK’ PMRD
         transaction to the Repair Agent’s storage facility RIC.
         7.2.3.3.2. RAMP creates an open intransit record once the ‘AR0’ or ‘BL0’ shipment
         confirmation transaction posts in D035A.
         7.2.3.3.3. It is important to note that the D035A DMISA process is not currently
         designed to include shipments of serviceable materiel (i.e., SCC A, B or C), quality
         deficient materiel (i.e., SCC Q) or beyond economic repair materiel (i.e., SCC H, P or
         R) to the Repair Agent’s storage facility.
  7.2.4. Receipt of Unserviceable Materiel at the Repair Agent’s Storage Facility.
     7.2.4.1. Asset Balance Update. Upon receipt of unserviceable materiel, the storage
     facility sends a Materiel Receipt transaction with DIC D6_ to D035A through DAAS.
342                                                       AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


         7.2.4.1.1. The Document number used by the storage facility to generate the DIC
         D6_ transaction will be the same document number that was used to ship the
         unserviceable materiel to the storage facility.
         7.2.4.1.2. If the ‘DWK’ transaction sent in conjunction with the shipment of materiel
         to the Repair Agent’s storage facility is used to build the receipt transaction, then
         DSS puts DIC ‘D6K’ in the transaction it forwards to DAAS.
      7.2.4.2. Financial Inventory Balance Update. Upon receipt of the ‘D6_’ transaction from
      the Repair Agent’s storage facility, D035A increases the inventory balance for that
      storage facility RIC and provides a copy of the receipt to the D035J subsystem for
      financial reporting.
      7.2.4.3. Open Shipment and Intransit Record Updates.
         7.2.4.3.1. For a ”V3” manager-forced action relocation shipment from D035A where
         the ‘D6_’ document number exactly matches the shipment document number, D035A
         processes a ‘DRA’ receipt acknowledgement transaction to close that open shipment
         and to close the RAMP intransit record via an Order synch transaction. If the ‘D6_’
         document number does not exactly match the shipment document number, no ‘DRA’
         transaction will be created by D035A; so, the intransit record will not be closed.
         After approximately 90 days, D035A will force close its relocation shipment. This
         action will force close the intransit record in RAMP.
         7.2.4.3.2. For a RIMCS shipment from SBSS or an automatic shipment from D035K,
         D035A forwards a copy of the ‘D6_’ receipt transaction to RAMP. The ‘D6_’
         transaction is used by RAMP to close an open intransit record. If the ‘D6_’ document
         number does not exactly match the shipment document number, the intransit record
         will not be closed. If the wholesale IM does not manually research these open
         intransit shipments, after approximately 130 days, RAMP will force close the record.
  7.2.5. Request for Unserviceable Materiel to Repair by the Repair Agent.
      7.2.5.1. Repair Agent Facility Collocated with DSS Storage Facility. If the Repair Agent
      facility is collocated with a DSS storage facility, the Principal is required to control the
      movement of unserviceable materiel from the storage facility to the repair facility.
         7.2.5.1.1. Compliant Activities.
             7.2.5.1.1.1. When the Repair Agent has the capacity to repair unserviceable
             materiel, they submit a referral order transaction with DIC A4A, fill or kill advice
             code 2J, and project code 3BB (unserviceable materiel only) to the correct D035A
             RIC through DAAS. This transaction allows the Repair Agent to pull the required
             SCC F materiel into their repair facility from the collocated storage facility. The
             Repair Agent generates the document number used in this referral order
             transaction.
                 7.2.5.1.1.1.1. The ‘A4_’ DIC prefix in the referral order is used to prevent
                 DAAS from rerouting the transaction to the service-defined SOS for the
                 requested NSN.
                 7.2.5.1.1.1.2. Advice code 2J in the referral order instructs D035A to reject
                 with a ‘CB’ status code any quantity not available for immediate release. If a
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                               343


             ‘CB’ reject occurs, D035A generates a ‘No Unserviceable Materiel Available
             to Induct at DMISA Location’ notice to alert the wholesale IM that materiel is
             not available to release to the repair facility. The wholesale IM must take
             action to relocate unserviceable materiel to the collocated storage facility
             when this occurs.
             7.2.5.1.1.1.3. Project code 3BB on the referral order instructs D035A to
             default to SCC F and to only consider SCC F assets at the collocated storage
             facility for possible release. This means that D035A currently does not
             support this process for SCCs D, E, G, J or K. For these SCCs, the wholesale
             IM must use the NEW screen to enter an ‘A0A’/‘V3’ relocation shipment
             transaction (see paragraph 13.8.6.1) to generate the required MRO
             transaction to DSS so that the Repair Agent receives the unserviceable
             materiel to be inducted into the repair process.
          7.2.5.1.1.2. If D035A shows a SCC F balance at the collocated storage facility, it
          generates the following:
             7.2.5.1.1.2.1. ‘A5A’ MRO transaction to the storage facility. This transaction
             directs the storage facility to ship the SCC F materiel to the Repair Agent’s
             repair facility and results in the following outputs:
             7.2.5.1.1.2.2. ‘DWK’ PMRD transaction and an ‘AE8’ Supply Status
             transaction with status code BA to notify the repair facility that materiel is
             inbound.
             7.2.5.1.1.2.3. ‘D7K’ issue transaction to D035J to record a ‘transfer-out’.
             The Repair Agent is not billed for the unserviceable materiel.
             7.2.5.1.1.2.4. Order synch transaction to RAMP for intransit processing.
          7.2.5.1.1.3. If the storage facility can honor the entire MRO shipment request, the
          storage facility ships the materiel to the Repair Agent’s local repair facility,
          generates a shipment confirmation ‘AR0’ transaction to D035A and generates a
          Shipment Status ‘AS8’ transaction to the repair facility. When the ‘AR0’
          transaction is posted to D035A’s records, it forwards another Order synch
          transaction to RAMP to open an intransit record.
          7.2.5.1.1.4. If the storage facility cannot honor the entire shipment request due to
          insufficient inventory balance, the storage facility performs the following actions:
             7.2.5.1.1.4.1. For any unsupported quantity, it sends a shipment denial ‘A6A’
             transaction to D035A, which ‘CB’ rejects the denied quantity on the next
             available suffix code, generates a ‘D7K’ issue reversal transaction for the
             denied quantity to D035J and builds an asset record for the denied quantity
             with a freeze code “X.” D035A also generates the ‘No Unserviceable
             Materiel Available to Induct at DMISA Location’ notice to alert the wholesale
             IM that materiel is not available to release to the repair facility. The
             wholesale IM is responsible for determining why unserviceable materiel is not
             available and must coordinate with their local D035A Site Functional OPR to
             correct the imbalance. The IM must also position materiel at the site for
344                                                       AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


                 repair action.
                 7.2.5.1.1.4.2. For any supported quantity (i.e., materiel shipped to the repair
                 facility), it sends an ‘AR0’ transaction to D035A and an ‘AS8’ transaction to
                 the repair facility. D035A posts the ‘AR0’ transaction and generates an Order
                 synch transaction to RAMP for intransit processing.
         7.2.5.1.2. Non-Compliant Activities. Because the depot maintenance systems used at
         Anniston, AL; Cherry Point, NC; Jacksonville, FL; and Albany, GA are not
         compliant with DoD DMISA policy, D035A receives neither a referral order nor a
         requisition transaction from the Repair Agent to move materiel from the collocated
         DSS. At these sites, the depot maintenance organizations are authorized to induct
         D035A owned materiel into the repair process as required. D035A has no interface
         with these depot maintenance systems, so assets in the repair process are not visible
         in D035A.
      7.2.5.2. Repair Agent Facility not collocated with DSS Storage Facility. For those
      Repair Agents not collocated with DSS, there is no need for the Repair Agent to request
      the issue of unserviceable materiel, so D035A is not involved when materiel is moved
      from a storage facility to a repair facility.
  7.2.6. Receipt of Requisitioned Unserviceable Materiel at the Repair Agent’s Repair
  Facility.
      7.2.6.1. If the Repair Agent’s repair facility is collocated with a DSS storage facility and
      has requisitioned unserviceable materiel from the Principal, when the repair facility
      receives the unserviceable materiel, it generates a ‘D6_’ receipt transaction back to
      D035A using the document number from its requisition transaction.
      7.2.6.2. D035A forwards a ‘D6K’ receipt transaction to D035J and RAMP and increases
      the unserviceable inventory balance reported at the repair facility.
      7.2.6.3. D035A also processes a ‘DRA’ Materiel Receipt Acknowledgment transaction
      to close the requisition for the unserviceable materiel and to generate an Order synch
      transaction for RAMP to use in closing the intransit.
  7.2.7. Induction of Materiel into the Repair Process.
      7.2.7.1. When the Repair Agent’s repair facility inducts the materiel into the repair
      process, the Repair Agent sends a ‘DAC’ Inter-Condition Transfer transaction to D035A.
      This transaction updates the repair facility’s asset balances in D035A to reflect the
      movement of materiel to SCC M. D035A forwards a copy of the ‘DAC’ transaction to
      D035J.
      7.2.7.2. The Repair Agent assigns the document number used on all ‘DAC’ transactions.
      The same document number must be used to track the materiel as it moves through the
      repair process (e.g., a ‘DAC’ from ‘F’ to ‘M’ followed by a ‘DAC’ from ‘M’ to ‘A’).
      The suffix code field on a ‘DAC’’ transaction must be used by the Repair Agent when the
      initial ‘DAC’ transaction to SCC M contained a quantity greater than one. For example,
      if the Repair Agent inducted a total quantity of four into repair under a document number,
      D035A receives four separate ‘DAC’ transactions with different suffix codes (e.g., ‘A’,
      ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’), each moving one asset from SCC M to SCC A.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                 345


  7.2.8. Request for Serviceable Replacement Parts by Repair Agent.
  7.2.8.1.    When the Repair Agent needs a serviceable replacement part to repair the
  Principal’s asset, they must submit a funded requisition to the service-defined ICP for the
  required NSN. If the Repair Agent’s service is not a registered user of the item, the
  requisition transaction must contain project code 3AD. This code instructs the ICP to bypass
  NSN edits against the JMC that defines which services are registered users. For D035A,
  project code 3AD ensures that the requisition will not be suspended as a “9C” controlled
  exception (non-programmed requirement). See Chapter 8.
  7.2.8.2. The wholesale IM is not authorized to free issue serviceable replacement parts to
  the Repair Agent. Any serviceable replacement parts shipped to the Repair Agent must be
  sold at standard price. The Repair Agent recoups this cost through billing the Principal for
  the repair of its asset.
  7.2.9. Repair Agent Reports Serviceable Materiel to the Principal.
     7.2.9.1. Upon receiving notification that the materiel has been repaired and is now
     serviceable (i.e., a ‘DAC’ transaction moved materiel from SCC M to SCC A), D035A
     performs the following checks:
         7.2.9.1.1. If the Repair Agent is a repair-and-return site, D035A processes the ‘DAC’
         transaction to update asset balances and to update D035J, but no attempt is made to
         automatically move the materiel. D035A expects to later receive a ‘D7_’ issue
         transaction from the Repair Agent that shows the materiel was shipped back to an AF
         depot. This ‘D7_’ transaction is used by D035A to process an ‘A0A’ requisition
         transaction with a ‘V3’ action code, which updates the asset balance, creates an open
         relocation shipment record and passes a ‘D7K’ issue transaction to D035J.
         7.2.9.1.2. If the Repair Agent is not a repair-and-return site, D035A processes the
         ‘DAC’ transaction to update asset balances and to update D035J. If the Repair Agent
         uses a local DSS facility for storage, D035A automatically sends an MRO transaction
         to the Repair Agent’s repair facility to relocate the materiel back to the DSS storage
         facility. The MRO contains a D035A wholesale document number, project code 3BB
         and the collocated DSS storage facility DoDAAC as the ship-to address. D035A
         generates a ‘DWM’ PMRD transaction to the DSS storage facility to alert them that
         materiel is inbound from a local repair facility. D035A adjusts the repair facility’s
         asset balance, forwards a ‘D7K’ issue transaction to D035J and forwards an Order
         synch transaction to RAMP for intransit tracking.
     7.2.9.2. Upon receipt of the MRO transaction from D035A, the repair facility ships the
     materiel as instructed and forwards an ‘AR0’ transaction to D035A. D035A posts the
     ‘AR0’ transaction received from the repair facility to D035A records and forwards a copy
     to RAMP for intransit processing.
     7.2.9.3. If the repaired materiel was shipped to the local DSS storage facility, it sends a
     ‘D6M’ transaction to D035A to acknowledge receipt of the materiel. When D035A
     receives the ‘D6M’ transaction, it adjusts the serviceable condition balance for the DSS
     storage facility, forwards a copy of the transaction to D035J and RAMP and posts a
     ‘DRA’ transaction to close the relocation shipment requisition.
346                                                     AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


      7.2.9.4. If D035A has visibility of assets located at the Repair Agent’s facility, the
      following rules apply concerning shipments directed by the wholesale IM via off-line
      (e.g., by telephone) instructions to the Repair Agent:
         7.2.9.4.1. The wholesale IM cannot use the direct delivery process (i.e., changing the
         BO status to ‘BV’ and inputting a ‘ZKM’ direct delivery shipment confirmation
         transaction into D035A) to show movement of materiel from the Repair Agent to fill
         BOs, because this process does not update the D035A asset balance and does not
         provide accurate information to the D035J subsystem.
         7.2.9.4.2. If the wholesale IM provides off-line shipping instructions, s/he must enter
         a degraded operations shipment (i.e., answering ‘N’ to the ‘Output MRO/RDO?’
         prompt) into D035A using a ‘V1’, ‘V3’ or ‘VD’ action code. The ‘V1’ action code is
         used if the materiel is shipped to fill a BO. The ‘V3’ action code is used if the
         materiel is relocated to depot storage. The ‘VD’ action code is used if the materiel is
         shipped to a disposal activity.
  7.2.10. Repair Agent Returns Unserviceable Materiel to the Principal.
      7.2.10.1. SCC H.
         7.2.10.1.1. Management Code ‘M’. When D035A receives a ‘DAC’ transaction
         from the repair facility showing materiel moving to SCC H, if the management code
         is ‘M’ (materiel shipped directly to disposal activity upon receipt), D035A first
         decreases the balance for SCC M and increases the balance for SCC H; then, D035A
         generates a “D7J” issue to disposal transaction using the document number from the
         ‘DAC’ transaction to decrease the SCC H balance. D035A also passes a copy of the
         ‘D7J’ transaction to D035J.
         7.2.10.1.2. Management Code Not ‘M’. When D035A receives a ‘DAC’ transaction
         from the repair facility showing materiel moving to SCC H and the management code
         is not ‘M’, D035A generates a “7I” controlled exception (DAC from DMISA Repair
         Agent management code not “M”). The wholesale IM can either delete or release the
         “7I” controlled exception as detailed in Chapter 8.
      7.2.10.2. Other Than SCC H. The Repair Agent generates a ‘DAC’ transaction back to
      D035A with an unserviceable SCC other than “H” in the “To SCC” field.
         7.2.10.2.1. Non Repair-and-Return. If the repair facility has a collocated DSS
         storage facility, D035A processes DIC A0A relocation shipment transaction with
         action code V3, a D035A wholesale document number, project code 3BB and the
         collocated DSS storage facility DoDAAC as the ship-to address. The MRO
         transaction instructs the repair facility to return unserviceable materiel back to the
         DSS storage facility.
             7.2.10.2.1.1. D035A generates a “DWM” PMRD transaction to the storage
             facility DSS to alert them that materiel is inbound. D035A adjusts the repair
             facility’s asset balance, forwards a “D7K” issue transaction to D035J and
             forwards an order synch transaction to RAMP for intransit tracking.
             7.2.10.2.1.2. Upon receipt of the MRO transaction from D035A, the repair
             facility ships the materiel to DSS and forwards DIC AR0 transaction to D035A.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                  347


            D035A posts DIC AR0 transaction received from the repair facility to D035A
            records and forwards a copy to RAMP for intransit processing.
            7.2.10.2.1.3. When the materiel is receipted into DSS, it sends a “D6M”
            transaction to D035A to acknowledge receipt of the materiel. When D035A
            receives the “D6M” transaction, it adjusts the unserviceable condition balance for
            the DSS storage facility, forwards a copy of the transaction to D035J and RAMP
            and posts a “DRA” transaction to close the forced shipment requisition.
         7.2.10.2.2. Repair-and-Return. For repair-and-return sites, the repair facility sends
         D035A a “D7B” issue transaction to indicate that materiel is to automatically be
         returned to an AF depot.
            7.2.10.2.2.1. D035A generates a ‘DWK’ transaction to the storage facility DSS to
            alert them that materiel is inbound. D035A adjusts the repair facility’s asset
            balance, forwards a ‘D7K’ issue transaction to D035J and forwards an order
            synch transaction to RAMP for intransit tracking.
            7.2.10.2.2.2. When the materiel is received by DSS, it sends a ‘D6M’ transaction
            to D035A to acknowledge receipt of the materiel. When D035A receives the
            ‘D6M’ transaction, it adjusts the unserviceable condition balance for the DSS
            storage facility, forwards a copy of the transaction to D035J and RAMP and posts
            a ‘DRA’ transaction to close the forced shipment requisition.
  7.2.11. Disposal of Condemned Materiel by a Repair Activity.
     7.2.11.1. For assets being repaired under a DMISA, it is common for the repair activity
     to have authority to automatically ship condemned assets to DLA Disposition Services.
     There are three different transactions that may be sent by the repair activity to D035A to
     indicate a shipment of condemned materiel to disposal.
         7.2.11.1.1. The repair activity may send D035A a ‘D7J’ Issue to Disposal
         transaction. If the repair activity’s RIC is identified as a valid DMISA RIC, D035A
         will process the ‘D7J’ transaction as if the IM input a disposal requisition transaction
         through the D035A NEW screen.
         7.2.11.1.2. The repair activity may send D035A an Inter-Condition Transfer (DIC
         ‘DAC’) transaction with a ‘To’ SCC equal to “H”’ and with a management code
         equal to ‘M’. In this situation, D035A automatically generates its own ‘D7J’
         transaction to immediately drop the SCC H balance.
            7.2.11.1.2.1. D035A forwards a copy of both the ‘DAC’ transaction and the
            ‘D7J’ transaction to D035J for processing the following day.
            7.2.11.1.2.2. For ERRC “T” items, D035A uses the ‘D7J’ transaction to update
            the shipment to DLA Disposition Services quantity for the quarterly SB&CR
            processes.
            7.2.11.1.2.3. For equipment ERRC “S” or “U” items, D035A transmits the
            ‘DAC’ and ‘D7J’ transactions to AFEMS at EOD.
         7.2.11.1.3. The repair activity may send D035A a Turn-In Receipt (DIC ‘D6M’)
         transaction with a SCC H and with a management code M or T. In this situation,
 348                                                       AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


          D035A automatically generates its own ‘D7J’ transaction to immediately drop the
          SCC H balance.
              7.2.11.1.3.1. D035A sends a copy of both the ‘D6M’ and ‘D7J’ transactions to
              D035J for processing the following day.
              7.2.11.1.3.2. For recoverable ERRC “T” items, D035A uses the ‘D7J’ transaction
              to update the shipment to DLA Disposition Services quantity for the quarterly
              SB&CR processes.
              7.2.11.1.3.3. For equipment ERRC “S” or “U” items, D035A transmits the D6M
              and ‘D7J’ transactions are to AFEMS at EOD.
       7.2.11.2. For assets being repaired at Hill, Robins and Tinker depot, D035K is
       responsible for directing the shipment of condemned assets to DLA Disposition Services.
       The only visibility of these actions in D035A is through the EOD asset overlay process
       described in Chapter 5.
          7.2.11.2.1. A SCC 2 balance in O/P ‘9’ as seen on the D035A NSNC screen is a
          condemned asset that will be turned in by a maintenance shop.
          7.2.11.2.2. When the condemned asset is turned in, it will be shipped to DLA
          Disposition Services. D035K is responsible for recording these actions to retail
          transaction history, for sending the appropriate transactions to D035J and for sending
          the appropriate transactions to RAMP for quarterly SB&CR processing.
7.3. Contractor Repair.
   7.3.1. Introduction. Contract repair is governed by a binding agreement between the
   government and a commercial contractor provider of maintenance services. The following
   details contract repair-related processes used to provide the AF wholesale IM with visibility
   of their end items located at the contractor repair facility.
       7.3.1.1. Contract repair information in this chapter focuses on D035A processing of
       transactions for end items in repair as reported by the Commercial Asset Visibility
       (CAV) system. Because CAV does not perform required financial accounting these
       items, an interface was developed to allow for financial reporting through D035A to
       D035J.
          7.3.1.1.1. CAV allows an AF IM to track assets as they flow through the repair cycle
          and to track intransit materiel to and from the contractor’s repair facility. The
          contractor is responsible for entering data into CAV on a daily basis to show receipt
          of materiel at their facility, to show issue of materiel to their maintenance activity, to
          show turn-in of materiel from their maintenance activity and to show shipment of
          materiel from their facility. As part of the EOD process, CAV produces a data file
          that shows all this activity by contract.
          7.3.1.1.2. On all new repair contracts that allow for GFM, CAV is used by the
          contractor to requisition GFM from the appropriate DoD ICP. In this situation, CAV
          replaces SSSC as the Management Control Activity (MCA) for requisition validation.
          Financial reporting of GFM (i.e., receipts of GFM at the contractor’s facility and
          issues of GFM to the maintenance activity) is accomplished through an SBSS
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                 349


         account. D035A is not involved with this process other than reporting a transfer out
         of materiel from D035A ownership to fill a GFM requisition.
     7.3.1.2. To create an interface from the single CAV system to the three D035A
     mainframe systems, additional software was developed by AF. This software plus the
     CAV software are referred to as CAV Air Force (CAV-AF). The ICD that defines the
     CAV-AF initiated transactions received by D035A cites CAV-AF as the sending system.
         7.3.1.2.1. Transactions created by CAV-AF at EOD are not 80-rp Military Standard
         (MILS) formatted transactions; so, an additional Enterprise Application Integration
         (EAI) process is used to reformat the data into MILS transactions that can be
         successfully processed by D035A. References in this volume will consider this EAI
         software to be part of CAV-AF.
         7.3.1.2.2. In some cases, CAV-AF creates additional MILS transactions for D035A:
            7.3.1.2.2.1. For a ‘D6_’ receipt transaction with a quantity greater than one,
            CAV-AF creates multiple ‘D6M’ receipt transactions for D035A, each with a
            quantity of one. Note: It has since been determined that this is no longer
            required by D035A but that the CAV-AF EAI software which governs this
            process cannot be changed to halt the transaction breakout. D035A consolidates
            these individual transactions into a single transaction for processing.
            7.3.1.2.2.2. For a ‘D7_’ issue transaction that indicates a shipment to fill an open
            BO, CAV-AF also creates a ‘ZKM’ DVD Shipment Status transaction for
            D035A.
            7.3.1.2.2.3. For a ‘D7_’ issue transaction that indicates a shipment to a depot
            storage facility, CAV-AF creates a ‘DFM’ DIFM transaction for D035A.
            7.3.1.2.2.4. For a ‘DAC’ transaction that indicates a NIIN change, CAV-AF also
            creates both a ‘D8J’ Re-identification Gain transaction and a ‘D9J’ Re-
            identification Loss transaction for D035A.
         7.3.1.2.3. The MILS transactions created by CAV-AF are routed to SCS Midtier,
         which uses the NIIN on each transaction to retrieve a master catalog record. The
         FSC, MMAC and AF ICP RIC values from the master catalog record are inserted into
         the MILS transaction, which is then routed to the appropriate D035A mainframe
         system.
     7.3.1.3. D035A routes transactions outbound to CAV-AF via DAAS. The inclusion of
     distribution code ‘C’ in AF repair contractor GFM transactions signals DAAS to route
     ‘AX1’ GFM Validation Request, ‘AE3’ Supply Status, ‘AS3’ Shipment Status and
     ‘AN3’ MOV Request transactions to CAV-AF. There is no automated method for
     D035A to send CAV-AF any other type transactions (e.g., ‘A5_’ MRO and ‘AC6’
     Shipment Cancellation); therefore, D035A does not consider CAV-AF reported asset
     balances when attempting to automatically fill a customer requisition.
  7.3.2. Establishing a Repair Contractor Activity Within D035A.
     7.3.2.1. For a CAV-AF transaction to process successfully within D035A, the
     contractor’s DoDAAC and RIC must be recognized by D035A. The AF DoDAAC
     Service Point Manager is responsible for assigning a unique DoDAAC/RIC combination
350                                                    AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


      to a contractor facility using the DoDAAC Web Management System, which also
      provides a query capability to search for contractor DoDAAC/RIC information. Updates
      made in this web application are automatically provided without the contractor’s RIC to
      D035T which maintains a DoDAAC database visible to D035A.
         7.3.2.1.1. D035A transaction logic assumes the DoDAAC assigned to a contractor
         facility utilizing CAV-AF begins with ‘EZ’ and the assigned RIC begins with ‘E’. If
         other values are used, D035A logic will not work as designed. Notify the AF
         DoDAAC Service Point Manager when an invalid CAV-AFDODAAC/RIC
         combination is discovered.
         7.3.2.1.2. The AF DoDAAC Service Point Manager will contact the D035A AFMC
         Lead Functional OPR when adding or changing CAV-AF DoDAAC/RIC data so that
         the appropriate database records are file maintained in D035A before CAV-AF
         reporting begins for the new DoDAAC/RIC combination. If these database records
         are not properly file maintained, D035A could receive a CAV-AF transaction with an
         unknown contractor RIC. D035A suspends this type transaction as a “1F” controlled
         exception (Invalid Site R/I). See Chapter 8 for further details.
      7.3.2.2. The following three databases used by D035A when validating DoDAAC and
      RIC data contained in a CAV-AF transaction:
         7.3.2.2.1. SCD-DODAAC-REC. D035A uses this D035T-maintained database to
         validate the DoDAAC value found in the document number and SUPADD fields of a
         MILS transaction. If the DoDAAC in the document number field is not found,
         D035A suspends the transaction as a “3X” controlled exception (Invalid DoDAAC).
         If the DoDAAC in the SUPADD field is not found, D035A suspends the transaction
         as a “6E” controlled exception (Check SUPADD). See Chapter 8 for further details.
         Note: Even if the DoDAAC is valid per the DAASINQ website, the “3X” or “6E”
         controlled exception cannot be cleared until the missing DoDAAC has been added to
         the DoDAAC Web Management System and a DoDAAC add transaction has been
         processed by D035T.
         7.3.2.2.2. SCD-TAB24-REC. D035A uses this database to convert a DoDAAC into
         a RIC. This database is required because the RIC field found on the SCD-DODAAC-
         REC database contains no data for an ‘EZ’ DoDAAC. No controlled exception is
         created if the system cannot perform a DoDAAC-to-RIC conversion; but, if a ship-to
         DoDAAC cannot be converted into a ship-to RIC, D035A outputs no PMRD
         transaction. Modification of SCS Midtier Organization data in-turn updates the SCD-
         TAB24-REC (see paragraph 13.18.8).
         7.3.2.2.3. SCD-TAB35-REC. D035A uses this database to validate the RIC value
         found in the Storage Activity field of a MILS transaction. If the RIC is not found,
         D035A suspends the transaction as a ‘1F’ controlled exception, which cannot be
         cleared until the D035A AFMC Lead Functional OPR adds the missing RIC through
         the SCS Storage Organization table (see paragraph 13.20.20). Modification of this
         table in-turn updates the SCD-TAB35-REC.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                 351


  7.3.3. Relocating Unserviceable End Items to a Repair Contractor Activity.
     7.3.3.1. There are three common methods for relocating unserviceable (SCC F) end
     items to a contractor’s repair facility, which must be identified through a valid ‘EZ’
     DoDAAC.
         7.3.3.1.1. The IM can use RAMP RIMCS to instruct an SBSS account to
         automatically ship a SCC F asset turned in to base supply to the contractor’s repair
         facility. If RIMCS data does not direct a shipment, the SCC F asset is stored by base
         supply and reported at end of day to RAMP. Refer to Chapter 6 for details
         concerning RAMP processes.
            7.3.3.1.1.1. SBSS reports a RIMCS-directed shipment to RAMP on a ‘D7M’
            issue transaction which it uses to create a PMRD ‘DWM’ transaction. RAMP
            uses the ‘D7M’ transaction to create an intransit going to the contractor’s
            DoDAAC. Because no interface exists for the transmission of the ‘DWM’
            transaction to CAV-AF, the contractor does not receive notification of the
            shipment in-bound to their facility. Both the ‘D7M’ and ‘DWM’ transactions are
            recorded on D035A Daily Transaction History.
            7.3.3.1.1.2. For SCC F materiel stored by base supply and reported by SBSS to
            RAMP, a batch process eventually creates an ‘A2_’ RDO transaction that directs
            SBSS to ship the materiel back to the local depot storage facility.
         7.3.3.1.2. When a SC F asset is turned into depot supply, the RIMCS ship-to
         DoDAAC is visible to D035K; however, the NSN Maintenance Repair Code must
         also be set to either ‘G’ or ‘H’ to instruct D035K to automatically ship the SCC F
         asset to the contractor’s repair facility. If D035K does not direct a shipment, the SCC
         F asset is binned and reported at EOD to D035A on a ‘XBD’ Asset Overlay
         transaction. See Chapter 5 for information regarding the D035K-to-D035A asset
         overlay process.
            7.3.3.1.2.1. D035K Lead and Site Functional OPRs can use the file maintenance
            (FMML) menu to maintain the ‘Maintenance Repair Code’ value assigned to an
            NSN.
            7.3.3.1.2.2. D035K records a RIMCS and ‘Maintenance Repair Code’ directed
            shipment on Retail Transaction History as an ‘Y5A’ Automatic Shipment
            transaction. At EOD, the ‘Y5A’ transaction is used to create and send an ‘X2A’
            Notice of Shipment transaction to RAMP. RAMP uses the ‘X2A’ transaction to
            create an intransit going to the contractor’s DoDAAC.
         7.3.3.1.3. Wholesale IMs can use the D035A NEW screen to manually generate a
         shipping request to relocate SCC F materiel to the contractor’s repair facility from
         SBSS, D035K and non-AF depot locations. See paragraph 13.8.6 for asset
         relocation using a ‘V3’ action code and an ‘H’ management code.
     7.3.3.2. Regardless of which method is used to relocate unserviceable materiel to a repair
     contractor facility, the financial impact of this movement is simply a transfer-out. There
     is no billing; however, financial accounting requires a corresponding transfer-in
352                                                     AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


      transaction be recorded when the materiel is received by the contractor. This transfer-in
      is initiated by CAV-AF receipt process as described in paragraph 7.3.5.
      7.3.3.3. The IM must work with the PMS to determine the best method for relocating
      unserviceable materiel to the contractor’s repair facility. The contractor may have
      storage space limitations or the contract may specify a specific number of assets to be
      repaired for a given month or quarter. Because D035A cannot successfully send a
      shipping request transaction to CAV-AF, the IM may want to avoid storing large
      numbers of assets at the contractor’s site. For example, because an ‘A5J’ DRO
      transaction cannot be sent to CAV-AF, an off-line shipping request would have to be
      used to return the excess materiel to the local depot for later disposal processing.
  7.3.4. Relocating GFM to a Repair Contractor Activity.
      7.3.4.1. As per DLM 4000.25-1, Chapter 11, all GFM requisitions must be submitted by
      the contractor to an MCA. For a contractor utilizing CAV-AF for CDM reporting, the
      GFM requisition must be entered into CAV-AF to establish a GFM due-in record within
      that system. If the requisition data entered passes CAV-AF GFM edits, it sends an ‘A0_’
      Requisition through DAAS to the appropriate ICP RIC.
         7.3.4.1.1. GFM requisitions received by D035A are validated as detailed in Chapter
         3. If a CAV-AF generated GFM requisition does not pass the following additional
         D035A rejects it with status code CM:
             7.3.4.1.1.1. Signal code must be ‘C’ or ‘L’. This field is used to determine the
             ship-to and bill-to organizations.
             7.3.4.1.1.2. Distribution C code must be ‘C’. DAAS uses this code and the first
             rp of the document number to route MILS transactions. The combination of
             distribution code ‘C’ and document number beginning with ‘E’ has been assigned
             for CAV-AF use.
             7.3.4.1.1.3. Fund Code must be ‘GD’, ‘HD’ or ‘LD’. The first rp indicates which
             AFMC ICP manages the repair contract. Use of one of these three values
             identifies to D035A and D035J a transfer-out of GFM to CAV-AF. If a CDMAG
             value (i.e., ‘GR’, ‘HR’ or ‘LR’) is mistakenly used by the contractor, D035A
             rejects the requisition with status code FE.
         7.3.4.1.2. D035A edits against RDD and priority designator in CAV-AF initiated
         GFM requisitions are no different than for GFM requisitions processed through SSSC
         as the MCA; however, because they are used by D035A to determine if a requisition
         is a MICAP, edits for these two data elements are explained below:
             7.3.4.1.2.1. The RDD usually contains a numeric value from ‘001’ to ‘366’ that
             identifies the Julian day of the year that the materiel is required; however, to
             indicate a MICAP requisition, a customer can instead use ‘999’ or ‘N01’ through
             ‘N99’. For D035A to accept a MICAP RDD value for a GFM requisition, the
             DoDAAC in the document number field must be loaded on the SCS Midtier
             ‘Contractor Authorized MICAP’ table. If no record is found, D035A uses the
             current Julian day plus one as the RDD. This means the requisition is no longer
             considered a MICAP by D035A.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                353


          7.3.4.1.2.2. The priority designator must be between “01” and “15.” If a
          requisition contains any other value, D035A inserts a value of “15.” If the
          priority designator contains a numeric value greater than “03,” but the RDD field
          equals “999,” then D035A uses the current Julian day plus one as the RDD. If the
          priority code field contains a numeric value greater than “08,” but the RDD field
          equals “N01” through “N99,” then D035A uses the current Julian day plus one as
          the RDD. If the MICAP RDD field is replaced, the requisition is no longer
          considered a MICAP by D035A.
       7.3.4.1.3. D035A suspends on type “34” controlled exception those requisitions
       passing the initial validation process. It also sends DICs AX1 and AE8 with status
       code BD to DAAS.
          7.3.4.1.3.1. DAAS delivers DIC AX1 to CAV-AF for MCA validation. The RIC
          in rp 74-76 of DIC A0_ is copied into DIC AX1; however, that value (CAV-AF
          uses “FC2”) is not required for DAAS routing.
          7.3.4.1.3.2. DAAS converts DIC AE8 into DIC AE3 and delivers it to CAV-AF
          to provide the requisitioner with updated supply status.
       7.3.4.1.3.3. The suspended GFM requisition is visible on the D035A DODA screen;
       but, the type “34” controlled exception is not visible on the D035A CEX screen.
       7.3.4.1.4. CAV-AF receives DIC AX1 and performs a second MCA validation (the
       first occurring upon contractor input of the original requisition directly in CAV-AF).
       This step is required to allow for CAV-AF reject of any GFM requisition sent by a
       contractor directly to an ICP RIC. Based on the result of the validation process,
       CAV-AF sends DIC AX2 GFM Validation Response transaction through DAAS to
       the ICP RIC.
       7.3.4.1.5. If D035A does not receive DIC AX2 from the MCA within 15 calendar
       days, it rejects the requisition with status code DR.
       7.3.4.1.6. If D035A does receive DIC AX2, it first deletes the matching “34”
       controlled exception and then uses the value in the advice code to determine follow-
       on action:
          7.3.4.1.6.1. 2M – the requisition is processed for possible release of assets.
          7.3.4.1.6.2. 2Q – the requisition is rejected with status code DQ.
          7.3.4.1.6.3. 2R – the quantity not authorized (the original ordered quantity minus
          the quantity from DIC AX2) is rejected with status code DJ. On the next
          available suffix code, the authorized quantity is processed for possible release of
          assets.
          7.3.4.1.6.4. 2U – the requisition is rejected with status code DB.
          7.3.4.1.6.5. 2V – the requisition is rejected with status code DN.
       7.3.4.1.7. If the requisition successfully passed the “AX1”/”AX2” GFM validation
       process, it is treated like any other non-loan requisition as detailed in Chapter 3. For
       example, if the GFM requisition is for a consumable item, the requisitioned quantity
       is counted as a demand for the ordered NSN.
354                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


      7.3.4.2. The D035A NEW screen does not allow direct entry of a GFM requisition into
      D035A. Force shipment of a serviceable asset to a contractor facility using an ‘FD’
      document number is not authorized even if the shipment is to support a MICAP GFM
      requirement. The GFM validation process must be followed when providing government
      owned materiel at no cost to a contractor. The only alternative to this rule is for the
      contractor to submit a Contractor Furnished Materiel (CFM) requisition to D035A.
      When using a CFM requisition (identified by the use of the ‘XP’ Fund Code and a
      billable signal code), the contractor is billed for the government-owned materiel
      provided. This cost is then passed on to the government as part of the repair cost.
  7.3.5. Receipt Processing at a Repair Contractor Activity.
      7.3.5.1. When a shipment of unserviceable materiel is received at the contractor’s
      facility, the contractor is required to enter a receipt transaction into CAV-AF in a timely
      manner using the document number from the shipment paperwork. If the contractor can
      successfully tie the receipt to an active repair contract, CAV-AF receipt assigns SCC F;
      otherwise, CAF-AF assigns SCC J. As part of an EOD process, CAV-AF generates a
      400-rp ‘D6A’ transaction for every receipt transaction entered by the contractor since the
      last EOD run.
         7.3.5.1.1. As part of the CAV-AF process, each 400-rp ‘D6A’ transaction is
         translated into an 80-rp MILS formatted ‘D6M’ transaction with a quantity value of
         ‘00001’. DAAS routes these receipt transactions are routed through the SCS Midtier
         to the appropriate D035A.
         7.3.5.1.2. When D035A receives a ‘D6M’ transaction through the CAV-AF
         interface, it places an ‘H’ in the management code to indicate a receipt against a
         relocation shipment. See Chapter 5 for D035A receipt procedures. The following
         key receipt transactions are recorded by D035A:
             7.3.5.1.2.1. A ‘D6M’ transaction is written to the Accountable Transaction
             History database for D035J. D035A uses the ‘D6M’ transaction to increase the
             value of the on-hand inventory and transfer in accounts. Use the D035A DODF
             screen to view accountable transactions.
             7.3.5.1.2.2. A ‘D6M’ transaction is also written to a RAMP Intransit Interface
             record. RAMP uses this transaction to close an intransit record created by a
             RIMCS-directed shipment from D035K or SBSS. For this process to work, the
             contractor must have entered the correct ‘FB’ issue document number into CAV-
             AF when posting the receipt.
             7.3.5.1.2.3. For a ‘D6M’ transaction with an ‘FD’ document number, RAMP
             records a ‘DRA’ transaction to the release order database and closes an intransit
             record created by a relocation shipment initiated from the D035A NEW screen.
             For this process to work, the contractor must have entered the correct ‘FD’ issue
             document number into CAV-AF when posting the receipt.
         7.3.5.1.3. Use the D035A NSNC screen to view CAV-AF asset balances. CAV-AF
         reported assets are displayed with a storage RIC beginning with “E.”
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                   355


     7.3.5.2. When a shipment of serviceable materiel is received at the contractor’s facility,
     the contractor is also required to enter a receipt transaction into CAV-AF in a timely
     manner using the document number from the shipment paperwork. The materiel may or
     may not be GFM.
         7.3.5.2.1. If the receipt document number is matched to a GFM requisition due-in
         record, CAV-AF sends a ‘DRA’ transaction to the ICP RIC through DAAS. The ICP
         uses the ‘DRA’ transaction to close its GFM requisition record. See paragraph
         3.4.3.3 for a complete description of the D035A MRA process. CAV-AF does
         generate a GFM receipt transaction; however, the EAI process does not create a
         MILS formatted ‘D6H’ transaction for D035A. Instead, it creates and passes an
         SBSS transaction to the unique SBSS domain maintained specifically to handle CAV-
         AF GFM requisitions.
         7.3.5.2.2. If the receipt document number is not matched to a GFM requisition due-in
         record, the CAV-AF process is similar to that for the receipt of unserviceable
         materiel; however, the EAI process does not translate the 400-rp ‘D6A’ transaction
         into an 80-rp ‘D6M’ transaction for D035A. Therefore, D035A and D035J in-turn do
         not have visibility of serviceable materiel moved to a contractor’s facility for storage.
     7.3.5.3. If the contractor wishes to correct receipt transaction data entered into CAV-AF
     in error, the original receipt transaction may be reversed and a corrected receipt
     transaction may then be entered. The CAV-AF EOD process generates one or more 400-
     rp ‘D6A’ reversal transactions and one or more 400-rp ‘D6M’ reversal transactions. The
     CAV-AF process also translates a ‘D6A’ reversal transaction into an 80-rp MILS
     formatted ‘D6M’ reversal transaction for D035A. For materiel receipted into SCC J, it is
     usual for the contractor to reverse the original receipt and to post another receipt against
     the correct contract. See Chapter 5 for a description of the D035A receipt reversal
     process.
  7.3.6. Inducting Unserviceable Materiel into Maintenance at a Repair Contractor Activity.
     7.3.6.1. When an asset is inducted into the repair process at the contractor’s facility, the
     contractor is required to enter the appropriate induction transaction in a timely manner
     into CAV-AF. The CAV-AF EOD process generates a 400-rp ‘DAC’ Inter-condition
     Transfer transaction using the unique “EZ” document number assigned by CAV-AF to
     the asset on receipt and a “To” SCC of “M.” The “From” SCC can be A, F, G, H or J.
     7.3.6.2. As part of the CAV-AF process, the 400-rp ‘DAC’ transaction is translated into
     an 80-rp MILS formatted ‘DAC’ transaction and routed via DAAS through the SCS
     Midtier to D035A. When D035A receives a ‘DAC’ transaction through the CAV-AF
     interface, the normal inter-condition transfer process described in Chapter 5 is followed
     to post the SCC change to D035A’s records with one exception: if the “From SCC” is H
     or J, D035A first processes a ‘D8J’ Re-identification Gain transaction using the “From
     SCC” to create a SCC H or J asset balance record. This is necessary because D035A
     often does not have a CAV-AF asset balance record for these two SCCs.
     7.3.6.3. If the contractor wishes to correct ‘DAC’ transaction data entered into CAV-AF,
     the original ‘DAC’ transaction can be reversed in CAV-AF. When the CAV-AF process
     creates the 80-rp MILS ‘DAC’ transaction from the 400-rp CAV-AF ‘DAC’ reversal
356                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


      transaction, the “To” and “From” SCCs are switched, because D035A does not have a
      ‘DAC’ reversal process.
  7.3.7. Turning in Materiel from Maintenance at a Repair Contractor Activity.
      7.3.7.1. When a component part is turned in from the contractor’s repair line, the
      contractor is required to enter a receipt transaction in a timely manner into CAV-AF. The
      CAV-AF EOD process generates a 400-rp ‘D6X’ receipt transaction for this turn-in. As
      part of the CAV-AF process, the 400-rp ‘D6X’ transaction is translated into an 80-rp
      MILS formatted ‘D6K’ transaction for D035A (SCC F) or into a turn-in transaction for
      SBSS (SCC A). The ‘D6K’ transaction sent to D035A contains a Purpose Code ‘H’. See
      Chapter 5 for the non-procurement receipt process followed to post the ‘D6K’ receipt to
      D035A’s records.
      7.3.7.2. When an end item undergoing repair is turned in from the contractor’s repair
      line, the contractor is required to enter an inter-condition transfer transaction into CAV-
      AF with a “From SCC” of “M.” The CAV-AF EOD process generates a 400-rp ‘DAC’
      transaction. As part of the CAV-AF process, the 400-rp ‘DAC’ transaction is translated
      into an 80-rp MILS formatted ‘DAC’ transaction for D035A. If a NIIN change occurred
      during the repair process, CAV-AF creates and sends D035A both a ‘D8J’ Re-
      identification Gain transaction and a ‘D9J’ Re-identification Loss transaction. See
      Chapter 5 for the normal inter-condition transfer process followed to post the SCC
      change to D035A’s records.
         7.3.7.2.1. If the asset was successfully repaired by the contractor, the “To SCC” in
         the ‘DAC’ transaction will equal “A.” When this occurs, D035A processes a RBO
         transaction in an attempt to use the SCC A asset to fill a BO. Because there is no
         automated method for sending an ‘A5_’ MRO transaction to CAV-AF, it is important
         that D035A does not try to release the asset for shipment. This is accomplished
         through the assignment of a blank Geographic Area Code value to the contractor’s
         storage activity RIC (see paragraph 13.22.20.3).
         7.3.7.2.2. If the asset was not successfully repair by the contractor, the “To SCC” on
         the ‘DAC’ transaction will equal either “F” or “‘G.” Because CAV-AF is responsible
         for computing the repair cycle time for a NSN, the ‘DAC’ transaction is not passed by
         D035A to RAMP.
         7.3.7.2.3. If the asset was condemned by the contractor, the “To SCC” in the ‘DAC’
         transaction will equal “H.” Because the EAI conversion process inserted an ‘M’ into
         the management code of the ‘DAC’ transaction, D035A automatically processes a
         ‘D7J’ Issue to Disposal transaction. It is for this reason that D035A does not
         maintain a SCC H balance for condemned materiel stored at the contractor’s facility.
      7.3.7.3. If the contractor wishes to correct ‘DAC’ transaction data entered into CAV-AF,
      the original ‘DAC’ transaction can be reversed in CAV-AF as described in paragraph
      7.3.6.3; however, for a ‘DAC’ reversal transaction that moves an asset from SCC H back
      to SCC M, the ‘D7J’ transaction is not reversed. Instead, a ‘D8J’ transaction is processed
      to create a SCC H asset balance record so that the ‘DAC’ transaction can successfully
      process.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                  357


  7.3.8. Returning Materiel from a Repair Contractor Activity.
     7.3.8.1. When a component part is shipped from the contractor’s facility, the contractor
     is required to enter an issue transaction in a timely manner into CAV-AF. The CAV-AF
     EOD process generates a 400-rp ‘D7X’ issue transaction for this shipment. As part of the
     CAV-AF process, the 400-rp ‘D7X’ transaction is translated into an 80-rp MILS
     formatted ‘D7K’ transaction for D035A along with an 80-rp MILS formatted ‘DFM’
     transaction, both with purpose code H.
     7.3.8.2. When an end item is shipped from the contractor’s facility, the contractor is
     required to enter an issue transaction in a timely manner into CAV-AF. The CAV-AF
     EOD process generates a 400-rp “D7X” issue transaction for this shipment. As part of
     the CAV-AF process, the 400-rp “D7X” transaction is translated into an 80-rp MILS
     formatted “D7M” transaction for D035A along with either an 80-rp MILS formatted
     “DFM” transaction or an 80-rp “ZKM” transaction. A “DFM” transaction is sent if the
     “D7M” document number begins with “FD” or it contains the contractor’s DoDAAC;
     otherwise, a “ZK”’ transaction is sent.
     7.3.8.3. When D035A receives a “D7K” or “D7M” transaction through the CAV-
     AF/D035A interface, the transaction is recorded to the D035A Daily Transaction History
     database and the following edits performed (see Chapter 8 for controlled exception
     processing).
         7.3.8.3.1. If the NSN on the transaction is not valid, the transaction is suspended as a
         “3A” controlled exception.
         7.3.8.3.2. If the document number field does not contain a valid DoDAAC, the
         transaction is suspended as a “3X” controlled exception.
         7.3.8.3.3. If the document number field does not contain a valid Julian date value, the
         transaction is suspended as a “1N” controlled exception.
         7.3.8.3.4. If the Quantity field does not contain a numeric value, the transaction is
         suspended as a “1U” controlled exception.
         7.3.8.3.5. If the UI field does not contain the correct value, the transaction is
         suspended as a “4S” controlled exception.
         7.3.8.3.6. The document number is used to search for a matching D035A document
         record.
             7.3.8.3.6.1. If a matching requisition is found but it does not have status code BA,
             BB, B4, B5, BV, or BZ, the transaction is suspended as a “4N” controlled
             exception.
             7.3.8.3.6.2. If a matching requisition is found and has status code BA, no further
             processing takes place under the assumption that the shipment was already
             entered manually into D035A.
             7.3.8.3.6.3. If no matching document record is found, a document, requisition and
             release order structure are created to show a confirmed shipment. On the
             document record, the project code is set to “CAV.” On the requisition record, the
             status code is set to “BA” and the Quantity Open is set to zero. On the release
358                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


             order record, the Transportation Control Number (TCN) is set to
             ‘CAVD7SHIPMENTXXXX’. Use the D035A DODA screen to view this data.
             7.3.8.3.6.4. For a ‘D7K’ transaction, if a matching document record was found in
             a BO status, the requisition data in D035A is updated to show a lateral support
             shipment from a contractor. On the Document record, the Date Last Action is set
             to the current processing date. On the requisition record, the status code is
             changed to “BA.” A release order record is created with the TCN set to
             ‘CAVD7SHIPMENTXXXX’. The BO record is deleted.
         7.3.8.3.7. The NSN, SCC, purpose code and storage RIC are used to search for a
         matching D035A Total Asset record. If no matching record is found, the transaction
         is suspended as a “3H” controlled exception. If a matching record is found, but the
         quantity on the “D7_” transaction is greater than the on-hand balance in D035A, the
         transaction is also suspended as a “3H” controlled exception. If the transaction is not
         suspended, the matching Total Asset record is updated by subtracting the "D7_”
         quantity from the Total Asset on-hand balance and a “D7M” transaction is written to
         Accountable Transaction History for D035J. If the updated Total Asset record has an
         on-hand balance equal to zero, the record is deleted.
      7.3.8.4. When D035A receives a ‘DFM’ transaction through the CAV-AF/D035A
      interface, the data is used to create a ‘DWM’ PMRD transaction for the receiving
      organization. The DoDAAC in the SUPADD is converted into a Storage RIC using the
      SCD-TAB24-REC database. The ‘DWM’ transaction is recorded to the D035A Daily
      Transaction History database; however, it is only sent to DAAS for routing to the Storage
      RIC if the RIC identifies a valid Storage Organization (i.e., the value is found on the
      SCD-TAB35-REC database or the value is a D035K RIC or the collocated DSS RIC).
      7.3.8.5. When D035A receives a “ZKM” transaction through the CAV-AF/D035A
      interface, the process described in Chapter 3 is followed. The assumption made when
      developing the CAV-AF/D035A interface was that the Wholesale IM would assign status
      code BV or BZ before providing the shipping details to the repair contractor. A “ZKM”
      transaction is suspended as a “4N” controlled exception if it cannot be matched to a BO
      with status code BV or BZ.
      7.3.8.6. If the contractor wishes to correct issue transaction data entered into CAV-AF,
      the original “D7A” transaction can be reversed in CAV-AF. D035A will receive a MILS
      formatted “D7K” or “D7M” reversal transaction through the CAV-AF interface when
      this occurs. D035A records the transaction to the D035A Daily Transaction History
      database and if the NSN on the transaction is not valid, the transaction is suspended as a
      “3A” controlled exception. The document number/suffix code is used to search for a
      matching D035A release order record and then the following steps are performed:
         7.3.8.6.1. If a release order record is found with DIC AR0 and a TCN
         “CAVD7SHIPMENTXXXX,” D035A attempts to create a new requisition record
         with status code BQ on suffix code A. If a Requisition record on suffix code A
         already existed, the transaction is suspended as a “4N” controlled exception;
         otherwise, the release order record is updated to contain DIC ‘RSC’ and a new release
         order record is created that contains DIC ‘AG6’.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                359


          7.3.8.6.2. If a release order record is found with a DIC ‘ZKM’, D035A processes a
          ‘ZKM’ reversal transaction. The confirmed shipment reversal process described in
          Chapter 3 is followed to post the ‘D6K’ receipt to D035A’s records.
          7.3.8.6.3. If no release order record is found that meets the above criteria, the
          transaction is suspended as a “4H” controlled exception.
          7.3.8.6.4. If the ‘D7_’ reversal transaction was not suspended, the NSN, SCC,
          purpose code and storage RIC are used to search for a matching D035A Total Asset
          record. If no matching record is found, one is created using the transaction data;
          otherwise, the matching Total Asset record is updated by adding the ‘D7_’ reversal
          quantity from the Total Asset on-hand balance. The ‘D7M’ reversal transaction is
          written to Accountable Transaction History for D035J.
   7.3.9. Reporting Asset Balances for Materiel at a Repair Contractor Activity.
      7.3.9.1. As part of the CAV-AF EOD process, CAV-AF generates a 400-rp ‘DZA’
      transaction for every NSN that had an asset balance change since the last EOD run.
      These’ DZA’ transactions contain the following asset balances with SCCs: A, F, G, H, J
      and M. If an asset balance has a value greater than zero, CAV-AF creates and sends to
      D035A an 80-rp MILS formatted ‘DZA’ transaction; however, because there are two
      SCC A fields, the SCC A (from receipt) field is not used by the CAV-AF process.
      7.3.9.2. When D035A receives a ‘DZA’ transaction through the CAV-AF interface,
      D035A writes it to Daily Transaction History database. This database is copied to the
      SCS Midtier making them viewable on the Wholesale Transaction History report.
      D035A uses the NSN, SCC and storage RIC from the ‘DZA’ transaction in an attempt to
      find a matching D035A Total Asset record. If one is found, the On-hand Balance value is
      compared to the ‘DZA’ transaction Quantity. If these two values do not match, a notice
      titled ‘Asset Balance Transaction Mismatch with On-hand Assets’ is created sent to the
      IM.
      7.3.9.3. The ‘DZA’ process is not used to report GFM asset balances to D035A.
7.4. Depot Organic Repair.
   7.4.1. Depot organic repair is governed by periodic negotiations between AF wholesale
   supply and depot maintenance organizations.
   7.4.2. The following details depot organic repair-related processes used to provide the AF
   wholesale IM with visibility of their end items located within or intransit from/to AF depot
   maintenance facilities.
      7.4.2.1. As an asset flows through the depot organic repair process, its SCC (visible on
      the NSNC screen) changes via a series of DIC ‘DAC’ transactions most likely from “F”
      to “Y” to “M” to “Z” to “A.”
      7.4.2.2. If the depot organic repair is accomplished where the wholesale IM is collocated
      (i.e., item both managed and repaired at the same AFMC ICP), the IM can use the DODF
      screen to see pertinent D035K transactions (e.g., DIC ‘DF2’ increases in a due-in
      quantity and DIC ‘DF1’ decreases in a due-in quantity).

7.5. Centralized Repair Facility (CRF) and Base Repair.
   7.5.1. Centralized Repair Facility (CRF) regional repair consolidates intermediate
   maintenance and other activities at Forward Supply Locations (FSL) within theater.
   Intermediate maintenance includes the repair and inspection of major components which
   must be removed from the aircraft and transported to a maintenance facility. D035A, RAMP
   and WHSL do not provide the AF wholesale IM with visibility of their end items located at
   CRF facilities.
   7.5.2. Base repair is governed by negotiation between base supply and base maintenance
   organizations. RAMP acts as a pass-through to D200A for base repair-related SB&CR data
   (Percentage of Base Repair, Base Repair Cycle Time). See Chapters 6 and 9 for further
   details.

                     CONTROLLED EXCEPTIONS AND NOTICES

Section 8A—-General.

8.1. Overview.
   8.1.1. A controlled exception is a transaction that has been suspended for manual review and
   action. Table 8.3 describes reasons that D035A creates controlled exceptions and what
   actions a D035A user must take to clear them. Uncontrolled exceptions are not discussed in
   any detail in this chapter because most have been replaced by Notices. In the rare situation
   where an uncontrolled exception is encountered on the CEX screen, the user will follow
   procedures for handling Notices as detailed in Table 8.4.
   8.1.2. System Edits and Initial Processing. All transactions processed by D035A are first
   edited to ensure that certain fields contain valid data. Some data errors are automatically
   corrected by the system; however, other errors must be manually corrected.
      8.1.2.1. When a transaction cannot be corrected automatically, it is often suspended as a
      controlled exception. For example, if a requisition transaction is received that contains
      an NSN not recognized by D035A, the transaction is suspended as a controlled exception.
      This requires that a D035A user research the NSN to determine if the requisition needs to
      be: modified to reflect a different NSN, rejected back to the customer, passed to the
      correct ICP or re-processed after the requisitioned NSN data is loaded into D035A.
      8.1.2.2. Even if there are no transaction data errors, there are situations where a
      controlled exception is still created because a manual review of the transaction is required
      before it can be processed by the system. For example, all requisitions from a contractor
      organization are suspended as controlled exceptions to allow for management review.
      8.1.2.3. Controlled exceptions must be worked on a daily basis because they impact
      customer support, financial records, inventory balances, requirements data and interfaces
      with other data systems. If those assigned responsibility for working controlled
      exceptions do not understand how to work them properly, they are expected to contact a
      D035A Site Functional OPR for assistance. Controlled exceptions are assigned as
      follows:
          8.1.2.3.1. Most are assigned to the IM MDC representing the wholesale IM who
          manages the NSN in the suspended transaction.
          8.1.2.3.2. For a “1A”controlled exception, if a matching requisition is found for the
          document number on the transaction, the wholesale IM MDC assigned to the
          requisition is used to create the controlled exception.
          8.1.2.3.3. For a “1C” controlled exception, the controlled exception is defaulted to
          MDC ‘PPP’ which is assigned to the local D035A Site Functional OPR.
          8.1.2.3.4. For a “7L” or “7P” controlled exception, the default MDC of LCO is
          assigned to the exception.

          8.1.2.3.5. All other controlled exceptions that cannot be linked by NSN to a
          particular IM MDC are defaulted to MDC ‘PPP’.
8.2. Research Resources.
   8.2.1. CEX Screen. Users view controlled exceptions using the CEX menu option.
       8.2.1.1. The main exception interrogation Exception Correction screen (provides the
       following three options for displaying either a list of controlled exceptions or a specific
       controlled exception.
          8.2.1.1.1. Mgr Designator. The user can display a list of controlled exceptions by
          entering the entire three-character IM MDC (e.g., ‘LTG’), the first two positions of
          the IM MDC plus an asterisk (e.g., ‘LT*’) or the first position of the IM MDC and
          two asterisks (e.g., ‘L**’) and then pressing the “Enter” key. Using asterisks allows
          the user to view controlled exceptions assigned to multiple IM MDCs at one time. For
          example, if ‘LT*’ was input, the system retrieves all controlled exceptions assigned to
          IM MDC’s ‘LTA’ through ‘LTZ’ and ‘LT0’ through ‘LT9’.
          8.2.1.1.2. Exception Control Number. The user can display a specific controlled
          exception by entering a 10-position numeric Exception Control Number and pressing
          the “Enter” key. The DODA menu option displays an Exception Control Number if
          there is a controlled exception tied to the displayed document number. This 10-digit
          number is comprised of a 5-digit Julian date followed by a 5-digit sequence number.
          For example, the first controlled exception created by the system on Julian day 11133
          was assigned Exception Control Number ‘1113300001’.
          8.2.1.1.3. Exception Type within Mgr Designator. The user can display a list of all
          controlled exceptions with a specific type of error by entering an IM MDC and the
          applicable two-character Exception Type and then pressing the “Enter” key. Asterisks
          may be used in the IM MDC field here as described in paragraph 8.2.1.1. For
          example, entering IM MDC ‘LT*’ and exception type code ‘8A’ instructs the system
          to retrieve all the ‘8A’ controlled exceptions assigned to IM MDCs beginning with
          ‘LT’.
       8.2.1.2. If the user elected to display a list of controlled exceptions for one or more IM
       MDC, the “Controlled Exceptions by Mgr Designator Code” screen displays a list of
       exceptions sorted by priority designator (Pri), Document Identifier Code (Doc Id) and
       exception control number. The user places an ‘X’ in the field to the left of the Doc Id in
       the row s/he wishes to view/action and then presses the “Enter” key.
       8.2.1.3. For most controlled exceptions, the “Clear Controlled Exceptions” screen is used
       to display the suspended transaction. This screen is divided into two areas. The top part
       of the screen displays the transaction data split into three columns and the bottom part of
       the screen displays the Exception Type codes assigned to the transaction (maximum of
       four) along with options that the user may select to clear the controlled exception.
          8.2.1.3.1. If there is more than one Exception Type assigned and the user wants to
          reprocess the transaction, all of the Exception Type codes must be actioned before the
          system attempts to perform the reprocessing action. For example, if a receipt
          transaction is suspended with a ‘6C’ and a ‘3S’ Exception Type code, the user must
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                     363


           correct both the ‘6C’ exception and the ‘3S’ exception (the order does not matter)
           before the receipt transaction is reprocessed by the system.
           8.2.1.3.2. The Doc Id and Exception Type determine which of four possible options
           are allowed by the system. See Table 8.1.

Table 8.1. Controlled Exception Process Options
Process
        Description
Options
1         (Delete) is used to delete a controlled exception.
2         (Release) is used to release a controlled exception (i.e., reprocess the transaction with
          no data changes).
3         (Correct) is used to first modify data before the transaction is released for
          reprocessing. Based on the Doc Id and Exception Type, the system prompts for which
          data fields can/must be modified.
4         (Manager Force) is used to first modify data and assign a specific action code to the
          transaction before it is released for reprocessing. Based on the Doc Id, exception type
          and action code, the system prompts for which data fields can/must be modified.

       8.2.1.4. D035A does not always use the “Clear Controlled Exceptions” screen to display
       a suspended transaction; instead, a specific Doc Id screen is displayed. These screens
       allow the user to modify data before attempting to reprocess the transaction (pressing the
       “Enter” key instructs the system to reprocess the transaction). If the controlled exception
       can be deleted, the appropriate “PF” key is identified at the bottom of the screen.
    8.2.2. Controlled Exception Data Inquiry (DODE) Screen. The DODE screen provides
    another option for viewing a controlled exception. Use the DODA screen to inquire by
    document number for the current status of a requisition. If a controlled exception is assigned
    to that document number, the 10-digit Exception Control Number is displayed. This number
    can then be used on the DODE screen to retrieve and display the transaction that is
    suspended as a controlled exception.
    8.2.3. Controlled Exception History. When a controlled exception is successfully cleared,
    the suspended transaction data, the action taken (e.g., the exception was deleted), the UserID
    of the person who cleared the exception and a date/time stamp are recorded to the Suspended
    Action History database. Data is maintained on this database for research purposes for 120
    days. Only the adhoc query capability available to users with D035A Lead and Site
    Functional OPRs access can be used to retrieve data from the Suspended Action History
    database. Users can also view a Deleted Controlled Exceptions Summary report obtained
    through interrogation of the SCS Midtier.
    8.2.4. Helpful Websites. Use the following websites for assistance in working controlled
    exceptions:
       8.2.4.1. AF TRACKER. The AF TRACKER website displays various logistics
       transactions that were processed by DAAS. AF TRACKER also receives transaction data

                                       contact the retail location to see if the

                                       so, request the retail location generate a
                                       report of excess transaction (DIC ‘FTE’)
                                       to the wholesale IM stock control

                                       5. For a Receipt (‘D4_’ or ‘D6_’), it is
                                       likely D035K sent D035A a transaction
                                       containing project code 390. D035A

                                       circumstances. Because this receipt has
                                       already posted within the D035K
                                       domain and an asset overlay transaction
                                       (DIC ‘XB_’) has been/will be provided
                                       to update D035A asset records, use

                                       Exceptions” screen to delete the
                                       transaction. The receipt transaction will
                                       be treated as informational only; so,
                                       deleting the transaction does not
                                       negatively impact the asset position.
                                       6. For a MRP transaction with

                                       so, use Option 1 to delete the
                                       transaction; otherwise, use the NSND
                                       screen to determine if the AF manages
                                       the NSN as a NIMSC 5 item and process
                                       as follows:

                                           Chapter 9

                     ACCUMULATION OF REQUIREMENTS DATA

9.1. General.
   9.1.1. This chapter explains the various processes in the D035A subsystem associated with
   the quarterly feed of requirements data to the Secondary Items Requirements System (SIRS)
   D200A system. These processes support the 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31
   December computation cycles that compute worldwide replenishment spares requirements
   for secondary items (i.e., items that lose their identity when installed on a higher assembly).
   9.1.2. For reparable ERRC “T” items, D035A maintains quarterly usage statistics by stock
   number based on processing accountable transactions from storage or repair activity that does
   not have an interface with the RAMP subsystem. The two systems that feed requirements
   data to RAMP are the SBSS D002A system and the D035K subsystem. Refer to Chapter 6
   for more information concerning RAMP functionality.
   9.1.3. For consumable (ERRC “N” and “P”) items, D035A maintains quarterly recurring
   demand data by stock number based on processing requisition and cancellation transactions.
   9.1.4. For equipment (ERRC “S” and “U”) items, D035A does not maintain any quarterly
   requirements data. D035A does pass a copy of all accountable transactions and stock
   balances to the Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) C001 system.
9.2. Stock Balance and Consumption Report (SB&CR) Data for Reparable (ERRC “T”)
Items.
   9.2.1. D035A provides wholesale stock balances (i.e., assets stored at a site that does not use
   SBSS or D035K) by stock number as of the last day of the quarter for the following
   categories:
      9.2.1.1. Serviceable Balance Quantity. This quantity is the sum of all stock balances in
      SCCs A, B, and C.
      9.2.1.2. Unserviceable Reparable Balance Quantity. This quantity is the sum of all stock
      balances in SCCs E, F, G, J, K, L, and 1.
      9.2.1.3. Technical Order Compliance Balance Quantity. This quantity is the sum of all
      stock balances in SCCs D, Q, R and 3.
      9.2.1.4. Due In from Overhaul Balance Quantity. This quantity is the sum of all stock
      balances in SCC M.
      9.2.1.5. Stock balances in SCCs H, P, S and 2 are not provided to D200A.
   9.2.2. D035A provides wholesale consumption data (i.e., assets stored at a site that does not
   use SBSS or D035K) by stock number for transactions processed during the current quarter
   for the following categories:
      9.2.2.1. Overhaul Reparable Generation Quantity. This quantity is updated when a
      receipt (DIC ‘D6_’) transaction is passed to the financial system and all the following
      conditions are true:
470                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


         9.2.2.1.1. The DIC is not ‘D6K’, which indicates a relocation of an asset already
         under D035A ownership rather than a return of an asset to D035A ownership.
         9.2.2.1.2. The SCC is E, F or G.
         9.2.2.1.3. The document number does not begin with ‘FB’ (a ‘FB’ document number
         indicates a SBSS or D035K activity returned the asset, so RAMP is responsible for
         reporting this consumption data).
      9.2.2.2. Overhaul Condemned Quantity. This quantity is updated when a ‘D6_’ receipt
      transaction is passed to the financial system and the following conditions are true:
         9.2.2.2.1. The DIC is not ‘D6K’.
         9.2.2.2.2. The SCC is H.
      9.2.2.3. Account Increase Quantity. This quantity is updated when one of the following
      transactions is passed to the financial system:
         9.2.2.3.1. A ‘D4_’ receipt transaction.
         9.2.2.3.2. A ‘D6_’ receipt transaction (unless the DIC is ‘D6K’).
         9.2.2.3.3. A ‘D8_’ inventory adjustment gain transaction.
      9.2.2.4. Inventory Adjustment Voucher Quantity Plus. This quantity is updated when a
      ‘D8_’ inventory adjustment gain transaction is passed to the financial system.
      9.2.2.5. Shipment from Account Quantity. This quantity is updated when a ‘D7_’ issue
      transaction is passed to the financial system to show a shipment unless the DIC is ‘D7K’
      (indicates a relocation of an asset and a ‘D6K’ receipt is expected).
      9.2.2.6. Transfer to DLA Disposition Services quantity. This quantity is updated when a
      ‘D7J’ issue transaction is passed to the financial system to show a shipment to a disposal
      activity.
      9.2.2.7. Inventory Adjustment Voucher Quantity Minus. This quantity is updated when a
      ‘D9_’ inventory adjustment loss transaction is passed to the financial system.
      9.2.2.8. Shipment to Security Assistance Program (SAP) Quantity. This quantity is
      updated when a ‘D7D’ or ‘D7E’ issue transaction is passed to the financial system to
      show a shipment to a SAP customer (i.e., Grant Aid or Foreign Military Sales).
      9.2.2.9. Shipment to Non-Reporting Activity Quantity. This quantity is updated when a
      ‘D7_’ issue transaction is passed to the financial system to show a shipment and the
      following are true:
         9.2.2.9.1. The DIC is not ‘D7D’, ‘D7E’, ‘D7J’ or ‘D7K’.
         9.2.2.9.2. The ship-to customer does not use SBSS or D035K. These systems report
         consumption data to RAMP on a daily basis, so a customer that uses one of these
         systems is considered a ‘reporting activity’.
  9.2.3. ‘D4_’, ‘D6_’, ‘D7_’, ‘D8_’ and ‘D9_’ reversal transactions are also used to update
  consumption data, but rather than adding the transaction quantity to the appropriate
  consumption data fields, the transaction quantity is subtracted from these fields.

   9.2.4. The wholesale stock balance and consumption data are reported to D200A using the
   ‘ZCQ’/‘C’ transaction. D035A creates a ‘ZCQ’/‘C’ transaction for any stock number with a
   numeric PSC that has at least one wholesale stock balance or consumption record. Refer to
   Table 9.1 for the ‘ZCQ’/‘C’ format.

    9.2.5. The D035A DODF menu option can be used to review all transactions from a quarter
    that were used to compute the consumption data. The first DODF screen allows the user to
    select the date range and the stock number of transactions to retrieve.
    9.2.6. D035A may or may not have visibility of assets being repaired under a DMISA. This
    must be considered when performing file maintenance against the stock balance and
    consumption data in D200A.
9.3. Stock Balance and Demand Data for Consumable (ERRC “N” and “P”) Items.
    9.3.1. D035A provides wholesale stock balances (i.e., assets stored at a site that does not use
    SBSS or D035K) by stock number as of the last day of the quarter for all stock balances in
    SCCs A, B and C. This stock balance data is provided in the “Serviceable Balance Quantity”
    field.
    9.3.2. D035A does not provide wholesale consumption data for ERRC “N” and “P” items.
    Instead, the recurring demand is computed from requisition and cancellation transactions
    processed during the quarter. This demand data is provided in the “Overhaul Condemned
    Quantity” field to D200A. Recurring demand is computed as follows for each D035A
    managed consumable stock number:
         9.3.2.1. All requisitions with a demand code of “R,” which is the default value assigned
         by D035A if the requisition transaction does not contain a demand code, that were
         received during the current quarter are used to create one of the following types of
         transactions:
            9.3.2.1.1. For a requisition from a D035K customer (the document number contains a
            ‘FB2029’, ‘FB2039’ or ‘FB2065’ DoDAAC), the requisitioned quantity is used to
            create a ‘ZCQ’/‘C’ transaction to report positive demand.
            9.3.2.1.2. For a requisition from a SBSS customer (the document number contains a
            ‘FB’ DoDAAC that is not a D035K DoDAAC), the requisitioned quantity is used to
            create a ‘ZCA’/‘T’ transaction to report positive demand. Refer to Table 9.2 for the
            ‘ZCA’/‘T’ format.
            9.3.2.1.3. For all other customer types (SAP requisitions and ‘FD’ requisitions are
            skipped), the requisitioned quantity is used to create a ‘ZCQ’/‘C’ transaction to report
            positive demand.

       9.3.2.2. After the requisition transactions are used to create the positive demand
       transactions for the current quarter, cancellation transactions processed during the current
       quarter are used to compute negative demand if they meet the following criteria:
          9.3.2.2.1. The cancellation status code must be BQ, BR, BS, CS or FB.
          9.3.2.2.2. The cancellation action cannot have been reversed.
          9.3.2.2.3. The original requisition must have used demand code “R” and must have
          processed within the last eight quarters.
       9.3.2.3. Based on the document number DoDAAC, the cancellation quantity is used to
       create a ‘ZCA’/‘T’, ‘ZCQ’/‘C’ or ‘ZCQ’/‘H’ transaction to report negative demand. The
       Effective Date field on the transaction is used to identify which quarter the negative
       demand occurred. The Effective Date is set to the last day of the quarter in which the
       original demand occurred.
       9.3.2.4. The ‘ZCA’/‘T’, ‘ZCQ’/‘C’ and ‘ZCQ’/‘H’ transactions reporting positive
       demand are combined with the ‘ZCA’/‘T’, ‘ZCQ’/‘C’ and’ ZCQ’/‘H’ transactions
       reporting negative demand to create one transaction per DoDAAC, Stock Number and
       Effective Date. The recurring demand reported for the current quarter can never be less
       than zero, while the recurring demand reported for previous quarters is always negative.
9.4. Quarterly Process Overview.
   9.4.1. On a daily basis, SBSS and D035K send stock balance and consumption data to
   RAMP for any stock number with a recorded accountable transaction. RAMP accumulates
   this data by stock number and DoDAAC.
       9.4.1.1. The daily feed from SBSS to RAMP includes the following types of
       transactions:
          9.4.1.1.1. ‘D4S’ local purchase receipts.
          9.4.1.1.2. ‘D6_’ receipts (closes intransit records in RAMP).
          9.4.1.1.3. ‘D7_’ issues (can create an intransit record in RAMP).
          9.4.1.1.4. ‘D8_’ inventory gain adjustments.
          9.4.1.1.5. ‘D9_’ inventory loss adjustments.
          9.4.1.1.6. ‘DAC’ inter-condition transfers.
          9.4.1.1.7. ‘7LF’, ‘9QK’ and ‘9QN’ asset statuses.
       9.4.1.2. The daily feed from D035K to RAMP includes the following types of
       transactions:
          9.4.1.2.1. ‘XBB’ retail stock balance reports.
          9.4.1.2.2. ‘XBD’ wholesale stock balance reports.
          9.4.1.2.3. ‘XBI’ maintenance stock balance reports.
          9.4.1.2.4. ‘XBT’ consumption reports (a summary of accountable transactions from
          Retail Transaction History for the current day).

    9.4.2. On January 1st, April 1st, July 1st and October 1st, the following work units are
    executed:
         9.4.2.1. Quarterly M01. This work unit accepts two files from RAMP:
            9.4.2.1.1. “B31MB”. This file contains worldwide intransit asset data by stock
            number for both serviceable and unserviceable SCCs. It is copied into the file named
            “SYSPRD.SCD035.B31MB0U”. This data is used to create ‘ZCA’/‘E’ transactions in
            a later step. Refer to Table 9.3 for the ‘ZCA’/‘E’ format.
            9.4.2.1.2. “B33RD”. This file contains worldwide asset and levels data by stock
            number and DoDAAC reported by SBSS and D035K to RAMP. It is copied into the
            file named “SYSPRD.SCD035.B33RD0U”. This data is used to create ‘ZCA’/‘1’ and
            ‘ZCA’/‘A’ transactions in a later step. Refer to Table 9.4 for the ‘ZCA’/‘1’ format
            and refer to Table 9.5 for the ‘ZCA’/‘A’ format.

         9.4.2.2. Quarterly 100. This work unit creates the Processing Master File, which contains
         stock number data, due-out data, due-in data, levels data and stock balance data. The file
         name used is “SYSPRD.SCD035.A346D0U”. This work unit also copies the stock
         balance data to file “SYSPRD.SCD035.EOQ.TAF022A0” for research purposes.
         9.4.2.3. Monthly 105. This work unit creates the Requirements History File, which
         contains stock number data and consumption data. The file name used is
         “SYSPRD.ZZU.A357ACUQ.”
    9.4.3. On January 5th, April 5th, July 5th and October 5th, quarterly work unit ‘201’ is run to
    create files for quarterly work unit ‘202’. The various steps in this work unit are as follows:
         9.4.3.1. Requisition and cancellation transactions are used to create a file of positive and
         negative demands for ERRC “N” and “P” stock numbers. The file created is named
         “SYSPRD.SCD035.DAQ910AU.”
         9.4.3.2. The Processing Master File and the Requirements History File are merged into
         one file. The file name is “SYSPRD.SCD035.A3AUG0U”. Only stock numbers with a
         numeric PSC and an AAC other than ‘P’ (FMS use only) are copied into the
         “A3AUG0U” file.
         9.4.3.3. The stock balance and levels data reported by the Special Support Stock Control
         (SSSC) system for aggregation accounts is copied into a file named
         “SYSPRD.SCD035.A5WKA0U”. The process that creates this file in SSSC currently is
         not active.
         9.4.3.4. The engine exchange reparable generations data reported by the AFMC Data
         Depot (Q302) system is copied into a file named SYSPRD.SCD035.ALIG3B0.
         9.4.3.5. The data in the “DAQ911BU” file is reformatted according to the
         D035A/D200A-A Interface Control Document (ICD) and placed into a file for quarterly
         ‘202’. The file name is “SYSPRD.SCD035.DAQ912EU”. A copy of the data is also
         placed into a file named “SYSPRD.SCD035.DAQ912FU”. If data does not pass all edits,
         it is only copied into the “DAQ912FU” file. The edits performed are as follows:
            9.4.3.5.1. The stock number must exist.
            9.4.3.5.2. The unit of issue must be valid.
            9.4.3.5.3. D035A must be the SOS for the stock number. Obsolete or inactive stock
            numbers identified by the SOS code ‘JCD’ are not considered valid stock numbers.
            9.4.3.5.4. The PSC for the stock number must be ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’ or ‘5’.
            9.4.3.5.5. The ERRC must be “N,” “P” or “T.”
            9.4.3.5.6. The DoDAAC must exist, so SB&CR data for a SBSS site that was shut
            down during the quarter may not passed on to D200A.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                               479


         9.4.3.5.7. The AAC is not ‘P’.
     9.4.3.6. The “DAQ912FU” file is used to create the “Cumulative SB&CR” report and
     the “SB&CR Rejects” report.
     9.4.3.7. If management responsibility for a stock number transferred from one D035A
     site to another D035A site during the quarter, the SB&CR data for that stock number is
     now transferred to the gaining D035A site to be used as input for quarterly work unit
     ‘202’.
  9.4.4. On January 15th, April 15th, July 15th and October 15th, the following work units are
  executed:
     9.4.4.1. Quarterly M02. This work unit accepts the “B235A0U” file from RAMP. This
     file contains updated quarterly summary records, which are a summary of consumption
     data (i.e., accumulated data from ‘D4_’, ‘D6_’, ‘D7_’, ‘D8_’, ‘D9_’ and ‘DAC’
     transactions) passed from SBSS and D035K to RAMP.
     9.4.4.2. Quarterly ‘202’. This work unit creates the “B1DXD0U” file, which is the one
     that is actually used by D200A. The various steps in this work unit are as follows:
         9.4.4.2.1. If SB&CR data was sent by a losing D035A site, it is copied into a file
         named “SYSPRD.SCD035.FRI60N0”.
         9.4.4.2.2. The data from the “B235A0U” file, the “FRI60N0” file, the “ZZ165D0”
         file and the “DAQ912EU” file are combined into one file named
         “SYSPRD.SCD035.DAQ911BU”.
         9.4.4.2.3. The data in the “DAQ911BU” file is reformatted according to the
         D035A/D200A-A         ICD    and   placed    into      the        file    named
         “SYSPRD.SCD035.B1DXD0U”. A copy of the data is also placed into a file named
         “SYSPRD.SCD035.DAQ912FU”. If data does not pass all edits, it is only copied into
         the “DAQ912FU” file.
         9.4.4.2.4. The “DAQ912FU” file is used to create the “Cumulative SB&CR” report
         and the “SB&CR Rejects” report.
         9.4.4.2.5. The demand data in the “DAQ910AU” file is sorted and summed and then
         merged with the “B1DXD0U” file.
         9.4.4.2.6. The final step is to copy the “B1DXD0U” file into a file named
         “SCDPRD*.ZZU.BDXD0”, where the ‘*’ is equal to ‘G’ for the Ogden D035A, ‘H’
         for the Oklahoma City D035A, ‘L’ for the Warner Robins D035A or ‘P’ for the San
         Antonio D035A. This is the actual file copied by D200A to compute worldwide
         replenishment spares requirements.

                                           Chapter 10

                         MATERIEL RETURNS PROGRAM (MRP)

10.1. Overview. This chapter provides D035A procedures for information interchange between
reporting activities and ICPs associated with reporting and disposition of assets via the DoD
MRP. It details actions taken to maximize use of excess assets and provide credit and/or
disposition instructions to reporting activities via mechanical or manual actions. It also provides
procedures for soliciting assets owned by foreign countries for AF use.
   10.1.1. Visibility. All excess reporting transactions, whether mechanical or manual, are
   recorded on excess history records. The record of a given excess report is retained on the file
   for 180 days following the recording of all appropriate completed actions taken on the entire
   quantity reported as excess.
   10.1.2. Follow-ups and cancellations (DICs FTF and FTC) are processed against excess
   history records. Responses are processed mechanically when excess history records reflect
   completed actions; otherwise, they are output to the IM for action. Note: Only one each
   DIC FTD, FTF and FTT per document number/suffix combination will be posted to excess
   history records.
   10.1.3. D035A screens which provide excess history data are: EXCA displays data for
   reports of excess where AF is PICA; EXCB displays data for reports of excess where AF is
   SICA; DODB displays data for reports of excess where AF is either PICA or SICA.
10.2. Reports of Excess.
   10.2.1. AFMC ICP D035A MRP business processes are categorized as either AF PICA or
   AF SICA depending on whether AF has primary management responsibility for an item
   within the DoD.
       10.2.1.1. Sub-processes differ depending on whether the reporting activity is a
       capitalized customer: Capitalized customers use either SBSS or D035K to submit

  10.2.2. AF PICA Processes.
      10.2.2.1. Reporting activities will either use RAMP procedures or generate ‘FTA’ or
      ‘FTE’ excess reporting transactions to ICPs as detailed in Table 10.2. For transaction
      format see paragraph 13.19.1.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                     487

                Recoverable items (ERRC “T”). Follow RAMP reporting procedures. See
                paragraph 6.8 for additional guidance.
                EOQ items (ERRC “N” and “P”). D035A is designed to use RAMP ‘ZBE’ (base
                excess) transactions. Note: If a base sends an ‘FTE’ transaction with their ‘FB’
                DoDAAC in the document number field, D035A will follow the normal PICA
                ‘FTE’ process.
  AF Base       Equipment items (ERRC “S” and “U”). Bases must use AFEMS (not D035A) to
                get disposition instructions for excess equipment items. However, if the base
                sends an ‘FTE’ transaction with their ‘FE’ DoDAAC to report excess equipment,
                D035A will record the ‘FTE’ transaction to history, but will not process it.
                Reports of excess from AF bases in these areas will be submitted in DIC ‘FTE’
                format. Note: SBSS is not supposed to use the ‘FTE’ process period for
                reporting excess materiel to D035A.

                1. Recoverable item excess materiel is reported to D035A with one of two type
                ‘FT_’ transactions:
                1.1. Unserviceable assets:
                1.1.1. NIMSC 5 – Use DIC ‘FTA’.

                1.1.2. Non-NIMSC 5 – Use DIC ‘FTE’.
  Service/
  Agency        1.2. Serviceable assets; use DIC ‘FTE’.
                2. EOQ and Equipment item excess materiel is reported to D035A with an ‘FTE’
                transaction.
                Reports of excess from Other Services in these areas will be submitted in DIC

                reported to D035A with an ‘FTE’ transaction.

             10.2.2.1.1. If the ‘FTA’ or ‘FTE’ transaction (or any other ‘FT_’ transaction going to
             the ICP) contains an incorrect ICP RIC, DAAS will reroute the transaction to the
             correct destination and send the reporting activity an ‘FTQ’ transaction with status
             code TZ identifying the correct ICP RIC for use in follow-on transactions.

            10.2.2.1.2. In response to an ‘FTE’ transaction, the reporting activity expects to
            receive from the ICP either ‘FTR’ disposition instructions (see paragraph 10.2.2.3.2)
            or ‘FTD’ processing delay notification (see paragraph 10.2.2.3.3). If no such
            response is received, the reporting activity can process an ‘FTF’ follow-up transaction
            as detailed in paragraph 10.2.2.4.
       10.2.2.2. Follow-on processing includes shipments, receipts and cancellations as
       reflected in Table 10.3.

                             1. Regardless whether credit is to be granted for authorized materiel
                             returns, the reporting activity sends the ICP an ‘FTL’ transaction
                             indicating when materiel will be shipped. Note: The reporting
                             activity can skip this step and instead ship the materiel/notify the ICP
                             as shown in the next two paragraphs.
                             2. The reporting activity ships the materiel to the location identified
                             by the ICP in the ‘FTR’ transaction.
                          3. When the materiel is shipped, the reporting activity generates an
                          ‘FTM’ transaction containing the shipment’s TCN to advise the ICP
                Reporting regarding actual shipment date.
Shipments
                Activity  3.1. Upon receipt of the ‘FTM’ transaction: D035A forwards a
                          ‘DW_’ transaction to the storage activity.
                             3.2. Every 30 days (CONUS) or 60 DAYS (OCONUS) after
                             receiving an ‘FTM’ transaction, if no ‘D6_’ transaction has been
                             received from the storage activity, then D035A sends the reporting
                             activity a ‘FT6’ transaction. In response to the ‘FT6’, the reporting
                             activity shall review records to determine if shipment has occurred.
                             If shipment has not occurred, the reporting activity will generate a
                             ‘FTL’ citing the new ESD of the shipment action. If the materiel has
                             been shipped, a new ‘FTM’ shall be created.
                             1. If materiel is not received within prescribed timeframes:
                             1.1. D035A will cancel return authorization and send the reporting
                             activity an ‘FTZ’ transaction with one of two status codes:
                             1.1.1. TP, creditable return authorization cancelled.
                             1.1.2. TV, non-creditable return authorization cancelled.

                             2. If materiel is received within prescribed timeframes:
                             2.1. D035K sends the collocated D035J a ‘D6_’ transaction to show
                             an increase in inventory.
                             2.2. D035K sends D035A a ‘D6_’ receipt transaction. D035A then
                             sends the reporting activity a transaction with one of the following

                            DIC/status code combinations:
                            2.2.1. DIC ‘FTR’:
                            2.2.1.1. TF – status being investigated.
                            2.2.1.2. TT – materiel in process of inspection and classification.
                            2.2.2. DIC ‘FTZ’:
                            2.2.2.1. TL – no credit allowed as item received was other than that
                            authorized for return.
                            2.2.2.2. TM – no credit allowed as condition received was less than
                            reported.
                            2.2.2.3. TN – credit authorized.
                            2.2.2.4. TQ – no credit allowed as specified in original reply to
                            report of excess.
                            2.2.2.5. T1 – no credit allowed because NSN changed from stock
                            fund to appropriated fund item.
                          1. When the reporting activity receives an ‘FTR’ transaction, they
                          can respond with an ‘FTC’ transaction to cancel part or all of the
                Reporting original excess quantity reported on the ‘FTE’ transaction.
                Activity
                          2. The reporting activity may send the ‘FTC’ because the materiel is
                          no longer considered excess or the materiel is no longer available.
Cancellations               1. Upon receipt of an ‘FTC’ transaction, D035A takes multiple
                            actions:
                ICP         1.1. Records the ‘FTC’ transaction.
                            1.2. Sends an ‘FTR’ transaction with status code TC to the reporting
                            activity.

       10.2.2.3. Follow-ups. At various stages within MRP, either the reporting activity or the
       ICP can generate follow-up transactions to each other to obtain updated status as
       reflected in Table 10.4.

   10.2.3. AF SICA excess processing steps differ depending upon whether assets being
   reported are for items managed using NIMSC 5 procedures (see paragraph 10.3 for non-
   DoD instructions).
      10.2.3.1. For NIMSC 5 items, the AF SICA ICP must report all serviceable excesses to
      the PICA to obtain disposition instructions and must also return all unserviceable assets
      to PICA-designated repair centers for overhaul. Procedures are detailed in Table 10.5.

Table 10.5. AF SICA Processing Procedures for NIMSC 5 Items
Step Type Process                                       Description
1      AF retail           RAMP provides D035A DIC ‘ZBE’ base retail excess reporting
       activities report   transactions each processing cycle as long as a serviceable excess
       excess to AF        exists.
       SICA ICP
                           D035K provides D035A DIC XBD depot retail asset overlay
                           transactions only when an asset balance changes.
2      AF SICA ICP         For unserviceable excess assets, D035A sends the PICA a DIC ‘FTE’
       reports to PICA     report of excess transaction.
                           For serviceable excess assets, D035A will hold the report for 60 days
                           unless no ‘ZBE’ is received or if an ‘XBD’ is received blanking out
                           the quantity. An ‘FTE’ transaction will be output after 60 days.
3      AF SICA awaits      D035A expects to receive a DIC ‘FTR’ response transaction back
       PICA response.      from the PICA within 30 days of generating the ‘FTE’ transaction.
                           1. If no ‘FTR’ is received within that time frame, D035A will send a
                           DIC ‘FTF’ follow-up transaction to the PICA.
                           2. If the asset position changes (via a ‘ZBE’ or ‘XBD’ transaction)
                           prior to receiving PICA response, D035A sends the PICA an ‘FTC’
                           cancellation of an excess report transaction for the quantity no longer
                           excess.
4      AF SICA             D035A processes PICA ‘FTR’ transactions as follows:
       processes PICA
                                                       Action Taken
       response.
                           D035A will generate a notice as detailed in paragraph 8.4 for all of
                           the following status codes: SA, SB, SC, SF, SH, SJ, SK, SL, SN,
                           TD, TE and TG.
                           For status code SG, D035A will search for a duplicate document. If
                           found, the system generates a notice. If a duplicate record does not
                           exist, the ‘FTR’ will be disregarded.
                           For status code SM, D035A suspends reporting of the assets on that
                           NSN until the date in rp 70-73 of the ‘FTR’ transaction passes. If the
                           excess still exists after that date passes, D035A will send the PICA
                           an ‘FTE’ transaction using a new document number.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                            493


Step Type Process                                Description
                    For status codes TA and TB, D035A will send a copy of the ‘FTR’
                    transaction (with M&S code changed to ‘4’) to the reporting retail
                    activity.
                    1. The system will establish a suspense (7 days if the ‘FTR’
                    transaction contained priority code ‘01’ – ‘08’ or 15 days if the
                    ‘FTR’ transaction contained priority code ‘09’ – ‘15’) by which it
                    expects to receive a ‘D7B’ issue transactions back from the reporting
                    retail activity.
                    2. If the ‘D7B’ transaction is not received within the 7-day or 15-day
                    time frame, D035A will send the retail reporting activity an ‘FT6’
                    follow-up for shipment status transaction.
                    For status code TC:
                    1. D035A will send a copy of the ‘FTR’ transaction (with M&S code
                    changed to ‘4’) to the reporting retail activity.
                    2. D035A will create a DRO (DIC ‘A5J’) or RAMP will create an
                    RDO (DIC ‘A2A’) disposal transaction depending on the storage
                    location of the excess materiel.
                    2.1.1. If the excess materiel is stored at an ALC, D035A will
                    transmit a DIC ‘A5J’ disposal transaction to the appropriate D035K,
                    which it will forward to the DSS for action. D035K is responsible
                    for accountable balance record updates, the financial feed and the
                    SB&CR feed to RAMP.
                    2.1.2. If the excess materiel is stored at a non-ALC storage activity,
                    D035A will transmit a DIC ‘A5J’ disposal transaction to the
                    appropriate storage activity. Creating the DRO transaction causes
                    D035A to update its accountable balance record, which results in the
                    creation of an Issue to Disposal transaction (DIC ‘D7J’).
                    2.1.3. If the excess materiel is stored at an AF base, RAMP will
                    transmit an ‘A2A’ RDO disposal transaction to the appropriate
                    SBSS. The SBSS is responsible for asset balance updates, the
                    financial feed and the SB&CR feed to RAMP.

                            For status codes TH and TJ, D035A will check the NSN to see if it
                            agrees with what was in the ‘FTE’ transaction:
                            3. If it agrees, the system will send a copy of the ‘FTR’ transaction
                            to the reporting retail activity:
                            3.1. ‘FTR’ modified:
                            3.1.1. M&S code changed to ‘4’.
                            3.1.2. Status code changed from TH to TA or from TJ to TB.
                            3.2. The system will establish a suspense (7 days if the ‘FTR’
                            transaction contained priority code 01 – 08 or 15 days if the ‘FTR’
                            transaction contained priority code 09 – 15) by which it expects to
                            receive a ‘D7B’ issue transactions back from the reporting retail
                            activity. If the ‘D7B’ transaction is not received within the 7-day or
                            15-day time frame, D035A will send the retail reporting activity an
                            ‘FT6’ follow-up for shipment status transaction.
                            4. If it disagrees, the system will suspend the transaction as a “6F”
                            controlled exception. See Chapter 8.
                            For status codes TK, T6and T7, D035A will check the NSN to see if
                            it agrees with what was in the ‘FTE’ transaction:
                            1. If it agrees, processing is the same as for ‘FTR’ transactions with
                            status code TC.
                            2. If it disagrees, the D035A will suspend the transaction as a “6F”
                            controlled exception.
                            For status codes TF, TT and TU, D035A will add 30 days to the
                            ‘FTZ’ follow-up date (see Step 7 in this table).
5      Reporting activity   If the reporting activity receives ‘FTR’/‘TA’ or ‘FTR’/‘TB’
       processes AF         transactions, it will initiate shipment action and either:
       SICA disposition     1. D035K will send D035A a ‘BLO’ shipment confirmation or
       transactions.
                            2. SBSS will send D035A a ‘D7M’ transaction when it ships an
                            unserviceable asset back to the PICA’s SOR location.
                            If the reporting activity receives a DRO or RDO disposal transaction,
                            it will use the transaction to ship materiel to DLA Disposition
                            Services.
                            1. Depot retail D035K processing:
                            1.1. The reporting activity will transmit a DRO Shipment

                         quantity from the DRO transaction that was not successfully shipped
                         to DLA Disposition Services. Note: The ‘ARJ’ confirmation or ‘A6J’
                         denial transaction is sent by DSS directly to D035K, which forwards
                         a copy of the transaction on to the appropriate D035A.
                         2. SBSS base retail processing:
                         2.1. The reporting activity may or may not use the RDO transaction
                         from RAMP to ship materiel to DLA Disposition Services because
                         processing this RDO transaction requires SBSS manual intervention.
                         It may be necessary for the wholesale IM to contact the base to
                         ensure disposal action is accomplished.
                         2.2. SBSS will transmit an RDO Shipment Confirmation transaction
                         (DIC ‘BL0’) back to D035A for the quantity successfully shipped to
                         DLA Disposition Services.
                         2.3. If necessary, SBSS will transmit an RDO Shipment Denial
                         transaction (DIC ‘B7A’) back to D035A for any quantity from the
                         RDO transaction that was not successfully shipped to DLA
                         Disposition Services.

     final response      shipment status transaction, the system will send an ‘FTT’ follow-up
     from PICA.          for receipt acknowledgement transaction to the PICA.
                         2. If D035A does receive the ‘FTZ’ transaction the record is closed.

      10.2.3.2. Procedures for processing Non-NIMSC 5 excesses to the PICA. Wholesale
      IMs will use the AUXD screen to manually create and send DIC FTE to the PICA to
      process Non-NIMSC 5 excess materiel. The PICA responds with DIC FTR and then
      normal processing logic is followed. If DIC FTR is not returned, the wholesale IM will
      have to use the AUXD screen again to manually create the missing DIC FTR. Note:
      Wholesale IMs must not use this type action to give themselves credit for returned
      materiel.

10.3. Non-DoD PICA Activities.
   10.3.1. There are a few non-DoD PICA activities that do not use the MRP. In order to return
   excess AF SICA assets to these activities the IMS must manually receive disposition
   instructions from the PICA IM and then manually enter various transactions into D035A.
   10.3.2. This manual process is necessary in order to maintain a valid audit trail of the action.
   There are two options when doing this manual process: process as a manager forced
   shipment or as a Report of Excess.
   10.3.3. If the Manager Forced Shipment process is used:
       10.3.3.1. Use the NEW screen to post DIC A0A with manager action ‘O2’ transaction to
       send DIC A2A to the base with excess assets.
       10.3.3.2. The SBSS may or may not process DIC A2A. The D035A IM will need to
       monitor their transaction history to determine if the base actually shipped the item. The
       IM may have to call to the base to ensure the item is shipped.
       10.3.3.3. SBSS may or may not generate the ‘BL0’ shipment confirmation transaction to
       D035A. If not, the D035A IM will use the CFDA screen to post the missing BL0
       transaction. If this is not done, the system will post DIC ARH 60 days after the original
       “A2A” transaction.
       10.3.3.4. Use the AUXC screen to post a ‘DRA’ transaction to close the manager forced
       shipment. If this is not done, the system will post a DRB transaction 60 days after the
       shipment confirmation ‘BL0’ or ‘ARH’ to force close the document number.
       10.3.4.1. If the Report of Excess process is used:
       10.3.4.2. Use the OVRH screen to post a ‘ZBE’ transaction to pick up the excess assets
       to D035A's inventory records.
       10.3.4.3. Use the AUXD screen to post DIC FTE.
       10.3.4.4. Use the AUXD screen to post DIC FTR to send DIC A2A to the base with
       excess assets.
       10.3.4.5. SBSS may or may not process DIC A2A. The D035A IM will need to monitor
       their transaction history to determine if the base actually shipped the item. The IM may
       have to call to the base to ensure the item is shipped.
       10.3.4.6. SBSS may or may not send a ‘BL0’ shipment confirmation transaction to
       D035A. If not, the D035A IM will use the AUXD screen to post the missing ‘FTM’
       shipment confirmation transaction (which is the same thing as a BL0 transaction).
       10.3.4.7. Use the AUXD screen to post DIC FTZ to close the ‘FTE’ transaction. The
       system will not force close the “FTE,” so it is very important that the IM perform this
       final step.
10.4. Solicitation of Foreign Country Owned Assets for AF Use.
   10.4.1. To obtain foreign country-owned assets for AF use, the wholesale IM must pay for
   the asset and fund the transportation cost incurred with the returned asset. Refer to DSCA
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                   497


  5105.38-M, Security Assistance Management Manual, for additional details concerning when
  an asset may be bought from a foreign country.
  10.4.2. Solicitation will be done by message and contain instructions to respond by message,
  whenever possible. Assets will be paid for according to current stock list prices plus
  administrative additives or the original cost to the country plus administrative additives;
  whichever is greater if the original cost can be determined. Reimbursement for
  transportation costs incurred by the country in obtaining the asset will not be authorized. The
  message should provide item’s availability and lead-time for the purpose of the customer’s
  later requisitioning action, if required.
  10.4.3. If a positive response is received, the IM will notify the proper accounting and
  finance section by letter, through the division funds control activity, of the intent to procure
  the asset from a foreign country.
     10.4.3.1. The letter will contain the funds appropriation site used in procuring the asset
     and a request that an obligation be established. After notification that funds have been
     obligated, the IM, in coordination with the distribution functional office, will provide the
     country complete return shipping instructions, including the data and information
     required in completing all necessary parts of the DD Form 1348-1A.
     10.4.3.2. The materiel will be routed, at AF expense, to the nearest US/DOD shipping
     activity identified by the IM for receipt and onward movement. Any onward movement
     from that point will be under AF title. The local transportation office will furnish the
     appropriate transportation funding information (transportation account code [TAC] and
     appropriation). The shipping instructions will include, but not limited to, an ‘FD20__’
     document number, name and address of the installation to receive the materiel for
     subsequent movement to the depot, applicable TAC and specific instructions to enter the
     message cite number, originator’s address and office symbol and subject in block ‘AA’ of
     the DD Form 1348-1A.
  10.4.4. Instruct the country to forward a copy of the shipping document signed by the
  designated US/DOD activity.
  10.4.5. After the receipt of a copy of the signed shipping ticket, a letter will be prepared
  citing the funds to be used in reimbursing the country, country to be reimbursed and amount
  and forwarded to the appropriate accounting and finance function with instructions to prepare
  a check with supporting documentation and forward to AFAFC/SAAC/FSR for deposit in the
  country’s trust fund holding account (XLC).
  10.4.6. Should the country require a replacement, they will be advised that the replacement
  will be obtained using the normal requisitioning procedures against a case.

                           MANAGING ITEM RECORD DATA

11.1. Overview. This chapter outlines the life cycle (establishment, maintenance and deletion)
of item records for NSNs and NC/ND/K numbers for which an AFMC ICP has IM
responsibility.
11.2. Establishing an Item Record.
   11.2.1. Initially, D043 gives D035A sufficient information to build a record on the SCD-
   ITEMS-REC table. Updates to most data on this table are received from D043 in subsequent
   overlays.
   11.2.2. D035A gives users the capability via DIC ‘ZAA’ transactions (see paragraph
   13.17.1 for input format) to manually establish item records only in the following categories:
       11.2.2.1. NSNs managed by Other Services.
       11.2.2.2. Non-prime NC, ND and K NSNs.
       11.2.2.3. Prime and Non-Prime NSNs containing a J-series ICP RIC (e.g., ‘JCS’).
   11.2.3. D035K has the capability via DIC ‘ZFA’ transactions to establish item records used
   in processing depot maintenance requisitions. See Volume 4 for details.
   11.2.4. SSSC gives users the capability to establish item records for Non-AFMC managed
   items used in processing either contractor GFE/GFM requisitions or aggregation account
   transactions. See Volume 5 for details.
   11.2.5. D035A gives users the capability via DIC ‘XAG’ transactions (see paragraph
   13.17.5 for input format) to request D043 provide CMD to update SCD-ITEMS-REC
   information for the interrogated NSNs. Note: This process usually takes 24 to 48 hours to
   complete.
   11.2.6. Item record data is automatically synched from mainframe to SCS Midtier.
11.3. Maintaining an Item Record.
   11.3.1. Table 11 1 identifies data elements that originate in D035A, RAMP and WHSL
   (i.e., does not include data elements that originate in D043).
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                   499

                          Because this interface is provided to
                          D035A weekly, any required changes will

                          from D200A. Because this is a quarterly
                          interface, the ability to update these levels
                          is necessary due to program changes,

Constant Reject Code   IMs can cause D035A to automatically            See paragraph 13.17.7
                       reject requisitions by assigning a Constant     for input of a ‘ZFB’
                       Reject Code to an item. The goal is to          transaction to modify
                       prevent issue of unsafe items and eliminate     this data element.
                       unnecessary creation of controlled
                       exceptions on requisitions that can be
                       rejected automatically.
                       1. Constant Reject Codes are assigned to
                       the item master record either as the result
                       of a Stock List Change (SLC) or manual
                       file maintenance action.
                       1.1. At the time the IM assigns a Constant
                       Reject Code to an item or changes it to a
                       different code, s/he must also use the IUTV
                       screen to file maintain narrative text
                       explaining the reason for cancellation.
                       1.2. IUTV screen input triggers an update
                       which overwrites any information
                       previously posted for that document
                       number on the IUTU screen. Note:
                       Narrative will not be applied to requisitions
                       cancelled prior to when the text was input
                       via the IUTV screen. The IM can manually
                       update the IUTU screen narrative for that
                       document number to add any text
                       overwritten in this process.
                       1.3. IMs must at least annually review
                       their NSNs that have Constant Reject
                       Codes assigned and remove any invalid
                       codes.
                       2. When D035A cancels a requisition
                       because the item has a Constant Reject
                       Code assigned, it will automatically update
                       the document number information visible
                       on the IUTV screen to reflect this narrative
                       text.
                       2.1. Narrative text will not be applied to

   11.3.2. Manager Review Codes (MRC). D035A works on the management-by-exception
   principle which allows the system to process the maximum number of requisitions and
   accountable transactions with minimal intervention. Use of MRCs allows IMs the ability to
   exercise selected degrees of management control when specific circumstances warrant
   interruption of automatic requisition processing. The following prescribes the basics for
   authorizing, establishing/adding, controlling (changing, deleting, downgrading and
   modifying) MRCs. It also provides MRC review and reporting requirements.
       11.3.2.1. D035A-Assigned MRCs. It is mandatory for D035A to automatically assign an
       MRC to some items as shown in Table 11.2.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                  509




Table 11.2. D035A-Assigned MRCs
Category              Details
Classified Items      D035A assigns MRC “L” to items governed by special security
                      regulations and procedures related to warehouse storage safeguards,
                      proper protection during shipment, conducting inventory, etc. Classified
                      items are identified by CIIC A through H, K, L, S and T. D035A online
                      screens display these values in fields labeled ‘Scty Class’ and ‘Sec Cd’.
Complete Personnel D035A assigns MRC “P” to all complete personnel parachutes for control
Parachutes         and issue to selected activities. Personnel parachutes are not bulk stored
                   in ‘packed’ condition and may need to be packed prior to issue. Receipt
                   of a requisition for a personnel parachute notifies the IM via generation of
                   a “9A” controlled exception that they might need to request packaging of
                   additional parachutes.
Cryptologic Items     D035A assigns MRC “L” to all cryptologic items.
with Budget Code
‘K’
Positive Inventory    D035A assigns MRC “L” to items requiring serial number tracking as part
Control (PIC)         of maintaining PIC (e.g., items identified as NWRM). These items are
                      also assigned management code ‘M’ upon which D035A keys to identify
                      PIC items for automated assignment of MRC ‘L’.
Support Equipment     D035A assigns MRC “L” to all centrally procured SE items (ERRC codes
(SE) Items            “S” and “U”). Generally, wholesale stock is not maintained for SE items;
                      rather, these items are procured to support specific requirements. Use of
                      MRC “L” enables the IM to ensure only authorized requisitions are filled
                      by manually validating requisitions against the AFEMS authorization.
Time Compliance       D035A assigns a MRC “L” to kit items which are identified by a “K” in rp
Technical Order       five of the NSN.

       11.3.2.2. Manually-Assigned MRCs. Because the assignment of an MRC prevents
       normal automatic requisition processing in D035A, frugal application of these codes is
       required. IMs must be aware that assignment of a restrictive MRC could adversely affect
       customer support, places additional manual workload on them and reduces the overall
       effectiveness of D035A. The IM will use the standardized MRC narrative template to
       properly document the circumstances surrounding MRC assignment. See Table 11.3 for
       guidance in mandatory and optional manual assignment of MRCs.

Critical Safety Item   1. Assignment of MRC “A” is mandatory but not under automatic
(CSI)                  program control to allow for flexibility of items migrating in and out of
                       safety of flight status.
                       2. IMs will assign MRC “A” to true critical safety of flight items to
                       which Critical Hardness Code ‘E’ or ‘F’ applies.
                       3. Prior to assignment of MRC “A” and although it may vary per item,
                       it is very important that the IM know all the following:

                       safety of flight risk (e.g., the Program Manager).

                       critical safety of flight risk.
                       4. Use of MRC “A” is both allowed and mandatory only if all of the
                       following are true:
                       4.1. There is a known or suspected form/fit/function deficiency with
                       any population of the item inventory which could potentially present a
                       risk to safety of flight.
                       4.2. A Critical Hardness Code of ‘E’ or ‘F’ is currently assigned or in
                       the process of being assigned to the item.

                       Volume 11 are not performed by an automated CSI tracking system.
                       4.4. Either AF is the PICA on the item or AF is the SICA and the
                       OS/A PICA requires the AF SICA to review requisitions prior to
                       passing them to the PICA. The AF SICA IM will assume the OS/A
                       PICA requires AF SICA review of requisitions on CSI items prior to
                       passing them to the PICA unless the AF SICA IM has a written waiver
                       from the OS/A PICA for the specified item. Note: This is especially
                       true if AF is SICA for an item to which NIMSC 5 procedures apply.

                       MRC “A” from items to which Critical Hardness Code E or F is not
                       currently assigned or in the process of being assigned.
Reliability            1. Assignment of MRC “W” is mandatory but not under automatic
Improvement            program control for flexibility in the RIW program.
Warranty (RIW) Items   2. IAW Chapter 6, the IM must update RIMCS information on items
                       for which all assets are subject to RIW. RIW items must reflect
                       RIMCS control code G, project code 390 and the applicable RIW
                       contractor DoDAAC in the ‘Ship-To Site 1’. The IM must also update
                       the D035A MRC and must assure update is made to the D035K
                       Maintenance Repair Code (D035K MRC) as follows:
                       2.1. IMs will manually assign D035A MRC “W” to all RIW items
                       concurrent with the assignment of RIMCS Control Code G in RAMP.
                       Receipt of a requisition for an item that contains a D035A MRC “W”
                       item will generate a “9I” (Reliability Warranty Request) controlled
                       exception. This “9I” controlled exception allows the IM to
                       cancel/reject unauthorized RIW requisitions. The IM also must
                       remove the D035A MRC “W” whenever RIMCS Control Code G is
                       deleted from the NSN items record.
                       2.2. The IM must work through either the local D035K System OPR
                       or the applicable RIM to have the D035K Maintenance Repair Code
                       (D035K MRC) set to G for items concurrent with the assignment of
                       RIMCS Control Code ‘G’ in RAMP. For items with D035K MRC
                       “G,” the system automatically directs shipment of unserviceable items
                       turned in by depot maintenance shops to RIW contractor repair
                       facilities for warranty repair or replacement. The IM must also work
                       through either the local D035K System OPR or the applicable RIM to
                       have D035K MRC “G” removed whenever RIMCS Control Code ‘G’
                       is deleted from the NSN items record.
TCTO Items (excludes   1. Assignment of MRC “T” is mandatory.
kits)                  2. IMs will manually assign MRC “T” to all items that require
                       modification.
                       3. This code provides the means of controlling the receipt and issue of
                       such items to ensure the technical order is complied with and to
                       preclude the issue of items that could jeopardize life and/or safety of
                       flight.
                       4. Upon completion of the action required in the technical order, MRC
                       “T” must be deleted.

Delivery System        which are design-unique for a nuclear weapon delivery system, but
                       which do not meet the criteria for being deemed classified or NWRM.
                       3. In all cases, the IM will use the standardized MRC narrative
                       template (that is automatically inserted by D035A when a restrictive
                       MRC is assigned) to properly document the circumstances surrounding
                       MRC assignment. The ‘Reason Restricted’ section of the template will
                       clearly state ‘Control of Design Unique to a Nuclear Weapon Delivery
                       System Item’.
                       4. The use of MRC “L” for these low usage items provides an added
                       level of control to mitigate the possibility of shipment to unauthorized
                       activities, without a significant impact to the operational mission.
Ammunition/Explosive 1. Assignment of MRC “L” is optional.
Items                2. The IM will assign a MRC “L” for ammunition/explosive items
                     with ICP RIC FGZ, FSC 1300 or MMAC AQ, NM or ES.
                       3. In all cases, the IM will use the standardized MRC narrative

                       MRC is assigned) to properly document the circumstances surrounding
                       MRC assignment. The “Reason Restricted” section of the template
                       will clearly state “Control of Ammunition/Explosive Item.”
                       4. Although Air Force requisitions for ammunitions/explosives will be
                       worked in the CAS system, assignment of a MRC “L” in D035A
                       provides an additional level of control to ensure the unauthorized
                       shipment of an ammunition/explosive item to a base supply or
                       unauthorized activity does not occur resulting in a safety violation.
                       5. The Global Ammunition Control Point (GACP) at Hill AFB will
                       resolve any issues associated with MRC assignment on
                       ammunition/explosive items.
Allocation Control     1. Assignment of MRC “L” is optional.
Items                  2. Upon request from Lead Command or AFSC activity, the IM may
                       manually assign a MRC “L” and will use the standardized MRC
                       narrative template (that is automatically inserted by D035A when a
                       restrictive MRC is assigned) to properly document the circumstances
                       surrounding the MRC assignment.
                       2.1. The Reason Restricted section of the template will clearly state
                       “Allocation Control,” identify the supportability issue(s) requiring
                       MRC load and identify the requesting activity.
                       2.2. The remaining sections of the MRC narrative template are self-
                       explanatory and will be filled out completely.

                         sequence of AF requirements due to severe supportability anomalies
                         requiring the prudent allocation of limited spares.
                         4. As the enterprise face to the customer, the 635 SCOW will facilitate
                         discussions as required on release sequence prioritization.
                         5. Lead Commands resolve disagreements between supply chain
                         activities in regards to spares release prioritization.
                         6. The 635 SCOW may also challenge the use of MRC “L” if
                         assignment is deemed to not be in the best interest of the warfighter
                         based on the MRC narrative text.
                         7. The 448 SCMW will resolve any disagreements between supply
                         chain activities in regards to MRC “L” applicability for reasons other
                         than release prioritization.
Other Serialized         1. Assignment of MRC “S” is optional.
Controlled Items         2. The IM may manually assign MRC “S” to serialized controlled
                         items (excludes PIC items) when authorized.
                         3. In all cases, the IM will use the standardized MRC narrative
                         template (that is automatically inserted by D035A when a restrictive
                         MRC is assigned) to properly document the circumstances surrounding
                         MRC assignment. The “Reason Restricted” section of the template
                         will clearly state “Other Serialized Control Item.”
                         4. All actions to support requisitions for these items must be processed
                         off-line.
                         4.1. D035A will not place requisitions on “B5” BO because BOs must
                         be released via “O1” release action to generate a shipping request.
                         4.2. The IM must also contact the shipper to provide the serial number
                         of the item to be shipped.

Table 11.4. MRC Manual Assignment and Documentation Steps
Step Category              Instructions
1      Review MRC          Prior to the assignment of an MRC, an IM must review the MRC
       Assignment &        Assignment & Retention Decision List and become thoroughly
       Retention           acquainted with the associated logic processes in D035A. Consider
       Worksheet           the establishment and use of stock levels as described in paragraph
                           11.3.3 as part of MRC selection. Routine control checks made by
                           D035A during requisition processing are designed to reduce the
                           need for restrictive MRCs.
2      Select MRC and      Once the IM has determined that manual assignment of a MRC is
       Obtain Supervisor   required/authorized, s/he will select the least restrictive MRC that
       Approval            will provide the necessary control and obtain first-level supervisor
                           approval for restrictive MRCs (other than “T” and “X”). Note: First
                           level supervisor approval is also required for renewal of restrictive
                           MRC assignment.
3      File Maintain       The IM will then assign the MRC to the NSN through the use of a
       MRC                 “ZFB” file maintenance transaction via the D035A MIRC screen as
                           shown in paragraph 13.17.7. Note: File maintenance of any MRC
                           (other than “S” or “T”) to any item in an I&SG will cause all items
                           in the group to be assigned the same MRC.1. Narrative Text and
                           Review Date. At the time an IM assigns a MRC to a NSN, D035A
                           prompts for input of both narrative text explaining why the
                           assignment is being made and a review date. The review date
                           cannot be less than 45 days or greater than 180 days in the future.
                           D035A will not allow MRC assignment to continue until the
                           narrative text and review date are provided. When changing from
                           one MRC to another, the IM must also review and update the
                           narrative text and review date. The narrative text format is
                           mandatory for assignment of MRC “L” and recommended for
                           assignment of any restrictive MRC. It is important that the narrative
                           text be detailed in nature because customers can access D035A web
                           inquiry or the mainframe to obtain requisition status, item
                           management information and MRC narrative text.
                           2. MRC “X” Standard Narrative Text. D035A will automatically
                           insert standardized text for items manually assigned MRC “X” as
                           follows: “For manager review only. Non-restrictive code. No
                           stock rationing.”
                           3. MRC “L” Standard Narrative Text. D035A will automatically
                           insert standardized text for system-assigned MRC “L” items. This
                           text must be replaced with the standardized MRC narrative template
                           to properly document the circumstances surrounding manual MRC

        11.3.2.3.2. Visibility and follow-on procedures:
            11.3.2.3.2.1. Visibility. Narrative text for a manually-assigned MRC is visible
            via multiple applications. See Chapter 1 for details regarding gaining access to
            the following applications:
                11.3.2.3.2.1.1. Access D035A BOA_, DOD_, ISG_ and NSN_ screens. If
                MRC narrative text is available, there will be a notice that data can be viewed
                by pressing the F10 key. Note: Narrative text for mechanically-assigned
                MRCs is also visible here.
                11.3.2.3.2.1.2. Access SCS Midtier. Click on the “Items” button. Select
                “Interrogations” and “Stock Number Interrogation” from the drop down
                menu. Interrogate by NIIN/NSN.

                Interrogate by NIIN/NSN.
            11.3.2.3.2.2. Update Narrative Text. IMs can update the narrative text for
            manually-assigned MRCs via the D035A MIRC screen. This screen allows the
            user to add to existing data or completely rewrite the narrative text. Note: When
            the MRC is removed or changed through file maintenance, the narrative text will
            drop from the record automatically.
            11.3.2.3.2.3. Item Transfer. Items transferred from one Center to another will
            carry the MRC and the narrative text that was associated with the NSN at the time
            of transfer.
     11.3.2.4. D035A processes requisitions on items with an MRC as shown in Table 11.5.

        2.1. If the requisition contains a fill-or-kill advice code (22, 2C, 2J, 31, 32, 33, 6K or
        6Z), D035A will reject it with status code CB.
        2.2. If the requisition does not contain a fill-or-kill advice code, D035A will BO it with
        status code BB.
        3. For a requisition not automatically released for shipment, D035A will either
        suspend it on a “9A” controlled exception (for requisitions with a fill-or-kill advice
        code) or place it on “B5” BO.
L       1. Requisitions with a Fill or Kill Advice code are suspended on “9A” controlled
        exceptions.
        2. Requisitions with no Fill or Kill Advice code are placed on “B5” BO.
P       Suspend the requisition on a “9A” controlled exception.
S       1. Attempt to ship assets to fill any programmed requisition.
        2. If D035A receives a denial against the release for shipment, the system will place
        the requisition on “BB” BO.
T       Suspend the requisition on a “9A” controlled exception.
W       1. Generate a “9I” controlled exception that is output to the IM for manager action.
        2. Because the IM is expected to have knowledge of all authorized RIW requirements,
        the “9I” controlled exception will allow the IM to reject unauthorized RIW
        requisitions.
X       1. Attempt to ship assets to fill any programmed requisition.
        2. If D035A receives a denial against the release for shipment, the system will place
        the requisition on “BB” BO.
Notes   1. If the items record contains Lean Logistics code L or M, which indicates the item is
        redistributed via EXPRESS logic, D035A will ignore the MRC and stock control levels
        assigned to the item when attempting to release assets.
        2. When an MRC is changed or deleted and BOs exist, D035A will automatically

        11.3.2.5. Review Requirements for MRC Items. IMs must closely monitor items with
        manually-assigned MRCs other than “X” to determine whether appropriate MRCs are
        assigned. As circumstances change for an item, an IM must initiate appropriate MRC
        adjustments (i.e., deletion, application of a less restrictive MRC or application of a more
        restrictive MRC). For items maintaining a manually-assigned MRC, an IM must ensure
        MRC narrative text is accurate, concise and updated timely. Triggers for review are
        provided in Table 11.6.

                      maintained for items assigned MRC “S”. See paragraph 5.4.3 for
                      processing details.
Periodic MRC          IMs must perform a periodic review of all items with manually-

                      using the MRC Assignment & Retention Decision List.
                      1. The following applies to all items with manually-assigned MRCs
                      of D, E, F or L:
                      1.1. Thirty days prior to the expiration of the item “Manager
                      Review Date” visible on the MIRC screen, D035A generates a
                      notice titled “MRC Review Date Expires In 30 Days.” The IM will
                      remove, change or validate the continued need for the assigned
                      MRC. For items that continue to require a restrictive MRC, the IM
                      will review the narrative text to ensure it is current, concise and
                      complete.
                      1.2. If no action is taken to delete or change the MRC within 15
                      days after the notice is generated, D035A will generate a “7R”
                      controlled exception titled “Update MRC Review Date.” It is not
                      possible to delete this controlled exception; rather, the IM must
                      work this controlled exception within 15 days in one of three ways
                      as follows (see also Chapter 8):
                      1.2.1. Retain the Current MRC. The IM must wait for the 7R
                      exception to set the “Manager Review Date” to no less than 45 days
                      and no more than 180 days from current date. The narrative can be
                      updated via the MIRC or the 7R exception.
                      1.2.2. Change the MRC to D, E, F or L. The IM must update the
                      MRC narrative text and set the “Manager Review Date” to no less
                      than 45 days and no more than 180 days from current date.
                      1.2.3. Change the MRC to A, P, S, T, W or a space. If the MRC is
                      changed to a space, D035A will remove the MRC from the NSN.
                      1.3. If no action is taken on the “7R” controlled exception prior to
                      expiration of the “Manager Review Date,” D035A will
                      automatically delete the “7R” controlled exception and downgrade
                      the MRC by one level from the current MRC (i.e., MRC “L” will be

                           2. For items with manually-assigned MRCs of A, P, S, T or W, the
                           IM will set a personal reminder to perform an annual MRC review.
                           The IM will remove, change or validate the continued need for the
                           assigned MRC. For items that continue to require a restrictive
                           MRC, the IM will review the narrative text to ensure it is current,
                           concise and complete.
                           Note: The following MRCs will not be mechanically downgraded:

         Report            applying MRC management oversight. The report contains
                           information for all items having a change in MRC during that
                           month. The four reports produced each month are placed on the
                           SCS Midtier with the following categories: FD2020 for Hill-

  11.3.3. Stock Control Levels.
     11.3.3.1. Utilization of Stock Control Levels. Stock control levels’ processing occurs
     after MRC processing, so a requisition that is forced on “B5” BO is not subjected to
     levels processing. Refer to paragraph 11.2 for MRC processing.
         11.3.3.1.1. Forced shipments using action codes V1, V3, V4, V7, V8, VD, O1 or O2
         are not subjected to levels processing; however, levels processing is performed for
         forced shipments using action codes V5, V6 or V9. Refer to Chapter 3 for details
         regarding forced shipments and the various action codes.
         11.3.3.1.2. Control levels, Support levels and Critical Support levels (automatically
         set equal to one-third of the support level rounded up to the nearest whole number)
         are assigned to a stock number to assist the IM with managing and controlling the
         release of materiel. These levels provide a means of restricting the automatic
         shipment of materiel. Based on certain criteria (i.e., priority designator, project code,
         RDD, advice code and type of customer), a requisition being considered for release
         by the system is compared to a specific level. If shipping materiel to fill the

         requisition would reduce the current on-hand balance below the level, the release
         action is stopped and the requisition is placed on BO. It is important to note that a
         programmed requisition, with one of the following characteristics, is not subjected to
         the levels processing described in this chapter:
             11.3.3.1.2.1. The priority designator is 01, 02 or 03.
             11.3.3.1.2.2. The RDD begins with “N” or equals “999.”
             11.3.3.1.2.3. The project code begins with “9.”
             11.3.3.1.2.4. The Lean Logistics code for the stock number requisitioned is “L”
             or “M.”
         11.3.3.1.3. To try and prevent the automatic release of materiel before valid levels
         can be established for a new stock number, the system defaults the control level,
         support level and critical support level to “9,999,999.” This maximum level quantity
         stays in effect until a valid level overlay transaction is received from the D200A
         system or the IM submits DIC ZFL through the D035A MIRD menu option.
             11.3.3.1.3.1. In order to ensure proper logistics support, the wholesale IM must
             receive concurrence from their first level supervisor before changing the D200A
             computed control level, support level, or locking the level with a Level Control
             Code “L” through the use of the MIRD menu option. Supporting documentation
             for these changes must be maintained in the IM files for as long as the manually
             established levels remain in effect.
             11.3.3.1.3.2. To prevent the next feed of D200A data from overlaying IM manual
             input, the IM can lock the Control and Support Level by file maintaining Level
             Control Code L.
             11.3.3.1.3.3. To once again allow the feed of D200A data to overlay what an IM
             manually file maintained and which has been locked, the IM can unlock the
             Control and Support Level by file maintaining Level Control Code U.
             11.3.3.1.3.4. File maintenance of Support Level, Control Level and Level Control
             Code is accomplished via DIC ZFL as shown in paragraph 13.17.8.
      11.3.3.2. D035A does not receive any levels data for equipment (ERRC “S” and “U”)
      stock numbers; therefore, the wholesale IM must manually maintain levels on equipment
      items, if required. However, since the purpose of levels is to control the automatic
      release of assets and since requisitions for equipment items must be manually released,
      there is no reason for an equipment stock number to have levels data. If processing DIC
      ZFL results in a decrease in either the control level or support level quantity, a RBO
      transaction is processed to potentially release assets to fill a BO.
      11.3.3.3. Using Levels Data.
         11.3.3.3.1. Levels data is applied anytime a requisition transaction (e.g., a new
         requisition or a requisition modifier) is processed by D035A for possible automatic
         release (e.g., the MRC did not force a “B5” BO) and the requisition is not exempt
         (see paragraph 11.3.48.1.1.2 and 11. 3.48.1.2) from the levels check.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                 521


       11.3.3.3.2. The system selects the appropriate level (control, support or critical
       support) to use as follows:
          11.3.3.3.2.1. The control level is selected for the following types of requisitions:
              11.3.3.3.2.1.1. A FMS or Grant Aid requisition with management code 2.
              11.3.3.3.2.1.2. A requisition from a non-AF S/A where the S/A is not a
              registered user of the stock number (i.e., a non-programmed requisition).
              11.3.3.3.2.1.3. A requisition with a project code 3AA, which indicates a
              requisition of consumable materiel in support of a pre-positioned war reserve
              materiel requirement.
              11.3.3.3.2.1.4. An aggregation account requisition from the SSSC system.
              Refer to Chapter 7 for details concerning SSSC aggregation account
              processing.
          11.3.3.3.2.2. If the control level was not selected, the system uses the priority
          designator, project code, RDD and advice code from the requisition transaction to
          compute a critical release sequence category. This number is compared to the
          “B5” BO threshold for MRC “D,” which can be viewed through the “Backorder
          Release Sequence Criteria” web page found under the TABLES menu on the
          Stock        Control        System        web         application     found        at
          https://scsapps.day.disa.mil/afhome/ . If this number is greater than or equal to
          the MRC “D” threshold number, which currently is set to “218,” the support level
          is selected; otherwise, the critical support level is selected. For example, since a
          requisition with priority designator 05 and with a RDD beginning with “E” is
          assigned a critical release sequence category of “179,” the critical support level is
          used for this type of requisition. On the other hand, since a requisition with
          priority designator 04, with no project code, with a numeric RDD not equal to
          “999” and project code 122 is assigned a critical release sequence category of
          “222,” the support level is used for this type of requisition.
       11.3.3.3.3. The levels check is as follows:
          11.3.3.3.3.1. The total number of serviceable assets on-hand is computed.
          11.3.3.3.3.2. The selected level is subtracted from the total number of serviceable
          assets on-hand to determine the total number of assets available for automatic
          release.
          11.3.3.3.3.3. If the total number of assets available for automatic release is zero
          or negative, the requisition is placed on BO.
          11.3.3.3.3.4. If the total number of assets available for automatic release is
          greater than zero, but less than the requisitioned quantity, the quantity available is
          processed for possible shipment on the current suffix code and the remaining
          balance is placed on BO on the next available suffix code.
          11.3.3.3.3.5. If the total number of assets available for automatic release is
          greater than or equal to the requisitioned quantity, the requisitioned quantity is
          processed for possible shipment.
 522                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


          11.3.3.3.4. Before beginning the asset selection process, the system compares the
          critical release sequence category for the requisition being processed for automatic
          release against any other existing BOs for the same stock number. If a higher priority
          BO (based on critical release sequence categories) is found, then the requisition being
          processed is placed on BO. For example, if the highest priority BO for a given stock
          number is pre-positioned for release based on a turn-in from maintenance, then no
          lower priority BO for that given stock number can be automatically released for
          shipment by D035A.
       11.3.3.4. Levels on Interchangeable and Substitutable (I&S) Group Families. Level
       checks on I&S Group families are accomplished as follows:
          11.3.3.4.1. D200A computes the support and control levels for the subgroup master
          items in the I&S Group family, so only a subgroup master item will have control,
          support and critical support levels assigned in D035A.
          11.3.3.4.2. For each subgroup within an I&S Group family, the asset position of all
          items within the subgroup is compared to the appropriate level (control, support or
          critical support) from the subgroup master item. This calculation is used to determine
          a positive (on-hand assets are greater than the level), negative (on-hand assets are less
          than the level) or zero (on-hand assets equal the level) value for the subgroup.
          11.3.3.4.3. A positive value for a subgroup is not used in the levels computation if it
          belongs to a subgroup positioned above the requisitioned item in an I&S Group. For
          example, a positive value for subgroup AB is not used if the requisition is for an item
          in subgroup AC. A negative value, though, is used in the levels computation
          regardless of its position within the I&S Group family.
          11.3.3.4.4. The applicable positive values and all the negative values are combined.
          If the resulting number is negative, the requisition is placed on BO; otherwise, an
          attempt to fill the requisition is made. For example, if an I&S Group family has four
          subgroups where subgroup AA has a negative value of “20,” subgroup AB has a
          positive value of “20,” subgroup AC has a positive value of “5” and subgroup AD has
          a positive value of “10,” a requisition for an “AC” or “AD” stock number results in a
          BO, while a requisition for an “AA” or “AB” stock number results in a shipment
          attempt.
11.4. Deleting an Item Record.
   11.4.1. The standard process for deleting an item out of D035 is for the Wholesale IM to use
   D143C to change the AAC in D043 to “Y.” This causes an overlay to D035 who then checks
   dozens of internal databases to determine if D035 can in fact delete the item. D035 will not
   delete an NSN if assets, base levels, backorders, financial records or other D035 subsystems
   users exist for the item. Then and only then, D035 will set the SOS-CD to “JCD.”
   11.4.2. If D035 has not yet deleted the item, request a D035A Site Functional OPR use Data
   Query as shown in Table 11.7 to identify whether there are D035 databases that still require
   use of the item.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                   523


Table 11.7. Data Query to Check for D035 Databases Using an Item
Step Action
1     Use the “EDIT” option to view a query named “TEMPNSN.”
2     Change the query name to something you will remember and then press the “PF4” key to
      save it.
3     On line 04, change the data to reflect the NSN you wish to query.
4     On line 06, change the data to your government E-mail address.
5     Press the “PF9” key to update your query.
6     To the right of the => prompt at the top of the screen, type “SUB.”
7     Change “ACTIVE-QUERY” to the query name you established in Step 2; change the JCL
      name from “$$DQJCL” to “ATTACH”; press the “PF3” key. The screen will come back
      with a message that says something like “DQ412I — Your Job Was Submitted at 10:27.”
8     Allow several minutes for an E-mail to reach its destination and then check your
      government E-mail inbox for a computer-generated message having a text file attachment.
      Do not be concerned that the “From” address includes text such as "–error—5.1.2˜‘553
      percent hack not allowed. On behalf of NSHCZ4C@MTS.CSD.DISA.MIL.”

      11.4.2.1. If the message in the attached text file reads “NSN Okay to Delete,” give this
      information to a D035A AFMC Lead Functional OPR who can in-turn request someone
      from the SCS PMO to run a job which will delete the item from D035.
      11.4.2.2. If the message in the attached text file indicates assets remain on-record:
          11.4.2.2.1. Use the text file query to identify items for which AF is SICA and it
          would be appropriate to send DIC FTE to the PICA. Use the D035A AUXD screen
          to submit the report of excess .
          11.4.2.2.2. Use the NEW screen with “A0A”/”VD” action to send assets to disposal,
          but only if the applicable DEMIL code, SCC, etc. allows for disposal (see paragraph
          13.8.6.2). AF personnel need to work with their local disposal counterparts.
              11.4.2.2.2.1. If the DEMIL code in D035 does not match what is on the DSS
              record, request a D035A AFMC Lead or Site Functional OPR ask SCS PMO
              personnel to adjust the D035 record to match the DSS record; if that is all that is
              preventing disposal, users can then take disposal action.
              11.4.2.2.2.2. If suspended SCCs apply, ICP personnel must work through their
              local DLA POCs to have these SCCs changed and then the user can take disposal
              action.
      11.4.2.3. If the message in the attached text file indicates any other database(s) requiring
      use of the item, consult with a D035A Site Functional OPR for further action (e.g.,
      removing erroneous due-ins, due-outs, etc.).

                                         Chapter 12

                   AFLCMC/HN, CRYPTO SYSTEMS, PROCEDURES

12.1. Overview. The processes covered in this chapter apply to AFLCMC/HN located at
Lackland AFB, TX and pertain to D035A’s systemic/operational relationship with the
AFLCMC/HN stock control data system (Cryptologic Depot Accountability System [CDAS]).
   12.1.1. CDAS is a multi-user personal computer-based software package used to handle
   AFLCMC/HN’s inventory management and mission supportability needs. It provides
   automated, real-time capability to control and account for all categories of assets.
   12.1.2. CDAS facilitates stock, store and issue of wholesale IM accountable materiel
   physically located at AFLCMC/HN depot storage site (RIC F3T/DODAAC FB2307). CDAS
   transactions are constructed in standard MILSTRIP format to enable communication with
   D035A.
   12.1.3. For AFLCMC/HN-managed items, CDAS accomplishes the combined stock control
   functions performed by D035K and DSS for items managed by the other three AFMC IPCs.
12.2. Requisitions. Customer requirements for AFLCM/HN-managed assets are submitted via
normal D035A requisitioning procedures (see Chapter 3). When the IM releases assets for
shipment to support a customer requisition, the resulting “A5_” MRO transaction routes through
DAAS to CDAS.
   12.2.1. CDAS prints a DD Form 1348-1A disposition document which the warehouseman
   uses to retrieve the requested materiel from stock. The materiel is then packaged and
   delivered to AFLCMC/HN’s transportation office for further processing.
   12.2.2. AFLCMC/HN transportation office personnel will input associated requisition
   transaction data into CMOS, which in turn sends shipment confirmations to CDAS. CDAS
   then sends DIC AR_ back to D035A for update of the document control file.
12.3. Receipts. CDAS updates accountable balance records based on receipt of materiel via
new procurement, contract repair, serviceable asset relocation or as unserviceable returns from
customers. Receipts trigger CDAS to automatically route DIC D4_ or D6_ via DAAS to D035A
for update of memo balance records. See Chapter 5 for further details.
12.4. Inventory Adjustments. Inventory adjustments made to CDAS accountable balances
(i.e., DIC D8_ increases or D9_ decreases) are routed through DAAS to D035A for adjustment
of its memo balance records. See Chapter 5 for further information detailing wholesale asset
balances.
12.5. CDAS Interfaces. CDAS sends and receives MILSTRIP transaction data daily from
DAAS every 15 minutes for the data systems shown in Table 12.1.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                              525

   13.2.4. Sample Format Tables.             Each sample format contains a table with
   recommended/required entries for each data element. The last row of each table gives
   additional information about that table. Common to many of these tables are: The presence
   of an asterisk (*) before the field name indicates entry is required prior to using the “Enter”
   key for the first time; the presence of a plus sign (+) before the field name indicates change
   of the field value is allowed before using the “Enter” key the first time; the presence of a
   circumflex (^) before the field name indicates change of the field value is either allowed or
   required after using the “Enter” key for the first time (e.g., in Table 13.16, only the value for
   “Enter New Action” is required prior to using the “Enter” key for the first time; change is
   required to the value in the ASI Contract No field after using the “Enter” key for the first
   time; and the value in the ESD field may either be changed or retained as-is after using the
   “Enter” key for the first time).

Section 13B—Order Management.

13.3. Input New Requisition.
   13.3.1. P/N (DIC A0B or A02). If required parts are neither stock listed nor obtainable
   through Local Purchase/Local Manufacture, AFMC ICP P/N processors use the PTN screen

   and follow procedures found in Chapter 4, to put P/N requisitions into D035A (only if the
   P/N is less than or equal to 10 digits). When a manufacturer’s P/N exceeds 10 digits, the
   materiel will instead be requisitioned on DD Form 1348-6. Note: Customer is responsible
   for providing Processors with valid information to be used for manual input of P/N
   requisitions into D035A. Reference Table 13.4.

by reviewing the DoDAAC in the first six positions of the requisition document number. The
IM can obtain the customer’s address by cross-referencing this DoDAAC to the Transportation
Account Code (TAC) 1 DoDAAC on the DLA Transaction Services website at
https://dls.daas.dla.mil/edaasinq/daasinq_dodaaf_menu.asp or the AF DoDAAC Web

            delivery shipment has not already occurred and that it can be stopped. If this is not
            done, the shipment will be made and D035A will not be able to process DIC ZK_,
            shipment confirmation transaction. This creates errors in the financial systems;
            therefore it will be avoided. If the intent is to fill a high priority BO with status code
            BZ or BV from materiel in stock and cancellation of the direct delivery shipment
            cannot confirmed, consider using a manager-forced shipment requisition to “push”
            the materiel to the customer.
            13.4.3.8.2. It is important to understand that DIC ZP_ does not create a BO with
            status code B5. So to ensure the requisition is not automatically processed for
            release, use “B4” in the “Change of Status” field.
    13.4.4. Pass/Refer (DIC AC3). Closely follow guidance in paragraph 3.4.2.2.2.3 in
    deciding whether to manually pass or refer a backordered requisition to an alternator ICP.
    Use D035A BOAB screen. Reference Table 13.24.

        13.4.4.3. When passing/referring an AF requisition, change the signal code and FC as
        follows:
            13.4.4.3.1. Signal Code.
                 13.4.4.3.1.1. If the signal code is “D” indicating shipment to the DoDAAC in the
                 first six positions of the document number and no billing is required, change the
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                  575


              signal code to “A.” Signal code A indicates the asset will be shipped and billed to
              the customer identified by the document number DoDAAC.
              13.4.4.3.1.2. If the signal code is “M” indicating shipment to the SUPADD and
              no billing is required, change the signal code to “J.” Signal code J indicates the
              asset will be shipped to the customer identified by the SUPADD DoDAAC and
              billed to the customer in the document number.
              13.4.4.3.1.3. If AF is the SICA wholesale IM for the NSN using NIMSC 5
              procedures and the signal code is “D” indicating shipment to the DoDAAC in the
              first six positions of the document number and no billing is required, change the
              signal code to “C.” Signal code C indicates the asset will be shipped to the
              customer identified by the document number DoDAAC and the account related to
              the requisition FC will be billed.
              13.4.4.3.1.4. If AF is the SICA wholesale IM for the NSN using NIMSC 5
              procedures and the signal code is “M” indicating shipment to the SUPADD and
              no billing required, change the signal code to “L.” Signal code L indicates that
              the asset will be shipped to the customer identified by the SUPADD DoDAAC
              and the account related to the requisition fund code will be billed.
           13.4.4.3.2. Fund Code.
              13.4.4.3.2.1. If NIMSC 5 applies, change the first position of the Fund Code to an
              alpha code indicating the processing Center: ‘P’ for AFLCMC/HN; ‘H’ for
              Tinker; ‘G’ for Hill and ‘L’ for Robins. Also, change the second position of the
              FC to indicate the Budget Code of the NSN in the requisition that is being passed
              as shown in Table 13.25.
              13.4.4.3.2.2. If non-NIMSC 5 applies, use the corresponding Fund Code found in
              Table 13.25.

Note: Action codes ‘O2’, ‘V3’, ‘V7’, ‘V9’ and ‘VD’ are used to relocate assets for reasons other
than filling requisitions. See paragraphs 13.8.6 and 13.11.4.

        13.4.5.1. User Decides Storage Site. The user must also decide whether to bypass
        Control and Support Levels (see paragraph 3.4.2.3).
            13.4.5.1.1. Use ‘O1’ action code if assets are in ownership code ‘9’ at an AF depot
            (e.g., ‘FLB’) or are in an SBSS account (e.g., ‘FB4610’).
            13.4.5.1.2. Use ‘V1’ action code if assets are in purpose code ‘A’ at a non-AF depot
            (e.g., ‘AN5’).
        13.4.5.2. Computer Decides Storage Site. Although the following are valid, use of ‘O1’
        and ‘V1’ action codes are actually sufficient for releasing assets for shipment to support
        customer orders.
            13.4.5.2.1. Use action code ‘V4’ if release action is for the item requested and
            D035A is allowed to bypass Control and Support Levels.
            13.4.5.2.2. Use action code ‘V5’ if release action is for the item requested and
            D035A is not allowed to bypass Control and Support Levels.
            13.4.5.2.3. Use action code ‘V6’ if release action is for an alternate item to the one
            requested and D035A is not allowed to bypass Control and Support Levels.
            13.4.5.2.4. Use action code ‘V8’ if release action is for an alternate item to the one
            requested and D035A is allowed to bypass Control and Support Levels.

Section 13C—Manage Assets.

13.8. AF Depot/Collocated. Assets are located at ‘FGB’, ‘FHB’ or ‘FLB’ in ownership code
‘9’ at the same site where the items are managed (e.g., the assets are stored at ‘FLB’ and the item
is managed by ‘FLZ’). See Chapter 5 for applicable procedures.
    13.8.1. Change SCC. This is not allowed for AF depot asset balances. The wholesale IM
    will contact the collocated D035K RIM to initiate this change which will trigger an overlay
    to D035A.
    13.8.2. Change Quantity. This is not allowed for AF Depot asset balances. The wholesale
    IM will contact the collocated D035K RIM to initiate this change which will trigger an
    overlay to D035A. Note: Although the OVRC screen appears to still allow update of
    Reserve and Operating Account Balances (aka R & O Balances) via an ‘XBG’ transaction,
    those balances are no longer maintained.
    13.8.3. Change O/P Code (‘DAD’). This is only allowed for movement of AF Depot asset
    balances into O/P ‘K’ when the assets are physically located at the same site where the item
    is managed. Reference Table 13.48. For any other change in O/P Code, the IM will contact
    the collocated D035K RIM to initiate this change which will trigger an overlay to D035A.

    13.8.4. Request Overlay. The IM will contact the collocated D035K RIM to initiate this
    overlay.
    13.8.5. Request Inventory. Prior to distribution authority transferring to DLA, there was a
    process to perform an inventory reconciliation between D035K (depot retail) and the
    Automated Warehouse System (AWS which acted as the local storage system at the time).
    The process used ‘DJA’ request and ‘DKA’ response transactions. It was theorized that
    wholesale IMs might need to be able to request such a reconciliation; so, such capability was
    provided via the RECG screen. This process only worked at the then five ALCs (Hill, Kelly,
    McClellan, Robins and Tinker); however, it was never a “World Wide Inventory” process.
    After DLA took over the distribution part of stock control at these sites, AWS was replaced
    with DSS. The D035K-to-AWS inventory reconciliation process ceased to exist. The RECG
    screen remains, but there is no useful functionality attached to it. It must also be reiterated
    that inventory is not a D035A process. It is a D035K/L process.
    13.8.6. Relocate. Use D035A NEW screen.

  13.9.4. Change Quantity and/or SCC.
      13.9.4.1. Those with D035A System OPR access can change balances at a non-
      collocated AF Depot using the D035A OVRA screen (‘XBD’ or ‘XBI’). Resulting
      ‘XBD’ transactions change SCC A - D, F and G on-hand balances. Resulting ‘XBI’
      transactions change SCC M, 1, 2 and 3 Due-In-From Overhaul balances. Note: This
      function updates only the D035A balances, it does not overlay to D035K/DSS to
      "change" balances or SCCs. Reference Table 13.51.

Terms
Accountability— The obligation imposed by law, lawful order, or regulation, accepted by an
organization or person for keeping accurate records, to ensure control of property, documents or
funds, with or without physical possession. The obligation, in this context, refers to the fiduciary
duties, responsibilities and obligations necessary for protecting the public interest; however, it
does not necessarily impose personal liability upon an organization or person. Reference DoDI
5000.64, Accountability and Management of DoD Equipment and Other Accountable Property.
Accountable Flag— Field that identifies if a transaction is accountable.
Acquisition Advice Code— One-digit alpha code that indicates how (as distinguished from
where) and under what restrictions an item will be acquired. Reference DoD 4100.39-M,
Volume 10, Table 58.
Acquisition Method Code (AMC)— A single digit numeric code, assigned by a DoD activity,
to describe to the contracting officer and other government personnel the results of a technical
review of a part and its suitability for breakout. Reference AFI 20-106 (IP), Management of
Aviation Critical Safety Items.
Acquisition Method Suffix Code (AMSC)— A single digit alpha code, assigned by a DoD
activity, that provides the contracting officer and other government personnel with engineering,
manufacturing and technical information further describing suitability/nonsuitability for
breakout. Reference AFI 20-106 (IP).
Activity Code— A two-character code assigned by the Defense Logistics Agency Logistics
Information Service, upon request, for use in the Federal Catalog System to identify an activity
for cataloging, standardization, or other management purposes. Reference DoD 4100.39-M.
Additive Level— That authorized quantity of stock added to the demand. A subset of “special
level.”
Advice Code— Numeric/alphabetic or numeric/numeric two-position codes that provide coded
instruction to supply sources when such data are considered essential to supply action and entry
in narrative form is not feasible (rp 65-66). Reference DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.15.
Advisory and Assistance Services— Those services acquired by contract or by personnel
appointment to support or improve agency policy development, decision-making, management,
and administration, or to support or improve the operation of management systems. Such
services may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, conclusions,
recommendations, training, and direct assistance.
Agent (Depot Maintenance Interservice Support Agreement)— The Military Service
responsible for providing depot maintenance support to the Principal. Reference DLM 4000.25.

 674                                                        AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


Application— Software program that performs a specific function directly for a user and can be
executed without access to system control, monitoring or administrative privileges. Examples
include office automation, electronic mail, web services and major functional or mission
software programs. Reference DODD 8500.01E, Information Assurance (IA).
Assembly— An item forming a portion of an equipment, that can be provisioned and replaced as
an entity and which normally incorporates replaceable parts or groups of parts. Reference
DoDM 4140.01, Volume 2.
Authentication— Security measure designed to establish the validity of a transmission,
message, or originator, or a means of verifying an individual's authorization to receive specific
categories of information. Reference DODD 8500.01E.
Authorized User— Any appropriately cleared individual with a requirement to access a DoD
information system in order to perform or assist in a lawful and authorized governmental
function. Reference DODD 8500.01E.
Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) Identification Code— A one-position
identifier code to indicate an item of ADPE or containing ADPE regardless of assigned FSC to
provide visibility for compliance with unique manager requirements established for ADPE by
Public Law 89-306. This code aids DLA Disposition Services Field Offices with identifying
these items at the time they are transferred to disposal. It is referred to as the ADPE code in this
volume. References DoD 4100.39-M, Volume 10, Tables 159 and 161; and DLM 4000.25-1,
Appendix 2.24.
Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN)— A standardized worldwide automatic digital
network comprising all general data communications facilities servicing the DoD.
Aviation Critical Safety item (CSI)/Flight Safety Critical Aircraft Part (FSCAP)— An
aviation-related part, assembly, installation or production system with one or more critical or
critical safety characteristics that, if missing or not conforming to the design data, quality
requirements or overhaul and maintenance documentation, would result in an unsafe condition
that could cause loss or serious damage to the end item or major components, loss of control,
uncommanded engine shutdown or serious injury or death to personnel. Unsafe conditions relate
to hazard severity categories I and II of MIL-STD-882 and include items determined to be "life-
limited," "fracture critical," "fatigue-sensitive," etc. The determining factor in Aviation
CSI/FSCAP is the consequence of failure, not the probability that the failure or consequence
would occur. Reference DoDM 4140.01, Volume 11 and AFI 20-106 (IP).
Awaiting Parts (AWP)— Designation for a deferred discrepancy on an aircraft awaiting parts.
During the repair process for systems/equipments, parts are ordered for the system/equipment
undergoing repair or an end item is being scheduled for a repair process and parts are ordered for
a scheduled repair of the system/equipment to start the repair process. The end item
system/equipment undergoing repair/being scheduled for repair is AWP when the parts to
continue the repair process are backordered or the scheduled repair process will exceed mission
requirements. References AFI 23-101 and AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance
Management.
Backorder (BO)— An obligation, assumed and recorded by any supply echelon, to issue at a
subsequent date a requisitioned item which was not immediately available for supply.
AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014                                                                    675


Base Repair Cycle Time— A measure of the average number of days it takes to successfully
repair a recoverable item in a base repair shop. BRCT is item specific. When an item is a master
or interchangeable within an I&SG, the BRCT represents the average base repair cycle time
across all grouped items.
Base Repair Percentage— An indicator of the amount of repair activity at base level for a given
asset. It is the average base repair rate for the item over the current and past four quarters. The
retail materiel management system calculates the PBR using RTS (repaired this station), NRTS
and condemnation data from the repair cycle record. Better known as Percent of Base Repair
(PBR). References are AFH 21-130, Technical Analysis to Determine Criterion for 2 vs 3 Level
Repair, and AFI 23-101.
Batch— A sequential process procedure that uses an accumulation of data or a group of units
without any directed user interaction during processing. Typically, a set of multiple transactions
are executed as a single job unit. Batch jobs may be initiated by remote user terminals in the
communication with modernized DLIS environment, but there will be no communication with
the user during execution. Ordinarily, results will not be available to the user until the entire
batch has completed execution. The DLIS design will also allow for batch jobs to be initiated
automatically by on-line transaction if certain time parameters are exceeded. Reference DoD
4100.39-M.
Bill— A statement of the amounts owed for the transfer or sale of materiel and for the
performance of services incident to the transfer. Reference DLM 4000.25.
Budget Code— A code employed by the AF to classify items into categories by budget account
for management information purposes. Reference AFMAN 65-604, Appropriation Symbols and
Budget Codes (Fiscal Year 2013), and DoD 4100.39-M, Volume 10, Table 67.
Business Rule— A statement that defines or constrains some aspect of the business. It is
intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business.
Reference DLM 4000.25.
C-Factor— Multiplier of the standard deviation (square root of the variance) of demand during
replenishment. The supply system uses the C-factor to selectively increase item safety level
quantities for stocked items. The C-factor assignment policy is based on item mission impact,
historical demand and unit price criteria. It is an important part of the safety level quantity
calculation.
Cannibalization— Authorized removals of a specific assembly, subassembly, or part from one
weapons system, system, support system, or equipment end-item for installation on another end-
item to meet priority mission requirements with an obligation to replace the removed item.
Reference AFI 21-101.
Capitalization— The receipt or transfer in of inventories from a different fund or fund
subdivision without charge or income. The inventory increases the transferee's fund equity
(capital) directly and does not increase operational income or expense. Reference DLM 4000.25.
Carcass Cost— The value of an asset when the LRC plus BOCR have been removed from the
SP of the item. Carcass cost is also equal to the LAC minus the LRC. Reference AFI 23-101.
Carrier— Any individual, company, or corporation engaged in transporting cargo or passengers
for pay. Reference AFI 24-203, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo.
 676                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V1 18 APRIL 2014


Case Designator— A unique code used with a country identification code to identify a
particular foreign military sale. It is a three-character designation. Reference DLM 4000.25.
Cataloging— The process of uniformly describing, classifying, numbering, and publishing in
the FCS all items of personal property (items of supply) repetitively procured, stored, issued, or
used by federal agencies. Reference DoDM 4140.01, Volume 8.
Catalog Management Data (CMD)— The total range of information compiled and published in
Management Data Lists including requisitioning, stock and financial management and
other management control data; and including various referenced relationships to other
items, documents, or materiel management conditions. Reference DoD 4100.39—M.
Central Procurement— The purchase of materiel, supplies or services by an officially
designated command or agency with funds specifically provided for such procurement for the
benefit and use of the entire component or the military departments as a whole. Reference AFI
