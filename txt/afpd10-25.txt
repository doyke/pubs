This publication establishes the Air Force Emergency Management (AFEM) Program use of an
all-hazards approach to integrate plans and organize, train, and equip forces to prepare for,
respond to, recover from, and mitigate the full spectrum of incidents. The AFEM Program
focuses on maintaining and restoring mission capability as a way of assuring mission
continuation and resiliency.

This policy directive establishes the AFEM Program that will use the Air Force Incident
Management System (AFIMS) to respond to incidents. The AFEM Program complements the
National Preparedness Goal and Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 8, National Preparedness.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This documents has been substantially revised and must be completey reviewed. Major changes
include updates to terminology consistent with doctrine and clarification of organizational roles
and responsibilities to manage the AFEM Program.
1. Overview
     1.1. Mission assurance and resiliency through protection of Air Force personnel and
     resources is essential to ensure successful operations on Air Force installations. This AFPD
     addresses activities promoting an all-hazards approach for protection against, response to,
     recovery from, and mitigating of threats, hazards, and incidents at Air Force installations
     worldwide.
     1.2. The primary mission of the AFEM Program is to maintain and restore operational
     capability, save lives, and minimize the loss or degradation of resources in an all-hazards
     environment at AF installations worldwide. The ancillary missions of the AFEM program
     are to support homeland defense and civil support operations and to provide support to civil
     and host nation authorities.
     1.3. Air Force organizations use AFIMS for incident preparedness, response, recovery, and
     mitigation. The Air Force supports federal emergency preparedness and incident
     management programs consistent with military operations. AFEM policies, guidance and
     procedures focus on operational requirements and incorporate them according to the National
     Response Framework, federal statutes, DoD guidance and host-nation agreements. Air Force
     organizations coordinate preparedness, response, and recovery requirements and capabilities
     with Federal, State, local, and tribal governments; other US and foreign military
     organizations, Combatant Commanders (COCOM), Chief of Mission (COM), host-nation
     partners; and international and non-governmental organizations utilizing an all-hazards
     approach in conjunction with a risk management process.
2. Policy. The Air Force establishes, maintains, sustains and improves preparedness through the
following:
     2.1. Integrated and measurable operational standards for determining the requirements for
     equipment, training, manpower, ancillary resources, and installation performace criteria to
     conduct and sustain emergency management (EM) operations.
     2.2. Exercises and evaluations including threat-based assessment of unit capabilities for
     meeting home-station and expeditionary operational standards; conducting integrated
     response operations under expected threat or hazard conditions; and recovery, restoration and
     sustainment of mission capability.

Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS)—A methodology designed to incorporate
requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5), the National Incident
 8                                                                   AFPD10-25 28 APRIL 2014


Management System (NIMS), National Response Framework (NRF), and Office Secretary of
Defense guidance while preserving the requirements of the expeditionary Air Force. AFIMS
provides the Air Force with an incident management system consistent with the NIMS single
comprehensive approach to incident management. It includes a core set of concepts, principles,
terminology, and technologies covering the incident command system, emergency operations
centers, training, qualification and certification, and the management of resources.
All-Hazards Approach—A methodology to develop emergency management strategies for all
different types of potential incidents. “All-hazards” include any incident, natural or manmade
that warrants action to protect the life, property, health, and safety of military members,
dependents, and civilians at risk, and minimize any disruptions of installation operations.
Air Force Emergency Management (AFEM) Program—The single, integrated Air Force
program to coordinate and organize efforts to prepare for, respond to, recover from, and
mitigate incidents and emergencies using an all—hazards approach.
Homeland Defense—The protection of United States sovereignty, territory, domestic
population, and critical defense infrastructure against external threats and aggression or other
threats as directed by the President. Also called HD. (JP 3-27).
National Incident Management System (NIMS)—A set of principles that provides a
systematic, proactive approach guiding government agencies at all levels, nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), and the private sector to work seamlessly to prevent [as it pertains to
hostile/intentional acts,] protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the effects of
incidents, regardless of cause, size, location, or complexity, in order to reduce the loss of life or
property and harm to the environment. (NIMS)
Preparedness—The range of deliberate, critical tasks and activities necessary to build, sustain,
and improve the operational capability to prevent [as it pertains to hostile/intentional acts],
protect against, respond to, and recover from domestic incidents. Preparedness is a continuous
process. Preparedness involves efforts at all levels of government and coordination among
government, private-sector, and NGOs to identify threats, determine vulnerabilities, and identify
required resources. Within NIMS, preparedness is operationally focused on establishing
guidelines, protocols, and standards for planning, training and exercises, personnel qualification
and certification, equipment certification, and publication management. (DoDI 6055.17)
Risk Management—A continual process or cycle where risks are identified, measured, and
evaluated; countermeasures are designed, implemented, and monitored to see how they perform,
with a continual feedback loop for decision-maker input to improve countermeasures and
consider trade-offs between risk acceptance and risk avoidance. (DoDI 6055.17)
