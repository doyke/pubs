                                            Chapter 1

                        BATTLE CONTROL CENTER OVERVIEW

1.1. Overview. This instruction describes the Battle Control Center (BCC), the tactical level
command and control (C2) node which conducts defensive counterair operations in the North
American     Aerospace      Defense    Command/United       States    Northern      Command
(NORAD/USNORTHCOM) and Pacific Command (PACOM) areas of operation/responsibility.
Headquarters Air Combat Command (HQ ACC) organizes, trains, and equips the units within the
Continental United States (CONUS). HQ PACAF organizes, trains, and equips units that operate
the BCC within Alaska, Hawaii and Guam, and units that operate fixed sites within the Republic
of Korea and Japan.
1.2. Threat Environment. America and our deployed forces confront a greater diversity of
threats and challenges than ever before. While the traditional, strategic threat to our deployed
forces and Homeland remains, the terrorist/asymmetric threat has become preeminent. In
addition to long-range military strategic aviation, commercial aircraft, (airliners, charter, cargo,
and business jets), general aviation aircraft, unconventional aircraft (crop dusters, unmanned
aerial vehicles, ultra lights), and cruise missiles (air and sea launched) have been included in the
overall threat profile.
1.3. Purpose. This instruction standardizes the structure, functions, and responsibilities for each
of the ACC and PACAF units listed below.
   1.3.1. CONUS. Within the CONUS, the Eastern and Western Air Defense Sectors employ
   the BCC for their mission.         The Air Defense Sectors are responsible to the
   NORAD/USNORTHCOM Commander through the CONUS NORAD Region (CONR)/Air
   Forces NORTHERN (AFNORTH) Commander for air sovereignty and aerospace control
   during peacetime and air superiority during wartime. Where Air Force Specialty Codes
   (AFSC) are annotated the Canadian Forces equivalent is implied.
   1.3.2. Alaskan Battle Control Center (ABCC).          The ABCC is responsible to the
   NORAD/NORTHCOM Commander through the Alaska NORAD Region (ANR)
   Commander for homeland defense, air defense, air sovereignty, and aerospace warning and
   control of their assigned area of operation. Where AFSCs are annotated the Canadian Forces
   equivalent is implied.
   1.3.3. Hawaii Region Air Operations Center (HIRAOC). The HIRAOC is responsible to the
   PACOM Commander through the Area Air Defense Commander (AADC) for homeland
   defense, air defense, air sovereignty, and aerospace control and warning of their assigned
   area of operation.
   1.3.4. Korean Theater Air Control System (KTACS). U.S. and KTACS elements are
   responsible to the Commander Air Component Command (CACC) for planning, directing,
   and coordinating the execution of military air operations throughout the Republic of Korea
   (ROK).
   1.3.5. Japan Air Defense System (JADS). U.S. and Japan tactical command and control
   elements are responsible to the 5AF and 613 AOC for providing limited battle management,
   weapons control, and exercise support.

1.4. Supplements/Waiver Authority
     1.4.1. Supplements
        1.4.1.1. MAJCOMs will coordinate their supplement to this instruction with ACC/A3C
        before publication and forward one copy to AF/A3O-CS after publication.
        MAJCOM/A3s will approve MAJCOM supplements. Supplements will not contain
        procedures that are contrary to this instruction (T-2). Copies of MAJCOM-level
        supplements, after approved and published, will be provided by the issuing MAJCOM to
        AF/A3O-CS, ACC/A3C, the user MAJCOM, and NGB/A3Y OPRs.
        1.4.1.2. Units will coordinate their supplement with the next higher Group, as applicable,
        prior to MAJCOM approval (T-3). MAJCOM OPRs will approve unit supplements.
        ANG units will coordinate their supplement with NGB/A3Y who in-turn will forward to
        MAJCOM OPRs for approval coordination (T-2).
           1.4.1.2.1. Supplementary guidance will not be less restrictive than the basic
           publication, but can be more restrictive (T-2).
           1.4.1.2.2. Supplemental guidance will not contradict the basic publication (T-2).
     1.4.2. Waivers
        1.4.2.1. Waiver authority for requirements of this volume will be IAW AFI-33-360,
        Publications and Forms Management. Waiver requests must come from commanders (or
        civilian directors) of the affected unit seeking relief from compliance through the
        command chain up to the appropriate tier approval authority (i.e., Tier 0, 1, 2, 3) (or
        publications approval authority if non-tiered). See AFI 33-360 for definition of Tier
        Ratings. Tier 3 waiver authorities for this AFI are as follows: (1) AFNORTH/A3 for
        Eastern Air Defense Sector and Western Air Defense Sector; (2) 611 AOC/CC for 176
        ADS; (3) 109 AOG/CC for 169 ADS; (4) 607 AOC/CC for 621 ACS; (5) 35 FW/CC for
        610 ACF; and (6) 18 WG/CC for 623 ACF.
        1.4.2.2. Waiver requests may be sent via email or memorandum, and must include the
        following (T-2):
           1.4.2.2.1. Reference and text of the specific requirement for which the
           commander/director is requesting a waiver.
           1.4.2.2.2. Rationale for the waiver: Explain which of the following three reasons
           IAW AFI 33-360, apply and describe why:
               1.4.2.2.2.1. The cost of compliance creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority
               task;
               1.4.2.2.2.2. The expected cost of compliance outweighs the benefit;
               1.4.2.2.2.3. Personnel cannot comply with the requirement due to a lack of
               resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower).
           1.4.2.2.3. Time period or circumstance for which the waiver is required.
           1.4.2.2.4. Risk mitigation measures the requesting commander implements during
           the waiver period.
AFI13-1BCCV3 14 NOVEMBER 2014                                                             7


         1.4.2.2.5. Impact if waiver is disapproved.
         1.4.2.2.6. Approved waivers will be uploaded into the unit's Management Internal
         Control Toolset (MICT) for inspection activity review and publication OPR's
         situational awareness/filing (T-2).
  1.4.3. PACAF/A8X and NGB/A3Y will forward a copy of all approved waivers for their
  units to ACC/A3C. ACC/A3C will, in turn, forward a copy of all approved waivers for their
  units to PACAF/A8X, NGB/A3Y, and AF/A3O-CS. Units will forward all approved waivers
  and report all deviations or exceptions without waiver, through their chain of command, to

                        CONUS BATTLE CONTROL CENTER (BCC)

2.1. Mission. The CONUS NORAD Region (CONR) has been subdivided into two geographic
air defense sectors (ADS), Eastern and Western (EADS and WADS respectively). Tactical
execution of defensive counterair, support to counterdrug operations and homeland security is
the responsibility of the units that operate the respective BCCs. The BCCs fuse sensor data and
additional information into a common tactical air picture and distribute the air picture to the
CONR AOC and the NORAD/USNORTHCOM Command Center (N2C2). EADS and WADS
maintain the capability to assume the mission essential operational functions of the other sector,
commonly called expansion operations. NOTE: The National Military Command Center
(NMCC) and interagency partners responsible for Homeland Security at the National Capital
Region Coordination Center (NCRCC) though outside the chain of command of the BCCs, also
receives the tactical air picture.
2.2. Battle Staff (BS). The BS is complementary to the BCC Mission Crew (MC). It provides
both operational and unit level administrative support to the MC. Members of the BS are not
separate personnel authorizations. The BS is composed of members from the operations,
mission support and commander‘s staff. The unit commander (CC) may form the BS as
necessary due to changes in the threat or directed missions from higher headquarters (HHQ).
The BS may be activated for an indefinite period of time. The CC may also tailor and selectively
man positions within the BS for specific operations. When the BS is fully formed, the
commander assumes overall responsibility for the unit’s activities to include:
     2.2.1. Executing homeland defense, air defense, and air sovereignty missions.
     2.2.2. Prioritizing the employment of assets under BCC tactical control.
     2.2.3. Translating the AOC’s Operational level plans [Joint Air Operations Plan (JAOP), air
     operations directive (AOD), air defense plan (ADP), airspace control plan (ACP), airspace
     control order (ACO), air tasking order (ATO), ATO special instructions (SPINS), tactical
     operations data (TACOPDAT), and Operational Tasking Data Link (OPTASK LINK)] into
     tactical level orders for Mission Crew execution.
     2.2.4. Disseminating tactical warning and attack assessment information to the AOC.
     2.2.5. Performing real time battle management support and oversight of the Mission Crew.
NOTE: When the BS is tailored, the commander determines which responsibilities are assumed
by the BS, and which remain with the MC.
2.3. Battle Staff Composition. The BS may be tailored by the commander to execute the
assigned mission. Based on the mission tasking, the BS may consist of any combination of
Commander/ (CC), Director of Operations (DO), Intelligence Officer (IN), Chief, Operations
Control, Emergency Action Coordinator (EAC), Battle Staff Coordinator (BSC), Weapons and
Tactics Officer, Airspace Management Officer, Joint Asset Control Officer, Communications
and Electronics Officer, Antiterrorism Officer, Fighter Officer (FO), Red Switch Coordinator
(RSC) (T-2).

                     ALASKA BATTLE CONTROL CENTER (ABCC)

4.1. Mission. The Alaska Battle Control Center (ABCC) provides air sovereignty and air
defense of the Alaska operational area by executing defensive counter air, interdiction and
counterdrug operations in support of NORAD/NORTHCOM and/or PACOM. The ABCC is
subordinate to the 611 AOC and supports continuation of operations when directed or required
for time critical execution. The ABCC fuses all-source sensor and intelligence data into a
common operational air picture and disseminates integrated tactical warning information and
attack assessment. The 176th Air Defense Squadron (ADS) provides manning for tactical C2
operations. 611 AOC provides manning for the Alaska NORAD Region (ANR) Battle Staff.
4.2. Organization. The ABCC is a weapons system as described in the ACC Enabling Concept
for US Theater Air Control System Battle Control Center, dated 1 Jan 2005. The ABCC is
comprised of those elements described in the enabling concept below. Since the ABCC and 611
AOC are collocated, the ANR/DO functions are conducted by the AOC Commander (ref AFI13-
1AOCV3). The ABCC includes operations and support functions.
   4.2.1. Operations Sections:      Command and Control (C2), Weapons, Identification,
   Surveillance, and Interface Control Sections.
   4.2.2. Support Sections: Training, Standardization and Evaluation, Weapons and Tactics,
   and Operations Support (maintenance, personnel and facility issues).
4.3. Command and Control. The Mission Crew Commander (MCC) and the Chief of Combat
Operations (CCO) form the leadership for the tactical and operational levels, respectively.
   4.3.1. When the ANR BS is formed, CCO directs Region air defense and air sovereignty
   activities. Additionally, CCO directs and coordinates activities of subordinate radar units,
   relays instructions from senior NORAD/NORTHCOM/PACOM elements to subordinate and
   lateral units, and coordinates allocation and employment of air defense resources. CCO is
   assigned or allocated air defense resources, e.g., interceptor, early warning aircraft, etc., that
   are necessary to defend ANR. These resources are used by CCO via the MCC for the
   conduct of assigned responsibilities.
   4.3.2. When Combat Operations are not stood up, the MCC conducts operations under the
   direction of the ANR/CCO or designated representative.
4.4. Battle Control Center (BCC) Mission Crew. The 176 ADS mans the tactical mission
crew portion of the BCC and is the focal point for air defense operations within the ANR and is
responsible for detection and surveillance and identification of any air breathing threat to the
operational area. Supervised by a Mission Crew Commander (MCC), the Mission Crew is
tasked to support the mission on a continuous basis and is manned by the duty positions listed in
Figure 4.1 and can be tailored to mission requirements:
4.5. Crew Manning. Manning of the BCC is based on the personnel assigned through the
approved Unit Manning Document (UMD). Manning requirements are determined by the 176
ADS Director of Operations. It will cover day-to-day operations and periods of increased
readiness and exercises (T-3). Figure 4.1 depicts the Combat Mission Crew Composition for the
Alaska NORAD Region BCC.

       tell to ensure mission requirements are met (T-3). If an AWACS is on station with ADIZ
       coverage, its surveillance TPA will be expanded within the ADIZ without an orbit change
AFI13-1BCCV3 14 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                 53


       (T-3). The ABCC AST, through the MCC, will recommend to the Chief of Combat
       Operations (CCO) an AWACS orbit change and/or other means to reconfigure the Sector
       to support the active air defense mission as necessary (T-3).
       4.13.1.2. An AWACS orbit may be adjusted to cover the loss of a single site‘s radar.
       The orbit change would offset the loss of ADIZ coverage without degrading overall
       coverage.
   4.13.2. Weapons. Interceptor control would be provided solely by AWACS or the site in the
   area affected. The deployed WD program does not exist anymore. The extent of the radar
   coverage loss would dictate whether or not the CCO would transition the AWACS from
   Level I to Level II. If the ABCC has degraded coverage in an area, AWACS should
   anticipate transition to Level II or Level III, depending on the air situation at the time.
   Command would be retained at the CCO. Airborne fighters would be informed of the
   situation by the ABCC WD and directed to contact the AWACS, or augmenting Ground
   Theater Air Control System (GTACS) unit as appropriate.
4.14. Radar Configuration. The unit will develop Letters of Agreement (LOAs) /
Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) between the sector and FAA for FAA/USAF joint-use
long range and short range radars (LRR/SRRs) in the Joint Surveillance System (JSS) (T-0). At
a minimum, these agreements will address procedures for the management of data controls and
equipment malfunction reporting (T-0). The following guidelines will be used for determining
the point of contact for reporting equipment malfunctions that affect operating parameters (T-3):
   4.14.1. Equipment Malfunctions. All malfunctions will be reported and coordinated through
   the ABCC Air Force Job Control (AFJC) (T-3).
   4.14.2. JSS Operating Parameters--Joint Use Radar Sites. For joint use radar sites, the AFJC
   is responsible for coordinating with the FAA National Airspace System Operation Manager
   (NOM) at the appropriate Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) for any changes to the
   basis operating parameters (T-0).
4.15. Radar Configuration Changes. The following procedures for configuration changes will
apply, unless specifically directed otherwise by the ABCC (T-3):
   4.15.1. USAF LRRs. When the FAA requires setting changes to the beacon, search radar or
   the common digitizer that affect both users, coordination will be accomplished with the
   respective sector AFJC (T-3). AFJC will coordinate with the ASO/T regarding requested
   changes (T-3).
   4.15.2. USAF/FAA Joint Use LRRs. All radar changes at FAA/USAF joint use LRRs must
   be coordinated with FAA IAW established LOAs/MOUs prior to the declaration of Air
   Defense Emergency (ADE) (T-0). At ADE, actions taken to obtain data are considered
   dynamic in nature and are exempt from prior coordination. When immediate or emergency
   action is required, the ASO/T will be notified of the changes as soon as possible (T-3).
   Procedures will be developed for configuration changes requiring immediate or emergency
   actions (T-3). After the procedures have been coordinated and approved by the unit DO,
   checklists will be published and used to ensure expediency of configuration changes (T-3).
   When the sector ASO/T requires setting changes for live flying exercises, in-flight
   emergency, execution of CONPLAN 3310 or missions against an unknown target,

 coordination will be accomplished through AFJC to return the feature/device change to their
 normal day-to-day setting at the termination of the event (T-3).
AFI13-1BCCV3 14 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                 55

                     KOREAN THEATER AIR CONTROL SYSTEM

5.1. Mission. The mission of the Korean Theater Air Control System (KTACS) is to plan,
direct, and coordinate the employment of forces engaged in air operations throughout the
Republic of Korea (ROK), as directed by the Commander Air Component Command (CACC).
5.2. Organization. KTACS provides the organization and equipment necessary to plan, direct,
and control air operations as well as to coordinate and link combined, unified, and joint
operations. The KTACS is based on the principles of centralized control, decentralized
execution, and coordinated efforts.
   5.2.1. Korean Air Operation Center. The Korean Air Operation Center (KAOC) is the focal
   point of the KTACS, located in the Hardened Theater Air Control Center (HTACC), which
   exercises centralized control and coordination of air operations. The KAOC monitors the
   execution of OPLANs in the planning and conduct of day-to-day air operations. Its primary
   responsibility is to provide the means for directing the detailed employment of available air
   efforts, through two independently staffed divisions; the 607th Combat Plans Division (CPD)
   and the 607th Combat Operations Division (COD).
       5.2.1.1. The CPD produces and disseminates the Air Tasking Orders (ATO). Assisted by
       the deputy for operations and deputy for intelligence, the CACC sets the allocation of air
       efforts.
       5.2.1.2. The COD supervises the detailed execution of the air operations orders, ATO,
       and is responsible for conducting and integrating all air operations through use of the
       KTACS.
   5.2.2. MCRC. Directly subordinate to the KAOC is the Master Control and Reporting
   Center (MCRC). The MCRC is responsible for surveillance, identification, and weapons
   control. The 1st MCRC consists of two units (ROKAF callsign “WATCHMAN” and USAF
   621 ACS callsign “COBRA”) that perform the primary Air Defense mission in the ROK
   within two operations centers inside the HTACC facility. WATCHMAN conducts
   operations through a pc-based system while COBRA operates the pc-based Battle Control
   System-Korea (BCS-K) via the Tactical Display Framework (TDF). The 2nd MCRC
   (Callsign “ACACIA”) located in Daegu also shares in Air Defense operations. During
   armistice operations, WATCHMAN assumes primary surveillance and identification for 1st
   MCRC as well as responsibility for control of ROKAF assets. COBRA personnel provide
   primary battle management and weapons control for US assets. The ROKAF Tactical
   Control Director (TCD) has overall responsibility for the ROKAF MCRC personnel during
   armistice. Working in conjunction with the TCD is the senior USAF representative, the
   Mission Crew Commander (MCC). The MCC performs all coordination with the TCD
   through the assistance of two ROKAF Coordinators attached to Cobra who serve as
   interpreters and are the crew‘s link to the ROKAF TCD and Senior Director (SD). COBRA
   is the primary USAF air battle management and weapons control element in the ROK.
   COBRA is comprised of MCC, SD, MCCT, DST, AWO/WD, and 3CO mission teams.
   COBRA also coordinates, directs, and deconflicts employment of US (and ROKAF, when
   directed) tactical aircraft in their assigned missions.
