SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include updates office symbols in accordance with the wing redesignation.
1. Policy:
    1.1. 87 ABW personnel, both military and civilian, must not engage in off-duty employment
    that:
       1.1.1. Is prohibited by statute or regulation;
       1.1.2. Would detract from readiness;
       1.1.3. Would pose a security risk; or
       1.1.4. Would bring discredit upon the armed forces.
    1.2. Explanation of Terms.
       1.2.1. The term "off-duty employment" means business activities and compensated
       outside employment, including self-employment. Examples of self-employment include
       the sale of insurance, stocks, mutual funds, real estate, cosmetics, household supplies,
       vitamins, and other goods or services.
       1.2.2. The term "readiness" includes the ability of the Air Force to perform its mission in
       the manner and at the time and place required, and the ability of a military member or
       civilian employee to perform his or her government duties in the manner and at the time
       and place required.
    1.3. All civilian and military personnel who intend to perform off-duty employment,
    including employment while on terminal leave, shall submit an AF Form 3902 to their first-
    level supervisor at least two weeks before beginning employment (except in cases where two
    weeks notice is not possible). Final approval must be obtained prior to starting off-duty
    employment. Medical service personnel must comply with the requirements regarding off-
    duty employment in AFI 44-102, Community Health Management, in addition to the
    requirements of this instruction.
    1.4. A new AF Form 3902 must be submitted whenever the type of employment or the
    employer changes, the individual's Air Force duties change significantly, or the number of
    regularly-scheduled off-duty hours increases. Occasional increases in hours due to situations
    such as the availability of overtime work, or the need to fill in for an absent co-worker, do
    not require resubmission of the AF Form 3902. Previously denied requests may be
    resubmitted after a change in the individual's Air Force duties.
    1.5. Military personnel who fail to comply with the filing requirements of this instruction
    violate a lawful general order which may result in appropriate disciplinary action or criminal
    liability under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Air Force civilian
    employees who violate this instruction by failing to comply with its filing requirements are
    subject to appropriate disciplinary action without regard to criminal liability.
2. Procedures for Completing AF Form 3902:
    2.1. The employee completes Section I.
MCGUIREAFBI51-201 16 DECEMBER 2009                                                              3


   2.2. The employee's immediate supervisor completes Section II.
   2.3. In cases where the employee is required to file a SF 278, Public Financial Disclosure
   Report, or an OGE Form 450, Confidential Financial Disclosure Report, and where the off-
   duty employment will be with a "prohibited source" as defined in the JER, DoD 5500.7-R,
   (which includes any person or company that does business or seeks to do business with the
   DoD, regardless of the dollar amount of the contract or purchase), a 87 ABW Judge
   Advocate shall complete Section III. In other cases, JA review is not required unless
   requested by the employee's immediate supervisor.
   2.4. Section IV is completed by the first person in the employee’s chain of command or
   supervision who is a commissioned military officer or a civilian GS-12 or above, and who is
   above the employee’s immediate supervisor. However, if the employee’s immediate
   supervisor is a General Officer, SES member, or Wing Commander, then the immediate
   supervisor also completes Section IV. The individuals specified in this paragraph who are
   authorized to complete Section IV of the AF Form 3902 (other than Unit Commanders) are
   considered to be Delegates of Unit Commanders, for purposes of completing Section IV of
   the AF Form 3902.
3. Filing AF Form 3902:
   3.1. After a request is approved or disapproved, the original request will be maintained either
   by the individual's unit, or in one or more centralized locations (such as a Squadron Section
   Commander's office). In cases where the Legal Office coordinated on the AF Form 3902, a
   copy of the completed AF Form 3902 will be sent to the Legal Office, which will maintain
   the form as required by the Joint Ethics Regulation, DoD 5500.7-R.
