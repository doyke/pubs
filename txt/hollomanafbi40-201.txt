                                         CHAPTER 1

                                          GENERAL

1. General. Radioactive materials and ionizing radiation producing devices (RPD) have many
beneficial uses in industrial applications, construction, armament development and testing, and
research. Such materials and equipment may be directly or indirectly hazardous to personnel by
virtue of their potential to cause serious biological damage to body tissues and organs and are of
significant concern with respect to protection of the environment. Federal regulations set
specific limits for exposure to ionizing radiation (or dose equivalent), which include keeping all
exposures “As Low As Reasonably Achievable” (ALARA). When the term “base” is used in
this instruction, it includes all areas under Holloman control or jurisdiction unless otherwise
noted.

Abnormal Exposure—An exposure received in any monitoring period that, if continued at the
same rate, would exceed the limits specified in 10 CFR. Determine an abnormal exposure dose
equivalent by dividing the applicable (stochastic or nonstochastic) annual limit by the number of
monitoring periods during the year. For stochastic exposures, an abnormal exposure is 417
millirem (mrem) [4.2 milliSievert (mSv)] for any monthly monitoring period and 1250 mrem
(12.5 mSv) for any quarterly monitoring period.
ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) Program—A set of management and
administrative actions taken to reduce personnel radiation exposures to as low as reasonably
achievable. The ALARA concept was developed in response to scientific evidence that suggests
that no level of ionizing radiation exposure is totally risk free.
ALARA Action Level—Locally established radiation exposure limits for personnel dosimetry
results that are less than the Air Force established criteria used to flag exposures that are above
normal, higher than expected, or could potentially result in an abnormal exposure if trends
continue. Informal investigation is conducted by permit RSO to determine the specifics of the
exposure, such as change in workload, tasks, or position. Results are reported to the Radiation
Safety Committee.
Area TLD Monitor—Person assigned by the unit or section responsible for enforcing Operating
Instructions/Standards of the TLD program for that unit or area.
TLD—Thermoluminescent Dosimeter--The personnel dosimeter is used to indicate a close
approximation of the exposure dose to ionizing radiation to ensure exposures are maintained
ALARA. The badge contains a thermoluminescent dosimetry packet. The packet is exchanged
monthly or quarterly depending on the area where an individual works.
Pregnant Worker Action Level—Personnel dosimetry result which, if continued for the term of
pregnancy, would exceed the 500 mrem/9 month exposure limit for the fetus. This equates to
approximately 55 mrem on a monthly TLD.

A formal investigation IAW chapter 9 of AFMAN 48-125 Personnel Ionizing Radiation
Dosimetry will be conducted by the base RSO or designated representative when levels exceed
the above values.
2. Exposures exceeding 5 mrem/quarter will initiate an informal investigation to verify proper
ALARA principles are being followed. Informal investigations will be briefed at the Aerospace
Medicine Council (AMC).
