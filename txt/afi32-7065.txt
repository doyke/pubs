SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This is a revised publication of AFI 32-7065, dated 13 June 1994. Major revisions include a complete
reorganization, expanded descriptions of Air Force organizational responsibilities, updated and expanded
sections on compliance requirements, and more complete information and guidance on managing Air
Force cultural resources. Much of the 1994 Instruction is incorporated and updated in five chapters, rather
than the eight chapters of the 1994 Instruction. The five chapters in this document are organized around
three principal actions associated with cultural resources compliance: Inventory, Project Review, and
General Management. In addition, this revision contains only two attachments, instead of the five attach-
ments to the 1994 Instruction. The first attachment is titled Glossary of References and Supporting Infor-
2                                                                                                            AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004


mation, which includes a comprehensive set of references, terms, acronyms, and authorizing legislation,
regulations, and orders. The second attachment, titled Guidelines for Preparing Integrated Cultural
Resources Management Plans is a greatly expanded and updated version of guidelines in the 1994 Instruc-
tion.

                                                 Chapter 1

                                 HOW TO USE THIS INSTRUCTION

1.1. Background:
    1.1.1. Cultural Resources. Cultural resources include “historic properties” as defined in the
    National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), Title 16. United States Code, section 470, et seq., (16
    U.S.C. §470, et seq.; “cultural items” as defined in the Native American Graves Protection and Repa-
    triation Act (NAGPRA), 25 U.S.C. §§3001-3013; “archaeological resources” as defined in the Archae-
    ological Resources Protection Act (ARPA), 16 U.S.C. §§470aa-470mm; and “sacred sites” as defined
    in Executive Order (E.O.) 13007, Indian Sacred Sites, May 24, 1996. Cultural resources are often gen-
    erally referred to as "heritage resources." "Historic properties" are cultural resources that are eligible
    for listing to the National Register of Historic Places (National Register).
    1.1.2. Cultural Resources Program. Cultural Resources program management incorporates a suite
    of specific methods, techniques, policies, plans, and practices that an agency uses to meet its respon-
    sibilities regarding Cultural Resources Management and historic preservation. The Air Force program
    is executed at Major Commands (MAJCOMs) and installations.
    1.1.3. Cultural Resources Manager. The person appointed by a commander on a primary or collat-
    eral duty basis to manage the installation’s or MAJCOM’s cultural resources program.
    1.1.4. Legal Requirements. Federal statutes, regulations, guidance documents and Executive Orders
    cited in Attachment 1 provide the legal basis of the Air Force's compliance responsibilities for man-
    aging cultural resources. Air Force installations and organizations must comply with state and local
    cultural resources laws when sovereign immunity has been waived in relevant federal statutes. Even if
    sovereign immunity has not been waived, Air Force installations are encouraged to comply with rele-
    vant state and local cultural resources standards and requirements where they do not conflict with fed-
    eral requirements and the Air Force mission, and compliance with such non-mandatory state and local
    requirements does not violate fiscal law restrictions. Consult with the Staff Judge Advocate’s office to
    determine whether or to what extent sovereign immunity may have been waived and to determine
    whether any fiscal law principles may prevent or limit compliance with state or local requirements
    when sovereign immunity has not been waived.
    1.1.5. Requirements for managing cultural resources at Air Force installations are defined in this reg-
    ulation. Further detailed requirements can be found in the laws or regulations cited in this Instruction
    and listed in Attachment 1.
    1.1.6. Environmental Management System. Consistent with Executive Order (E.O.) 13148, Green-
    ing Government Through Leadership in Environmental Management, April 21, 2000, Air Force
    installations will develop and implement an environmental management system to sustain, restore,
    and modernize natural infrastructure to support mission capability. The system will be compatible
    with and support the Air Force Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health Management System
    (ESOHMS). All Air Force installations and facilities will comply with the goals of E.O. 13148 and
    Air Force EMS interim guidance.

1.2. Goals:
AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004                                                                                    5


   1.2.1. The Air Force will identify, manage, and maintain its important cultural resources in a spirit of
   stewardship for the benefit of this and future generations of Americans.
   1.2.2. The Air Force will endeavor to integrate cultural resources stewardship with the needs of its
   primary military mission.

1.3. Policies:
   1.3.1. Air Force personnel must comply with the Federal statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, and
   Presidential Memoranda listed in Attachment 1, and must ensure that mission requirements are car-
   ried out in accordance with these requirements.
   1.3.2. Air Force personnel must comply with relevant state and local cultural resources laws and reg-
   ulations as set forth in ¶1.1.4., Legal Requirements.
   1.3.3. The keys to the successful integration of Air Force mission requirements and cultural resources
   compliance and management responsibilities are early planning and coordination.
   1.3.4. The installation commander will develop and use the Integrated Cultural Resources Manage-
   ment Plan (ICRMP) to comply with mandated cultural resources management requirements. (See
   ¶4.10. and the ICRMP definition in Attachment 1.)
   1.3.5. Inventory, Project Review, and General Management are the three principal actions associated
   with cultural resources compliance. Minimal compliance requirements for each action are summa-
   rized in this Instruction.
   1.3.6. Timeliness. The consultation process, where applicable, for all proposed projects affecting cul-
   tural resources on an installation will be conducted so as not to negatively impact the military mission,
   project schedule or costs. Such consultations will be initiated at the earliest practicable stage in the
   Environmental Impact Analysis Process, and unless extraordinary circumstances prevent it, will be
   completed prior to finalizing any NEPA documents (Categorical Exclusion (CATEX) determination,
   Environmental Assessment/Finding of No Significant Impact or Environmental Impact Statement).

                                              INVENTORY

2.1. Identification:
   2.1.1. Inventory [per NHPA, Section 110(a)(2)(A), 16 U.S.C. §470h-2(a)(2)(A)] cultural resources
   under control of the installation through identification and evaluation methods defined in:
       2.1.1.1. Title 36, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 800 (36 CFR § 800), Protection of His-
       toric Properties, §800.4.
       2.1.1.2. 48 Federal Register 44716-44742 (29 Sept 1983), Archeology and Historic Preservation:
       Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines.
   2.1.2. Archaeological Sampling.
       2.1.2.1. Installations will survey their accessible land area for cultural resources. For larger instal-
       lations and ranges (i.e., greater than 200,000 acres) appropriate sampling surveys will be con-
       ducted to predict the numbers, types, natures, and locations of archaeological resources on lands
       not surveyed.
       2.1.2.2. Work with SHPO and MAJCOM to develop sampling survey methods.
       2.1.2.3. Plan and program annual identification efforts on large installations and ranges to com-
       plete a MAJCOM-approved level of sampling survey each year.
   2.1.3. Level of Effort. Program in conjunction with installation long range plans to ensure that identi-
   fication focuses first on areas where future construction and development is most imminent.
   2.1.4. Identify, or predict through sampling, the location of archaeological sites, artifacts, districts,
   and landscapes on Air Force controlled property.
   2.1.5. Identify all historic buildings, structures, districts, and landscapes on Air Force controlled
   lands.
       2.1.5.1. Historic buildings and structures typically are older than 50 years of age.
       2.1.5.2. Cold War resources were built or used by the Air Force between 1946 and 1989.
       2.1.5.3. Historic landscapes include but are not limited to significant topography, vegetation
       (plants, trees, shrubs, and lawns), water features (ponds and streams), circulation features such as
       roads, paths, steps, walls, buildings and furnishings, including fences, benches, lights and sculp-
       tural objects (see Preservation Brief 36, Protecting Cultural Landscapes, US Department of the
       Interior, National Park Service, June 29, 2001).
   2.1.6. Identify American Indian sacred sites, cultural items (per NAGPRA), and traditional resources
   of appropriate affiliated cultures (per National Register Bulletin 38, Guidelines for Evaluating and
   Documenting Traditional Cultural Properties, US Department of the Interior, National Park Service,
   1990).

2.2. Evaluation: Evaluate and determine National Register eligibility of identified cultural resources
(see 36 CFR §60, National Register of Historic Places, §60.4, Criteria for Evaluation).
10                                                                              AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004


     2.2.1. Evaluation can be accomplished in several ways, and installations have flexibility to determine
     the methods they will use. Consult with SHPOs in selecting evaluation methods. Example methods
     include:
        2.2.1.1. The installation, SHPO, and other consulting parties agree to treat properties as eligible
        for the National Register. The determination can be based on existing documentation or no docu-
        mentation.
        2.2.1.2. The installation and SHPO develop sampling programs to determine eligibility of
        selected resources. Extrapolate the results to the larger population of similar resources to estimate
        the approximate number of eligible sites in the entire area.
        2.2.1.3. The installation follows SHPO guidelines for archaeological testing, or consults to use
        alternative methods for testing on installation controlled lands.
        2.2.1.4. The installation develops and consults with SHPO on installation-specific contexts for
        determining eligibility.
     2.2.2. The level and extent of evaluation efforts should be commensurate to the complexity and nature
     of the undertaking. Evaluate only enough to reach a reasonable conclusion.
     2.2.3. Follow state guidelines for research and reporting where appropriate.
     2.2.4. Cold War era resources less than 50 years old must be of exceptional importance to the nation's
     history to be eligible to the National Register (refer to HQ USAF/CE Memorandum, Interim Guid-
     ance for Cold War Resources, 29 June 1993, and National Register Bulletin 22, Guidelines for Evalu-
     ating and Nominating Properties that have Achieved Significance Within the Last Fifty Years, US
     Department of Interior, National Park Service, 1996).

2.3. Completion of NHPA Section 110 Inventory: An installation's inventory of historic properties,
required under NHPA §110(a)(2)(A) [16 U.S.C. §470h-2(a)(2)(A)], and accomplished through identifica-
tion and evaluation, is complete when:
     2.3.1. Qualified personnel have surveyed all undisturbed and accessible lands, or appropriately sam-
     pled or researched the land or properties under the installation's control, and have provided their find-
     ings and recommendations to the installation,
     2.3.2. The installation has provided its inventory methods and determinations of eligibility to the
     SHPO for comment and concurrence, and to other interested parties for comment,
     2.3.3. In case of disagreements, the Keeper of the National Register (Keeper), located in the National
     Park Service (NPS), makes final determinations of eligibility for disputed properties,
     2.3.4. The installation has planned for managing and maintaining identified historic properties in their
     ICRMP, and
     2.3.5. The installation has appropriately curated recovered artifacts and associated records.

2.4. Unevaluated Resources: Identified, but not evaluated, archaeological sites comprise a large number
of cultural resources on installations.
     2.4.1. Manage identified but unevaluated or "potentially eligible" resources as if eligible for the
     National Register.
AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004                                                                                  11


   2.4.2. Program and budget annually for evaluation of a portion of unevaluated resources.
   2.4.3. Require contractors (through SOW tasks and research designs) to conduct sufficient research
   during inventory. This would include assessing sites and providing recommendations on National
   Register eligibility.

2.5. National Register of Historic Places
   2.5.1. Determinations of Eligibility.
       2.5.1.1. Assess and determine the National Register eligibility of properties according to 36 CFR
       §60.4, based on recommendations of professionally qualified investigators (see also National
       Register Bulletin 15, How to Apply the National Register Criteria for Evaluation, US Department
       of Interior, National Park Service, 1991).
       2.5.1.2. MAJCOMs will review installations' determinations of eligibility prior to them being sent
       to the SHPO for comment and concurrence.
   2.5.2. Disagreements Regarding National Register Eligibility.
       2.5.2.1. The installation may request a determination of eligibility from the Keeper in accordance
       with 36 CFR §63, Determinations of Eligibility for Inclusion in the National Register of Historic
       Places, §63.2, when disagreements on eligibility occur between the Air Force and the SHPO.
       2.5.2.2. Requests to the Keeper will be staffed and routed from the installation to MAJCOM to
       HQ USAF/ILEV.
       2.5.2.3. The Keeper's determination is final.
   2.5.3. Nominations for Listing of Historic Properties to the National Register.
       2.5.3.1. The Air Force will give priority to nominating those properties the installation intends to
       interpret, commemorate, or actively manage as sites of historic significance, and which are open
       to the base community and/or the general public.
       2.5.3.2. An installation's intention to nominate a property must be coordinated through the MAJ-
       COM to HQ USAF/ILEV.
       2.5.3.3. Once coordinated, forward all required materials to the SHPO for review and concur-
       rence.
       2.5.3.4. After SHPO review, HQ USAF/ILEV forwards the nomination package to the Air Force
       FPO.

                                               Chapter 3

                                         PROJECT REVIEW

3.1. The NHPA Section 106 Process:
   3.1.1. All proposed Air Force actions that might affect historic properties are subject to review under
   Section 106 of the NHPA.
      3.1.1.1. The installation commander (through delegation to the BHPO) will identify and evaluate
      all cultural resources in the area of potential effect (APE) of an undertaking, and will take into
      account the effects of all undertakings on historic properties.
      3.1.1.2. Detailed review procedures for compliance are provided in the NHPA, Section 106 and 36
      CFR §800.
      3.1.1.3. Failure to take into account the effects of an undertaking on historic properties according
      to Section 106 and 36 CFR Part 800 can result in the Council's formal notification of foreclosure
      to the SAF [per 36 CFR §800.9(b)]. Foreclosure is a term that implies a Federal agency has initi-
      ated an action before providing the Council an opportunity, in consultation with the SHPO and
      other interested parties, to comment on the undertaking.
          3.1.1.3.1. The Council publishes determinations of foreclosure and notifies interested parties
          of the action undertaken on an installation's historic properties. A notice of foreclosure can be
          used to support a court determination that the installation has violated Section 106, should the
          issue be litigated.
      3.1.1.4. Consult with the SHPO (or Tribal Historic Preservation Officer [THPO] for Indian lands),
      and other consulting parties, to identify, evaluate, and mitigate any adverse effects on historic
      properties.
      3.1.1.5. Afford Indian Tribes the opportunity to participate as consulting parties during the con-
      sultation process for undertakings on Air Force lands that might affect properties having historic
      traditional value to those Tribes (per 36 CFR § 800.2).
      3.1.1.6. Afford the public an opportunity to comment on actions that might affect historic proper-
      ties (per 36 CFR §800.6).
      3.1.1.7. Develop and evaluate alternatives or modifications to proposed undertakings that could
      avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse effects on historic properties.
      3.1.1.8. Mitigation: Air Force undertakings adversely affecting historic properties require mitiga-
      tion measures that are outlined in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Programmatic Agree-
      ment (PA) (between the installation and SHPO and other appropriate parties) or cited in the
      relevant Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) document.
          3.1.1.8.1. PAs and MOAs executed pursuant to NHPA Section 106 and 36 CFR §800.11 and
          §800.14 are legally binding compliance agreements.
          3.1.1.8.2. Management procedures and determinations stipulated in PAs and MOAs should be
          described and integrated into the installation’s ICRMP.
14                                                                            AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004


            3.1.1.8.3. Under Section 110(b) of the NHPA, 16 U.S.C. §470h-2(b), MOAs or PAs will
            require Historic American Building Survey/Historic American Engineering Records (HABS/
            HAER) documentation to mitigate adverse effects when demolition of historic buildings or
            structures on an installation is unavoidable, or when the Air Force intends to convey historic
            buildings to a non-federal agency.
               3.1.1.8.3.1. The level and kind of HABS/HAER recordation depends on the property's rel-
               ative significance and the nature of the undertaking’s effects, determined in consultation
               with the SHPO/THPO, Council, or the NPS.
               3.1.1.8.3.2. 48 Federal Register 44731-44734 (Sept 29, 1983) contains HABS/HAER
               documentation standards.
            3.1.1.8.4. Archaeological data recovery: When adverse effects to archaeological historic prop-
            erties cannot be avoided and data recovery is required in an MOA or PA, comply with:
               3.1.1.8.4.1. Archaeological and Historic Preservation: Secretary of the Interior's Stan-
               dards and Guidelines.

               for Curating Department of Defense Archaeological Collections, 1999.
        3.1.1.9. Draft PAs or MOAs, whether prepared by the installation or another party, such as a
        SHPO/THPO, will be staffed and routed for legal and technical review with the installation CRM,
        Judge Advocate (JA), BCE, the installation commander and the MAJCOM.
            3.1.1.9.1. The MAJCOM will elevate the agreement to HQ USAF/ILEV for technical and
            legal review.
            3.1.1.9.2. The installation commander has signature authority for PAs or MOAs pertaining to
            properties under his/her control, unless otherwise directed by SAF/IEE.
            3.1.1.9.3. The Air Force FPO has signature authority for PAs and MOAs that affect the entire
            Air Force or for unique actions that affect policy.
            3.1.1.9.4. The installation provides a copy of the fully executed PA or MOA to the MAJCOM
            and any and all signatory parties.
     3.1.2. Terminating Consultation:
        3.1.2.1. The installation commander may request the Air Force FPO terminate consultation and
        seek final comments of the Council, when the installation, the SHPO/THPO, the Council and/or
        other consulting parties are unable to agree on steps to resolve adverse effects to a historic prop-
        erty [per 36 CFR §800.7(a)].
        3.1.2.2. Do not terminate consultation without first acquiring approval from higher headquarters.
        3.1.2.3. Send notice of termination actions to the SAF through the MAJCOM and HQ USAF/
        ILEV.
AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004                                                                                  15


       3.1.2.4. HQ USAF/ILEV provides the Air Force FPO with an assessment and recommendation of
       the termination action.
       3.1.2.5. The Air Force FPO will prepare the SAF's response to the Council comments.
       3.1.2.6. Additional information regarding the termination of consultation may be required.
   3.1.3. BRAC Installations:
       3.1.3.1. Site Managers or the Director of the Air Force Real Property Agency (AFRPA) function
       as the installation commander for the purposes of NHPA compliance and PA and MOA staffing
       when an installation is included in the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) program.
       3.1.3.2. Comply with AFRPA staffing procedures and signatory authority for BRAC NHPA Sec-
       tion 106 PAs and MOAs.

3.2. Consultation with Native Americans:

   Indian Tribes (see “Indian Tribes”, Attachment 1) pursuant to NHPA Section 110(a)(2) [16 U.S.C.
   §470h-2(a)(2)] and 36 CFR §800.2 to identify, evaluate, and treat historic properties that have reli-
   gious or cultural importance to those groups.
   3.2.2. Air Force policy requires installation commanders, or their designated 0-6 representatives, to
   meet periodically with designated representatives of each Indian Tribe that is affected by the installa-
   tion's plans, activities, or operations (per HQ USAF/CVA Memorandum, Consultation with American
   Indian Tribal Governments and Alaska Native Organizations, 10 Nov 97).

   and need are being defined and a wide range of alternatives is open. Coordinate Section 106 compli-
   ance with the NEPA process per 36 CFR §800.8.
   3.3.2. Substitute the NEPA process for separate NHPA Section 106 review of alternatives, by comply-
   ing with 36 CFR §800.8(c):
       3.3.2.1. Notify the SHPO/THPO and Council that the installation intends to substitute NEPA for
       the NHPA Section 106 process.
       3.3.2.2. Invite interested parties and appropriate Indian Tribes to participate.
16                                                                            AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004

        effect during NEPA scoping, analysis, and documentation review. Involve the public in accordance
        with AFI 32-7061, as promulgated at 32 CFR §989.
        3.3.2.6. Develop alternatives and mitigation measures in consultation with the various parties, and
        describe them in the Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).
        3.3.2.7. Specify in the Finding of No Significant Effect (FONSI) or Record of Decision (ROD)
        the measures proposed to mitigate adverse effects on historic properties, and ensure that approval
        of the undertaking contains the same conditions.
        3.3.2.8. A FONSI requires a MOA for mitigating adverse effects; a ROD does not, per 36 CFR
        §800.8(c)(4).

3.4. NEPA Categorical Exclusions (CATEXes): Installation Commanders will determine if a project,
activity, or program which is categorically excluded under Air Force NEPA procedures, qualifies as an
undertaking requiring NHPA Section 106 review [per 36 CFR §800.8(b)].

3.5. Engineering Work Order Review:
     3.5.1. The installation CRM will participate in the environmental review of work requests (Air Force
     Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request) and requests for environmental impact analysis.
     3.5.2. All Air Force Forms 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis Categorical Exclu-
     sion, initiated at base level will be reviewed and coordinated with the installation CRM. If the work
     order request indicates the need to conduct an environmental analysis, the installation CRM must
     ensure that impacts to significant cultural resources are considered and avoided or mitigated (refer to
     AFI 32-7061, as promulgated at 32 CFR §989) in CATEXes, EAs, and EISs.

3.6. Military Construction Planning and Design:
     3.6.1. Establish and implement alternatives to demolition of historic buildings and structures by con-
     sidering adaptive re-use, mothballing, transfer, sale, or lease.
     3.6.2. Document historic buildings and structures that will be altered or destroyed due to Air Force
     actions.
     3.6.3. Air Force MILCON and Family Housing MILCON projects will include historic properties in
     their background data review, historic renovation cost factors, and Military Construction Project Data
     (form DD 1391, Military Construction Project Data) development (per AFMAN 32-1089, Air
     Force Military Construction and Family Housing Economic Analysis Guide).
     3.6.4. The installation CRM must review MILCON project plans to ensure compliance with NHPA
     Section 106.
AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004                                                                                    17


3.7. Repair and Maintenance Activities: Repair to a facility that exceeds 70 percent of its replacement
cost is classified by the Air Force as construction (per AFI 32-1032, Planning and Programming Appro-
priated Funded Maintenance, Repair, and Construction Projects). This rule does not apply to buildings or
structures listed on or eligible to the National Register of Historic Places. This permits greater leeway for
installations to design mitigation for adverse effects to historic properties. Note: Construction and mainte-
nance costs are not eligible for Conservation funding.

3.8. Real Property Actions:
   3.8.1. Coordinate with the real property manager to ensure that:
       3.8.1.1. Real property records accurately describe cultural resources.
       3.8.1.2. Installation archaeological sites are indicated (not specifically located) on real property
       records and appropriate base maps and plans.
   3.8.2. The installation commander must ensure that the significant value of properties are appropri-
   ately preserved when Air Force historic properties are transferred to private parties or state, tribal, or
   local governments.
   3.8.3. Transfer of historic properties to another Federal agency does not require such protection
   because the receiving agency will assume the normal federal preservation responsibilities.
   3.8.4. The base CRM ensures SHPO coordination prior to the disposal of real property outside the
   federal government (e.g., Declarations of Excess and AF Form 300, Facility Disposal).

3.9. Inadvertent Discoveries of Archaeological Objects or Native American Human Remains and
Cultural Items:
   3.9.1. Installations will ensure that inadvertent discoveries of Native American cultural items comply
   with NAGPRA and 43 CFR §10. When potential NAGPRA cultural items are inadvertently found on
   Air Force lands, follow these procedures;
       3.9.1.1. Immediately cease construction activities in the vicinity of the discovery. If the remains
       or artifacts are determined to be NAGPRA cultural items, the construction activities must be halted
       for 30 days after notifying the commander (see 3.9.1.6.). If the remains or artifacts are not subject
       to NAGPRA, the activity may resume when the items have been recorded and evaluated in accor-
       dance with ARPA and the NHPA (see 3.9.6. and 3.9.7.).
       3.9.1.2. Notification:
           3.9.1.2.1. Finder (e.g., construction crew, utility workers) must immediately notify the CRM.
           3.9.1.2.2. CRM must immediately notify the installation commander and the MAJCOM.
           3.9.1.2.3. CRM takes steps to ascertain that cultural items or remains are truly Native Ameri-
           can and not those of some other group. Only Native American remains and cultural items are
           covered under NAGPRA.
           3.9.1.2.4. Installation commander certifies in writing that he/she was notified of the discovery.
           3.9.1.2.5. MAJCOM will notify HQ USAF/ILEV.
18                                                                            AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004


            3.9.1.2.6. Within 3 working days of determining that cultural items or remains are NAGPRA
            items, the installation commander or CRM must notify officials of Indian Tribes likely to be
            culturally affiliated (per 43 CFR §10.4).
        3.9.1.3. Protect the discovery from disturbance, erosion, or vandalism.
        3.9.1.4. Consult with appropriate tribal officials on procedures for recovery or preservation of the
        remains or items (per 43 CFR §10.5).
        3.9.1.5. Prepare and execute a Plan of Action if the remains or cultural items must be removed
        (per 43 CFR §10.3).
        3.9.1.6. Resume the earth-disturbing activity near the discovery, either,
            3.9.1.6.1. Thirty (30) days after the commander certifies in writing that he/she was notified,
            or,
            3.9.1.6.2. When the Plan of Action has been executed, if this occurs less than 30 days after
            written notification of the commander, or,
            3.9.1.6.3. When the installation commander and affiliated Tribal officials agree on a course of
            action that does not require removing the items or remains, if this occurs less than 30 days
            after notification of the commander.
     3.9.2. Consider Comprehensive Agreements (NAGPRA CAs) per 43 CFR §10.5(f) with Indian Tribes
     potentially affiliated with cultural items under Air Force control. Comprehensive Agreements detail
     procedures to be followed in the event of inadvertent discoveries or emergencies related to all land
     management activities at an installation. These are more comprehensive than contingency Plans of
     Action (see 3.10.), since they address various activities as opposed to a specific activity with the
     potential to affect NAGPRA cultural items. CAs require approval and signatures of consulting Tribal
     officials.
     3.9.3. Inadvertent discoveries of Native American human remains do not require notification to the
     SHPO, unless the remains are associated with a larger archaeological site that must be identified and
     evaluated. Such cases will entail concurrent NAGPRA consultations and separate NHPA Section 106
     consultations.
     3.9.4. Installations will ensure that NAGPRA Plans of Action and NHPA MOAs do not contradict each
     other.
     3.9.5. Tribal members may be involved in NHPA Section 106 reviews, but the SHPO has no role in
     NAGPRA consultations and Plans of Action.
     3.9.6. Inadvertent discoveries of human remains that are not those of Native Americans require NHPA
     Section 106 consultation with the SHPO, and possibly notification of installation or local law-enforce-
     ment authorities. Use regionally qualified archaeologists to assist in the decision by determining the
     location, context, and associations (and possibly the date) of the remains.
     3.9.7. Inadvertent discoveries of artifacts, archaeological features, or buried large animal skeletal
     remains not subject to NAGPRA require NHPA Section 106 consultation with the SHPO or THPO.
     3.9.8. Responsibilities and associated duties prescribed in archaeological monitoring plans, inadvert-
     ent discovery plans, or standard operating procedures (SOPs) in the installation ICRMP should be fol-
AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004                                                                                19


   lowed when inadvertent discoveries are made during ground disturbing activities on Air Force
   controlled lands.

3.10. NAGPRA Plans of Action: 43 CFR §§10.3 and 10.5 describe two different kinds of Plans of
Action. One is for removal of inadvertently discovered NAGPRA cultural items (see ¶3.9.1.5. of this
Instruction). The other is a contingency document for a planned activity that reasonably might encounter
NAGPRA cultural items.
   3.10.1. Take reasonable steps to determine whether a planned activity on the installation might result
   in the intentional excavation or inadvertent discovery of NAGPRA cultural items.
   3.10.2. Prepare a contingency Plan of Action when the CRM determines that NAGPRA cultural items
   are likely to be encountered during a planned activity [see 43 CFR §§10.3(c)(1 and 2) and 10.5(e)].
   3.10.3. Plans of Action, whether prepared for individual inadvertent discoveries or prior to planned
   activities, require the signature of the installation commander. Plans of Action require consultation
   with, but not the approval (or signatures) of, Indian Tribal officials [per 43 CFR §10.5(e)].
20                                                                              AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004


                                                 Chapter 4

                                       GENERAL MANAGEMENT

4.1. Aircraft Wreck Sites:
     4.1.1. Note the location of discovered aircraft wreck sites on the installation GIS, or appropriate
     installation map. Wreck sites older than 50 years should be evaluated for significance per Section 110
     of the NHPA.
     4.1.2. Determine if cultural resources have been affected by a crash or by post crash activities such as
     access road construction. If so, proceed with NHPA Section 106 consultations.
     4.1.3. Refer to AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, for Air Force policy on crash
     responses.

4.2. Archaeological Resources Protection:
     4.2.1. Protect archaeological sites on lands under Air Force control or management. Unauthorized
     excavation, removal, damage, alteration, or defacement of archaeological resources on Air Force
     property is prohibited, and punishable by civil and criminal penalties.
     4.2.2. Determine which Federal agency has archaeological resources protection responsibilities (per
     ARPA) on lands shared with the Air Force. Document the determination and responsibilities of each
     party in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or other agreement document between the Federal
     agency and the Air Force.
     4.2.3. Review deeds, leases, and use-agreements allowing for military operations on non-Air Force
     lands to determine proper cultural resource protection roles and responsibilities.
     4.2.4. ARPA permits are required for the actual or attempted excavation, collection, removal, and dis-
     turbance of archaeological resources on Air Force property (per 32 CFR §229, Protection of Archae-
     ological Resources: Uniform Regulations, §§229.5 - 229.11). However, ARPA permits are not
     required for qualified archaeologists employed by, or under contract to the Air Force or its agents in
     carrying out their official or contracted duties on the installation [per 32 CFR §229.5(c)]. Nonetheless,
     32 CFR §229.5(c) requires permit provisions to be met by other documented means, and ensuring that
     any official duties which might result in harm to or destruction of any Indian tribal religious or cul-
     tural site are the subject of notification to tribes as set forth in 32 CFR §229.7.
     4.2.5. The installation commander will ensure that security forces, legal staff, public affairs office,
     and the fish, game, and recreation management staff are familiar with the requirements and applicable
     civil and criminal penalties under ARPA Section 6(a) and 32 CFR §229.4
     4.2.6. The BCE (or Environmental Manager) will issue ARPA permits to qualified individuals after
     technical review of the application by HQ AFCEE.
        4.2.6.1. The reviewed permit is sent by the CRM to the BCE for signature.
        4.2.6.2. The CRM sends one copy of the signed permit to the proponent and another to HQ
        AFCEE.

4.3. Base Comprehensive Planning Process:
AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004                                                                                    21


   4.3.1. Installations will fully integrate cultural resources into the comprehensive planning process,
   per AFI 32-7062, Air Force Comprehensive Planning.
   4.3.2. Ensure that general, non-point specific cultural resource locations are displayed in the Compos-
   ite Constraints and Opportunities Plan as a data layer.

4.4. Confidentiality Requirements:
   4.4.1. Section 9 of ARPA permits the installation to withhold information concerning the nature and
   location of archaeological resources from the public.
   4.4.2. Section 304 of the NHPA, 16 U.S.C. §470w-3(a), also requires withholding information about
   the location, character, or ownership of an historic property when disclosure might cause a significant
   invasion of privacy, risk harm to the historic property, or impede the use of a traditional religious site
   by practitioners.
   4.4.3. Consult with the local Staff Judge Advocate before withholding of any information pursuant to
   these provisions and coordinate, through channels, with HQ USAF/ILEV.

4.5. Cooperative Agreements:
   4.5.1. The Economy Act, 3, U.S.C. §1535, authorizes the Air Force to issue orders to other federal
   agencies to provide goods and services, so long as the order is in the best interests of the Government,
   is more economical or convenient than procurement under contract, and does not conflict with another
   agency’s authority.
   4.5.2. 10 U.S.C. §2684, Cooperative Agreements for Management of Cultural Resources, allows
   installations to enter into cooperative agreements (CA) with States, local governments, or other enti-
   ties for research on, or preservation, maintenance, and improvement of, cultural resources on installa-
   tions.
   4.5.3. Installations may develop and implement interagency agreements or CAs according to these
   provisions, following technical and legal review at the installation and MAJCOM.
   4.5.4. Ensure that principal investigators, crew leaders, and others who will oversee preparation of the
   CA or interagency agreement are qualified under current standards specified in Archeology and His-
   toric Preservation: Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines.

4.6. Care of Archaeological and Historic Property Collections and Records:
   4.6.1. Ensure that all collections of archaeological artifacts and records are processed, maintained,
   and curated in accordance with 36 CFR §79, Curation of Federally-Owned and Administered Archae-
   ological Collections.
   4.6.2. NAGPRA cultural items in the installation’s possession and control will be disposed of consis-
   tent with the requirements of NAGPRA and 43 CFR §10.
   4.6.3. Installation commanders will establish procedures in the installation ICRMP to minimize the
   amount of “material remains” [as defined in 36 CFR §79.4(a)(1)], collected during archaeological
   inventory and site excavation that requires permanent curation.
22                                                                               AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004


     4.6.4. Follow the guidelines and standards outlined and discussed in the DoD Guidelines for the Field
     Collection of Archaeological Materials and Standard Operating Procedures for Curating Department
     of Defense Archaeological Collections.
     4.6.5. Do not establish Air Force archaeological curation facilities on installations.
        4.6.5.1. Exceptions to this curation policy will be reviewed by the MAJCOM and HQ AFCEE and
        approved by HQ USAF/ILEV on a case-by-case basis.
        4.6.5.2. Justification for a waiver to construct curation facilities will include an analysis of costs
        for professional curatorial personnel, initial installation infrastructure start-up costs, and installa-
        tion costs for annual operation, materials, maintenance, and repair.
     4.6.6. Artifacts, records, and material remains related to a historic property are included in the defini-
     tion of that property. Installations must ensure proper care and storage and consult with SHPO on
     ways to mitigate adverse effects to these items. Examples include photographs, blueprints, line draw-
     ings, building or construction elements, etc, associated with historic buildings and structures.

4.7. Environmental Compliance Assessment and Management Program (ECAMP):
     4.7.1. Ensure that cultural resource findings from internal and external ECAMPs are addressed in the
     ECAMP action plan, per AFI 32-7045, Environmental Compliance Assessment and Management Pro-
     gram (ECAMP).
     4.7.2. Program all Level 0 or Level 1 funding requirement driven by an ECAMP finding into the envi-
     ronmental funding portion of the Automated Civil Engineering System-Project Management Module
     (ACES-PM) (per HQ USAF/ILE Memorandum, Air Force Programming and Budgeting Guidance,
     11 Sep 2000).

4.8. Funding Requirements:
     4.8.1. Identify cultural resources funding requirements in the environmental portion of ACES-PM
     (refer to AFI 32-7001, Environmental Budgeting and the detailed guidance in HQ USAF/ILE Memo-
     randum, 11 Sep 2000).
        4.8.1.1. Priority funding includes, but is not limited to:
            4.8.1.1.1. Salaries and training in direct support of cultural resources compliance obligations.
            4.8.1.1.2. Historic building inventory and evaluation.
            4.8.1.1.3. Archaeological inventory and evaluation.
            4.8.1.1.4. Section 106 consultation and development of MOAs and PAs.
            4.8.1.1.5. Cultural resources portions of environmental impact analyses.
            4.8.1.1.6. Approved curation of archaeological collections and records.
            4.8.1.1.7. Government-to-government consultations with Indian Tribes.
            4.8.1.1.8. Initial preparation and 5-year updates of ICRMPs.
        4.8.1.2. Projects and activities typically not eligible for environmental funding include, but are
        not limited to:
AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004                                                                                 23


          4.8.1.2.1. Mitigation measures for adverse effects to historic properties, including archaeolog-
          ical data recovery (proponent should pay for mitigation).
          4.8.1.2.2. Maintenance and/or repair of historic buildings and structures.
          4.8.1.2.3. Routine grounds maintenance such as grass mowing, tree pruning, and landscaping,
          including such activities occurring in historic cemeteries.
          4.8.1.2.4. Restoration of historic cemeteries.
          4.8.1.2.5. Weapons systems acquisition EIAP costs.
          4.8.1.2.6. Projects associated with base realignment and closure EIAP costs.

4.9. Information Management:
   4.9.1. Enter and maintain core data, metadata, and information regarding cultural resource activities
   in the installation's cultural resources automated data files.
   4.9.2. Digital geospatial data produced by cultural resource inventories will conform to military stan-
   dards available through the CADD/GIS Technology Center at
   http://tsc.wes.army.mil/products/TSSDS-TSFMS/tssds/html/ .

4.10. Integrated Cultural Resource Management Plans (ICRMPs):
   4.10.1. DoD Instruction 4715.3, ¶4.3.3, requires ICRMPs to be prepared for all military installations
   having cultural resources. See Attachment 2 for Guidelines for preparing ICRMPs. Electronic tem-
   plates of ICRMPs are available on the Denix website:
   https://www.denix.osd.mil/denix/Public/ES-Programs/Conservation/Legacy/ETB/EtbWel-
   come.htm
      4.10.1.1. Installations will update their ICRMP every five years.
      4.10.1.2. The development and preparation of the ICRMP may require analysis under NEPA if the
      ICRMP contains plans for new proposed actions that may impact the environment which have not
      been previously analyzed under NEPA. When that is the case, the draft ICRMP must be assessed
      in compliance with AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process, as promulgated at
      32 CFR §989. When a NEPA analysis is required, for purposes of alternatives analysis n the NEPA
      document, ICRMP proponents shall develop, to the extent practicable, a range of potential alterna-
      tive means of executing the ICRMP.
      4.10.1.3. Forward the draft ICRMP to the MAJCOM CRM and JA for review. After MAJCOM
      review, installations may provide a copy of the draft ICRMP, or relevant parts of the plan, to the
      SHPO for their information. SHPO comments may be considered, however SHPO approval is not
      required to complete the ICRMP.
      4.10.1.4. The installation will consider MAJCOM and other comments in preparing the final
      ICRMP.
      4.10.1.5. The title page of the ICRMP will include the date and signature of MAJCOM reviewers
      and the approval date and signature of the installation commander.
   4.10.2. Installations scheduled for closure within 5 years pursuant to BRAC laws are exempt from
   preparing an ICRMP.
24                                                                             AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004


     4.10.3. Installations that have completed their cultural resource inventories and identified no historic
     properties or other cultural resources requiring management may petition the MAJCOM for a waiver
     from the ICRMP requirement.
        4.10.3.1. The Base CE or Environmental Director will prepare a letter of justification to MAJ-
        COM/CE requesting the waiver.
        4.10.3.2. The MAJCOM/CE will notify both the installation and HQ USAF/ILEV of the waiver
        and reflect the "No ICRMP Required" status in all relevant program management metrics.
     4.10.4. The ICRMP will be classified “For Official Use Only” and its handling will comply with
     appropriate procedures for documents in that category.
     4.10.5. Annual or as needed updates to the ICRMP will be completed by the installation CRM.
     4.10.6. The CRM will include appropriate justification for contractor support in their program fund-
     ing request for 5-year updates to the ICRMP.

4.11. Integrated Natural Resource Management Plan (INRMP):
     4.11.1. The installation CRM will ensure relevant sections of the draft INRMP are consistent with the
     installation's cultural resources program. Focus on those elements of the INRMP that relate to and
     may potentially affect cultural resources on the installation.
     4.11.2. See AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources Management, for details on natural resources
     programs.

4.12. Metal Detecting: Use of metal detectors on Air Force property is generally prohibited, except
when used by Air Force personnel, contractors, or permittees in association with official cultural resource
management activities, or pursuant to an ARPA permit. Installations may develop detailed rules for metal
detector use on their lands.

4.13. Public Awareness: Establish awareness programs to educate and inform the public about the sig-
nificance of archaeological resources on installation lands [per ARPA Section 10 (c) and 32 CFR
§229.20].

4.14. Reports:
     4.14.1. Installations provide information on their annual archaeological activities to the MAJCOM
     CRM, who then forwards the data to HQ AFCEE. HQ AFCEE completes the annual "Federal Archae-
     ological Activities Report to Congress" for the Air Force [per the Archaeological and Historic Pres-
     ervation Act, 16 U.S.C., 469-469c] and sends it through HQ AF/ILEV to the NPS (RCS:
     HAF-ECS(A)0309)).
     4.14.2. Installations will report incidents of potential ARPA violations to their respective MAJCOMs.
     4.14.3. Installations provide information on their annual NAGPRA activities to the MAJCOM CRM,
     who then forwards the data to HQ AFCEE. HQ AFCEE consolidates the data, creates an Air Force
     NAGPRA Activities Report, and forwards it to HQ AF/ILEV in route to NPS.

4.15. Sacred Sites Access and Protection:
AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004                                                                                    25


   4.15.1. Provide Federally recognized American Indian Tribes access to and use of sacred sites on Air
   Force controlled lands. Sacred sites are specifically defined in Executive Order 13007.
   4.15.2. Impose reasonable terms, conditions, and restrictions on access to such sites to protect per-
   sonal health and safety, to avoid interference with the military mission, or for reasons of national secu-
   rity.
   4.15.3. Avoid adversely affecting the physical integrity of sacred sites.
   4.15.4. Ensure reasonable notice is provided to Federally-recognized Indian Tribes when proposed
   Air Force actions or land management policies and practices might restrict future access to, ceremo-
   nial use of, or adversely affect the physical integrity of identified sacred sites.
   4.15.5. Outline notification procedures in the installation ICRMP. Ensure that NHPA §106 compli-
   ance requirements are met if the affected sacred site is a historic property.
   4.15.6. Take reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of sacred site locations.

4.16. Static Displays:
   4.16.1. Air Force aircraft, missiles, weapons, and hardware on static display belong to the USAFMS.
   4.16.2. The USAFMS is responsible for determining National Register eligibility and for nominating
   USAFMS-owned properties to the National Register.
   4.16.3. Installations will notify and consult with the USAFMS on undertakings that might affect these
   resources, whether or not they are considered eligible.

4.17. Personnel: Qualifications, Training, Certification, and Professional Development:
   4.17.1. An astute awareness of cultural resources management protocols is important in achieving
   program objectives and supporting the installation's military mission. As such, CRMs must be knowl-
   edgeable of the installation’s cultural resources and the appropriate management protocols to effec-
   tively and comprehensively execute program requirements. Given the diversity of cultural resources
   in terms of categories and numbers across the Air Force, qualifications for CRM positions should be
   tailored to the uniqueness of the installation, considering both the scope and complexity of existing
   resources. The Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualification Standards defines the desirable
   knowledge, skills and training background for CRMs. Each installation, however, should assess its
   specific cultural resource management requirements and fill the CRM position according to their need
   and the sensitivity of the installation's cultural assets. It's important that CRMs obtain adequate train-
   ing commensurate with the resources managed. Installations who use consultants to perform work on
   behalf of the Air Force, should ensure they are highly capable and qualified to assist in the identifica-
   tion, evaluation and management of cultural resources.
   4.17.2. Air Force CRMs will obtain certification, education and training appropriate to their respon-
   sibilities and experience. At installations with few cultural resources, most CRM responsibilities can
   be assigned as collateral duties. However, in such cases, the installation should still coordinate the
   responsibilities stated in 1.4.10.2. and 1.4.10.6. with a qualified cultural resource professional at
   MAJCOM or AFCEE.
   4.17.3. MAJCOMs will maintain databases on training and certification available and completed by
   CRMs on their installations.
26                                                                              AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004


     4.17.4. The installation CRM will:
        4.17.4.1. Incorporate basic information on cultural resources into installation newcomer orienta-
        tion briefings.
        4.17.4.2. Conduct periodic reviews of the cultural resources program at commanders' calls and
        other installation forums.
        4.17.4.3. Inform personnel housed in historic quarters about the significance of these buildings
        and explain any special management considerations.
        4.17.4.4. Provide training for maintenance personnel to learn proper maintenance and repair pro-
        cedures for historic properties.

4.18. Waivers and Exemptions:
     4.18.1. SAF may waive all or part of the Air Force's Section 106 responsibility on a specific project
     if the Secretary determines the existence of an imminent major natural disaster or a threat to national
     security (per 36 CFR §78, Waiver of Federal Agency Responsibilities under Section 110 of the
     National Historic Preservation Act).
        4.18.1.1. Emergency action to preserve human life or property will override cultural resource
        preservation requirements.
        4.18.1.2. A waiver will not exceed the period of the emergency.
        4.18.1.3. During the waiver period, implement all measures to avoid or minimize harm to historic
        resources per Archeology and Historic Preservation: Secretary of the Interior's Standards and
        Guidelines.
     4.18.2. MAJCOMs forward waiver requests to the Air Force FPO through HQ USAF/ILEV.
     4.18.3. The Air Force FPO informs the NPS, the Council, and relevant SHPOs within 12 days of
     effecting a waiver per 36 CFR §78.
     4.18.4. The Council may exempt Air Force activities from any NHPA statutory requirements.
     4.18.5. MAJCOMs requests for exemptions to HQ USAF/ILEV must include:
        4.18.5.1. A description of the activity, including its nature, scope, duration, legislative authority,
        level of appropriation, and potential effects on historic properties.
        4.18.5.2. The specific provisions of the NHPA that allows the exemption.
        4.18.5.3. A description of the affected parties.
        4.18.5.4. An evaluation of the potential effect of granting the exemption.
     4.18.6. HQ USAF/ILEV forwards the request through channels to the Air Force FPO.
     4.18.7. The Air Force FPO forwards requests for exemptions to the Council.
     4.18.8. The Council advises the Air Force of the appropriate public notice.
     4.18.9. The process allows a period for public comment of at least 30 days.

Terms
ACES-PM—A sub-module for reporting environmental funding requirements in the Automated Civil
Engineering System-Project Management module. Cultural resources funding requirements must be
entered into this sub-module of ACES-PM to be considered for funding.
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (Council)—The independent Federal agency charged by
the NHPA, as amended to advise the President, Congress, and Federal agencies on matters related to
historic preservation. The Council also administers Section 106 of the NHPA through 36 CFR §800,
"Protection of Historic Properties."
Archaeological Resources—Any material remains of past human life or activities that are of capable of
providing scientific or humanistic understandings of past human behavior and cultural adaptation through
the application of scientific or scholarly techniques such as controlled observation, contextual
measurement, controlled collection, analysis, interpretation, and explanation (see ARPA and 32 CFR
§229.3).
Area of Potential Effect (APE)—The land area an undertaking has the potential to effect. The APE
includes the footprint of the proposed project, and areas around the footprint that might be affected by
visual, auditory, erosional, and other direct and indirect results of the undertaking.
Arrowheads—Used generically in ARPA and this Instruction to refer to any shaped stone projectile point
used to tip spears, darts, arrows, or other thrusting tools. Casual surface collecting (not digging)
arrowheads from archaeological sites is specifically exempted from criminal acts of vandalism as defined
by ARPA Section 6.
Comprehensive Agreement—An agreement between a Federal agency and an Indian Tribe affiliated
with NAGPRA remains or cultural objects, concerning all agency land management activities that could
result in the intentional excavation or inadvertent discovery of Native American human remains, funerary
objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony. The CA should establish procedures for
consultation, treatment, and disposition of NAGPRA remains or cultural objects likely to be found during
any undertaking or action on agency lands [per 43 CFR §10.5(f)]. The signed agreement, or
correspondence related to efforts to reach agreement, constitute proof of consultation. A Contingency
Plan of Action is similar to a CA, but deals only with NAGPRA remains and objects likely to be
32                                                                           AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004


discovered during a specific undertaking or action. Tribal and agency officials (e.g., the installation
commander) must sign CAs, but only the agency official signs Plans of Action [per 43 CFR §10.5(e)].
Consultation—A reasonable and good faith effort to involve affected parties in the findings,
determinations, and decisions made during the Section 106 Process, and other processes required under
NAGPRA, AIRFA, NEPA, ARPA, and other statutes and regulations. Consultations with Indian Tribes must
be on a government-to-government level to respect tribal sovereignty and to recognize the unique legal
relationship between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes set forth in the Constitution, treaties,
statutes, and court decisions (see also Notification).
Consulting Parties—In accordance with 36 CFR §800.2(c), parties with consulting roles in the NHPA
Section 106 Process include SHPOs, and or THPOs; Indian Tribal governments; representatives of local
governments; applicants for Federal assistance, permits, licenses, and other approvals; and members of
the Public with interests in the undertaking.
Cultural Resource Professional—A person who meets professional qualifications in anthropology,
archaeology, history, historical architecture, preservation planning, or other preservation specialties set
forth in Section 112 of the NHPA and Archeology and Historic Preservation: Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards and Guidelines.
Curation—The process of managing and preserving an archaeological collection of artifacts and records
according to professional museum and archival practices, as defined in 36 CFR §79. Refer to Legacy
Resource Management Program Office, Legacy Project No. 98-1714, Guidelines for the Field Collection
of Archaeological Materials and Standard Operating Procedures for Curating Department of Defense
Archaeological Collections," available through the DENIX and AFCEE websites.
Department of the Air Force Federal Preservation Officer (Air Force FPO)—An official appointed
by the Secretary of the Air Force in accordance with Section 110 of the NHPA to direct the AF Cultural
Resources Program. The Air Force FPO is the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for
Installations, Environment, and Logistics (SAF/IEE).
Historic Preservation—Section 301(8) of the NHPA, 16 U.S.C. §470w(8), states that historic
preservation "includes identification, evaluation, recordation, documentation, curation, acquisition,
protection, management, rehabilitation, restoration, stabilization, maintenance, research, interpretation,
conservation, and education and training" regarding cultural resources. The Secretary of the Interior's
Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (NPS 1992) defines historic preservation as "the act or
process of applying measures necessary to sustain the existing form, integrity, and materials of a historic
property."
Historic Property—Any district, site, building, structure, or object included on or eligible for inclusion
on the National Register of Historic Places (National Register). 36 CFR §60.4 explains criteria for
determining eligibility for listing to the National Register.
Identification of Historic Properties—The first step in the NHPA Section 106 process includes
preliminary work, actual efforts to identify properties, and the evaluation of identified properties to
determine if they qualify as historic properties. The standard is a "reasonable and good faith effort" for
identification and evaluation.
Indian Tribe—For the purposes of this Instruction, the term Indian Tribe includes Federally recognized
American Indian Tribes, Alaska Native Villages, and Native Hawaiian Organizations. A Federally
recognized tribe is one the United States government formally recognizes as a sovereign entity that
AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004                                                                                    33


requires government-to-government relations. The Federal government holds lands in trust for many, but
not all, Indian Tribes. Some Tribes are not Federally recognized, and are not afforded special rights under
Federal law. CRM programs on installations are required under various statutes to notify and/or consult
with Federally recognized Tribes (but not Tribes that are not Federally recognized). The number of
Federally recognized Tribes increases as the Bureau of Indian Affairs adds Tribes to the list.
Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plan (ICRMP)—A d o c u m e n t t h a t d e f i n e s t h e
procedures and outlines plans for managing cultural resources on DoD installations. ICRMPs are required
for all DoD installations under DoD Instruction 4715.3, Environmental Conservation Program. The
ICRMP differs from previous CRMPs in that it is more comprehensive, and integrates, and is integrated
into, other land management and development plans at installations. Air Force installations must update
their plan every 5 years.
National Register of Historic Places (National Register)—The Federal government's official list of
buildings, structures, districts, sites, and objects that are significant in American history, architecture,
archaeology, engineering, or culture, and are thereby considered for preservation. The National Register
is administered by the Department of the Interior, National Park Service (NPS). Criteria for eligibility, and
the procedures for nomination, making changes to listed properties, and for removing properties from the
National Register are detailed in 36 CFR §60, "National Register of Historic Places."
Notification—Written notification (vs Consultation) is specifically required in various statutes. For
example, affiliated Federally recognized Indian Tribes must be notified 30 days before a Federal agency
may issue an ARPA permit if the proposed research might disturb or harm any Indian tribal or religious
site on agency land [32 CFR §229.7(a)]. Written notification also is required by NAGPRA for planned
intentional excavation or inadvertent discovery of Native American human remains, and funerary or
sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony. See 43 CFR §10.5(b) for the list of people who must be
notified under NAGPRA. The NHPA requires notification of the Council that an undertaking will
adversely effect a historic property [36 CFR §800.6(a)(1)].
Plan of Action—A written plan, prepared, approved, and signed by a Federal agency official (e.g., the
installation commander), in response to an inadvertent discovery or intentional excavation of Native
American human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony on agency
land. A Contingency Plan of Action is similar but is developed prior to a specific planned undertaking or
action likely to result in the discovery of NAGPRA remains or objects. Both kinds of Plans of Action are
completed after consultation between the Federal agency and a Federally recognized Indian Tribe
affiliated with the NAGPRA remains or cultural objects. The Plan of Action outlines consultation
procedures, treatment, and disposition of the NAGPRA remains and objects. Signatures of Tribal officials
are not required [43 CFR §10.5(e)].
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)—The official appointed by the Governor of each State and
territory to carry out the functions defined in the NHPA, and to administer the State Historic Preservation
Program. SHPOs provide advice and assistance to Federal agencies regarding their Cultural Resources
Management programs and historic preservation responsibilities. Throughout this AFI, SHPO is
understood to mean THPO where consulting a designated THPO is appropriate.
Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) —The official appointed by an Indian Tribe in
accordance with the NHPA to administer the Tribal Historic Preservation Program and assume duties and
functions for tribal lands similar to those that the SHPO has for State lands. The Secretary of Interior
designates tribes with THPO responsibilities. Air Force installations must consult with the THPO, instead
34                                                                             AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004


of the SHPO, on undertakings on or over Indian tribal lands where a Tribe has been granted THPO
responsibilities by the Secretary of the Interior.
Undertaking—Any project, activity, action, or program wholly or partly funded under the direct or
indirect jurisdiction of a Federal agency. Includes projects and activities that are executed by or on behalf
of a Federal agency; Federally funded; require a Federal permit, license or approval; or are subject to State
or local regulation administered through delegation or approval authority by a Federal agency.
Undertaking proponent—The commander, commanding officer, or civilian director of a unit, activity,
or organization, who initiates a proposal for an undertaking, who has command and control authority over
the undertaking once it is authorized, or who has the legal and financial authority to commit the Air Force
to agreements undertaken in compliance with cultural resource laws and regulations.

A2.5. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). SOPs describe internal installation procedures on various
cultural resource activities and requirements. They must sufficiently define steps necessary to implement
required actions during most routine or reasonably expected situations (for helpful hints, see HQ AFCEE
Cultural Resources Fact Sheet: Recommended Guidelines for Standard Operating Procedures in Inte-
grated Cultural Resources Management Plans, February 2001, available at
http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil).
     A2.5.1. CRMs must ensure that SOPs:
        A2.5.1.1. Address specific situations (e.g., training exercises, construction, maintenance, devel-
        opment, demolition, cleanup, transfer of ownership, leases, etc).
        A2.5.1.2. Are triggered and implemented by specific events (e.g., inadvertent finds, weather dam-
        age, crashes, scheduled maintenance, roof replacement, etc).
        A2.5.1.3. Identify specific individuals or organizations responsible for executing each part of the
        procedure.
        A2.5.1.4. Identify tasks and duties of each individual or organization involved with the procedure,

        A2.5.1.5. Link any critical action requiring a decision to a designated office symbol or a backup.
        A2.5.1.6. Identify the primary POC responsible for executing each SOP task.
     A2.5.2. Cite but do not paraphrase or mirror regulatory procedures. This avoids unnecessary amend-
     ments to the ICRMP if regulations change (citation generally do not change).
     A2.5.3. Triggering events for SOPs include but are not limited to:
        A2.5.3.1. Accidents (aircraft, vehicular, etc) affecting historic properties
AFI32-7065 1 JUNE 2004                                                                                  39

      A2.5.3.12. Suspected vandalism or looting of archaeological sites
      A2.5.3.13. Unexpected discoveries of archeological materials during construction projects.
   A2.5.4. Use your imagination to identify as many standard and expected activities as possible to
   address in SOPs.

A2.6. Attachments:
   A2.6.1. Attach any supplemental materials that provide useful references, including:
      A2.6.1.1. Copies of MOAs, PAs, NAGPRA CAs, and other current signed agreements.
      A2.6.1.2. Relevant legislation and regulations.
      A2.6.1.3. Relevant guidance.
      A2.6.1.4. Relevant and appropriate local policy and procedural documents.
   A2.6.2. In a separate volume, or preferably on an electronic medium such as a CD-ROM, compile
   copies of all archeological and historic site and inventory forms. Archeological site locations are sen-
   sitive information. Do not release them to the general public.
