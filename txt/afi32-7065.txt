1.1. Overview. This instruction outlines responsibilities for cultural resources policy
development and program execution within the Air Force. Cultural resources are an
Environmental Aspect within the broader Environmental Management System (EMS). Air Force
Standardized Cultural Resource Sub-Aspects include: Archaeology, Cold War Assets, Historic
Facilities, and Native American Consultations (herein referred to as Tribal Relations). The
objectives of the Air Force cultural resources management program are to meet or exceed DoD
cultural resources measures of merit (MoM; Enclosure 5 in DoDI 4715.16, Cultural Resources
Management) and to support the following:
     1.1.1. Military readiness
     1.1.2. Installation program planning and sustainment
     1.1.3. Compliance with federal laws and regulations
     1.1.4. Stewardship of the Air Force’s important cultural resources for the benefit of current
     and future generations.
     1.1.5. Continual improvement of cultural resources management.
The Environmental Program Group (EPG) within the Civil Engineer (CE) Governance Structure
oversees Air Force responsibilities regarding historic preservation, cultural resources
management, and consultations with agencies, Tribes, states, and other stakeholders. Note:
Throughout this document “Tribe,” “Tribes,” or “Tribal” refers to American Indian Tribes, bands,
nations, or other organized groups; and Alaska Native Entities, which are federally recognized
(see Definitions in Attachment 1).

                                          Chapter 3

             IMPLEMENTING CULTURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT

3.1. Inventory. Through the support of the AFCEC/ANG/AFRC, the installations shall:
   3.1.1. Identify and evaluate archaeological resources and historic properties under their
   control through methods commensurate with Volume 48 Federal Register §§ 44716-44742,
   Archeology and Historic Preservation: Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines,
   July 21, 2003. (T-0).
   3.1.2. Survey accessible undeveloped land areas for archaeological resources per NHPA
   Section 110 and ARPA Section 14(a)-(b). Larger installations and ranges (i.e., greater than
   200,000 acres) will use appropriate sampling surveys and modeling to predict the numbers,
   types, characteristics, and locations of archaeological resources on lands not surveyed.
   Sampling/modeling surveys shall include explicit consultation with SHPO/THPOs to ensure
   a mutual understanding for the portion of the installation’s holdings considered adequately
   inventoried under NHPA Section 110. (T-0).
   3.1.3. Plan and program annual identification efforts to complete AFCEC-approved level of
   survey and sampling each year. (T-2).
   3.1.4. Determine the National Register eligibility of identified cultural resources IAW 36
   CFR § 60.4, and 36 C.F.R. § 63. National Register eligible properties, whether listed or not,
   are termed “historic properties” [36 C.F.R. § 800.16(l)(1)]. Archaeological sites, buildings,
   and structures must be treated as eligible unless or until a qualified historic preservation
   professional evaluates them as ineligible and SHPO/THPO concurs. (T-0).
   3.1.5. Fossils. Title 16 U.S.C. §§ 431 – 433, Antiquities Act, establishes policies governing
   the management, collection, and removal of paleontological resources on lands controlled by
   the installation. These policies must be included in the ICRMP and INRMP. Address known
   and probable paleontological resources in EIAP documentation prepared for actions that
   might impact or cause irreparable loss or destruction of such resources. (T-0).
3.2. NAGPRA Cultural Items (see Attachment 1 for definitions). Installations shall provide
documentation of completed NAGPRA Summary and Inventory requirements to the FPO/TLO
through AFCEC and A4C, if asked. Installations will consult with Tribes requesting repatriation
of the cultural items reported, and follow the steps outlined in NAGPRA Section 7 and 43 C.F.R.
§ 10.10. Installations shall not accept NAGPRA Cultural Items or Remains from non-AF lands
for reburial on installation lands or storage in installation facilities. (T-0).
3.3. Project Review. All proposed Air Force undertakings that might effect on-shore or off-
shore historic properties are subject to review under Section 106 of the NHPA and 36 C.F.R. §
800 and if relevant, the Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1988.
   3.3.1. Installations with ICRMPs shall enter into pPAs with their SHPOs and ACHP to
   ensure all consulting parties agree on communication methods; review processes for Section
   106 consultations and Section 110 surveys, inventories, NRHP evaluations; using Section
   110 survey/evaluation data for Section 106 undertakings; resources and undertakings that
   require Section 106 consultations (and those that are excluded); resurvey/reevaluation
   schedules, and other relevant basic procedures and processes. (T-1).
AFI32-7065 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    13


     3.3.1.1. Installations and their support agencies shall ensure that pPAs are supported by
     personnel meeting the professional qualification standards for historic preservation
     personnel established by the Secretary of the Interior. (T-2).
     3.3.1.2. Procedural PAs will not be used for routine maintenance, management or other
     specific-undertaking Section 106 avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures (aka
     Section 106 PAs).
     3.3.1.3. When more than one Air Force installation is located within a particular state,
     the installations are encouraged to develop a state-wide pPA that includes procedures
     applicable to all Air Force installations in that state. (T-0).
  3.3.2. The installation commander (through the CRM) will identify and evaluate all cultural
  resources in the area of potential effect (APE) of an undertaking, and will take into account
  the effects of all undertakings on historic properties. (T-0).
     3.3.2.1. Installation CRMs will participate in work order review and facility board
     processes in order to ensure impacts to historic properties are taken into account early in
     planning process. (T-1).
  3.3.2.2. Alterations, restoration, rehabilitation, repair, maintenance, stabilization, hazardous
  material remediation, construction of handicap access or other similar actions shall be
  consistent with 36 C.F.R. §t 68, The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Historic
  Preservation Projects. (T-0).
     3.3.2.3. The AFCEC/ANG/AFRC will communicate all relevant operational controls
     associated with Section 106 review to contractors conducting or assisting with Section
     106 review. (T-2).
  3.3.3. The installation will coordinate the following documents: pPA; NHPA Section 106
  agreement documents (MOA/PA); NRHP nomination packages (NRHP), NAGPRA
  agreement documents (CA/POA), ARPA Permits (ARPA), Annual Reports (AR), ICRMPs,
  specific issues packages (MEMO, e.g., eligibility conflict, breaking off SHPO consultation,
  CR taskers, etc.) with the functional offices as shown in Table 3.1, the General Coordination
  Matrix.
     3.3.3.1. Draft NHPA Section 106 MOAs and PAs that concern multiple installations or
     MAJCOMs, HAF or AFCEC centrally managed actions, or actions that would set AF-
     wide precedent or have AF-wide policy implications require technical review by AFCEC
     and SAF/IEE and legal review by AFLOA/JACE-FSC and SAF/GCN.
     3.3.3.2. Draft NHPA Section 106 MOAs and PAs that concern one installation and
     routine matters, e.g., building demolition, real property disposal, or ongoing maintenance
     or training operations, will require technical review by AFCEC/CZ and AFLOA/JACE-
     FSC. AFCEC/CZ shall elevate technical review to SAF/IEE when one or more of the
     following factors are expected: controversy, high stakeholder interest (SHPOs, Tribes, or
     public groups) or national-level historic significance of the properties concerned.

   3.3.7. The installation CRM shall provide copies of each executed PA and MOA to
   AFCEC/ANG/AFRC. (T-2).
   3.3.8. Consultation with federally-recognized Tribes.
      3.3.8.1. Consult with Tribes (see “Indian Tribes”, Attachment 1) pursuant to NHPA
      Section 110(a)(2) and 36 C.F.R. § 800.2 to identify, evaluate, and treat historic properties
      that have religious or cultural importance to those groups. (T-0).
      3.3.8.2. The initial and subsequent government to government consultations with a Tribe
      must be conducted by the installation or wing commander, unless otherwise specified in
      arrangements between the parties, which must be coordinated with SAF/IEE. Contacts
      and consultations with Tribes shall adhere to the procedures stipulated in DoDI 4710.02,
      paragraph 6 and the AFI for Air Force Interactions with Federally Recognized Tribes
      (90-2002). (T-0).

      Tribal leaders that are similar in intent to pPAs with SHPO and the ACHP (see section
      2.3.1.). Tribal agreements should not involve SHPOs or the ACHP, but may be
      developed with multiple Tribes or a Tribe selected by other Tribes to represent the other
      Tribes.
   3.3.9. Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP).
      3.3.9.1. Proponents will ensure that impacts of proposed actions on cultural resources are
      fully considered early in planning, and that such consideration is documented pursuant to
      Title 42, U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq., National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 40 C.F.R.
      §§1500-1508; AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP), as
      promulgated at 32 C.F.R. § 989, and the NHPA regulations at 36 C.F.R. § 800.8. (T-0).
          3.3.9.1.1. NEPA Categorical Exclusions (CATEX). Proposed actions that usually
          qualify for a CATEX may require additional analysis when cultural resources are
          present. See 32 C.F.R. § 989, Attachment 2, section A2.2. A CATEX may be used
          when all adverse effects of the proposed action have been resolved through a signed
          MOA or PA. Otherwise, the proposed action may require preparation of a NEPA
          Environmental Assessments (EA) and Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) solely
          due to potential impacts to a cultural resource. The installation CRM will determine
          whether a proposed action requires NHPA Section 106 review (see 36 C.F.R. §
          800.8(b)). Coordinate any problematic determination with an AFCEC/ANG/AFRC
          specialist and AFLOA/JACE-FSC. (T-0).
      3.3.9.2. The installation may conduct Section 106 separately but parallel to the EIAP, or,
      may substitute EIAP compliance for Section 106 IAW 36 C.F.R. § 800.8(c).
          3.3.9.2.1. Environmental Assessments and EISs for actions producing adverse
          effects to historic properties require an MOA or PA be signed into effect before a
          Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) or Record of Decision (ROD) may be
          signed (per 36 CFR § 800.8(c)(4)). (T-0).
3.4. General Management.
   3.4.1. Aircraft Wreck Sites (primary reference: AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations Reports).
   The AFCEC/ANG/AFRC CRM will evaluate 50 year old and older wreck sites on AF-
 16                                                          AFI32-7065 19 NOVEMBER 2014


   controlled lands for National Register eligibility. Wreck sites must be documented in the
   ICRMP and Geographic Information System (GIS) database.
NOTE: The Air Force generally does not assert title to aircraft that crashed before November 19,
1961 off installation lands. (T-2).
   3.4.2. Archaeological Resources Protection.   Protect all archaeological sites, even those
   determined ineligible for National Register listing, on lands under Air Force control.
   Unauthorized damage to archaeological resources is prohibited, and punishable by civil and
   criminal penalties. (T-0).
       3.4.2.1. Permits for Archaeological Investigations. The installation BCE will issue
       ARPA permits to qualified individuals after technical review of the application by the
       appropriate office at AFCEC/ANG/AFRC. (T-3).
   3.4.3. Confidentiality Requirements. IAW Section 9 of ARPA and Section 304 of the NHPA,
   16 U.S.C. § 470w-3(a), the installation shall withhold information from the public
   concerning the nature and location of archaeological resources unless such information poses
   no harm to said resource and furthers the purposes of the Acts. (T-0).
   3.4.4. Curation of Archaeological and Historic Property Collections and Records.
   Installations shall not establish new Air Force archaeological artifact curation facilities unless
   the need is validated by AFCEC.
       3.4.4.1. Process and maintain all final collections of archaeological artifacts and records
       IAW 36 C.F.R. § 79, Curation of Federally-Owned and Administered Archaeological
       Collections. NOTE: Final collections are those forwarded by contractors or permitted
       researchers to approved curation facilities. Contractors/researchers are expected to
       reduce collection sizes/curation burdens by sampling large collections of common
       redundant artifacts, analyzing bulk samples, culling non-artifacts and unanalyzed bulk
       samples, and disposing of unwanted portions of collections IAW with Contracting
       Officer (CO) approved pre-fieldwork work plans (aka research designs, sampling plans,
       curation plans, etc.), required by each Statement of Work(SOW). (T-0).
       3.4.4.2. Treat NAGPRA cultural items IAW the requirements of NAGPRA and 43 C.F.R.
       § 10. (T-0).
       3.4.4.3. USAF heritage activities and their facilities will not be established or operated
       for the primary purpose of USAF archeological materials and specimens curation.
       Heritage activities should decline donations of such material as most will fall outside the
       activity’s mission and scope of collections. Such items may be displayed at heritage
       activities if relevant, appropriate, and detailed in a current exhibit plan. Account for
       these items as an incoming loan. Refer to AFI 84-103, USAF Heritage Program, 27 Oct
       2004. (T-3).
   3.4.5. Inspections. Cultural resources are an EMS Environmental Aspect and required
   compliance elements are evaluated during Inspector General assessments. (T-2).
   3.4.6. Funding Requirements. Identify cultural resources funding requirements in the
   environmental portion of ACES-PM. Follow the most current authoritative guidance
   published by HQ USAF/A4C for the Conservation Program Element. (T-2).
   3.4.7. Information Management. Installations, AFCEC, ANG, and AFRC shall ensure that:
AFI32-7065 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                  17


     3.4.7.1. Digital geospatial data produced by cultural resource inventories conforms to the
     most current version of the Spatial Data Standards for Facilities, Environment, and

     3.4.8.3. Identify information in the ICRMP that is not releasable to the public (typically
     information on archaeological sites or properties of religious and cultural significance to
     tribes) as “For Official Use Only.” Sensitive locational and descriptive information must
     be compartmentalized in separate appendices. (T-2).
     3.4.8.4. At least every five years, after AFCEC/ANG/AFRC technical review, the
     installation cultural resources manager shall submit the ICRMP to the Civil Engineer
     squadron commander or comparable officer/civilian for approval. Said approval may be
     documented in electronic correspondence; installations shall provide a copy of the
     approval to AFCEC/ANG/AFRC, whichever is appropriate. (T-2).
     3.4.8.5. Installations scheduled for closure within 5 years pursuant to Base Realignment
     Closure (BRAC) laws are exempt        from preparing or updating an ICRMP.
     3.4.8.6. Installations shall request a waiver on ICRMP     preparation if their cultural
     resource inventories are complete and          SHPO/THPO has confirmed that no historic
     properties or other cultural resources requiring     management exist on the installation.
     (T-2).
     3.4.8.7. Emergency Historic Preservation Waivers. The Secretary of the Air Force may
     waive historic preservation requirements in situations of imminent danger from major
     natural disasters or an imminent threat to the national security, or in response to

  Interagency Coordination and Collaboration for the Protection of Indian Sacred Sites. (T-
  0).
  3.4.11. Inadvertent Discoveries of NAGPRA Items (see Attachment 1 for definitions).
  Installation BCE or commanders, with AFCEC/ANG/AFRC CRM assistance, will ensure
  that inadvertent discoveries of Native American cultural items comply with NAGPRA and 43
  C.F.R. § 10. All NAGPRA Plans of Action require installation BCE or commander signature.
  Plans of Action require consultation with, but not the approval (or signatures) of, Tribal
  officials [per 43 C.F.R. § 10.5(e)]. (T-0).
  3.4.12. Personnel: Qualifications, Training, Certification, and Professional Development.
  The Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualification Standards define the knowledge,
  skills, and education background for technically qualified CRMs.
     3.4.12.1. Installation and AFCEC/ANG/AFRC managers and specialists must obtain
     specific training on federal cultural resources laws and regulations, Section 106
     consultations, agreement documents, and Native American culture and communications
     commensurate with the resources managed at their installations. (T-0).
     3.4.12.2. Contracted cultural resource managers or specialists working within installation
     offices shall not be assigned or undertake inherently governmental functions. (T-0).
  3.4.13. Real Property Management.             IAW AFI 32-9005, paragraph 5.8. “Historic
  Preservation Inventories and Reports”, historic properties identified in the RPI require
  physical inventories, i.e., that the property exists, at least every three years.
     3.4.13.1. AFCEC/ANG/AFRC will reconcile the end-of-year ACES report of cultural
     resource numbers and historic coding and advise the pertinent divisions at HQ
     USAF/A4C and the associated MAJCOMs by March 31 of the following year of
     discrepancies, and their resolutions, to ensure the RPI is kept accurate, up-to-date, and
     remains authoritative for Congressional reporting. (T-0).
     3.4.13.2. The installation CRM will coordinate with the Real Property Officer (RPO) or
     manager to ensure that archaeological sites are appropriately located on real property
     records and shared base maps, GIS data layers, and plans. (T-2).
  3.4.14. Management of Marked Cemeteries is not the responsibility of the Cultural
  Resources Management Program. Maintenance and upkeep of marked cemeteries on AF
  installations are the responsibility of HQ USAF/AIS, delegated to the Installation
  Commander, IAW AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program, 2 Apr 2008, paragraphA4.3,
  A4.4, and A4.4.7.). (T-0).
  3.4.15. NHOs are special entities of concern addressed by DoDI 4710.03 Consultation with

Terms
Automated Civil Engineering System—Project Management (ACES-PM)—A sub-module
for reporting environmental funding requirements. Cultural resources funding requirements
must be entered into this sub-module of ACES-PM to be considered for funding.
Automated Civil Engineering System—Real Property database (and Asset Management
database) [ACES-RP (and AM)]—The sub-module that contains all Air Force real property
records and historic codes. In this context, real property generally is any building, facility,
structure, or object with an installation number. Data on archaeological sites, sacred sites, and
TCP currently are not maintained in ACES-RP, although DoD plans to require these kinds of
data in departmental real property databases in the future.
Adverse Effect—Reduction in the characteristics that make an historic property eligible for the
National Register of Historic Places. The integrity of the location, design, setting, materials,
workmanship, association, or other qualities that are important to defining the National Register
eligibility of the historic property is diminished.
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (Council)—The independent federal agency
created by the NHPA, as amended, to advise the President, Congress, and Federal agencies on all
matters related to historic preservation. The Council also administers Section 106 of the NHPA
through 36 C.F.R. § 800, Protection of Historic Properties.
Air Force Federal Preservation Officer (AF FPO)—An official appointed by the Assistant
Secretary of the Air Force (Installations, Environment and Energy) in accordance with Section
110 of the NHPA to direct the AF Cultural Resources Program and MD 1-18, A1.32.3.2.
Alaska Native Entities—Alaska Native villages, tribes, communities, associations, and
corporations are equivalent to federally recognized Tribes for the purposes of consultations
pursuant to NAGPRA and NHPA. Native Alaska villages and corporations include those groups
or communities defined in, or established by, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.
Alternative or Creative Mitigation—Alternatives to archaeological data recovery or historic
building recordation as mitigation for an undertaking’s adverse effects. These approaches can be
implemented as the only treatment option, or may be part of a package where different historic
properties are subject to different kinds and levels of mitigation.
Archaeological Resources—Any material remains of past human life or activities that are of
capable of providing scientific or humanistic understandings of past human behavior and cultural
adaptation through the application of scientific or scholarly techniques. (See ARPA and 32
C.F.R. § 229.3).
Area of Potential Effect (APE)—The land area an undertaking has the potential to effect. The
APE includes the footprint of the proposed project, and areas around the footprint that might be
affected by visual, auditory, erosional, and other direct and indirect results of the undertaking.
Region of Influence (or Interest) (ROI) for NEPA documents may or may not align with NHPA
Section 106 APE, which, in any case, always should be defined independently of ROI in NEPA
documents.
Business Data—Geographic Information System (GIS) specialists think of Business Data as
metadata, i.e., information associated with geographic spatial data. Business data often
describes, evaluates, interprets, associates, references, or clarifies spatial data. Business data also
 26                                                           AFI32-7065 19 NOVEMBER 2014


includes site files, curation data, laboratory analyses, records, photographs, and file information
crucial to day-to-day operations in cultural resources management.
Comprehensive Agreement—For NAGPRA, an agreement between a federal agency and an
Indian Tribe concerning all agency land management activities that could result in the intentional
excavation or inadvertent discovery of Native American human remains, funerary objects, sacred
objects, or objects of cultural patrimony. The Comprehensive Agreement should establish
procedures for consultation, treatment, and disposition of NAGPRA remains or cultural objects
likely to be found during any undertaking or action on agency lands [per 43 C.F.R. §10.5(f)].
The signed agreement, or correspondence related to efforts to reach agreement, constitute proof
of consultation. A Contingency Plan of Action (not used in NAGPRA or 43 C—F.R. § 10) is
similar to a Comprehensive Agreement, but deals only with NAGPRA remains and objects likely
to be discovered during a specific undertaking or action. Tribal officials AND the installation
commander (or his/her delegated sub-commander) must sign Comprehensive Agreements, but
only the installation commander or delegate signs Plans of Action [per 43 C.F.R. § 10.5(e)].
Cooperative Agreement—Agreements between Air Force and other federal agencies or
between Air Force and States, local governments, tribal governments or other entities to provide
the Air Force with goods and services, when such agreements are in the best interests of the Air
Force, and when the process is more economical than procurement under contract. Authorized
under 31 U.S.C. §Part 1535, The Economy Act, and 10 U.S.C. § 2684, Cooperative Agreements
for Management of Cultural Resources.
Consensus versus Formal Determination of Eligibility—A “Formal Determination of
Eligibility for Listing on the National Register” is made by the Keeper. A “consensus
determination” is a written agreement between an installation and SHPO/THPO that a property is
eligible for listing. Nomination to the Register is not necessary with either determination. The
consensus process is not a lower threshold for significance than a formal determination of
eligibility by the Keeper, or the National Register listing procedures. A consensus determination
is a legally recognized finding that a property meets the criteria for listing in the National
Register. Under Section 106, properties that are eligible are given the same legal status as
properties formally listed in the National Register.
Consultation—A reasonable and good faith effort to involve affected and interested parties in
the findings, determinations, and decisions made during the Section 106 Process, and other
processes required under NAGPRA, AIRFA, NEPA, ARPA, and other statutes and regulations.
Consultations with Tribes must be on a government-to-government level to respect tribal
sovereignty and to recognize the unique legal relationship between the Federal Government and
Tribes set forth in the Constitution, treaties, statutes, and court decisions (see also Notification).
Consulting Parties—IAW 36 C.F.R. § 800.2(c), parties with consulting roles in the NHPA
Section 106 Process include SHPO and/or THPO. Consulting parties might also include Indian
Tribal governments; representatives of local governments; applicants for federal assistance,
permits, licenses, and other approvals; and members of the Public with interests in the
undertaking.
Criteria of Adverse Effect—Standards/guidelines used to determine whether the effects caused
by an activity, project or program (i.e., an undertaking that has the potential to affect cultural
resources) will be detrimental to historic properties, in accordance with the Council's regulations
(36 C.F.R. § 800.5). An adverse effect occurs when a project or program alters or destroys the
AFI32-7065 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                         27


characteristics of a property that qualify it for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
This may include diminishing the integrity of the property's location, design, setting, materials,
workmanship, internal composition or association with past events or people. An adverse effect
may include but is not limited to: 1) destruction or alteration of all or part of a property; 2)
isolation from or alteration of the surrounding environment of the property; 3) introduction of
visual, audible, or atmospheric elements that are out of character with the property or alter its
setting; 4) neglect of a property resulting in its deterioration or destruction; 5) transfer or sale of
federally owned, leased or controlled property without adequate consultation on restrictions for
the preservation and maintenance of the historic property.
Cultural Resource—Historic properties (any prehistoric or historic district, site, building,
structure, or object as defined by 36 C.F.R. §t 800 included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the
National Register of Historic Places, whether or not such eligibility has been formally
determined), including artifacts, records, and material remains related to such a property or
resource; cultural items as defined in NAGPRA; American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, or Native
Hawaiian sacred sites as defined in E.O. 13007; archaeological resources as defined in NHPA;
and, archaeological artifact collections and associated records as defined in 36 C.F.R. §79.
Cultural Resources Manager (CRM)—A qualified, trained cultural resource program manager
who meets the Secretary of the Interior Standards and Guidelines for Federal Agency Historic
Preservation Programs Pursuant to Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act, or
who has sufficient historic preservation, archaeological, historical, or architectural training to
successfully carry out the responsibilities of the AF cultural resources program.
Curation—The process of managing and preserving an archaeological collection of artifacts and
records according to professional museum and archival practices, as defined in 36 C.F.R. § 79.
Refer to Legacy Resource Management Program Office, Legacy Project No. 98-1714,
Guidelines for the Field Collection of Archaeological Materials and Standard Operating
Procedures for Curating Department of Defense Archaeological Collections, available through
the DENIX and AF Cultural Resources CoP and or eDASH CRM websites.
District—“A district is a geographically definable area, urban or rural, possessing a significant
concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures, or objects united by past
events or aesthetically by plan or physical development. A district may also comprise individual
elements separated geographically but linked by association or history” (36 C.F.R. § 60.3).
Economic Analysis—A comprehensive report that details the feasibility of preserving or
rehabilitating a historic structure. The study must include the costs to prepare all necessary
NEPA documentation, complete hazardous waste disposal, undertake any environmental
remediation measures, complete a HABS Level I recordation of the property, prepare the site for
new construction, and the cost to dispose of all demolition debris. The report must also detail the
cost to undertake an in-kind replacement of the historic building. Economic Analyses also must
cover all of the hidden costs of building demolition (hazardous waste disposal, recordation,
recycling materials, etc.).
Effect—Any alteration to those characteristics of a historic or cultural property that qualify it for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (e.g. disturbing an archaeological site
feature, such as a house ring or foundation). An effect, whether positive or negative, requires
Section 106 review and consultation. See also Criteria of Adverse Effect.

Emergency or Disaster Situations—In effect when the President, a governor, or a tribal leader
declares that an immediate threat to life or property exists.
Evaluation—Application of the National Register of Historic Places eligibility criteria, 36 CFR
§Part 60.4 and 36 C.F.R. § 63 to cultural resources. A professionally trained and qualified
cultural resources specialist (e.g., historic architect; architectural historian; archaeologist) must
complete this task for the installation following coordination with the applicable Air Force
offices identified in Table 2-1. prior to initial consultation with the SHPO or the THPO.
Geospatial Data—The concept for collection, information extraction, storage, dissemination,
and exploitation of geodetic, geomagnetic, imagery, gravimetric, aeronautical, topographic,
hydrographic, littoral, and cultural, data accurately referenced to a precise location on the earth's
surface. These data are used for military planning, training, and operations including navigation,
mission planning, mission rehearsal, modeling, simulation and precise targeting. Geospatial
information provides the basic framework for visualizing the Earth’s surface. Geospatial data
are information produced by multiple sources to common interoperable data standards, presented
in the form of printed maps, charts, and publications; in digital simulation and modeling
databases; in photographic form; or in the form of digitized maps and charts. Geospatial data are
housed in GISs.
Heritage Asset—See Historic Property.
Historic Facilities—See Historic Property.
Historic Preservation—Section 301(8) of the NHPA, 16 U.S.C. § 470w(8), states that historic
preservation "includes identification, evaluation, recordation, documentation, curation,
acquisition, protection, management, rehabilitation, restoration, stabilization, maintenance,
research, interpretation, conservation, and education and training" regarding cultural resources.
The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (NPS 1997)
defines historic preservation as "the act or process of applying measures necessary to sustain the
existing form, integrity, and materials of a historic property."
Historic Property (or Historic Resource)—“Any prehistoric or historic district, site, building,
structure, or object included in or eligible for inclusion on the National Register, including
artifacts, records, and material remains related to such a property or resource.” (NHPA Section
301(5)). Title 36 C.F.R. § 60.4 explains criteria for determining eligibility for listing to the
National Register. This definition of Historic Property is equivalent to “Heritage Asset.”
Historic Status Code—The official National Register of Historic Places status listed in the Real
Property Inventory (RPI: ACES-RP/AM and future replacements) for each asset. The status
codes are published and defined by DoD. The appropriate entries are determined by the
installation or AFCEC/ANG/AFRC CRM and reflect SHPO concurrence, or eligibility
determinations by the Keeper. Each facility coded as an Historic Property (Heritage Asset) in
the RPI (e.g., ELPA; NHLC; NHLI; NREC; NREI; NRLC; NRLI) must be supported by
appropriate documentation. Facilities coded as DNE must have documentation supporting the
not-eligible determination. https://app.eis.af.mil/a7cportal/CEPlaybooks/Pages/default.aspx
Identification of Historic Properties—A process using specific methods and techniques to
locate and define the characteristics, nature, extent, and boundaries of cultural resources and
historic properties.       (See the Secretary of Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for
Identification). Identification is one of the first steps in the NHPA Section 106 process, which
AFI32-7065 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                      29


includes preliminary work, actual efforts to identify properties, and the evaluation of identified
properties to determine if they qualify as historic properties. The standard is a "reasonable and
good faith effort" for identification and evaluation.
Indian Lands or Tribal Lands—Defined in ARPA as: “…lands of Indian tribes, or Indian
individuals, which are either held in trust by the United States or subject to a restriction against
alienation imposed by the United States, except for subsurface interests not owned or controlled
by an Indian tribe or Indian individual.” Indian Lands include tribal reservations, trust lands,
and “Usual and Accustomed Places” for subsistence collecting, hunting, and fishing. The latter
are often called “Treaty Lands.”
Indian Tribe—For the purposes of this Instruction, the term Indian Tribe (Tribe) includes
federally recognized American Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Entities. A federally recognized
tribe is one the United States government formally recognizes as a sovereign entity that requires
government-to-government relations. The federal government holds lands in trust for many, but
not all, Tribes. Some tribes are not federally recognized, and are not afforded special rights
under federal law. Cultural resources management programs on installations are required under
various statutes to specially interact and consult with federally recognized Tribes (but not with
tribes that are not federally recognized). The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) maintains the
official list of federally recognized Tribes. At present, this list contains 566 Indian Tribes and
Alaska Native Entities (Volume 77 Federal Register Parts 47868 -47873, Bureau of Indian
Affairs, Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible To Receive Services From the Bureau of Indian
Affairs, August 10, 2012 <http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc-
020700.pdf>).
Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plan (ICRMP)—A document that lists/describes
installation cultural resources, defines procedures and policies, and outlines plans for managing
cultural resources on DoD installations. ICRMP are required for all DoD installations under
Section 6(e) and Enclosure 6 of DoDI 4715.16. ICRMP are comprehensive, and implement
DODI 4715.9, Environmental Planning and Analysis, ensuring that installations fully integrate
cultural resources planning with other land management and development plans at installations.
Air Force installations must update or review their plan at least annually on E-PLAN, and
complete major revisions as mission changes warrant. Planned activities in approved ICRMP are
legal drivers for annual program planning and funding. ICRMP must be signed by current base
or wing commanders, and when changes/updates warrant re-approval.
Interested Person or Party—In the NHPA Section 106 process, an individual, group or
organization concerned with the effects of an undertaking on historic properties. These may
request an opportunity to participate as consulting parties.
Material Remains—Physical evidence of human occupation or use. These are artifacts,
ecofacts, and features, from or at the location, or in the context, in which the events occurred.
Mitigation—Actions or treatments that lessen, eliminate, or compensate for the adverse effects
of undertakings to historic properties. These actions may include, but are not limited to: 1)
moving the undertaking to avoid effects; 2) reducing the extent of the effects by redesigning the
undertaking; 3) compensating for the effects by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected
historic properties; 4) preservation and protection actions during actual implementation of the
undertaking; and/or 5) compensating for the effect by documenting the historic property, moving
the historic property to a protected area, or conducting data recovery. This Instruction
 30                                                          AFI32-7065 19 NOVEMBER 2014


encourages “Creative” or “Alternative” mitigation, which can include preserving, protecting,
studying, or restoring non-affected properties substituted for the affected property. Creative
mitigation may involve publishing detailed research, or publically-oriented documents on the
archaeology or history of a region or locale, or creating a scale model or other representation of
the affected property for a park or museum. (See the Secretary of Interior's Standards and
Guidelines Note on Documentation and Treatment of Historic Properties, Historical
Documentation, Architectural and Engineering Documentation and Archeological
Documentation).
The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA)—A federal law
passed in 1990. NAGPRA provides a process for museums and federal agencies to return certain
Native American cultural items -- human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of
cultural patrimony -- to lineal descendants, and culturally affiliated Indian Tribes and NHOs.
NAGPRA includes provisions for unclaimed and culturally unidentifiable Native American
cultural items, intentional and inadvertent discovery of Native American cultural items on
federal and tribal lands, and penalties for noncompliance and illegal trafficking. In addition,
NAGPRA authorizes federal grants to Indian Tribes, NHOs, and museums to assist with the
documentation and repatriation of Native American cultural items, and establishes the Native
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee to monitor the NAGPRA
process and facilitate the resolution of disputes that may arise concerning repatriation under
NAGPRA.
Native American—A person with origins in any of the original peoples of North America and
who maintains cultural identification through tribal affiliation or has community recognition as
an American Indian or Alaskan Native.
Native Hawaiian Organization (NHO)—Defined IAW NAGPRA Section 2(10) “A Native
Hawaiian organization includes any organization that: (a) serves and represents the interests of
Native Hawaiians, (b) has as a primary and stated purpose the provision of services to Native
Hawaiians, and (c) has expertise in Native Hawaiian Affairs, and includes the Office of
Hawaiian Affairs and Hui Malama I Na Kupuna `O Hawai`i Nei.” The Department of the
Interior has interpreted this definition to also include the Hawaiian island burial councils and
various 'Ohanas (extended families). (See Consultation with Native Hawaiian Organizations in
the Section 106 Process: A Handbook; and DoDI 4710.03).
National Historic Landmark—Historic property that meets the criteria of the National Register
of Historic Places and has been designated by the Secretary of the Interior for its special national
importance in the history of the United States. Air Force examples include Randolph Field
Historic District at Randolph AFB and the Cadet Area of the Air Force Academy.
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)—The Federal government's official list of
buildings, structures, districts, sites, and objects that are significant in American history,
architecture, archaeology, engineering, or culture, and are thereby considered for preservation.
The National Register is administered by the Department of the Interior, National Park Service
(NPS). Criteria for eligibility, and the procedures for nomination, making changes to listed
properties, and for removing properties from the National Register are detailed in 36 C.F.R. § 60,
"National Register of Historic Places."
Notification—Written notification (vs. Consultation) is specifically required in various statutes.
For example, affiliated federally recognized Tribes must be notified 30 days before a federal
AFI32-7065 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    31


agency may issue an ARPA permit if the proposed research might disturb or harm any Indian
tribal or religious site on agency land [32 C.F.R. § 229.7(a)]. Written notification also is
required by NAGPRA for planned intentional excavation or inadvertent discovery of Native
American human remains, and funerary or sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony. See
43 C.F.R. § 10.5(b) for the list of people who must be notified under NAGPRA. The NHPA
requires notification of the Council that an undertaking will adversely affect a historic property
[36 C.F.R. § 800.6(a)(1)].
Plan of Action—A written plan, prepared, approved, and signed by a federal agency official
(e.g., the installation commander), in response to an inadvertent discovery or intentional
excavation of Native American human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of
cultural patrimony on agency land. A Contingency Plan of Action is similar but is developed
prior to a specific planned undertaking or action likely to result in the discovery of NAGPRA
remains or objects. Both kinds of Plans of Action are completed after consultation between the
federal agency and a federally recognized Tribe affiliated with the NAGPRA remains or cultural
objects. The Plan of Action outlines consultation procedures, treatment, and disposition of the
NAGPRA remains and objects. Signatures of Tribal officials are not required (43 C.F.R. §
10.5(e)).
Program Comment and Nationwide Programmatic Agreement—Programmatic alternatives
to NHPA Section 106 review developed through negotiations between a federal agency and the
Advisory Council to streamline Section 106 review for a category of possibly significant
resources, IAW 36 C.F.R. § 800.14(a)]. Currently in effect: 1. ACHP, Programmatic Agreement
with DoD, Demolition of World War II Temporary Buildings, July 7, 1986, amended May 1
1991; 2. ACHP, Program Comment, Wherry and Capehart Era Family Housing at Air Force
and Navy Bases, November 18, 2004; 3. ACHP, Program Comment, Ammunition and Explosives
Storage for the Navy (1939-1989) and the Air Force (1946-1989), May 2011; 4. ACHP,
Program Comment, Air Force and Navy Unaccompanied Personnel Housing During the Cold
War Era (1946-1989), May 2011.
Proponent—The commander, commanding officer, or civilian director of a unit, activity, or
organization, who initiates a proposal for an undertaking, who has command and control
authority over the undertaking once it is authorized, or who has the legal and financial authority
to commit the Air Force to agreements undertaken in compliance with cultural resource laws and
regulations.
Sacred site—Defined in E.O. 13007as, “Any specific, discrete, narrowly delineated location on
federal land that is identified by an Indian Tribe, or Indian individual determined to be an
appropriately authoritative representative of an Indian religion, as sacred by virtue of its
established religious significance to, or ceremonial use by, an Indian religion; provided that the
Tribe or appropriately authoritative representative of an Indian religion has informed the agency
of the existence of such a site” (see DoDI 4710.02 and DoDI 4710.03).
Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Federal Agency Historic Preservation
Programs Pursuant to Section 110 of the NHPA—Published in Federal Register (24 April
1998) and in Archeology and Historic Preservation: Secretary of the Interior's Standards and
Guidelines (48 FR44716). The Standards and Guidelines are a series of guidance documents
created by the Secretary of the Interior under authority of the NHPA. The Standards and
Guidelines do not set agency policy but assist in organizing information about historic
 32                                                           AFI32-7065 19 NOVEMBER 2014


preservation activities; in describing steps achieved by federal agencies, states, and others when
planning for the identification, evaluation, registration, and treatment of historic properties, and
in integrating the diverse efforts of the various entities to preserve the Nation's cultural heritage.
Section 106 Program Alternatives—36 C.F.R. § 800.14 outlines a variety of methods available
to federal agencies to meet their Section 106 obligations. Each of these alternatives allows
federal agencies to tailor the Section 106 process to meet their needs. Alternate procedures
include Alternate Procedures; Programmatic Agreements; Prototype Programmatic Agreements;
Exempted Categories; Standard Treatments; and Program Comments.
Section 106, NHPA—“The head of any Federal agency having direct or indirect jurisdiction
over a proposed Federal or federally assisted undertaking in any State and the head of any
Federal department or independent agency having authority to license any undertaking shall,
prior to the approval of the expenditure of any Federal funds on the undertaking or prior to the
issuance of any license, as the case may be, take into account the effect of the undertaking on any
district, site, building, structure, or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the
National Register. The head of any such Federal agency shall afford the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation established under Title II of this Act a reasonable opportunity to comment
with regard to such undertaking.”
Section 106 Process—The series of actions (including consultation, background studies,
surveys, resource identifications, assessments and treatments) that implement the section of the
National Historic Preservation Act that requires federal agencies to take into account the effects
of their undertakings on any cultural resources or historic properties that meet the National
Register of Historic Places criteria. Part of this process involves taking action to avoid or
minimize harm to eligible resources (historic properties).
Section 110 Guidelines—Guidance for establishing, monitoring, reviewing, and evaluating
Federal historic preservation programs. Each program should incorporate provisions of other
relevant statutes, such as AIRFA and NEPA. Published as The Secretary of the Interior's
Standards and Guidelines for Federal Agency Historic Preservation Programs Pursuant to
Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the guidelines define the required
components of a sound federal historic preservation program.
Section 110 Inventories and Evaluations (aka Section 110 Surveys)—Archaeological or
historic building surveys and National Register evaluations completed IAW NHPA Section
110(a)(2)(A) requirements to identify historic properties on agency land to facilitate good
planning and streamline later Section 106 consultations. Surveys and eligibility determinations
for Section 110 must be coordinated with SHPO/THPO and other appropriate parties for
concurrence to ensure future applicability to Section 106 undertakings that occur in surveyed
areas. A key component to successful Section 110 surveys is recordkeeping.
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)—The official appointed by the Governor of each
State and territory to carry out the functions defined in the NHPA, and to administer the State
Historic Preservation Program. SHPOs provide advice and assistance to federal agencies
regarding their Cultural Resources Management programs and historic preservation
responsibilities. The NHPA has been amended over the years, with attendant changes to 36 CFR
§Part 800, resulting in THPO most often being consulted concurrently with SHPO.
AFI32-7065 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                        33


Site—Location of an event, a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building or
structure, whether standing, ruined, or removed, where the location itself maintains historical,
cultural, or archeological value and integrity. Examples are battlefields, historic campgrounds,
ancient trails or gathering places, deposits of cultural debris (i.e. middens or trash dumps), and
historic homesteads and farms.
Traditional Cultural Resources/Properties (TCRs/TCPs)—TCRs are sites, districts,
buildings, structures, or objects associated with cultural practices or beliefs of a living
community that are rooted in the history of the community, and are important in maintaining the
continuing cultural identity of the community. TCRs may be determined eligible for the NRHP,
and as such, are considered under the Section 106 process as TCPs. Examples of TCRs/TCPs
include: 1) locations where Native American or other groups traditionally gather wild foods or
medicines; 2) ethnic neighborhoods whose cultural character is important to those who live in
them; 3) rural landscapes reflecting traditional patterns of agriculture or social interaction; and 4)
landforms associated with Native American traditions and religious practices.
Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO)—The official appointed by an Indian Tribe in
accordance with the NHPA to administer the Tribal Historic Preservation Program and assume
duties and functions for tribal lands similar to those that the SHPO has for other lands. The
Secretary of Interior designates Tribes with THPO responsibilities. Air Force installations must
consult with the THPO, instead of the SHPO, on undertakings on or over Indian tribal lands
where a Tribe has been granted THPO responsibilities by the Secretary of the Interior. The
THPO also functions, much like a SHPO, in consulting with the AF where an installation’s
historic properties are of traditional religious and cultural importance to a Tribe, or otherwise
potentially affected by AF undertakings.
Unanticipated Discovery—Identification of a historic property/cultural resource or of an
unanticipated adverse effect to a cultural resource during implementation of an undertaking.
These may occur with or without prior planning for such discoveries and after completion of
comprehensive Section 106 consultation (including consultation with all appropriate parties).
When this occurs, the finder will cease operations and notify the installation Commander and the
CRM who will follow the procedures defined in the ICRMP and in 36 C.F.R. § 800.13 and 43
C.F.R. §Part 10.4.
Undertaking—NHPA Section 301(7) defines an undertaking as “Any project, activity, or
program wholly or partly funded under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a Federal agency.”
Includes projects and activities that are: (a) executed by or on behalf of a Federal agency; (b)
Federally funded; (c) require a Federal permit, license or approval; or (d) are subject to State or
local regulation administered through delegation or approval authority by a Federal agency (per
36 C.F.R. § 800.16, amended June 30, 2004).
