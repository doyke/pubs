                SECURITY FORCES ADMINISTRATION AND REPORTS

1.1. DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, Issuing Procedures.
    1.1.1. When issuing a DD Form 1408, patrolmen will write, stamp or place a label on the
    back of the pink copy given to the violator with the following: ―
                                                                    If you wish to rebut this
    citation report to Security Forces Administration and Reports Branch (SFAR/S5R), Bldg
    #XXX, within 5 duty days. If you do not notify SFAR/S5R of rebuttal request, it is assumed
    you do not which to rebut the citation. Please notify your Commander or First Sergeant
    within 24 hours or next duty day.‖
    1.1.2. If issuing a citation for a ―
                                       fix-it-ticket‖ each violation must be written on a separate
    DD Form 1408.
1.2. Security Forces Processing DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket.
    1.2.1. If the violator does not notify SFAR/S5R within five duty days of request to rebut the
    citation, SFAR/S5R will complete the administrative process by writing on the back of the
    white copy ―   did not rebut‖ and endorse the infractions on the DD Form 1408. However,
    SFAR/S5R must still notify the violators‘ first sergeant and commander of the violation. If
    the violator is assigned to another installation, forward the citation to the assigned installation
    for action. It is the responsibility of the installation which the member assigned to input the
    citation and complete the administrative action in SFMIS.
       1.2.1.1. Notification to the violators‘ first sergeant and commander can be accomplished
       either via e-mail, base information transfer system (BITS) or official mail; however, the
       process must be standardized and provide accountability.
       1.2.1.2. If the violator does not wish to rebut the violation, SFAR/S5R inputs the citation
       into SFMIS; the Reports and Analysis (RA) clerk will then check the appropriate
       response on the back of the citation and the violator requires no further action. NOTE: If
       through accumulation of points or offense the violator has met the requirement to
       revoke/suspended their driving privileges notify the installation commander or designee
       for approval to revoke/suspend the violators driving privileges. Then advise the
       violator‘s first sergeant/commander (for military members) they need to escort the
       member to SFAR/S5R for issuance of revocation/suspension letter. If unable to contact
       the violator of the revocation/suspension, it will be sent via certified mail.
    1.2.2. If an individual is cited for a serious/apprehendable offense such as drag racing on the
    installation, driving while under revocation, speeding over double the speed limit, the DD
    Form 1408 will be processed though SFAR/S5R as outline in Para 1.5 Incident Reports. The
    nature of these incidents may generate a report. If so process the report and ticket together.
1.3. Security Forces Processing DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, rebuttals.
    1.3.1. If a member wishes to rebut a citation, log the DD Form 1408 into a local suspense
    tracking system and SFMIS.
AFMAN31-201V7 28 AUGUST 2009                                                                    5


     1.3.1.1. If the violator requests to rebut the citation, RA clerks will obtain the answers to
     the following questions to give to the rebuttal authority:
     1.3.1.2. Is the citation a suspendable offense?
     1.3.1.3. If the rebuttal authority allows, does the offender wish to make a personal
     appearance or rather have a written rebuttal?
         1.3.1.3.1. If the offender wishes to rebut the citation, then the unit commander or
         section commander will be forwarded the citation and all evidence for further action.
         1.3.1.3.2. SFAR/S5R personnel will give the violator instructions on how to rebut the
         citation.
         1.3.1.3.3. Provide a template for a written rebuttal. Inform the violator that their
         Commander must endorse DD Form 1408 for infractions the violator wishes to rebut.
  1.3.2. Place the yellow copy of the DD Form 1408 in the suspense file pending disposition.
  Set a 14-day suspense for command action.
  1.3.3. Complete blocks 19-23 on the back of the white copy and annotate any prior history,
  points assessed, and the suspense date.       In the ― Report of Action Taken on Traffic
  Violation‖, black out the words ―  No Action Taken‖; this is not an option. If applicable,
  attach the driving history for the violator from SFMIS. Forward the white copy to the
  violator‘s commander for action. If a DD Form 1408 was issued during the course of an
  accident investigation, attach a copy of the accident report to the ticket when it is sent for
  command action.
  1.3.4. If response on command action is not received by the due date, forward a
  memorandum, which can be electronic, ―  Notice of Late Suspense‖ giving an additional 7-day
  suspense. If the additional suspense is not met, send a ―Notice of Second Late Suspense‖
  memorandum to the unit commander with a courtesy copy to the group commander.
  Suspense extensions will be granted by DFC on case-by-case basis. Notices of Late
  Suspense can be completed electronically as long as SFAR/S5R maintains a copy of the read
  receipt.
  1.3.5. Once finalized, record command action and enter it into the SFMIS case database.
  File the original DD Form 1408 as required by AFI 33-364, Records Disposition Procedures
  and Responsibilities https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.
  1.3.6. Procedures for Rebutting the DD Form 1408.
     1.3.6.1. The violator must submit a rebuttal letter articulating his/her position to the DFC
     through SFAR/S5R within 14-days of receipt of the ticket. The letter must be endorsed
     by his/her commander. The purpose of this endorsement is to ensure commander-level
     involvement. The commander must add comments supporting the violator‘s guilt or
     innocence.
     1.3.6.2. SFAR/S5R will obtain a written statement from the Security Forces patrolman
     who issued the ticket for inclusion in the rebuttal package. The completed package will
     be forwarded to the DFC for his/her annotation/recommendation and subsequently to the
     rebuttal authority (wing commander or designee) for final decision. Once the rebuttal
6                                                          AFMAN31-201V7 28 AUGUST 2009


       authority has made a decision, SFAR/S5R will notify the violator of the final outcome of
       his/her ticket rebuttal in writing.
1.4. Processing the Central Violations Bureau (CVB) Form 1805, United States District
Court Violation Notice.
    1.4.1. Log the CVB Form 1805 into the local tracking system in SFAR/S5R and create a file
    for the ticket in the violator‘s SFMIS records. Each violation requires a different CVB Form
    1805.
    1.4.2. File the pink copy in the suspense file pending disposition. SFAR/S5R will mail the
    white copy to the CVB at the local Magistrate's location; unless another process has been
    determined by the local SJA office.
    1.4.3. The CVB will set a Magistrate Court Docket list and forward it to SFAR/S5R.
    1.4.4. Using the CVB Docket list, pull the white and pink copies for Magistrate Court as
    indicated by the local staff judge advocate.
    1.4.5. After the Magistrate‘s action, enter the actions taken in the SFMIS database. File the
    white and pink copies as required by AFI 33-364.
    1.4.6. Procedures for Rebutting the CVB Form 1805:
       1.4.6.1. Violators who receive a CVB Form 1805 may rebut the ticket through the
       Magistrate Court System on the date scheduled by the CVB. The violator may call the
       Magistrate for additional information on the status of their ticket. Staff Judge Advocate
       (SJA) and SFAR/S5R representatives, along with the court clerk, will take into account
       all information presented by the violator and determine if the ticket merits dismissal.
       SJA has the final word on whether or not to dismiss the ticket. SFAR/S5R personnel
       serve primarily in an advisory and administrative capacity.
       1.4.6.2. If the violator still wishes to rebut the CVB Form 1805 and requests a hearing
       with the federal magistrate, SFAR/S5R will obtain a court schedule through SJA and
       notify the Security Forces patrolman who issued the citation of their scheduled
       appearance. The federal magistrate will make the final determination as to guilt or
       innocence.
       1.4.6.3. CVB provides SFAR/S5R with a list of the status of all processed tickets.
       SFAR/S5R crosschecks this list with the ticket tracker and SFMIS.
1.5. Processing Incident Reports.
    1.5.1. Review reports for accuracy and required information. If a report is incomplete,
    return it to the appropriate office, with an appropriate suspense for returning the corrected
    report.
    1.5.2. Ensure when Security Forces patrolmen enter a report into the SFMIS database that all
    appropriate fields are filled in without NIBRS/DIBRS errors. If a Report of Investigation
    (ROI) is completed, regardless if it is the initial report or follow-up report, ensure the entire
    ROI is entered into SFMIS (to include the synopsis, interviews, etc).
    1.5.3. Establish a 60-day suspense for reports requiring commander action and place them in
    a suspense file. Annotate the suspense date on the cover letter of the report. If prior
AFMAN31-201V7 28 AUGUST 2009                                                                     7


  histories exist, print and attach the history to the report for the commander‘s information.
  (Note: Prior histories are normally provided only for suspects/subjects of the report.) If
  response on command action is not received by the due date, forward a ―      Notice of Late
  Suspense memorandum‖ giving additional 14-day suspense. If the additional suspense is not
  met, forward a ―  Notice of Second Late Suspense memorandum‖ to the unit commander with
  a courtesy copy to the group commander. DFC will extend suspenses on a case-by-case
  basis. Notices of Late Suspense can be completed electronically as long as SFAR/S5R
  maintains a copy of the read receipt.
     1.5.3.1. Incident reports require command action. They must be signed by the subject‘s
     unit/squadron commander. First sergeants or other personnel may complete the
     administrative process of the report; however, the report must be signed by the
     unit/squadron commander. An e-mail with the Common Access Card (CAC) enabled
     digital signature can satisfy the commander‘s signature for closeout of the incident.
  1.5.4. For reports on civilians not affiliated with the base or retired military and their family
  members over the age of 18, forward the report and the CVB 1805(s) to the US Magistrate
  for consideration of prosecution. If the case involves military type crimes such as driving in
  a restricted area, missing ID cards, etc., forward to the base commander or designee for
  disposition. If the report is on a juvenile (under 18) local procedures will identify the action
  authority.
  1.5.5. For incidents involving members from other DoD components, the initial incident
  report will be logged into the SFMIS database. Forward an action copy to the individual‘s
  installation provost marshal/master at arms/military police unit. Annotate forwarding of the
  report in the narrative portion.
  1.5.6. For incident reports involving Air Force personnel away from their home station, log
  the report into the SFMIS database and forward an action copy to the member‘s home station
  DFC for processing. The individual‘s home station SFAR/S5R will track the incident for
  final disposition/commanders action through the SFMIS database using the existing record
  and case number entered by the base where the incident occurred. Do not generate a new
  case. Use the existing case previously entered in the SFMIS.
  1.5.7. ―
         Information Only‖ reports are reports with no subject. Annotate the ―     Action
  Required‖ in the SFMIS database with ―Information Only‖. Provide a copy of the report to
  appropriate commanders upon request or per local policy.
  1.5.8. Reports sent for additional investigation:
     1.5.8.1. If a report needs additional investigation by Security Forces Investigations,
     forward a copy of the AF Form 3545A, Incident Report and all attachments (if not
     received from SFMIS) to Security Forces Investigations. Give Investigations a 21-day
     suspense using a cover letter. Grant extensions as needed to complete the additional
     investigation.
     1.5.8.2. If a report is investigated by AFOSI, a copy of the report with a Request for
     Investigation/Declination cover letter is sent with a 21-day suspense. The letter must be
     returned with OSI‘s Special Agent in Charge or designee written acceptance/declination.
8                                                             AFMAN31-201V7 28 AUGUST 2009


        1.5.8.3. Reports are not releasable until the final investigation is completed IAW AFI 33-
        332 and DoDR 5400.7. Freedom of Information Act. Upon completion of the
        investigation, reports may be released to the SJA, as necessary. Unit commanders
        receive either an action or information copy of the report.
    1.5.9. Reports Not Returned by the Suspense Date:
        1.5.9.1. If response is not received by the due date, contact the investigating agency to
        see if the investigation is ongoing. Keep DFC advised as to why the report has not met
        the suspense and have DFC determine what action should be taken. Extensions may be
        granted on a case-by-case basis.
        1.5.9.2. Keep all correspondence or make a memo concerning any communication about
        a case and file with the report.
1.6. Forwarding/Disposition of Driving Records.
    1.6.1. Upon receipt of PCS orders or notification via Virtual Military Personnel Office
    (VMPF), conduct a SFMIS check. If the person listed on the orders (e.g. to include family
    members, DOD Civilians or Contractors) has a driving/criminal record, attach a copy of the
    orders to the SFMIS printout and forward all driving/ criminal records on file to SFAR/S5R
    at the gaining installation. If the violator has a file (i.e. driving revocation package) that is
    still active, make a copy of the package and forward it along with the orders to the gaining
    installation SFAR/S5R.
    1.6.2. The original case file will be filed appropriately. Document the disposition of the
    record in SFMIS. If the violator has separated, attach a copy of the orders to the current file
    to reflect the new status and possibly a different address.
    1.6.3. If the violator will be separating or retiring, reflect the latest status on all records.
    1.6.4. SFAR should coordinate to get on the virtual out-processing checklist. If the violator
    is pending commander action for a citation or criminal activity then, attempt to place the
    violator on administrative hold until the action has been completed. If a member refuses to
    give the RA any needed information, inform them you cannot out-process them until it is
    provided.
    1.6.5. The Commander Support Element (CSE) must be listed on the Security Forces
    Squadron out-processing checklist for both PCS and TDY. Review the latest admin hold list
    prior to clearing a member. Any questions on if a member can be released consult SJA.
1.7. Parking Monitor Program.
    1.7.1. Security Force units may develop local procedures to develop a parking monitor
    program in a local supplement to AFI 31-204, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Vehicle
    Supervision. Parking monitors must be delegated by individual unit commanders, in writing,
    for participation in the program. SFAR/S5R will obtain a letter with the current monitors and
    maintain the letter on file. The letter should specify a minimum of one primary and alternate
    in the grade of E-5 or above. Parking monitors are the commander‘s representative to issue
    citations for parking violations in areas under the control of their commander. Monitors will
    issue parking tickets via DD Form 1408.
AFMAN31-201V7 28 AUGUST 2009                                                                         9


   1.7.2. Monitors will be trained by Security Forces personnel on the correct way to complete
   DD FM 1408s. The main difference between a DD Form 1408 issued by a Security Forces
   member and one issued by a parking monitor is the special instructions on the back of the
   pink copy that directs the violator to contact the parking monitor who issued the ticket
   instead of SFAR/S5R. It is important that parking monitors include how or where they can
   be reached by the violators. When contacted by the violator, the parking monitor will fill in
   any missing data in sections 1-10. Tickets that are incomplete or were written by personnel
   not designated as parking monitors will not be processed and will be returned to the unit.
   Parking monitors will only issue tickets for areas under the control of their commander. If
   once the violator makes contact with the parking monitor and the parking monitor determines
   the citation will stand, refer to section 1.2. - 1.3.7 of this manual.
1.8. Preparation of DUI/DWI, No Proof of Insurance or Revocation/Suspension of Base
Driving Privileges Packages.
   1.8.1. Prepare a folder (this can be electronic or hard copy) on the individual with the
   following paperwork:
      1.8.1.1. Request for legal review/coordination.
      1.8.1.2. Copy of the preliminary or driving revocation letter (pre-signed by the wing
      commander or his/her designee and normally issued by the apprehending/detaining
      Security Forces patrolman).
      1.8.1.3. Copy of the DUI/DWI, no insurance, driving while license suspended/revoked
      report or ticket (to include any command action already taken).
      1.8.1.4. Any blood test drug/alcohol results (if available/applicable).
   1.8.2. Log revocations and suspensions into the SFMIS database and following routing
   procedures. The installation commander or designee is the final action authority for these
   packages.
   1.8.3. Installation commanders may honor suspensions and debarments from other
   installations on a case-by-case basis per Title 18 United States Code Section 1382.
   Debarments will be processed as outlined in AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, Chapter 2.
   1.8.4. If a certified suspension/revocation letter is returned as undeliverable, ensure
   SFAR/S5R retains the original with the case file and forwards a copy to the Security Forces
   Operations Branch/S-3. If contact is made with the subject on base, Security Forces will
   issue the letter and forward the signed letter to SFAR/S5R for attachment to the case file.
      1.8.4.1. If a military member is suspended/revocated then his/her unit commander or
      designee must be notified.
      1.8.4.2. Overseas locations will develop procedures IAW host nation agreements.
   1.8.5. Update the suspension/revocation/debarment listing as soon as the installation
   commander or designee signs the package.
   1.8.6. Once the letter is returned with the appropriate signature, inform the individual‘s
   commander. The individual and their supervisor must report to SFAR/S5R where the
   individual will sign the final revocation letter. If the person is not military affiliated, send the
10                                                           AFMAN31-201V7 28 AUGUST 2009


     letter by certified mail to the violator‘s listed address. If overseas, local procedures will be
     developed to meet notification needs.
     1.8.7. If a rebuttal is requested, provide the individual with instructions to submit their
     rebuttal letter through SFAR/S5R to the installation commander (or designee) for driving
     revocations and the installation commander only for debarments.
1.9. Notifying State Licensing Offices. Notify state licensing agencies (state offense occurred
in and issuing state of drivers license), by mail, of all DUI/DWI cases as well as revocations of
base driving privileges or refusal to submit to a blood alcohol test. A sample memo is located in
Attachment 2. Telephone numbers for state agencies are located in Attachment 3. Many of
these state licensing offices addresses can be found online.
1.10. Debarment Authority. Under the authority of 50 U.S.C. § 797 and DoDD 5200.8,
Security of DoD Installations and Resources, installation commanders may deny access to the
installation through the use of a debarment order. Installation commanders may not delegate this
authority. Debarment letters will be coordinated through SJA. Documentation supporting
debarment must be kept for the period of the debarment.
     1.10.1. Debarment Orders. Debarment orders should be in writing and contain sufficient
     details to support prosecution by civilian authorities. The debarment order must also state a
     specific, reasonable period for the debarment. Oral debarment orders should be given only
     when time constraints prevent preparing a written order, or the severity of the incident
     warrants immediate debarment. In all cases, debarment must be immediately followed-up in
     writing. SFMIS contains debarment information at most locations.
        1.10.1.1. If practical, debarment letters will be hand-delivered.
        1.10.1.2. If hand delivery is impracticable, debarment letters should be sent by certified
        mail to ensure a record of receipt.
1.11. Preparation of Revocation of Exchange/Commissary Privileges Packages.
     1.11.1. Review report.
     1.11.2. Ensure an on-scene revocation of AAFES/Commissary Privileges Letter was issued.
     1.11.3. Prepare the final AAFES/Commissary Revocation Letter and a copy of the case for
     local SJA and installation commander or designee for signature. This process can be
     modified through local procedures approved by installation commander or designee and SJA.
     Ensure the case is updated in SFMIS accordingly.
     1.11.4. Once the letter is returned with the appropriate signature, inform the individual‘s
     commander. For military members and federal civilian employees on the installation,
     SFAR/S5R issues the final revocation letter in person, with the individual‘s
     supervisor/sponsor present. If the person is not military affiliated, send the letter by certified
     mail to the violator‘s listed address. If overseas, local procedures will be developed to meet
     notification needs.
     1.11.5. If using a pre-signed letter, it should be issued to by patrolman while ―
                                                                                     on scene‖ after
     coordination with installation commander or designee and SJA.
1.12. Certified Mail Procedures.
AFMAN31-201V7 28 AUGUST 2009                                                                      11


   1.12.1. Use the SFAR/S5R certified mail log to document certified mail. Annotate the
   number below the last line of the return address on the envelope. Also, put the number on
   the front, lower left hand corner of the Postal Service (PS) Form 3811, Domestic Return
   Receipt. Obtain a certified mail PS Form 3800, Certified Mail Receipt and affix it to the
   middle, upper and front portions of the envelope. All forms should be typed.
   1.12.2. Prepare a Postal Service (PS) Form 3811. Annotate in section 4a the article number
   (the same control number listed on the PS Form 3800). In section 4b, check the box for the
   correspondence being sent (certified). On the bottom of the PS Form 3811, indicate the case
   number and/or type of incident case the PS Form 3811 pertains to (i.e. I-00-02-050/Driving
   Revocation).
   1.12.3. Type an AF Form 12, Accountable Container Receipt. In the ―
                                                                     TO‖ block, type
   information in all capital letters:
UNIT DESIGNATION
PHYSICAL ADDRESS
AIR FORCE BASE, STATE AND ZIP CODE
NOTE: Each envelope counts as a separate item number. Under the container number, write the
SFAR/S5R log number in numerical order. Under reference, write in all capital letters,
―CERTIFIED/RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED‖ for each entry. After the last entry, type
dashes and the words ―
                     LAST ITEM‖. Finish the line with more dashes to the end of the row.
   1.12.4. Wrap the AF Form 12 around the envelopes, which must be in numerical order, and
   secure them with a rubber band. When BITS picks up the mail, they will acknowledge
   receipt of the forms and leave the top copy of the AF Form 12 in the case folder.
   1.12.5. The Postal Service will return the signed PS Form 3811 to SFAR/S5R upon
   addressee acknowledgment. If the PS Form 3811 is returned undeliverable and is a
   debarment package forward the original letters to the Security Forces Operations Branch/S-3
   and file the envelope along with any other receipts in the case folder. All other incidents are
   filed directly in the case folder.
1.13. Preparing Packages for Filing.
   1.13.1. Once a package has been coordinated, a file folder will be prepared with a copy of
   the report and signed package. Prepare the label and ensure it specifies the deletion date for
   the file. As a reminder, you must follow all appropriate steps before the file can be closed
   (i.e. driver safety course, notification to state licensing agencies, etc). The case is then filed
   accordingly.
   1.13.2. IAW Para 2.19.1., AFI 31-206, Security Forces Investigations Program ―     Within the
   Air Force, AFOSI is the agency responsible for putting data in Defense Clearance
   Investigations Index (DCII)‖. Security Forces will provide original reports of investigations,
   AF Forms 3545A, Incident Reports and CVB Forms 1805 to AFOSI. SFAR/S5R will
   maintain copies of these reports and IAW disposition of records requirements.
1.14. Requests for Information.
   1.14.1. Requests for reports will be processed IAW AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, DOD
   Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement, Department of Defense Freedom of Information
12                                                          AFMAN31-201V7 28 AUGUST 2009


     Act Program, and the ‗routine uses‘ for Security Forces incident reports, including traffic
     violation reports, as listed in the applicable Security Forces Privacy Act System of Records
     Notice located at http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/notices/usaf.
1.15. Conducting Local Records Checks. Law enforcement/official government agencies may
request local record checks. These requests will be written, e-mailed, faxed (on official
letterhead) or in person with proper identification from requester. Criminal checks as part of a
law enforcement investigation require no prior consent from the person(s) being checked. Only
local base record checks can be conducted by SFAR/S5R. Using the National Crime
Information Center (NCIC) for employment background checks is not authorized IAW federal
law, 28 U.S.C. § 534, and as discussed in the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications
Systems Handbook, dated 1 Jan 99.
1.16. Tracking Reports and Statistics. Police blotters are received by SFAR/S5R via e-mail,
on a unit server, and/or hard copy. SFAR/S5R maintains all the blotters IAW AFI 33-364.
Ensure all AF Form 3545A, DD Form 1408, CVB Form 1805, and AF Form 1315, Major
Accident Report, are completed and/or issued into SFMIS or arrange for the responding
patrolmen to input information into SFMIS. Identify all trackable incidents in the blotter and
enter them into SFMIS according to category, (e.g. Larcenies, Accidents, DUIs, Suicide
Attempts, Damage to Property) and for statistical crime data information reporting.
1.17. Destruction of Material.
     1.17.1. All information containing Privacy Act data or sensitive information will be properly
     disposed of as required by AFI 33-364 and AFI 33-332, Para 5.10.
1.18. Disposition of Files from Active to Inactive and Staging.
     1.18.1. Disposition of SFAR/S5R records is governed by AFI 33-364. Blotters are destroyed
     (by shredding) at the end of their retention period.
     1.18.2. IAW AFI 33-364, at the end of the calendar year, reports in the inactive file are
     removed and boxed. Prepare a Standard Form 135, Records Transmittal and Receipt, for
     staging, unless other local procedures are coordinated and approved. Consult the unit‘s
     Functional Area Records Manager (FARM) for directions on completing the form, obtaining,
     packing, and marking the boxes. Schedule an appointment through the FARM with base
     records management personnel for storing records in the staging area.
1.19. Disposition of Debarment, AAFES & Driving Revocation Packages.
     1.19.1. Remove debarment and AAFES revocation case files upon completion of the
     timeframe specified on the folder and put them in the inactive files to be destroyed as
     required by AFI 33-364.
     1.19.2. Driving Revocations are removed at the end of their timeframe and put in the
     inactive file to be destroyed one year after removal from the active file. All destructions will
     be completed as required by AFI 33-364.
1.20. Sex Offenders. There is no military sex offender registry. If the state in which the base is
located requires registration of convicted sex offenders, then a sex offender living on-base must
register with the state. The real issue is who can enforce such a requirement. Enforcement of
state laws on military installations depends on the jurisdiction of the installation (i.e. exclusive
federal, concurrent, or proprietary). The real estate division of the Civil Engineering Squadron
AFMAN31-201V7 28 AUGUST 2009                                                                    13


maintains records that document type of jurisdiction. If the on-base housing unit sits on land that
is subject to exclusive or concurrent federal jurisdiction, the installation commander can enforce
the state sex offender registration laws. Keep in mind that sex offender laws, such as when to
register and how far the registered offender must live from a school, vary from state to state.
   1.20.1. Privatized housing conveyed to a private company, the command has little authority.
   The type of jurisdiction the base exercised prior to the conveyance was lost during the
   conveyance. Therefore, the state or county must enforce state sex offender laws in these
   locations. In the unlikely event that the base and the private housing company negotiated
   what to do with sex offenders, the command may be able to exert some control by enforcing
   relevant terms of the contract. That really becomes a contracting question and not a Security
   Forces question.
   1.20.2. Nothing herein prevents the installation commander from debarring a sex offender
   from base. Such decisions must maintain good order and discipline and advance the health
   and welfare of the base populace, and not be arbitrary and capricious.
14                                                    AFMAN31-201V7 28 AUGUST 2009

MEMORANDUM FOR

SUBJECT: Order Not To Enter or Reenter (Installation Name)
1. It has come to my attention that you [describe incident(s) in detail; for example, "were found
in possession of marijuana at the on-base quarters of Staff Sergeant John Smith on 15 January
2008."]
2. Based upon the above, I consider your continued presence on this installation to be
detrimental to the maintenance of good order and discipline. Effective immediately, you are
ordered not to enter or reenter (installation name) for a period of (state the time frame).
3. If you fail to comply with this order, you will be subject to prosecution under 18 United
States Code §1382, which reads in part:
Whoever reenters or is found within any installation, after having been removed there from or
―
ordered not to reenter by any officer or person in command or charge therefore shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.‖
4. Should you reenter (installation name) in violation of this order, without having received prior
approval, you will be subject to detention by the Security Forces for delivery to the appropriate
civilian and military authorities.
5. If you are entitled to medical treatment at (hospital name), you may enter (installation name)
for the sole purpose of using said facility. To do so, you must present this letter to the entry
controller at the installation entry point and obtain the appropriate visitor pass. You will travel
directly to the medical facility by [describe precise route the individual must travel to go to and
from the medical facility]. You may not deviate from this route nor stop for any reason on your
way to or from the facility.
6. Under extraordinary circumstances, requests for temporary access to other facilities on
(installation name) may be granted. Such requests should be made in advance and in writing
through the Chief of Security Forces, and set out the reason(s) why access should be granted. If
time does not permit, such a request must be made to the Security Forces control center at (phone
number). The controller will then notify the appropriate officials and convey your request.
7. This order will remain in effect [(indefinitely) or (for the period prescribed above)], unless
otherwise modified or revoked in writing by myself. If a compelling reason exists which you
believe should be sufficient to justify modification or termination of this order, you may submit
your justification to me, in writing, through the Chief of Security Forces.
