                                                 Chapter 1

                             POLICY AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

1.1. Policy. It is Air Force policy to identify, classify, downgrade, declassify, mark, protect, and destroy
its classified information and material consistent with national policy. This general policy statement also
applies to unclassified controlled information (Attachment 2) under the purview of relevant statutes, reg-
ulations and directives [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C1.1.]

1.2. Philosophy. Protecting information is critical to mission accomplishment. The goal of the Informa-
tion Security Program is to efficiently and effectively protect Air Force information by delegating author-
ity to the lowest levels possible; encouraging and advocating use of risk management principles; focusing
on identifying and protecting only that information that requires protection; integrating security proce-
dures into our business processes so that they become transparent; and, ensuring everyone understands
their security roles and responsibilities.

1.3. Program Management. The strength of the Air Force Information Security Program is in its infra-
structure. The infrastructure is important because it facilitates effective communication of our security
policies and procedures to those performing the Air Force mission. With the support of commanders at all
levels, this is accomplished predominantly through our Information Security Program Manager (ISPM)
and security manager system. Both play an integral role in ensuring unit personnel know and understand
their role in protecting classified information against unauthorized disclosure [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
C1.2.]
    1.3.1. Senior Security Official. The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/
    AA) is designated the Air Force Senior Security Official responsible for ensuring implementation of
    the Information Security Program.
    1.3.2. Air Force Program Manager. The Chief, Information Security Division (HQ USAF/XOS-FI) is
    responsible for policy, resource advocacy, and oversight of this program.
    1.3.3. Commanders of Major Commands (MAJCOM), Field Operating Agencies (FOAs), Direct
    Reporting Units (DRUs), and Installations. These commanders are responsible for:
       1.3.3.1. Establishing information security programs.
       1.3.3.1. (AFMC) The AFMC Chief of Security Forces is the AFMC Information Security Pro-
       gram Manager (ISPM). The Information Protection Team, Program & Resources Branch, Security
       Forces Division, Directorate of Installations and Mission Support, is responsible for program
       management.
       1.3.3.2. Identifying requirements.
       1.3.3.3. Executing their programs to comply with this policy.
    1.3.4. Information Security Program Managers (ISPM). The installation Chief of Security Forces or
    installation senior security forces official is designated the ISPM at each Air Force installation or site.
    Air Force ISPMs:
    1.3.4. (AFMC) The Information Security Program is an installation-wide program that provides ser-
    vices to all organizations, both permanent and tenant. Organizations which can demonstrate that it is
AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007                                                                        9


  impractical to receive local ISPM support must submit a request for waiver to permit duplication of
  this support function IAW AFI 25-201, Support Agreement Procedures. Specific program infrastruc-
  tures are established for protecting classified information in Special Access Program (SAP) and Sen-
  sitive Compartmented Information (SCI) arenas. The ISPM provides support to these areas when
  requested by appropriate authority within those channels.
     1.3.4.1. Implement the Information Security Program, for the Information, Personnel, and Indus-
     trial Security Programs on behalf of the installation commander. Assist in the program/technology
     protection planning process as it relates to information, personnel and industrial security, to
     include direction on physical security requirements for the protection of assets during the various
     states, i.e., production, deployment, maintenance, test, or undergoing modifications.
     1.3.4.2. Integrate on-base contractor operations into the installation’s Information Security Pro-
     gram in accordance with (IAW) AFI 31-601.
         1.3.4.2.1. Review pre-award and/or draft solicitations and contract documents associated with
         classified contract efforts; security classification guides and Department of Defense (DD)
         Form 254 to ensure appropriate security clauses and/or language is contained therein which
         address the protection of sensitive government information and resources.
         1.3.4.2.1. (AFMC) The program manager will forward necessary documents to the ISPM for
         review based upon the requirement to release classified information with contract award.
         1.3.4.2.2. Serve as technical OPR for the development and preparation of the Visitor Group
         Security Agreement (VGSA) or other security agreements as determined necessary by the
         installation commander.
         1.3.4.2.3. Conduct security oversight of on-base designated “cleared facilities” as determined
         by the installation commander.
     1.3.4.3. Provide oversight within their jurisdiction.
     1.3.4.4. Provide and monitor training as required by Chapter 8 of this AFI.
     1.3.4.5. For organizations at the Wing level and below, conduct security manager meetings no
     less than semi-annually.
     1.3.4.6. (Added-AFMC) ISPMs below MAJCOM level supplement this directive and provide an
     electronic copy to HQ AFMC/A7SX.
  1.3.5. Unit Commanders or Equivalents, and Staff Agency Chiefs. NOTE: For the purpose of this
  instruction, staff agency chiefs are those individuals serving in 2-digit positions reporting to the com-
  mander or vice commander above the Wing level and 2 and 3 digit positions at Headquarters Air
  Force. These commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs will:
     1.3.5.1. Appoint a security manager to administer the unit’s information security program. Alter-
     nate security managers may be appointed as necessary. Commanders or equivalents, and staff
     agency chiefs should consider Air Expeditionary Force rotation cycles, TDY, training require-
     ments, and other assigned duties. Continuity should receive serious consideration in selection of
     security managers. Military security managers must have a favorable National Agency Check,
     local agency check, and credit check (NACLC); civilians a National Agency Check with written
     inquiries and credit check (ANACI), investigation or higher and eligibility for JPAS access before
10                                                           AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007


        appointment. NOTE: Smaller organizations and staff agencies are encouraged to appoint primary
        and alternate security managers to serve multiple activities.
        1.3.5.1. (AFMC) Organizations that generate, process or store classified must appoint an alter-
        nate security manager. While the role of Security Manager (SM) is generally assigned as an addi-
        tional duty, organizations that generate, process or store large amounts of classified should also
        seriously consider authorizing and appointing a full-time security specialist to perform these
        duties.
            1.3.5.1.1. Contractors will not be appointed as primary or alternate security managers. How-
            ever, they can be required to provide other security program support, under Air Force direc-
            tion, such as, assisting the security manager, conducting end-of-day security checks, security
            training/briefings, etc.
            1.3.5.1.1. (AFMC) Ensure that security support contracts include requirements for appropri-
            ate investigations and clearances for access to systems and information used during perfor-
            mance of assigned duties.
        1.3.5.2. Ensure security managers receive training required by Chapter 8.
        1.3.5.3. Notify the ISPM in writing when either primary or alternate security managers are
        changed.
     1.3.6. Security Managers:
        1.3.6.1. Establish and manage the Information Security Program within their unit or staff agency.
        1.3.6.2. Develop and update a unit security operating instruction.
        1.3.6.2. (AFMC) The servicing ISPM will provide technical assistance to SMs as required in the
        development of their security operating instructions.
        1.3.6.3. Advise the unit commander or equivalents, and staff agency chief on security issues per-
        taining to the unit or staff agency.
        1.3.6.4. Attend ISPM hosted security manager meetings.
        1.3.6.5. Update and remind personnel of security policies and procedures.
        1.3.6.6. Oversee the unit or staff agency information security self-inspection program.
        1.3.6.7. Report security incidents immediately, but no later than by the end of the first duty day.
        1.3.6.8. Assist the unit commander or equivalent, staff agency chief and ISPM in monitoring
        security incident investigations. Normally security managers will not conduct security incident
        inquiries.
        1.3.6.9. Participate in security education training as defined in Chapter 8.
        1.3.6.10. Manage the JPAS within their organization.
            1.3.6.10.1. In-process and out-process all unit personnel.
            1.3.6.10.2. Monitor and act on system notifications.
     1.3.7. Supervisors:
AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007                                                                        11


       1.3.7.1. Establish criteria, evaluate, and rate all Air Force employees on their performance of
       security responsibilities [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C1.1.2.1.]

           1.3.7.
           1.3.7.1.2. Civilian. See AFI 36-1001, Managing the Civilian Performance Program, para-
           graph A3.2.8.
       1.3.7.2. Provide and ensure training as directed in Chapter 8 of this AFI.
   1.3.8. Foreign Disclosure. The Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force, International Affairs, (SAF/
   IA), 1080 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1080, oversees the release of all Air Force
   information to foreign governments, persons, and international organizations.
   1.3.8. (AFMC) Forward requests for release of information to foreign nationals or their representa-
   tives to the servicing Foreign Disclosure Office (FDO).

   DC 20032-5000, approves or disapproves historical researchers’ access to classified information.
   [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.2.4.]
   1.3.9. (AFMC) The servicing History Office will coordinate and forward requests for researcher
   access.

1.4. Oversight. In addition to the reporting requirements of the Information Security Program (see para-
graph 1.7.), the following will be implemented [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C1.7.]
   1.4.1. MAJCOMs will incorporate information security issues into Inspector General (IG) inspec-
   tions/reviews. In addition, MAJCOM security forces staff will conduct security oversight and assis-
   tance visits in the form of either an Information Security Program Review (ISPR) or Staff Assistance
   Visit (SAV) to subordinate ISPMs at least every 36 months. MAJCOM security forces staffs are
   encouraged to explore oversight options to minimize resource impact.
       1.4.1.1. ISPR.
           1.4.1.1.1. An ISPR is an assistance-oriented oversight visit for the information security pro-
           grams performed by an ISPM, or designated representative(s) on a subordinate ISPM or secu-
           rity manager. It is a non-rated review for policy and program effectiveness to benchmark
           processes/products, identify problem areas and corrective actions. A key component of the
           ISPR is an assessment of the effectiveness of the information security training program.
           1.4.1.1.1. (AFMC) Information Security Program Reviews (ISPRs) assess elements of the
           Information, Personnel, Industrial and Operations Security (OPSEC) programs, including the
           safeguarding of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Critical Nuclear Weapon
           Design Information (CNWDI) material, for policy compliance and program effectiveness. At
           installations, conduct the ISPR in conjunction with reviews by other functional security areas
           whenever possible to minimize impact on the organization visited.
           1.4.1.1.2. Air Force on-base contractor visitor groups will be integrated into the host installa-
           tion’s Information Security Program unless the mission, operational requirements, autono-
           mous nature or other factors require them to establish and maintain their own security program
12                                                          AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007


            as a cleared facility under the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NIS-
            POM).
            1.4.1.1.2. (AFMC) ISPRs cover protection of collateral classified only and are not rated.
            They serve two primary purposes: (1) Identify benchmark processes/products within a pro-
            gram for cross-feed to all serviced organizations; and (2) Identify problem areas within a pro-
            gram and recommend corrective action. Reviewers are encouraged to use a random sampling
            method, but the examination must be sufficiently thorough to determine the overall effective-
            ness of the program. SAP and SCI classified information security programs are reviewed
            within their respective channels.
            1.4.1.1.3. The ISPM will provide the commander or equivalent, and staff agency chief the
            ISPR results in writing.
            1.4.1.1.3. (AFMC) The ISPR team lead should provide an in-brief and out-brief to the site or
            organization commander or equivalent and provide a final comprehensive written report to the
            commander, director or equivalent as soon as possible. The AFMC report goal is 15 working
            days after completion of the review.
               1.4.1.1.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Commanders, directors or equivalent will review ISPR
               reports and implement corrective actions as soon as possible. Commander, director or
               equivalent endorsement to the report will serve as authorization for corrective action. The
               report and endorsement will be filed in the SM handbook. Formal responses to ISPRs are
               generally not required; however, document and report corrective actions to remedy serious
               deficiencies according to local policy. If required, the organization will submit a written
               response to the ISPM within 30 days of notification. Keep copies of ISPR reports IAW
               records management directives. As a minimum, maintain a copy until the ISPM issues the
               next ISPR report.
     1.4.2. Base level ISPMs will conduct ISPRs on an annual basis. EXCEPTION: An extension to 18
     months may be granted by the ISPM for units that have demonstrated highly effective, discrepancy
     free programs during the previous ISPR. ISPRs/SAVs may be conducted every two years for activities
     or units that do not store classified information.
     1.4.2. (AFMC) The ISPM will make and issue these determinations.
     1.4.3. Security Self-Inspections: Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs involved
     with processing or holding classified information ensure personnel conduct semiannual security
     self-inspections to evaluate information security program effectiveness. EXCEPTION: Activities
     with a small volume of classified material may work with the ISPM to develop an oversight schedule
     consistent with risk management principles.
        1.4.3.1. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs will appoint an individual, in
        writing, other than the unit security manager to conduct a semiannual security inspection.
        1.4.3.2. A program review may satisfy the requirement for one of the semiannual self-inspections.
     1.4.4. HQ USAF/XOS-FI will visit MAJCOMs to review their information security programs every
     36 months.

         1.5.1.1.1. Activities must notify HQ USAF/XOS-FI through command ISPM channels of
         changes to the list of certifying officials as they occur. When doing so, they must also provide
         the position title, activity and office symbol of the affected authority. NOTE: When the
         change involves an activity name change, access-granting officials will sign forms authorizing
         access using the current activity name and a note that identifies the activity it superseded until
         the list of officials is updated.
         1.5.1.1.2. HQ USAF/XOS-FI will periodically update a master list available at the AFSFC
         web site.

                       ORIGINAL AND DERIVATIVE CLASSIFICATION

2.1. Original Classification Authority (OCA) [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C2.2.]
   2.1.1. The Secretary of the Air Force serves as the OCA and may further delegate this authority.
   2.1.2. The process for delegating OCA authority is as follows:
      2.1.2.1. Secretary of the Air Force delegates Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential authority.
      2.1.2.2. SAF/AA delegates Secret and Confidential authority.
      2.1.2.3. All requests for the delegation of OCA will be forwarded through command ISPM chan-
      nels to the Chief, Information Security Division, HQ USAF/XOS-FI, 1340 Air Force Pentagon,
      Washington, DC 20330-1340, for processing.
          2.1.2.3.1. Address requests for original Top Secret authority to the Secretary of the Air Force.
          2.1.2.3.2. Address requests for original Secret and Confidential authority to SAF/AA.
          2.1.2.3.3. Only individuals in senior military or civilian positions (usually General Officer or
          Senior Executive Service level) at the first or second echelon of command carrying out a
          unique mission with responsibility for one of the eight subject areas prescribed by EO 12958,
          as amended, may be designated as an OCA.
          2.1.2.3.4. OCA is assigned to a position, not a person. OCA will not be delegated other than
          identified in paragraphs 2.1.2.1. and 2.1.2.2. above. However, deputies, vice commanders,
          chiefs of staff and similar other subordinates of an OCA are empowered to act as an OCA
          when they assume the duty position of an OCA in an “acting” capacity and have certified in
          writing that they have been trained in OCA responsibilities and classification principles in
          addition to the basic security training on the proper safeguarding of classified information and
          the criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions that may be brought against an individual who
          fails to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure before exercising this
          authority.
      2.1.2.4. All requests will contain the full position title, functional office symbol, a detailed expla-
      nation of why the position requires OCA and an estimate of the annual use of the delegated author-
      ity.
   2.1.3. HQ USAF/XOS-FI will maintain the master list of Air Force OCAs and post that list on the
   AFSFC web site. Periodically, HQ USAF/XOS-FI will request OCA validation from the MAJCOM/
   FOA/DRU ISPMs.
      2.1.3.1. Personnel will submit requests for changes or new requests through ISPM command
      channels as they occur.
      2.1.3.1. (AFMC) Organizations submit change requests through the servicing ISPM.
      2.1.3.2. See the AFSFC web site for OCA training requirements.

2.2. Original Classification. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 2 and Interim Information Security
Guidance, April 16, 2004.]
18                                                            AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007


     2.2.1. Original classification is the initial decision that an item of information could be expected to
     cause damage to the national security if subjected to unauthorized disclosure, and that the interests of
     the national security are best served by applying the safeguards of the Information Security Program
     to protect it. This decision may be made only by persons who have been specifically delegated the
     authority to do so, have received training in the exercise of this authority, and have program responsi-
     bility or cognizance over the information [Reference: DOD 5200.1-R, C2.1.]
        2.2.1.1. Before an original classification decision is made, it must be determined that classifica-
        tion guidance is not already available in the form of classification guides, plans or other memo-
        randa.
        2.2.1.2. OCAs are accountable to the Secretary of Defense for their classification decisions.
        2.2.1.3. In those rare situations where the OCAs’ decision must be rendered verbally due to the
        priorities of an on-going operation, written confirmation will be issued within seven days.
        2.2.1.4. OCAs must notify users when there are changes to an original decision.
        2.2.1.5. OCAs shall be prepared to present, as required, deposition and expert testimony in courts
        of law concerning classification of national security information and be prepared to defend and
        justify their original decisions.
     2.2.2. Classification may be applied only to information that is owned by, produced by or for, or is
     under the control of the United States Government. Information may be considered for classification
     only if it concerns one of the categories specified in Section 1.4 of EO 12958, as amended.

2.3. Derivative Classification. The act of incorporating, paraphrasing, restating, or generating in a new
form information that is already classified, and marking the newly developed material consistent with the
markings of the source information. The source information ordinarily consists of a classified document
or a classification guide issued by an OCA. Within DOD, all cleared personnel can perform derivative
classification.
     2.3.1. Originating Agency’s Determination Required (OADR). OADR is no longer an approved
     marking and should not be contained in any originally classified documents that have been created
     after October 14, 1995.
     2.3.2. X1 through X8 are no longer approved markings and should not be contained in any originally
     classified documents that have been created on or after September 22, 2003.
     2.3.3. When creating a derivatively classified document and using a source document that contains
     OADR or X1 through X8, the derivative classifier will place the following information in the Declas-
     sify On line:
        DECLASSIFY ON: Source marked OADR (or X1 thru X8, whatever is applicable)
                               Date of source: 5 October 1993 (date of source document)
     2.3.4. These documents will be subject to review for declassification 25 years after the date of the
     source document.

2.4. Classification Prohibitions and Limitations.
AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007                                                                         19


   2.4.1. Under no circumstances shall information be classified in order to (1) conceal violation of law,
   inefficiency, or administrative error; (2) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency;
   (3) restrain competition; or (4) prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protec-
   tion in the interest of the national security [Reference EO 12958, as amended, Section 1.7, DOD
   5200.1-R, and Interim Information Security Guidance 16 April 2004.]
   2.4.2. The OCA having jurisdiction over the subject matter determines if information requested under
   the FOIA or the mandatory declassification review (MDR) provisions of EO 12958, as amended,
   should be declassified [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C2.4.3.5.]

2.5. Classification Challenges [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C4.9.]
   2.5.1. If holders of information have reason to believe that the information is improperly or unneces-
   sarily classified, they shall communicate that belief to their commander or equivalent, staff agency
   chief, security manager, or supervisor.
   2.5.2. Send formal challenges to classification, in writing, to the OCA with jurisdiction over the
   information in question.
   2.5.3. Challenges to reclassification decisions are sent through command ISPM channels to HQ
   USAF/XOS-FI.
   2.5.3. (AFMC) Send the reclassification challenge through the servicing ISPM to HQ AFMC/A7S.
   2.5.4. All classified information undergoing a challenge or a subsequent appeal will remain classified
   until a final resolution is reached.

2.6. Security Classification/Declassification Guides.
   2.6.1. Required Elements. A security classification/declassification guide (see Attachment 7 for
   sample format) is the written record of an original classification decision and appropriate declassifica-
   tion instructions and should be issued as early as practical in the life cycle of the classified system,
   plan, program or project. It shall, at a minimum:
       2.6.1.1. Identify the subject matter of the classification guide.
       2.6.1.2. Identify the OCA by name or personal identifier, and position.
       2.6.1.3. Identify an agency Point of Contact (POC) (name, office symbol, mailing address, orga-
       nizational e-mail address, DSN/commercial phone numbers) for questions regarding the classifi-
       cation guide.
       2.6.1.4. Provide the date of issuance or last review.
       2.6.1.5. State precisely the categories or elements of information to be declassified, to be down-
       graded, or not to be declassified.
       2.6.1.6. State which classification level applies to each element of information, and, when useful,
       specify the elements of information that are unclassified (NOTE: only one level of classification
       will be annotated for each element of information.)
       2.6.1.7. State a concise reason for classification which, at a minimum, cites the applicable classi-
       fication category or categories in Section 1.4 of EO 12958, as amended.
       2.6.1.8. State, when applicable, special handling caveats.

        2.6.1.9. Prescribe declassification instructions for each element of classified information.
        2.6.1.10. Identify any related files series that have been exempted from automatic declassification
        pursuant to Section 3.3(c) of EO 12958, as amended.
        2.6.1.11. To the extent a guide is used in conjunction with the automatic declassification provi-
        sions in Section 3.3 of EO 12958, as amended, state precisely the elements of information to be
        exempted from declassification to include:
            2.6.1.11.1. The appropriate exemption category listed in section 3.3(b), and, when citing the
            exemption category listed in section 3.3(b)(9), specify the applicable statute, treaty or interna-
            tional agreement; and
            2.6.1.11.2. A date or event for declassification IAW section 1.5.
     2.6.2. OCA Responsibilities.
        2.6.2.1. It is the responsibility of the OCA to publish classification/declassification guides to
        facilitate the proper and uniform derivative classification and declassification of their information.
        NOTE: In some cases, OCAs may determine that publishing classification guidance in other
        forms is more effective, e.g., program protection plans, system protection guides, AFIs. In these
        cases, the applicable publication will be considered the guide and the publishing requirements in
        paragraph 3.3. still apply.
        2.6.2.2. Each OCA will revise (IAW paragraph 2.6.2.4. below) their security classification guides
        to include an advisory statement in the Release of Information section:
            2.6.2.2.1. Release of program data on the World Wide Web. Extreme care must be taken
            when considering information for release onto publicly accessible or unprotected World Wide
            Web sites. In addition to satisfying all of the aforementioned approval provisions, owners and/
            or releasers of information proposed for such release must ensure that it is not susceptible to
            compilation with other information to render sensitive or even classified data in the aggregate.
            The search and data mining capabilities of Web technology must be assessed from a risk man-
            agement perspective. Information intended for publication on publicly accessible or unpro-
            tected web sites must be cleared for public release prior to publication according to AFI
            35-101, Public Affairs Policy and Procedures. If there are any doubts, do not release the infor-
            mation.
        2.6.2.3. All guides will be reviewed by the servicing Foreign Disclosure Office before final
        approval.
        2.6.2.4. Classification/declassification security guides shall be reviewed and updated, as circum-
        stances require, but at least once every five years. NOTE: Due to the major changes implemented
        by EO 12958, as amended, all current Air Force classification/declassification guides will be
        reviewed no later than 31 December 2005, and every five years thereafter.
     2.6.3. Publishing Requirements.
        2.6.3.1. All guides which extend classification beyond 25 years must be approved by the Inter-
        agency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP). Once the OCA has signed the guide, the
        document will be sent to HQ USAF/XOS-FI who will forward it to the ISCAP for approval.
AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007                                                                      21


     2.6.3.2. The OCA will report publication of or changes to security classification/ declassification
     guides to the Administrator, Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) using DD Form 2024.
     DTIC will require an electronic copy of the guide.
     2.6.3.2. (AFMC) Provide a copy of the DD Form 2024, DoD Security Classification Guide Data
     Elements to HQ AFMC/A7SX.
     2.6.3.3. OCAs must also forward a hard copy of the applicable publication or change to:
         2.6.3.3.1. HQ AFHRA/RSA, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424.
         2.6.3.3.2. SAF/PA, 1690 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1690.
     2.6.3.4. All guides (to include any changes) will also be forwarded electronically to AF/XOS-FI
     at AFXOS-FI.workflow@pentagon.af.mil and AFDO at AFDO.Workflow@pentagon.af.mil
     in PDF and Microsoft Word format.
     2.6.3.4. (AFMC) E-mail an electronic copy to HQ AFMC/A7SX or mail the electronic media to
     HQ AFMC/A7SX, Bldg 266, Rm N208, 4225 Logistics Ave, Wright-Patterson AFB OH
     45433-5760.
  2.6.4. Electronic Location of Guides. HQ USAF/XOS-FI will maintain the master list of all Air Force
  classification/declassification guides and will post all guides on the AF/XOS-FI SIPRNET web page.
  Guides are also located on the DTIC web site. To access the DTIC web site you must have a DTIC
  account. The URL for this is http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/registration.
  2.6.5. Nuclear Weapons Classification Policy. The DOD and the Department of Energy (DoE) issue
  joint security classification guidance for information relating to nuclear weapons. The Air Force
  issues security classification policy (AFI 31-407) for nuclear weapons surety information. Most of
  these products are classified and users will require the appropriate security clearance before accessing
  them. Users may obtain copies of Joint DOD/DoE classification guides through DTIC at a cost. Users
  forward requests for copies of the Air Force security classification policy to HQ USAF/XOS-FI (1340
  Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1340) through command ISPM channels. Requests must
  include the name, address, and phone number of the activity POC, and the POC’s level of access.
  ISPMs will validate this information before submitting the requests to HQ USAF/XOS-FI. For all
  other Air Force or other agency guides, go direct to the originator. Users refer to DOD 5200.1-I, DOD
  Index of Security Classification Guides, to determine what other guides relating to nuclear weapons
  classification guidance are needed. DOD 5200.1-I can be obtained from DTIC.

                                                 Chapter 3

                     DECLASSIFYING AND DOWNGRADING INFORMATION

3.1. Declassification and Downgrading Officials. Within the Air Force, only OCAs have the authority
to declassify or downgrade classified information.
3.1. (AFMC) Declassification and Downgrading Officials. This authority cannot be further delegated.

3.2. Declassification. Note: Exemptions identified in this chapter are found in ISSO Directive Number 1,
Section 2001.21(3)(i).
     3.2.1. Originally Classified Documents. The declassification decision determines the duration of pro-
     tection [Reference EO 12958, as amended, Section 1.6.(a)(4) and ISOO Directive Number 1, Section
     2001.12.]. At the time an item of information is classified, original classifiers will determine which of
     the following four declassification instructions will be used, selecting whenever possible, the declas-
     sification instruction that will result in the shortest duration of classification.
        3.2.1.1. A date or event less than 10 years from the date of the document; or, if unable to identify
        such a date or event;
        3.2.1.2. A date 10 years from the date of the document; or
        3.2.1.3. A date greater than 10 and less than 25 years from the date of the document; or
        3.2.1.4. A date 25 years from the date of the document.
     3.2.2. Derivatively Classified Documents. The “Declassify on” line must include one of the follow-
     ing:
        3.2.2.1. The date or event up to 25 years, as noted on the source document; or
        3.2.2.2. Source marked OADR, date of source (cannot be a date after October 1995); or
        3.2.2.3. Source marked X1-X8, date of source (cannot be a date after September 2003); or
        3.2.2.4. 25X1 through 25X9, and a specific date or event for declassification; or
        3.2.2.5. 25X1-human (the only category that does not require a date or event follow it).

3.3. Exceptions. RD/FRD [Reference 10 CFR 1045.1 Subpart A]. Documents containing RD or FRD
are excluded from automatic declassification and do not require a declassification date. RD must be
reviewed by the DoE prior to release. DoE and DOD must jointly review documents containing FRD
prior to release.

3.4. Automatic Declassification. IAW EO 12958, as amended, Section 3.3, all Air Force activities that
possess classified information that is of permanent historical value and is 25 years old or older should
have completed a declassification review of these documents by 31 Dec 2006.
     3.4.1. The Air Force Declassification Office (AFDO) has published the Air Force Declassification
     Plan that provides the framework for Air Force compliance with Section 3.3 of EO 12958, as
     amended. It pertains to all classified Air Force records that are 25 years old or older as of 31 Decem-
     ber 2006, and have been determined under Federal law to have permanent historical value. The Air
AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007                                                                         23


   Force Declassification Plan is posted at the AFDO web site (http://www.afdo.hq.af.mil/Plan.htm).
   It is critical that records management and information security personnel work together to ensure that
   requirements of both are met on classified records that are going to be sent to the National Archives or
   Federal Records Center.
   3.4.2. All classified records shall be automatically declassified on 31 December of the year that is 25
   years from the date of its original classification, unless it falls in one of the exemption categories
   (25X) listed in Section 3.3(b) of EO 12958, as amended.
   3.4.3. The 25X categories cannot be used unless the specific information has been approved through
   the ISCAP process. This is usually done in the form of a security classification/declassification guide.
   (See paragraph 2.6. and Attachment 7.) The Air Force has an approved list of exemption categories
   (listed in the Air Force Declassification Plan); however, the specific item must still be annotated in the
   security classification/ declassification guide before it is used on derivatively marked documents. For
   original classification decisions, no 25X marking, other than “25X1-human,” is permitted on the
   “declassify on” line. All originally classified documents will contain either a date or event less than 10
   years or a date from 10 to 25 years. The only exception is the marking “25X1-human.” This marking
   may be used when the disclosure of the information could be expected to reveal the identity of a con-
   fidential human source or human intelligence source. This is the only 25X marking that does not
   require a date or event for declassification to be cited with the 25X marking.

3.5. Mandatory Review.
   3.5.1. Mandatory review requests must identify the information requested with enough specificity to
   allow for location of the records with a reasonable amount of effort.
   3.5.1. (AFMC) HAF/ICIOD forwards requests for Mandatory Declassification Reviews (MDRs)
   involving collateral classified information to the ISPM servicing the appropriate Original Classifica-
   tion Authority (OCA). When HAF/ICIOD cannot readily determine the appropriate OCA, they for-
   ward the MDR to HQ AFMC/A7S for further distribution. HQ AFMC/A7S forwards the MDR to the
   servicing ISPM with distribution instructions and a suspense date. The servicing ISPM provides clas-
   sification management assistance as requested by the OCA conducting the MDR. Ensure MDRs
   involving SCI or SAP information remain within those program channels.
   3.5.2. Send all requests for MDR to 11 CS/SCSL (MDR), 1000 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC
   20330-1000.
   3.5.3. Send appeals to MDR decisions through 11 CS/SCSL (MDR) to SAF/AA, the Air Force
   Appellate Authority for MDRs.

3.6. Systematic Review for Declassification. Activities will set up an annual schedule for conducting
systematic declassification reviews for the following records:
   3.6.1. Records of permanent historical value prior to their twenty-fifth birthday. These records will be
   reviewed and appropriate action taken by 31 Dec of the same year that is 25 years from the date of its
   original classification.
   3.6.2. Other records. Activities will set up a reasonable schedule for conducting declassification
   reviews for all other classified records.
24                                                            AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007


3.7. Referrals. A referral is information that is subject to the provisions of EO 12958, as amended, Sec-
tion 3.3, Automatic Declassification, and ISOO Directive No. 1, Section 2001.34, and has been referred
to, within, or outside the Air Force for review. AFDO is the focal point for processing Air Force referrals.
Detailed information regarding the referral process can be found in the Air Force Declassification Plan.

3.8. Public Release. When information is declassified, it is not releasable to the public until it has been
approved for release through the security review process IAW AFI 35-101, Chapter 15. The same holds
true for declassified or unclassified information that will be placed on an Internet site that can be accessed
by the public.

3.9. Downgrading. Downgrading of information to a lower level of classification is appropriate when
the information no longer requires protection at the originally assigned level, and can be properly pro-
tected at a lower level. Any official who is authorized to classify or declassify the information and has
authority over the information may downgrade information.
AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007                                                                        25

                                              MARKINGS

4.1. General. Air Force personnel who originally and derivatively classify information will mark those
products according to DOD 5200.1-R and the ISOO Marking Booklet. Material other than ordinary paper
documents, e.g., e-mail transmitted over a secure network, must have the same information either marked
on it or made immediately available to holders by other means. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.1.]

4.2. Required Markings. Classified documents are required to have the following markings:
   4.2.1. The overall classification of the document.
   4.2.2. The agency, office of origin, and date of the document.
   4.2.3. The office or source document that classified the information.
       4.2.3.1. If it is originally classified, the document will reference the office. Example:
                                   CLASSIFIED BY: HQ USAF/XO
       4.2.3.2. If a document is derivatively classified, it will reference the source document or the secu-
       rity classification/declassification guide. Example:
                    DERIVED FROM: HQ USAF/XO Memo dated 12 Jan 2003
                                        Subj: Funding Problems
   4.2.4. The reason for classification. Each originally classified document shall bear a concise state-
   ment of the reason for classification, determined by the original classifier. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
   C5.2.4.] The classification categories are listed in EO 12958, as amended, Section 1.4; DOD
   5200.1-R Interim Information Security Guidance, Chapter 2, Para 1. Example:
                                            REASON: 1.4(e)
       4.2.4.1. If a document is derivatively classified, the “REASON” is not required to be carried over
       to the derivative document.
   4.2.5. Declassification instructions, and any downgrading instructions that apply. Example:
                                 DECLASSIFY ON: 15 MARCH 2010
       4.2.5.1. If marking material that falls within one of the 25-year exemption categories, the correct
       marking will be as follows (NOTE: only derivatively classified documents will carry a 25X mark-
       ing, with the exception of 25X1-human, which is allowed on originally classified documents):
                             DECLASSIFY ON: 25X5, 15 February 2010
   4.2.6. Page and portion markings to identify the specific classified information in the document and
   its level of classification. When marking a document that is derivatively classified, ensure all mark-
   ings and caveats are carried over from the source document to the derivative document.
   4.2.7. Control notices and other markings that apply to the document.
   4.2.8. When a document has been declassified or downgraded, the following markings shall be
   applied:
26                                                            AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007


        4.2.8.1. The word “Declassified” or the new classification if being downgraded.
        4.2.8.2. The authority for the action (the OCA’s office symbol and the identification of the corre-
        spondence or classification instruction that required it).
        4.2.8.3. The date of declassification or downgrading action.
        4.2.8.4. The overall classification markings that appear on the cover page or first page shall be
        marked through with a straight line. If downgraded, the new classification will be written in.
        4.2.8.5. Page and portion markings will be remarked as required.
     4.2.9. Notebooks, binders, folders, etc. containing classified documents will be conspicuously
     marked with the highest classification of the material contained. Affix the appropriate overall classifi-
     cation marking or classified cover sheet to the front and back of the notebook, binder, folder, etc.
     4.2.9. (AFMC) The last page of a document will be considered its back cover unless there is a clearly
     discernible separate page serving as the cover. Mark the back cover, whether paper or card stock, as
     required in the basic directive.
     4.2.10. (Added-AFMC) Mark file folders containing classified information on the top edges, as well
     as the front and back of the folder, with the highest level of classified material contained therein.

4.3. Special Control and Similar Notices. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.2.9.]
     4.3.1. Working Papers. Working papers are documents and material accumulated or created in the
     preparation of finished documents and material. Working papers containing classified information
     will be:
        4.3.1.1. Dated when created.
        4.3.1.1. (AFMC) Include name, organization and office symbol.
        4.3.1.2. Marked with the highest classification of any information contained in the document and
        annotated “WORKING PAPER”.
        4.3.1.3. Destroyed when no longer needed.
        4.3.1.4. Protected IAW the assigned classification.
        4.3.1.5. Marked in the same manner as a finished document at the same classification level when
        transmitted outside the facility or if retained for more than 180 days from the original creation
        date.
     4.3.2. Communications Security (COMSEC). See AFI 33-211, Communications Security (COMSEC)
     User Requirements, for guidance on marking COMSEC documents and media.
     4.3.3. Technical Documents. See AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific and Technical Information,
     for guidance on marking and disseminating technical documents. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, para-
     graph C5.2.9.8. and DODD 5230.24, Distribution Statements on Technical Documents.]
     4.3.4. SAPs. Documentation and information may be identified with the Phrase “Special Access
     Required” and the assigned nickname, codeword, trigraph, or digraph. See AFI 16-701, Special
     Access Programs, for additional guidance on SAP documents.
     4.3.5. Restricted Data/Formerly Restricted Data (RD/FRD). [Reference 10 CFR 1045.1, Subpart A.)
AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007                                                                         27


       4.3.5.1. Documents containing RD shall be marked:


                                         RESTRICTED DATA


      “This material contains Restricted Data as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.
          Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal sanctions.”
       4.3.5.2. Documents containing FRD shall be marked:


                                 FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA


      “Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal sanctions. Handle as
       Restricted Data in foreign dissemination. Section 144.b, Atomic Energy Act, 1954”
   4.3.6. For Official Use Only (FOUO). See chapter 4 of DOD 5400.7/AF Supplement.

4.4. NATO. NATO documents should be marked in compliance with AFI 31-406, Applying North Atlan-
tic Treaty Organization (NATO) Protection Standards, USSAN Instruction 1-69, United States Imple-
mentation of NATO Security Procedures, and C-M(2002)49, Security Within the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). Any new policies, principles, standards, and procedures contained in
C-M(2002)49 and it’s supporting directives take precedence, where they conflict, over the guidelines
expressed in USSAN 1-69, dated 21 April 1982.

4.5. Other Foreign Government Information (FGI).
   4.5.1. Classification designations for FGI often do not parallel U.S. classification designations. More-
   over, many foreign governments and international organizations have a fourth level of classification
   that generally translates as "Restricted," and a category of unclassified information that is protected by
   law in the originating country and is provided on the condition that it will be treated "in confidence."
   A table of U.S. and foreign government classification markings can be found in DOD 5200.1-R,
   Appendix 6.
   4.5.2. Other foreign government classified documents shall be marked in English to identify the orig-
   inating country and the applicable U.S. classification designation. If a classification designation has
   been applied to a foreign document by the originator, and it is the applicable U.S. English language
   designation, only the identity of the originating country need be applied to the document. Examples:
      A German document marked "Geheim" would be marked: DEU SECRET.
      A UK document marked "SECRET" would be marked: GBR SECRET.
   4.5.3. Foreign government documents that are marked with a classification designation that equates
   to Restricted, and unclassified foreign government documents that are provided to a DOD Component
   on the condition that they will be treated "in confidence," shall be marked to identify the originating
   government and whether they are Restricted or provided "in confidence." Additionally, they shall be
   marked "CONFIDENTIAL - Modified Handling". Example:
28                                                             AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007


                   A French document marked "Diffusion Restreinte” would be marked:


                               FRENCH RESTRICTED INFORMATION
                                                 Protect as:
                                 CONFIDENTIAL - Modified Handling


        4.5.3.1. (Ref: DOD 5200.1-R, para C6.6.3.) In order to ensure the protection of FGI provided in
        confidence (e.g., foreign government "Restricted," or foreign government unclassified informa-
        tion provided in confidence), such information must be classified under EO 12958, as amended.
        Provide a degree of protection to the FGI at least equivalent to that required by the foreign govern-
        ment or international organization that provided the information. If the foreign protection require-
        ment is lower than the protection required for U.S. CONFIDENTIAL information, the following
        requirements shall be met:
            4.5.3.1.1. The information shall be provided only to those individuals who have a
            need-to-know and access is required by official duties.
            4.5.3.1.2. Individuals given access shall be notified of applicable handling instructions.
            4.5.3.1.3. Documents shall be stored so as to prevent unauthorized access.

4.6. Marking of Foreign Government and NATO Information In DOD Documents.
     4.6.1. When used in DOD documents, FGI must be marked to prevent premature declassification or
     unauthorized disclosure. To satisfy this requirement, U.S. documents that contain FGI shall be
     marked on the cover or first page, "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS (indicate country of origin)
     INFORMATION." In addition, the portions shall be marked to identify the classification level and
     the country of origin, e.g., (GBR-C); (DEU-C). If the identity of the foreign government must be con-
     cealed, the cover or first page of the document shall be marked, "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS
     FOREIGN GOVERNMENT INFORMATION," and applicable paragraphs shall be marked FGI
     together with the appropriate classification (FGI-S). The identity of the foreign government shall be
     maintained with the record copy, which must be appropriately protected.
     4.6.2. The "Derived From" line shall identify the U.S. as well as foreign classification sources. If the
     identity of the foreign government must be concealed, the "Derived From" line shall contain the mark-
     ing "Foreign Government information." In that case, the identity of the foreign government will be
     maintained with the record copy and protected appropriately. A U.S. document shall not be down-
     graded below the highest level of FGI contained in the document or be declassified without the written
     approval of the foreign government that originated the information. Recommendations concerning
     downgrading or declassification shall be submitted through the DOD entity that created the document
     to the originating foreign government.
     4.6.3. DOD classified documents that contain extracts of NATO classified information shall be
     marked as follows on the cover or first page: "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS NATO CLASSI-
     FIED INFORMATION." Portions shall be marked to identify the NATO information (e.g., NS).
     When NATO or other foreign government RESTRICTED information is included in otherwise
     unclassified DOD documents, the following statement shall be affixed to the top and bottom of the
AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007                                                                         29


   page containing the information: "This page contains (indicate NATO or country of origin)
   RESTRICTED information." The restricted portions shall be marked (e.g., (NR) (GBR-R). The
   cover, (or first page, if no cover) of the document shall contain the following statement: "This docu-
   ment contains NATO RESTRICTED information not marked for declassification (date of
   source) and shall be safeguarded in accordance with USSAN 1-69."
   4.6.4. Other foreign government classified documents should be marked in English to identify the
   originating country and the applicable U.S. classification designation.
   4.6.5. Foreign government documents that are marked with a classification designation that equates
   to RESTRICTED, and unclassified foreign government documents that are provided to a DOD com-
   ponent, should be marked to identify the originating government and whether they are restricted or
   provided in confidence.

4.7. Audio and Video Tapes. Personnel responsible for marking and maintaining original classified
audio and video tapes that document raw test data do not need to include footers/headers showing the
applicable classification markings. However, the required classification markings must be placed on the
outside of the container and reel. All copies made from the original tapes must include headers/footers
that show the applicable classification markings. This will help ensure that valuable historical test data is
not inadvertently erased during the classification marking process. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.4.]

4.8. Removable Information Systems Storage Media. Use SF Form 706, Top Secret ADP Media Clas-
sification Label; SF 707, Secret ADP Media Classification Label; SF Form 708, Confidential ADP Media
Classification Label; SF 710, Unclassified Label, SF Form 711, ADP Data Descriptor Label, on remov-
able information systems storage media. These are available through the Air Force Publications Distribu-
tion System. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, Paragraphs 5-407 and 5-409a-b.]
   4.8.1. Many new removable information systems storage media are of size and shape that precludes
   application of the standard forms. Such media storing classified information must be permanently
   marked to display the highest classification of stored information.
   4.8.2. Designated Approving Authorities (DAA) have the authority to impose restrictions upon, and
   prohibit the use of, government owned removable information systems storage media for classified
   systems or networks. DAA approved restrictions will outline clearing, or destruction, procedures for
   unauthorized devices found in areas where classified processing takes place. Personally owned infor-
   mation systems storage media are prohibited in areas where classified is processed.
   4.8.3. The inherent risk of loss of small storage devices should be considered before using them for
   storing or transporting classified information. Procedures to reduce the potential for accidental loss
   must be included in local operating instructions. Include a review of these procedures in the
   semi-annual self-inspection and ISPRs.

4.9. Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.4.11.]
   4.9.1. See AFI 14-302, Control, Protection, and Dissemination of Sensitive Compartmented Informa-
   tion, for Air Force policy on intelligence information.
   4.9.2. The Special Security Office (SSO) is the focal point for release and dissemination of SCI. The
   Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 6/6, Security Controls on the Dissemination of
30                                                                AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007


     Intelligence Information and DCID 6/7, Intelligence Disclosure Policy provide criteria for release of
     intelligence to foreign officials.

4.10. Authorized for Release To (REL TO) Markings. [Reference DUSD(/)I Memo 27 Sep 2004, sub-
ject: Security Classification Marking Instructions.]
     4.10.1. “REL TO” identifies classified information that an originator has predetermined to be releas-
     able based on guidance provided by an Air Force specifically designated foreign disclosure official or
     has been released, through established foreign disclosure procedures and channels, to the foreign
     country(ies)/international organizations indicated.
     4.10.2. “REL TO” cannot be used with “Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals” (NOFORN) on page
     markings. When a document contains both NOFORN and REL TO portions, NOFORN takes prece-
     dence for the markings at the top and bottom of the page.
     4.10.2. (AFMC) Only those portions marked with “REL TO” can be released to a foreign entity with-
     out a formal foreign disclosure review.
     4.10.3. The full marking “REL TO USA//applicable country trigraph(s), international organization or
     coalition force tetragraph” shall be used after the classification and will appear at the top and bottom
     of the front cover, if there is one, the title page, if there is one, the first page and the outside of the back
     cover, if there is one. “REL TO” must include country code “USA” as the first country code listed.
     After the USA, country trigraphic code shall be listed in alphabetical order followed by international
     organization/coalition tetragraphic codes listed in alphabetical order.
     4.10.4. Country codes shall be separated by a comma and a space with the last country code separated
     by a space, a lower case “and” and a space,
                          EXAMPLE: TOP SECRET//REL TO USA, EGY and ISR.
     4.10.5. When portion marking, countries do not need to be listed unless they are different from the
     countries listed in the “REL TO” at the top and bottom of the page. Text that is releasable to all the
     countries listed at the top and bottom of the page shall be portion marked “REL.”
                                             EXAMPLE: (TS//REL)
     4.10.6. If the information is releasable to countries that are different than those listed in the overall
     “REL TO” marking, the portion marking has the same format, but with the specific countries/organi-
     zations listed alphabetically.
         EXAMPLE: The overall document marking is ‘SECRET//REL TO USA, NZL and NATO.”
         However, the portion marking may be: (S//REL TO USA, AUS, NZL and NATO) to indicate that
         information contained in this portion is also releasable to Australia.
     4.10.7. “NOFORN” is an authorized control marking for intelligence information IAW DCID 6/6,
     Security Controls on the Dissemination of Intelligence Information. Do not use the “NOFORN” dis-
     semination control marking on any document, including derivatively classified documents, without
     first verifying that the requirements of DCID 6/6 are met and that the marking is actually warranted.
     4.10.7. (AFMC) The lack of a Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals (NOFORN) marking is not
     authority for release to a foreign government, representatives thereof or international organizations.
     This applies to classified national security information and unclassified controlled information, but
AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007                                                                           31


   not to information approved for public release. Contact your servicing Foreign Disclosure Office
   (FDO) for applicable Delegation of Disclosure Authorization Letter (DDL) guidance.
   4.10.8. Countries represented with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 tri-
   graphic codes can be obtained from the ISPM or from INTELINK on the SIPRNET.

4.11. Classified Electronic Mail (E-Mail)
   4.11.1. All e-mails and documents accomplished on the SIPRNET, whether classified or unclassified,
   will contain the correct classification markings. Classified information may not be transmitted on the
   NIPRNET.
   4.11.2. The first marking in the Subject line of the e-mail will be the overall classification of the
   e-mail using these symbols: (S) for Secret, (C) for Confidential, and (U) for Unclassified. Following
   this will be the subject title, followed by the classification of the subject title.
   Example:
              Subject: (S) Unclassified E-Mail Sample (U)
   4.11.3. Do not send classified messages or mark messages as classified on an unclassified network.
   4.11.4. Place the appropriate classification of the e-mail in all uppercase letters as the first line of the
   e-mail message text.
   4.11.5. Begin the text of the message on the third line, leaving a blank line between the classification
   marking and the text.
   4.11.6. All paragraphs and subparagraphs will be marked with the appropriate portion marking. Use
   the abbreviated classification symbol at the beginning of all paragraphs and subparagraphs.
   4.11.7. Place the appropriate classification of the e-mail in all uppercase letters as the last line of the
   e-mail message text.
   4.11.8. All attachments (if any) will be marked appropriately with overall and portion markings. Indi-
   cate the classification of the attachment by placing the abbreviated classification symbol in parenthe-
   ses before the attachment icon.
   4.11.9. Place classification, declassification, and downgrading instructions after the signature block
   on the left margin.

                                             SAFEGUARDING

Section 5A—Control Measures

5.1. General. Air Force personnel are responsible, both personally and officially, for safeguarding clas-
sified information for which they have access. Collecting, obtaining, recording, or removing, for any
unauthorized use whatsoever, of any sensitive or classified information, is prohibited.
     5.1.1. Everyone should be aware that advancing technology provides constantly changing means to
     quickly collect and transport information. The introduction of electronic storage or transmission
     devices into areas that store, process, and/or generate classified information increases the risk to that
     information.
     5.1.2. Consult the servicing DAA for specific guidance concerning introduction into areas containing
     Information Systems (IS). [Reference DODD 8100.2, Use of Commercial Wireless Devices, Services,
     and Technologies in the Department of Defense (DOD) Global Information Grid (GIG).]

Section 5B—Access

5.2. Granting Access to Classified Information. Personnel who have authorized possession, knowl-
edge, or control of classified information grant individuals access to classified information when required
for mission essential needs and when the individual has the appropriate clearance eligibility according to
AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management; has signed an SF 312, Classified Information
Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA), and has a need to know the information. Those granting access to clas-
sified information must gain the originator’s approval before releasing the information outside the Exec-
utive Branch or as specified by the originator of the material. Also see paragraph 5.4.1.1. of this AFI.
[References DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2., and EO 12958, as amended, Section 4.1(c.)]
     5.2.1. The Secretary of Defense directed all military members and civilian employees with Top
     Secret eligibility or access to a specially controlled access category or compartmented information to
     make a one time verbal attestation to the first paragraph of the SF 312. The verbal attestation must be
     witnessed by at least one individual in addition to the official who presides over the attestation and
     manages the process [Reference DOD 5200.1-PH-1.] The procedures for personal attestation include:
        5.2.1.1. The statement, "Attestation completed on (date)," is placed in the bottom of the Organi-
        zation block in Item 11 of the SF 312.
        5.2.1.2. The individual making the verbal attestation will complete Item 11 of the SF 312. The
        witness will sign in the Witness block. The presiding official will sign in the Acceptance block.
        5.2.1.3. Record the date of attestation in JPAS.
        5.2.1.4. (Added-AFMC) Forward signed attestations to the same organizations that retain the SF
        312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA).
     5.2.2. Confirm an individual’s access level. The holder of the information must confirm valid
     need-to-know and must verify the level of access authorization. Those granting access to classified
     information will confirm a person's access level by:
AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007                                                                        33


       5.2.2.1. Checking the person's access level, clearance eligibility, and date the person signed the
       SF 312 and completed Non-SCI Indoctrination, in JPAS; or
       5.2.2.2. Confirming it through the employee's security manager, supervisor, or commander or
       equivalent, or staff agency chief; or
       5.2.2.3. Receiving a visit request from a non-DOD visitor's security manager or supervisor. See
       paragraph 5.5. for further guidance.

5.3. Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA). Signing the NdA is a prerequisite for obtaining access (see para-
graph 5.2.). Unit commanders or equivalents and staff agency chiefs are responsible for ensuring their
employees have signed one by checking JPAS or the employee’s personnel records. If they have not
signed one, those responsible use DOD 5200.1-PH-1, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement
(Standard Form 312) Briefing Pamphlet, to brief people on the purpose. Record the NdA on-line through
JPAS prior to sending the signed form for retention.
NOTE: When the employee’s access level is passed to another office or activity, that office or activity
can assume the employee has signed one.
5.3. (AFMC) Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA). Provide a copy of the completed SF 312 to the individ-
ual upon request. Once you enter the data into JPAS, there is no need to maintain a local file copy of the
SF 312.
   5.3.1. Retention. Security managers mail the NdA to the following organizations who will retain the
   NdAs for 50 years.
       5.3.1.1. For active military members, to HQ AFPC/DPFFCMI, 550 C St., W, Suite 21, Randolph

        5.3.1.5. For persons outside the Executive Branch who receive access according to paragraph
        5.4., the servicing ISPM to the activity granting access will file the NdA.
        5.3.1.5. (AFMC) ISPMs maintain the SF 312 IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule.
     5.3.2. Refusal To Sign. When a person refuses to sign an NdA, the commander or equivalent, or staff
     agency chief:
        5.3.2.1. Initiates security incident report, in JPAS, that the person refused to sign the NdA.

        5.3.2.3. Initiate actions to establish a Security Information File (SIF) according to AFI 31-501.

5.4. Access by Persons Outside the Executive Branch.
     5.4.1. Policy. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders and HAF 2-digits or their designees authorize indi-
     viduals outside the executive branch to access Air Force classified material as follows unless other-
     wise provided in DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph C6.2.2.
        5.4.1.1. Authorizing Officials (those cited in paragraph 5.4.1. above) may grant access once they
        have:
            5.4.1.1.1. Gained release approval from the originator or owner of the information. Normally,
            this is the same official identified in paragraph 5.4.1.1.2.2. below.
            5.4.1.1.2. Determined the individual has a current favorable personnel security investigation
            as defined by AFI 31-501 and a check of JPAS and a local files check (LFC) shows there is no
            unfavorable information since the previous clearance. A LFC must be processed according to
            AFI 31-501. EXCEPTION: In cases where there is no current personnel security investigation
            as defined in AFI 31-501, MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders and HAF 2-digits may request
            a National Agency Check (NAC) and grant access up to the Secret level before the NAC is
            complete when there is a favorable LFC and the Air Force Central Adjudication Facility
            (AFCAF) confirms there is no unfavorable information on the individual in JPAS. When
            applying this exception, follow the procedures outlined in AFI 31-501, paragraph 3.11. for
            interim security clearance eligibility.
                5.4.1.1.2.1. Authority to grant access to persons outside the Executive Branch without a
                previous clearance may not be delegated below the listed positions in paragraph 5.4.1.1.2.
                5.4.1.1.2.2. Before material is released to persons outside the Executive Branch without a
                previous clearance, the OCA must be contacted and approve the access.
            5.4.1.1.3. Determined granting access will benefit the government.
        5.4.1.2. Requests for access must include:
            5.4.1.2.1. The person’s name, SSAN, date and place of birth, and citizenship.
            5.4.1.2.2. Place of employment.

         request.
     5.4.1.3. The authorizing official will coordinate the processing of the NAC request with the near-
     est Air Force authorized requester of investigations.
     5.4.1.4. Individuals with approval must sign an NdA before accessing information. Upon comple-
     tion of access, individuals must sign an AF Form 2587, Security Termination Statement.
     5.4.1.4. (AFMC) ISPM will maintain the AF FORM 2587, Security Termination Statement,
     within the approval package file.
  5.4.2. Congress. See AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations with Congress, for guidance when granting
  classified access to members of Congress, its committees, members, and staff representatives. [Refer-
  ence DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.2.1]
  5.4.3. Government Printing Office (GPO). The GPO processes and confirms their personnel’s access.
  [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.2.2]
  5.4.4. Representatives of the Government Accountability Office (GAO). See AFI 65-401, Relations
  with the General Accounting Office, for access requirements. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.2.3.]
  5.4.5. Historical Researchers. AFHRA OL-A/HOR is the authority for granting access to historical
  researchers on behalf of the Air Force Historian (HQ USAF/HO). [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
  C6.2.2.4.]
     5.4.5.1. General. Requests for classified access by historical researchers will be processed only in
     exceptional cases wherein extraordinary justification exists. Access will be granted to the
     researcher only if the records cannot be obtained through available declassification processes (i.e.,
     the FOIA and MDR processes) and when the access clearly supports the interests of national secu-
     rity.
     5.4.5.2. Providing Access.
         5.4.5.2.1. The researcher must apply to AFHRA OL-A/HOR in writing for the access. The
         application will fully describe the project including the sources of documentation that the
         researcher wants to access.
         5.4.5.2.2. If AFHRA OL-A/HOR accepts the request for access, they will provide the
         researcher with written authorization to go to the nearest Air Force installation security forces
         office to complete a personnel security questionnaire for a NAC according to AFI 31-501.
         5.4.5.2.3. If the results of the NAC are favorable and AFHRA OL-A/HOR approves access,
         the researcher must sign a SF 312 and an agreement to submit any notes and manuscript(s) for
         security and policy review(AFI 35-101). This process is to ensure the documents do not con-
         tain any classified information and, if so, determine if they can be declassified. Send the SF
         312 to AFHRA OL-A/HOR for retention. Classified information will not be removed from
         government facilities.
         5.4.5.2.4. Other Terms.
36                                                             AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007


                5.4.5.2.4.1. The access agreement is valid for two years. One two-year renewal is possi-
                ble. A renewal will not be considered if the project appears to be inactive in the months
                before the end of the original agreement.
                5.4.5.2.4.2. Access will be limited to those records 25 or more years of age.
                5.4.5.2.4.3. Access based on a NAC is valid for Secret and Confidential information but
                does not meet the requirement for access to RD or SAP information. Access to Top Secret
                or SCI information is not authorized.
                5.4.5.2.4.4. Access will be allowed only to Air Force records at AFHSO, AFHRA, and the
                National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
                5.4.5.2.4.5. Access to Air Force records still in the custody of the originating offices in the
                Washington National Capital Region must be approved in writing by the originating
                offices or their successors. It is the responsibility of the researcher to secure this approval.
     5.4.6. Former Presidential Appointees. Persons who previously occupied policy-making positions to
     which the President appointed them may not remove classified information upon departure from
     office. All such material must remain under the security control of the U.S. Government. Such persons
     may be authorized access to classified information they originated, received, reviewed, signed, or that
     was addressed to them while serving in their official capacity, provided the applicable Air Force
     OCA: [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.2.5.]
        5.4.6.1. Makes a written determination that such access is clearly consistent with the interests of
        national security;
        5.4.6.2. Uses the same access determination procedures outlined in paragraph 5.4. of this AFI;
        5.4.6.3. Limits the access to specific categories of information over which the Air Force OCA has
        classification jurisdiction;
        5.4.6.4. Maintains custody of the information or authorizes access to documents in the custody of
        the NARA; and,
        5.4.6.5. Obtains the individual’s agreement to safeguard the information and to submit any notes
        and manuscript for a security review (AFI 35-101, Chapter 15) to ensure that the documents do
        not contain classified information or to determine if any classified information should be declassi-
        fied.
     5.4.7. Judicial Proceedings. See AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation, for more information regarding the
     release of classified information in litigation.
     5.4.8. Other Situations. Follow the guidance in paragraph 5.4.1.1. above. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
     C6.2.2.7.]
     5.4.9. Foreign Nationals, Foreign Governments, and International Organizations. Owners of classi-
     fied information disclose it to foreign nationals, foreign governments, and international organizations
     only when they receive authorization from SAF/IAPD, 1080 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC
     20330-1080. (See AFI 16-201, Foreign Disclosure of Classified and Unclassified Military Informa-
     tion to Foreign Governments and International Organizations, for more specific guidance.) See
     Attachment 4 for guidance on transmitting classified information to foreign governments.
     5.4.9. (AFMC) Coordinate SAF/IAPD approval through your servicing FDO.
AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007                                                                        37


   5.4.10. Retired Flag or General Officers or Civilian Equivalent. See AFI 31-501. These individuals
   need not sign a NdA if the original one is already filed in their retired file or JPAS. (see paragraph
   5.3.1.3.).

5.5. Access by Visitors. JPAS is the primary source for confirming access eligibility for DOD and DOD
contractor personnel. Visit authorization letters will not be used to pass security clearance information
unless JPAS is not available. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.3.]
5.5. (AFMC) Access by Visitors. The visit hosts must confirm each visitor's clearance and need to know.
Incorporate visitor control procedures in unit security operating instructions. These must, as a minimum,
define processes to control visitors during the visit.
   5.5.1. Outgoing Visit Requests for Air Force Employees. When an Air Force employee requires
   access to classified information at:
       5.5.1.1. A non-DOD contractor activity, the supervisor or security manager contacts the office to
       be visited to determine the desired clearance verification.
       5.5.1.2. A DoE activity, the supervisor or security manager prepares and processes DoE Form
       5631.20, according to DODD 5210.2, Access to and Dissemination of Restricted Data. Also see
       paragraph 1.5.1. of this AFI.
   5.5.2. Incoming Visit Requests. Air Force activity visit hosts serve as the approval authority for visits
   to their activities. Use JPAS to confirm security clearances of DOD personnel, including DOD con-
   tractors. Installation or activity commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs receiving a visit
   request:
       5.5.2.1. From non-DOD contractors, see DOD 5220.22-M, Chapter 6.
       5.5.2.2. From foreign nationals or U.S. citizens representing a foreign government, process the
       visit request according to AFI 16-201.

5.6. Preventing Public Release of Classified Information. See AFI 35-101, Chapter 15, for guidance
on security reviews to prevent people from publishing classified information in personal or commercial
articles, presentations, theses, books or other products written for general publication or distribution.

5.7. Access to Information Originating in a Non-DOD Department or Agency. Holders allow access
under the rules of the originating agency.

5.8. Administrative Controls.
   5.8.1. Top Secret. The security of Top Secret material is paramount. Strict compliance with Top
   Secret control procedures take precedence over administrative convenience. These procedures ensure
   stringent need to know rules and security safeguards are applied to our most critical and sensitive
   information. The Air Force accounts for Top Secret material and disposes of such administrative
   records according to WebRims Records Disposition Schedule.
       5.8.1.1. Establishing a Top Secret Control Account (TSCA). Unit commanders or equivalents,
       and staff agency chiefs who routinely originate, store, receive, or dispatch Top Secret material
       establish a Top Secret account and designate a Top Secret Control Officer (TSCO), with one or
       more alternates, to maintain it. The unit commander or staff agency chief will notify the installa-
38                                                            AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007


       tion ISPM of the establishment of TSCAs and the names of thE TSCO. The TSCO uses AF Form
       143, Top Secret Register Page, to account for each document (to include page changes and
       inserts that have not yet been incorporated into the basic document) and each piece of material or
       equipment to include IS media. NOTE: For IS information systems or microfiche media, TSCOs
       must either describe each Top Secret document stored on the media on the AF Form 143 or attach
       a list of the documents to it. This will facilitate a damage assessment if the media are lost or stolen.
       EXCEPTIONS:
       5.8.1.1. (AFMC) All Top Secret Control Officers (TSCOs) and alternates will attend training
       provided by the servicing ISPM.
          5.8.1.1.1. Top Secret Messages. TSCOs do not use AF Form 143 for Top Secret messages
          kept in telecommunications facilities on a transitory basis for less than 30 days. Instead, use
          message delivery registers or other similar records of accountability.
          5.8.1.1.2. Defense Courier Service (DCS) Receipts. TSCOs don’t use AF Forms 143 as a
          receipt for information received from or delivered to the DCS. DCS receipts suffice for
          accountability purposes in these cases. Retain as prescribed by WebRims Records Disposition
          Schedule.
NOTE: TSCOs may automate their accounts as long as all of the required information is included in the
information system.
       5.8.1.2. Top Secret Disclosure Records.
          5.8.1.2.1. The TSCO uses AF Form 144, Top Secret Access Record and Cover Sheet, as the
          disclosure record and keeps it attached to the applicable Top Secret material. Each person that
          accesses the attached Top Secret information signs the form prior to initial access.
          5.8.1.2.2. People assigned to an office that processes large volumes (i.e., several hundred doc-
          uments) of Top Secret material need not record who accesses the material. NOTE: This
          applies only when these offices limit entry to assigned and appropriately cleared personnel
          identified on an access roster.
       5.8.1.3. Top Secret Inventories. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs:
          5.8.1.3.1. Designate officials to conduct annual inventories for all Top Secret material in the
          account and to conduct inventories whenever there is a change in TSCOs. These officials must
          be someone other than the TSCO or alternate TSCOs of the TSCA being inventoried. The pur-
          pose of the inventory is to ensure all of the Top Secret material is accounted for, discrepancies
          resolved, and its status is correctly reflected on the corresponding AF Form 143.
          5.8.1.3.2. Ensure necessary actions are taken to correct deficiencies identified in the inventory
          report.
          5.8.1.3.3. Ensure the inventory report and a record of corrective actions taken are maintained
          with the account.
          5.8.1.3.4. May authorize the annual inventory of Top Secret documents and material in repos-
          itories, libraries, or activities storing large volumes of Top Secret documents and material be
          limited to a random sampling using the percentage scale indicated below. If account discrep-
          ancies are discovered the commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief must determine if the
          random sample percentage method will suffice or if a higher percentage inventory will be
AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007                                                                      39


          accomplished. If the higher percentage inventory is chosen, the inventory percentage will
          increase by no less than 20 percent.
              5.8.1.3.4.1. One hundred percent, if there are fewer than 300 Top Secret documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.2. No less than 90 percent if the holdings range from 301 to 400 Top Secret doc-
              uments.
              5.8.1.3.4.3. No less than 80 percent if the holdings range from 401 to 500 Top Secret doc-
              uments.
              5.8.1.3.4.4. No less than 70 percent if the holdings range from 501 to 600 Top Secret doc-
              uments.
              5.8.1.3.4.5. No less than 60 percent if the holdings range from 601 to 800 Top Secret doc-
              uments.
              5.8.1.3.4.6. No less than 50 percent if the holdings range from 801 to 1,000 Top Secret
              documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.7. No less than 40 percent if the holdings range from 1,001 to 1,300 Top Secret
              documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.8. No less than 30 percent if the holdings range from 1,301 to 1,800 Top Secret
              documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.9. No less than 20 percent if the holdings range from 1,801 to 2,800 Top Secret
              documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.10. No less than 10 percent if the holdings exceed 2,800 Top Secret documents.
      5.8.1.4. Special Access Programs will follow the inventory and accountability requirements pre-
      scribed by the AFSAPCO.
      5.8.1.5. Top Secret Receipts. TSCOs use AF Form 143 as a receipt when transferring Top Secret
      material from one TSCO to another on the same installation.
      5.8.1.6. Top Secret Facsimiles. Top Secret facsimiles will be processed as another copy of the
      main Top Secret document in the TSCA. All the same rules apply except the register page and dis-
      closure record will be faxed along with the document to the addressee. The addressee will sign and
      return them immediately to the sender for inclusion in the TSCA.
   5.8.2. Secret. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs set up procedures for internal
   control of Secret material. When entering Secret material into a mail distribution system, a receipt is
   required. Personnel may use AF Form 310, as a receipt.
   5.8.3. Confidential. Individuals need not use a receipt for Confidential material unless asked to do so
   by the originating activity.
   5.8.4. Foreign Government and NATO Information. See DOD 5200.1-R, C6.6., for receipting
   requirements.
   5.8.5. Retention of Receipts. Retain receipt and other accountability records IAW WebRims Records
   Disposition Schedule.

5.9. Care During Working Hours.
     5.9.1. Personnel removing classified material from storage must:
        5.9.1.1. For Top Secret material use AF Form 144, instead of SF Form 703, Top Secret Cover
        Sheet (see paragraph 5.8.1.2.1.) except as specified in paragraph 5.8.1.2.2. above. [Reference
        DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.2.1.]
        5.9.1.2. For Secret or Confidential material use SF Form 704, Secret Cover Sheet, or SF Form
        705, Confidential Cover Sheet, as appropriate. These forms are available through the Air Force
        Publications Distribution system.
        5.9.1.3. Use the SF Form 702, to record openings and closings for all General Services Adminis-
        tration (GSA)-approved security containers, vaults, and approved secure storage rooms.
     5.9.2. The nature of the classified material typically stored within a secure room or vault may pre-
     clude the use of cover sheets. Use cover sheets when feasible.

5.10. End-of-Day Security Checks. Each unit and staff agency that processes, stores, or generates clas-
sified information will conduct an end-of-day security check to ensure classified material is stored appro-
priately. Personnel conducting these checks will do so at the close of each working day and record them
on the SF Form 701, when security containers are present, even if the container was not opened that day.
The “Checked By” column of the SF 702 does not require end-of-day documentation. Activities that are
continuously staffed will establish local procedures to provide for daily security checks. Document those
daily security checks on the SF 701. Note: Additional security and safety checks may be added in the
blanks on the SF 701. All security containers will be listed on the SF 701 for end-of-day checks.
5.10. (AFMC) End-of-Day Security Checks. Organizations with extensive classified holdings may use
locally-generated continuation sheets in addition to the SF 701, Activity Security Checklist, to list security
containers. Use the SF 702, Security Container Check Sheet, "Checked By" column to verify the security
status of containers, vaults and secure storage rooms during the end-of-day security check and annotate it
whether or not they were opened during the day.

5.11. Residential Storage Arrangements.
     5.11.1. SAF/OS and SAF/AA authorize the removal of Top Secret information from designated
     working areas. Requesters send requests through command ISPM channels to HQ USAF/XOS-FI
     [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.7.1.]
     5.11.1. (AFMC) All AFMC general officers may take Secret and Confidential collateral classified
     national security information to their on-base residence. The residence must be located within an
     access controlled perimeter and have an approved GSA security container. The combination to the
     residence container must be stored in an approved GSA container within the general officer’s work
     center to permit retrieval of the container’s contents in the event of an emergency. This authorization
     does not apply to caveat information such as CNWDI, NATO, Restricted Data/Formerly Restricted
     Data (RD/FRD) etc. In all other cases, submit requests through the servicing ISPM to HQ AFMC/
     A7S. The servicing ISPM reviews the request and recommends approval/disapproval. AFMC/CC has
     delegated final approval authority for these requests to HQ AFMC/A7S.
AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007                                                                         41


   5.11.2. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders, or their ISPMs approve requests for removing Secret and
   Confidential material from designated work areas during non-duty hours [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
   C63.7.2.]
   5.11.3. Contingency Plans. The written procedures will be developed as required by DOD 5200.1-R,
   C6.3.7.3. to include arrangements for notifying the responsible activity to pick up the classified con-
   tainer and material in the event something happens to the user [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.4.]

5.12. In-Transit Storage. Installation commanders:
   5.12.1. Provide an overnight repository for classified material. A locally developed awareness pro-
   gram ensures operations dispatch, passenger services, base entry controllers, and billeting staff are
   aware of the availability.
   5.12.1. (AFMC) Cargo security cages or rooms used for temporary storage of classified material
   must have an intrusion detection alarm operating when attendants are not present. Servicing ISPMs
   review and approve these areas prior to their establishment.
   5.12.2. Authorize the storage of Secret and Confidential material on the flightline during in-process-
   ing for deployment when the material is stored in a standard GSA-approved security container and the
   in-transit area is controlled and located on an Air Force installation.

5.13. Classified Meetings and Conferences [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.8.]
   5.13.1. Classified information at meetings, conferences, symposia, portions or sessions of meetings,
   conferences, etc., during which classified information is to be disseminated shall be limited to appro-
   priately cleared U.S. Government or U.S. Government contractor locations. Auditoriums, assembly
   halls, or gymnasiums that are primarily for public gatherings at cleared contractor facilities will not be
   used for a classified meeting at which Top Secret or Secret information would be disclosed, even
   though it is located on a portion of the contractor’s cleared facility [DOD 5220.22-R, Para C1.4.5.1].
   5.13.2. Facility Approval Authority. Installation commanders or their designees assess the need to
   establish and approve secure conference and classified training facilities. Normally, secure conference
   or classified training facilities are only established at locations where frequent classified meetings or
   forums occur. If such a facility does not openly store classified information, secure construction
   requirements are not mandated. However, if installation commanders or their designees determine the
   local threat and security environment dictates more stringent construction requirements, they can use
   DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 7 as a guide for constructing the facility.
   5.13.2. (AFMC) In addition to DoD 5200.1-R, Appendix 7, use Director of Central Intelligence
   Directive (DCID) 6/9, Annex E, Acoustical Control and Sound Masking Techniques, for reference
   when considering construction of a secure conference room.
       5.13.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Installation ISPMs will review all facilities and associated procedures
       involving collateral classified information to ensure all requirements are met and provide a formal
       concurrence/non-concurrence.
       5.13.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Activities hosting classified meetings or forums will coordinate their
       security procedures with the servicing ISPM. As a minimum, procedures should contain the meet-
       ing title, its location, purpose, classification level (if permitted), identity of the responsible SM
       and a statement of who (organization or title) approved the meeting. Also, the plan must address
42                                                              AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007


        clearance verification procedures prior to attendee arrival, an assessment of security controls
        required during the meeting (e.g. perimeter guards), access controls at the meeting entry point,
        policy on introducing and utilization of electronic or photographic devices in the meeting room,
        storage of classified materials (exhibits/documents) before, during and after the meeting, policy/
        procedures for note-taking during classified portions of the meeting and communications/destruc-
        tion/transmission procedures for those requiring these services during or after the meeting. The
        plan is not limited to these areas alone; additional requirements are determined locally. The plan is
        not necessary for meetings held in a secure conference facility approved by the ISPM or an equiv-
        alent agency as described in paragraph 1.3.4. of this supplement, nor does it apply to routine or
        ad-hoc discussions between individuals.
        5.13.2.3. (Added-AFMC) The servicing ISPM will ensure secure conference rooms meet secu-
        rity requirements by coordinating on all new construction plans and procedures. The ISPM will
        conduct a physical security survey upon completion of construction prior to use. All issues regard-
        ing EMSEC or TSCM and threat assessment requirements for these rooms are the responsibility of
        base Information Assurance activities and AFOSI respectively.
        5.13.2.4. (Added-AFMC) ISPMs shall maintain a listing of all approved secure conference
        rooms for customers they service.
     5.13.3. Foreign Participation. Hosting officials refer to AFI 16-201, Foreign Disclosure of Classified
     and Unclassified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International Organizations, for
     specific guidance.
     5.13.3. (AFMC) Foreign participation in classified or unclassified meetings and conferences will
     take place only after servicing FDO approval.
     5.13.4. Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) Surveys. Commanders or equivalents, and
     staff agency chiefs or their designees determine to do TSCM surveys based on mission sensitivity and
     threat. See AFI 71-101, Volume 3, The Air Force Technical Surveillance Countermeasures Program
     for additional guidance.

5.14. Protecting Classified Material on Aircraft. Classified material and components are routinely
carried on USAF aircraft. The purpose of this paragraph is to provide minimum standards for the protec-
tion of classified material and components while minimizing the impact on aircrew operations. The fol-
lowing minimum standards are established to provide cost effective security of classified material and
components and to ensure detection of unauthorized access.
     5.14.1. Aircraft commanders (owners/users) are responsible for the protection of classified material
     and components aboard their aircraft whether on a DOD facility, at a civilian airfield, or when stop-
     ping in foreign countries IAW DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph C6.3.9. Aircraft commanders should con-
     sult with the local ISPM or senior security forces representative for assistance in complying with these
     requirements.

     removable classified in an approved security container in an authorized U.S. facility. Classified
     components, attached to the aircraft, do not have to be removed.
  5.14.3. To provide security-in-depth for classified components and material on PL 4 or non-PL air-
  craft, park the aircraft in a controlled area. PL 4 and non-PL aircraft should not be parked in a
  restricted area due to use of force limitations.
     5.14.3.1. Lock the aircraft using a GSA-approved changeable combination padlock (Federal
     Specification FF-P-110) series available from GSA under NSN 5340-00-285-6523 to secure the
     crew entry door, and
     5.14.3.2. Secure removable classified material IAW paragraph 5.14.2.2. or 5.14.2.3.
  5.14.4. At non-U.S. controlled locations, host nation restricted/controlled areas may be used only if
  all material and components aboard the aircraft have been approved for release to the host nation by a
  cognizant foreign disclosure authority. Material should be secured IAW paragraph 5.14.2. for
  restricted areas and paragraph 5.14.3. for controlled areas.

        5.14.5.4. If none of the above criteria can be met, U.S. cleared personnel must provide continuous
        surveillance. Foreign national personnel cleared by their government may be used if all material
        and components aboard the aircraft have been approved for release to the host nation by a cogni-
        zant foreign disclosure authority.
     5.14.6. MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs determine specific risk management security standards for weather
     diverts and in-flight emergencies. Review AFKAG-1N if the classified information is COMSEC
     material.
     5.14.7. If evidence exists of unauthorized entry, initiate a security investigation IAW Chapter 9 of
     this AFI.

5.15. Information Processing Equipment.
     5.15.1. Machines with Copying Capability. For copiers and facsimile machines or any machines with
     copying capability (e.g., microfiche machines), personnel consult their unit information manager
     (3A0X1) to determine if the machines are authorized for copying classified, and if so, determine if
     they retain any latent images when copying classified, and how to clear them when they do. Net-
     worked copiers present unique security hazards that require DAA approval. Also see paragraph 5.24.
     for reproduction authority [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.10.]
     5.15.2. Protect information system equipment or removable hard disk drive and the information sys-
     tem media at the highest security classification processed by the system [Reference Air Force Special
     Security Instruction (AFSSI) 5020, paragraph 2.2.2.]

     Dissemination of Sensitive Compartmented Information (supersedes USAFINTEL 201-1.)
     5.16.5. Retention of Classified Records. Personnel follow the disposition guidance in WebRims
     Records Disposition Schedule.

5.17. Standards for Storage Equipment. GSA-approved security containers must have a label stating
“General Services Administration Approved Security Container” affixed to the front of the container usu-
ally on the control or top drawer.
AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007                                                                       45


   5.17.1. If the label is missing or if the container’s integrity is in question, the container shall be
   inspected by a GSA certified inspector.
   5.17.2. Organizations without organic GSA certified inspectors must confirm that contractor inspec-
   tors are GSA certified prior to allowing them to work on GSA-approved containers.
   5.17.3. If the container is found to meet specifications, a new label shall be attached. Information on
   obtaining inspections and recertification of containers can be found in FED-STD-809 on the DOD
   Lock Program web page (http://locks.nfesc.navy.mil/) or by calling GSA at (703) 305-7342 or the
   DOD Lock Program at (800) 290-7607.
   5.17.4. Inspecting personnel must note their findings and the source of confirmation on an AFTO
   Form 36, (available on the AFEPL), and retain that record in the container [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
   C6.4.]

5.18. Storage of Classified Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.]
   5.18.1. Replacement of Combination Locks. Commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs
   must ensure all combination locks on GSA-approved security containers and doors are replaced with
   those meeting Federal Specification FF-L-2740 starting with those storing the most sensitive informa-
   tion according to the priority matrix in DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 7.
   5.18.2. Due to operational necessity or the size and nature of some classified materials, it may be nec-
   essary to construct secure rooms for storage because GSA-approved containers or vaults are unsuit-
   able or impractical. Secure rooms must be approved by the ISPM and be constructed IAW DOD
   5200.1-R Appendix 7. Access to secure rooms must be controlled to preclude unauthorized access.
   Access shall be limited to authorized persons who have an appropriate security clearance and a
   need-to-know for the classified material/information within the area. Persons without the appropriate
   level of clearance and/or need to know shall be escorted at all times by an authorized person where
   inadvertent or unauthorized exposure to classified information cannot otherwise be effectively pre-
   vented. The nature of the classified material typically stored within a secure room or vault may pre-
   clude the use of cover sheets.
      5.18.2.1. (Added-AFMC) The ISPM confirms that construction of the secure room is IAW DoD
      5200.1-R, Appendix 7, with assistance from the base civil engineer if necessary. Before seeking
      approval for these areas, the using commander, director or equivalent will submit to the servicing
      ISPM a written plan for utilization of the secure room, to include security controls employed to
      provide adequate safeguarding protection and positive entry control to the storage area. The ISPM
      reviews this plan for accuracy and thoroughness and recommends concurrence/non-concurrence.
      5.18.2.2. (Added-AFMC) ISPMs approve secure rooms to meet a specific operational require-
      ment and only classified national security information relative to that specific requirement shall be
      stored in the approved room. Users of secure rooms must ensure their operational procedures com-
      ply with the spirit and intent of this purpose and avoid expedient approaches which reduce protec-
      tive measures or increase the possibility of compromising classified national security information.
      5.18.2.3. (Added-AFMC) All structures designated as secure rooms for the open storage of
      SECRET materiel after 1 October 1995 and not continuously occupied or guarded will be
      alarmed. Secure rooms approved prior to 1 October 1995 are exempt from this requirement. How-
      ever, programming to fund alarms for these rooms must be included in any modification or reha-
      bilitation plans. This "grandfathering" provision only applies for the duration of the current
46                                                           AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007


        program, project or activity that necessitated establishment of the secure room. It does not apply to
        follow-on unrelated programs, projects or activities. Install and operate alarm systems IAW DoD
        5200.1-R, Appendix 7, and AFI 31-101, Air Force Installation Security Program. Minimum sys-
        tem requirements are described in DoD 5200.1-R, Appendix 7, Section AP7.2.
        5.18.2.4. (Added-AFMC) Servicing ISPMs maintain records of all secure rooms, to include the
        specific location of the room, certification of compliance with construction requirements and
        approval for the current occupant to operate the secure room.

5.19. Use of Key-Operated Locks [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.3.6.1.]
     5.19.1. The authority to determine the appropriateness of using key-operated locks for storage areas
     containing bulky Secret and Confidential material is delegated to the unit commanders or equivalents,
     and staff agency chiefs having this storage requirement. When key-operated locks are used, the autho-
     rizing official will designate lock and key custodians.
        5.19.1.1. (Added-AFMC) When not attended or used, keys providing access to SECRET or
        CONFIDENTIAL information shall be secured in a GSA approved security container or in a
        non-GSA approved container constructed of at least 20-gauge steel or material of equivalent
        strength and having a built-in GSA-approved combination lock or high security key operated pad-
        lock.
        5.19.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Both keys and locks will be audited monthly. Document the audit
        using AF Form 2427, Lock and Key Control Register.
     5.19.2. Lock and key custodians use AF Form 2427, (available on the AFEPL) to identify and keep
     track of keys.

     ence DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.1.]
     5.21.2. Use SF Form 700, Security Container Information (available through the Air Force Publi-
     cations Distribution system), for each vault or secure room door and security container, to record the
     location of the door or container, and the names, home addresses, and home telephone numbers of the
     individuals who are to be contacted if the door or container is found open and unattended. Applying
     classification marking to SF 700, Part 1, is not required when separated from Part 2 and 2a.
        5.21.2.1. Affix the form to the vault or secure door or to the inside of the locking drawer of the
        security container. Post SF Form 700 to each individual locking drawer of security container with
        more than one locking drawer, if they have different access requirements.

   5.27.1. Personnel follow the disposition guidance in WebRims Records Disposition Schedule.
   5.27.2. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs will designate a “clean-out day”
   once a year to ensure personnel are not retaining classified material longer than necessary [Reference
   DOD 5200.1-R, C6.7.2.1.]
   5.27.2. (AFMC) The second Friday of March is the annual clean-out day for AFMC Centers and
   Staff Agencies. Another date may be chosen if there are compelling local requirements.

5.28. Disposition and Destruction of Classified Material [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.7.2.]
   5.28.1. Shredders purchased from an approved product list that produces a crosscut shred size of ½”
   x 1/32” or smaller, may continue to be used for destruction of collateral information until 1 October
   2008. Employ compensatory measures such as mixing unclassified material with the shredding and
   stirring of the shredded material. Replacement shredders for destruction of classified information
   must be purchased from the National Security Agency (NSA)-approved Equipment Product List.
   Obtain information on approved destruction devices from the NSA Information Assurance web site
   (http://www.nsa.gov/ia/government/mdg.cfm). Please note that this list is FOUO and is updated
   quarterly on the restricted NSA site.
   5.28.2. Records of Destruction Process.
       5.28.2.1. Top Secret. TSCOs will ensure:
          5.28.2.1.1. Two people with Top Secret access are involved in the destruction process;
          5.28.2.1.2. Destruction is recorded on one of these forms: AF Form 143; AF Form 310; or, AF
          Form 1565, and,
          5.28.2.1.3. The destruction record is attached to the AF Form 143 (used to account for the
          document) when the destruction is not recorded on the AF Form 143 itself.
       5.28.2.2. Secret and Confidential. A record of destruction is not required. A cleared person must
       perform the destruction.
       5.28.2.3. FGI. See DOD 5200.1-R, C6.6, for destruction of FGI.

Section 6A—Methods of Transmission or Transportation

6.1. General Policy.
     6.1.1. Hand carrying Classified Material During Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel. Hand carrying clas-
     sified material during TDY poses a risk and should be done as a last resort in critical situations. When-
     ever possible, personnel will use standard secure methods for relaying the data, e.g., mail through
     secure channels or through approved secure electronic means. Authorizing officials must assess the
     risk before authorizing the hand carrying of classified material. Some factors to consider during the
     risk assessment process are:
        6.1.1.1. The environment in which the material will be handcarried. Consider the chances of the
        material being confiscated by unauthorized personnel. The servicing AFOSI office should be able
        to assist in determining the risks associated with the environment.
        6.1.1.2. The sensitivity of the information. Consider the damage it could cause the United States
        if the information was compromised.
        6.1.1.3. The availability of authorized facilities for storing the classified during overnight lay-
        overs, at the TDY location, etc. Consider storing the material at a U.S. military installation or
        other government facility.
     6.1.2. Laptop Computers are High Risk. Because of their commercial value, laptop computers are an
     especially high risk when used to transport classified information. When using laptops to handcarry
     classified information, couriers must ensure both laptop and disks are prepared according to paragraph
     6.6.3. In addition, as required for all classified material, couriers must take special care to ensure lap-
     tops and disks are kept under constant surveillance or in secure facilities/containers at all times.
     6.1.3. Air Force Office of Primary Responsibility for Transmission and Transportation Policy. HQ
     USAF/XOS-FI establishes Air Force policy and procedures for transmission and transportation of
     classified information and material [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.1.]
     6.1.4. Transmitting Classified Material by Pneumatic Tube Systems. Installation commanders
     approve the use of pneumatic tube systems and ensure that the equipment and procedures provide ade-
     quate security [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.1.]
     6.1.5. Electronic Transmission and Physical Transportation of COMSEC Material. Personnel may
     acquire information on electronic transmission and physical transportation of COMSEC information
     and material from their supporting COMSEC manager. (Reference AFI 33-201, AFI 33-211, AFI
     33-275, and DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.2.]
     6.1.6. Releasing Other Agency Information Outside of the DoD. Personnel go direct to owners of
     other agency information to request permission to release the information outside the DoD [Reference
     DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.4.]

   6.3.2. The Air Force authorizes the use of the current holder of the GSA contract for overnight deliv-
   ery of Secret information in urgent cases and when the delivery is between DOD Components and
   their cleared contractor facilities within the United States and its Territories. This applies to locations
   in Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam when overnight delivery is possible. USD/I has already ensured the con-
   ditions cited in DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph C7.1.3.3., have been met [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
   C7.1.3.3.]
      6.3.2.1. The Defense Security Service maintains a list of authorized GSA contract overnight
      delivery services at http://www.dss.mil/isec/approved_overnight.htm.
      6.3.2.2. The carriers identified on the DSS list may be used for urgent overnight delivery of Secret
      and Confidential material within the continental United States (CONUS) when overnight delivery
      cannot reasonably be accomplished by the U.S. Postal Service. However, classified COMSEC
      information may not be transmitted overnight. Controlled Cryptographic Information (CCI) that is
      unclassified may be shipped overnight.
      6.3.2.3. Carrier personnel should not be notified that the package contains classified material.
      6.3.2.4. Packages are typically shipped on Monday through Thursday only. This ensures that the
      package does not remain in the possession of the carrier service over a weekend. However, the
      security manager may approve shipment on other days providing the receiver has appropriate pro-
      cedures in place. These procedures must ensure that a cleared person will receive and sign for the
      package on Saturday, Sunday, or holidays, and that he or she is able to secure the package in
      approved storage. [DOD 4525.8-M.]
      6.3.2.5. The sender is responsible for ensuring that an authorized person will be available to
      receive the delivery and for verification of the correct mailing address.

6.7. General Provisions [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.3.]
   6.7.1. Authorization [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.3.1.1.]
       6.7.1.1. The unit commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief authorizes appropriately cleared
       couriers to handcarry classified material on commercial flights. See DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph
       C7.3.1.2., for required documentation and this AFI, paragraph 6.1.1., for a cautionary statement
       regarding handcarrying classified material.
       6.7.1.2. The unit commander or equivalent, staff agency chief, or security manager authorizes
       appropriately cleared couriers to handcarry classified material by means other than on commercial
       flights.
       6.7.1.3. (Added-AFMC) As a minimum, couriers must have verbal authorization to hand-carry
       classified material outside their normal work areas. This approval alone is sufficient when the cou-
       rier remains within the confines of an access controlled installation perimeter and does not pass
       through an entry/exit personnel control point.
   6.7.2. Security managers or supervisors brief each authorized member handcarrying classified mate-
   rial [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.3.1.2.]
   6.7.3. Each Air Force activity or unit that releases classified material to personnel for handcarrying:
   [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.3.1.1.]
       6.7.3.1. Maintains a list of all classified material released.
       6.7.3.2. Keeps the list until they confirm all the material reaches the recipient’s activity or unit.

6.8. Documentation. Unit commanders or equivalents, staff agency chiefs, or security managers issue
and control DD Form 2501 (Safeguard), Courier Authorization (available through the Air Force Publi-
cations Distribution system), for handcarrying classified material by means other than on commercial
flights. This doesn’t preclude the use of a courier authorization letter for infrequent courier situations.
EXCEPTION: Documentation is not necessary when handcarrying classified information to activities
within an installation (i.e., Air Force installation, missile field, or leased facilities within the local com-
muting area). NOTE: Account for DD Form 2501 (Safeguard) as prescribed in AFI 33-360, Volume 2,
Content Management Program-Information Management Tool (CMP-IMT) [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
C73.2.2.]
6.8. (AFMC) Documentation. Use a courier authorization letter or DD Form 2501, Courier Authoriza-
tion when hand-carrying classified within the local area (on base and off base) when the courier is
required to pass through an installation check point or entry point. A courier must carry an authorization
letter when traveling outside the local area or aboard commercial passenger aircraft and the DD Form
2501 may serve as a form of courier identification. Otherwise, secure the completed DD 2501 within the
issuing organization.

                             SECURITY EDUCATION AND TRAINING

Section 8A—Policy

8.1. General Policy. Effective information security training is a cornerstone of the Air Force Informa-
tion Security Program. All Air Force personnel need information security training whether they have
access to classified information or not. All Air Force personnel are individually responsible for protecting
the national interests of the United States. All security infractions and/or violations must be immediately
reported, circumstances examined and those responsible held accountable and appropriate corrective
action taken. Commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs are responsible for ensuring that per-
sonnel are knowledgeable and understand their responsibility to protect information and resources
deemed vital to national security.

8.2. Methodology. The Air Force will provide information security training to its personnel and contrac-
tors, as appropriate, on a continuous basis using government and commercial training sources. Various
training methods will be used to administer training, such as classroom instruction, one-on-one, com-
puter-based, and other distant learning training media. The Air Force will maintain a cadre of trained pro-
fessional career security personnel and security managers to administer, implement, and measure the
program’s effectiveness. When funds and resources permit, professional security personnel and security
managers should attend in-residence type training courses.

8.3. Roles and Responsibilities.
   8.3.1. These roles and responsibilities are in addition to those listed in paragraph 1.3.
   8.3.2. The AFSFC, Security Forces Training (AFSFC/SFWT), is responsible for coordinating devel-
   opment of Air Force specific information security training course materials and curriculums.
   8.3.3. Commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs are responsible for implementing the
   information security training program, developing supplemental training tools, and assessing the
   health of their programs on a continuous basis. In addition, they will:
       8.3.3.1. Ensure appointed security managers receive training through the ISPM within 90 days of
       their assignment and that the training is annotated in the individual’s official personnel file (OPF)
       or military training record.
       8.3.3.2. Budget for security awareness training products, materials, and the formal training of
       security managers.
       8.3.3.3. Actively support and monitor security education training.
       8.3.3.4. Ensure records are maintained on a calendar year basis of personnel attending initial,
       refresher and specialized information security training. As a minimum, these records must reflect
       the date(s) training was conducted and the name of personnel in attendance.
   8.3.4. Supervisors will conduct and/or ensure personnel receive training as required by this instruc-
   tion, document it when required, and ensure credit is given for course completion or briefing atten-
   dance, as appropriate.

        8.3.5.5. Assisting security managers in the development of unit specific lesson plans, motiva-
        tional materials and training aids.
        8.3.5.5. (AFMC) ISPMs are encouraged to invite OPRs for other security disciplines such as
        OPSEC, COMPUSEC and Counter Intelligence (CI) to include their training in the ISPM sched-
        ule. This will minimize the training footprint on each serviced organization and show the correla-
        tion of these security disciplines.
        8.3.5.6. Publicly recognizing the training efforts of effective security managers.
        8.3.5.7. Providing civilian employees who complete information security managers training with

        the contractor with access to the on-line system.”
        8.3.5.10. When contractors require Information Security work center training, the ISPM must
        approve the contractor’s enrollment in any web-based training course. In addition, the ISPM must
        notify, in writing, the 37 TRS/DORM Training Manager of this action, to include the contractor’s
        name, SSAN, contract number, and contractor’s cage code and contract performance location. The
        request may be Faxed to DSN 473-4150.
     8.3.6. Security Managers are responsible for:
        8.3.6.1. Ensuring security training is conducted as outlined in this AFI.

                                                 Chapter 9

          ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL COMPROMISE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

9.1. Policy. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C10.]
     9.1.1. It is Air Force policy that security incidents will be thoroughly investigated to minimize any
     possible damage to national security. The investigation will identify appropriate corrective actions
     that will be immediately implemented to prevent future security incidents. Further, if the security inci-
     dent leads to the actual or potential compromise of classified information, a damage assessment will
     be conducted to judge the effect that the compromise has on national security.
     9.1.2. Suspected instances of unauthorized public disclosure of classified information shall be
     reported promptly and investigated to determine the nature and circumstances of the suspected disclo-
     sure, the extent of the damage to national security, and the corrective and disciplinary action to be
     taken [DODD 5210.50, Para 4.]

9.2. Definitions.
     9.2.1. Security incidents as used in this AFI pertain to any security violation or infraction as defined
     in EO 12958, as amended. Security incidents may be categorized as:
        9.2.1.1. Security Violation. Any knowing, willful or negligent action:
            9.2.1.1.1. That could reasonably be expected to result in an unauthorized disclosure of classi-
            fied information.
            9.2.1.1.2. To classify or continue the classification of information contrary to the require-
            ments of this order or its implementing directives.
            9.2.1.1.3. To create or continue a SAP contrary to the requirements of EO 12958, as amended.
        9.2.1.2. Security Infraction. Any knowing, willful or negligent action contrary to the require-
        ments of EO 12958, as amended that is not a security violation.
     9.2.2. A compromise of classified information occurs when unauthorized individuals have had access
     to the classified information. Unauthorized individuals include those individuals with the appropriate
     security clearance but do not have a valid need-to-know.
     9.2.3. A potential compromise of classified information is when an investigating official concludes
     that a compromise of classified information has more than likely occurred as a result of a security inci-
     dent.

9.3. Information System (IS) Deviations. Coordinate all security deviations involving information sys-
tems with the local ISPM and the supporting information assurance office to begin an evaluation on the
impact of the incident to national security and the organization’s operations. If COMSEC material is
involved, refer to AFI 33-212, Reporting COMSEC Deviations (will be incorporated in AFI 33-201, Vol-
ume 3, COMSEC User Requirements)).

9.4. Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Incidents. Safeguard all SCI material and report
incidents involving SCI to the Special Security Officer.
AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007                                                                       63


9.5. Special Access Program (SAP) Incidents Report security incidents involving DOD SAP materiel
through local SAP channels to the Director, Special Programs OUSD(P).

9.6. Classification.
   9.6.1. Classify security incident notices, appointment of inquiry official memorandums, and security
   incident reports at the same level of classification as the information compromised if they contain
   classified information or if they provide sufficient information that would enable unauthorized indi-
   viduals to access the classified information in an unsecured environment. In the latter case, the docu-
   mentation must remain classified until the information has been retrieved and appropriately
   safeguarded. Do not classify memorandums and reports pertaining to security incidents that have
   occurred in the information system environment when the system has been appropriately purged and
   the correspondence does not contain other classified information.
       9.6.1.1. Classify security incident notices, memorandums, and reports according to the classified
       source from which they are derived. Refer to DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 3.
       9.6.1.2. Mark security incident notices, memorandums, and reports using derivative classification
       procedures. Refer to DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 5.
   9.6.2. All security incident reports will, as a minimum, be marked “For Official Use Only.” Refer to
   DOD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement, Freedom of Information Act Program.

9.7. Public Release. Security incident reports cannot be released into the public domain until they have
undergone a security review [Reference AFI 35-101, Chapter 15.] Unauthorized disclosure of classified
information to the public must be processed IAW DODD 5210.50.

9.8. Reporting and Notifications.
   9.8.1. Personnel who learn of a security incident must immediately report it to their commander or
   equivalent, supervisor, or security manager who will in-turn report the incident to the servicing ISPM
   by the end of the first duty day.
   9.8.2. After assigning a case number beginning with calendar year, base, and sequential number for
   tracking purposes, the ISPM will:
       9.8.2.1. Coordinate with the organization security manager to ensure the commander or equiva-
       lent, or staff agency chief has been briefed on the incident. The ISPM will brief the commander or
       equivalent, or staff agency chief if the security manager is unable to do so or when the incident is
       reported directly to the ISPM.
       9.8.2.2. Report compromises/potential compromises for the following incidents through com-
       mand ISPM channels to HQ USAF/XOS-FI:
       9.8.2.2. (AFMC) The servicing ISPM will notify HQ AFMC Information Security Manager by
       the end of the next duty day following discovery of compromises/potential compromises.

            9.8.2.2.7. Disclosure to foreign nationals.
        9.8.2.3. Notify the local AFOSI when the circumstances involve criminal activity or foreign intel-
        ligence agencies.
        9.8.2.4. Notify SAF/AAZ through the appropriate SAP channels when the compromise involves
        special access information.
     9.8.3. The appointing authority will notify the OCA, or the originator when the OCA is not known,
     when it is determined there is a compromise, potential compromise, or loss of classified information.
     Refer to paragraph 9.6.1. of this AFI for security classification marking requirements.

9.9. Preliminary Inquiry. An informal inquiry to determine if classified information has been lost or
compromised so that a damage assessment can be completed and the appropriate corrective action can be
taken.
     9.9.1. The commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief of the activity responsible for the security
     incident will appoint an inquiry official to conduct a preliminary inquiry. See Attachment 5 for a
     sample appointment memorandum. Refer to paragraph 9.6.1. of this AFI for appointment memoran-
     dum classification requirements. The guidelines for selection of the inquiry/investigative official are
     found in paragraph 9.11.2.
     9.9.1. (AFMC) Appoint the preliminary inquiry official by the end of the first duty day following dis-
     covery.
        9.9.1.1. When security incidents occur because of unauthorized transmission of classified mate-
        rial, the sending activity appoints the inquiry official and conducts the inquiry.
        9.9.1.2. Inquiry officials will coordinate their actions with the servicing ISPM and the staff judge
        advocate’s office.
     9.9.2. The preliminary inquiry will determine if classified material was compromised, the extent of
     the compromise, and the circumstances surrounding the compromise.
     9.9.3. A preliminary inquiry report will be completed using the sample report format at Attachment
     6 and submitted to the appointing official through the ISPM. The ISPM will provide their concur-
     rence/nonconcurrence with the report and forward it to the appointing official for action. Refer to
     paragraph 9.6. of this AFI for report classification requirements.
     9.9.3. (AFMC) The preliminary inquiry official forwards the preliminary inquiry report to the
     appointing official within 30 duty days from appointment. The appointing official may grant exten-
     sions when fully justified.
     9.9.4. The report from the preliminary inquiry will be sufficient to resolve the security incident if:
        9.9.4.1. The inquiry determines that loss or compromise of classified information has not
        occurred.
AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007                                                                        65


      9.9.4.2. The inquiry determines that loss or compromise of classified information has occurred,
      but there is no indication of significant security weakness.
      9.9.4.3. The appointing official determines that no additional information will be obtained by
      conducting a formal investigation.
   9.9.5. If the report from the preliminary inquiry is not sufficient to resolve the security incident, the
   appointing authority initiates a formal investigation. The preliminary inquiry report will become part
   of any formal investigation. If the inquiry is closed out as a compromise or potential compromise the
   appointing authority notifies the OCA to perform a damage assessment.
   9.9.6. If the inquiry reveals suspected unauthorized disclosure to the public notify HQ USAF/XOS-FI
   through ISPM channels. [DODD5210.50, Para 5.2.1.] Classify security incident notices, memoran-
   dums, and reports according to the classified source from which they are derived. Refer to DOD
   5200.1-R, Chapter 3. Specifically address:
      9.9.6.1. When, where, and how the incident occurred.
      9.9.6.2. Was classified information compromised?
      9.9.6.3. If compromise occurred, what specific classified information and/or material was
      involved?
      9.9.6.4. If classified information is alleged to have been lost, what steps were taken to locate the
      material?
      9.9.6.5. In what specific media article or program did the classified information appear?

      responsible for the compromise?
      9.9.6.10. Will further inquiry increase the damage caused by the compromise?
   9.9.7. Submit a completed Department of Justice (DoJ) Media leak Questionnaire, available from
   https://wwwmil.lackland.af.mil/afsf/ through ISPM channels to USD(I), who will coordinate with
   DOD General Counsel to determine whether a referral to the DoJ for prosecution is warranted.

9.10. Damage Assessment.
   9.10.1. A damage assessment is an analysis to determine the effect of a compromise of classified
   information on the national security. It will be initiated by the OCA upon notification of a potential or
   actual compromise to verify and reevaluate the information involved. Damage assessment reports will
   be classified and marked according to the classification guidance provided on the information being
   addressed in the reports.
      9.10.1.1. (Added-AFMC) The OCA, upon learning that a compromise or possible compromise
      of specific classified information has occurred and is reasonably expected to cause damage to
      national security, shall prepare a written damage assessment. While there are no time limits for
      completion of the damage assessment, initiate the assessment upon notification and complete
66                                                            AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007


        without undue delay. The OCA must determine whether the damage assessment itself is classified
        and mark and process accordingly.
        9.10.1.2. (Added-AFMC) As a minimum, damage assessments contain the identification of the
        source, date and circumstances of the compromise; classification of the specific information lost
        or compromised; a description of the specific information lost or compromised; an analysis and
        statement of the known or probable damage to the national security; an assessment of the possible
        advantages to foreign powers; an assessment of the original classification decision regarding the
        information involved; and an assessment of whether countermeasures are appropriate and feasible
        to negate or minimize the effect of the compromise.
     9.10.2. The OCA must:
        9.10.2.1. Verify the classification and duration of classification initially assigned to the informa-
        tion. If the OCA determines the information should be declassified, the reporting activity will be
        notified.
        9.10.2.2. Set up damage assessment controls and procedures.
        9.10.2.3. Provide a copy of the damage assessment to the inquiry or investigating official.
        9.10.2.4. (Added-AFMC) OCAs must maintain records of damage assessments they prepare in a
        manner that facilitates their retrieval and use. Dispose of the records IAW the Air Force Records
        Disposition Schedule. OCAs provide a copy of damage assessments to the servicing ISPM for
        attachment to the file copy of the security incident.

9.11. Formal Investigation.
     9.11.1. A formal investigation is a detailed examination of evidence to determine the extent and seri-
     ousness of the compromise of classified information. The formal investigation will fix responsibility
     for any disregard (deliberate or inadvertent) of governing directives which led to the security incident.
     9.11.1. (AFMC) Investigations include identification of the source, date and circumstances of the
     compromise; complete description and classification of each item of classified information compro-
     mised; a thorough search for the classified information; identification of any person or procedure
     responsible for the compromise; an analysis and statement of the known or probable damage to the
     national security that has resulted or may result, and the cause of the loss or compromise; or a state-
     ment that compromise did not occur or that there is minimal risk of damage to the national security.
     9.11.2. The commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief of the activity responsible for the security
     incident, will appoint an investigative official to conduct an investigation.
        9.11.2.1. The appointment letter provides authority to conduct an investigation, swear witnesses,
        and examine/copy documents, files and other data relevant to the inquiry.
        9.11.2.2. The investigative official is the personal representative of the Appointing Authority and/
        or the Commander. The investigative official must be impartial, unbiased, objective, thorough,
        and available.
        9.11.2.3. The investigative official must be a commissioned officer, senior NCO (E-7 and above),
        or a civil service employee equivalent (GS-9 and above).

       9.11.2.4. The investigation will be the investigative official’s only duty (unless the Appointing
       Authority determines otherwise) until the report is completed and approved by the Appointing
       Authority.
       9.11.2.5. Appointing Authorities will not appoint an investigative official who is retiring, separat-
       ing, or being reassigned within 180 days.
   9.11.3. The formal investigation will include the preliminary inquiry if one has been conducted.

9.12. Management and Oversight.
   9.12.1. The inquiry/investigative official will route the completed report through the servicing ISPM
   for review before forwarding it to the appointing authority.
   9.12.2. The appointing authority will:
       9.12.2.1. Close the inquiry/investigation unless MAJCOM/FOA/DRU directives indicate other-
       wise.

                        CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION

A2.1. For Official Use Only (FOUO). FOUO is a designation that is applied to unclassified information
that is exempt from automatic release to the public under FOIA. See DOD 5400.7-R/AF Supplement for
further guidance [Ref: DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 3, Para AP3.2.]
   A2.1.1. Access to FOUO Information.
       A2.1.1.1. No person may have access to information designated as FOUO unless that person has
       been determined to have a valid need for such access in connection with the accomplishment of a
       lawful and authorized Government purpose.
       A2.1.1.2. The final responsibility for determining whether an individual has a valid need for
       access to information designated as FOUO rests with the individual who has authorized posses-
       sion, knowledge or control of the information and not on the prospective recipient.
       A2.1.1.3. Information designated as FOUO may be disseminated within the DOD Components
       and between officials of DOD Components and DOD contractors, consultants, and grantees to
       conduct official business for the DOD, provided that dissemination is not further controlled by a
       Distribution Statement.
       A2.1.1.4. DOD holders of information designated as FOUO are authorized to convey such infor-
       mation to officials in other Departments and Agencies of the Executive and Judicial Branches to
       fulfill a government function. If the information is covered by the Privacy Act, disclosure is only
       authorized if the requirements of AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program, are satisfied.
       A2.1.1.5. Release of FOUO information to Congress is governed by AFI 90-401, Air Force Rela-
       tions With Congress. If the Privacy Act covers the information, disclosure is authorized if the
       requirements of DOD 5400.11-R are also satisfied.
       A2.1.1.6. DOD Directive 7650.1, General Accounting Office (GAO) and Comptroller General
       Access to Records, governs release of FOUO information to the Government Accountability
       Office (GAO). If the Privacy Act covers the information, disclosure is authorized if the require-
       ments of DOD 5400.11-R are also satisfied.
   A2.1.2. Protection of FOUO Information.
       A2.1.2.1. During working hours, reasonable steps shall be taken to minimize risk of access by
       unauthorized personnel. After working hours, store FOUO information in unlocked containers,
       desks or cabinets if Government or Government-contract building security is provided. If such
       building security is not provided, store the information in locked desks, file cabinets, bookcases,
       locked rooms, etc.
       A2.1.2.2. FOUO information and material may be transmitted via first class mail, parcel post or,
       for bulk shipments, via fourth-class mail. Electronic transmission of FOUO information, e.g.,
       voice, data or facsimile, e-mail, shall be by approved secure communications systems or systems
       utilizing access controls such as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), whenever practical.
80                                                              AFI31-401_AFMCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2007


        A2.1.2.3. FOUO information may only be posted to DOD Web sites consistent with security and
        access requirements specified in Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum, dated 25 November
        1998, Subject: “Web Site Administration”.
        A2.1.2.4. Record copies of FOUO documents shall be disposed of according to the Federal
        Records Act and the DOD Component records management directives. Non-record FOUO docu-
        ments may be destroyed by any of the means approved for the destruction of classified informa-
        tion, or by any other means that would make it difficult to recognize or reconstruct the
        information.
     A2.1.3. Unauthorized Disclosure. The unauthorized disclosure of FOUO does not constitute an unau-
     thorized disclosure of DOD information classified for security purposes. However, appropriate
     administrative action shall be taken to fix responsibility for unauthorized disclosure of FOUO when-
     ever feasible, and appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken against those responsible. Unautho-
     rized disclosure of FOUO information that is protected by the Privacy Act may also result in civil and
     criminal sanctions against responsible persons. The Military Department or other DOD Component
     that originated the FOUO information shall be informed of its unauthorized disclosure.

A2.2. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive.
     A2.2.1. Law Enforcement Sensitive is a marking sometimes applied, in addition to/conjunction with
     the marking FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY, by the Department of Justice and other activities in the law
     enforcement community. It is intended to denote that the information was compiled for law enforce-
     ment purposes and should be afforded appropriate security in order to protect certain legitimate gov-
     ernment interests, including the protection of: enforcement proceedings; the right of a person to a fair
     trial or an impartial adjudication; grand jury information; personal privacy including records about
     individuals requiring protection under the Privacy Act; the identity of a confidential source, including
     a State, Local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on
     a confidential basis; information furnished by a confidential source; proprietary information; tech-

     A2.2.2. Markings.
        A2.2.2.1. In unclassified documents containing Law Enforcement Sensitive information, the
        words “Law Enforcement Sensitive” shall accompany the words “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY”
        at the top and bottom of the front cover (if there is one), the title page (if there is one), and the out-
        side of the back cover (if there is one).
        A2.2.2.2. In unclassified documents, each page containing FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law
        Enforcement Sensitive information shall be marked “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforce-
        ment Sensitive” at the top and bottom. Classified documents containing such information shall be
        marked as required by Chapter 5, DOD 5200.1-R except that pages containing Law Enforcement
        Sensitive information but no classified information will be marked “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
        Law Enforcement Sensitive” top and bottom.
        A2.2.2.3. Portions of DOD classified or unclassified documents that contain FOR OFFICIAL
        USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive information shall be marked “(FOUO-LES)” at the

       beginning of the portion. This applies to classified, as well as to unclassified documents. If a por-
       tion of a classified document contains both classified and FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law
       Enforcement Sensitive information, the appropriate classification designation is sufficient to pro-
       tect the information.
   A2.2.3. Access to FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive. The criteria for allow-
   ing access to FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive are the same as those used for
   FOUO information, except that if the information also bears the marking “Originator Control” or
   “ORCON” the information may not be disseminated beyond the original distribution without the
   approval of the originating office.
   A2.2.4. Protection of FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive. Within the DoD,
   FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive shall be protected as required for FOUO
   information.

A2.3. Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) Information. SBU information is information originated
within the Department of State that warrants a degree of protection and administrative control and meets
the criteria for exemption from mandatory public disclosure under FOIA. When SBU information is
included in DOD documents, it shall be marked as if the information were FOUO [Ref: DOD 5200.1-R,

                        SECURITY CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE (SCG)

A8.1. (Added-AFMC) Program managers having primary management responsibility for a classified
weapon system, plan, project, program (including a special access program), operation, equipment, or
item (herein referred to as a system) must publish a formal SCG for each system they manage, if not pecu-
liar to and previously published in another SCG. When issuing changes for an SCG, you must review the
entire guide. At a minimum, disseminate a change letter to all parties on the SCG distribution list. Coor-
dinate administrative change letters with the necessary system wing authorities. The signature authority
for administrative change letters may not be delegated lower than the system senior security functional.
Identify the next review date no longer than 5 years from the date of the change. Submit DD Form 2024,
DoD Security Classification Guide Data Elements RCS: DD-C3I(B&AR)1418, IAW DoD 5200.1-R,
Section C2.5.3.5.

A8.2. (Added-AFMC) Servicing ISPMs at each installation monitor the review of SCGs issued by activ-
ities they service. They send a suspense notice to the OPR 90 days before the review date. The OPR then
issues changes as necessary. When major revisions to guides occur, the OPR must review for any change
of performance and cost involved for the contractor in relationship to the current DD Form 254, Contract
Security Classification Specification. Issue a revised DD Form 254 after publication of a new/revised
SCG or letter change to a SCG. When changes to the basic SCG occur, the country-unique document OPR
must evaluate them in order to update the existing document.
A8.3. (Added-AFMC) For SCGs sent to organizations or activities of other Air Force commands, pro-
vide an electronic copy to the MAJCOM ISPM office and to HQ AFMC/A7SX.
A8.4. (Added-AFMC) Country-unique security classification documents (guides) developed in support
of foreign governments or foreign contractor work performance and approved for release under National
Disclosure Policy must contain a statement prohibiting release or disclosure of contents to third countries
and their nationals. They must be maintained IAW applicable Executive Orders governing the classifica-
tion of information.

A8.5. (Added-AFMC) SCGs are not releasable to foreign nationals or governments except as stated in
paragraph A8.4. (Added) above. Use a DD Form 254 to convey contractual security classification guid-
ance to foreign contractors. For procurement actions with complex security classification considerations,
attach only those extracted portions of an approved SCG applicable to the foreign contractual perfor-
mance to the DD Form 254, provided they are releasable to the foreign government under National Dis-
closure Policy.
A8.6. (Added-AFMC) Contractor participation in preparation of SCGs is encouraged. However, if more
than one contractor is involved in performance of a contract, ensure all have the opportunity to comment
and make recommendations for SCG changes.
A8.7. (Added-AFMC) Coordinate all SCGs, changes or revisions with the servicing ISPM before publi-
cation, except for guides containing SCI. Also, as appropriate, coordinate guides with the senior intelli-
gence officer (SIO), Public Affairs, Foreign Disclosure, OPSEC and COMSEC officers.
A8.8. (Added-AFMC) Use one classification designation, e.g., U, C, S, or TS under the classification
column. Do not use U-TS, C-S etc. This forces the reader to make an original classification decision.

Explain any differences in classification in the remarks column. The remarks column clarifies classifica-
tion guidance when required.
A8.9. (Added-AFMC) The servicing ISPM classification management specialist keeps on file:
     - A current DoD 5200.1-R and DoD 5200-1H.
     - One copy of classification guides (and changes/revisions) issued by activities they service.
     - Related DD Forms 2024.
     - Other SCGs necessary to support activities serviced.
A8.10. (Added-AFMC) Review distribution list upon revisions to SCGs to ensure only activities requir-
