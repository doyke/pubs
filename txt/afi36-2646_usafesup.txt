4.7.7.1. (Added) Units equipped with simulation equipment will incorporate it into their
training plan. This training will not replace Force on Force requirements or weapons

training to fulfill requirements identified in ACO 80-6/ECI 6801.01, and ACO 80-6/ECI
6801.01, USAFE Supplements 1 and 2. Force-on-force training requires the use of OPFOR
armed with blank ammunition or dye marking cartridges, simulated explosives, MILES
equipment, and will be documented in AFTR. GCS training does not fulfill this requirement
unless it meets the same criteria as outlined in the ACE Directive. Units shall conduct the
training in as realistic an environment as possible (e.g. vault storage area, convoy routes). Units
shall strongly consider conducting a force-on-force exercise at night.
4.8.1. (Added) Ground Combat Skills (GCS) and force-on-force training uses opposition
forces (OPFOR) armed with blank ammunition, simulated explosives, and Multiple Integrated
Laser Engagement System (MILES) equipment, when available, to train defense forces and
identify security deficiencies. The OPFOR attempts to elicit a unit response to a ground threat.
Live intruder play (LIP) areas are determined by base officials. When exercises involve live
intruders–OPFOR, safety will be the paramount concern. Units must establish written guidance
defining live intruder exercise ground rules. Written guidance must include, but not be limited to:
4.8.1.1. (Added) In any area where LIP is being conducted, members participating in exercises
will be either normal security forces armed with live ammunition, or forces armed with blanks
and blank adapters. At no time will some response forces carry live ammunition while others are
using blanks.
4.8.1.2. (Added) Members performing as OPFOR will NOT be issued a weapon with live
ammunition.
4.8.1.3. (Added) OPFOR will not use blank ammunition against normal security posts.
4.8.1.4. (Added) Controllers and trainers who are issued weapons and live ammunition for
weapons protection purposes will not be incorporated into the scenario and the unit must have a
“standard” method to make these personnel readily identifiable to all personnel. This can be
accomplished by the use of brightly colored vests, armbands, etc.
4.8.1.5. (Added) Establish separate weapons and ammunition issue periods at the armory for
normal security posting and personnel taking part in the exercise and training scenario, to
preclude confusion.
4.8.1.6. (Added) When LIP exercises are conducted in areas for which normal security posts
are responsible and in the event an actual Security Forces response is required for normal
operations, clear instructions must be established to immediately halt the exercise.
4.8.1.7. (Added) Additionally, during force-on-force exercises where blank ammunition is
used, exercise participants shall be separated from on-duty forces.
5.4.3.5.1.2. (Added) MAJCOM will not incorporate a written evaluation in the DPE process.
