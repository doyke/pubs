SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This manual
incorporates extensive changes from AFI 31-204 which it replaces and must be thoroughly
reviewed by the reader. Among other things, this manual: incorporates current terminology and
standards related to testing for the presence of alcohol and drugs used by the National Highway
AFMAN31-116_USAFASUP 13 AUGUST 2012                                                                                                          3


Traffic Safety Administration; describes the processes to be used in the collection of evidence
and action on traffic reports; includes guidance on matters ranging from registration of vehicles
to establishment of base traffic management programs; and sets minimum traffic enforcement
goals for Defense Force commanders

(USAFA) Acronyms and office symbols were spelled out first time mentioned. Suspension and
revocation periods for off-base offenses were further defined for clarification. Major versus
minor vehicle accidents were further defined for clarification. The reporting location for
personnel involved in a minor vehicle accident was changed from Building 8024, 10th Security
Forces Squadron (10 SFS) to the Pass and Registration Center (PRC). All requirements for
installation vehicle registration were removed and responsibility for cadet area parking passes
was transferred from the PRC to the Commandant of Cadets, Support Division
(USAFA/CWTM).

(USAFA) This interim change adds a DUI awards and recognition program for USAFA;
removes cadet area sticker requirements; changes the reporting location for minor vehicle
accidents to the BDOC; adds points for driving without a driver’s license and driving without
insurance; and permits 10 SFS to issue citations for a traffic complaint if the patrolman witnesses
the violation.

                                   DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges. Each Installation Commander will determine if
international driver’s licenses will be recognized and authorized for use on the installation. Take
into consideration the local (civilian) jurisdiction’s policy on recognition and acceptance of
international driver’s licenses. As a general rule, most CONUS civilian jurisdictions will honor
use of international driver’s licenses for short periods of time by non-resident visitors and
assigned military personnel and dependents. When practical, Installation Commanders should
incorporate local guidance to prevent conflicts and confusion.
   2.1.1. (Added-USAFA) Driving on USAFA is a privilege granted by the 10 ABW/CC.
   Drivers who fail to comply with applicable traffic laws and instructions while driving within
   the legal boundaries of USAFA may have their driving privileges suspended or revoked.
   2.1.2. (Added-USAFA) The 10 ABW/CC has determined international drivers licenses are
   recognized and accepted on USAFA, IAW the state laws of Colorado.
       2.1.2.1. (Added-USAFA) Foreign operators must carry their driver’s license from their
       home country. International driver’s licenses are valid for a maximum period of 1 year.
       International driver’s licenses may be obtained through the American Automobile
       Association (AAA).
       2.1.2.2. (Added-USAFA) Military personnel returning from an overseas assignment
       with an international driver’s license must obtain a valid U.S. driver’s license within 30
       days of return.
2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
   2.2.1. AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism, require Installation
   Commanders to develop instructions and guidance that detail stop, inspection, search and
   impoundment of motor vehicles at CONUS installation entry gates, to include Air Force
   restricted and controlled areas.
   2.2.2. MAJCOMs responsible for overseas military installations must provide their
   Installation Commanders with written guidelines governing stop, inspection, search and
   impoundment of vehicles. This guidance must reflect host nation agreements and pass
   appropriate legal review. Note: A combatant commander or those commanding unified forces
   may direct guidance covering all installations under their command. In this case, MAJCOMs
   must review those policies before issuing their guidance.
   2.2.3. (Added-USAFA) The 10th Security Forces Squadron (10 SFS) is responsible for
   traffic enforcement (i.e., traffic stops, etc.) on USAFA; however, due to USAFA’s concurrent
   jurisdiction, local law enforcement personnel (i.e., El Paso County Sheriff’s Office (EPSO),
   Colorado Springs Police Department (CSPD), Colorado State Police (CSP), etc.) are
   authorized, by law, to assist with traffic enforcement.
       2.2.3.1. (Added-USAFA) The 10 SFS personnel may conduct traffic stops and
       inspections of any vehicle on USAFA for reasons specified in this instruction and other
       governing directives, or if they believe the vehicle is unsafe or not properly equipped, as
 8                                             AFMAN31-116_USAFASUP 13 AUGUST 2012


        required by law. If a 10 SFS member determines a vehicle is in such condition that
        further operation would be hazardous, the vehicle will be driven to the nearest garage,
        place of safety, or immediately removed from USAFA. Should a 10 SFS entry controller
        detect a serious or hazardous violation, the vehicle will be denied entry to USAFA.
2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath or Urine Tests. This requirement must be outlined as
part of installation newcomers briefings and/or inprocessing of newly assigned personnel. Refer
to AFI 31-218 (I) for specific information.
2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. In addition to those conditions for
impoundment listed in AFI 31-218(I), paragraph 2-3, local situations may arise that require
impoundment. The determination will be made by the Installation Commander or designee.
Installation and unit commanders must view the abandonment of personal property as a
personnel management issue and be diligent in deterring occurrences. Commanders must include
the consequences when personal property is abandoned during familiarization and indoctrination
training into units. Additionally, measures must be established to ensure personal effects are
cleared prior to personnel departing on permanent change-of-station orders.
     2.4.1. (Added-USAFA) The Defense Force Commander (DFC) is designated as the
     impoundment authority. The 10 SFS/S3 has been delegated approval authority to have a
     towing company contacted for vehicle impoundment on USAFA. The on-duty 10 SFS Flight
     Chief (S3OA-D) and Investigator (S2I) will contact 10 SFS/S3 to obtain approval to tow
     vehicles. Refer to AFI 31-206 USAFA Supplement, Security Forces Investigation Program,
     for further guidance on vehicle impoundment and processing procedures.
2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges. Installation Commanders must
incorporate procedures governing suspension and revocation in base publications or as a
supplement to this instruction. Make these known to the base population. AF will follow the
administrative due process for suspensions detailed in AFI 31-218(I).
     2.5.1. Suspensions.
        2.5.1.1. Installation Commanders determine suspension and revocation guidance for non-
        moving violations, as well as what constitutes a non-moving violation on their
        installation (i.e., performing unauthorized repair; failure to register and insure vehicles;
        unauthorized modifications or alterations; failure to maintain safety standards, etc).
        Make these standards part of the local installation traffic code and take reasonable steps
        to make them known to the general public.
        2.5.1.2. Persons under the age of 21, when in the United States or where legal alcohol
        consumption age is 21, operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC level standard of
        .01 or higher is reason for automatic suspension. Refer to AFI 31-218(I) 2-
        4.a.(3).(a).(b).(c).(d). for additional guidance.
        2.5.1.3. The .08 blood alcohol limit for presumptive intoxication determination may be
        reduced to reflect a more stringent local, state or host nation standard.
     2.5.2. Revocation.
        2.5.2.1. The Installation Commander will immediately revoke driving privileges for a
        period of not less than 1 year when a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs
AFMAN31-116_USAFASUP 13 AUGUST 2012                                                                   9


        and the Installation Commander determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is
        required to preserve public safety or the good order and discipline of military personnel.
        2.5.2.2. The DFC develops plans and procedures to forward revocation, suspension and
        driving records to gaining commanders and to initiate appropriate staff action when
        receiving similar records from losing commanders of inbound personnel.
        2.5.2.3. Installation Commanders may impose multiple suspensions to run consecutively
        or concurrently.
            2.5.2.3.1. (Added-USAFA) In cases of multiple suspensions or revocations, the 10
            MSG/CC imposes the periods to run consecutively.
    2.5.3. (Added-USAFA) Suspensions and revocations issued by another installation or
    service component will be honored by USAFA.
        2.5.3.1. (Added-USAFA) Upon notification of an inbound or newly arrived individual
        with suspended or revoked driving privileges, the 10th Security Forces Squadron,
        Reports and Analysis Section (10 SFS/S5R) will notify the individual’s gaining unit
        commander, to ensure the individual is aware his/her suspension or revocation is still in
        effect on USAFA. Individuals will be added to the Suspension/Revocation/Debarment
        (SRB) Listing through the Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS).
        2.5.3.2. (Added-USAFA) Subsequently, the 10th Force Support Squadron (10 FSS) will
        include 10 SFS/S5R in the virtual Military Personnel Flight (vMPF) outprocessing
        checklist. The 10 SFS/S5R will follow procedures identified in AFMAN 31-201V7,
        Security Forces Administration and Reports (SFAR/S5R), for forwarding
        suspension/revocation records to gaining units during reassignment.
    2.5.4. (Added-USAFA) Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
        2.5.4.1. (Added-USAFA) Suspension/Revocation Guidelines. See Table 2.1. below for
        guidelines. NOTE: These guidelines only provide those provisions established
        specifically for USAFA outside of the directives listed in AFI 31-218_IP and AFMAN
        31-116; therefore, this is not all-inclusive and the 10 MSG/CC reserves the authority to
        determine suspensions/revocations considering the circumstantial evidence on a case-
        by-case basis.

months.
             2.5.4.1.1. (Added-USAFA) Each case will be reviewed by the USAFA Staff Judge
             Advocate (HQ USAFA/JA) and the 10 MSG/CC to make a final determination.
             Immediate suspension letters are routed and approved by HQ USAFA/JA and signed
             by 10 MSG/CC and do not require individual case reviews or approval.
          2.5.4.2. (Added-USAFA) The 10 SFS will issue a written notice of suspension or
          revocation from 10 MSG/CC.            The issued written notice specifies when the
          suspension/revocation becomes effective, which is 10 days after notification except for
          alcohol/drug related offenses, the period of time the suspension/revocation is effective
          for, and the administrative hearing and appeal process.
             2.5.4.2.1. (Added-USAFA) In the event an individual’s driving privileges have been
             suspended or revoked by 10 MSG/CC, active duty, including cadets and civilian-
             affiliated personnel, must report with their supervisor to 10 SFS/S5R to sign
             acknowledgement of the suspension/revocation.
                 2.5.4.2.1.1. (Added-USAFA) Civilian-nonaffiliated         personnel      (retirees,
                 dependents, etc.) will be contacted by certified mail. If after three documented
                 attempts, contact has not been made with the individual, the
                 suspension/revocation is immediate and considered a “refusal to sign.”
          2.5.4.3. (Added-USAFA) Unit commanders may request the suspension or revocation
          of driving privileges of personnel under their command by forwarding a digitally signed
          e-mail memorandum with supporting evidence/documents through 10 SFS/S5R (333-
          2006) addressed to the 10 MSG/CC for approval and signature.
             2.5.4.3.1. (Added-USAFA) If the request is approved, the individual will be
             directed to report to 10 SFS/S5R to sign/acknowledge receipt by endorsing the
             10 MSG/CC signed memorandum.
          2.5.4.4. (Added-USAFA) Suspensions and revocations will take place 10 days after
          written notice is received, unless an application for the hearing is made by the affected
          person within the period, except in alcohol-related cases of suspension or revocation.
             2.5.4.4.1. (Added-USAFA) Administrative Appeal/Hearing Requests.                  For
             individuals not involved in an alcohol or drug related driving incident, a request for
             administrative appeal/hearing can be requested by submitting a USAFA Form 28,
             Appeal Request for Traffic-Related Offense. Instructions for completing the form are
             included on the form. The suspension or revocation will not go into effect until a
             final determination is made by 10 MSG/CC.
                 2.5.4.4.1.1. (Added-USAFA) Requests for administrative appeals/hearing are
                 conducted by submitting a USAFA Form 28 to 10 SFS/S5R. The 10 SFS/S5R
                 will forward requests to the 10th Mission Support Group, Executive Assistant
                 (10 MSG/CCE), who will notify the individual of the hearing date.
                 2.5.4.4.1.2. (Added-USAFA) At this hearing, individuals may present evidence,
                 witnesses, and be represented by counsel. Military personnel can be represented
                 by civilian counsel (at their own expense) or assigned military counsel. Civilian
                 employees are entitled to have a personal representative present at the
AFMAN31-116_USAFASUP 13 AUGUST 2012                                                           11


             administrative hearing in accordance with applicable laws and instructions.
             2.5.4.4.1.3. (Added-USAFA) Failure to appear for the scheduled hearing
             without notification and approval from 10 MSG/CCE may result in forfeiture of
             the privilege to an administrative hearing.
          2.5.4.4.2. (Added-USAFA) Submission of a request for a hearing will stay the
          pending suspension or revocation.
          2.5.4.4.3. (Added-USAFA) If a hearing is not held within a 10-day period, the
          suspension or revocation will not take place until the person is granted a hearing
          before the 10 MSG/CC.
          2.5.4.4.4. (Added-USAFA) If the affected person requests the hearing be continued
          to a date beyond the 10-day period, the suspension or revocation shall normally
          become effective immediately upon receipt of the written notification.
      2.5.4.5. (Added-USAFA) Restoration Requests. Members whose driving privileges
      have been suspended may request restoration of driving privileges pending investigation
      or resolution of the incident by submitting a USAFA Form 28 for an appeal to 10
      SFS/S5R. The 10 SFS/S5R will forward the USAFA Form 28 to HQ USAFA/JA for
      review and to 10 MSG/CC for final determination. The USAFA Form 28 must be
      received by 10 SFS/S5R no later than 10-calendar days following the date of receipt of
      the suspension or revocation letter.
      2.5.4.6. (Added-USAFA) A notice to suspend an individual's driving privileges for off-
      base suspensions/revocations will be administered by 10 SFS/S5R immediately following
      receipt of the off-base adjudication.
      2.5.4.7. (Added-USAFA) Reinstatement of Driving Privileges. Unit commanders who
      wish to reinstate driving privileges for personnel under their command must submit a
      USAFA Form 28 to 10 SFS/S5R who will forward to the 10 MSG/CC for
      consideration/approval.
          2.5.4.7.1. (Added-USAFA) The USAFA Form 28 must contain justification for
          reinstatement. Once action is taken by 10 MSG/CC, the USAFA Form 28 is
          forwarded to 10 SFS/S5R for required action and filing. Once a month, 10 SFS/S5R
          notifies Safety (HQ USAFA/SE) of any changes in the driving privileges of personnel
          concerned. Refer to AFI 91-207 USAFA Supplement, The US Air Force Traffic
          Safety Program, for more information on safety’s role.
      2.5.4.8. (Added-USAFA) Any military member, DoD civilian, Nonappropriated Fund
      (NAF) civilian, privatized housing resident, or military family member whose base
      privileges are revoked as a result of a driving offense, other than alcohol-related driving
      offenses, may request limited driving privileges IAW Paragraph 2.5.4.1 of this
      supplement. Submit requests for limited driving privileges through 10 SFS/S5R
      addressed to 10 MSG/CC. NOTE: Limited driving privileges CANNOT be granted to
      individuals whose license has been revoked or suspended by state issuing authorities.
      HQ USAFA/JA will review the requests and provide a recommendation to 10 MSG/CC.
2.6. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs. After coordination with the SJA, unit commanders
will direct drug and/or alcohol testing within 24 hours of suspected alcohol related motor
 12                                            AFMAN31-116_USAFASUP 13 AUGUST 2012


vehicle/traffic incidents or misconduct, episodes of aberrant or bizarre behavior or where there is
reasonable suspicion of drug use and the member refuses to provide consent for testing.
Commanders are also encouraged to ensure Blood Alcohol Tests (BAT) are taken as soon after
the incident as possible to determine the level and intensity of alcohol involvement. For
additional information refer to AFI 31-218(I).
   2.6.1. (Added-USAFA) Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST). A SFST will only be
   conducted when the person consents voluntarily. The 10 SFS will make every attempt to
   administer the SFSTs at the scene. In accordance with National Highway Traffic Safety
   Administration, the Horizontal Gaze and Nystagmus (HGN)/Vertical Gaze and Nystagmus
   (VGN), Walk-And-Turn (WAT) and One-Leg-Stand (OLS), are the only authorized SFSTs.
   The results of the SFST will be documented on a DD Form 1920, Alcohol Incident Report.
       2.6.1.1. (Added-USAFA) If inclement weather or unsafe conditions exist which would
       invalidate the SFST result, the person may be transported to Building 8024 for
       completion. NOTE: SFSTs should be terminated if the individual is so intoxicated
       they cannot complete the maneuvers without risk of injury. The patrolman should
       ensure sufficient probable cause exists prior to transferring to Building 8024.
           2.6.1.1.1. (Added-USAFA) If a person fails or refuses the SFST they will be
           informed of Federal Implied Consent to a Breath Alcohol Content (BrAC) before
           being transported to Building 8024 for processing. Military personnel will be
           requested to provide either breath or blood for any alcohol/drug driving related
           offense. Military members are subject to search and seizure for their breath or blood.
           2.6.1.1.2. (Added-USAFA) If the subject consents to a BrAC, a Colorado State
           certified operator or instructor will conduct the breath test utilizing the Intoxilyzer
           5000EN. The Intoxilyzer 5000EN is the preferred method of determining a subject’s
           alcohol level on USAFA for both military and civilian personnel. If the Intoxilyzer is
           inoperative, the subject may be transported to another law enforcement agency to
           utilize their state certified instrument. Military members will be required to submit a
           blood sample if the Intoxilyzer is inoperative
               2.6.1.1.2.1. (Added-USAFA) Personnel operating the Intoxilyzer 5000EN will
               administer the test IAW Colorado State rules and regulations. All personnel
               authorized to operate the Intoxilyzer must attend the Colorado State Certification
               Course. Operators must maintain their certification to be authorized to operate
               the Intoxilyzer 5000EN.
       2.6.1.2. (Added-USAFA) Vehicle operators and detained subjects who refuse or fail a
       SFST will be detained and transported by 10 SFS to Building 8024 for processing.
   2.6.2. (Added-USAFA) DUI Processing. Vehicle operators will be cited for DUI when
   their BrAC on the state approved breath alcohol testing system, or blood alcohol content
   registers a 0.08 or higher.
       2.6.2.1. (Added-USAFA) The 10 SFS will request identification from all vehicle
       occupants. Underage personnel will be charged and processed IAW the CRS or UCMJ.
       2.6.2.2. (Added-USAFA) Military members and cadets under the age of 21 years who
       appear to be intoxicated will also be processed for underage drinking.
AFMAN31-116_USAFASUP 13 AUGUST 2012                                                         13


     2.6.2.3. (Added-USAFA) The 10 SFS may request suspects submit to a BrAC or blood
     alcohol content test. If drugs are suspected in the case of a military member (odor of
     marijuana, zero results on BrAC after failing SFSTs, etc.) and no available patrol is
     certified in VGN, a sample of blood will be taken. VGN is the preferred method for
     determining possible drug influence and should be utilized in all DUI stops along with
     the HGN.
     2.6.2.4. (Added-USAFA) Release military subjects to their commander, first sergeant,
     or designated representative using DD Form 2708, Receipt for Inmate or Detained
     Person.
     2.6.2.5. (Added-USAFA) Civilians may be released to an adult family member,
     relative, or friend. The BDOC will consult with HQ USAFA/JA prior to releasing any
     civilians on their own recognizance.
        2.6.2.5.1. (Added-USAFA) If the civilian is intoxicated to the point of being a
        danger to themselves or others, EPSO will be contacted and requested to respond,
        take custody of the subject, and transport to Criminal Justice Center or detoxification
        center.

3.5. Vehicle Registration at non Air Force Installations. Personnel who live or work on a
DoD Installation or who often use the facilities therein, may be required to register and be issued
a DD Form 2220, Vehicle Decal, for their vehicles at those locations.
3.6. Vehicle Registration at Air Force Installations. Personnel who possess appropriate
credentials to access Air Force Installations do not require a DD Form 2220. Although AFI 31-
218(I) requires vehicle registration, the Air Force was granted a waiver from this requirement.
Air Force Installations who continue to utilize the DD Form 2220 will use AFI 31-218(I) for
guidance and include any specific requirements for their location in the local traffic plan. The
Air Force will no longer produce DD Form 2220.
3.7. (Added-USAFA) Cadet Vehicle Registration Requirements. USAFA/CWTM may
develop local vehicle passes for cadet vehicles authorized to park within the cadet area or
designated cadet parking lots.
   3.7.1. (Added-USAFA) Cadets will register their vehicle within 5-duty days through the
   USAFA/CWTM, Cadet Vehicle Registration Area in accordance with Air Force
   Commandant of Cadets Manual (AFCWMAN) 36-3501, The Cadet Sight Picture.

4.1. Installation Traffic Codes.
   4.1.1. Restraint systems.
       4.1.1.1. Require the use of child safety seats consistent with state, territory or host nation
       laws. If there is no state, territory or host nation law, all children under 4 years of age
       regardless of weight or less than 50 pounds regardless of age shall be properly secured in
       an appropriate child restraint system. Children ages 4 through 7, weighing 50 pounds or
       more and less than 4 feet 9 inches shall be properly secured in a booster seat or other
       appropriate child restraint system. Children ages 8 and above and no less than 4 feet 9
       inches in height will be properly secured in a vehicle seat belt or booster seat. The child
       safety seat or booster seat will be certified by the manufacturer to meet all applicable
       Federal performance standards or host nation requirements and will be installed in
       accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
       4.1.1.2. All drivers and passengers on Air Force installations will wear seat belts, or in
       the case of infants, be properly restrained.
   4.1.2. Radar Detection Devices. The use of radars or laser detection devices are prohibited
   on Air Force Installations.
   4.1.3. Off-road vehicle usage: Installation Commanders or their designee determines if,
   when and where off-road vehicles may be operated on base. In many areas, the operation of
   off-road vehicles is unregulated while other jurisdictions have strict requirements concerning
   age, safety training and vehicle equipment. Generally, some "on-street" safety practices such
   as reflective vests, gloves, headlights and goggles may not apply when operating off road in a
   recreational capacity. However, ensure full compliance with local, state or host nation
   requirements. When necessary, develop additional procedures and guidance locally and
   publish in the installation traffic safety plan or supplement to this instruction. Ensure
   environmental considerations are reviewed prior to designating any off-road vehicle use area.
   4.1.4. (Added-USAFA) USAFA Motor Vehicle Traffic Code (USAFAMVTC). Refer to
   Attachment 2 for the USAFAMVTC.
   4.1.5. (Added-USAFA) Law Enforcement/SF Traffic Stops. When signaled, by either SF
   emergency equipment or hand and arm signals, the driver will pull to the shoulder or median,
   to completely clear the right-of-way.
       4.1.5.1. (Added-USAFA) All occupants of the vehicle will stay in the vehicle until
       directed otherwise by SF.
       4.1.5.2. (Added-USAFA) The driver of the vehicle must be prepared to provide a valid
       driver's license, vehicle registration, proof of insurance, installation access credential, and

       4.1.6.1. (Added-USAFA) All USAFA agencies will coordinate with the TSC before
       changing or altering traffic control devices and signs.
       4.1.6.2. (Added-USAFA) The DFC is not required to give prior public notice before
       erecting barricades to close certain roadways or redirect traffic when prior notice is not
       possible.
   4.1.7. (Added-USAFA) Speed Measuring Devices. Only 10 SFS patrols will utilize Radar
   and Laser based speed-measuring devices on USAFA; no other personnel are authorized to
   use these devices on base. NOTE: As mentioned previously, local law enforcement
   personnel may assist with traffic enforcement and may utilize their agency devices to detect
   violators.
       4.1.7.1. (Added-USAFA) SF members authorized to utilize speed-measuring devices
       must be trained by a certified instructor. The 10th Security Forces Squadron Training
       Section (10 SFS/S3T) is responsible for ensuring a certified instructor is available to
       provide the training. The 10 SFS/S3T will maintain records of certification and training
       conducted.
          4.1.7.1.1. (Added-USAFA) Training is recommended to be conducted by a state
          certified instructor; however, the use of the manufacturer’s training references and
          materials are authorized if taught by 10 SFS/S3T instructors who possess a “T” prefix
          and utilize lesson plans approved by the DFC.
   4.1.8. (Added-USAFA) Private Resale Lot (Lemon Lot). The private resale lot located
   directly south of Building 4560, USAFA Woodcraft Skills Shop, commonly referred to as the
   "Lemon Lot," is intended to provide a consolidated location for USAFA personnel or other
   members of the community to sell their POVs to private individuals.
       4.1.8.1. (Added-USAFA) Prior to using this lot, the owner of the vehicle must obtain a

       the proper permit are subject to towing at the owner's expense, without prior notification.
4.2. Traffic Accident Investigation.
   4.2.1. A major traffic accident is any accident involving a fatality, injury or property damage
   above the amount established by Installation Commanders. Installation Commanders may set
   differing amounts for government versus private vehicle and property damage. Monetary
   damage amounts for major accidents are typically $10,000. The investigation of major
   accidents should be accomplished by a trained accident investigator. MAJCOMs will
   determine the level of training required.
       4.2.1.1. (Added-USAFA) USAFA Accident Classification. The classification of motor
       vehicle accidents is made according to injuries or property damage sustained.
          4.2.1.1.1. (Added-USAFA) Severity of injury. Any injuries sustained or suspected
          by emergency personnel, to include 10 SFS, during a motor vehicle accident
          constitutes a major vehicle accident.

              results in fatal injuries to one or more personnel. A fatal injury is one that results
AFMAN31-116_USAFASUP 13 AUGUST 2012                                                              17


              in death within 12 months of the accident causing the injury.
              4.2.1.1.1.2. (Added-USAFA) Incapacitating injury. An injury, other than fatal,
              that prevents the injured person from walking, driving, or normally continuing the
              activities that he or she was capable of performing before the accident. Examples
              are severe lacerations, broken or distorted limb, skull fracture, crushed chest,
              internal injury, unconsciousness when taken from the accident scene, or inability
              to leave the accident scene without help.
              4.2.1.1.1.3. (Added-USAFA) Non-incapacitating evident injury. An injury,
              other than fatal and incapacitating, that is evident to any person at the scene of the
              accident. Examples are lump on head, abrasions, or minor lacerations.
              4.2.1.1.1.4. (Added-USAFA) Possible injury. An injury reported or claimed
              that is not a fatal, incapacitating, or non-incapacitating evident injury. Examples
              are momentary unconsciousness, claim of injuries that are not evident, limping, or
              complaint of pain, nausea, or hysteria.
          4.2.1.1.2. (Added-USAFA) Severity of vehicle damage.
              4.2.1.1.2.1. (Added-USAFA) Disabling damage. Any damage to a vehicle such
              that it cannot be driven (or towed in the case of trailers) from the scene of the
              accident in the usual manner by daylight after simple repairs, and without further
              damage or hazard to itself, other traffic elements, or the roadway. Any disabling
              damage caused by a motor vehicle accident that prevents the vehicle from being
              safely driven constitutes a major vehicle accident.
              4.2.1.1.2.2. (Added-USAFA) Functional damage. Any non-disabling damage to
              a vehicle that affects operation of the vehicle or its parts. Examples are doors,
              windows, hood, and trunk lids that will not operate properly; broken glass that
              obscures vision; or any damage that could prevent the motor vehicle from passing
              an official motor vehicle inspection.
              4.2.1.1.2.3. (Added-USAFA) Other motor vehicle damage. Any damage to a
              vehicle that is not disabling will be classified as a minor vehicle accident. Such
              damage usually affects only the load on the vehicle or the appearance of the motor
              vehicle. Examples are damage to hubcaps, trim, or grill; glass cracks that do not
              interfere with vision; dents; scratches; body punctures; or damage to load.
   4.2.2. Generally, a detailed accident investigation includes, but is not limited to, an AF Form
   1315, Accident Report, field sketch, scale diagram (if death or serious bodily harm), and
   accident narrative.
4.3. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
   4.3.1. Military members report information to Security Forces if they are on/off base
   resulting in accidents involving injuries or damage to military property. Local guidance will
   capture procedures to accomplish these notifications and the timeframes to report.
   Installation Commanders determine what agencies to notify and for what type of accidents to
   notify them. The DFC must develop a local notification matrix or other procedures to ensure
   proper notification of appropriate base and civilian agencies are conducted. Develop and
   publish these notification procedures locally.
18                                          AFMAN31-116_USAFASUP 13 AUGUST 2012


  4.3.2. Security Forces will act as the focal point for gathering off-base accident information
  of military affiliated personnel. Record the information in the Security Forces blotter, along
  with the associated case number from the investigating police agency. When possible,
  Security Forces Reports and Analysis (S5R) will obtain copies of major accident reports
  prepared by investigating civilian police agencies to accompany off-base accident reporting
  information.
  4.3.3. Security Forces respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents (unless local conditions
  or policies prohibit) to accomplish the following:
     4.3.3.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
     4.3.3.2. Protect personal property.
     4.3.3.3. Normalize traffic.
     4.3.3.4. Identify witnesses and personnel involved.
     4.3.3.5. Conduct a formal investigation.
     4.3.3.6. The DFC (with Installation Commander approval) will develop local response
     and investigative procedures for various types of accidents to include minor vehicle
     accidents. S/He may delegate this authority to on-duty Security Forces supervisory
     personnel.
  4.3.4. Record accident information in the Security Forces blotter. This information should
  include the accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle operator(s), unit (or
  address when civilian not affiliated with military), vehicle description and license
  number(s)/plate. Also, include a brief summary of any damage and circumstances behind or
  causing the accident, as well as any traffic citations issued.
     4.3.4.1. (Added-USAFA) Traffic Accident Investigation Reports. The 10 SFS is
     primarily responsible to conduct vehicle traffic accident investigations on USAFA
     proper.
         4.3.4.1.1. (Added-USAFA) All traffic accidents will be reported to BDOC, at 333-
         2000, as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after the accident. Exception:
         Cold reporting per local authorities.
         4.3.4.1.2. (Added-USAFA) Minor traffic accident investigations will be recorded on
         a USAFA Form 625, Minor Accident Worksheet, and a copy will be provided to the
         drivers upon completion of the report. Fault may also be determined and a citation
         may be issued by SF.
         4.3.4.1.3. (Added-USAFA) Requests for information can be obtained from
         10 SFS/S5R and will be released according to the Privacy Act and the Freedom of
         Information Act.
  4.3.5. Investigation conducted by Security Forces and/or AFOSI of any traffic accident will
  take precedence over any other types of investigations relating to the accident. This
  precludes the loss of any potential evidence that may later have to be introduced in any
  criminal/judicial proceedings. (Example: Any safety related investigation and/or any other
  investigation that may hamper accident investigation practices by Security Forces and/or
  AFOSI.)
AFMAN31-116_USAFASUP 13 AUGUST 2012                                                       19

         government vehicles will be conducted in cooperation with the civilian law
         enforcement agency. Typically, statements will be accomplished by driver(s),
         witness(s), and victim(s), if applicable. A Standard Form 91, Motor Vehicle Accident
         Report, and a Standard Form 94, Statement of Witness, will also be accomplished.
         These forms will be coordinated through unit Vehicle Control Officers/NCOs and
         forwarded to the 10th Logistics Readiness Squadron, Vehicle Operations
         (10 LRS/LGRDDO) (333-2204).
  4.3.6. (Added-USAFA) Accident Reporting. The driver of a vehicle involved in or witness
  to an accident will stop immediately, as close to the scene as possible without obstructing
  traffic and render first aid as necessary.
     4.3.6.1. (Added-USAFA) Individuals are only required to render first aid measures for
     which they are properly trained; however, at a minimum, they will immediately seek
     medical assistance as needed.
     4.3.6.2. (Added-USAFA) Report the accident to the Base Defense Operations Center
     (BDOC) at 333-2000; personnel will provide name, address, location of the accident, and

          4.3.6.5.2. (Added-USAFA) POVs involved in traffic accidents that result in serious
          injuries or fatalities shall be towed by a tow company to the impound lot, if requested
          by the on-the-scene traffic accident investigator. The vehicle may be needed for
          further investigation or as evidence.
          4.3.6.5.3. (Added-USAFA) Inoperable military/government vehicles involved in
          traffic accidents will be removed from the scene by a military/government tow
          company or approved contracted tow company coordinated through
          10 LRS/LGRDDO.
4.4. Parking.
   4.4.1. Reserved Parking. When not addressed by MAJCOMs, Installation Commanders
   determine reserved parking guidance for their installations. Number of available spaces,
   facility design and layout, traffic flow and number of vehicles using facilities will help
   determine the number and location of reserved parking spaces. Make guidance and
   procedures governing reserved parking a part of the installation supplement to this
   instruction, separate traffic control instruction or installation-parking plan. The publication
   must address approval, issue, control and review of reserved parking and should give special
   consideration to bicycle, motorcycle, visitor and car pool parking. Consideration should also
   be given to labor and management contracts when designating parking. Handicap parking is
   regulated under the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards and applies to all Air Force
   installations.
      4.4.1.1. (Added-USAFA) Reserved parking slots are monitored, coordinated, and
      approved IAW 10 ABW/CC reserved parking space policy. All requests for reserved
      parking slots should be formally requested using the AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer
      Work Request. The request is then forwarded to the appropriate building manager for
      approval or disapproval, based on the standards set by 10 ABW/CC. Upon approval by
      the building manager, the request will be signed by the unit commander and forwarded to
AFMAN31-116_USAFASUP 13 AUGUST 2012                                                         21


     the 10th Civil Engineer Squadron, Production Control (10 CES/CEOP) who will in turn
     submit the request to the TSC for final approval. Once the reserved parking slots are
     approved, it will be the responsibility of the unit’s parking wardens to monitor these
     parking slots.
  4.4.2. Use distinctive emblems, decals, stickers, etc, to control parking space assignments
  and to indicate authorized use of the parking slot. MAJCOMs (or Installation Commanders if
  not addressed by the MAJCOM) may develop guidance concerning the issue and control of
  the identification media discussed above. Designation of parking spaces by name, grade, rank
  or title should be avoided due to force protection concerns.
  4.4.3. Installations may create a parking wardens program to monitor and cite parking
  violators at their facilities.
     4.4.3.1. If utilized, installations will develop a local publication to
     supplement/implement this instruction addressing the parking warden program. The
     supplement will include a requirement for individual unit commanders to delegate a
     minimum of one primary and alternate at the grade of E-5 or above, in writing. All
     monitors will issue parking tickets on the DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket.
     S5R will obtain a letter with the current monitors and maintain the letter on file.
     4.4.3.2. Monitors will be trained by the Security Forces unit on the correct procedures to
     complete tickets, including the routing process of issued tickets to S5R. The main
     difference between a DD Form 1408 issued by a Security Forces member and one by a
     parking monitor is the special instructions on the back of the pink copy that directs the
     violator to contact the monitor within 24 hours or next duty day who issued the ticket
     instead of Security Forces. Monitors will provide contact information on parking tickets
     to enable violators to provide information necessary to complete the citation.
     4.4.3.3. (Added-USAFA) USAFA Parking Warden Program. Units may use parking
     wardens (unit personnel) or facility managers to monitor and cite parking violators,
     especially within off-street parking facilities. Parking wardens will be provided books of
     DD Forms 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Tickets, and will be trained by 10 SFS/S5R on the
     correct procedures to complete the tickets. Parking wardens will only issue citations for
     parking (non-moving) violations.
         4.4.3.3.1. (Added-USAFA) Individual unit commanders will delegate parking
         wardens, in writing, for participation in the Parking Warden Program. The
         10 SFS/S5R will obtain a letter with the current parking wardens and maintain the
         letter on file. The letter will specify minimum of one primary and alternate.
         4.4.3.3.2. (Added-USAFA) All parking wardens will issue parking tickets on the
         DD Form 1408. SF are the only personnel authorized to issue CVB Form 1805,
         Violation Notice, United States District Court.
         4.4.3.3.3. (Added-USAFA) Parking wardens must include special instructions on
         the back of the pink copy directing the violator to contact the parking warden who
         issued the ticket. The parking warden must include how and where they can be
         reached by the violators so they can provide the parking warden with the necessary
         information to complete the citation.

           4.4.3.3.4. (Added-USAFA) Cadet Area.         Cadets may be designated as parking
           wardens for the cadet area.
              4.4.3.3.4.1. (Added-USAFA) The Commandant of Cadets will issue
              AFCW Form 10, Report of Conduct, for all cadet-parking violations. Cadet
              parking violations documented on AFCW Form 10 will be processed and
              administrative action taken IAW AFCWMAN 36-3501.
              4.4.3.3.4.2. (Added-USAFA) All other active duty, civil service, contractor, and
              visitor parking violations will be cited via DD Form 1408 and forwarded to 10
              SFS/S5R after completion by the parking warden as directed in AFMAN 31-
              201, V7.
   4.4.4. (Added-USAFA) Refer to Attachment 3 for the USAFA Parking Plan.
4.5. Off-installation Traffic Activities. The DFC must develop procedures for the sharing and
exchanging of information with civil authorities. Local procedures must cover the receiving,
processing and securing of traffic and related incident reports received from other investigative
agencies. Unit commanders will be notified when personnel under their authority are involved in
serious off-base incidents (i.e., major accidents, DUI, hit and run, etc).
   4.5.1. (Added-USAFA) The DFC has established Memorandum of Agreement
   (MOA)/Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) with local law enforcement agencies to
   ensure the prompt exchange of information.
       4.5.1.1. (Added-USAFA) All military personnel who are cited or apprehended by civil
       law enforcement authorities are required, as soon as possible or after release from the
       hospital, jail, etc., to notify their commanders, AOCs, or first sergeant, who, in turn,
       notify BDOC. The BDOC will complete a detailed blotter entry with pertinent
       information for serious cases only (cases involving the subject being charged with an
       offense, excluding minor traffic infractions). The 10 SFS/S5R will follow the case
       through the civilian courts and accomplish supplemental reports until the case is closed.
       Once the case is closed, 10 SFS/S5R will complete a final report and forward to the
       applicable commander or AOC for appropriate action.

                DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. Use SFMIS to record vehicle traffic accidents, moving and parking
violations, suspension or revocation actions and traffic point assessments involving military and
DoD civilian personnel, their family members and other personnel operating motor vehicles on a
military installation. Use AF Form 1313, Driver Record, when SFMIS is not available. When
filling out the form, use the following codes in the “accident classification” block:
   5.1.1. Identify individuals who are principals in a motor vehicle accident as “Driver 1”
   subject or “Driver 2” victim.
   5.1.2. Identify accidents appropriately with “MVA” minor vehicle accident; (MJVA) major
   vehicle accident; “NLD” no liability determined; “PD” property damage; “PI” personal
   injury; “G” government; “P” private; “V” vehicle; and “FO” fixed object.

      parked another vehicle class instead.
      3. When designated in local parking plan (i.e., double parked, parked in reserved parking,
      against the flow of traffic and those areas designated for emergency vehicles).
      3. ( USAFA) Violations to the USAFA Parking Plan will be assessed points IAW this
      table.
      4. When an AF Form 3545 will also be accomplished. Revocation of driving privileges
      for one year will be considered by the commander. Example: If children or animals were
      left in dangerous conditions in vehicle, i.e., in hot weather where interior temperatures
      may reach dangerous levels, keys left accessible to children or where conditions are
      deemed hazardous by a reasonable person.
      5. Emergency vehicles are authorized to park in any area deemed necessary to affect a
      response.
      5. (USAFA) Table 2.1 addresses violators who are unable to provide proof of insurance
      covering the period of the citation. If the violator is able to provide proof of insurance,
      then points are assessed for driving without proof of insurance.

5.2. Point System Procedures.
   5.2.1. Distribute citation copies and process point assessments IAW AFMAN 31-201,
   Volume 7, Security Forces Reports and Analysis.
   5.2.2. Installation Commanders may suspend or revoke driving privileges as provided by this
   instruction regardless of whether the improvement measures identified in AFI 31-218(I) are
   accomplished.
5.3. Disposition of Driving Records. Follow AFI 33-364, Records Disposition – Procedures
and Responsibilities, to maintain and destroy records of military personnel released from active
duty. Driving records remain active in the case of immediate reenlistment, change of officer
component or military and civilian retirement or when continued access to an installation is
authorized. Retain or destroy according to AFI 33-364 records on civilian personnel who are
terminating on-base employment.
AFMAN31-116_USAFASUP 13 AUGUST 2012                                                              25


5.4. (Added-USAFA) Traffic Citations. When issued any traffic citation, military, civil
service, and NAF personnel operating vehicles on USAFA will report it to the appropriate
commander or supervisor within 24 hours or the next duty day.
   5.4.1. (Added-USAFA) Family members of military sponsors receiving a citation on
   USAFA should immediately inform their sponsors who, in turn, will report it to their
   commander or supervisor within 24 hours or the next duty day.
   5.4.2. (Added-USAFA) Civilians who do not fall under a military commander (i.e.,
   contractors) will follow the procedures set forth by their company’s owner, president, or
   foreman.
5.5. (Added-USAFA) Traffic Complaint System. Personnel operating motor vehicles on
USAFA may feel the need to make a complaint about a fellow driver (i.e., unsafe actions,
following too closely, speed, unsafe lane changes, etc.).
   5.5.1. (Added-USAFA) Drivers witnessing “unsafe behaviors” while operating a motor
   vehicle on USAFA are urged to pull over to the side of the road or wait until they are at their
   destination to call BDOC at 719-333-2000. A patrol will be dispatched to attempt to locate
   the unsafe subject driver to preserve safety and law and order.
   5.5.2. (Added-USAFA) Complainants will provide the following information to BDOC:
   make, model, license plate number/state, color of vehicle, description of driver (i.e., white
   male, juvenile, blond hair) location/direction of travel, and a description of violation
   observed.
   5.5.3. (Added-USAFA) The BDOC will obtain all pertinent information (above) from the
   complainant and determine if the complainant would like to file an official complaint by
   completing an AF Form 1168, Statement of Witness, Suspect, or Complainant. NOTE:
   Without an official complaint, no further action will be taken.
   5.5.4. (Added-USAFA) If an official complaint is desired, BDOC will instruct the
   complainant to report to Alternate BDOC, Building 8024, to complete an AF Form 1168.
   Upon receipt of an official complaint, if manpower permits, BDOC will dispatch a patrol to
   make contact with subject vehicle and temporarily detain.
   5.5.5. (Added-USAFA) If the patrolman witnesses the violation, then the patrolman can
   issue a citation to the subject driver; however, if the patrolman does not witness the violation,
   the subject driver will receive a “warning” DD Form 1408 from the patrolman with the same
   instructions for reporting as any DD Form 1408. The subject driver should be provided the
   opportunity to complete an AF Form 1168.
   5.5.6. (Added-USAFA) If no rebuttal is received, the driver is entered into SFMIS and
   points are assessed; however, no points are assessed for warning citations. This entry serves
   as an official record of driving history.
   5.5.7. (Added-USAFA) If the vehicle is unable to be stopped, a check through the Colorado
   Crime Information System (CCIS) may reveal the name/address of the registered owner. The
   DD Form 1408 and Memorandum for Record (MFR) completed by the patrolman will be
   sent certified mail to the address and the ticket will be for the name of the primary registered
   owner as it appears on the CCIS transmission.
 26                                          AFMAN31-116_USAFASUP 13 AUGUST 2012


      5.5.7.1. (Added-USAFA) It should be understood, drivers other than the vehicle owner
      could have been driving the vehicle at the time of the infraction. Ensure the MFR
      includes the following statement, “These allegations can be rebutted, to the 10 SFS/S5R
      offices within 5 duty days of receipt.”
5.6. (Added-USAFA) USAFA-Specific Procedures.
   5.6.1. (Added-USAFA) The 10 SFS/S5R will process violations on visiting military or
   DoD civilians and forward the DD Form 1408 or AF Form 3545, Incident Report, to the law
   enforcement authority at the individual’s base of assignment.
   5.6.2. (Added-USAFA) Commanders and AOCs will establish procedures to ensure
   medical evaluation referrals when members of their unit, based on reasonable belief, appear
   to have mental or physical limits that had, or may have, an adverse effect on driving ability.
5.7. (Added-USAFA) Traffic Violation Reports.
   5.7.1. (Added-USAFA) The 10 SFS/S5R will forward traffic citations, accident reports, and
   incident or complaint reports involving traffic and parking offenses to the appropriate
   military or civilian commander for corrective action.
   5.7.2. (Added-USAFA) The 10 SFS/S5R will transmit copies of tickets and incidents
   electronically to the commander for action. The SFMIS Reports will be digitally signed and
   returned by the commander to complete and close the file. If a unit commander or AOC
   cannot complete the action within the established suspense, they must request an extension in
   writing via e-mail to 10SFS.S5R@US.AF.MIL.
   5.7.3. (Added-USAFA) For moving violations which involve a formal appeal by the
   violator (USAFA Form 28), the unit commander or AOC will maintain the electronic copy of
   the citation or report until final reports of action of the appeal have been forwarded.

                                            Chapter 6

                     IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. Standards for Impoundment. The on-duty SF Flight Chief, or above, will determine
when the vehicle will be driven or moved without owner’s consent if the owner cannot be
contacted or the owner refuses and conditions in AFI 31-218(I) are present.
6.2. Procedures for Impoundment. At times, civilian law enforcement or civilian government
agencies will request the Air Force impound an on-base vehicle for reasons not related to
military issues. Staff such requests through the SJA and DFC. When appropriate, comply and
support such requests and impound the vehicle for a reasonable period. Release the vehicle if
civil authorities do not take custody of the vehicle within a reasonable period as determined by
Installation Commanders.
6.3. Disposition of Vehicles After Impoundment. Impoundment and disposition of privately
owned vehicles is a high-risk process. It is imperative an installation have a detailed plan to:
Ensure wide publicity of base impoundment rules; have a process to provide reasonable notice of
impoundment and an opportunity to reclaim a vehicle; conduct a review of proposed disposal by
appropriate base offices, to include the SJA, prior to taking action; and a process to obtain retail
records of these actions in the event of litigation or high-level inquiry. Further information on
impoundment can be found in AFI 31-218(I).

The intent need not coincide with the act of leaving. It is further defined as any vehicle found on
an installation whose owner: has departed from the military, has a Permanent Change of Station
(PCS), separates, or similar situations. Additionally, personnel who do not respond to traffic
tickets or abandoned vehicle notices placed on the vehicle, or when SF have reasonable grounds
to believe a vehicle has been abandoned, i.e., flat tires, expired registration, missing parts, etc.,
will be considered abandoned.
(Added) (USAFA) Bicycles—Only those devices propelled by human power, having not more
than three wheels, and upon which a person may ride having two tandem wheels either of which
is more than 14 inches in diameter.
(Added) (USAFA) Container—Any object used to hold or carry a beverage; includes but is not

            backpack is authorized if it has high visibility colors/high visibility reflective
            properties or does not obscure the high visibility and reflectivity of the rider’s
            upper garment. Backpacks alone, even if they have bright colors (daytime) and
            reflective material (nighttime), do not satisfy these requirements. Upper outer
            garments shall be clearly visible at all times.
            A2.1.3.9.4.5. (USAFA) Footwear. Riders will wear sturdy over-the-ankle
            footwear that affords protection for the feet and ankles. Durable athletic shoes
            that cover the ankle may be worn. Sandals, low quarter sneakers, and similar
            footwear are not authorized.
     A2.1.3.10. (USAFA) Commercial or recreational off-road vehicles are not authorized to
     be operated on USAFA. Government Off Road Vehicles (this includes Government

     include operation in traffic, industrial, or pedestrian environments when deemed mission-
     essential and only for official purposes. In all cases, owning/operating units must also
     ensure they comply with requirements identified in AFI 91-207.
     A2.1.3.11. (USAFA) Drivers of all government owned vehicles will not back up unless
     it can be done safely and without interfering with other traffic. A vehicle spotter will be
     used during backing operations. If a spotter is not available, the driver will check behind

 NOTE: Cadets are not authorized to park in any of the identified lots above to include the
 Visitor Center without a valid parking pass. *Cadets may park in the Cadet Field House
 Lower East Lot. For intercollegiate events, USAFA/AD and USAFA/CW will develop and
 approve a parking plan at the beginning of the intercollegiate season designating
 approved parking areas for intercollegiate fans and auxiliary parking for cadet vehicles.
 In order to accommodate parking for events held at the Cadet Field House, USAFA/AD
 will require special assistance from USAFA/CW. USAFA/CW will help ensure all cadet
 and staff vehicles parked in the Cadet Field House Lot, Cadet Field House Upper East
 and Lower East Lots, Upper Firstie and the Reservoir parking lots are moved no later than
 3 hours prior to the event start time. Vehicles removed from these lots will be allowed to
 park in the Varsity Soccer Lot and around the Cadet Athletic Fields as available.
 USAFA/AD will provide USAFA/CW with a schedule and updates of Cadet Field House
 events that will require implementation of this instruction.
   A3.2.6. (USAFA) Parking is very limited in the cadet area. POVs with an AOC/AMT
   parking sticker will park in their reserved slots throughout the cadet area. Reserved handicap
   parking slots will be for those individuals who have a handicap state-issued license plate or
   placard visibly displayed. Vehicles parking within 25 meters of facilities for mission reasons
   will have a close-in pass visibly displayed on the driver’s side dashboard. The USAFA
   senior leader vehicles are exempt from this requirement.
   A3.2.7. (USAFA) Parking Under Fairchild Hall/Annex: Because of the limited parking in
   the cadet area, vehicle parking under Fairchild Hall/Annex is a necessity to accomplish the
   USAFA mission. Based on the additional risk of parking under buildings, vehicles
   authorized to park under Fairchild Hall/Annex will display a parking pass from their rear
   view mirror issued by USAFA/DF or USAFA/CW. Personnel authorized to park in these
   locations are authorized to have their proximity card coded for entry through the proximity
   gates leading into the underground parking. USAFA/DF and USAFA/CW will maintain a
   strict accountability of all passes issued and notify BDOC of any passes by pass number
   discovered missing or lost so it may be confiscated at the cadet ECPs.
   A3.2.8. (USAFA) During non-duty hours, parking under Fairchild Hall/Annex between
   1800 and 0600 is authorized without the additional pass.
   A3.2.9. (USAFA) Motorcycle parking is authorized in designated motorcycle parking areas
   or parking slots based on the procedures identified in paragraphs above. If parking slots are
   used, personnel riding motorcycles should share the slot as much as possible because of the
   limited parking. Members authorized to park under Fairchild Hall/Annex who ride
   motorcycles are not required to display the additional USAFA/DF or USAFA/CW pass. This
   is based on the increased possibility of the pass being lost or stolen.
A3.3. (USAFA) Boats, Trailers, and Recreational Vehicles. Boats, trailers, and recreational
vehicles must be registered with Outdoor Recreation (ODR) before the vehicle can be authorized
for storage on USAFA. Authorized storage of these types of vehicles is restricted to the ODR

storage facility within the fenced area located on the northwest and southwest corner of Park and
Security Drive.
   A3.3.1. (USAFA) Parking is prohibited for boats, boat trailers, horse trailers and utility
   trailers, recreation vehicles designated for sleeping, within cluster areas when they create a
   safety hazard, when they interfere with other cluster residents' parking spaces, or when the
   vehicle is not properly registered. Vehicles may be parked in housing areas for a period of
   24 hours to load, unload, or clean only. For privatized housing RV parking policy, please
   refer to the Community Handbook located at www.usafaliving.com.
   A3.3.2. (USAFA) Parking anywhere on USAFA for the purpose of camping is prohibited
   outside of approved camping areas.
A3.4. (USAFA) No Parking Areas. When vehicles are found in a no parking area and appear
to be abandoned, BDOC is notified. An authorized towing agency is contacted and the vehicle is
placed in an impoundment area at the owner’s expense. No parking areas are as follows:
   A3.4.1. (USAFA) On any seeded or grassed area not specifically designated for parking.
   A3.4.2. (USAFA) Within loading docks, to include bus-loading docks except during
   specified loading and unloading operations.
   A3.4.3. (USAFA) Within 75 feet of an accident or fire equipment, which is stopped in
   response to an alarm.
   A3.4.4. (USAFA) In any area where the vehicle exceeds the allotted parking time.
A3.5. (USAFA) Dormitories. Parking at the airmen dormitories (Intrepid, Atlantis, and
Challenger Halls) on the sidewalk adjacent to entry points is permissible only for short-term
unloading of vehicles. Vehicles will not be parked for longer than 20 minutes for loading and
unloading. Vehicle parking is not authorized for non-Airmen dormitory residents in the west
parking lot of Intrepid Hall (Parking lot to the south of the Community Center Gymnasium).
