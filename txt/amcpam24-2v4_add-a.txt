This pamphlet series is intended as a load planning guide and provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners (both long range and individual
movement) to load plan aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Equipment and methods
listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed. It must be noted that,
unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary widely,
even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval, therefore, ultimately rests with the
individual contractor providing airlift services to the DOD. This pamphlet series enables
application of DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation – Part III Mobility, Appendix
V, Aircraft Load Planning and Documentation; as well as AMCI 10-402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet
(CRAF). The guidance contained herein is applicable to all USAF, AFRC, ANG and DOD
agencies whenever they are charged with using the CRAF assets contained herein, in accordance
with DOD, inter-service, and/or MAJCOM agreements.

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This pamphlet series is non-directive in nature. It provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners to more efficiently and effectively
load plan aircraft in the CRAF.

1.2. Scope. CRAF aircraft specifications listed herein are current as of the date of this printing.
Equipment and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed.
It must be noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not
standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval,
therefore, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DOD.
1.2.1. Volume 4, Boeing (McDonnell Douglas). AMCPAM 24-2 Volume 4 deals specifically
with aircraft originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Corporation. McDonnell Douglas
Corp. first formed in 1967 after the Douglas Co. (founded 1920) and McDonnell Aircraft Corp.
(originating in 1928) merged. Through the last merger into the Boeing Company in 1997, the
Boeing Company has melded the companies founded by aerospace pioneers William Boeing,
Donald Douglas, James McDonnell, James "Dutch" Kindelberger, and Howard Hughes Jr. As of
the date of this publication, the Boeing Company has produced almost 17,000 commercial jet
aircraft alone, with over 12,100 still in service.

1.3. Arrangement. This pamphlet series is designed for easy reference and access to the most
commonly needed information for planning purposes. Essentially, Volume 1 will contain all
information common to the entire CRAF program and most, if not all, carriers. Volumes 2
through 5 will contain information specific to a particular manufacturer’s airframes, with each
sub-volume addendum addressing a different series or type. Each can be referenced separately
from another; however, each addendum needs to be used in conjunction with Volume 1.
1.3.1. Volume 4, Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) Addenda. Volume 4 is not separated from each
subsequent addendum, but is published as a “cover” document along with and as an introduction
for each addendum. The same information for Volume 4 essentially gets republished--unchanged
with each Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) model’s addendum.
1.3.2. Volume 4, Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) Quick Reference Tables. All chapter
descriptions for various models are designed to be used in conjunction with Chapter 2 Quick
Reference Tables. The information in the Quick Reference Tables will generally not be restated
in the expanded chapters as they are meant primarily for pictorial figures.

1.4. Supplements. Changes or supplements to this pamphlet by agencies, other than AMC, are
prohibited. This does not preclude its use as a reference document for preparation of intra-
agency instructional directives.

1.5. Acronyms. An explanation of the acronyms used in this pamphlet is in AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 1, Attachment 1.

1.7. Description. Addendum A. Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) DC-8 Series.
The DC-8 Series aircraft are narrow body, four engine aircraft, originally designed for medium
range. The DC-8 was one of the earliest jet-powered commercial aircraft, and the first
commercial jet for the Douglas Co. It was first developed in early fifties, and the first DC-8 flew
in 1958. Despite initially not wanting to change the fuselage size in the earlier -10 through -50
models, the later "Super 60 Series" did increase size, capacity, as well as efficiency. The follow-
on "Series 70" versions also gave the DC-8 series longer range due to the newer, more fuel-
efficient turbofan engines. These innovations, combined with the DC-8's reputation for service
reliability, operational convenience and passenger comfort, may explain why almost 100 are still
in service 38 years after the last of 556 was made.

The DC-8 had seven sub-series manufactured during its lifetime, numbered in tens.

Series 10. The first in the series, the Series 10 included the DC-8-11 and the DC-8-12. The DC-
8-11 was type-certified in August 1959.
Series 20. The only model in the series, the DC-8-21 received type-certification on January
1960. All of the Series 10's were re-engined and converted to Series 20 aircraft.
Series 30. Models in this series included the DC-8-31, DC-8-32 (which was the first to be type-
certified in February 1960), and the DC-8-33.
Series 40 models include the DC-8-41, type-certified in March 1960, the DC-8-42 and DC-8-43.
Series 50 models are the DC-8-51, DC-8-52 (the first type-certified in April 1961), the DC-8-53,
DC-8-54, and the DC-8-55.

Series 60 or "Super 60's" offered the first variations other than engine upgrades. Making
standard use of turbofan engines (versus turbojets) and stretching the fuselage realized range and
capacity increases. The DC-8-61 (type-certified September 1966) and corresponding freighter
version, the DC-8-61F (type-certified June 1967) was stretched almost 37 feet longer than
previous versions. The DC-8-62 (type-certified April 1967) and its freighter, the DC-8-62F
(type-certified October 1967), in contrast was stretched only about 7 feet from the original length
of 150.7 feet, but more powerful engines. The DC-8-63 (type-certified June 1967) and the DC-8-
63F (type-certified June 1968) mixed the longer fuselage of the -61 with engines of the -63.

Series 70 or "Super 70's" models are basically re-engined versions of the Series 60 DC-8's. The
DC-8-71 and DC-8-71F were both type-certified in April 1982. The DC-8-73 and the DC-8-73F
AMCPAM24-2V4_ADD-A            17 NOVEMBER 2011                                           7


were both type-certified in June 1982. Finally, the DC-8-72 and the DC-8-72F were both type-
certified in September 1982. All are capable of long-range routes.

DC-8's are unique in having two doors for each forward and aft cargo compartment.
Since most of the remaining DC-8's operating are now freighters, or have been converted into
freighters/combi. This volume only discusses the freighter variants of the "Super 60's & 70's".

AMCPAM 24-2, Volume 4, Addendum A will focus primarily on the:
DC8-61F                                     DC8-71F
DC8-62F                                     DC8-72F

                               QUICK REFERENCE TABLES

2.1. Ranges. Most numbers are shown as a range, due to representing all-passenger to all-freight
versions OR due to different modifications within a series/type. Also, within a series, several
different engines/weight classes may exist.

2.2. Pallets. Unless otherwise noted, pallet information is based on the civilian pallet IATA code
PAG- / P1P- type LD7 which measures 88" × 125".

2.3. Table Legends.
2.3.1. Compartments. Unless otherwise noted, compartments are: M=Main/Upper;
F=Forward/Lower Lobe; A=Aft/Lower Lobe; B=Bulk/Lower Lobe.

2.3.2. “X”. An “X” represents the information does NOT apply for that series/type (ex: an all-
passenger version would have an “X” by Main Compartment Door)

2.3.3. Question Mark “?”. A “?” represents that the information should apply, but no
information exists in the manufacturer’s technical manuals.

2.3.4. Exclamation Point “!”. An “!” represents information that should apply, but has been
derived from a reliable, but non-manufacturer source.

2.4. After-Market Conversions. As a reminder, individual airlines may have converted an
airframe apart from the manufacturer’s original specifications. These tables and the charts in the
following chapters do not account for this.

2.5. Tables. The following tables (Tables 2.1 through 2.6) will vary with each AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 4 Addendum.

                                    1) Shows inside dimensions where cargo compartment has a constant cross-section (internal contour measured perpendicular to the
                                       aircraft length - excludes any tapered section of the fuselage).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    MAIN COMPARTMENT CONTOUR CHART DC-8 RIGHT




                                    2) Minimum 2 inches of clearance must exist between aircraft contour and maximum payload contour (represented by inner solid line of
                                       the contour drawing).
                                    3) All horizontal dimensions are measured left or right of aircraft centerline (CL).
