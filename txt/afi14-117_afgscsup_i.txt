       training to conduct their responsibilities.
          1.6.1.4.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) BW SIO will ensure appropriate number of
          target intelligence personnel have the capability to verify/quality check
          supported OPLAN JDPIs.             Level of detail for verification includes:
          confirming the target matches the description and ensuring there are no
          noticeable errors when plotting the x, y, and z axis (e.g. the JDPI description
          states ―NW corner of building‖ but plots to the SE corner of another building
          in another part of the facility). Questions concerning JDPIs should be referred
          to the supported COCOM‘s Air Component after coordinating with the local
          mission planning cell (MPC) Chief. At least one POC should have completed
          the Common Geospatial Service (CGS) course so they can instruct other
          personnel on how to verify JDPIs. While the CGS Initial Qualification
          Training (IQT) Course and 20 AFTC CDE Course conducted by the 20 IS at
          Offutt AFB, NE currently meets these requirements, coordinate with
          AFGSC/A2XF for information on satisfying these training needs.
          1.6.1.4.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) BW SIO will ensure appropriate number of
          target intelligence personnel have the capability to verify CDE supported
          OPLAN target requirements. Verifying CDE requires the personnel to do a
          final crosscheck of the JDPI comparing the listed CDE materials against the
          fragged weapon. Because collateral damage methodology (CDM) can differ
AFI14-117_AFGSCSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2011                                                     13


             for each COCOM, questions concerning CDE should be referred to the
             supported COCOM's J2 Targets function and/or the Air Component Targets
             function for resolution or adjudication. Additionally, during contingency
             operations, wing intelligence personnel will elevate CDE concerns or
             discrepancies to higher headquarters agencies (COCOMs, AOCs, etc.)
             through their respective chain of command. At least one POC should have
             completed CDE training so they can instruct other personnel on how to do a
             final crosscheck of the COCOM CDE. The CGS IQT Course and 20 AFTC
             CDE Course conducted by the 20 IS at Offutt AFB, NE currently meets these
             requirements, coordinate with AFGSC/A2XF for information on satisfying
             these training needs.
             1.6.1.4.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) The SIO at each flying wing is responsible for
             programming and planning, requesting and allocating training courses for
             these individuals. SIOs will identify any training requirements or shortfalls in
             capability to AFGSC/A2XF and AFGSC/A2XS. AFGSC/A2X will endeavor
             to support SIO training requirements. Computer based training (CBT) on the
             CJCSI 3160.01 CDE methodology is available for basic awareness and to
             provide a tool to assist with CDE familiarization training. Coordinate with
             AFGSC/A2XS for information on this CBT.
          1.6.1.4.3. (Added-AFGSC) Identify target intelligence tasks, metrics, gaps, and
          solutions to AFGSC/A2X for integration into the AFGSC and AF CP&A,
          programming, integration into OPLAN re-writes and potential funding.
          1.6.1.4.4. (Added-AFGSC) Identify       targeting    systems    requirements     to
          AFGSC/A2O.
          1.6.1.4.5. (Added-AFGSC) Identify JMEM requirements to support OPLAN or
          Organize, Train and Equip (OTE) taskings for bombers and other AFGSC
          conventional force applications to AFGSC/A2X.
          1.6.1.4.6. (Added-AFGSC) Using Attachment 2, Conventional Combat
          Mission Folder (CMF) Targets Materials (TM) (Electronic Target Folder)
          Checklist, as a minimum, compile target materials from Joint Targeting Toolbox
          (JTT) or COCOM approved sources and maintain the intelligence and targeting
          portions of the CMF for all OPLAN taskings that have a pre-Air Tasking Order
          (ATO) per the supported COCOM's direction and AFGSC/A2 guidance.
          Attachment 3, CMF Target Folder Process Flowchart, diagrams the process
          outlined in Attachment 2. Review and update these mission materials annually
          or within four (4) months of the publishing of new air tasking (waiverable upon
          written request to AFGSC/A2O). Attendance in the supported COCOM's ATO
          planning conferences is recommended for the AFGSC/A2 staff, NAF staff, and/or
          BWs‘ SIOs, if funding is available
          1.6.1.4.7. (Added-AFGSC) Execute targeting functions per taskings by the
          COCOM's Air Components' ATO, Special Instructions, and Rules of
          Engagement. See Attachment 4, Air Tasking Order/Joint Desired Point of
          Impact (ATO/JDPI) Checklist, for the ATO/JDPI break out checklist. Deviations
          in JDPI, weaponeering, and collateral damage estimates are not authorized. If

     through verification an error is identified, these errors will be coordinated with the
     local MPC and then the COCOM's Air Component and require formal notification
     of change. "BEST" weaponeering tasking for fixed facilities is never desired due
     to the unit‗s lack of understanding of that specific target's desired effect (not to be
     confused with the overall objective), lack of access to COCOM's intelligence
     resources to properly characterize the target, units not certified to drop JDPIs or
     conduct CDE and lack of time that must be focused on primary unit level
     responsibilities. If an ATO tasks "BEST" weaponeering, contact COCOM Air
     Component‘s targeting function to acquire the weaponeering solution or specific
     guidance in writing from the COCOM‘s Air Component authorizing the unit to do
     the weaponeering with the understanding the unit is not certified in CDE or
     dropping JDPIs.
     1.6.1.4.8. (Added-AFGSC) Due to the level of effort required to build an ATO,
     Combatant Commands may develop a pre-ATO as an on-the-shelf option to
     support an OPLAN. During peacetime and upon receipt of a pre-ATO that
     supports a Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP) OPLAN the following will be
     conducted:
        1.6.1.4.8.1. (Added-AFGSC) Obtain JIPTL and pre-ATO via official
        message traffic, JTT, COCOM‘s Air Component‘s specified website, or other
        means. Pre-ATO may be received in the following formats: official message
        traffic, JTT, or COCOM‗s Air Components specified website or other means.
        1.6.1.4.8.2. (Added-AFGSC) Sort JIPTL or ATO in JTT for tasked
        missions.
        1.6.1.4.8.3. (Added-AFGSC) Identify COCOM Core Target Material
        (CTM) and COCOM Air Component executable Target Materials (TM) for
        each tasked target.
        1.6.1.4.8.4. (Added-AFGSC) Identify materials for CMF production, which
        may include the following: Facility Outline Graphic (FOG), Collateral
        Damage Graphic (CDG), JDPI, weaponeering, Conventional Air Launch
        Cruise Missile (CALCM) support material, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff
        Missile (JASSM) support material to include Terminal Area Model (TAMs),
        desired targeting effect (JTT JIPTL will provide desired targeting effect), and
        any weapon system-specific target graphic requirements. All materials will
        meet requirements outlined in this instruction, and all nuclear materials will
        meet requirements outlined in Air Force Global Strike Instruction (AFGSCI)

        1.6.2.9. (Added-AFGSC) COCOM CDE Tool. Currently, Joint Automated Deep
        Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) is the predominant tool for COCOM
        CDE, but is not the only CDE tool that can be used. AFGSC/A2O in coordination
        with AFGSC/A2X will ensure proper CDE tool to support the verification (quality
        control) of COCOM CDE.
     1.6.3. (Added-AFGSC) Target Lists
        1.6.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Candidates Target List (CTL). A CTL is a
        consolidated list of selected Target Development Nominations (TDN) submitted to
        the JFC considered to have military significance in the JFC‗s operational area.
        National agencies, the combatant commander‗s (CCDR) staff, joint forces
        subordinate to the CCDR, supporting unified combatant commands, and components
        all submit TDNs to the CCDR for validation and inclusion on the CTL. TDNs are
        submitted by components, other government agencies, and/or multinational partners
        to the JFC targeting staff for inclusion in the JFC‗s CTL. The CTL subsequently
        drives further target development, vetting, validation, and generation of the joint
        target list (JTL), restricted target list, and possible additions to the no-strike list (NSL)
        if Law of Armed Conflict issues emerge.
        1.6.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) Joint Target List (JTL). A JTL is a prioritized list of
        targets developed, vetted, and validated from the CTL. Components select targets
        from the JTL to compile their respective target nomination lists (TNLs) and forward
        them to the CCDR. The TNLs are then combined, validated, and prioritized to form a
        draft JIPTL that is submitted to the joint targeting coordination board (JTCB) for
        finalization.
        1.6.3.3. (Added-AFGSC) Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List (JIPTL). The
        JIPTL is a prioritized list of targets approved and maintained by the JFC. Targets and
        priorities are derived from the recommendations of components and other appropriate
        agencies, in conjunction with their proposed operations supporting the JFC‗s
        objectives and guidance.
        1.6.3.4. (Added-AFGSC) Air Tasking Order (ATO). The ATO is a method used
        to task and disseminate to components, subordinate units, and command and control
        agencies projected sorties, capabilities, and/or forces to targets and specific missions.
        The ATO normally provides specific instructions to include call signs, targets,
        controlling agencies, etc., as well as general instructions.
     1.6.4. (Added-AFGSC) Target Materials (TM). TM are graphic, textual, tabular,
     digital, video or other physical and quantitative presentations of target intelligence.
     These products locate, identify, and describe potential targets with enough accuracy to
     support operations against designated targets by one or more weapon systems. TM are
     also suitable for training, planning, and evaluating such operations.
        1.6.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) Core Target Material (CTM). CTMs are produced by
        the COCOM/J2 and are the foundation for a target‗s characterization. A CTM
        includes the following:
            1.6.4.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Target header information, a textual description,
            location information (geographical or virtual), source data, classification, target

          relationship to the surrounding terrain.
          1.6.4.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) Facility Outline Graphics (FOG).                FOGs are
          designed as the authoritative functional outline and reference point for facilities of
          interest to the targeting community, and will clearly delineate all components of
          the target. Facility reference point data is entered into the Modernized Integrated
          Database (MIDB) Facility Geodetic record.
          1.6.4.1.4. (Added-AFGSC) Collateral Damage Estimate (CDE) Graphics.
          CDE graphics will visually depict areas of collateral damage concern around a
          facility or JDPI. Frequently these graphics support CDE Levels 1 and 2.

          will not be specified in this instruction; they are defined by DIA, Joint Warfare
          Support, Physical Vulnerability Division (JWS-4). With DIA/JWS-4 training and
          guidance, PVA-Gs can be produced by COCOMs and Service/Allied production
          centers.    These graphics are designed to provide the warfighter with
          recommendations that either bound the penetration problem for bunker attacks or
          provide baseline aimpoints and weapon impact conditions/effects for tunnel
          attacks. DIA-produced Hard Target Graphics (HTG) have been replaced by the
          PVA-G plus associated structural/engineering characterization data.

     operational data for crew study. The MPS can include information on weapon
     effects, limitations, and employment; route threat assessments; enemy air order of
     battle information; escape and evasion data; safe areas and overflown country
     briefings; target significance; and Command and Control (C2). Target intelligence
     personnel should be available to assist and support aircrews with additional
     information, materials, maps, charts, and graphics, as required.
        1.6.4.5.1. (Added-AFGSC) Units will produce and maintain intelligence
        products contained in nuclear CMFs per AFGSCI 10-450 series.             For
        conventional or tasked OPLAN targets, intelligence products will be produced
        and maintained IAW this AFGSCSUP. AFGSC/A2X is responsible for defining
        required CMF intelligence product content.
     1.6.4.6. (Added-AFGSC) BW SIO will coordinate with weapons/tactics and wing
     plans personnel to develop unit-specific Geospatial Intelligence and Services (GI&S)
     and target material requirements. Establish procedures to ensure GI&S and target
     materials are current and IAW with AFI 14-205, Geospatial Intelligence and Services
     (GI&S), and the AFGSCSUP. Unit level Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) and
     target materials must be based upon COCOM and/or JFC J2 core materials. If not
     available through the COCOM or JFC, submit a request for production to
     AFGSC/A2O for external production.
     1.6.4.7. (Added-AFGSC) Electronic Target Folder (ETF). ETFs are the primary
     repository for US/Allied Target Analysis Program products. The minimum ETF
     requirements for a specific target will vary IAW Attachment 2 and COCOM
     requirements. All ETFs should contain the Military Targeting Committee approved
     general content categories. As a minimum, ETFs will include target header
     information, a textual description, location information (geographical or virtual),
     source data, classification and release instructions. ETF elements can be expanded to
     meet specific COCOM or system requirements. Additional information, such as that
     contained in former static target materials, shape files and other analytical or source
     documentation, may be used in the ETF.
        1.6.4.7.1. (Added-AFGSC) JTT is the common Department of Defense (DoD)
        standard for production and dissemination of ETFs. Units must ensure that the

2. AF Targeting References and Considerations.
   2.1. Doctrine. Two foundational documents provide the doctrinal underpinnings for
   targeting, describe core processes, and outline planning/execution considerations to
   successfully conduct all aspects of the targeting cycle. They are AFDD 2-1.9, Targeting and
   Joint Publication 3-60, Joint Targeting. All personnel involved in the AF targeting will
   thoroughly read and understand the contents of these two publications. Additionally, CJCSI
   3160.01, No-Strike and The Collateral Damage Estimation Methodology (U); CJCSI
   3505.01, Target Coordinate Mensuration Certification; and CJCSI 3122.06B, Sensitive
   Target Approval Process (U) (classified), are essential references.
   2.2. Organization.
      2.2.1. Principal Coordinating Effort. Targeting requires a wide range of support from the
      National Intelligence Community (IC); as well as, many DoD operational and
      intelligence organizations. The Joint Staff Deputy Directorate for Targeting (J2T) serves
      as a key facilitator among the various targeting service staffs, combatant commands, DoD
      organizations and the IC, to ensure a coordinated approach to this inherently joint
      activity. It most often uses the Military Target Intelligence Management Structure
      (MTIMS), chartered by the DoD Military Intelligence Board (MIB), to do so. Within the
      MTIMS is a senior leadership (O-6) level forum called the MTC, which serves as an
      advisory body to the MIB, combatant commands, services and defense agencies. It
      provides the means to discuss, coordinate, and determine actions needed to resolve target
      intelligence issues related to Doctrine, Organization, Training Materiel, Leadership &
      Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) areas. Representatives from the Joint
      Staff, combatant commands, Services and Allied Partners make up the membership.
      Supporting the MTC are two action-officer level groups, the TIWG and the JTASG. The
      TIWG and JTASG report issue findings and recommendations to the MTC as directed.
      HQ USAF/A2CPA represents the Air Force in this joint forum, but relies heavily on
      experts across the Air Force.
      2.2.2. Additional Targeting Expertise. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), National
      Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), National Security Agency (NSA), National
      Reconnaissance Office (NRO), Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions
      Effectiveness (JTCG/ME), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and Joint Warfare
      Analysis Center (JWAC) all perform missions dedicated to supporting national, theater
      and joint targeting efforts. Additionally, the combatant commands‘ intelligence
AFI14-117_AFGSCSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2011                                                        21


     organizations perform theater-level target production and analysis. Furthermore, each
     service maintains research labs and weapons development organizations that significantly
     influence targeting capabilities and processes. Consult current SIPRNET or JWICS
     organizational web pages for details on their capabilities.
  2.3. Training.
     2.3.1. Targeting AFSC-Awarding/Initial Skills Training. Personnel performing functions
     supporting the targeting cycle require specialized knowledge, skills and in many cases,
     certification beyond their respective AF Specialty Code (AFSC)-awarding training.
     Commanders should send individuals performing targeting functions to one of the
     following formal training courses as part of an individual‘s Initial Qualification Training
     (IQT).
         2.3.1.1. The Basic Targeting Course (BTC), will be available for enlisted pipeline
         and non- ISR personnel. It is part of the enlisted Targeting AFSC technical training
         and is an AFSC- awarding course.
         2.3.1.2. The USAF operates the Combat Targeting Course (CTC) run by the 17th
         Training Wing at Goodfellow AFB and overseen by HQ AETC, to provide initial
         training for targeting-related duties. Personnel attending this course receive in-depth
         training on applicable targeting processes and procedures. The CTC will transition to
         two courses, the Targeting IFTU and Advanced Targeting Course (ATC). The
         Targeting IFTU will be for ISR officers or mid-level enlisted ISR retrainees going to
         or performing targeting duties at a wing or AOC.
         2.3.1.3. Joint Targeting School (JTS). This school is designed to teach the joint
         targeting process (based on JP 3-60). The USAF recommends this course for those
         mid-career ISR Airmen going to a combatant command, Joint Staff, or CSA targeting
         billet; or for those who are unable to attend AF targeting training. USJFCOM
         oversees JTS at its joint training facility in Dam Neck VA.
         2.3.1.4. Weaponeering. Air Force targeting courses, the Conventional Weaponeering
         Fundamentals Mobile Training Team, and JTS teach weaponeering basics as part of
         their curriculum. This training is JTCG/ME-approved and is an essential requirement
         to properly use the JMEM Weaponeering System and Integrated Munitions Effects
         Assessment program for respective targets.
         2.3.1.5. Additional IQT training for personnel may be required beyond BTC, CTC
         (Targeting IFTU), or JTS. IAW AFI 14-202 Vol 1, personnel will also complete the
         IQT program for the weapon systems/mission areas to which they are assigned (e.g.,
         F-15E, F-16, AOC, etc.).
     2.3.2. Targeting-specific Mission Qualification Training (MQT), Continuation Training
     (CT), and Specialized Training. Targeting-related MQT will be conducted at an
     individual‘s specific unit/organization they are assigned to. Targeting-related CT will
     ensure personnel maintain the required proficiency at their assigned qualification level.
     For some specific targeting positions, individuals will also require specialized
     training/certification, either as part of MQT or after completion of their MQT.

         2.3.2.1. Geopositioning. CJCSI 3505.01 requires training and certification of ISR
         Airmen to conduct precise geolocation positioning for unguided and guided
         munitions delivery. Precise Point Positioning Process Certification (4PC) is
         conducted by NGA and/or NGA-accredited organizations. The 20 IS is designated to
         be the primary Air Force accredited organization conducting 4PC certification.
         2.3.2.2. The Advanced Targeting Course (ATC) has been proposed as a follow-on
         course to BTC and the Targeting IFTU. The ATC is intended for officers and enlisted
         personnel in key targeting wing or AOC billets that require in-depth comprehension
         of targeting cycle functions and their integration in the planning process.
     2.3.3. Consult AFI 36-2201V2, Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA)
     website, or the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA/unit training websites/managers for more
     information on training requirements.
  2.4. Materiel.
     2.4.1. Automation. Targeting is an information intensive process. National/theater
     databases containing targeting related reference material have tens of thousands of
     records. It is essential that targeting professionals emphasize the need to continually
     improve the automation of core targeting tasks that preserve the integrity, fidelity and
     pedigree of targeting information. AF targeting automation efforts will have several
     objectives:
         2.4.1.1. Ensure a means to add, update and maintain the databases, and allow
         linkages that tie all parts of the targeting cycle together (e.g. link an objective and
         measure of success to individual weapon aimpoint).
         2.4.1.2. Allow transfer of essential targeting data (e.g. description and precise
         geolocation) with minimal to no human intervention (except to check data accuracy)
         between intelligence, C2 and operations systems to reduce chances of introducing
         errors into the data.
         2.4.1.3. Provide a means to visualize and display target systems and relationships to
         other systems.
         2.4.1.4. Reduce the time needed to accomplish all of the targeting cycle steps.
  2.5. Leadership.
     2.5.1. Targeting is a command function and is inherently joint. It requires commander
     oversight and involvement to ensure proper execution. It is not the exclusive province of
     one type of specialty or division, such as intelligence or operations, but is the blending of
     expertise from many disciplines across the joint force. As an example, targeting-
     proficient personnel are normally found in most Air & Space Operations Center divisions
     vice a single division. Targeting has long been a USAF core competency (AFDD 2-1.9).
     2.5.2. Targeting Community of Practice (CoP). HQ AF/A2CPA maintains a Targeting
     CoP on the AF Portal CoP link. The CoP is a repository of useful unclassified reference
     material covering a range of targeting issues from doctrine review and TTPs to history of
     targeting. This is an essential reference for targeting professionals and provides a unique
     forum to exchange targeting related data. Of note: JS/J2T also maintains extensive
     targeting related information on their SIPRNET and JWICS web pages.

  2.6. Personnel. Upon completion of an AF-approved targeting course, follow-on OJT and
  practical experience in a specified targeting position, personnel become eligible for award of
  a targeting Special Experience Identifier (SEI). Specific guidance for award and retention of
  targeting SEIs are contained in the Enlisted Classification Directory and Officer
  Classification Directory available online at: http://ask.afpc.randolph.af.mil/.
  2.7. Facility. Not used.

                  1.      Annotate imagery for CMF IAW Wing Weapons and
                          Tactics Standards. This may be done using ETF
                          imagery and/or CIB. Imagery annotations normally
                          include:
                  2.      North arrow
                  3.      Mission information (msn#, package number, BE#)
                  4.      JDPI labels
                  5.      Classification label
                  6.      Attack heading (optional)
                  7.      Threat overlay (optional)

Quality control (QC) (varies, but OIC and NCOIC normally conducts these
duties).
         8.       The following is normally QC‘d:
                  1.       Each CMF/mission planning package is normally
                           labeled with a content label; content is checked to
                           ensure all materials are included
                  2.       Within each CMF, the following is normally QC‘d:
                           1.       Weaponeering/JDPI worksheets
                           2.       Labels on all targeting products (mission #,
                                    package #, BE#/Name, JDPI ID #)
                           3.       Imagery annotations
