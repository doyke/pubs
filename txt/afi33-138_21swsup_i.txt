SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2005-01 (Attachment 13) and alters FOA/DRU
reporting directly to the Air Force Network Operations and Security Center (AFNOSC) due to
FOA/DRU NOSC realignment. Mission Support Centers (MSC) will be treated as Network
Control Centers (NCC) for reporting purposes. Multiple tables have been updated to reflect this
conversion. Additional minor administrative corrections were made and office symbols updated.

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Introduction. This instruction prescribes and explains the various processes necessary to
direct action and report status throughout the AFNETOPS hierarchy. Specifically, it details the
steps required to generate, disseminate, acknowledge, implement, track, and report network
compliance and status information using the TCNO. It also introduces and provides guidance for
the use of C4 NOTAMs. The C4 NOTAMs are closely related to TCNOs with the primary
difference being that they are informative in nature and are the primary means for disseminating
network information that does not direct specific action to be taken, or compliance to be tracked.
Incident, vulnerability, and security incident (to include classified message incidents [CMI])
reporting processes, and the processes for managing and reporting service interruptions, both
authorized and unscheduled, are defined.
1.2. Notification and Tracking Hierarchy. All network and computer security professionals
within the tiered AFNETOPS hierarchy perform a subset of the procedures to produce and
manage TCNOs or C4 NOTAMs. Those same individuals perform a variety of tasks in the
various reporting processes described within this instruction. Figure 1.1 provides a simple
illustration of the interrelationships and associated lines of communication among the various
organizations and personnel involved. NOTE: Refer to AFI 33-115, Volume 1, Network
Operations (NETOPS), for a complete explanation of the AFNETOPS hierarchy.

     1. This category applies to those Program Management Offices (PMO)/System Program
     Offices (SPO) that fall under a HQ USAF functional and do not administratively align under
     Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC).
     2. This category applies to those HQ USAF FOA and DRU Network Control Centers (NCC)
     or Mission Support Centers (MSC) that operate and maintain a network. All other
     FOA/DRU tenant units residing on an Air Force base shall comply with the security policy of
     the host base NCC and the supporting NOSC.
1.3. Submitting Notifications and Reports to the Air Force Network Operations and
Security Center (AFNOSC). NOSCs will notify and submit all reports to the AFNOSC
Command and Control Division using the methods listed in Table 1.1. Use Defense Switched
Network (DSN) to make initial verbal reports, followed by full documentation using priority 2,
Enterprise Tracking and Notification Graphical User Interface (eTANG). If eTANG is not
available then use priority 3, and so on, until all methods have been exhausted. Use classified
transmission means when required.

1.4. Operational Reporting. In addition to the reporting requirements listed throughout this
instruction, confirmed network/system intrusions and changes to Information Operations
Condition (INFOCON) require the submission of Operational Event/Incident Report (OPREP-3)
to the servicing command post per AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. Individuals preparing

OPREP-3s should coordinate with the servicing NCC or NOSC before the information is sent to
the command post. The NCC submits report information applicable to the base metropolitan area
network (MAN). The NOSC submits report information applicable to the MAJCOM network.
The AFNOSC will submit report information applicable to the entire Air Force Enterprise
Network (AFEN). Per AFI 10-206, Commander Air Force Forces-Computer Network Operations
(COMAFFOR-CNO) is a required recipient of all computer incident-related OPREP-3s. The
required content for all Communications/Computer Event OPREP-3s is detailed in AFI 10-206.
1.5. Reporting Incidents not Covered by this Instruction. There are a variety of information
system/network incidents that fall under the jurisdiction of other programs for investigation and
reporting purposes. Examples include theft or loss of information system resources; fraud, waste,
and abuse; and copyright violations. Table 1.2 provides reference to the governing publications
for these types of incidents.

                                          Chapter 3

                                  TCNO MANAGEMENT

Section 3A—Introduction

3.1. Purpose.
   3.1.1. Compliance with Air Force TCNOs is mandatory.
   3.1.2. Time Compliance Network Orders (TCNO) are downward-directed operations,
   security, or configuration management-related orders issued by the AFNOSC or NOSCs. The
   TCNO provides a standardized mechanism to issue one ―order‖ to the entire AFNETOPS
   hierarchy, directing how to operate and make changes to the AFEN. The AFNOSC or
   NOSCs generate TCNOs internally or in response to an IAVA to direct the implementation
   of an operational or security vulnerability risk mitigation procedure or fix action (i.e.,
   countermeasure).
      3.1.2.1. (Added-21SW) Upon receipt of each new IAVA, the Peterson CFP will
      establish a Unit Compliance Date (UCD) 11 duty days after the IAVA is published. The
      first 3-duty days will be used for testing by network System Administrators (SAs).
      Following this 3-day testing period, the Peterson CFP will initiate an 8-day timeline of
      daily activities, prior to the UCD, to accomplish the IAVA. If the NOSC suspense is less
      than 11-duty days, the timeline will be compressed, and if possible, the IAVA will still be
      accomplished one duty day prior to the UCD. The following timeline directs daily
      activities for IAVA:
          3.1.2.1.1. (Added-21SW) UCD/Minus 8:          Peterson CFP initiates System
          Management Server (SMS) push (if applicable) and sends E-mail notification to all
          IAO/CSA/CST/SAs. Units not located on Peterson AFB proper will be responsible
          for initiating their own patch deployment and compliance reporting through their
          local CFP.
          3.1.2.1.2. (Added-21SW) UCD/Minus 7:          Local CFPs initiate scan to validate
          effectiveness of SMS push.
          3.1.2.1.3. (Added-21SW) UCD/Minus 6: Local CFPs complete the scan and e-
          mails the results to the IAO/CSA/CST/SAs who begin to verify compliance of
          assigned machines and report compliance (# of machines affected) to the Peterson
          CFP using provided e-mail template.
          3.1.2.1.4. (Added-21SW) UCD/Minus 5: IAO/CSA/CST/SAs continue to patch all
          noncompliant systems and report compliance. All IAO/CSA/CST/SAs must continue
          to report daily until they are 100 percent compliant. CFP notifies squadron
          commander or equivalent unit leader of their organization’s non-compliance status.
          3.1.2.1.5. (Added-21SW) UCD/Minus 4: IAO/CSA/CST/SAs continue to patch all
          noncompliant systems and report compliance. All IAO/CSA/CST/SAs must continue
          to report daily until they are 100 percent compliant.
 18                                                   AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011


          3.1.2.1.6. (Added-21SW) UCD/Minus 3: CFP notifies group commanders or
          equivalent leader of their organizations’ non-compliance status. Local CFP initiates
          scan.
          3.1.2.1.7. (Added-21SW) UCD/Minus 2: Local CFPs completes the scan and e-
          mails the results to the IAO/CSA/CST/SAs.
          3.1.2.1.8. (Added-21SW) UCD/Minus 1: Local CFPs begin the shut-down scan.
          Peterson and GSU CFPs remove all noncompliant systems from the network and
          Peterson CFP reports the IAVA as GREEN (compliant) on the AFNetOps
          Compliance Tracker (ACT).
       3.1.2.2. (Added-21SW) Systems will not be added or returned to the network until all
       required patches are loaded by the IAO/CSA/SAs and verified by the local CFP.
       3.1.2.3. (Added-21SW) All systems identified as servers will be updated IAW the
       Network SA’s weekly maintenance schedule as coordinated with the NOSC. Compliance
       will be reported upon completion.
       3.1.2.4. (Added-21SW) For NOTAMs that are not associated with IAVAs, the same
       process identified in paragraph 3.1.2.1.will be followed.
   3.1.3. The TCNO process is used to inform responsible Air Force agencies of network and
   system vulnerabilities and to direct and track the implementation of countermeasures. This
   chapter defines the TCNO process and provides guidance, procedures, and formats to process
   TCNOs.
   3.1.4. The TCNO replaces the Directive C4 NOTAM, AFCERT Advisories and Advisory
   Compliance Messages. Existing Directive C4 NOTAMs, AFCERT Advisories, and Advisory
   Compliance Messages will remain valid until superceded by a TCNO. Informative,
   Scheduled Event, Unscheduled Event, and Summary C4 NOTAMs will continue to be used
   as identified in Chapter 4.
3.2. Applicability. The processes defined within this chapter apply to the mitigation of
identified vulnerabilities on any Air Force-owned/managed device connected to the AFEN or
other DOD network. Devices, also referred to as ―assets,‖ include workstations, servers,
infrastructure components (e.g., router, switch) and networked peripherals (e.g., network
printers). Embedded computers within weapon systems are excluded from this definition unless
they are directly accessible through the AFEN and thus vulnerable to exploitation.

Section 3B—TCNO Generation Process

3.3. When to Generate a Time Compliance Network Order (TCNO). The AFNOSC or
NOSCs will produce TCNOs under the following conditions:
   3.3.1. The AFNOSC will generate a TCNO to implement an IAVA, or where applicable, a
   JTF-GNO CTO. TCNO timelines are set to ensure downward-directed timelines are met.
   3.3.2. The AFNOSC can generate a TCNO to address IAVBs, TAs, Air Force-identified
   vulnerabilities or to direct other network operations/defense actions. TCNO timelines are set
   based on an internal analysis of the scope of effort necessary for units to achieve compliance
   and the potential impact on planned and ongoing operations.
AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011                                                           19


   3.3.3. NOSCs can generate a TCNO to address MAJCOM-specific vulnerabilities or to
   direct other network operations/defense actions. NOSCs should coordinate MAJCOM-unique
   TCNOs with the AFNOSC to ensure the network defense and network operations aspects of
   TCNO-directed actions are evaluated for their overall impact on the AFEN.
3.4. Releasing Authority.
   3.4.1. The AFNOSC is the only organization authorized to release an Air Force-wide TCNO.
   3.4.2. NOSCs can release a TCNO for units within their AOR.
3.5. Establishing Time Compliance Network Order (TCNO) Priority. The releasing agency
assigns a TCNO priority based on an assessment of the scope and potential impact of the
vulnerability to the AFEN and supported operations and where applicable, to comply with JTF-
GNO implementation and reporting requirements. NOSCs releasing a MAJCOM-specific TCNO
should coordinate with the AFNOSC when assigning priority. The five defined priorities are
summarized in Table 3.1.

Table 3.1. TCNO Priority Categories.

Priority   Description
Critical Widespread and imminent/ongoing threat to the AFEN and supported operations.
Serious Widespread threat to the AFEN and supported operations is expected.
High       Threat to the AFEN and supported operations is likely.
Medium Threat to the AFEN is possible but is mitigated by such factors as difficulty of
       exploitation, limited deployment of vulnerable operating system, etc.
Low        Threat to the AFEN is unlikely due the assessed difficulty of exploiting the
           vulnerability.


3.6. Assigning TCNO Suspense Dates. For each TCNO generated, the releasing organization
will assign several key suspense dates to help prioritize work by tasked organizations and to
ensure information exchange reporting requirements are met.
   3.6.1. Receipt Acknowledgment Date. The date by which tasked organizations will
   acknowledge receipt of the TCNO to their next higher echelon.
   3.6.2. Initial Compliance Statistics Date. The date by which tasked organizations will
   provide their first compliance statistics update to their next-higher echelon.
   3.6.3. Compliance Date. The date by which tasked organizations must achieve full
   compliance with the implementation actions mandated by the TCNO.
   3.6.4. Table 3.2 provides guidance for establishing each of the required dates.
 20                                                      AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011

 5      Low

NOTES:
      1. Organizations not manned 24 hours, 7 days-a-week, will acknowledge receipt the next
         duty day.
      2. The compliance reporting timeframes listed are the maximum allowed. More restrictive
         compliance dates may be established by the originating organization based on the
         assessed threat or as necessary to meet higher echelon requirements (i.e., a NOSC can
         shorten NCC compliance dates, an NCC can shorten WM/FSA compliance dates).
3.7. Assigning a Tracking Number. TCNO tracking numbers are built based on the day they
are released (recorded as Julian date and year) and the order of release during that given day. The
standard numbering format is: the identifier ―TCNO,‖ issuing agency, four-digit year, three-digit
Julian date, a three-digit increment number, and a single character revision identifier. For
example, the tracking number assigned to the first TCNO released by the AFNOSC on 19
January 2004 would be ―TCNO AFNOSC 2004-019-001‖. If the original TCNO is revised, the
tracking number becomes ―TCNO AFNOSC 2004-019-001A‖, a revision of the ―A‖ version will
bear the revision identifier ―B‖ and so on.
3.8. Providing Implementation Details.
     3.8.1. Identify the affected operating systems, applications, and versions. This information
     helps responsible individuals quickly assess the TCNO’s applicability to their systems.
     3.8.2. Provide step-by-step countermeasure implementation instructions. Sort the
     countermeasures by platform (e.g., RISC, Intel, Macintosh) and by operating system (e.g.,
     WIN NT/2000/XP, UNIX, LINUX) whenever possible. Prepare written instructions for
     network professionals at the journeyman-level to afford some assistance for system
     administrators and help expedite countermeasure implementations. Due to the possible
     variety of system configurations, it’s impossible to write detailed implementation instructions
     for every scenario, therefore NOSCs, NCCs, and PMOs/SPOs may augment the instructions
     as outlined below:
AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011                                                                 21


       3.8.2.1. NOSCs and NCCs may augment the AFNOSC’s detailed, step-by-step
       implementation instructions as required so that apprentice-level network and system
       administration personnel can implement the countermeasures.
       3.8.2.2. PMOs/SPOs may augment the AFNOSC’s step-by-step implementation
       instructions as required. Write instructions so that apprentice-level network and system
       administration personnel can implement the countermeasures. When specific
       implementation procedures other than those provided by AFNOSC, PMO or SPO are
       required, provide the sources to obtain those procedures.
   3.8.3. Include an estimate of the downtime required to implement the countermeasures.
   3.8.4. Identify residual risks associated with non-compliance; i.e., not implementing
   countermeasures. Consider the worst-case scenario and chances for exploitation.
3.9. Specifying Justification. The releasing agency will encapsulate or reference applicable
IAVAs, IAVBs, TAs, JTF-GNO CTOs, and related TCNOs/C4 NOTAMs in all TCNOs. These
references help the AFNETOPS and acquisition communities correlate TCNOs with DOD-level
messages.
3.10. Other Time Compliance Network Order (TCNO) Content. The releasing agency may
list other relevant information about the vulnerability and countermeasure in the TCNO. This
may include information from sources like an associated IAVA, vendor security notice, etc.
3.11. Example Time Compliance Network Order (TCNO). Refer to Attachment 2 for a
TCNO example.

Section 3C—TCNO Dissemination and Acknowledgment

3.12. Dissemination Timelines. Timely dissemination of vulnerability and countermeasure
information to the personnel responsible for implementation is critical to ensure the integrity and
availability of the AFEN. All involved organizations will ensure critical and serious priority
TCNOs are disseminated to their subordinate organizations within 24 hours of receipt. High,
medium, and low priority TCNOs will be disseminated at the originator’s discretion.
3.13. Single Distribution List. The AFNOSC will maintain a single distribution list of Air
Force units that must receive AFNOSC-generated TCNOs to include:
   3.13.1. Action Addressees: NOSCs, and all Air Force-level PMOs and SPOs not
   administratively assigned to AFMC.
   3.13.2. Information Addressees: SAF/XCIF, HQ USAF/XOIW, Numbered Air Force
   SC/A6s, HQ AFCA/EVPI, HQ AFCA/ECF/ECN, and others as required.
3.14. Time Compliance Network Order (TCNO) Dissemination. The AFNOSC and NOSCs
will disseminate TCNOs using eTANG and/or SIPRNET electronic mail (E-mail). All
organizations send or forward a TCNO as follows:
   3.14.1. The AFNOSC disseminates TCNOs to NOSCs, FOA/DRU NCCs/MSCs and all Air
   Force program offices not administratively assigned to AFMC.
   3.14.2. The NOSC disseminates TCNOs to all NCCs within its AOR and to its MAJCOM-
   level PMOs and SPOs.

   3.14.3. The NCC disseminates TCNOs to all FSAs and WMs within the NCC’s AOR. This
   includes host, tenant, and GSU organizations serviced by the NCC.
   3.14.4. All Air Force tenant units on Air Force installations to include FOAs and DRUs must
   coordinate with their servicing NCCs to receive TCNOs.
   3.14.5. PMOs/SPOs forward TCNOs to the applicable Joint PMO for evaluation under the
   following conditions:
       3.14.5.1. Programs for which the Air Force is not the lead service.
       3.14.5.2. For a TCNO that was not generated as a result of an IAVA.
3.15. Acknowledging Time Compliance Network Orders (TCNO). Subordinate units and
recipients will acknowledge receipt of the TCNO to their next higher echelon.
   3.15.1. NCCs will receive and compile TCNO acknowledgement reports from FSAs and
   WMs and will acknowledge receipt of the TCNO to their NOSC.
   3.15.2. NOSCs receive and compile TCNO acknowledgement reports from their NCCs and
   MAJCOM-level PMOs and SPOs and will acknowledge receipt of the TCNO to the
   AFNOSC.
   3.15.3. DELETED
   3.15.4. The AFNOSC will receive TCNO acknowledgement reports from NOSCs, and Air
   Force-level PMOs and SPOs.
   3.15.5. The AFNOSC sends IAVA acknowledgments to JTF-GNO within the timeframes
   specified by the IAVA.
   3.15.6. Acknowledgment by subordinate to higher-echelon organizations will be
   accomplished using one of the following methods:
       3.15.6.1. Organizations will use eTANG to acknowledge receipt according to the
       timeframes established by the recipient’s next higher echelon.
       3.15.6.2. Organizations that do not have access to eTANG will send acknowledgement
       reports via SIPRNET E-mail. The subject line of the message will be in the format
       ―ACKNOWLEDGEMENT RECEIPT FOR TCNO Tracking Number‖ where TCNO
       Tracking Number is the assigned number for the TCNO being acknowledged. For
       example, ―ACKNOWLEDGEMENT RECEIPT FOR TCNO AFNOSC 2004-052-001‖.

Section 3D—TCNO Implementation

3.16. Implementing Time Compliance Network Orders (TCNO). The goal of the TCNO
process is the mitigation of risk to the AFEN through the implementation of network
vulnerability countermeasures. Countermeasures will generally entail configuration changes to
systems, installation of software patches, or the search for and removal of specific files or tools
used for malicious purposes. The AFNOSC directs NOSCs, NCCs, PMOs, and SPOs to
implement TCNOs using the information and guidance contained within the TCNO.
Organizations should submit a request for an extension as described in Section 3E if there are
valid reasons the TCNO-directed timeline cannot be met for the application of countermeasures
to workstations.
AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011                                                                23


3.17. Two-Person Compliance. NOSC and NCC personnel will follow a Two-Person
Compliance process for all TCNO-directed countermeasures applied to core servers or
infrastructure components. The process is as follows:
   3.17.1. One NOSC/NCC crew member, the TCNO implementer, will apply the TCNO-
   directed countermeasure using the procedures outlined in the TCNO. Once countermeasure
   implementation is complete, the TCNO implementer will verify the application of the
   countermeasure by checking file versions/dates, registry settings, or other applicable
   indications of successful countermeasure implementation.
   3.17.2. Once the TCNO-directed countermeasure is verified by the TCNO implementer, a
   second NOSC/NCC crew member, the TCNO validator, will validate the successful
   application of the countermeasure by verifying the procedures outlined in the TCNO were
   followed and by checking file version/dates, registry settings, or other applicable indications
   of successful countermeasure implementation.
   3.17.3. The TCNO implementer and validator will document the implementation of the
   TCNO-directed countermeasure as outlined in paragraph 3.26.4.
3.18. FSA and WM Actions. The ultimate goal is to be able to achieve TCNO implementation
through automated means but there are many occasions when implementation must be manually
accomplished on workstations or functional servers at the FSA- and WM-level. In these
instances, FSAs and WMs will implement TCNOs according to the step-by-step instructions in
the TCNO, or as directed by the system’s configuration controlling authority (e.g., PMO or
SPO).
   3.18.1. FSAs and WMs must coordinate all TCNO activities with the servicing NCC.
   3.18.2. Specific local configurations or processes may preclude FSAs and WMs from
   following the TCNO step-by-step instructions exactly. In these situations, variations to the
   step-by-step instructions are authorized, provided compliance with the TCNO is achieved
   and verified.
   3.18.3. FSAs and WMs discovering errors in the step-by-step instructions that could
   potentially damage systems or make the countermeasure ineffective should immediately send
   that information to their next higher AFNETOPS echelon. Similarly, report changes to the
   instructions that could expedite or clarify countermeasure implementation. Forward this
   information through the reporting hierarchy to the AFNOSC for their consideration. If
   warranted, the AFNOSC may release a revised version of the original TCNO to reflect the
   new guidance.
3.19. PMO and SPO Actions.
   3.19.1. PMOs and SPOs are responsible for controlling the configuration of their functional
   systems and must establish procedures to evaluate the applicability of TCNOs to their
   systems. FSAs are responsible for the actual implementation of TCNO countermeasures on
   functional systems, but should only proceed with the permission of the PMO, SPO, NOSC,
   NCC or as established in the program Configuration Management Plan. PMOs and SPOs will
   establish procedures for each of the following situations:
      3.19.1.1. The TCNO does not apply to the program. Provide a reason (e.g., the affected
      operating system is not used by the system).
 24                                                      AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011


       3.19.1.2. The TCNO applies to the program and the FSAs are authorized to implement
       the countermeasure according to the procedures contained in the TCNO.
       3.19.1.3. The TCNO applies to the program but the FSAs are not authorized to
       implement the countermeasure according to the procedures contained in the TCNO. In
       this case, specify the actual implementation procedures or a source for those procedures.
       3.19.1.4. The TCNO applies to the program but actual implementation procedures are
       not yet available. In this case, provide a reason the implementation procedures are not
       available (e.g., procedures are being tested, software release is being built) and an action
       plan with timelines for completing required actions.
       3.19.1.5. The applicability of the TCNO to the program is not known at this time. In this
       case, provide an action plan for evaluating applicability of the TCNO.
   3.19.2. For each of the scenarios elaborated in paragraph 3.19.1 the following reporting
   guidance applies:
       3.19.2.1. All PMOs/SPOs will utilize the ENOSC web-based status page to maintain
       TCNO-specific applicability/status information as outlined in paragraph 3.19.1.
       3.19.2.2. Air Force-level PMOs/SPOs will notify the AFNOSC as soon as TCNO
       applicability is determined and/or implementation procedures are available. The
       AFNOSC will in-turn notify the NOSCs to begin TCNO implementation (see
       Attachment 3, Example 1 for a sample message).
       3.19.2.3. MAJCOM-controlled PMOs and SPOs will notify their parent NOSC as soon
       as TCNO applicability is determined and/or implementation procedures are available (see
       Attachment 3, Example 2 for a sample message).
   3.19.3. PMOs and SPOs will ensure all previous TCNOs are incorporated into new system
   development.

Section 3E—TCNO Extensions

3.20. General Guidance. On rare occasions, extensions to TCNOs may be required to achieve
compliance. An approved extension authorizes the delay of compliance with a TCNO
countermeasure for a specified period past the required TCNO compliance date.
   3.20.1. Extensions will only be granted for TCNOs where additional time is required to
   bring affected workstations into compliance. Extensions will not be granted for achieving
   TCNO compliance on affected core servers, infrastructure components or functional servers.
   3.20.2. An extension does not grant the requesting agency the authority to accept the
   vulnerabilities or risks identified in the TCNO indefinitely; rather, it is approval to accept the
   risk for a specified period based on an operational risk management decision.
3.21. Extension Request Format. Refer to Attachment 4 for required extension content.
3.22. Processing Extensions. The extension process has been broken into three sequential
categories that are summarized in Table 3.3 Table 3.4 outlines the required endorsement and
approval authorities by category of extension and requesting organization.
AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011                                                                  25

Third (Note 2)            Second extension compliance date up to two years (91 days – 2 years
                          from original compliance date)

NOTES:

   1. First extension requests should be submitted as soon as the inability to comply is known
      but not later than 7 days before the TCNO-specified compliance date.
   2. Second and third extension requests should be submitted as soon as the inability to comply
      is known but not later than 14 days before the expiration date of the previously-approved
      extension

Notes:
     1. In those cases where the MAJCOM DAA has assumed the responsibility of the wing/base
        enclave DAA, the request for extension must still be endorsed by the host wing
        commander. Refer to AFI 33-202, Volume 1, Network and Computer Security, for the
        definition and assignment of DAAs.
     2. Send extension requests electronically to the following E-mail account: Secure:
        afnosc@barksdale.af.smil.mil.
3.23. Program Management Office (PMO) and System Program Office (SPO) Extension
Requests. PMOs and SPOs will comply with the timetable and endorsement levels established
in Table 3.3 and Table 3.4 when requesting extensions for the development and dissemination
of countermeasures for client-side (workstation-based) functional applications (e.g., DMS
AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011                                                                 27


client). PMOs and SPOs must ensure the functional system DAA understands that approving a
first extension or endorsing a second or third extension leads to an acceptance of residual risk
that applies to network enclaves outside the functional system DAA’s span of control.
3.24. Evaluating Extension Requests. Based on the category of extension (i.e., first, second,
third) the approval authority (see Table 3.4) will conduct an overall analysis of the residual risk
to the AFEN and supported operations posed by the non-compliant workstations being allowed
to continue to operate. By approving an extension, the approval authority is accepting any stated
mitigating actions and the associated risks.
   3.24.1. First extension approval authorities will:
       3.24.1.1. Log and track all extension requests (i.e., recommendations, approvals,
       extensions, disapprovals, and terminations) throughout the extension process.
       3.24.1.2. Inform the requesting organization in writing whether the requested extension
       has been approved or disapproved.
           3.24.1.2.1. If the evaluation of the extension request leads to a disapproval, the
           extension approval authority will contact the requestor to determine if additional risk
           mitigation procedures are available.
               3.24.1.2.1.1. If additional risk mitigation procedures are available, the requesting
               organization may supplement their original extension request package and request
               reevaluation of their request.
               3.24.1.2.1.2. If additional risk mitigation approval procedures are not available,
               the extension approval authority will direct any required corrective actions based
               on the assessed risk to the AFEN (e.g., disconnect/isolate non-compliant
               workstations from the network)
           3.24.1.2.2. First extension approval authority extension approvals/disapprovals will
           address the following in their response:
               3.24.1.2.2.1. Whether the      level     of   risk   imposed   on   the   AFEN    is
               acceptable/unacceptable.
               3.24.1.2.2.2. State the potential operational impacts to the AFEN.
       3.24.1.3. Provide the AFNOSC a copy of all approved first extensions.
       3.24.1.4. Periodically review existing extensions to ensure requesting organizations are
       making satisfactory progress towards achieving full compliance and/or processing a
       second extension request as necessary.
   3.24.2. For all second and third extensions the AFNOSC will:
       3.24.2.1. Log and track all extension requests (i.e., recommendations, approvals,
       extensions, disapprovals, and terminations) throughout the extension process.
       3.24.2.2. Inform the requesting organization in writing whether the requested extension
       has been approved or disapproved.

           3.24.2.2.1. If the evaluation of the extension request leads to a disapproval, the
           AFNOSC will contact the requestor to determine if additional risk mitigation
           procedures are available.
               3.24.2.2.1.1. If additional risk mitigation procedures are available, the requesting
               organization may supplement their original extension request package and request
               reevaluation of their request.
               3.24.2.2.1.2. If additional risk mitigation approval procedures are not available,
               the AFNOSC will direct any required corrective actions based on the assessed risk
               to the AFEN (e.g., disconnect/isolate non-compliant workstations from the
               network).
           3.24.2.2.2. AFNOSC extension approvals/disapprovals will address the following in
           an endorsement cover letter:
               3.24.2.2.2.1. Whether the      level   of    risk   imposed   on   the   AFEN     is
               acceptable/unacceptable.
               3.24.2.2.2.2. State the potential operational impacts to the AFEN.
       3.24.2.3. Periodically review existing extensions to ensure requesting organizations are
       making satisfactory progress towards achieving full compliance and/or processing an
       additional extension request as necessary.
   3.24.3. The AFNOSC will make current TCNO extension information available to NCCs,
   NOSCs, PMOs, SPOs, and SAF/XCI.

Section 3F—TCNO Compliance Reporting

3.25. General Guidance. The ability of commanders to maintain situational awareness of the
health and availability of Air Force information systems and networks is essential to their ability
to make informed decisions for accomplishing assigned missions. Ensuring commanders remain
aware of risks to the AFEN and Air Force information systems dictates the status of TCNO
compliance be accurately tracked, compiled, and assessed.
3.26. Recording TCNO Compliance. Tracking and recording TCNO compliance begins at the
level the TCNO is implemented (i.e., FSA or WM for manually implemented TCNOs on
workstations or functional servers, NCC or NOSC for automated TCNO implementation or for
implementation of TCNOs on core servers and infrastructure components). Compliance with
each TCNO will be tracked to the ―asset‖ level to ensure all required network/system
components are addressed. For the purposes of this instruction, an asset is defined as any device
connected to the AFEN. Devices include but are not limited to workstations, servers,
infrastructure components (e.g., router, switch) and networked peripherals (e.g., network
printers). Compliance with a TCNO is accomplished when all actions directed in the TCNO are
accomplished on all affected assets. The implementation of mitigation actions not specified in a
TCNO do not constitute compliance, but may be considered during the extension process and
must be annotated in an extension request.
   3.26.1. WMs will record and maintain the following information for each manually-
   implemented TCNO:
AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011                                                               29


     3.26.1.1. The name, rank, unit, office symbol, phone number, and E-mail address for the
     person who implemented the TCNO.
     3.26.1.2. The date receipt of the TCNO was acknowledged to the host NCC.
     3.26.1.3. A list of the compliant assets.
     3.26.1.4. Exception details, as applicable, to include the identifying information (e.g.,
     computer name) for assets on which TCNO compliance was not achieved and the specific
     reasons TCNO compliance was not achieved or was delayed.
     3.26.1.5. The date compliance was achieved and reported to the host NCC.
  3.26.2. FSAs will record and maintain the following information for each TCNO
  implemented on their functional system. NOTE: These requirements are in addition to and
  separate from any documentation requirements levied by the controlling PMO or SPO:
     3.26.2.1. The name, rank, unit, office symbol, phone number, and E-mail address for the
     person who implemented the TCNO.
     3.26.2.2. The date receipt of the TCNO was acknowledged to the host NCC.
     3.26.2.3. Exception details, as applicable, to include any reason TCNO compliance was
     not achieved or was delayed (e.g., the program PMO and SPO is developing a software
     release). Record the estimated date compliance will be achieved.
     3.26.2.4. The date compliance was achieved, verified, and reported to the host NCC.
  3.26.3. NOSC/NCC crew members will record and maintain the following information for
  each TCNO implemented by automated means (e.g., a script designed to run and install a
  software patch at startup or network login, automated patch distribution):
     3.26.3.1. The name, rank, unit, office symbol, phone number, and E-mail address for the
     person who implemented the TCNO.
     3.26.3.2. The date receipt of the TCNO was acknowledged.
     3.26.3.3. A description of the automated process utilized.
     3.26.3.4. A list of all the assets successfully patched via the automated process.
     3.26.3.5. Exception details, as applicable, to include the identifying details (e.g.,
     computer name) of assets on which TCNO compliance was not achieved and the specific
     reasons TCNO compliance was not achieved or was delayed.
     3.26.3.6. The date compliance was achieved, verified, and reported to the next higher
     level.
  3.26.4. NOSC/NCC crew members will record and maintain the following information for
  each TCNO implemented on a core server or infrastructure component (see paragraph 3.17
  for further detail on two-person compliance). NOTE: The information listed below will be
  recorded by asset (i.e., individual core server or infrastructure component) so that a complete
  record of changes made to that asset is retained:
     3.26.4.1. Identifying information for the asset (e.g., server name, network address).

       not achieved or was delayed.
       3.26.4.6. The date compliance was achieved, verified, and reported to the next higher
       level.
   3.26.5. FSAs, WMs, NCCs, NOSCs, and the AFNOSC will retain the specific information
   listed above as well as all other relevant TCNO compliance related communications in
   accordance with Air Force Web-RIMS RDS, https://webrims.amc.af.mil/rds/index.cfm.
3.27. Compiling TCNO Compliance Statistics. In addition to the information listed in
paragraph 3.26, FSAs, WMs, NCCs, NOSCs, and the AFNOSC will compile the following
information at their respective levels. This information is used for up-channel reporting of TCNO
compliance. NOTE: FSAs and WMs are only responsible for compiling this information for
those TCNOs applied manually.
   3.27.1. Unclassified Workstations.

       3.27.4.1. The total number of assets affected by the TCNO.
AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011                                                                   31

       3.27.4.3. The total number of non-compliant assets.
       3.27.4.4. If TCNO compliance has not been achieved due to the unavailability of a
       patch/countermeasure for a PMO/SPO-controlled functional system, document the
       specific functional system and the number of functional system assets affected.
   3.27.5. If the TCNO compliance date has passed, include an explanation for why the
   organization has been unable to achieve TCNO compliance, describe the mitigation actions
   that have been taken to protect the noncompliant assets, and provide an estimated compliance
   date.
3.28. Initial and Follow-On TCNO Compliance Statistics Reporting. The timely up-channel
flow of TCNO compliance statistics through the AFNETOPS hierarchy provides a picture of
overall risk to the AFEN and Air Force information systems. All organizations have the
responsibility to ensure their compliance status reports are timely, accurate, and reflect the actual
compliance status of the network enclaves and information systems for which they have
responsibility. Initial and follow-up reporting of compliance statistics will be conducted as
follows:
   3.28.1. FSAs and WMs will record and compile their TCNO compliance information for
   those TCNOs applied manually and report it to their servicing NCC or NOSC in the manner
   and within the initial reporting timeframe specified by their servicing NCC or NOSC.
   3.28.2. NCCs will work with all FSAs and WMs within the NCC’s AOR to attain initial
   compliance status as quickly as possible. NCCs will submit initial compliance statistics to
   their NOSC within the initial reporting timeframe directed by their NOSC.
   3.28.3. NOSCs will ensure initial compliance statistics from subordinate NCCs are received,
   compiled, and forwarded to the AFNOSC within the initial reporting timeframe established
   by the TCNO.
   3.28.4. DELETED
   3.28.5. The AFNOSC will record and compile TCNO compliance statistics from all NOSCs.
   The AFNOSC will provide updates of Air Force compliance with TCNO-linked IAVAs to
   the JTF-GNO based on this compiled information.
   3.28.6. FSAs, WMs, NCCs, and NOSCs will send follow-on reports to their next higher
   echelon as compliance status changes. To facilitate up-channel reporting to HQ USAF and
   JTF-GNO, all roll up status must be submitted weekly to the AFNOSC no later than 1800Z
   every Monday until full TCNO compliance is achieved.
   3.28.7. Reporting of compliance statistics by subordinate to higher-echelon organizations
   will be accomplished using one of the following methods:
       3.28.7.1. Organizations will use eTANG to report compliance statistics according to the
       timeframes established by the recipient’s next higher echelon.
       3.28.7.2. Organizations that do not have access to eTANG will send a compliance
       statistics message via SIPRNET E-mail. The subject line of the message will be in the
       format ―COMPLIANCE STATISTICS FOR TCNO Tracking Number‖ where TCNO
 32                                                   AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011


       Tracking Number is the assigned number for the TCNO being reported. For example,
       ―COMPLIANCE STATISTICS FOR TCNO AFNOSC 2004-052-001.‖
3.29. Preventing Duplicate TCNO Compliance Information. To ensure an accurate picture
of the Air Force’s TCNO compliance can be built, it is critical that TCNO compliance be
reported through only one hierarchical reporting channel.
   3.29.1. The host NCC is responsible for compiling and reporting TCNO compliance
   information for all host base units connected to any NCC-controlled network.
   3.29.2. All Air Force tenant units, to include tenant GSUs, residing on an Air Force base and
   connected to any NCC-controlled network shall comply with the security policy of the host
   NCC. Accordingly, all NCC-serviced tenant units and GSUs must report compliance through
   their host NCC, regardless of parent MAJCOM/FOA/DRU.
   3.29.3. An NCC-serviced tenant unit or GSU may be tasked to provide copies of TCNO
   compliance information to their parent MAJCOM/FOA/DRU but that parent unit should not
   include that information in their consolidated report. The tenant unit and GSU must inform
   their parent unit that their compliance status has already been reported to their host NCC.
   3.29.4. Per CJCSM 6510.01, non-Air Force tenant units connected to an Air Force-network
   must report IAVA compliance information to their parent combatant command, service, or
   agency and they must provide an information copy to their host NCC. Compliance
   information for these non-Air Force tenant units should be included in up-channel
   compliance reports but should be accompanied by a comment indicating that it is for
   information only; i.e., that it should not be reported by the AFNOSC to the JTF-GNO for
   those TCNOs linked to an IAVA.
   3.29.5. This paragraph provides a practical example of the guidance provided in the
   preceding paragraphs. The host NCC on an ACC base services an AETC tenant unit. The
   AETC tenant unit will report TCNO compliance status to the host NCC. The host base NCC
   will include the AETC tenant unit’s TCNO compliance status when reporting to the ACC
   NOSC. The ACC NOSC subsequently includes the AETC tenant unit’s TCNO compliance
   status information when reporting ACC’s TCNO compliance status to the AFNOSC. AETC
   may also task their tenant unit to report TCNO compliance statistics to the AETC NOSC;
   however, when the AETC NOSC reports TCNO compliance status to the AFNOSC they
   must not include their tenant unit’s compliance information as the AFNOSC has already
   received the status of those assets in the data reported by ACC.
3.30. Resolving TCNO Compliance Reporting Discrepancies. Resolve all discrepancies with
reported compliance information at the lowest level possible. In other words, NCCs should
resolve TCNO compliance status discrepancies reported by FSAs/WMs before reporting status to
their NOSC, and the NOSCs should resolve obvious discrepancies before reporting their status to
the AFNOSC. For example, a PMO has indicated TCNO compliance cannot be achieved on their
functional system until the next scheduled software release, which exceeds the TCNO
compliance date, yet the local FSA reports TCNO compliance. This is an obvious discrepancy
and should be resolved before sending the report to the NOSC.

Section 3G—Assessing TCNO Compliance
AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011                                                              33


3.31. TCNO Compliance Levels. Assessing TCNO and associated IAVA compliance
information provides commanders at all levels with situational awareness of the risks imposed on
the AFEN and Air Force information systems. Achieving 100% compliance with all TCNOs is
and will remain the ultimate goal to ensure the security and integrity of the AFEN and the
information contained therein. The following compliance assessment construct grants
commanders the flexibility to balance available resources against operational risk while still
meeting Air Force compliance standards. The following paragraphs and Table 3.5 describe the
five defined compliance levels.
   3.31.1. Compliance Level 1 (CL 1), GREEN. 100% of core servers and infrastructure
   components are patched with documented two-person compliance (see paragraph 3.17),
   100% of functional servers are patched, and at least 95% of all workstations are patched. The
   following actions must be taken and documented in a mitigation plan for those workstations
   not yet patched:
       3.31.1.1. Establish positive identification of all workstations not patched.
       3.31.1.2. Conduct an operational risk management assessment of potential impact to
       local and Air Force missions if vulnerable workstations are exploited.
       3.31.1.3. Ensure the ability exists to isolate all vulnerable workstations should they be
       exploited.
       3.31.1.4. Ensure all attempts possible have been made to patch all workstations through
       both automated and manual means.
   3.31.2. Compliance Level 2 (CL 2), YELLOW. 100% of core servers and infrastructure
   components are patched with documented two-person compliance (see paragraph 3.17),
   100% of functional servers are patched, and less than 95% of all workstations are patched
   and an extension has been submitted and approved by the appropriate authority as listed in
   Table 3.4.
   3.31.3. Compliance Level 3 (CL 3), ORANGE. 100% of core servers and infrastructure
   components are patched with documented two-person compliance (see paragraph 3.17),
   100% of functional servers are patched, and less than 95% of all workstations are patched
   and an extension has not been approved.
   3.31.4. Compliance Level 4 (CL 4), RED. Less than 100% of core servers, infrastructure
   components, and functional servers are patched.
   3.31.5. Compliance Level 5 (CL 5), BLUE. This compliance level is identical to Compliance
   Level 1 with the exception that it is used when one or more functional servers cannot be
   patched by the local installation due to the fact that the controlling PMO/SPO has not
   released a patch/fix action.

                                            Chapter 4

                                 C4 NOTAM MANAGEMENT

4.1. Introduction. Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Notice to Airmen (C4
NOTAM) are closely related to TCNOs with the primary difference being that they are
informative in nature and are not used to direct actions. They are used by all organizations within
the AFNETOPS hierarchy. They are the primary means for disseminating network information
that does not direct specific action to be taken, or compliance to be tracked. In some cases,
acknowledging receipt of a C4 NOTAM may be required.
4.2. Types of C4 NOTAMs. The types of C4 NOTAMs are Informative, Scheduled Event,
Unscheduled Event, and Summary.
   4.2.1. Informative C4 NOTAMs (IC4N). IC4Ns can be received from and sent by all levels
   of the AFNETOPS hierarchy. They serve as the primary vehicle for disseminating network
   information to Airmen that does not require specific actions to be taken or compliance to be
   tracked. In some cases, acknowledging receipt of an IC4N may be required. IC4Ns do not
   require compliance reporting, instead the responsibility remains with the recipient to take
   actions that best fit their situation. See Attachment 5 for a sample.
   4.2.2. Unscheduled Event C4 NOTAMs (UEC4N). UEC4Ns are the standard format for
   network event reporting. All levels of the AFNETOPS hierarchy can transmit a UEC4N to
   notify others of any significant network event. The most common types of information
   included in this report will be, but not limited to, network and equipment outages, incidents,
   and newly detected vulnerabilities. The sender will be responsible for releasing, initial,
   update, and final UEC4Ns, as needed. See Attachment 6 for a sample UEC4N and Chapter
   5, Chapter 6, and Chapter 7 for guidance on the use of UEC4Ns within the incident,
   vulnerability, security incident, and service interruption reporting processes.
   4.2.3. Scheduled Event C4 NOTAMs (SEC4N). SEC4Ns are used by all levels of the
   AFNETOPS hierarchy to report scheduled network events including, but not limited to,
   preventive maintenance, upgrades, or authorized service interruptions. The sender will be
   responsible for releasing, initial, update, and final SEC4N as needed. See Attachment 6 for a
   sample and Chapter 7 for guidance on the use of SEC4Ns within the service interruption
   reporting process.
   4.2.4. Summary C4 NOTAMs (SC4N). SC4Ns are similar in nature to an Informative C4
   NOTAM but have a broader scope and are prepared and transmitted on a recurring basis,
   typically once each day. Their primary use is for up-channel notification of summary status
   from the various NCCs to their NOSC and from the various NOSCs to the AFNOSC. See
   Attachment 7 for a sample.
4.3. C4 NOTAM Formatting Guidance. To facilitate standardized report formats, C4
NOTAMs will be built using the same general template as TCNOs. The following paragraphs
provide guidance specific to the generation of C4 NOTAMs.
   4.3.1. Assigning a Tracking Number. C4 NOTAM tracking numbers are built based on the
   day they are released (recorded as Julian date and year) and the order of release during that
   given day. The standard numbering format is: the identifier ―C4-N,‖ issuing agency, four-
 36                                                   AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011


   digit year, three-digit Julian date, and a three-digit increment number. For example, the
   tracking number assigned to the first C4 NOTAM released on 19 Jan 2004 would be ―C4-N
   AFNOSC 2004-019-001.‖
   4.3.2. Establishing C4 NOTAM Priority. The releasing agency assigns a C4 NOTAM
   priority based on an assessment of the scope and potential impact of the topic being
   addressed to the AFEN and supported operations. NOSCs releasing a MAJCOM-specific C4
   NOTAM do not need to coordinate with the AFNOSC when assigning priority. The five
   defined priorities to be used when generating C4 NOTAMs are summarized in Table 4.1.

Table 4.1. C4 NOTAM Priority Categories.

 Priority Description
 Critical The topic being addressed informs recipients of a widespread and imminent/ongoing
          threat to the AFEN and/or provides details on a network/system outage negatively
          impacting ongoing combat operations.
 Serious The topic being addressed informs recipients of an expected threat to the AFEN and/or
         provides details on a network/system outage negatively impacting ongoing combat
         support operations.
 High      The topic being addressed informs recipients of a likely threat to the AFEN and/or
           provides details on a network/system outage negatively impacting ongoing
           administrative/business operations across a major enclave of the AFEN (i.e.,
           MAJCOM-wide outage).
 Medium The topic being addressed informs recipients of a threat not expected to impact the
        AFEN and/or provides details on a network/system outage negatively impacting
        ongoing administrative/business operations at a single Air Force installation.
 Low       The topic being addressed is purely informative in nature.


4.4. C4 NOTAM Dissemination. Originating organizations will disseminate C4 NOTAMs
using eTANG where available. If the originating organization does not have access to eTANG,
then SIPRNET E-mail or NIPRNET DMS message are the preferred alternate means of
distribution.
AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011                                                               37

                    INCIDENT AND VULNERABILITY REPORTING

Section 5A—Introduction and General Procedures

5.1. Purpose. The overall purpose of the various incident and vulnerability reporting processes
is to improve the overall security posture of the AFEN, Air Force information systems, and
stand-alone computing devices through quick positive control and reporting of network and
information system incidents. The following sections detail the minimum required policies,
procedures, and report formats to handle, process, and report:
   5.1.1. Incidents. This includes network/system incidents such as intrusions, scans, probes,
   and malicious logic events. Reporting accurate incident information as close to near-real-time
   as possible is crucial to effective countermeasure response. Refer to Section 5B for specific
   guidance.
   5.1.2. Vulnerabilities. Anyone detecting a new vulnerability must report it through the chain
   of command. Timely, accurate vulnerability reports are crucial to the success of mitigating
   the threats posed by identified vulnerabilities. A TCNO may be generated as a direct result of
   vulnerability reports. Refer to Section 5C for specific guidance.
5.2. General Reporting Requirements.
   5.2.1. End users and Air Force network professionals (e.g., NOSC and NCC personnel,
   FSAs, WMs, ISSOs, ISSMs) must report all identified incidents and vulnerabilities.
   5.2.2. The AFNOSC, as the Air Force service component to JTF-GNO, is responsible for
   reporting all incident and vulnerability information in accordance with CJCSM 6510.01, and
   any supplemental direction published by JTF-GNO.
   5.2.3. NOTE: Report Sensitive Compartmented Information incidents, assessments, and
   other unauthorized network activity according to applicable Defense Intelligence Agency or
   National Security Agency procedures.
5.3. Incident and Vulnerability Report Classification Guidance.
   5.3.1. Classified Report Guidance. Mark, handle, store, and transmit all classified reports
   according to AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. Consult security
   classification guides (e.g., AFI 10-2005, Defensive Counter information Security
   Classification Guide), as necessary to assist in assigning an appropriate classification.
   Consider classifying a report when an incident or vulnerability’s impact possesses the
   potential to cause:
       5.3.1.1. Damage, serious damage, or grave damage to national security.
       5.3.1.2. Failure of the entire AFEN, or significant portion thereof.
       5.3.1.3. Failure of one or more MAJCOM networks.
       5.3.1.4. Failure of an entire base network.
       5.3.1.5. Failure of a Command and Control (C2) functional system.
 38                                                     AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011


       5.3.1.6. Significant adverse operational impact to a critical mission due to the aggregated
       effect of an incident (e.g., exploited vulnerability, classified message incident, denial of
       service attack).
   5.3.2. Unclassified Report Guidance. Mark all unclassified reports as ―For Official Use
   Only‖ (FOUO) and protect the report from public distribution under Freedom of Information
   Act Exemption Number 2 from Air Force Supplement to DOD Regulation 5400.7 (DODR
   5400.7/AFSUP1), DOD Freedom of Information Act Program. Mark reports as FOUO when:
       5.3.2.1. An incident DOES NOT result in a compromise or significant adverse impact to
       national security; Air Force, MAJCOM, or wing operational missions or networks.
       5.3.2.2. A report identifies an incident on a specific unclassified network, information
       systems, or stand-alone computing device.

Section 5B—Incident Reporting

5.4. Incidents Defined. Incidents, within the context of this instruction, include attempted
entry, unauthorized entry, and attacks on an information system to include: unauthorized
probing, browsing; disruption or denial of service; altered or destroyed input, processing,
storage, or output of information; or changes to system hardware, firmware, or software
characteristics with or without the users knowledge, instruction or intent (e.g., malicious logic).
An incident may also involve a violation of law. If a violation of law is evident or suspected, the
incident must also be reported to law enforcement organizations for appropriate action. Table
5.1 defines seven distinct incident categories utilized by the Air Force to characterize detected
incidents (derived from CJCSM 6510.01).
AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011                                                                   39


Table 5.1. Incident Categories.

 Category Description
 I            Root-Level Intrusion: An unauthorized person gained root-level access/privileges
              on an Air Force computer/information system/network device.
 II           User-Level Intrusion: An unauthorized person gained user-level privileges on an
              Air Force computer/information system/network device.
 III          Attempted Access: An unauthorized person specifically targeted a
              service/vulnerability on an Air Force computer/information system/network device
              in an attempt to gain unauthorized or increased access/privileges, but was denied
              access.
 IV           Denial of Service (DoS): Use of an Air Force computer/information
              system/network was denied due to an overwhelming volume of unauthorized
              network traffic.
 V            Poor Security Practice: An Air Force computer/information system/network was
              incorrectly configured or a user did not follow established policy.
 VI           Scan/Probe: Open ports on an Air Force computer/information system/network
              device were scanned with no DoS or mission impact.
 VII          Malicious Logic: Hostile code successfully infected an Air Force
              computer/information system/network device. Unless otherwise directed, only
              those computers that were infected will be reported as a Category VII incident.


5.5. Incident Detection. There are several ways an incident may be detected. The primary
detection tool is the fleet of Automated Security Incident Measurement (ASIM) sensors deployed
across the AFEN. Additional techniques employed to detect incidents include but are not limited
to: review of critical audit logs by network professionals (e.g., Firewall logs); virus detection and
prevention software; and reporting of anomalous network/information system events by end
users and network professionals. Reporting accurate incident information as close to near real
time as possible is crucial to effective response.
5.5. (21SW)Incident Detection. Reporting instructions are provided on the 21 SW Form 2,
Virus and Incident Card. A Virus and Incident Card must be attached to every system
connecting to the Peterson Local Area Networks. The 21 SW Form 2 must be completed to
include the name and phone number for the users organizational Primary Information Assurance
Officer (IAO), Alternate IAO, Security Manager, and Computer Support Administrator.
Organizational Information Assurance Officers must ensure all users are trained to know how to
use the 21 SW Virus and Incident Card. The 21 SW Form 2 can be found to print at: www.e-
publishing.af.mil. If there are circumstances requiring organizations to deviate from the 21 SW
Form 2 verbiage (i.e. GSU’s reporting through a local NCC/IA Office), modifications to the
verbiage will be allowed with approval from the 21 SW/IA Office on a case by case basis. All
exceptions should be routed through the WIAO prior to making changes.

5.6. General Incident Response Actions. In addition to the specific reporting actions specified
throughout this section, the AFNOSC, NOSCs, and NCCs are authorized to:
   5.6.1. Terminate network services and isolate an offending network or system until an
   incident is resolved. NOTE: Coordinate these actions with the AFNOSC prior to taking
   action. Also coordinate with the responsible DAA and affected commanders.
   5.6.2. Restore network services and connectivity to systems that were previously terminated
   due to incident response actions.
5.7. ASIM-Identified Incidents. ASIM sensors are utilized to monitor the various enclaves
that make up the AFEN. The events identified by an ASIM sensor are analyzed by crew
members at the NOSCs and the AFNOSC, and Incident Reports (IR) are created for any
confirmed incidents as follows.
   5.7.1. Assign a category for each IR from those defined in Table 5.1.
   5.7.2. The AFNOSC will assign an incident report identification (IRID) number upon
   confirmation of a Category I, II, IV, or VII incident that consists of the letters ―IR‖, the four-
   digit calendar year, and a three-digit serial number. For example: IR-2004-018, where 2004
   is the calendar year and 018 is the 18th incident for that year.
   5.7.3. NOSCs send IRs to the NCC ASIM point of contact (POC) (typically the Intrusion
   Detection Specialist), who in turn forwards the report to the affected network or information
   system owner for action (i.e., end user, WM, FSA, etc.).

                                            Chapter 6

                            SECURITY INCIDENT REPORTING

6.1. Security Incidents. The introduction of information that is classified above the level that a
network, information system, or stand-alone computing device is authorized to process results in
a security incident. Prompt security incident reporting facilitates rapid containment of the
situation and helps to determine how the classified information was introduced to the system, its
overall impact on AFEN operations, the effect on Air Force operational missions, and what can
be done to prevent future occurrences. The most common type of security incident within the
information system environment involves the inadvertent dissemination of classified information
through an unclassified E-mail, either within the body of the E-mail or as an attachment. In these
situations, known as CMIs, additional steps must be taken to prevent the rapid proliferation of
the message throughout the Air Force (see paragraph 6.5).
6.2. Related Guidance. In addition to the reporting requirements established within this
instruction, the following additional reporting guidance must be followed:
   6.2.1. AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. AFI 31-401 provides
   detailed guidance on conducting security incident inquiries/investigations and requires that
   all security incidents involving Information Systems be coordinated with Unit Security
   Managers and the installation Information Security Program Manager (ISPM).
   6.2.2. AFI 33-212, Reporting COMSEC Deviations. AFI 33-212 provides specific guidance
   for dealing with security incidents where communication security (COMSEC) material is
   involved.
6.3. Classification Guidance. Protect the transmission, reception, and storage of security
incident information and reports at the same level of classification as the information
compromised. This guidance applies to all verbal as well as written communications. All details
of the security incident are classified until the systems involved are sanitized and the information
is no longer accessible to unauthorized personnel. Refer to AFI 31-401 for additional guidance.
6.4. Security Incident Reporting. In addition to the security incident reporting and resolution
requirements in AFI 31-401, every person involved in an security incident must provide all
relevant information to their WM, FSA, ISSO, ISSM, etc., or to their respective NCC, NOSC, as
quickly and in as much detail as is known, according to the guidance in this chapter, Table 6.1,
and in Attachment 11.
   6.4.1. Minimum Initial Security Incident Report (SIR) Requirements. The WM, FSA, ISSO,
   or ISSM verbally submits the following information immediately to the NCC via secure
   means:
       6.4.1.1. The location of the file/message (e.g., a shared network drive, a workstation hard
       drive, an end users E-mail store).
       6.4.1.2. The originator of the classified file/message and their organization.
       6.4.1.3. All known personnel who have access to, or are known to have accessed, the
       file. In the case of a CMI, all recipients of the classified information (e.g., file, message)
 46                                                   AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011


       including those to whom the message was originally sent and those to whom the message
       was forwarded.
   6.4.2. SIR Identifier (SIRID). NOSCs will assign a single SIRID for each non-related
   security incident. The tracking number is based on the source (i.e., the MAJCOM, FOA, or
   DRU where the security incident occurred or from where the message originated in the case
   of CMIs) and consists of: the letters ―SI‖; the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU; the four digit
   calendar year; and a serial number. For example: SI-ACC-2004-002, where the ACC NOSC
   is the parent NOSC, 2004 is the calendar year, and 002 is the serial number indicating the
   security incident is the second recorded for that year. The NOSC immediately provides the
   SIRID to its subordinate NCC via secure means.
   6.4.3. SIR Analysis. Each NOSC will track and compile information contained in each SIR
   for analysis purposes to determine the best methods to prevent future occurrences.
6.5. Classified Message Incidents (CMI). In addition to the general security incident actions
elaborated in paragraph 6.4, the servicing NCC must determine whether the contaminated
message has been disseminated beyond its AOR (i.e., base enclave).
   6.5.1. Local Containment. If the NCC is able to verify local containment of the message
   (i.e., no end user has sent it to another base), they will initiate reporting as detailed in
   paragraph 6.4 and Table 6.1, and corrective actions in accordance with paragraph 6.6.
   6.5.2. Multiple Bases Affected. If it is determined that multiple bases are affected, the NCC
   must also determine if the classified message originated on their base or if they were a
   recipient from an outside sender. Once determined, the NCC:
       6.5.2.1. Receiving Base: Notifies the servicing NCC at the originating location via
       secure means and initiates local corrective actions.
       6.5.2.2. Originating Base: Notifies their parent NOSC via secure means to initiate the
       reporting process. The notified NOSC will then notify all other affected NOSCs, who
       will in turn notify their affected bases about the incident. All affected NCCs will
       implement local corrective actions.
6.6. Corrective Actions. To contain and resolve the security incident, NCCs will coordinate all
actions with affected unit security managers, WMs, and the Information Security Program
Manager (ISPM), and will implement sanitization procedures and direct the appropriate WMs to
sanitize affected users’ workstations in accordance with AFSSI 5020, Remanence Security.

                        SERVICE INTERRUPTION REPORTING

Section 7A—Introduction and General Procedures

7.1. Introduction. The Air Force’s reliance on network communications is expanding as more
mission essential processes and systems become automated, integrated, and interconnected via
networks. To ensure maximum availability and capability of the AFEN it is essential that the
AFNETOPS hierarchy maintain situational awareness of the status of both authorized service
interruptions and unscheduled service interruptions.
7.2. Operational Reporting of Mission Impact. In addition to the reporting requirements
defined within this chapter, AFNETOPS organizations will prepare and submit OPREP-3s
through their servicing command post for those authorized or unscheduled service interruptions
that are known to have or are expected to degrade mission capability of an operational unit.
Submit the OPREP-3 as a ―Mission-Impairment‖ event in accordance with AFI 10-206. Include
the AFNOSC as an addressee in addition to the minimum addressees required by AFI 10-206.
7.3. Service Interruption Reporting Classification Guidance. All reporting documents
generated as a result of the processes described within this chapter (i.e., OPREP-3s, SEC4Ns,
UEC4Ns) will be classified according to their content, applicable program trusted facility
manuals, or applicable classification guides.

Section 7B—Authorized Service Interruptions (ASI)

7.4. Authorized Service Interruption (ASI) Definition. ASIs are scheduled periods of
network, equipment, or system downtime required to conduct preventive maintenance actions,
software or equipment upgrades or replacement, system reboots, etc. There are three defined
types of ASIs.
   7.4.1. Preventive Maintenance Inspection (PMI). PMI ASIs are required for any preventive
   maintenance actions accomplished on a recurring basis. Examples include routine
   maintenance of server equipment or server reboots required due to the application of TCNO-
   directed countermeasures.
   7.4.2. Routine. Routine ASIs are required for any network system changes that will require
   an interruption of service to complete. Examples include service interruptions required to
   perform system/software upgrades, or to repair or replace faulty equipment.
   7.4.3. Emergency. Emergency ASIs are for those ad hoc events which require an immediate
   service interruption to correct hazardous or degraded conditions where loss of mission
   capability could occur through lack of immediate action. Examples of emergency outages
   include power problems, equipment malfunctions, imminent system failures, or any
   hazardous condition that requires immediate attention and cannot otherwise be scheduled as a
   routine service interruption.
7.5. ASI Approval Authority.
   7.5.1. The AFNETOPS/CC is the approval authority for routine and emergency ASI requests
   associated with those AFEN links, nodes, functional systems, or services on the AFEN (1)
 50                                                     AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011


   directly supporting an active combat operation; (2) whose compromise or loss could affect
   national security; (3) whose compromise or loss would degrade or disable critical C2
   communications; or (4) whose compromise or loss would negatively impact a preponderance
   of the Air Force. The AFNOSC is the focal point for the coordination of ASIs that must be
   approved by the AFNETOPS/CC. NOTE: The AFNOSC will further elaborate the specific
   links, nodes, functional systems, or services that require AFNETOPS/CC approval through
   the AFNETOPS Special Instructions to Communicators (SPIN-C) and associated daily
   Communications Tasking Orders (CTO).
   7.5.2. The MAJCOM DAA is the approval authority for all PMI ASI requests and those
   routine and emergency ASI requests that do not meet the criteria specified in paragraph 7.5.1.
   The NOSCs are the focal point for the coordination of all ASIs that must be approved by the
   MAJCOM DAA.
7.6. General ASI Coordination Guidance.
   7.6.1. Service interruptions should be scheduled at a time that will have the minimum impact
   on supported end users.
   7.6.2. Requesting organizations must complete applicable local level coordination (e.g.,
   major tenant unit commanders and wing commander for NCCs; MAJCOM directors and
   MAJCOM DAA for NOSCs) on all ASIs prior to submitting the ASI request for approval.
   7.6.3. Attachment 12 outlines the information that must be provided by the requesting
   organization on all ASI requests.
7.7. Submission of ASI Requests for Approval by the AFNETOPS/CC. NOSCs, FOA/DRU
NCC/MSCs, USAF PMO/SPOs will submit all routine and emergency ASI requests affecting
any links, nodes, functional systems, or services as defined in paragraph 7.5.1 to the AFNOSC
Net Operations Division for processing according to the timelines specified in Table 7.1.
7.8. Submission of ASI Requests for Approval by the MAJCOM DAA. NCCs and
MAJCOM PMO/SPOs will submit all PMI ASI requests, and those routine or emergency ASI
requests impacting all links, nodes, functional systems, or services (that do not meet the criteria
specified in paragraph 7.5.1) to their NOSC for processing according to the timelines specified in
Table 7.1.
AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011                                                                 51

                                                           known


7.9. Notification of Approved ASIs.
     7.9.1. The primary means for notifying AFNETOPS organizations of approved ASIs is the
     daily CTO. All AFNETOPS/CC-approved ASIs will be listed in the daily AFNOSC CTO.
     All MAJCOM DAA approved ASIs will be listed in a MAJCOM-specific CTO.
     7.9.2. AFNETOPS organizations responsible for executing approved ASIs will notify all
     affected users 7 days prior, 1 day prior, and again at 1 hour prior to a scheduled service
     interruption.
7.10. Tracking ASIs During Execution. AFNETOPS organizations executing ASIs will
submit an initial SEC4N to the ASI approving authority and any other affected AFNETOPS
organizations upon initiation of the ASI. For ASIs scheduled to exceed four hours in duration, an
update SEC4N will be submitted every four hours, or as directed by the ASI approving authority.
A final SEC4N will be submitted upon successful completion of the ASI.
7.11. Extension of an Ongoing ASI. In the event required ASI actions (i.e., equipment
replacement, software upgrade, etc.) cannot be completed during the time period approved for
the ASI, the organization executing the ASI must request an extension from the ASI approving
authority. If the extension is not approved and normal operations cannot be restored within the
ASI-approved time period, the outage should be reported as an unscheduled service interruption
as described in Section 7C.

Section 7C—Unscheduled Service Interruptions

7.12. Unscheduled Service Interruption (USI) Definition. USIs are those unscheduled
network, equipment, or application outages or degradations that are caused by such things as
environmental problems (e.g., fire, flood, loss of power, loss of air conditioning), equipment
malfunctions, system crashes, etc.
 52                                                    AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011


7.13. USIs Linked to Incidents. If it is discovered during the course of troubleshooting that a
USI was the result of an incident as defined in paragraph 5.4 and Table 5.1, go directly to the
Incident Reporting section (Section 5B) and follow the procedures elaborated within that
section.
7.14. USI Reporting Categories. Four broad categories of reportable assets/services are
defined: Critical Core Service, Core Service, End User Equipment, and Functional System.
Table 7.2 summarizes the four defined reporting categories. NOTE: The AFNOSC will further
elaborate the specific assets and services that fall within each of the defined categories through
the AFNETOPS SPIN-C and daily CTO.

Table 7.2. USI Reporting Categories.

 Category        Description
 Critical Core A core service whose loss or degradation would severely impair the operational
 Service       capability of an entire network enclave. Some examples include, but are not
               limited to, service delivery points and directory services servers.
 Core Service    Core services encompass user services such as E-mail, shared file/data storage,
                 network printing and web services; network management services such as
                 domain name system, network address management, directory services,
                 network boundary protection; and the switched and routed networks that make
                 up the AFEN. NOTE: Refer to AFI 33-115, Volume 1, for the complete
                 definition of Core Services.
 End User        End user equipment includes workstations, printers, peripherals, end building
 Equipment       local area network components, etc.
 Functional      A specific system used, owned, operated, and maintained by a functional
 System          community.


7.15. USI Reporting. Upon detection or notification of a USI, notify the Primary Recipient and
take the actions as outlined in Table 7.3 Table 7.4 specifies the timelines associated with USI
reporting.
AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011                                                              53

Terms
Air Force Enterprise Network (AFEN)—The AFEN is an information environment comprised
of interoperable computing and communication components. The AFEN is part of the Global
Information Grid. Therefore, the AFEN is the interconnected, end-to-end set of information
capabilities, associated processes, and personnel for collecting, processing, storing,
disseminating, and managing information on demand to warfighters, policy makers, and support
personnel. The AFEN includes all owned and leased communications and computing systems
and services, network operating systems, data, security services, and other associated services
necessary to achieve information superiority. (AFI 33-115, Volume 1)
Air Force Network Operations Security Center (AFNOSC)—A command and control entity
composed of the AFNOSC Command and Control Division at Barksdale AFB LA, the AFNOSC
Net Security Division (formerly the Air Force Computer Emergency Response Team) at
 60                                                     AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011


Lackland AFB TX, and the AFNOSC Net Operations Division (formerly the Air Force Network
Operations Center) at Gunter Annex, Maxwell AFB AL. The AFNOSC was created by the Chief
of Staff of the Air Force to ensure and preserve the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of
Air Force networks (voice, video, and data), its information systems, stand-alone computing
devices, and the information contained within those elements respectively. The AFNOSC is
under the leadership of the AFNOSC Director, (8 Air Force Vice Commander) and the
AFNETOPS/CC, (8 Air Force Commander).
Asset—Any device connected to the AFEN. Devices include but are not limited to workstations,
servers, infrastructure components (e.g., router, switch) and networked peripherals (e.g., network
printers).
Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Notice to Airmen (C4 NOTAM)—
C4 NOTAMs are closely related to TCNOs with the primary difference being that they are
informative in nature and are not used to direct actions. They are used by all organizations within
the AFNETOPS hierarchy. They are the primary means for disseminating network information
that does not require specific actions to be taken, or compliance to be tracked. However, in some
cases, acknowledging receipt of a C4 NOTAM may be required. There are four types of C4
NOTAMs: Informative, Scheduled Event, Unscheduled Event, and Summary.
Countermeasures—Action, device, procedure, technique, or other measure that reduces the
vulnerability of an information system. (AFI 33-202)
Designated Approving Authority (DAA)—Official with the authority to formally assume
responsibility for operating an information system or network within a specified environment.
(AFI 33-202)
Enclave—Collection of computing environments connected by one or more internal networks
under the control of a single authority and security policy, including personnel and physical
security. Enclaves always assume the highest mission assurance category and security
classification of the automated information system applications or outsourced information
technology-based processes they support, and derive their security needs from those systems.
They provide standard IA capabilities, such as boundary defense, incident detection and
response, and key management, and also deliver common applications, such as office automation
and electronic mail. Enclaves may be specific to an organization or a mission, and the computing
environments may be organized by physical proximity or by function independent of location.
Examples of enclaves include LANs and the applications they host, backbone networks, and data
processing centers. (AFI 33-202)
End User—An end user is defined as an individual assigned to an organization that uses or
operates any portion of the AFEN, any information system connected to the AFEN, and any
stand-alone computing devices.
Event—Any network activity, whether it is suspicious or not. It includes everything that happens
across the network (e.g., web access, E-mail, file transfer protocol).
Functional System—A specific system used, owned, operated, and maintained by a functional
community. (AFI 33-202)
Functional System Administrator (FSA)—Functional system administrators ensure functional
system servers, workstations, peripherals, communications devices, and software are on-line and
AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011                                                                  61


supported. They must thoroughly understand their customer’s mission and be completely
knowledgeable of hardware and software capabilities and limitations supporting that functional
system. Their area of responsibility is from the user’s terminal to the server, but does not include
the network backbone infrastructure. Functional system administrators are not normally assigned
to the NCC, but are a logical extension of NCC functionality.
Incident—An attempted entry, unauthorized entry, and an information attack on an information
system. It includes unauthorized probing, browsing; disruption, or denial of service; altered or
destroyed input, processing, storage, or output of information; or changes to system hardware,
firmware, or software characteristics with or without the users knowledge, instruction or intent
(e.g., malicious logic). An incident may also involve a violation of law. If a violation of law is
evident or suspected, the incident must also be reported to both security and law enforcement
organizations for appropriate action. Two common incident types are Intrusions and Malicious
Logic. The terms Incident and Security Incident are used interchangeably within DOD guidance
documents but for the purposes of this instruction, the events defined here will be known simply
as Incidents.
Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA)—The IAVA is generated by the DOD
CERT when a vulnerability is the most severe and a corrective action is of the highest priority.
IAVAs are generated when a new vulnerability to a privileged system exists and poses an
immediate threat to the DOD. Because of the priority of the IAVA, acknowledgement and
compliance with the corrective action is tracked and reported by each combatant command,
service, and agency (CC/S/A). The IAVA is one of three types of notification defined by CJCSM
6510.01 within the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) Program. The
other two notifications include Information Assurance Vulnerability Bulletins, and Technical
Advisories.
Information Assurance Vulnerability Bulletin (IAVB)—The IAVB addresses new
vulnerabilities that do not pose an immediate threat to the DOD. However, chain of command
involvement is required because non-compliance with a corrective action could escalate the
threat. CC/S/A acknowledgement of the IAVB is required. The IAVB is one of three types of
notification defined by CJCSM 6510.01 within the IAVM Program. The other two notifications
include Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts and Technical Advisories.
Information Systems Security Manager (ISSM)— Principal advisor on computer security
matters to DAA. (NOTE: DODI 8500.2, Information Assurance (IA) Implementation, February
6, 2003, IA Manager [IAM]). The individual responsible for the information assurance program
of a DOD information system or organization. While the term IAM is favored within the DOD, it
may be used interchangeably with the IA title Information Systems Security Manager (ISSM).
(AFI 33-202)
Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO)—Official who manages the Computer Security
program for an information system assigned to him or her by the ISSM; including monitoring
information system activities, and ensuring that the information system is operated, maintained,
and disposed of according to security policies and practices. (NOTE: DODI 8500.2 IA Officer
[IAO]). An individual responsible to the IAM for ensuring that the appropriate operational IA
posture is maintained for a DOD information system or organization. While the term IAO is
favored within the DOD, it may be used interchangeably with other IA titles (e.g., Information
 62                                                     AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011


Systems Security Officer, Information Systems Security Custodian, Network Security Officer, or
Terminal Area Security Officer). (AFI 33-202)
Intrusion—A type of incident characterized by unauthorized access to an information system.
Malicious Logic—Malicious logic is one type of incident. It expands on what was previously
termed a “Virus” which was primarily defined as a software-driven attack. Malicious logic is
broader in scope. It is defined as the intentional insertion of firmware and software to disrupt the
availability, integrity, or confidentiality of a network, information systems, stand-alone
computing device, and the information they process respectively.
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)—A MAN delivers information (voice, video, data,
imagery, telemetry, and sensory) from a base external service delivery point to the hub servicing
all essential sites within a base and deployed site. It encompasses analog/digital physical and
wireless media (e.g., cable, microwave, infrared), network management and information
protection systems, and infrastructure components (e.g., multiplexers, routers, switches,
repeaters, hubs). The MAN extends from the interface of the user’s terminal to the interfaces of
the base-level host, base-level server, base-level service delivery point, and transmission systems
that provide connectivity to off-base assets. The MAN includes all the base network backbone
infrastructure components.
Mission Support Center (MSC)—MSCs look, feel and act similar to a MAJCOM NOSC but
are assigned to a FOA or DRU. They are responsible to a functional for monitoring network and
application performance to ensure mission accomplishment over and above what is done by the
local NCC. (AFI 33-115, Volume 1)
Program Executive Officer (PEO)—A military or civilian official who has primary
responsibility for directing several Major Defense Acquisition Programs and assigned major
system and non-major system acquisition programs. A PEO only reports to and receives
guidance and direction from the Air Force Acquisition Executive. (AFPD 63-1)
Program Manager (PM)—A military or civilian official responsible for managing an
acquisition program. Also known as a single manager or a system program director.
Program Management Office (PMO)—Within the context of this instruction, a PMO develops,
acquires, and fields technical solutions for Air Force-networks and systems. PMOs exist at the
Air Force and MAJCOM levels.
Security Incident—The introduction of information that is classified above the level that a
network, information system, or stand-alone computing device is authorized to process.
System Program Office (SPO)—Like PMOs, a SPO develops, acquires, tests, fields and
supports Air Force systems throughout their lifecycle. Unlike PMOs, SPOs generally come under
administrative authority of Air Force Materiel Command or Air Force Space Command.
Technical Advisories (TA)—Technical Advisories are generated when new vulnerabilities exist
but are generally categorized as low risk. Advisories are issued because these vulnerabilities
could potentially escalate in the future if not mitigated. The TA is one of three types of
notification defined by CJCSM 6510.01 within the IAVM Program. The other two notifications
include Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts and Information Assurance Vulnerability
Bulletins.
Technique—A means of exploiting a computer or network vulnerability.
AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011                                                                63


Time Compliance Network Orders (TCNO)—TCNOs are downward-directed operations,
security, or configuration management-related orders issued by the AFNOSC or NOSCs. The
TCNO provides a standardized mechanism to issue one ―order‖ amongst
AFNOSC/NOSC/NCCs, telling them how to run and make changes to the AFEN. TCNOs may
be generated internally or in response to an IAVA to direct the implementation of an operational
or security vulnerability risk mitigation procedure or fix action (i.e., software patch).
Unauthorized Result—An unauthorized consequence to an event.
Vulnerability—Weakness in an information system, or cryptographic system, or components
(e.g., system security procedures, hardware design, internal controls) that could be exploited.
(AFI 33-202)
Workgroup Manager (WM)—Workgroup managers support a functional community (e.g.,
work centers, flights, squadrons, or organizations) and serve as the first line of help to resolve
customers’ administrative and technical problems. WMs are usually not assigned to the NCC,
though are logically an extension of the help desk. WMs take direction from the NCC and FSA.
NCC direction takes precedence over FSA direction. WMs install, configure, and operate
client/server devices.

                              TCNO EXTENSION PACKAGES

A4.1. Required Extension Request Information. The extension request will include the
following information (see A4.3 for a sample first extension package and A4.4 for a sample
second extension package):
   A4.1.1. AFNOSC-Assigned TCNO Tracking Number. Include the TCNO number for which
   the extension is being requested. Additionally, if the TCNO is related to an IAVA, IAVB or
   TA, include the IAVA, IAVB, or TA number as well.
   A4.1.2. Vulnerability Description. Include a short description of vulnerability as identified in
   the associated TCNO.
   A4.1.3. Original Compliance Date. List the original compliance date as stated in the TCNO.
   A4.1.4. Extension Type. List the type of extension being requested; i.e., First (0-30 days),
   Second (31-90 days), or Third (91 days through 2 years).
   A4.1.5. Previous Extensions: For second and third extension requests, list the type and
   expiration date of all previously granted extensions.
   A4.1.6. Requested Extension Date. This should be the date the requesting organization
   expects to be compliant.
   A4.1.7. Affected Units/Installations. List the unit and/or location covered by the extension
   (e.g. NOSC plus all subordinate installations).
   A4.1.8. Justification. Explain why the original compliance date, or a previously granted
   extension date cannot be met. It is imperative this justification be as detailed and complete as
   possible. For example, do not simply state, ―The systems are legacy systems and are
   scheduled for replacement in 18 months.‖ Rather, provide complete details, ―The systems are
   Solaris 2.5 legacy systems and the patch procedures outlined in the TCNO cannot be applied.
   When the patch is applied the software package called MapSense will not function.
   MapSense is used by the 121st Squadron to create 3D graphic maps. We have contacted
   MapSense and they state that we would need to upgrade to a current version of Solaris.
   However, our current hardware is Sun MP630 and cannot be upgraded to a more current
   version of Solaris. The Sun MP630 are being replaced and the new systems will be
   completely installed by 15 Sep 2005.‖
   A4.1.9. Risk Mitigation Actions. Describe in detail what actions have been taken or
   processes put in place to mitigate the risk associated with the vulnerability. If some amount
   of the risk can be mitigated through other actions, this will help extension evaluation and
   approval officials assess the residual risk imposed on the AFEN and Air Force information
   systems if the extension is approved. For example, ―These systems communicate with only
   three outside sources using only one protocol. TCP Wrappers have been placed on the
   devices to limit access to the specific protocol. Further, we have placed a router in front of
   the devices and denied all access except the internet protocol (IP) addresses from the three
   input sources.‖ <emphasis emph="bolditalic">NOTE: </emphasis>Do not get so specific as
   to cause the extension request to be classified. For example, in the preceding example, there
AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011                                                                69


   is no need to list the specific protocol or the IP addresses that were being authorized through
   the router.
   A4.1.10. Mission Impact. State any mission that would be degraded or lost if the affected
   workstations are directed to be disconnected from the network. Be as specific as possible. For
   example, ―Removing this system from the network will prevent the 121st Squadron’s ability
   to provide virtual 3D maps for supporting on-going operations.‖
   A4.1.11. Number and Percentage of Non-compliant Workstations. Provide both raw number
   and percentage of total affected workstations that are non-compliant.
   A4.1.12. Method Used to Identify Non-compliant Workstations. Identify the automated or
   manual means that was used to identify affected non-compliant workstations.
   A4.1.13. Supporting Material. Note any vendor or PMO information as well as any
   extenuating factors that will assist the extension approval authority in reaching a decision.
   A4.1.14. POC Information. Include name, phone and E-mail contact information for
   requesting agency POC. For second or third extensions, this POC should be from the
   MAJCOM/FOA/DRU level, not base/wing level.
A4.2. Extension Endorsement. In accordance with Table 3.4, all extension requests must be
endorsed before being forwarded to the extension approval authority. The endorsement will
indicate that the endorsing official:
   A4.2.1. Has evaluated the supporting documentation and concludes that the deployment of
   the recommended fix is not possible within the time frame required by the TCNO or previous
   extension.
   A4.2.2. Has reviewed the mitigation action and believes these actions are sufficient to
   minimize the risk posed to the AFEN until the affected workstations can be brought into
   compliance.
   A4.2.3. Has analyzed the risk that the unfixed but mitigated vulnerability levies and has
   compared the risk to the mission impact if the workstations are ordered disconnected and
   finds that the impact to the supported missions is greatest if the workstations are
   disconnected.
   A4.2.4. Understands the risk is not just to his/her network, but to the whole AFEN.
A4.3. Sample First Extension Request.
                                                                                17 February 2004
MEMORANDUM FOR 123 WG/CC
FROM: 123 CS/CC
SUBJECT: First Extension Request for TCNO AFNOSC 2004-041-001
1. TCNO Number. TCNO AFNOSC 2004-041-001
2. Vulnerability Description. A vulnerability has been identified in the XYZ Library. Successful
exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute code with system privileges
and then take any action on the system, including installing programs, viewing/changing data, or
creating new privileged user accounts.
 70                                                       AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011


3. Original Compliance Date. 23 Feb 2004
4. Extension Type. First extension (additional 30 days)
5. Requested Extension Date. 25 Mar 2004
6. Affected Units. This extension is being requested for all 123 WG units and tenant units
supported by the 123 CS.
7. Justification. Initial automated distribution of the required patch was accomplished on 14
February 2004 and only 60% of the affected workstations were successfully patched. An
additional 15% of the affected workstations were successfully patched during a subsequent
automated distribution of the patch. It has been determined that the automated patch failed on the
remaining non-compliant workstations because they require a service pack to be installed before
the required patch will install successfully. The required service pack must be manually installed
at the workgroup manager level and this process will take several weeks to accomplish on all
remaining affected workstations across the installation.
8. Risk Mitigation Actions. Actions have been taken to mitigate the operational impact to local,
MAJCOM, and the Air Force mission if a vulnerable workstation is exploited by positively
identifying all workstations not patched and developing a quick reaction plan to isolate any
exploited workstations. All of the vulnerable systems are behind the base perimeter defenses and
current Anti-Virus signatures should prevent the exploit before it can reach the vulnerable
workstations.
9. Mission Impact. The impact of disconnecting any single non-compliant workstation is
minimal; however, the impact of disconnecting the 3,267 non-complaint workstations across the
installation would be considerable as the personnel who normally use those workstations would
be unable to conduct their daily duties.
10. Number and Percentage of Non-compliant Workstations. 3,267 (75% of 4,356).
11. Method Used to Identify Non-compliant Workstations. Due to the standard implementation
of Windows 2000 across the installation, all workstations on the installation are affected by this
vulnerability. We are in the process of conducting Internet Security Systems (ISS) scans to
positively identify non-compliant workstations and will run a new scan every three days until
compliance is achieved.

I have reviewed this extension request and have concluded that full compliance with the TCNO
will not be achievable within the compliance date of 23 February 2004 specified in TCNO
AFNOSC 2004-041-001. I have reviewed the mitigation actions taken and am confident the risk
posed to the AFEN and supported operations is less than the negative impact of disconnecting
the 1,089 non-compliant workstations across my installation. I recommend approval of the
extension until 25 March 2004 as requested.

A4.4. Sample Second Extension Request.

MEMORANDUM FOR MAJCOM DAA
FROM: NOSC
SUBJECT: Second Extension Request for TCNO AFNOSC 2004-041-001
1. TCNO Number. AFNOSC TCNO 2004-041-001
2. Vulnerability Description. A vulnerability has been identified in the XYZ Library. Successful
exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute code with system privileges
and then take any action on the system, including installing programs, viewing/changing data, or
creating new privileged user accounts.
3. Original Compliance Date. 23 February 2004
4. Extension Type. Second extension (additional 30 days)
5. Previous Extensions. First extension until 25 March 2004 was granted on 23 February 2004
6. Requested Extension Date. 23 April 2004
7. Affected Units/Installations. This extension is being requested to cover the NOSC and all
subordinate MAJCOM installations and units.
 72                                                    AFI33-138_21SWSUP_I 24 MAY 2011


8. Justification. Initial automated distribution of the required patch was accomplished across the
MAJCOM on 14 February 2004 and 60% of the affected workstations were successfully patched.
An additional 15% were successfully patched during a subsequent automated distribution of the
patch. It has been determined that the automated patch failed on the remaining non-compliant
workstations because they require a service pack to be installed before the required patch will
install successfully. The required service pack must be manually installed at the workgroup
manager level and this process has been underway for several weeks. As of 8 March 2004, 83%
of the workstations across the MAJCOM have been successfully patched but it will take 8 more
weeks to achieve full compliance.
9. Risk Mitigation Actions. Actions have been taken to mitigate the operational impact to local,
MAJCOM, and the Air Force mission if a vulnerable workstation is exploited by positively
identifying all workstations not patched and developing a quick reaction plan to isolate any
exploited workstations. All of the vulnerable systems are behind the base perimeter defenses and
current Anti-Virus signatures should prevent the exploit before it can reach the vulnerable
workstations.
10. Mission Impact. The impact of disconnecting any single non-compliant workstation is
minimal; however, the impact of disconnecting the 8,615 non-complaint workstations across the
command would be considerable as the personnel who normally use those workstations would be
unable to conduct their daily duties.
11. Number and Percentage of Non-compliant Workstations. 8,615 (17% of 50,678).
12. Method Used to Identify Non-compliant Workstations. Due to the standard implementation
of Windows 2000 across the command, all workstations are affected by this vulnerability. We
are running ISS scans every three days to positively verify compliance and to identify non-
compliant workstations.

      INTERIM CHANGE (IC) 2005-1 TO AFI 33-138, ENTERPRISE NETWORK
               OPERATIONS NOTIFICATION AND TRACKING


28 NOVEMBER 2005
OPR: SAF/XCIFN (Maj Sam Arwood)
Certified by: SAF/XCIF (Col Porter Clapp)
This Air Force instruction (AFI) implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 33-1,
Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) Systems; the Information Assurance
Vulnerability Management Program; and incident and vulnerability reporting guidance provided
in Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual (CJCSM) 6510.01, Defense-in-Depth:
Information Assurance (IA) and Computer Network Defense (CND). This instruction prescribes
and explains the various notification and tracking processes required to direct action and report
status throughout the Air Force Network Operations (AFNETOPS) hierarchy. The specific
processes addressed include Time Compliance Network Order (TCNO); Command, Control,
Communications and Computers Notice to Airmen (C4 NOTAM); and incident, vulnerability,
security incident, and service interruption reporting. This instruction applies to all Air Force
military and civilian personnel and to Air Force contractors who develop, acquire, deliver, use,
operate, or manage Air Force information systems. Supplementation of this instruction is
permitted but is not required. If supplements are issued, major commands (MAJCOM), field
operating agencies (FOA), and direct reporting units (DRU) will furnish a copy to Secretary of
the Air Force (SAF/XCIF), 1030 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1030; field units
will furnish a copy to the next echelon of command. This publication applies to the Air National
Guard. Send recommended changes or comments to Headquarters Air Force Communications
Agency (HQ AFCA/EASD), 203 W. Losey Street, Room 1100, Scott AFB IL 62225-5233,
through appropriate channels, using Air Force (AF) IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication, with an information copy to SAF/XCIF. The reporting requirements in this
instruction are exempt from licensing in accordance with AFI 33-324, The Information
Collections and Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency
Air Force Information Collections. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)

with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/rds/index.cfm. See Attachment 1 for a
glossary of references and supporting information.
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2005-01 (Attachment 13) and alters FOA/DRU
reporting directly to the Air Force Network Operations and Security Center (AFNOSC) due to
FOA/DRU NOSC realignment. Mission Support Centers (MSC) will be treated as Network
Control Centers (NCC) for reporting purposes. Multiple tables have been updated to reflect this
conversion. Additional minor administrative corrections were made and office symbols updated.

 Actions
 1    End users will immediately report any suspected or actual malicious logic incident to their
      WM. This includes reporting all virus alerts generated by anti-virus software, whether the
      user believes them to be valid or not. If the WM is unavailable, end users must report the
      event to the next network or computer security professional in the chain of command (i.e.,
      ISSO, ISSM, FSA, etc.)
 2    Remove the malicious logic and gather information from the end user to prepare an MLR.
 3    WM, FSA, ISSO and ISSM will submit an MLR to the servicing NCC. If there is no
      servicing NCC send the MLR directly to the parent NOSC.
 4    For malicious logic events that result in an infection (i.e., the malicious logic was not
      quarantined or eradicated by anti-virus software), the NCC will immediately submit an
      MLR to their parent NOSC and will provide periodic updates to the NOSC until the
      malicious logic has been eradicated.
 5    NOSC will create and update MLR incident records through the Computer Security
      Assistance Program 21st Century Database System (CDS). For those organizations that do
      not have access to CDS, submit final MLRs directly to the AFNOSC via E-mail.
 6    Submit an initial UEC4N to the AFNOSC upon initial notification of a confirmed
      malicious logic infection within their AOR.
 7    Submit an update UEC4N every 24 hours until the malicious logic is eradicated.
 8    Submit a final UEC4N within 24 hours of a malicious logic infection being eradicated.
 9    Send an informational copy of all MLRs to the Informational Recipients indicated.
