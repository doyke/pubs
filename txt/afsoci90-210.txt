                                          Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL OVERVIEW

1.1. AFSOC AFSO21 Vision. A culture of CPI within AFSOC.
1.2. AFSOC AFSO21 Mission. Create/maintain a culture of CPI to enhance AFSOC’s
warfighting capabilities.
1.3. Execution.
   1.3.1. Commander’s Intent: To establish an effective CPI program within AFSOC that
   complies with all Department of Defense (DOD), US Air Force (USAF), and US Special
   Operations Command (USSOCOM) directives and requirements, with the ultimate goal of
   continually improving AFSOC’s warfighting capability.
   1.3.2. This program will:
       1.3.2.1. Recognize the warfighter as the ultimate customer.
       1.3.2.2. Influence every Air Commando, service, and product in AFSOC.
       1.3.2.3. Focus on the fundamental principles and methodologies of AFSO21
       emphasizing the use of:
          1.3.2.3.1. Strategic alignment and deployment (SA&D) tactics.
          1.3.2.3.2. Air Force 8-Step Problem-Solving tools and methodologies.
          1.3.2.3.3. Lean principles and methodologies.
       1.3.2.4. Foster replication and sharing of best practices across AFSOC, increasing the
       effectiveness and efficiency of AFSOC Air Commandos.
1.4. Background. The Secretary of the Defense established a requirement for each service to
implement a CPI program to maximize the United States’ military capability while ensuring the
necessary good stewardship of our nation’s assets and natural resources. DODI 5010.43 directs
and levees requirements on each service to develop a program with specific training, reporting
and integration aspects to support these overarching goals. In response to this DOD directive,
the Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF) directed the service-wide implementation of an AF CPI
program called AFSO21. USSOCOM has implemented a similar CPI program that is managed
through the USSOCOM Office of Strategic Management. AFSOC has a long history of
innovation and process improvement. Recognizing the need for a formal program to ensure all
Air Commandos are fully capable of maximizing all aspects of special operations warfare and
support using CPI methodologies, AFSOC/CC directed the implementation of an AFSOC CPI
program. Under the guidance of AFSOC/CV, AFSOC AFSO21 (AFSOC/CVO) is the office
responsible for the successful implementation of CPI initiatives within AFSOC.

vetting is needed to ensure the correct improvement or problem is being addressed and aligned in
accordance with organizational priorities and goals.

   addressed using AFSO21 methodologies:
       3.1.2.1. Strategic Alignment and Deployment (SA&D).
       3.1.2.2. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) Analysis.

   directorate level. The typical scope of Black Belt events will consist of two or more
   squadrons/divisions or above.
3.3. Checklist. The AFSOC/CVO-approved Team Event Checklist is to be used when
preparing for and conducting an AFSO21 team event. AFSOC/CVO-approved Team Event
Checklist can be found on the AFSOC AFSO21 SharePoint Site or by contacting AFSOC/CVO.
3.4. Standardization.
   3.4.1. Methods used to standardize successful AFSO21 events include, but are not limited to,
   the following: technical order changes, Air Force instruction changes, operating instruction
   changes.
   3.4.2. Communication methods of improvements and results include, but are not limited to,
   the following: CPI-MT, newsletters, practitioner meetings and AFSO21 conferences.
3.5. Reporting. Reporting of AFSO21 Problem-Solving events and CPI efforts will be
accomplished using the AFSOC approved Problem-Solving A3 format.

      continuous process improvement effort is only as good as the problem solvers
      implementing and executing the plan. The AF recognized the need for personnel to be
      schooled in a disciplined, proven problem-solving methodology. In conjunction with the
      University of Tennessee’s Center for Executive Education, the AF developed the 8-Step
      Problem-Solving Workshop, which is the AF standard framework and methodology for
      organizational problem-solving and decision making.
