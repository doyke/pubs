SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction includes thermal stress responsibilities and heat stress guidance for exercise and
real world contingency operations. This instruction supersedes Hill AFB Instruction 15-102,
Cold Weather Working Conditions.
1. Responsibilities.
     1.1. Commanders. Ensure personnel take thermal stress preventive measures during the
     summer and winter months and especially when the Wet Bulb Global Temperature (WBGT)
     index reaches 88F or the wind chill equivalent temperature reaches 0ºF. Apply Operational
     Risk Management (ORM) principles to activities involving high potential for heat or cold
     stress injuries. Establish mission critical tasks based on ORM. Ensure that supervisors are
     enforcing the use of the ―Buddy System‖ when personnel are working outdoors during
     inclement weather (reference Attachment 2).
     1.2. Weather (75 OSS/OSW).
        1.2.1. Weather will issue an Observed Weather Advisory on an automated weather
        dissemination system when the equivalent chill temperature reaches 0F. The advisory
        will be disseminated on the automated system when the condition is first observed. A
        transmission on the automated system will be made noting the end of the criterion. The
        initial and ending advisory messages will be appropriately ―flagged‖ on the automated
        system to alert the receiving organization that an advisory has been issued (reference
        Attachment 3 for notifications). The automated system will display the equivalent chill
        temperature when the ambient temperature is below 40°F and the wind speed is above
        five knots.
        1.2.2. Current wind chill can be found on the Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET)
        homepage. Contact 75 OSS/OSW for JET access. Reference Attachment 4 for
        equivalent chill temperature chart.
     1.3. Bioenvironmental Engineering (75 AMDS/SGPB).
        1.3.1. Monitors the WBGT index May through September. The potential for heat stress
        occurs during the hottest portion of the day (typically between 1400 and 1500 at Hill
        AFB). Based on historical data, Bioenvironmental will monitor from 1300–1600 when
        the expected high is 95°F or greater to comply with AFPAM 48-151. AFPAM 48-151
        recommends a minimum of four measurements be collected.
        1.3.2. Posts      the   results     on     the    Hill     AFB      Share     point    site
        (https://cs.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/Hill/default.aspx) with the current Heat Stress Category.
        1.3.3. Provides guidance on controlling heat and cold stress.
        1.3.4. Takes into account Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) level, HazMat
        Protection level and Field Gear when providing heat stress level.
     1.4. Public Health (75 AMDS/SGPM).
        1.4.1. Provides educational programs and training materials on controlling heat and cold
        stress of individuals and groups. Training includes recognition of the signs and
HILLAFBI48-107 3 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 3


      symptoms and prevention of heat illness and cold injury combined with the maintenance
      of personnel’s general aerobic fitness.
      1.4.2. Follows-up on heat and cold related illnesses.
   1.5. Supervisors.
      1.5.1. Ensure that personnel use the ―Buddy System‖ when working outdoors during
      inclement weather. See Attachment 2 for ―Buddy System‖ information.
      1.5.2. Monitor weather conditions through the Hill AFB website or their directorate,
      tenant control centers or alert offices before and during outdoor activities. If weather
      conditions appear to be unfavorable or deteriorating, supervisors should immediately
      check/ask for weather status. Any supervisor observing outdoor operations that are
      unsafe due to weather conditions will immediately stop operations and ask for
      instructions from the control center or alert office. Supervisors will direct compliance
      with these instructions to make sure all personnel are protected against heat/cold weather
      injuries. See Attachment 4 for Recommended Work-Warming Regimen and Precautions.
      See Attachment 5 for Recommended Work-Rest Regimen and Water Intake for Various
      Heat categories.
      1.5.3. When the equivalent wind chill temperature drops below -20º F, supervisors will
      report the number and location of personnel working outdoors to their control centers and
      alert offices. See Attachment 4 for cold categories and recommended work/rest cycles.
      1.5.4. Personnel Protective Equipment. If applicable, ensure personnel are trained on the
      proper care and use of cooling vest.
   1.6. Fitness Assessment Cell. Ensure outdoor course environmental condition (WBGT or
   wind chill) are evaluated prior to administering the 1.5 mile run test (reference AFI 36-2905,
   Fitness Program).
2. Thermal Stress Guidance for Exercise and Real World Contingency Operations.
   2.1. Commander’s Discretion. Contingency operations may require tasks exceeding
   recommended work/rest cycles (i.e., security forces, Civil Engineer Group rapid runway
   repair, etc.). Commanders and supervisors should apply ORM principles to situations
   involving potentially hazardous heat stress operations (Reference AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear,
   Biological, Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards,
   Attachment 4: Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) Work-Rest Cycle and
   Hydration Charts and AFMAN 32-4005, Personnel Protection and Attack Actions).
   2.2. During Phase I exercises and Emergency Management Responses/exercises, contact the
   75th Aerospace Medicine Squadron, Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (75
   AMDS/SPGB; 777-4551) for assistance with heat stress issues.
   2.3. During Phase II exercises, address heat stress issues to the Preventive Aerospace
   Medicine (PAM) Team at the contingency medical site via the Medical Control Center.
   2.4. Announcing MOPP Heat Stress Work/Rest Cycles: During exercises and contingencies,
   75 AMDS/SGPB or PAM will inform the command post (Emergency Operations Center)
   and/or Incident Commander (IC) and/or Fire Department Safety Officer (SO) of the heat
   stress category, recommended work rest cycle and recommended water intake.

Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) Index Explanation—The Bioenvironmental
Engineering Flight (75 AMDS/SGPB) calculates WBGT index from dry bulb temperature, wet
bulb temperature (i.e., humidity and wind speed), and black globe temperature (i.e., solar load)
readings. When the WBGT index reaches 88F WBGT, high heat stress conditions exist. At 90F
HILLAFBI48-107 3 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                7


WBGT, the risk of heat illness is extreme. NOTE: This is NOT the same as the heat index,
which is an apparent temperature that gives an idea of what it would feel like at low humidity
conditions. The heat index is a function of temperature and relative humidity, but is NOT a good
indicator of heat stress risk.
Wind Chill Temperature (F)—The temperature adjusted for the cooling effect of the wind in a
cold environment. This is calculated using ambient temperature and wind velocity.

A2.1. During periods of adverse weather, personnel working outdoors (exposed to both extreme
heat and cold weather conditions) should perform their duties with a coworker, when authorized
by supervision, to check each other for signs of frostbite, hypothermia, excessive chilling, heat
exhaustion and/or heat stroke.
A2.2. Supervisor/coworker responsibilities include monitoring themselves and others for signs
and symptoms of heat/cold related injury and illness, and ensuring all personnel consume
appropriate amounts of water for the level of work that is being performed.
     A2.2.1. Heat exhaustion. This is caused by loss of body salt and fluids or failure to provide
     the body with an adequate amount of fluids and is a sign that the body is not regulating the
     heat load. Individuals with symptoms of heat exhaustion will have pale, clammy skin;
     headaches; dizziness; clumsiness; irritability; general weakness; and nausea. Remove the
     individual from the heat source and attempt to cool them by having them drink water and
     elevating their legs to ease blood flow to the brain. Since personnel may faint, they should
     be relieved of their duties and taken to a safe area. The signs and symptoms seen in heat
     exhaustion are similar to those of heat stroke, a medical emergency. Give the individual
     fluids slowly and only if they are conscious and are not vomiting. Do not leave them
     unattended at any time. Heat exhaustion can lead to heat stroke and become a medical
     emergency. Seek medical attention immediately.
     A2.2.2. Heat stroke. This occurs when the body can no longer regulate the core temperature
     and results from extreme loss of fluids. Heat stroke is a medical emergency. The primary
     signs and symptoms of heat stroke are confusion; irrational behavior; loss of consciousness;
     convulsions; a lack of sweating; hot, red, dry skin; and an abnormally high body temperature.
     If the body temperature is too high, death will follow. If a worker shows signs of possible
     heat stroke, call 911 immediately. The worker should be placed in a shaded area and the
     outer clothing loosened or removed. Wet or immerse the individual’s body with cool water
     and fan them. Give the individual fluids slowly and only if they are conscious and are not
     vomiting. Do not leave them unattended at any time.
     A2.2.3. Frostbite. The symptoms are loss of feeling in the affected area and a ―dead white‖
     appearance of the affected flesh. Particular attention must be paid to the nose, cheeks, and
     ears for visible signs of frostbite. If frostbite is suspected, obtain medical advice from
     qualified medical personnel immediately.
     A2.2.4. Hypothermia. The symptoms of hypothermia (exposure) are fits of shivering, vague
     and slurred speech, memory lapses, fumbling hands, lurched walk, drowsiness and
     exhaustion, and apparent unconcern about physical discomfort. Personnel are subject to
     hypothermia when exposed to prolong freezing temperatures, but symptoms are usually
     noticed by others before the victim is aware of them. If hypothermia is suspected, medical
     personnel will be contacted immediately, as hypothermia can result in death if untreated.
