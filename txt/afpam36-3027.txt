This pamphlet implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-30, Military Entitlements, and
Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 1300.18, Military Personnel Casualty Matters, Policies,
and Procedures. It describes procedures for the Casualty Services Program for all levels of command and
all Air Force organizations. This publication cannot be supplemented. Refer recommended changes and
conflicts between this and other publications to HQ AFPC/DPWCS, 550 C Street West, Suite 14, Ran-
dolph AFB, Texas 78150-4716 on Air Force Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
This pamphlet provides general information about most federal benefits and entitlements available to eli-
gible family members of deceased Air Force personnel and explains the application process. You can
direct specific questions to the government agency administering the benefits or discuss these matters
with your casualty assistance representative (CAR). If unable to assist you or answer your questions, the
CAR will research the answer and get back with you. Government agencies outside the Air Force admin-
ister most of the benefits discussed in this pamphlet, determine eligibility for such benefits and establish
the amount paid.

Section B—General Information

2. Introduction. This pamphlet is designed to provide general information on most federal benefits and
privileges you may be entitled to as survivors of an Air Force member who died while serving on active
duty (AD), active duty for training (ADT), or inactive duty for training (IDT). In addition, it contains a list
of important documents you should be aware of at Attachment 2 and agencies where you can obtain doc-
umentation on cause and circumstances of death at Attachment 3. Also, an entitlement checklist is pro-
vided for you to record the dates benefits were applied for and received at Attachment 4. After you have
had an opportunity to read this pamphlet, feel free to discuss any questions with your CAR. If they cannot
answer your questions, they will refer you to the appropriate military official or government agency, or
get the answer for you. If you need assistance in other matters not covered in this pamphlet, contact your
CAR.

3. Overview. Casualty assistance to family members includes counseling regarding survivor benefits,
assistance with applications for monetary benefits, and resolving any irregularities or complaints.

Section C—Air Force Mortuary Services Benefits

4. General Entitlements. A mortuary affairs officer will provide mortuary benefits briefing to the next
of kin (NOK) advising of all entitlements and options for the care and disposition of the remains. They
will also furnish a similar pamphlet that deals exclusively with mortuary and funeral details. In the
interim, if you have questions that you feel cannot wait, please call the Air Force Mortuary Office at
1-800-531-5803 at any time 24 hours per day. They will assist until the formal briefing can be adminis-
tered.

Section D—Monetary Benefits

5. General Information. Family members of military personnel who die as a direct or indirect result of
wartime or peacetime service are eligible to receive several types of federal benefits. Benefits to a spouse
and children are paid regardless of economic need, except in the case of a nonservice-connected death
pension, while benefits for parents who might otherwise be eligible will not be paid if the parents have
income in excess of a certain amount each year. Your CAR, the nearest VA or Social Security office will
explain the benefits to you, determine the amounts that can be paid, and help you complete the required
claim forms.

6. Death Gratuity. A lump sum gratuitious payment made by the Air Force to eligible beneficiaries of a
member who dies on AD, ADT, or IDT, or full-time National Guard duty. Its purpose is to help the survi-
vors in their readjustment and to aid them in meeting immediate expenses incurred. The death gratuity
payment is $6,000, of which $3,000 is taxable income. The claim form required to apply for this benefit
is DD Form 397, Claim Certification and Voucher for Death Gratuity Payment. The death gratuity is
not paid to any other person when there are no survivors as listed below. A will is not a legal designation
for death gratuity since such payment is not an allowance or a debt due the member and cannot be part of
the member’s estate. The death gratuity payment is made to survivors of the deceased in this order:
   6.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse. The payment is delivered by the CAR assigned to the
   reporting or assistance base within 24 hours of the member’s death, unless the surviving spouse
   desires other arrangements.
   6.2. When there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member, regardless of age or marital sta-
   tus, in equal shares (state laws guide payment to minor children). DFAS-DE/PMJPC makes payment
   to minor children within 30 days after receipt of DD Form 397 and supporting documentation.
   6.3. If none of the above, to the parents, siblings, or any combination as designated by the deceased
   member. The CAR delivers the payment within 24 hours of the member’s death, unless the NOK
   desires other arrangements.

7. Unpaid Pay and Allowances. Upon death of an active duty member, any pay and allowances due but
not paid to the member, are paid to the designated beneficiary named on the member’s DD Form 93,
Record of Emergency Data. Unpaid pay and allowances may include unpaid basic pay, payment for up
to 60 days of accrued leave, basic allowance for housing for up to 180 days, amounts due for travel, per
diem expenses, transportation of eligible family members, shipment of household goods, and unpaid
installments of a variable reenlistment bonus. DFAS-DE Center will audit the decedent’s pay record and
issue a check for any amount due to the designated beneficiary. The claim form required to apply for this
benefit is Standard Form 1174, Claim for Unpaid Compensation of Deceased Member of the Uni-
formed Services. Your CAR will help you complete the required claim form. When there is no written
designation by the member, any money due is paid to the first eligible recipient in the following order:
   7.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse.
   7.2. If there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member in equal shares, with the share of any
   deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that child.
   7.3. If none of the above, to the parents of the member in equal shares or to the surviving parent.
   7.4. If none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the member’s estate.
8                                                                   AFPAM36-3027 3 OCTOBER 2002


    7.5. If none of the above, to the person(s) determined to be entitled under the laws of the state in
    which the member was domiciled.

8. Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). Eligible family members of deceased active duty members
who die in the line of duty (LOD) are entitled to 180 days of housing allowance or to remain in govern-
ment quarters up to 180 days at no charge. The Air Force conducts a LOD (Misconduct) Determination
Investigation on any deceased active duty member receiving BAH with dependent rate or whose family
members live in or are eligible for government family housing. Eligible family members occupying gov-
ernment housing on the date the member dies may continue to occupy such housing without charge for a
period of 180 days provided the member’s death was in the line of duty. If the family members vacate the
government housing before the 180 days are up, the BAH is paid for the remaining unused days. Eligible
family members not occupying government housing on the date the member dies, may receive BAH and
an overseas housing allowance where applicable, for 180 days provided the member’s death was in the
line of duty. Your CAR will explain this entitlement to you and help you complete the required claim
form.

9. Service Members’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI). Office of Service member’s Group Life Insur-
ance (OSGLI) pays proceeds equal to the amount the member elected and paid. Coverage is automatic to
the maximum allowed by law, unless the member elected a lesser amount or declined coverage in writing.
Monthly premium payments for the level of coverage selected by the member were automatically
deducted from the member’s pay. Determination and payment of proceeds are made by the Office of Ser-
vice members’ Group Life Insurance under the jurisdiction of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
The claim form required to apply for this benefit is VA Form SGLV 8283, Claim for Death Benefits.
Payment of proceeds to a beneficiary is exempt from taxation. The insured member may have designated
as principal or contingent beneficiary any person, firm, corporation or legal entity, including his/her
estate, individually or as a trustee. If the member designated a trust, he/she indicated the name and date of
the trust in the beneficiary block. If the member designated a trust through a will, he/she annotated “Last
Will and Testament” in the beneficiary block. If the member chose not to designate a specific beneficiary
but preferred the proceeds be paid in the order of precedence, the member selected the “By Law” designa-
tion. When the “By Law” designation is used, the proceeds are automatically paid in the following order
of precedence:
    9.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse.
    9.2. If there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member in equal shares, with the share of any
    deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that child.
    9.3. If none of the above, to the parents of the member in equal shares or to the surviving parent.
    9.4. If none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the member’s estate.
    9.5. If none of the above, to the person(s) determined to be entitled under the laws of the state in
    which the member was domiciled.

10. Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). SBP is a monthly annuity paid by the Air Force to the surviving
spouse of a member who dies on active duty whose death is classified in line-of-duty (LOD). The annuity
payable is equal to 55 percent of the retired pay to which the member would have been entitled if retired
with a total disability rating on the date of death. An annuity may also be payable if the member’s death is
classified not in LOD provided the member had completed 20 years of active duty and was qualified for
AFPAM36-3027 3 OCTOBER 2002                                                                                  9


retirement on the date of death. In this case, the annuity payable is equal to 55 percent of the retired pay to
which the member would have been entitled based upon years of active service. If there is no surviving
spouse or the surviving spouse subsequently dies, the annuity is payable to eligible children in equal
shares. Children are eligible as long as they are unmarried and under age 18 (or 22 if a full-time student).
A child, who is disabled and incapable of self-support, remains eligible for life or as long as disabled and
unmarried provided the disability occurred before age 18 (or before age 22 if a full-time student when the
disability occurred). Marriage at any age terminates a child’s eligibility. An eligible child may be an
adopted child, stepchild, grandchild, foster child, or recognized natural child who lived with the member
in a regular parent-child relationship. To qualify, a grandchild or foster child must have been in the care
and custody of the member by court order at the time of death, receiving over one-half of his or her sup-
port from the member and not cared for under a social agency contract. If financial support by other than
the member was court-ordered, it could not exceed one-half of the child’s total support.

11. Reserve Component Survivor Benefit Plan (RCSBP). RCSBP is a monthly annuity paid by the
Air Force to the surviving spouse or, in some cases, eligible children, of an Air Reserve Component mem-
ber who dies and has completed the satisfactory years of service to qualify the member for retired pay at
age 60. The member must have made an election within 90 days of notification of eligibility to participate
in the program. Members on an active Guard/ Reserve 10211 (officer) or 12310 (enlisted) tour, are eligi-
ble to participate in the plan. Coverage is not automatic unless the member dies before the 90-day period
established by law. The initial annuity paid to a surviving spouse is equal to 55 percent of the retired pay
to which the member would have been entitled at age 60, reduced by the Reserve Portion Cost.

12. SBP and RCSBP Factors. SBP is reduced by the amount of the spouse’s monthly Dependency and
Indemnity Compensation (DIC) paid by the VA. The SBP annuity is also reduced to 35 percent when the
surviving spouse reaches age 62. The annuity is payable for the lifetime of the spouse, but is suspended if
the spouse remarries before age 55. A suspended annuity can be reinstated if the subsequent marriage
ends in death or divorce. If the surviving spouse remarries at age 55 or older, the annuity continues. If a
second SBP benefit results from a remarriage, the surviving spouse must elect which of the two SBP ben-
efits to receive. If the surviving spouse remarries prior to age 55 and loses eligibility for the annuity, eli-
gibility does NOT pass to eligible children. It is the annuitant’s responsibility to notify DFAS, with any
change in status that may affect the SBP annuity (i.e., marital status, student status, etc.) by writing to
Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY
40742-7131 or by faxing to 1-800-982-8459.
   12.1. Tax Implications. Survivor annuities are taxable income. You will receive a tax statement from
   DFAS-CL at the end of the year. The statement will show the full amount of the annuity payments you
   received and the total amount of tax withheld during the year.
       12.1.1. Unless you elect otherwise, the amount of federal income tax withheld (FITW) will be as
       if you were a married individual claiming three exemptions. If you want your FITW changed at a
       later date, you must complete a new TD-Form W-4P, Withholding Certificate for Pension or
       Annuity Payments, showing the changes, and mail it to Defense Finance and Accounting Ser-
       vice, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY 40742-7131.
       12.1.2. DFAS-DE withholds a 30 percent federal income tax on annuities paid to nonresident
       aliens unless the beneficiary resides in a country that has a tax treaty with the United States speci-
       fying a different withholding rate. Address questions to the Internal Revenue Service, Assistant
10                                                                  AFPAM36-3027 3 OCTOBER 2002


        Commissioner (International), ATTN: IN:C:TPS, 950 L’Enfant Plaza South, SW, Washington DC
        20024-2123, or contact the nearest American Embassy.
        12.1.3. Annuities may be subject to federal estate taxes. Address tax questions to a legal assis-
        tance officer or the nearest Internal Revenue Service office.
     12.2. A certificate of continued eligibility will be sent to you each year prior to your birthday. Com-
     plete and return the form promptly so DFAS-CL can continue your annuity without interruption. Read
     the instructions on the form and make sure you have completed it correctly. Sign and date the form
     and send it to Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box 7131,
     London KY 40742-7131.
     12.3. Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) Offset. DFAS-DE reduces a surviving
     spouse’s SBP annuity by the amount of DIC the VA awards and pays the surviving spouse. The SBP
     annuity is not reduced by the amount of a child’s DIC entitlement.
     12.4. The claim forms required to apply for this benefit are DD Form 1884, Application for Annuity
     Under the Retired Serviceman’s Family Protection Plan (RSFPP) and/or Survivor Benefit Plan
     (SBP), TD-Form W-4P, Withholding Certificate for Pension or Annuity Payments, and SF 1199A,
     Direct Deposit Sign-Up Form, or FMS Form 2231, FAST START DIRECT DEPOSIT.
     DFAS-DE may require additional documents in order to establish an annuity (i.e., representative
     payee documentation; school certification for full-time student between ages 18 and 22; medical state-
     ment for child disabled before age 18, or before age 22 if a full-time student when the disability
     occurred, etc.).

13. Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). DIC is payable by the VA to surviving spouses,
unmarried children under age 18, disabled children, children between the ages of 18 and 23 if attending a
VA-approved school, and low-income parents of members who die from a disease or injury incurred or
aggravated while on active duty or active duty for training, an injury incurred or aggravated in the line of
duty while on inactive duty training, or a disability otherwise compensable under laws administered by
the VA. DIC is not paid if the VA determines that the member’s own misconduct contributed to the death.
DIC paid to a surviving spouse is not based on the member’s military pay grade. The amount paid for a
spouse with one or more children of the deceased is increased for each child. The amount of the DIC pay-
ment for parents varies according to the number of parents, the amount of their individual or combined
total annual income, and whether they live together or, if remarried, live with a spouse. The surviving
spouse and parents who receive DIC may be granted a special allowance for aid and attendance if a
patient is in a nursing home, disabled, or blind and requires the regular aid and attendance of another per-
son. If they are not so disabled as to require the regular aid and attendance of another person but due to
disability, are permanently housebound, they may be granted additional special allowances. DIC pay-
ments to a surviving spouse are payable for life, as long as the spouse does not remarry. Should the sur-
viving spouse remarry, payments are terminated, but may be restored if the subsequent marriage ends in
death, divorce or annulment. Your CAR or the nearest VA office will explain the benefit to you, the
amount that can be paid, and help you complete the required claim forms.
     13.1. The claim form when applying for this benefit is VA Form 21-534, Application for Depen-
     dency and Indemnity Compensation or Death Pension Accrued Benefits by Surviving Spouse or
     Child, or VA Form 21-535, Application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation by Par-
     ent(s).
AFPAM36-3027 3 OCTOBER 2002                                                                                 11


14. Denial of Claim for DIC. If the VA denies your claim for DIC benefits, you may file an appeal with
the Board of Veterans’ Appeals. The appeal must be filed within 1 year from the date of notification of the
VA decision to file an appeal. The first step in the appeal process is for you to file a written notice of dis-
agreement with the VA Regional Office (VARO) that made the decision. This is a written statement that
you disagree with the VA’s decision. Following receipt of the written notice, the VA will furnish you a
“Statement of the Case” describing what facts, laws and regulations were used in deciding the case. To
complete the request for appeal, you must file a “Substantive Appeal” within 60 days of the mailing of the
“Statement of the Case,” or within 1 year from the date the VA mailed its decision, whichever is later.
Your CAR or the nearest VA office will help you file a written notice of disagreement with the VARO that
made the decision.

15. Nonservice-Connected Death Pension. If the VARO determines that you are not eligible for DIC,
you may be eligible to apply for a nonservice-connected death pension. Surviving spouses of deceased
members with wartime service and unmarried children under age 18, or age 23 if attending a
VA-approved school, may be eligible for this pension if they meet income limitations prescribed by law.
Qualifying children who become incapable of self-support because of a disability before age 18 may be
eligible for a pension as long as the condition exists unless the child marries or the child’s income exceeds
the income limit. The rate of pension depends on the amount of income the surviving spouse or child
receives from other sources. A pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is reason-
able to assume the estate will maintain them financially. The VA will determine your eligibility. Eligible
survivors should visit their local VA office to complete the appropriate claim application.

16. Montgomery GI Bill Death Benefit. If the member contributed to this program, the VA will pay a
special Montgomery GI Bill death benefit to a designated survivor in the event of the service-connected
death of an individual while on active duty. The deceased must either have been entitled to educational
assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill program or a participant in the program who would have been
so entitled but for the high school-diploma or length-of-service requirement. The amount paid will be
equal to the deceased member’s actual military pay reduction less any educational benefits paid. The
death benefit is made in “by-law” fashion to the spouse, children, and parents, and will not be paid to any-
one else in the “By Law” chain. If you are eligible to receive the death benefit, submit a letter, along with
proof of relationship and a copy of the DD Form 1300, Report of Casualty, to the VARO, St. Louis
Regional Processing Officer, ATTN: Chapter 30, Montgomery GI Bill, PO Box 66830, 331/225, St. Louis
MO 63103-6830. Your CAR or the nearest VA office can help you apply for a refund of contributions.

17. Social Security Payments. Social Security monthly benefits are paid to a spouse or a divorced
spouse, age 60 or over; a spouse or divorced spouse regardless of age with children of the decedent under
age 16 or disabled in their care and meeting Social Security requirements. A divorced spouse must have
been married to the service member at least 10 years. Monthly payments are also paid to children until age
18 or 19 if a full-time student at a primary or secondary school or ages 18 or older and disabled before age
18. Spouses who wait until age 65 to apply for Social Security receive maximum benefits. However, they
can receive reduced Social Security payments between ages 60 and 65. Dependent parents are eligible for
benefits at age 62 if they were more than 50 percent dependent on the deceased service member for their
support. The amount paid can only be determined by the Social Security Administration, which has a
record of the wages earned by the member during the period of both military and civilian employment
under the Social Security Program. To apply for this benefit, eligible survivors should make application
through the nearest Social Security office. This office will explain the benefit, determine your eligibility,
12                                                                   AFPAM36-3027 3 OCTOBER 2002


the amount to be paid, and help you complete the required claim forms. You should apply early, as the law
generally permits retroactive payments of 12 months.

18. Social Security Lump Sum Death Payment. The Social Security Administration pays a lump sum
death payment, up to $255, to the surviving spouse living with the member at the time of death. Separa-
tion because of military service, is considered living together. If there is no surviving spouse, it is paid to
the oldest child who was eligible for or entitled to Social Security benefits during the month of the mem-
ber’s death. No other survivors are entitled to this benefit. This benefit is paid even if burial, funeral, or
memorial benefits were paid by the Air Force. To receive this benefit, eligible survivors must make appli-
cation through the nearest Social Security office. This office will explain the benefit, determine your eli-
gibility, the amount to be paid, and help you complete the required claim forms.

Section E—Travel of Eligible Family Members and Shipment of Household Goods

19. Basic Information. Regardless of the decedent’s pay grade, the lawful dependents and their house-
hold goods may be moved at Air Force expense.

20. Space-Available Travel. Upon the death of a member, eligible family members lose all entitlement
to space-available travel.

21. Travel Available to Eligible NOK. Eligible family members of deceased personnel are entitled to
move at Air Force expense to the member’s official home of record, the home of the NOK, or other desti-
nation. This entitlement ends if the move is not completed within 1 year after the service member dies,
unless the Director, Joint Personal Property Shipping Office (JPPSO), 613 Northwest Loop 410, Suite
400, San Antonio TX 78216-5518, approves an extension. This extension must be requested before the
expiration of the 1-year time limitation. The Transportation Management Office (TMO) can provide
assistance in preparing the request for extension. A copy of the DD Form 1300, Report of Casualty, and
an explanation of the reason the extension is required must support it.

22. Shipment of Household Goods. The Air Force pays moving expenses, including shipment of house-
hold goods and one privately owned vehicle. This entitlement ends 1 year after the death unless the Direc-
tor, Joint Personal Property Shipping Office (JPPSO), 613 Northwest Loop 410, Suite 400, San Antonio,
TX 78216-5518, approves an extension of this period. If you are uncertain of your future permanent resi-
dence, your summary court officer will assist you in arranging, through the TMO, for nontemporary stor-
age in the vicinity of where the property is located on the date of death. Once a shipment is effected and
property arrives at the requested destination, further shipment is not authorized.

23. Storage in Transit. Storage in transit may be authorized at Air Force expense for up to 90 days in
connection with any authorized move. This storage is in connection with a shipment of household goods.
When, under certain conditions, the household goods cannot be withdrawn in the first 90 days, a request
for an additional 90 days storage should be made to the TMO controlling your storage account with a brief
explanation for the reason the additional length of time for the storage is required. Temporary storage is
limited to 180 days.

24. Nontemporary Storage. The Air Force authorizes nontemporary storage for a period not to exceed 1
year from the date of death. Furniture may be stored in the vicinity of the place where the property is
AFPAM36-3027 3 OCTOBER 2002                                                                               13


located on the date of death. When property is overseas on the date of death, it will be returned to a Con-
tinental United States (CONUS) port of entry for nontemporary storage. Your summary court officer will
arrange for this storage through the TMO where the property is located.

25. Claims for Loss or Destruction of Personal Property. If there is loss, damage, or destruction of
personal property, the NOK may be entitled to a monetary payment. This includes destruction of property
due to transportation of household goods and personal effects. If you believe you have such a claim, con-
tact the legal claims officer at the nearest military installation for assistance in filing your claims. You
must file a claim within 2 years of discovering the loss or damage.

Section F—Continued Service Benefits and Privileges

26. Basic Information. The loss of your loved one does not mean an end to certain military benefits and
privileges you now receive. You may continue to receive medical care at medical facilities of the Uni-
formed Services, in select former public health hospitals designated by the Department of Defense as Uni-
formed Services treatment facilities, and civilian inpatient and outpatient care, subject to limitations as
determined by local medical authorities. You may use the commissary, base exchange, and morale, wel-
fare and recreation activities, which includes theaters at bases where these facilities are available.
Although every effort is made to provide these benefits and privileges, at some installations the facilities
may be adequate only for the assigned military personnel and their eligible family members. In such
cases, the commander of the installation has the right to deny you the use of those facilities. In some over-
seas areas, the use of Service benefits and privileges may not be extended to families of deceased mem-
bers due to agreements entered into between the United States and the host country. If you plan to travel
or live abroad, let your CAR help you determine the benefits and privileges available in the country where
you plan to live. To determine if you are eligible for any of the Service benefits and privileges mentioned,
read the brief discussion of each below.

27. Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card (ID Card). The ID card is used as a means
of identification to determine eligibility for the following benefits and privileges: health benefits in Uni-
formed Services facilities and from civilian sources, commissary and base exchange privileges, and
admission to morale, welfare, and recreation activities, which include military theaters. Each card shows
the benefits and privileges authorized for the holder and allows the use of these benefits and privileges at
Uniformed Services installations where adequate services and facilities are available. This is the same
type of card you may now have. If this card was issued while the deceased service member was living, it
is no longer valid. You must apply for a new card to show that you are an eligible family member of a
deceased service member rather than of an active duty service member. Your CAR will assist you in com-
pleting a DD Form 1172, Application for Uniformed Services Identification Card-DEERS Enroll-
ment, to obtain your new ID Card. The card is issued to all eligible surviving family members 10 years of
age or over who are eligible for one or more of the Service benefits and privileges mentioned in this pam-
phlet. The card issued to the surviving spouse may identify children under 10 years of age. If the surviving
spouse is deceased or not entitled, the child under age 10 may be issued a separate card.

28. Medical Benefits. Subject to the installation commander’s determination of availability, eligible
family members may receive inpatient and outpatient care, including pharmacy services at Uniformed
Services medical treatment facilities where adequate services and facilities are available. Eligible family
members of active duty members who died while on active duty, and who were on active duty for at least
14                                                                  AFPAM36-3027 3 OCTOBER 2002


30 days before death, will continue to be treated as active duty family members for 3 years after their
active duty sponsor dies. If you remarry someone outside the Uniformed Services, you are no longer cov-
ered. If the marriage is annulled, you may be eligible for reinstatement after the annulment.
     28.1. TRICARE. This is the Department of Defense managed health care program designed to
     improve beneficiary access to care, assure affordable and high-quality care, provide choice, and con-
     tain costs to beneficiaries and the Department of Defense. TRICARE offers eligible family members
     a choice of three health care options, Prime, Extra, and Standard, for seeking care under the TRI-
     CARE program. Each option has different cost-sharing features and degrees of freedom for using
     civilian providers. TRICARE Service Centers are established at or near each military installation to
     assist family members in obtaining care and services as necessary. TRICARE does not cover depen-
     dent parents and parents-in-law; however, they are eligible for care in the military medical treatment
     facility on a space-available basis. For more detailed information on TRICARE, contact the health
     benefits advisor at your nearest medical treatment facility. TRICARE offers the following choices:
        28.1.1. TRICARE Standard. You may use standard Civilian Health and Medical Program of the
        Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), which is known by its new name, TRICARE Standard, in
        which you see the authorized health care provider of your choice, then file a claim, or the provider
        does it for you, for reimbursement by the regional TRICARE contractor. You will be required to
        pay a deductible and co-payment.
        28.1.2. TRICARE Extra. You may use TRICARE Extra, which features healthcare providers
        who are part of an organized network, often known as a “preferred provider organization,” and
        who have agreed to participate in TRICARE for all eligible patients. You get a discount on cost
        sharing, with no claim filing. You don’t have to enroll or pay an annual fee. You do have to satisfy
        an annual deductible for outpatient care, just as you do under TRICARE Standard. On a
        visit-by-visit basis, you can seek care from a provider who is part of the TRICARE Extra Net-
        work, get a discount on services, and pay a reduced cost-share—five percent less than under TRI-
        CARE Standard. Providers will accept the TRICARE allowable charges, or a negotiated fee, as the
        full fee for the care they provide and will file claims for you.
        28.1.3. TRICARE Prime. You may enroll in TRICARE Prime, which is a health maintenance
        organization-type option. Under this plan, which is currently the least costly health care option,
        you must get all of your care from the providers in the organization, for as long as you are
        enrolled. Your care is managed through a primary care manager whom you select or to whom you
        are assigned. Your primary care manager initiates, and the health care finder authorizes, all spe-
        cialty referrals according to TRICARE contractor policies. There are no deductibles or
        cost-shares. Instead, you may pay an annual enrollment fee and small pre-set fees, also called
        co-payments, whenever you visit a clinic, see the doctor, or get a prescription. Additional health
        care benefits, such as preventive medicine service are enhanced benefits of TRICARE Prime and

29. TRICARE-Active Duty Family Members Dental Plan (FMDP). FMDP is an insurance plan that
offers coverage for a wide range of dental services to the enrolled families of active duty sponsors. The
dental plan is not a CHAMPUS program. It provides dental care distinct from the care authorized under
CHAMPUS that provides coverage for services directly related to identified medical conditions. Civilian
dentists provide the care under the FMDP. Either the dentist or the patient may file claims with the civilian
contractor operating the dental plan for the Uniformed Services. Sponsors pay a portion of the monthly

premiums by payroll deduction and pay a cost-share for services provided. If the deceased member was
participating in the FMDP for eligible family members at the time of death, coverage for family members
enrolled is extended for 3 years following the member’s death. For more information about the FMDP,
contact your CAR or the health benefits advisor at your nearest military medical treatment facility.

30. Commissary Privileges. Subject to the installation commander’s determination of availability, the
unmarried surviving spouse is eligible for commissary privileges. He or she may, with approval of the
local installation commander, let an agent make purchases under certain circumstances. All members of
the family living in the house may use purchases.

31. Base Exchange Privileges. Subject to the installation commander’s determination of availability, the
base exchange offers various services and facilities, depending on the base's population and what's avail-
able in the local civilian sector, such as theaters, barber shops, service stations, clothing stores, dry clean-
ing, optical shops, package stores, and other sales stores. The unmarried surviving spouse is eligible for
base exchange services or, with approval of the installation commander, an agent may be allowed to make
purchases under certain circumstances.

32. Lodging. Subject to the installation commander’s determination of availability, eligible family mem-
bers may occupy lodging on a space-available basis when approved by the installation commander. Con-
tact the lodging office to determine the commander's policy and to request accommodations. Family

ability, eligible family members can attend motion picture theaters on military installations. Family mem-
bers must have current ID cards.

34. Recreation Activities: Subject to the installation commander’s determination of availability, as an

Section G—Miscellaneous Rights and Benefits

35. Basic Information. Eligible family members may be entitled to other federal and state rights and
benefits not in this pamphlet. Please read the brief description of each right or benefit. If you think you
may qualify for a benefit and are interested, ask your CAR for more information.

36. Commercial Insurance. For commercial insurance, you should contact the nearest representative or
the home office of the company for settlement. Your CAR can advise you of any insurance allotments that
were being deducted from the member’s pay.

37. Emergency Financial Assistance. The Air Force Aid Society (AFAS) offers qualifying family
members financial assistance in the form of interest-free loans or grants during personal and family emer-
gencies. Aid may be given for such purposes as food, rent, utilities, essential car repair, and certain medi-
cal and dental care. The assistance is temporary and based on immediate need. The assistance is available
through the AFAS section located in the Family Support Center (FSC) at most Air Force bases. If there is
16                                                                  AFPAM36-3027 3 OCTOBER 2002


no AFAS office near you, the AFAS has cross-servicing assistance agreements with the American Red
Cross, Army Emergency Relief, and the Navy/Marine Corps Relief Society. Ask your CAR for additional
details, or contact the base FSC.

38. Legal Assistance. Eligible family members may need or wish to obtain legal advice and assistance in
connection with settling the estate of the deceased member, making a new will for the surviving spouse,
taxation questions, and other related legal matters. Your CAR and mortuary affairs officer may put you in
contact with a legal assistance officer who can counsel you in these matters. The legal assistance officer
can help in preparing the initial income tax return but can only give preliminary advice on probate and set-
tlement of the estate, court appearances, preparation of inheritance tax returns, or in regard to civilian
employment and business matters. Since these matters are outside the scope of the Legal Assistance Pro-
gram, it may be necessary for survivors to obtain the services of civilian counsel. If you are not acquainted
with an attorney and want help in obtaining one, the legal assistance officer can refer you to such counsel
through the local bar association. Government agencies, such as the VA, Social Security Administration,
and the DFAS-DE Center will help you in processing your claims for benefits and entitlements. Such mat-
ters are expeditiously handled without resort to civilian counsel or expense to you. In case of factual dis-
putes or conflicting claims, it might be wise to have civilian counsel.

39. Civil Service Job Preference. A surviving spouse may be eligible to receive 10-point veterans’ ser-
vice preference for federal service employment if the deceased member served in wartime or in a peace-
time campaign or expedition for which the member received a campaign badge or service medal. You can
obtain information about this point preference and available federal employment from a federal Civilian
Personnel Office.

40. State Benefits. Many states have passed laws providing certain rights, benefits, and privileges to the
surviving spouse and children of the deceased service member. These benefits include bonuses, educa-
tional assistance, employment opportunities, tax relief, and others. Seek further information on the laws
pertaining to a particular state from local government officials, the nearest VA office, or from local veter-
ans’ organizations, such as the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Disabled American Vet-
erans.

41. Income Tax Benefits. You may wish to contact the nearest office of the Internal Revenue Service for
information and guidance regarding your federal tax status. Excluded from gross income for income tax
purposes are: Social Security benefits; $3,000 of the death gratuity; burial benefits; VA pension and com-
pensation payments; property, including cash money received as a gift under will provisions; and face
amount of all life insurance policies.

42. Air Force Village Foundation. The Air Force Villages I and II, in San Antonio, Texas, provide
financial support and homes to widows and widowers of Air Force active and retired officers who would

62 or over to become a permanent resident. The Villages also offer a furnished apartment to a surviving
spouse and children for up to a year to gather their lives following the death of an officer. For additional

ried and children of members who died from a service-connected injury or illness. Benefits may be
awarded for pursuit of associate, bachelor or graduate degrees at colleges and universities, including inde-
pendent study, cooperative training and study abroad programs. Courses leading to a certificate or

include full-time National Guard duty. AD for Air National Guard is always performed in a Title 10
United States Code (U.S.C.) federal status. Active duty includes active duty for training and active duty
other than for training.
Active Duty for Training (ADT)—A tour of active duty which is used for training members of the
Reserve components to provide trained units and qualified persons to fill the needs of the Armed Forces

under orders that provide for return to non-active status when the period of active duty for training is
completed. It includes annual training, special tours of active duty for training, school tours, and the initial
duty for training performed by nonprior service enlistees. ADT for Air National Guard is always
performed in a Title 10 U.S.C. federal status and may be referred to as annual training, special training,
formal school training, and initial active duty for training. Active duty for training can be training under
Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12301(b). This duty may satisfy the requirement for an individual to perform 15
days of active service for training per fiscal year.
Active Duty Other than for Training—A category of active duty used to provide Reserve component
support to either active component or Reserve component missions. It includes the categories of active
duty for special work, active Guard/Reserve duty in Title 10 U.S.C. status, and involuntary active duty in
accordance with Title 10 U.S.C. Sections 12301, 12302, and 12304. Training may occur in the conduct of

review; inform your CAR of any errors. The DD Form 1300 is used to provide an official record of the
death of a military member. You may use this in place of a civilian death certificate when proof of death
is necessary. Government agencies and most commercial life insurance companies use the DD Form 1300
as the basis for paying benefits. It may be used to facilitate the cashing of bonds or in the settlement of any
other claim in which proof of death is required. You may obtain additional copies by calling your CAR.

Full-Time National Guard Duty (FTNGD)—Training or other duty, other than inactive duty,
performed by a member of the Air National Guard of the United States under Title 32 U.S.C. Sections
316, 502, 503, 504, or 505. FTNGD does not include inactive duty training. FTNGD is always performed
in Title 32 U.S.C. State status and may only be performed in the United States to include Alaska and
Hawaii, and United States territories. FTNGD is the Title 32 equivalent of active duty. It includes active
Guard/Reserve duty; annual training, special training, formal training, and active duty for special work

which they are assigned with or without pay. This includes those duties performed by members of the Air
National Guard, but does not include work or study in connection with a correspondence course.
Mortuary Affairs Officer—Plans and executes all mortuary affairs programs. Provides guidance to
facilitate the conduct of all mortuary programs and to maintain data (as required) pertaining to the search
for, recovery, identification, preparation, and disposition of remains of persons for whom the Services are
responsible by status and Executive Order. Serves as the central clearing point for all mortuary affairs and
monitors the deceased and missing personal effects program.
Next of Kin (NOK)—A member’s relatives; specifically, the person most closely related to the service
member. The order in which the family relationship is recognized by law is spouse, son or daughter, father
or mother, brother or sister, and grandfather or grandmother. Parents or legal guardians exercise the rights
of minor children. NOTE: Notify a remarried spouse of a missing member if the Air Force recovers the
remains (see 37 U.S.C. Section [f]). Don't notify a former spouse who obtained a divorce from the
member or who remarried before the Air Force issued a finding of death pursuant to Title 37 U.S.C. The
Air Force identifies the next of kin in this order:

Spouse.
Natural, adopted, and stepchildren. Illegitimate children if acknowledged by the member or so determined
by a court.

6.2. When there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member, regardless of age or marital status, in
equal shares (state laws guide payment to minor children). DFAS-DE/PMJPC makes payment to minor
children within 30 days after receipt of DD Form 397 and supporting documentation.


10. Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). SBP is a monthly annuity paid by the Air Force to the surviving spouse
of a member who dies on active duty whose death is classified in line-of-duty (LOD). The annuity payable
is equal to 55 percent of the retired pay to which the member would have been entitled if retired with a
total disability rating on the date of death. An annuity may also be payable if the member’s death is clas-
sified not in LOD provided the member had completed 20 years of active duty and was qualified for
retirement on the date of death. In this case, the annuity payable is equal to 55 percent of the retired pay to
which the member would have been entitled based upon years of active service. If there is no surviving
spouse or the surviving spouse subsequently dies, the annuity is payable to eligible children in equal
shares. Children are eligible as long as they are unmarried and under age 18 (or 22 if a full-time student).
A child, who is disabled and incapable of self-support, remains eligible for life or as long as disabled and
unmarried provided the disability occurred before age 18 (or before age 22 if a full-time student when the
disability occurred). Marriage at any age terminates a child’s eligibility. An eligible child may be an
adopted child, stepchild, grandchild, foster child, or recognized natural child who lived with the member
AFPAM36-3027 3 OCTOBER 2002                                                                                 33


in a regular parent-child relationship. To qualify, a grandchild or foster child must have been in the care
and custody of the member by court order at the time of death, receiving over one-half of his or her sup-
port from the member and not cared for under a social agency contract. If financial support by other than
the member was court-ordered, it could not exceed one-half of the child’s total support.


12. SBP and RCSBP Factors. SBP is reduced by the amount of the spouse’s monthly Dependency and
Indemnity Compensation (DIC) paid by the VA. The SBP annuity is also reduced to 35 percent when the
surviving spouse reaches age 62. The annuity is payable for the lifetime of the spouse, but is suspended if
the spouse remarries before age 55. A suspended annuity can be reinstated if the subsequent marriage
ends in death or divorce. If the surviving spouse remarries at age 55 or older, the annuity continues. If a
second SBP benefit results from a remarriage, the surviving spouse must elect which of the two SBP ben-
efits to receive. If the surviving spouse remarries prior to age 55 and loses eligibility for the annuity, eli-
gibility does NOT pass to eligible children. It is the annuitant’s responsibility to notify DFAS, with any
change in status that may affect the SBP annuity (i.e., marital status, student status, etc.) by writing to
Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY
40742-7131 or by faxing to 1-800-982-8459.


12.1. Tax Implications. Survivor annuities are taxable income. You will receive a tax statement from
DFAS-CL at the end of the year. The statement will show the full amount of the annuity payments you
received and the total amount of tax withheld during the year.


12.1.1. Unless you elect otherwise, the amount of federal income tax withheld (FITW) will be as if you
were a married individual claiming three exemptions. If you want your FITW changed at a later date, you
must complete a new TD-Form W-4P, Withholding Certificate for Pension or Annuity Payments,
showing the changes, and mail it to Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant
Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY 40742-7131.


12.2. A certificate of continued eligibility will be sent to you each year prior to your birthday. Complete
and return the form promptly so DFAS-CL can continue your annuity without interruption. Read the
instructions on the form and make sure you have completed it correctly. Sign and date the form and send
it to Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY
40742-7131.


45. Air Force Enlisted Foundation, Inc. (formerly the Air Force Men’s Widows’ and Dependents’
Home Foundation). Provides housing and services for widowed spouses over age 55 of Air Force
enlisted members. Younger applicants in need, whose sponsor dies or is killed on active duty may be
admitted for up to 1 year. Dependent parents of active duty members are also eligible for permanent resi-
dency. Financial assistance is available for those who qualify. For more information, call 1-800-258-1413,

AFPAM36-3027 3 OCTOBER 2002                                                                                 37


Active Air Force—Members of the Air Force, United States Air Force Academy Cadets, and Air
National Guard and United States Air Force Reserve members serving on extended active duty (i.e., they
are assigned to an active duty unit and their accountability is against active force strength).
Active Duty (AD)—Full-time duty in the active Military Services of the United States. This includes
members of the Reserve components serving on active duty or full-time training duty, but does not
include full-time National Guard duty. AD for Air National Guard is always performed in a Title 10
United States Code (U.S.C.) federal status. Active duty includes active duty for training and active duty
other than for training.
Active Duty for Training (ADT)—A tour of active duty which is used for training members of the
Reserve components to provide trained units and qualified persons to fill the needs of the Armed Forces
in time of war or national emergency and such other times as national security requires. The member is
under orders that provide for return to non-active status when the period of active duty for training is com-
pleted. It includes annual training, special tours of active duty for training, school tours, and the initial
duty for training performed by nonprior service enlistees. ADT for Air National Guard is always per-
formed in a Title 10 U.S.C. federal status and may be referred to as annual training, special training, for-
mal school training, and initial active duty for training. Active duty for training can be training under Title
10 U.S.C., Section 12301(b). This duty may satisfy the requirement for an individual to perform 15 days
of active service for training per fiscal year.
Active Duty Other than for Training—A category of active duty used to provide Reserve component
support to either active component or Reserve component missions. It includes the categories of active
duty for special work, active Guard/Reserve duty in Title 10 U.S.C. status, and involuntary active duty in
accordance with Title 10 U.S.C. Sections 12301, 12302, and 12304. Training may occur in the conduct of
active duty other than for training. Active duty other than for training in support of the active component
is usually supported by military personnel appropriation man-days.
Active Service—Service on active duty or full-time National Guard duty.
Annuity—The monthly or annual payment a beneficiary receives.
Beneficiary—The individual who is entitled to receive certain benefits either by law or written designa-
tion of the servicemember.
Casualty Assistance Representative (CAR)—The person at the nearest Air Force installation responsi-
ble for reporting deaths and assisting survivors.
Death Certificate (Military)—The official DD Form 1300, Report of Casualty, published by Head-
quarters, United States Air Force. As an NOK or beneficiary, you will receive copies of the DD Form
1300 to review; inform your CAR of any errors. The DD Form 1300 is used to provide an official record
of the death of a military member. You may use this in place of a civilian death certificate when proof of
death is necessary. Government agencies and most commercial life insurance companies use the DD
Form 1300 as the basis for paying benefits. It may be used to facilitate the cashing of bonds or in the set-
tlement of any other claim in which proof of death is required. You may obtain additional copies by call-
ing your CAR.
Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Denver Center (DFAS-DE)—The agency that administers
all active duty Air Force pay accounts.
Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Cleveland Center (DFAS-CL)--The agency that adminis-
ters U. S. military retiree and annuitant pay accounts.

Department of Veterans Affairs—The agency that administers all VA programs and survivors’ annu-
ities.
Escort—A military member appointed by the installation mortuary affairs office to accompany the
remains of an active duty member. The escort ensures the transportation arrangements are complete, safe-
guards the remains during transit, and acts as a representative for the Air Force. He or she also assists the
family in completing reimbursement documents.
Eligible Family Members—Generally applies to spouse, children (including step, adopted, and illegiti-
mate children where paternity is acknowledged), and parents.
Family Liaison Officer (FLO)--A military volunteer, appointed by the commander, to assist the surviv-
ing family with the array of support agencies involved in providing assistance following the death of a
member. The FLO acts as the official link between the family and the Air Force until an accident investi-
gation board is complete or the family no longer wants unsolicited contact.
Full-Time National Guard Duty (FTNGD)—Training or other duty, other than inactive duty, performed
by a member of the Air National Guard of the United States under Title 32 U.S.C. Sections 316, 502, 503,
504, or 505. FTNGD does not include inactive duty training. FTNGD is always performed in Title 32
U.S.C. State status and may only be performed in the United States to include Alaska and Hawaii, and
United States territories. FTNGD is the Title 32 equivalent of active duty. It includes active Guard/
Reserve duty; annual training, special training, formal training, and active duty for special work per-
formed in a Title 32 U.S.C. State status. This duty may satisfy the requirement for an individual to per-
form 15 days of active service for training per fiscal year. See Title 10 U.S.C., Section 101(d)(5).
Inactive Duty Training (IDT)—Duty prescribed for members of a Reserve component including a
Training Period (TP), a 4-hour period of training duty, or instruction. IDT also includes a Unit Training

tion, and any special additional duties authorized for Reserve component personnel by the Secretary con-
cerned, and performed by them in connection with the prescribed activities of the organization in which
they are assigned with or without pay. This includes those duties performed by members of the Air
National Guard, but does not include work or study in connection with a correspondence course.

responsible by status and Executive Order. Serves as the central clearing point for all mortuary affairs and
monitors the deceased and missing personal effects program.
Next of Kin (NOK)—A member’s relatives; specifically, the person most closely related to the service-
member. The order in which the family relationship is recognized by law is spouse, son or daughter, father
or mother, brother or sister, and grandfather or grandmother. Parents or legal guardians exercise the rights
of minor children. NOTE: Notify a remarried spouse of a missing member if the Air Force recovers the
remains (see 37 U.S.C. Section [f]). Don't notify a former spouse who obtained a divorce from the mem-
ber or who remarried before the Air Force issued a finding of death pursuant to Title 37 U.S.C. The Air
