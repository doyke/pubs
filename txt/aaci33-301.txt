SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This instruction has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

1. Purpose and Frequency. The Eglin Official Bulletin is the official bulletin for Eglin AFB. It
is published every Friday and the link sent to all users over e-mail. It is the primary means for
disseminating official information of a temporary nature (temporary announcements, notices and
instructions of interest affecting large numbers of personnel) and informational (nondirective)
notices to all personnel. Official material of a permanent nature must be published in a standard
publication following appearance in the bulletin.
2. Policy.
     2.1. Information that can be more properly disseminated by memorandum (for example,
     lengthy items or those intended for a smaller audience) will not be published.

     2.2. Items accepted for publication in the bulletin are subject to editorial review.
     2.3. Meeting announcements for private organizations (activities as authorized in AFI 34-
     223, Private Organization (PO) Program) will be limited to meetings held on base and
     those of general interest to Eglin personnel. Off-base activities, such as school booster
     clubs, local churches or similar activities not directly related to Eglin, will not be published.
     2.4. Items will not be repeated unless specifically requested and justified by the OPR
     (required by directive, mission impact, etc) and will normally not be repeated more than
     once after initial announcement.
     2.5. All items must be approved by the appropriate approval level for the information
     contained in the bulletin item. For example, an office closure item should have approval of
     the individual authorized to close the office. Individuals are responsible for ensuring they
     have approval of the appropriate level within their organization before submitting an item
     for publication. Items announcing base special events (festivals, fund drives, etc) as
     outlined in AFI 36-3101, Fundraising Within the Air Force, changes in hours of operation
     of base facilities or base policy must be approved by the Commander, 96th Air Base Wing,
     or authorized representative.
     2.6. Pictures, drawings, cartoons, etc, will not be placed in the bulletin.
     2.7. Basic information on awards and names of award winners may be published in the
     bulletin. Content should be concise. Lists of nominees will not be published.
     2.8. Informational items for organizations that have their own specific electronic bulletin
     pages will not be published in the Eglin Official Bulletin.
     2.9. Bulletins will be numbered sequentially, beginning with number 1 each calendar year,
     and will contain the Julian date, day of the week and calendar date.
3. Responsibilities.
     3.1. All active-duty military members and civilian employees are responsible for reading
     and complying with applicable official items published in the bulletin. Active-duty
     members will ensure their dependents comply with items as appropriate.
     3.2. The chief of each activity or the unit commander will ensure the bulletin is available to
     all personnel in the activity. If printed copies are necessary to ensure all personnel have
     access to the bulletin, a minimum number of copies should be posted on bulletin boards or
     circulated.
     3.3. Individuals submitting official or informational items for publication are responsible
     for ensuring the item has been properly coordinated and approved for publication, as
     outlined in paragraph 2.5.
     3.4. Personnel of the Publications and Forms Management Office (96 CS/SCSSI) will
     ensure items submitted for publication conform to the requirements of this instruction.
     They will adjust the date of publication, if necessary, and compile, edit and prepare a final
     copy for electronic transmission.

Board and then Eglin Official Bulletin.
