                                              Chapter 1

                                         INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. To provide Joint Forces Headquarters (JFHQ) and ANG units with policy,
guidance and direction on the ANG Human Resources Advisor (HRA) Program. Direction and
success of the program are dependent upon accountability and proper utilization of the positions
as authorized under the Human Resources Advisor Program. This instruction is developed as a
guide for the command function.
1.2. Scope. The Director of ANG Diversity Operations (NGB/CFD) will establish primary
duties for a Program Manager and procedures for additional positions at subordinate levels. The
Director and a Human Resources selection board will determine the selection and tour length of
the Program Manager. The Program Manager serves as the functional manager for all Air
National Guard Human Resources Advisor positions assigned to JFHQs in states, territories, and
the District of Columbia, and 88 wings. Each ANG headquarters for states, territories, District of
Columbia, and wing is authorized one HRA, who will assume leadership in advising
Commanders in Diversity, Personnel Force Development, and personnel Force Management
issues. (See Paragraph 1.3)
     1.2.1. The Air National Guard Diversity Committee (ANGDC) provides direction, guidance,
     strategy and support for the HRA program. The Program Manager validates the appointed
     HRAs to ensure compliance with ANG Manpower requirements. Under AFPD 36-70,
     Diversity, and AFI 36-2706, Equal Opportunity Program, Military and Civilian, both the
     diversity and Equal Opportunity programs are tasked with removing barriers to equal
     opportunity within the areas of recruitment, retention and promotion for military members
     and civilian employees, thereby enhancing performance and mission readiness. Through
     these combined actions, ANG membership will reflect the best of the communities in which
     we serve.
1.3. Program Guidelines. HRAs advise and assist ANG senior leadership on strategic
initiatives that directly affect organizational culture and on the development and effective
utilization of all Airmen in the ANG.
     1.3.1. Diversity. HRAs are charged with helping increase mission readiness through
     statistical analysis of the organization and using the results of that analysis to deploy training,
     promote mentorship, communicate programmatic information, and report results to the senior
     leadership of the organization. Effective strategies include participating in the deliberate
     development of Airmen from accession to positions of leadership and to increase retention
     rates of the highest quality personnel. Diversity, which includes everyone, focuses on the
     organization and its people and purports that differences add value to the entire organization
     and contribute to effective mission accomplishment.
     1.3.2. Personnel Force Development. Advise and assist in the professional development of
     Airmen who will collectively leverage the cumulative strengths of the Air National Guard.
     This process provides leadership focus at all levels in an Airman’s career. Those leaders can
     only be created through an iterative process of development involving education, training,
     and expeditionary operations seasoned with experience and ongoing mentoring by more
     experienced leaders.
ANGI36-2110 28 OCTOBER 2011                                                                       5


   1.3.3. Personnel Force Management. Advise and assist in the defined life cycle for the
   management of human resources covering the point at which recruits enter military service,
   their preparation and training for contributing meaningful service, their continuous
   motivation and, finally, their formal release from military service with honor and dignity.
   1.3.4. Cultural Change. HRAs are cultural change agents and as such are challenged to
   positively affect all members of their organizations. They must fully accept the need for
   change and communicate that need throughout the entire organization. Additionally they
   must work with key partners to create and maintain an open, receptive and respectful
   environment. They will almost certainly encounter resistance to changing established values,
   so they must be astute at garnering support and commitment as directed by their
   commanders. This requires HRAs to possess extraordinary persuasive skills and a high level
   of emotional intelligence. This skill set includes the ability to communicate, to listen, to
   understand and to take into account the doubts of others.
1.4. Program Responsibilities. Responsibilities of the ANG Office of Diversity Operations
and the HRA Program Manager is to develop and implement training guidelines, policies and
procedures that affect the HRA Program and its authorized positions and continuously monitor
and evaluate the program for overall effectiveness. HRA Program Manager will validate

Terms
Air National Guard (ANG)—The Federally recognized militia (air component) of each state,
the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam.
Diversity—(Air Force definition) A composite of individual characteristics, experiences and
abilities consistent with the Air Force Core Values and the Air Force Mission. Air Force
Diversity includes but is not limited to: personal life experiences, geographic background, socio-
economic background, cultural knowledge, educational background, work background, language
abilities, physical abilities, philosophical/spiritual perspectives, age, race, ethnicity and gender.
Diversity encompasses:
(1)    Demographic Diversity—inherent or socially defined personal characteristics, including
age, race/ethnicity, religion, gender, socioeconomic status, family status, disability, and
geographic origin
ANGI36-2110 28 OCTOBER 2011                                                                     25


(2)     Cognitive/Behavioral Diversity—differences in styles of work, thinking, learning and
personality.
(3)     Organizational/Structural           Diversity—organizational/institutional    background
characteristics affecting interaction, including Service, component, and occupation/career field.
(4)     Global Diversity—intimate knowledge of and experience with foreign languages and
cultures, inclusive of both citizen and non-citizen personnel, exchange officers, coalition
partners, and foreign nationals with whom we interact as part of a globally engaged Air Force.
Note(s):—This concept of Diversity is to be tailored as specific circumstances and the law
require.
Air Force Diversity initiatives complement, but remain separate and distinct from Air Force
Equal Opportunity and compliance programs/activities. Air Force Diversity is voluntary and
grounded on building equity and mutual respect among all personnel.
Equal Opportunity—It is against AF policy (AFPD 36-27, Equal Opportunity) for any Airman,
military or civilian, to unlawfully discriminate against, harass, intimidate or threaten another
Airman on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic
information, reprisal or any other non-merit factors prohibited by statute, regulation, or
Executive Order.
Mentor—A trusted counselor or guide, normally a senior person with a professional relationship
to someone less experienced. A mentor is a counselor, coach, motivator, and/or role model.
Someone who has a sincere desire to enhance the success of others and volunteers time to help a
mentee.
Military Compatibility—The condition in which the duties and responsibilities of a military
technician’s position are substantially equivalent to the duties and responsibilities of the
technician’s military assignment.
Personnel Force Development—Advise and assist in the professional development of Airmen
who will leverage the collective strengths of the Air National Guard. This process provides
leadership focus at all levels in an Airman’s career. Leaders at all levels can only be created
through an iterative process of development involving education, training, and expeditionary
operations seasoned with experience and ongoing mentoring by more experienced leaders.
Personnel Force Management—Advise and assist in the defined life cycle for the management
of human resources covering the point at which recruits enter military service, their preparation
and training for contributing a meaningful service, their continuous motivation and, finally, their
formal release from military service with honor and dignity.
