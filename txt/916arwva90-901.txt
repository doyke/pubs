                 RM is asking yourself, “what were you thinking”, before you say, “watch this.”
       I am available to every commander and supervisor to advise you on how to mitigate risk
       in your unit, while accomplishing the mission. Please contact me at 722-4088 for
       assistance implementing RM in your unit’s daily activities.
