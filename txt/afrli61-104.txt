SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. References to
the Systems Engineering (SE) Council (SEC) have been removed, and introduces the SE and
Program Management (PM) Council (SEPM Council), paragraph 2. It assigns overall SE
responsibility in AFRL to the Director (DoE) of the AFRL Engineering and Technical
Management Directorate, paragraph 2. Attachments have been moved to the AFRL SE
Guidebook, a non-directive companion to this instruction.
1. Overview. This instruction defines the S&T SE process as derived from the SE processes of
the Defense Acquisition Guidebook (DAG) and outlines roles and responsibilities of key AFRL
personnel in the tailored application of SE principles and fundamentals at every level of research
and development (R&D). It applies to all AFRL organizations and subordinate units; however,
the director of AFOSR is granted waiver authority for AFOSR.
    1.1. Each TD must document their tailored application of the S&T SE process in a TD–
    specific operating instruction (OI) or supplement to this instruction (See paragraph 2.4.6).
    Each TD Director is granted waiver authority for any Basic Research programs, budget
    category 6.1 or externally funded regardless of funding source, and any Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) programs performed in his/her TD.
    1.2. The primary objective of the AFRL S&T SE process is to ensure that the right technical
    content and execution rigor are applied across the entire AFRL S&T portfolio. To support
    this objective, the specific goals for application of SE within AFRL are:
       1.2.1. Tailor application of S&T SE to the maturity of the technology under development
       across the portfolio.
       1.2.2. Use strong and consistent technical and technical management processes to
       translate capability needs into S&T concepts and/or technologies for development.
       1.2.3. Ensure repeatability of S&T results.
       1.2.4. Consistently deliver technology deliverables that provide “best value” solutions to
       needed war-fighting capabilities.
       1.2.5. Successfully transition technology and knowledge to our customers.
2. Roles and Responsibilities.
    2.1. Commander (AFRL/CC). This instruction constitutes the Commander’s appointment of
    the AFRL Director of Engineering (DoE) as the AFRL Technical Engineering Authority
    (TEA) in accordance with (IAW) AFMCI 63-1201. The Commander will:
       2.1.1. Provide policy guidance and resources for the implementation and application of
       the AFRL S&T SE process.
       2.1.2. Promote the tailored application of systems engineering, airworthiness,

       2.7.5. Maintain the design and/or product baseline for development assets that may
       remain with an operational user.
3. S&T Systems Engineering Process. The S&T SE process is the process by which AFRL
Scientists and Engineers (S&Es) decompose scientific research objectives to knowledge, or
capability needs to technology alternatives. S&T SE also enables innovation by providing a
framework that guides the researcher to develop technology efforts capable of supporting current
or potential future operational needs. The eight DAG SE technical management processes and
the eight DAG SE technical processes are foundational to the S&T SE process. The eight
technical management processes are performed continuously and concurrently while the eight
technical processes are performed sequentially, although with considerable iteration and
feedback checking, throughout the S&T program. See the accompanying AFRL SE Guidebook
for details.
    3.1. One framework for implementation of the principles and fundamentals of the SE
    process on AFRL S&T programs is depicted below. If a TD elects to use an alternative
    implementation framework in lieu of the one presented here, the TD framework must be
    specified in the TD-specific OI or supplement along with a demonstration that the TD
    framework is consistent with the S&T SE framework.

4. Assessment of S&T SE Application.
   4.1. A macro view of the health of the application of an S&T SE process can be attained
   through a series of questions developed from the DAG processes. TD Directors ensure the
   use of these questions to assess the sufficiency of the SE process on a particular S&T
   program during currently existing internal reviews such as laboratory management reviews
   and program management reviews. See the accompanying AFRL SE Guidebook for
   examples of assessment standards for each of the SE key questions tailored for application
   across all phases of technology development from Basic Research through transition to an
   end user. The SE key questions are:
       4.1.1. Who is your customer?
       4.1.2. What are the customer’s requirements?
       4.1.3. How will you demonstrate you have met the requirements?
       4.1.4. What are the technology options?
       4.1.5. Which is the best approach?
       4.1.6. What are the risks to developing the selected technology?
       4.1.7. How will you structure your program to meet requirements and mitigate risk?
       4.1.8. What is your business-based transition plan that meets customer approval?
   4.2. At the discretion of the TD director, a more rigorous systems engineering assessment,
   such as Air Force Systems Engineering Assessment Model (AF SEAM), may be used in
   place of the 8 SE Key Questions in paragraphs 4.1.1 through 4.1.8 to assess the application of
   the S&T SE process.
5. Accompanying AFRL SE Guidebook. The guidebook, which is both non-directive and
non-prescriptive, guides the user in the application and assessment of the AFRL S&T SE process
for    technology     development.          It    is   available   at     the  following  site:
https://org2.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/afrlhq/EN/Docs/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2fsite

B59%2dBDC2%2dC2BAE831C567%7d . The guidebook:
   5.1. Elaborates on the principles and fundamentals of the S&T SE process and provides
   examples of activities that typically occur at each step of the S&T SE Process.
   5.2. Aids in the evaluation and assessment of individual S&T program progress in applying
   the S&T SE process for Basic Research, Applied Research, and Advanced Technology
   Development.
