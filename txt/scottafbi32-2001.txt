38. Public Assembly Facilities. A public assembly facility is a theater, open mess/club, golf
course clubhouse, recreation center, bowling center, cafeteria, snack bar, library, childcare
center, arts and crafts center, gym/fitness center, or any AAFES retail sales facility.
   38.1. The closing of a public assembly facility must be accomplished by the facility manager
   or an assistant who has been trained on proper closing procedures. Closing requirements are
   as follows:
       38.1.1. All trash must be removed from the facility daily.

       every 6 months, more frequently if necessary, to prevent accumulation of grease in out-
       of-reach places. The cleaning must be coordinated and conducted under the supervision
       of the 375 CES/CEFP personnel. The facility manager must maintain a record of the
       cleanings to ensure the facility does not exceed the cleaning cycle that has been
       established for the facility.

   emphasis should be placed on:
       38.2.1. Maintaining aisles, corridors, exits, exit accesses, and exit discharges, so they are
       clear and unobstructed at all times.
       38.2.2. Occupant Load. The 375 CES/CEFP personnel will assist you in determining the
       exact number of occupants your facility will hold safely to prevent overcrowding and
       exceeding occupant capacity.

       38.2.4. Notify the 375 CES/CEFP personnel before altering the facility for any special
       events; prior approval by the 375 CES/CEFP is required to ensure a fire-safe event.
