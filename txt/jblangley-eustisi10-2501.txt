                                           MISSION

1.1. General Information. The JBLE Emergency Management (EM) program is defined as a
cross-functional program that integrates procedures and standards for planning, logistical
requirements, emergency response actions, emergency response guidelines and exercises, and
evaluations. It establishes responsibilities, procedures and standards for JBLE mitigation and
emergency response to physical threats resulting from major accidents, natural disasters,
conventional attacks (including those using high-yield explosives), and terrorist use of CBRNE
materials. Its prescribed planning process helps commanders maintain effective command and
control and ensure mission continuation during contingencies. The JBLE EM program addresses
these physical threats occurring either individually or in combination.
1.2. Missions. The primary mission of the JBLE EM program is to prevent, prepare, respond to,
recover from, and mitigate the effects of major accidents, natural disasters and terrorist use of
CBRNE that threaten JBLE missions and resources. The ancillary mission of the JBLE EM
program is to support homeland defense and civil support operations and to provide Defense
Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) and sister services located in the Hampton Roads area.
1.3. Supporting Teams. The 633d Air Base Wing Commander (633 ABW/CC) is the
Installation Commander. All JBLE policies and emergency response operating plans must have
signatory approval from the ABW Commander. The Joint Base Emergency Manager (633
CES/CEX Flight Chief) serves as the Joint Base Commander’s primary advisor for Emergency
Management Issues.
     1.3.1. The 633 ABW will provide host support to all assigned, attached and tenant units.
     These units include Coast Guard, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), Air National Guard
     (ANG), Army Reserve (AR), and Army National Guard (ARNG) within the JBLE Area of
     Responsibility. All host and tenant units will be incorporated into the host JBLE
     Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2 and provide program
     representation within their respective units.
     1.3.2. 633 Readiness & Emergency Management Flight (633 CES/CEX): The 633 CES/CEX
     is the 633 ABW/CC’s EM program Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) and is the Joint
     Base’s Office of Emergency Management.
     1.3.3. 733 Emergency Management Office (733 MSD/CEXM): The 733 MSD/CEXM is the
     633 ABW/CC EM program Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR).
     1.3.4. Tasked organizations are listed within the JBLE CEMP 10-2 and this instruction.
1.4. Major Program Elements. Major program elements of the JBLE EM program include
direct and indirect support of emergency response operations, command and control, combat
support requirements, emergency preparedness, and EM education and training.

                      EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE

2.1. Purpose. This supplement identifies Emergency Management (EM) Program structure for
Joint Base Langley Eustis and all tenant organizations located therein. It outlines and describes
specific functions, responsibilities and standards for implementing and managing a Joint EM
Program. Unless otherwise noted, the Joint Base EM program will follow the Department of
Defense and Air Force instructions.
2.2. Installation Functional Support. All JBLE host and tenant organizations will provide EM
program representation.
   2.2.1. AFI 10-2501 and JBLE CEMP 10-2 will serve to identify specific unit functional
   support tasks for emergency response operations.
   2.2.2. Organizations specifically tasked will support the programs to the fullest extent,
   including Staff Assistance Visits (SAV) and training requirements. Organizations without
   specific support tasking requirements may serve only as a conduit to pass EM information to
   their unit personnel. The Installation Office of Emergency Management will further define
   functional support structure and program representation.
   2.2.3. All JBLE organizations will become familiar with program planning and threat
   response actions as defined within AFI 10-2501, chapter 4 and the JBLE CEMP 10-2. Units
   will utilize planning and response processes under Air Force Incident Management System
   (AFIMS) phases of incident management: prevention, preparation, response, recovery, and
   mitigation.
   2.2.4. All JBLE organizations are expected to participate in EM related exercises and to take
   appropriate measures to prepare missions, personnel and resources for all phases of incident
   management and to safeguard them from the all hazards threat environment.
2.3. Planning and Management. The Emergency Management Program is comprised of a
strategic planning and management staff to maintain an EM program and a tactical response
structure to manage or conduct contingency response operations.
   2.3.1. Strategic Planning Structure: Is comprised of the Joint Base Emergency Management
   Working Group (JBEMWG); which is supported by the following sub-working groups.
       2.3.1.1. Sub-Working Groups: The JBEMWG is comprised of the following sub-
       working groups: 633 and 733 Emergency Management Working Groups (EMWGs),
       Emergency Services Working Group (ESWG), Public Health Emergency Working Group
       (PHEWG), Hazardous Material Planning Working Group (HMPWG), Recovery Working
       Group (RWG), and Readiness and Emergency Management aspects of the installation
       exercise evaluation program and unit EM Representatives.
       2.3.1.2. Supporting Working Groups: The JBEMWG is supported by the following JBLE
       working groups: Antiterrorism Working Group (ATWG), Force Protection Working
       Group (FPWG), Threat Working Group (TWG), and the Integrated Defense Plan
       Working Group (IDPWG).

                   PROGRAM PLANNING, THREATS AND RESPONSE

4.1. Purpose. JBLE, including tenant units, will remain vigilant toward threats to mission,
personnel and resources. Commanders must be aware of current threat posture and facilitate
awareness within their respective organizations. Every effort must be undertaken to identify and
correct vulnerabilities. Planning must include protective and response actions to provide unity of
effort, allocate resources efficiently and identify shortfalls early. Force survivability and mission
continuation are the highest priorities for planning.
4.2. Planning Goals. JBLE is considered a low threat area (LTA) for CBRNE events. For
specific threats and planning see the CEMP 10-2. The planning goals listed below are not in
priority order:
   4.2.1. Decentralize vital operations and mission-critical resources.
   4.2.2. Disperse, shelter or cover response and recovery resources.
   4.2.3. Relocate, evacuate, or shelter all personnel affected or potentially affected by the
   incident.
4.3. Incident Response. Disaster Response Force (DRF) personnel are task organized to
employ threat-specific countermeasures that mitigate risk to resources and personnel necessary
to sustain operations. Unit specific tasks are identified within the JBLE CEMP 10-2. As a
minimum, all units must maintain the following response capability:
   4.3.1. Communications: Maintain unit recall capability to direct duty reporting requirements
   for all personnel. Advise personnel of warning and notification procedures.
   4.3.2. Expedient Sheltering: Provide the ability to implement expedient contamination
   control and shelter-in-place procedures if an incident occurs with little or no warning. For
   planning considerations, see the Shelter in Place Operating Instruction maintained by the
   Office of Emergency Management. (AFI 10-2501, paragraph 3.10.15)
   4.3.3. Evacuation: Be prepared to evacuate hazard areas upon threat (i.e. credible bomb
   threat), direction of the Incident Commander (IC) or JBLE Commander. Evacuation may be
   ordered due to major accidents, natural disasters, active shooter, terrorist use of CBRNE,
   and/or hazardous material releases.
4.4. Emergency Response Maps. Installation maps are available to unit EM representatives for
distribution to UCCs, First Responders and Emergency Responders. Maps are available in print
at 1:6000 scale. Contact 633 CES Readiness and Emergency Management to request maps (764-
4417).

   response equipment at protected locations.
   5.2.3. Report EM Program equipment operational discrepancies, inventory shortfalls and
   malfunctions to the appropriate Emergency Management office at Langley AFB (LAFB) or
   Fort Eustis VA (FEVA) Programs and Operations section for operational planning purposes.
   Each organization must program sustainment requirements into the Logistics and Resources
   budget and request additional funding through their command when necessary.
   5.2.4. Review and validate equipment readiness during increased threat posture conditions.
5.3. Training Assets. All training assets will be kept separate from operational assets. Clearly
mark such assets as training use only and use only IAW Technical Orders (T.O.s). For further
guidance, see AFI 10-2501, paragraph 5.5.2.
5.4. Unit EM Program Assets. All materials required for individuals are the responsibility of
the unit.

               AIR FORCE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (AFIMS)

8.1. Introduction: JBLE has implemented the operational objectives and organizational
structure of the AFIMS. Full Operational Capability (FOC) was obtained in October 2010.
8.2. Requirement: The Installation Commander of JBLE is responsible for a myriad of
operational and emergency situations that require established procedures, trained personnel and
sufficient communications and equipment to adequately respond to the situations. Homeland
Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 5 was signed into legislation requiring all first responders
to use the National Incident Management System (NIMS). HQ Air Force Civil Engineer Support
Agency (AFCESA) developed the AFIMS to be in compliance with HSPD 5. Therefore, JBLE
will use the framework of the AFIMS for such responses. AFIMS will provide the commander
the flexibility to assemble his senior staff, special advisors and a formal Emergency Operation
Center element, to respond as needed or directed. The system will be tailored to address serious
operational interruptions, anti-terrorism/force protection situations, industrial plant responses,
natural disasters, and other crises requiring immediate response by the JBLE senior leadership.

                                     AFIMS STRUCTURE

9.1. Organizational Structure for JBLE: The 633 ABW/CC, as the designated installation
commander, is responsible for all mission operations and for all crisis action responses. To assist
the 633 ABW/CC with crisis responses, the JBLE will provide expertise and response support
through a series of elements called the Disaster Response Force (DRF) as required by AFI 10-
2501 and highlighted below:
   9.1.1. DRF Composition: DRF Members assigned functions are listed in AFI 10-2501,
   paragraph 2.4.2. These elements are summarized in Chapter 10 and specific guidance is
   contained in the JBLE CEMP 10-2.
