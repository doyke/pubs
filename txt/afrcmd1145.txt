1. Mission. The MDS provides a level of mission readiness sufficient to assure the health of the
military community for maximum readiness and combat capability. They provide medical
support (if applicable) for authorized wing personnel to the greatest extent possible to ensure the
wing is medically fit to meet its mission.
2. Command. The Medical Squadron Commander (CC):
     2.1. Reports to the Medical Group (MDG) CC or to the Wing CC where a MDG does not
     exist.
     2.2. Exercises administrative control over assigned personnel.
3. Responsibilities.
     3.1. Execute commander’s responsibilities as outlined in AFI 1-2, Commanders
     Responsibilities.
     3.2. Provides oversight and execution of the medical mission.
4. Mobilization. AFRC forces are under the administrative control (ADCON) of AFRC/CC.
When activated or mobilized (e.g. under 10 U.S.C. §§ 12301(a), 12302, 12304, 12304a, or
12304b), combatant command authority (COCOM) transfers to the combatant commander to
which the forces are assigned/attached and operational control (OPCON) transfers to the
operational chain of command established by that commander.
