                                  PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

1.1. Program Definition. Military information is a national security asset which must be
conserved and protected and which may be shared with foreign representatives only when there
is a clearly defined advantage to the United States. It is United States policy to avoid creating
false impressions of its readiness to make defense articles, technologies, services or information
available. Therefore, Air Force personnel must ensure compliance with this Air Force
Instruction (AFI) as part of the initial planning for international activities. Only designated
foreign disclosure officers (FDOs) may approve the disclosure of classified and controlled
unclassified information to foreign representatives. This instruction documents requirements of
the United States Air Force Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program; its
applicability to Air Force organizations and activities; responsibilities of Major Command
(MAJCOM), Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) and Field Operating Agency (FOA) Commanders;
responsibilities of Foreign Disclosure Officers at all command levels; and guidance for
authorizing the disclosure of Classified Military Information (CMI) and Controlled
Unclassified Information (CUI) to foreign representatives. (See explanation of terms CMI and
CUI.) This AFI also provides guidance for authorizing disclosures of information that is not CMI
or CUI and for approving foreign national visits to bases and facilities.
1.2. Applicability. Guidance in this instruction applies to:
     1.2.1. United States Air Force disclosures of CMI and CUI to foreign representatives in
     support of officially approved United States Air Force international programs. This AFI does
     not apply to disclosures regarding National Intelligence, Communications Security and
     Intelligence, Counterintelligence, Atomic Information, Strategic Planning and Guidance, and
     Narcotics Intelligence.
     1.2.2. United States Air Force decisions for disclosing information (including foreign
     government information) to which access or distribution limitations have been applied in
     accordance with national laws, policies, and regulations of the originating country.
     1.2.3. United States Air Force reviews of U.S. contractor requests to export defense articles,
     services, and technical data controlled by the Department of State, Directorate of Defense
     Trade Controls, or Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security.
     1.2.4. Foreign government or international organization sponsored visits and assignments of
     foreign personnel or their representatives to United States Air Force facilities that involve
     access to CMI or CUI.
     1.2.5. Notification and approval process for visits that are sponsored, controlled,
     administered, and recorded by U.S. European Command under its J5/8, Policy, Strategy,
     Partnering and Capabilities Directorate; by the U.S. Africa Command under its African
     Cooperation Fund; by the U.S. Southern and Northern Commands under their Latin
     American Cooperation Fund; by COCOM Traditional Commanders Activities Programs; by

                                           Chapter 2

        UNITED STATES AIR FORCE FOREIGN DISCLOSURE AUTHORITY

2.1. Introduction. United States Air Force FDOs authorize disclosures of CMI and CUI. This
chapter identifies how disclosure authority is delegated to the United States Air Force (USAF),
the parameters for the Air Force’s general disclosure authority, the criteria which must be
satisfied before disclosures can be authorized, how authority is delegated and re-delegated within
the Air Force, how Air Force disclosure guidance is documented, the process for formulating
disclosure guidance for new programs or initiatives, and who exercises USAF disclosure
authority. Chapter 4, Chapter 5, Chapter 6, Chapter 7, and Chapter 8 explain how to apply
disclosure guidance to various foreign disclosure and technology transfer processes.
2.2. Air Force Disclosure Authority for CMI. National Policy and Procedures for the
Disclosure of Classified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International
Organizations (Short title: National Disclosure Policy (NDP-1)) provides national policy and
procedures to U.S. Executive Branch departments and agencies for the disclosure of CMI to
foreign representatives. It also delegates general release authority for CMI to the head of the
department or agency originating CMI. The Secretary of the Air Force designates The Deputy
Under Secretary of the Air Force (International Affairs) (SAF/IA)) as the Air Force Principal
Disclosure Authority. SAF/IA designates the Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer
Division (SAF/IAPD) as the Air Force Designated Disclosure Authority.
2.3. Air Force Disclosure Authority for CUI. The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and
Export Administration Act (EAA), as amended, legislate the policies and procedures for the
export of defense articles, services, and technical data having a military or space application or
being of dual-use interest, respectively. The Secretary of the Air Force designates SAF/IAPD as
the Air Force OPR for exports of technology, defense articles, technical data, and services under
both the AECA and EAA. SAF/IAPD formulates and recommends to the Defense Technology
Security Administration (DTSA) Air Force positions regarding exports of defense articles,
services, and technical data.
2.4. Air Force Disclosure Authority Parameters.
   2.4.1. Consistent with paragraphs 2.2 and 2.3, SAF/IAPD develops and delegates
   disclosure guidelines for CMI and CUI originated by or for the Air Force for purposes such
   as, but not limited to, foreign military sales, exercises, military training, co-development or
   co-production programs, armaments cooperation initiatives, foreign national visits, foreign
   national information requests, and munitions license requests. NDP-1 delegates authority to
   disclose eight categories of CMI to authorized foreign governments and international
   organizations. A description of the categories is at Attachment 2.
   2.4.2. With the consent of the originator, SAF/IAPD develops and delegates disclosure
   guidelines for CMI or CUI officially obtained from a foreign source, combined military
   information, joint information, information originated by or for any U.S. department or
   agency, and proprietary information
   2.4.3. SAF/IAPD disclosure authority does not extend to the following information.
   However, SAF/ IAPD will assist proponents in obtaining disclosure approval from the
   appropriate authorities:
AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014                                                                        11


       2.4.3.1. Information marked Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals (NOFORN) in
       accordance with DCID 6/6, Security Controls on the Dissemination of Intelligence
       Information and DCID 6/7, Intelligence Disclosure Policy.
       2.4.3.2. DCID 6/6 and 6/7 authorize use of the NOFORN caveat on intelligence
       information in order to protect sources, methods, techniques, and operations. Therefore,
       disclosure restriction on release of NOFORN applies to Category 8 (Military
       Intelligence) information only.
       2.4.3.3. If the security classification guide reflects the material to be NOFORN, then the
       security classification guide must be changed to ensure compliance with DCID 6/6 and
       6/7.
       2.4.3.4. All material that is not intelligence information will be reviewed for proper
       markings, as defined by the information Security Oversight Office (ISSO) Directive
       Number 1, dated 25 Mar 2003. Improperly applied dissemination controls will be
       removed. Non-intelligence information marked with the NOFORN dissemination control
       will be reviewed by a subject matter expert to ensure intelligence information is not
       included. If the NOFORN caveat is determined to be improperly applied the servicing
       FDO may make a disclosure decision to remove the caveat.
       2.4.3.5. Originator Controlled (ORCON), or Caution-Proprietary Information Involved
       (PROPIN) in accordance with DCID 6/6, Security Controls on the Dissemination of
       Intelligence Information.
       2.4.3.6. Information marked with a Special Access Required caveat in accordance with
       AFI 16-701, Special Access Programs.
       2.4.3.7. Information marked Restricted Data/Formerly Restricted Data (RD/FRD).
2.5. Disclosure Criteria. In order to exercise general disclosure authority and responsibilities
under NDP-1, DoDD 5230.11, and DoDD 2040.2, International Transfers of Technology,
Goods, Services, and Munitions, SAF/IAPD ensures all disclosures of CMI and CUI satisfy the
following NDP-1 criteria:
   2.5.1. Disclosure is consistent with U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives
   concerning the foreign government or international organization.
   2.5.2. Disclosure is consistent with U.S. military and security objectives.
   2.5.3. The foreign recipient will afford U.S. information the same degree of security
   protection as that provided to it by the United States.
   2.5.4. Disclosure will result in a clearly defined benefit for the United States.
   2.5.5. Disclosure is limited to information necessary to the purpose for which disclosure is
   made.
2.6. Requests Exceeding Air Force General Disclosure Authority. Requests for disclosure
approval that exceed United States Air Force disclosure authority may be authorized if they
satisfy all disclosure criteria. SAF/IAPD must coordinate with either the National Disclosure
Policy Committee (NDPC) or the agency originating the information to obtain disclosure
authority. Requests approved by the NDPC are known as Exceptions to National Disclosure
Policy (ENDPs). An NDPC decision may be appealed to the Deputy Secretary of Defense. After
 12                                                                   AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014


receiving all required inputs from functional offices, SAF/IAPD will usually require ten working
days to prepare the ENDP request and another ten working days for coordination within the
Headquarters Air Force before submission to the NDPC. The NDPC usually concludes its review
in ten working days. Requests for exceptions contain the following elements:
   2.6.1. A concise statement of the action proposed and why an exception to policy is required.
   2.6.2. A detailed technical description of the equipment or information to be disclosed. The
   description is provided by the office requesting disclosure approval.
   2.6.3. An assessment of how each of the disclosure criteria and conditions will be met. The
   assessment of criteria and conditions is provided by the office requesting disclosure approval.
   2.6.4. Identification of any limitations placed on the proposed disclosure in terms of
   information to be disclosed, disclosure timing, or other pertinent caveats that may affect
   NDPC approval or denial of the request.
   2.6.5. A statement that the requested exception is either a continuing exception, subject to
   annual review, or a one-time exception.
   2.6.6. U.S. embassy country team, and theater command assessments of the proposed
   disclosure (provided by the office requesting disclosure approval).
   2.6.7. The opinion of other interested departments or agencies, if joint service or shared
   information is involved.
   2.6.8. Any other information that would assist the NDPC members in evaluating the
   proposal.
2.7. Coordination of Disclosures Involving Military Equipment. Exports of military
equipment constitute disclosures of information subject to the requirements of this instruction.
Therefore, disclosure initiatives that involve foreign military sales or direct commercial sales of
Air Force systems and commercially developed non-U.S. inventory systems are coordinated and
approved in accordance with the “Topline” process. SAF/IAPD is the Air Force OPR for
Topline Coordination.
   2.7.1. Each Topline proposal will contain the following elements:
       2.7.1.1. A thorough description of what is proposed for sale (provided by the office
       requesting disclosure approval).
       2.7.1.2. An explanation of the benefits for the United States (provided by the office
       requesting disclosure approval).
       2.7.1.3. An evaluation of the risk of compromise or unintended end use based on General
       Security of Military Information Agreements (GSOMIA), National Disclosure Policy
       Committee country security surveys, or intelligence community assessments.
       2.7.1.4. An assessment of foreign availability of similar weapons systems, technologies
       or capabilities (provided by the office requesting disclosure approval).
       2.7.1.5. A description of precedent cases, if any.
AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014                                                                       13


  2.7.2. Foreign sales initiatives will be coordinated through SAF/AQ, SAF/IA, SAF/US,
  SAF/CIO/A6, AF/A3, AF/A4/7, AF/A5, and approved by CSAF when any of the following
  conditions apply:
     2.7.2.1. Low Observable (LO), Counter Low Observable (CLO), and Non-Cooperative
     Target Recognition (NCTR) capabilities or technologies are involved.
     2.7.2.2. The proposed sale will result in foreign access to U.S. classified software source
     code.
     2.7.2.3. The system, technology, or capability is unique to the United States (i.e., No
     equivalent substitutes are available from foreign sources) and provides United States Air
     Force a significant military advantage over potential adversaries.
     2.7.2.4. The United States has no effective countermeasures or defenses against the
     system or capability.
     2.7.2.5. The proposed recipient government’s ability or willingness to protect U.S.
     military information or use it for the intended U.S. purpose is doubtful.
     2.7.2.6. The system proposed for sale is derived from a special access program.
  2.7.3. Proposed international sales that involve any of the following items will be
  coordinated at the Directorate level in SAF/AQ, SAF/US, SAF/CIO/A6, AF/A3, AF/A4/7,
  AF/A5, and approved by SAF/IA:
     2.7.3.1. Aircraft and air vehicles,
     2.7.3.2. Jet or rocket engines,
     2.7.3.3. Precision guided munitions and precision targeting systems,
     2.7.3.4. Unmanned aerial vehicles,
     2.7.3.5. Night and adverse weather terrain avoidance flight navigation systems,
     2.7.3.6. Radars,
     2.7.3.7. Intelligence collection systems,
     2.7.3.8. Command, control and communications systems,
     2.7.3.9. Information warfare and defensive countermeasure systems,
     2.7.3.10. Ballistic missile defense systems, or
     2.7.3.11. Unclassified software source code for any of the aforementioned items.
  2.7.4. In instances when consensus cannot be reached, dissenting opinions will be elevated
  to the appropriate assistant secretary or deputy chief of staff, or to CSAF (if necessary) for
  resolution.
  2.7.5. Staff officer recommendations to non-concur and to impose conditions and limitations
  on a proposed sale must be justified in writing. Their justification will be based on
  substantiated risk to US military security, national security, or foreign policy objectives.
  2.7.6. SAF/IAPD normally requires ten working days to prepare the Topline request. The
  coordination process should normally be completed within an additional ten working days.
 14                                                                 AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014


2.8. Delegation of Air Force Disclosure Authority. The United States Air Force Foreign
Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program relies on the principle of delegation to ensure
disclosure decisions are made promptly and effectively. After satisfying the disclosure criteria
identified in paragraph 2.5 or obtaining approval from the appropriate authority, SAF/IAPD
may delegate specific disclosure authority to be exercised by United States Air Force FDOs.
   2.8.1. SAF/IAPD may delegate disclosure authority to United States Air Force MAJCOM,
   DRU or FOA FDOs.
   2.8.2. MAJCOM, DRU, or FOA FDOs may re-delegate disclosure authority to their
   subordinate FDOs in order to support international programs, foreign requests for
   information, or foreign visits.
   2.8.3. FDOs will notify United States Air Force personnel responsible for implementation of
   international programs when disclosure guidance related to their program has been received.
   (T-0)
2.9. Documentation of Delegated Disclosure Authority. SAF/IAPD is the approval authority
for delegated disclosure authority to MAJCOM, DRU, and FOA FDOs in support of both one-
time and continuing disclosure requirements. One-time disclosure authorizations may be
documented in a specific memorandum or visit authorization. Requirements for continuing
information disclosures are normally documented in Delegation of Disclosure Authority Letters
(DDLs). Should the disclosure of information be required to support an international program
prior to issuance of a DDL, SAF/IAPD may approve disclosure guidance to support the program
until a DDL is approved.
   2.9.1. To establish disclosure guidance for new international programs:
       2.9.1.1. Proponents for international programs will identify program objectives, program
       information proposed for disclosure, and the classification and originator of the
       information proposed for disclosure to their supporting FDO. (T-0) Proponents must also
       be prepared to assist the FDO in documenting how the program satisfies the disclosure
       criteria in paragraph 2.5. (T-0)
       2.9.1.2. FDOs supporting international programs must participate in initial and
       continuing international program planning activities, as necessary, to ensure that
       disclosure guidance can be developed, coordinated at the local levels, and forwarded to
       SAF/IAPD in advance of program activities commencing. (T-0)
       2.9.1.3. Servicing FDOs must forward requests for initial or updated program disclosure
       guidance, including the evaluation of the appropriate disclosure criteria, through
       disclosure channels to SAF/IAPD through their MAJCOM, DRU or FOA. (T-0) FDOs
       should coordinate requests for disclosure guidance with all command offices having a
       functional interest in the program, and information to be disclosed, prior to forwarding
       their requests to SAF/IAPD.
           2.9.1.3.1. Specifically for armaments cooperation programs, MAJCOM FDOs will
           forward MAJCOM-approved DDLs to SAF/IAPQ or SAF/IAPS as part of the
           coordination package.
           2.9.1.3.2. Proposed DDLs for international initiatives, other than armaments
           cooperation programs, originating within subordinate elements, are prepared by the
AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014                                                                      15


          servicing FDO and forwarded to SAF/IAPD through the MAJCOM, DRU or FOA
          FDO. (T-0)
       2.9.1.4. FDOs will ensure proposed DDLs are consistent with the format at Attachment
       3. (T-1)
       2.9.1.5. SAF/IAPD prepares and approves DDLs for disclosure initiatives originating at
       Headquarters Air Force.
2.10. Dissemination of DDLs. SAF/IAPD limits dissemination of DDLs to foreign disclosure
offices. Broader dissemination increases the risk of misinterpretation and disclosure approvals
made by unauthorized individuals. However, certain circumstances may warrant dissemination
outside disclosure offices. The following guidelines apply to these situations.
   2.10.1. FDOs will submit their requests to transfer their DDLs to SAF/IAPD Workflow. (T-
   1) Once they received approval from SAF/IAPD, FDOs may provide information copies of
   DDLs to Air Force offices to guide international program development, support assignment
   of foreign representatives in United States Air Force organizations, or to facilitate
   sanitization of information in preparation for disclosure review. An FDO’s decision to
   provide DDL copies outside of FDO channels is based on a program proponent’s need for
   frequent access to the DDL and when physical separation from the FDO makes it impractical
   to review the DDL at the disclosure office.
   2.10.2. The FDO will transmit the DDL under a cover memo that documents specifically
   why the DDL is being provided. (T-1) Clearly state the DDL may not be copied in whole or
   in part, may not be incorporated into other documents, and the transmittal memo must remain
   attached to the DDL. (T-1) A sample transmittal memo is at Attachment 4.
   2.10.3. The following statement must be conspicuously placed on the transmittal memo to
   the DDL disseminated outside of foreign disclosure channels: (T-1).
2.10.3.1. “This DDL is for information only. It does not constitute authority to release
equipment, technology or information and may not be used for such purpose. This DDL may not
be copied in whole or in part. Information contained in the DDL may not be incorporated into
other documents.”

   2.10.4. SAF/IAPD must approve, in writing, all delegations of United States Air Force
   disclosure authority outside United States Air Force. Proponents for such delegation must
   justify their requests in writing to SAF/IAPD through disclosure channels. (T-1)

                                            Chapter 3

                                 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

3.1. Introduction. The National Disclosure Policy requires all departments and agencies which
are responsible for implementation of National Disclosure Policy to issue directives and
instructions to assure that disclosure decisions are made promptly and disclosure activities under
their jurisdiction are carried out effectively. To this end, the following program management
requirements have been developed.
3.2. Program Oversight. SAF/IAPD will evaluate implementation and management of
MAJCOM, DRU, and FOA Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Programs. Staff
assistance visits will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines at Attachment 5.
SAF/IAPD will determine the staff assistance schedule.
3.3. MAJCOM, FOA and DRU Supplements to this Instruction. Coordinate all MAJCOM,
FOA, and DRU supplements with SAF/IAPD. (T-1)
3.4. United States Air Force Standard Suspenses for Disclosure Activities. In order to
respond promptly to disclosure requests made by supported activities, FDOs will track their
response time for document and visit requests. (T-1)
   3.4.1. The United States Air Force standard for responding to document requests is ten
   working days from the date of receipt. Within the ten-day period, FDOs will approve, deny,
   return without action (if the requestor provides insufficient information on which to make a
   disclosure decision), coordinate an extension (if necessary), or refer the request to the
   appropriate disclosure authority. (T-1)
   3.4.2. The United States Air Force standard for responding to visit requests is no later than
   five working days prior to the visit start date for one-time visits, if the request is submitted at
   least 15 working days prior to the visit start date. (T-1) Responses to visit requests received
   less than 15 days before the start date will be made as far in advance of the visit start date as
   possible. (T-1) Responses for recurring and extended visits should be made within 30
   calendar days of receipt of a visit request or prior to any visit or assignment of a foreign
   representative. (T-1)
3.5. Staffing and Recording of Disclosure Decisions. Air Force FDOs will use SPAN for
staffing and recording cases, decisions and reference data in support of departmental
responsibilities assigned by the National Disclosure Policy, the Arms Export Control Act and the
Export Administration Act. (T-1)
   3.5.1. FDOs will document SIPRNet communications requirements to establish SPAN
   access locally. (T-1)
   3.5.2. All classified disclosure decisions will be documented in the Foreign Disclosure
   System. (T-1) Foreign Disclosure offices without SPAN connectivity will work with their
   MAJCOM FDO office to ensure that classified disclosure decisions are documented in
   SPAN. (T-1)
AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014                                                                        17


3.6. Training Requirements. Prior to authorizing disclosures of CMI and CUI, FDOs must
complete the United States Air Force Foreign Disclosure Officer Training Course sponsored by
SAF/IAPD. (T-1)
   3.6.1. MAJCOM FDOs will be recertified on an annual basis by SAF/IAPD. The MAJCOM
   FDOs will then provide requisite training and certification for FDOs of subordinate
   organizations within their chain of command.
3.7. Outsourcing of National Disclosure Policy Functions. Within the Air Force, FDOs may
obtain contractor support for National Disclosure Policy functions subject to the following
criteria.
   3.7.1. Contractors will not exercise foreign disclosure decision authority for disclosures of
   CMI and CUI nor any other duties considered to be inherently governmental, in accordance
   with Part 7.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). (T-0)
   3.7.2. Contractors may research and conduct analyses of technical, operational, policy, and
   political and military factors related to proposed international programs.
   3.7.3. Contractors may draft supporting justification and disclosure guidance for
   international programs.
   3.7.4. Contractors may perform administrative functions such as coordination of disclosure
   initiatives and record keeping related to disclosure activities.
3.8. Waivers to Air Force Policy. SAF/IAPD will consider and may approve United States Air
Force requests to waive disclosure policies and procedures when the policy will negatively
impact a United States Air Force international program, and the waiver does not conflict with
U.S. law or interagency policies and procedures (including NDP-1 and relevant DoD
instructions, directives, and procedures). Personnel in the grade of Colonel or higher (military)
or GS-15 or higher (civilian) must sign all requests for waiver to this instruction. (T-1) Each
waiver should be submitted through local FDO channels en route to SAF/IAPD. The written
request will identify the following: (T-0)
   3.8.1. The specific policy to be waived;
   3.8.2. The specific impact if the policy is not waived;
   3.8.3. The reasons why the policy cannot be met; and
   3.8.4. The procedures are to be implemented until such time as the waiver expires. Such
   procedures will ensure the intent of Air Force disclosure and technology transfer policy is
   met.

                                            Chapter 4

                                DISCLOSING INFORMATION

4.1. Introduction. FDOs authorize disclosures of CMI or CUI to foreign representatives. FDO
approval is not required to provide United States Air Force information that has been officially
approved for public release or information that is unclassified and not controlled under the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) to a foreign government or international
organization. Disclosures are made for various reasons, i.e., in response to written requests for
information related to foreign military sales, armaments cooperation agreements and Air Force
activities in general, during visits by foreign representatives, and during exercises or operational
activities. There are three methods by which information can be disclosed: oral, visual and
documentary. Documentary disclosures occur when control of information in tangible form (i.e.,
equipment, written material, floppy disk, audio or video tape, etc.) is transferred to a foreign
government or international organization. This chapter serves several purposes. First, it
identifies the process through which United States Air Force personnel request disclosure
approvals. Second, it identifies FDO requirements for processing and approving disclosure
requests. Additionally, this chapter identifies administrative actions that must be completed after
a disclosure decision is made, and it establishes a process for disclosing unclassified information
that is not controlled.
4.2. Submitting Requests To Disclose Information.
   4.2.1. SAF/IA country directors will submit foreign embassy requests for CMI or CUI to the
   MAJCOM, DRU, or FOA FDO having disclosure authority over the information requested.
   SAF/IAPD will assist country directors as necessary.
       4.2.1.1. Unless other government-to-government channels are established (see
       paragraph 4.2.2.1), foreign governments or international organizations should submit
       requests for information through either their accredited attaché in Washington DC or the
       U.S. Security Cooperation Office (SCO) in country. Foreign governments and
       international organizations should submit electronic requests via the Foreign Disclosure
       System or via written request if they are not a SPAN user. Requests must contain the
       information specified in the SPAN Foreign Disclosure System.
   4.2.2. United States Air Force personnel will submit requests to disclose CMI or CUI to
   foreign recipients in the United States or abroad to their servicing FDO. (T-1)
       4.2.2.1. When designated by their government to conduct business with the United States
       Air Force, foreign representatives should use established procedures to submit requests
       related to specific foreign military sales programs or armaments cooperation agreements.
       Generally, such requests are submitted through the in-country SCO to United States Air
       Force individuals appointed as case managers or technical project officers, respectively.
       The case manager or technical project officer will submit requests to the servicing FDO.
       (T-1)
       4.2.2.2. The actual transfer of US technical data to foreign representatives, in most cases,
       must be pursuant to a foreign military sale, loan, lease or grant agreement, export license,
       or cooperative agreement (MOU, MOA).
AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014                                                                         19


   4.2.3. United States Air Force proponents must provide a written request to their servicing
   FDO. (If the disclosure action is based on a written request from a foreign government or
   international organization, an additional request from the United States Air Force proponent
   may not be necessary if the request contains the information required below) The United
   States Air Force proponent will include the following information in the request to the FDO:
   (T-1)
       4.2.3.1. The proposed foreign recipient including country, classification of information
       to be disclosed, and originator of the information.
       4.2.3.2. The purpose of the disclosure (i.e., foreign military sales program, armaments
       cooperation agreement, operational or exercise requirement, etc.).
       4.2.3.3. The benefit the United States is expected to receive from the disclosure or the
       resulting impact expected if the request is denied.
       4.2.3.4. For documentary disclosures, proponents must provide a copy of the document
       to be disclosed and identify any portions of the document that are not part of the
       disclosure request.
       4.2.3.5. For oral and visual disclosures, proponents must provide written details
       identifying information to be discussed.
       4.2.3.6. Requested release date.
   4.2.4. Air Force organizations will obtain assistance from their servicing FDO when
   receiving requests directly from foreign governments, international organizations, etc. (T-1)
4.3. Processing Requests To Disclose Information. FDOs will coordinate disclosure
proposals with offices having a functional interest in the information to be disclosed (including
interests within a geographic COCOM AOR). (T-0) This coordination ensures programmatic,
policy, operational, technology, and security related issues are evaluated. Subject matter experts
will be enlisted to provide assessments within their functional area. (T-0)
4.4. Approving Requests To Disclose Information.
   4.4.1. FDOs approve disclosure requests consistent with their delegated disclosure authority.
   FDOs will ensure disclosure approvals are consistent with the formats at Attachment 6 and
   Attachment 7. (T-1)
       4.4.1.1. When continuing authority is appropriate, FDOs will assist Air Force proponents
       in requesting a new, or revising a current, DDL. (T-1)
       4.4.1.2. FDOs will forward requests through disclosure channels to SAF/IAPD when
       their delegated authority is exceeded. (T-1) MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU FDOs will
       forward requests to SAF/ IAPD when their authority is exceeded. (T-1)
       4.4.1.3. Requests must include the information required by paragraphs 4.2.3. (T-1)
   4.4.2. FDOs include the following requirements in approvals to disclose information:
       4.4.2.1. Removal of bibliographies, reference lists, and distribution lists when these
       references are not, or would not be, approved for release to the recipient country.
 20                                                                    AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014


       4.4.2.2. The following statement must be stamped or typed on the front or cover page of
       documents containing CMI or CUI: (T-0)
4.4.2.2.1. “This information is furnished on the condition that it will not be released to another
nation without specific authority of the Department of the Air Force of the United States, that it
will be used for military purposes only, that individual or corporate rights originating in the
information, whether patented or not, will be respected, that the recipient will report promptly to
the United States any known or suspected compromise, and that the information will be provided
substantially the same degree of security afforded it by the Department of Defense of the United
States. Also, regardless of any other markings on the document, it will not be downgraded or
declassified without written approval of the originating U.S. agency.”

       4.4.2.3. Include the following statement at the beginning of electronic media containing
       CMI or CUI: (T-0)
4.4.2.3.1. “This information is furnished on the condition that it will be given substantially the
same degree of security protection given to it by the United States and will not be released to
another nation without United States Air Force authorization.”

   4.4.3. FDOs must ensure the proper information is included in all foreign disclosures: (T-1)
       4.4.3.1. “The U.S. Government sponsor is responsible to ensure that U.S. participants
       (government or contractor) involved in technical discussions of U.S. export-controlled or
       classified information during briefings, meetings, conferences, or events are provided
       advanced notification of the approved scope and limitations of this disclosure decision.”
       4.4.3.2. “To reduce the risk associated with latent metadata capture in digital products,
       documentary release is limited to paper copy only. When mission requirements dictate
       and are acknowledged by the responsible USG authority, release of digital products is
       permitted in read-only .pdf or .tif format.”
       4.4.3.3. “Prepare the briefing by adding the following as a header and footer to the title

AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014                                                                      21


      4.5.1.2. Air Force proponents must verify to the servicing FDO the date that disclosures
      of CMI and CUI were made. (T-0)
   4.5.2. CMI must be transferred on a government-to-government basis. (T-0) Such transfers
   may be made through government-to-government channels or other channels mutually
   agreed upon by the appropriate policy authorities of the sending and receiving governments.
   FDOs or Air Force proponents will use Air Force Form 349, Receipt for Documents Released
   to Accredited Representatives of Foreign Nations, when transmitting CMI to a foreign
   government or international organization. (T-1) Air Force organizations releasing classified
   information must maintain forms as prescribed in Air Force Records Disposition Schedule,
   Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). (T-1)
4.6. Documenting Disclosure Decisions. FDOs will document disclosures and denials of
classified information in the Foreign Disclosure System, unless this requirement has been
exempted. (T-1)
4.7. Disclosures Not Requiring FDO Authorization. Subject to all of the following
conditions, Air Force personnel do not require FDO authorization to disclose unclassified
information to which no access or distribution limitations have been applied:
   4.7.1. The intended recipient is a representative of a foreign government or international
   organization and the information is being provided for an official United States Air Force
   purpose. (Note: Air Force personnel must ensure any information to be provided to the
   general public, including foreign nationals, must be released in accordance with the
   provisions of AFI 35-102, Security and Policy Review Process. (T-1) A FOIA release
   determination, in accordance with DoD Regulation 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302, DoD
   Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program, must be made if a written request has been
   received for Air Force Records.) (T-0)
   4.7.2. The information is unclassified and related to the roles, missions, doctrine,
   organization and general capabilities of the United States Air Force, MAJCOMs, or any
   subordinate units; general information on the function, purpose and general capabilities and
   characteristics of defense equipment or general scientific, mathematical or engineering
   principles commonly taught in schools, colleges, or universities; and
   4.7.3. The information is not CUI; and
   4.7.4. No access or distribution limitations have been applied to the information in
   accordance with applicable U.S. or foreign laws or regulations, e.g., Freedom of Information
   Act; and
   4.7.5. The disclosure is for information purposes only. There is no U.S. government intent
   to sell, loan, lease, co-develop, or co-produce defense articles (ITAR-related), or
   4.7.6. Participate in any operational or exercise activities, support any current foreign
   military sales or armaments cooperation program, or assign foreign nationals to Air Force
   organizations (SC-related); and
   4.7.7. Originator consent for the disclosure is obtained; and
   4.7.8. The following statement is conspicuously displayed at the front or beginning of the
   disclosed information:
 22                                                                   AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014


4.7.8.1. “This briefing, presentation, or document is for information only. No U.S. Government
commitment to sell, loan, lease, co-develop or co-produce defense articles or provide defense
services is implied or intended.”

4.8. Foreign Attendance at Symposia, Conferences and Contract-Related Meetings.
   4.8.1. The appointment of a DoD security sponsor for classified meetings involving
   contractor participants does not exempt contractors from the licensing requirements of the
   International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
4.9. Foreign Access to Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), Non-secure
Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) or Stand-Alone Systems. AFI 33-200,
Information Assurance (IA) Management, and AFMAN 33-282, Computer Security, describe
requirements for foreign national access to Air Force information systems. Access to Air Force
information systems is controlled by the information owner with access guidance by Foreign
Nationals, provided in the System Security Plan, IAW AFI 33-210, Air Force Certification and
Accreditation (C&A) Program (AFCAP). Authority to connect to the SIPRNet, NIPRNet or
other networks by foreign nationals does not equate to authority to disclose data or access
systems located on that network. A disclosure review by the servicing FDO is a prerequisite for
access to information resident on SIPRNet, NIPRNet, or other networks.
4.10. Technical Orders.
   4.10.1. United States Air Force technical orders are government furnished equipment and in
   accordance with the Arms Export Control Act may not be exported except when they support
   sales of U.S. government furnished equipment. United States Air Force technical orders may
   be released to a foreign contractor after proper FDO review in direct support of an Air Force
   contract. United States Air Force technical orders may also be released in support of FMS
   activity through the Security Assistance Technical Order Distribution System
   (SATODS) only when the following conditions are met:
       4.10.1.1. The FMS customer’s system configuration is the same as the system
       documented in the technical order or so similar to the US system that the unrelated data
       does not complicate or confuse the operating or maintenance instruction; and
       4.10.1.2. All reference information in the technical order is releasable.
   4.10.2. For safety reasons, FDOs will not sanitize United States Air Force technical orders.
   (T-1)
   4.10.3. If these conditions cannot be met, a Country Standard Technical Order should be
   developed to match the FMS customer’s configuration.
AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014                                                                           23


                                            Chapter 5

 ONE-TIME AND RECURRING VISITS BETWEEN AIR FORCE PERSONNEL AND
  REPRESENTATIVES OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL
                        ORGANIZATIONS

5.1. Introduction. The AECA requires the U.S. Government to obtain security, non-transfer,
and end-use assurances from foreign governments and international organizations before
transferring defense articles, services, or technical data (classified or unclassified). Information
disclosed under the auspices of a foreign visit may constitute a defense article, service, or
technical data. Accordingly, the International Visits Program (IVP) was established to ensure
CMI and CUI information proposed for release to visitors has been properly authorized for
disclosure to the requesting government or international organization. This chapter includes
DoD International Visit Program (IVP) requirements and United States Air Force requirements
for processing visits to which the IVP does not apply. Visits to Air Force facilities should not
interfere with the facility’s mission requirements. Foreign governments and international
organizations are required to provide validated security clearances, need-to-know verification,
and government sponsorship regarding their citizens or representatives. FDOs are responsible
for approving or denying the disclosure of CMI and CUI to foreign representatives during visits
to Air Force or contractor facilities, or when Air Force personnel visit foreign government or
international organization facilities abroad or in the United States. In specific cases, FDOs may
also approve disclosures by U.S. contractors supporting Air Force programs (See para 7.5 for
guidance on sponsored visits). All visits subject to the requirements of this chapter can be
defined as either one-time or recurring. Extended visits are addressed in Chapter 6,
Assignments and Placements of Foreign Nationals.
5.2. General Visit Policies and Procedures.
   5.2.1. Air Force personnel disclose CMI and CUI only to foreign representatives who
   possess an appropriate security clearance and need-to-know as verified in their visit request
   and in accordance with disclosure guidance provided by the FDO.
   5.2.2. A visit authorization does not constitute the legal basis for providing defense articles,
   services (including training), or technical data to foreign representatives. Letters of Offer
   and Acceptance (LOAs), international agreements with a foreign government or international
   organization, or other appropriate legal arrangements must be concluded prior to FDOs
   authorizing disclosures of CMI and CUI related to the transfer of defense articles, services, or
   technical data. (T-0)
   5.2.3. Foreign governments are required to submit visit requests for US citizens acting on
   their behalf when visiting Air Force facilities.
   5.2.4. The U.S. contact officer for any foreign representative and foreign national visit must
   ensure physical controls are implemented to limit visitor access to that information
   authorized for disclosure. (T-1) SAF/IAPD does not usually require written security plans
   for one-time or recurring visits. However, SAF/IAPD or other functional program managers,
   in response to specific circumstances may require U.S. contact officers to prepare security
   plans on a case-by-case basis for one-time or recurring visits.
 24                                                                   AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014


   5.2.5. Air Force organizations ensure a badge or pass is issued that clearly identifies the
   bearer as a foreign representative.
   5.2.6. Air Force military or civilian personnel assigned to the organization will escort
   foreign representatives in facilities where access to CMI or CUI will or may occur. (T-1)
   One time and recurring visits require escorts to access Air Force facilities. Escorts for
   foreign representatives to and within other facilities are subject to local base security
   procedures. U.S. contractors, foreign representatives or U.S. foreign representative or U.S.
   citizen representing foreign nation cannot serve as escort.
   5.2.7. Air Force contact officers organizing U.S. guest lecturers for professional military
   education activities will inform such guests that foreign nationals are in attendance (T-1) and
   that the guests must obtain disclosure approval from their servicing FDO prior to any
   presentation where CMI or CUI may be discussed. (T-1)
   5.2.8. Air Force contact officers organizing foreign guest lecturers for professional military
   education activities will brief students regarding disclosure guidelines prior to the arrival of
   foreign guest lecturers. (T-1)
5.3. Submitting Visit Requests for Foreign Representatives. Air Force and foreign
proponents of foreign representative visits will submit requests to the servicing Air Force foreign
disclosure office as required below. (T-0)
   5.3.1. Visits to Air Force Organizations and Installations.
       5.3.1.1. Foreign governments will submit requests under the IVP for visits proposed by
       their representatives and when invited by an Air Force organization, ideally 30 days prior
       to the visit start date. SPAN will automatically assign visit responsibility to either
       SAF/IAPD or to a subordinate FDO based on SAF/IAPD guidance.
       5.3.1.2. Public Affairs Officers approve foreign national participation in public affairs
       activities subject to their visit approval process. No visit request under the IVP is
       required.
       5.3.1.3. DoD proponents responsible for managing peacetime engagement programs,
       such as the EUCOM military contact program, the Latin American Cooperation Fund,
       and the African Cooperation Fund, will submit visit requests to SAF/IAPD. (T-0)
       Requests will include proposed dates of visit, facility to be visited, points of contact,
       purpose of visit, and the visitor’s name, rank, position, organization of assignment, date
       of birth, citizenship, place of birth, security assurances and identification or passport
       number. (T-0)
       5.3.1.4. Air Force proponents for basic research visits by foreign nationals will submit
       proposals to the servicing FDO of the activity to be visited and provide information
       copies to additional organizations as appropriate. (T-0) The Air Force Office of
       Scientific Research (AFOSR) international offices are appropriate organizations to which
       basic research proponents should provide information copies of basic research visit

     research visits to the United States Air Force.
     5.3.1.5. Air Force personnel will coordinate with their servicing FDO before extending
     visit invitations to foreign representatives. (T-0) Invitations may be extended only after
     FDOs approve disclosure guidelines for the visit. Foreign representatives are required to
     submit security assurances via the IVP even though invited by Air Force activities.
        5.3.1.5.1. Proponents will provide the supporting FDO with the names of the
        proposed visitors, organization/agency, nationality, visit location, and specific
        purpose for the visit. Justification for the visit will include the advantage to the
        United States. If there is no established program, the visit dates and the information
        to be disclosed during the visit will be outlined. (T-0)
     5.3.1.6. U.S. defense contractors employing foreign nationals may directly arrange visits
     to Air Force organizations consistent with the requirements of the National Industrial
     Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM). Air Force organizations to be visited
     will request a copy of the export license or other written authorization, as applicable, to
     assist in planning for the visit. (T-0) Foreign national access to CMI in these cases is not
     authorized unless the U.S. Government has granted the individual a Limited Access
     Authorization. Air Force hosts must coordinate the visit with their servicing FDO. (T-0)
     5.3.1.7. The NATO security office submits visit requests for representatives of any

   of contact in advance of the visit. (T-0) The FDO will provide information copies of the
   approval, as necessary. (T-0)
   5.5.2. FDOs will provide the requester any information necessary for the visitor to complete
   arrangements for the visit, for example, name of U.S. point of contact, contact’s phone
   number, uniform requirements, etc. (T-1)
   5.5.3. FDOs will not sponsor foreign visits to U.S. contractor facilities unless approval under
   paragraph 7.5 of this instruction has been obtained. (T-0) Air Force sponsorship of foreign
   visits to U.S. contractor facilities may constitute an exemption to the licensing requirements
   of the ITAR and Export Administration Act.
5.6. Denying Visit Requests for Foreign Representatives. FDOs will notify the requester
when a visit has been denied. (T-0) FDOs will provide the requester with justification for the
denial. (T-0) Organizations may deny visits for reasons such as operational, mission or

                                            Chapter 6

           ASSIGNMENTS AND PLACEMENTS OF FOREIGN NATIONALS

6.1. Introduction. Foreign representatives may be assigned to or placed in Air Force
organizations only in accordance with the terms of a written agreement or foreign military sales
(FMS) LOA concluded in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. These terms identify
administrative support, liability, obligations, and responsibilities of all parties. The LOA or
agreement also establishes the extended visit position. Sample terms that apply to placement and
assignment of foreign representatives are at Attachment 8. The exact language may differ as a
result of the negotiation of an agreement or LOA, but all requirements of these terms will be
addressed. An extended visit request identifies the individual who will be assigned to the
position. Extended visit requests are required for personnel participating in the Military
Personnel Exchange Program (MPEP). This chapter outlines six extended visit categories, five
of which are currently defined by DoD policy. The sixth category refers to foreign nationals
under contract to the Air Force. Do not make any commitments to assign visitors to Air Force
organizations under extended visits unless the requirements of this chapter have been met.
Proponents for extended visits other than one of the six types defined in this chapter will forward
proposals with sufficient justification, a description of duties to be assigned and proposed
disclosure guidelines through command channels to SAF/IAPD for a policy evaluation. (T-0)
6.2. Types of Extended Visit Programs. Visitors are assigned subject to the requirements of
the Military Personnel Exchange Program (MPEP), the Engineer and Scientist Exchange
Program (ESEP), the Administrative and Professional Personnel Exchange Program (APEP), the
Cooperative Program Personnel (CPP) program, the Country Liaison Officer (CLO) program, or
the Foreign Liaison Officer (FLO) program. Although not a specific program, foreign nationals
employed by or under contract to the U.S. Government and performing duty on an Air Force
installation are also considered to be on extended visits.
6.3. Bases for Extended Visit Positions. MPEP, APEP and ESEP exchanges require an
international agreement that provides for the exchange of personnel between governments. The
authority for CPP is a cooperative RDT&E or production agreement that establishes a specific
cooperative program between parties and includes provisions for placing CPP. The CLO is
established through an FMS case that provides for the placement of CLO personnel to assist with
administrative details for international military students from the CLO’s country. CLOs are
assigned through the Air Force Security Assistance Training Squadron (AFSAT). The
establishment of a FLO is by an FMS case that provides for the placement of FLO personnel and
defines the specific support or services to be provided to the FLO by the DoD. A FLO may also
be established by international agreement. However, an LOA is also required for reimbursement
to the DoD when support or services are provided. FLOs are assigned through the Air Force
Security Assistance and Cooperation Directorate (AFSAC) and have a more limited role in FMS
cases.
   6.3.1. International Airman Division (SAF/IAPA), Directorate of Policy, Deputy Under
   Secretary for International Affairs provides policy guidance regarding the establishment and
   management of MPEP positions. See AFI 16-107, Military Personnel Exchange Program
   (MPEP). Designated MAJCOM offices of primary responsibility provide MAJCOM level
   oversight and support for foreign exchange personnel, see para 10.6, AFI 16-107.
AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014                                                                          29


   6.3.2. Armaments Cooperation Division, Directorate of Policy, Deputy Under Secretary for
   International Affairs (SAF/IAPQ) provides policy guidance regarding establishment and
   management of APEP, ESEP positions, see AFI 16-110, U.S. Air Force Participation in
   International Armaments Cooperation (IAC) Programs. CPP policy guidance is covered
   under AFMAN 16-114, Procedures for U.S. Air Force Participation in International
   Armaments Cooperation (IAC) Programs. International focal points may be designated at
   MAJCOM or subordinate activities to provide advice and assistance regarding
   implementation of international armaments cooperation policies.
   6.3.3. Security Assistance Policy Division, Directorate of Policy, Deputy Under Secretary
   for International Affairs (SAF/IAPX) provides policy guidance regarding establishment and
   management of LOAs for FLO support, see AFMAN 16-101, International Affairs and
   Security Assistance Management. The Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation
   Directorate and the Air Force Security Assistance Training Squadron (AFSAT) provide
   advice and assistance regarding implementation of security assistance policies.
   6.3.4. Local contracting activities will coordinate contracts to hire foreign nationals with the
   FDO prior to advertising the contract. (T-0)
6.4. Establishing Extended Visit Positions.
   6.4.1. Air Force proponents seeking to establish an extended visitor position will coordinate
   with the appropriate OPR within their command to verify that an appropriate agreement
   exists to establish the basis for the assignment. Where no agreement exists, the extended
   visit position may not be established until such time as the appropriate agreement/LOA is in
   place. Proponents will advise the servicing FDO of initiatives to create extended visit
   positions and include the FDO in planning for such assignments. (T-0)
       6.4.1.1. For activities outside Headquarters Air Force, FDOs advise SAF/IAPD of
       approved extended visit positions. At a minimum, FDOs identify the type of position
       (i.e., MPEP, ESEP, APEP, CPP, FLO, CLO or contractor), the basis under which the
       position would be approved, and the location of the extended visit position.
   6.4.2. An important aspect of planning for an extended visitor is the identification of the
   visitor’s assigned responsibilities and duties. All programs under which an extended visit is
   made require the development of a position description. These position descriptions are
   necessary to ensure assigned duties are consistent with the authorizing agreement under
   which visitors are assigned and there is no misunderstanding between parties regarding the
   responsibilities that will be assigned to the visitor. A sample position description for MPEP
   is found in AFI 16-107, Military Personnel Exchange Program (MPEP). A sample position
   description for other extended visit positions is found at Attachment 9.
       6.4.2.1. Generally, position descriptions will be included in the staff packages requesting
       extended visit positions under the ESEP, CPP, and MPEP programs. (T-0)
       6.4.2.2. ESEP, CPP, and MPEP participants will not perform liaison functions between
       the United States Air Force and the parent service. (T-0) FLOs will not act in an official
       capacity for the Air Force. (T-0)
 30                                                                   AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014


6.5. Dual Assignments as CPPs and FLOs. In some cases, and in accordance with the terms
of the authorizing agreement, an extended visitor may perform duties part time as a FLO and part
time as a CPP. SAF/IA must approve the arrangements for management of such visitors.
Requests for such approvals must be forwarded to SAF/IAPD through disclosure channels. (T-0)
   6.5.1. Proposed arrangements must ensure that such “dual assignments” would not be
   detrimental to the cooperative program involved and that responsibility and funding for the
   FLO functions are separately maintained. (T-0) This requirement exists since FLO and CPP
   positions rely on different U.S. legal authorities.
   6.5.2. Dual assignments are not permitted for ESEP, MPEP, and APEP positions.
6.6. Coordinating Extended Visit Requests. FDOs will be notified of proposed assignments
to extended visit positions either via SPAN, recommend 30 days prior to visit start date, or by the
Air Force supervisor of a foreign exchange officer. FDOs will establish processes so that all
functional offices with an interest in the proposed assignment have an opportunity to review and
make recommendations regarding the request. (T-0)
   6.6.1. The FDO, Air Force contact officer, and other subject matter experts as necessary,
   will develop a security plan that documents access controls to information and facilities
   within the organization and installation. (T-0) See Attachment 10 for a sample security
   plan.
   6.6.2. The FDO and Air Force contact officer will initially determine any other locations the
   assigned visitor may be required to visit during the term of his assignment to carry out
   responsibilities and duties under the approved position description. (T-0) The FDO and Air
   Force contact officer will periodically review the initial determination. (T-0)
       6.6.2.1. Recurring visits for APEP, ESEP, MPEP, and CPP may be directly arranged
       between Air Force organizations. SAF/IAPD also supports directly arranged visits with
       other Services and Defense Agencies for MPEP and CPP. However, Air Force contact
       officers must comply with the policies and regulations of the Service or Agency to be
       visited. (T-0) Air Force contact officers will coordinate visits with their servicing FDOs,
       and they will ensure disclosure guidance is in place prior to the commencement of the
       visit. (T-0) FDOs will use SPAN procedures to coordinate these visits. (T-0)
       6.6.2.2. Recurring visits to various locations for FLOs and CLOs are requested by their
       governments via SPAN.
6.7. Approving Extended Visit Requests. FDOs shall not approve extended visit requests until
verifying that an appropriate agreement or LOA authorizing the extended position exists. (T-0)
   6.7.1. FDOs will approve the release of CMI and CUI in accordance with delegated
   disclosure authority to support the assignment. (T-0)
   6.7.2. FDOs will document disclosure guidance for each visit. (T-0) This guidance will be
   provided to the U.S. contact officer for the visit and to information addressees, as necessary.
   (T-1)
   6.7.3. FDOs will brief Air Force contact officers on their responsibilities related to visitors
   assigned on an extended basis. (T-0)
AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014                                                                          31


   6.7.4. FDOs will maintain a file for each extended visit made to organizations that they
   support. (T-0) At a minimum, files will include a copy of the extended visit request (if the
   FDO is not an on-line SPAN user), verification of the legal basis for the visit, the security
   plan, and coordination and approval records for MPEP and CPP visits to other locations. (T-
   0) FDOs shall notify the requester when a visit has been approved. (T-0) The FDO will also
   provide the requester the name and telephone number of the visit point of contact and the
   terms of the visit approval.
6.8. Security Requirements.
   6.8.1. Access to CMI and CUI depends on the security clearance granted by the visitor’s
   government, need-to-know, and disclosure guidance issued by the contact officer’s servicing
   FDO.
   6.8.2. Exchange personnel shall not have personal custody of classified or controlled
   unclassified information. (T-0)
   6.8.3. FLOs may have custody of classified information as stipulated in the authorizing
   agreement that establishes their position and subject to the following conditions:
       6.8.3.1. FLOs may assume custody of documentary information when authorized in
       writing by their government, provided U.S. security personnel exercise oversight over the
       storage container. This oversight is similar to that executed by U.S. security personnel
       over U.S. storage containers.
       6.8.3.2. FLOs may act as couriers only when they are authorized in writing by their
       government to assume responsibility as an agent of their government. The FLO’s
       government is required to provide all necessary courier credentials.
6.9. Access to Air Force Facilities and Installations.
   6.9.1. Air Force personnel will not approve unescorted access for foreign representatives to
   Air Force restricted or controlled areas or other facilities where access to CMI or CUI will or
   may occur, unless all of the following conditions have been met: (T-0)
       6.9.1.1. The foreign national’s government extends commensurate reciprocal privileges
       to DoD personnel.
       6.9.1.2. The foreign national is sponsored by his or her government or international
       organization through a formal visit request, and the need for frequent access is justified.
       6.9.1.3. Security measures are in place to limit access to only CMI and CUI authorized
       for disclosure.
       6.9.1.4. A badge or pass is issued that clearly identifies the bearer as a foreign
       representative. Such identification will be valid only for a specific facility during normal
       duty hours. Air Force contact officers will make specific arrangements for access during
       non-duty hours on a case-by-case basis, with the FDO and all offices having a functional
       interest in the extended duty hours. (T-0)
       6.9.1.5. The badge or pass will be displayed on the outer clothing so that it is clearly
       visible. (T-1)
 32                                                                    AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014


   6.9.2. Base access is a security issue and is not the responsibility of FDOs. For base access,
   each base should follow AFI 31-113, Installation Perimeter Access Control, and local
   Security Forces to determine proper base access procedures.
6.10. Air Force Contact Officer Responsibilities. Air Force officials designated as contact
officers for extended visits will: (T-1)
   6.10.1. Maintain a file for each extended visit for which they are the contact officer. At a
   minimum, the file will include a copy of the extended visit authorization, verification of the
   basis for the visit, the security plan, certification form signed by the foreign national, and any
   coordination or approval records for visits to other locations;
   6.10.2. Ensure the visitor understands his or her duties, the terms and conditions of physical
   access to the organization, and obligations, rights, and responsibilities;
   6.10.3. Ensure the visitor signs the certification form (See sample certifications at
   Attachment 9);
   6.10.4. Ensure the visitor is provided access only to that CMI and CUI that has been
   authorized by the FDO in order to perform assigned duties;
   6.10.5. Ensure the visitor’s coworkers are informed of the limitations on visitors’ access to
   information; and
   6.10.6. Advise the servicing FDO of any changes regarding the position or visitor.
6.11. Termination of Visit Approvals. FDOs will monitor visit approvals and will terminate
all approvals at the conclusion of the visit period or when the visit purpose is concluded. (T-0)
FDOs will ensure all offices having a functional interest in the visit are notified of the
termination. (T-0)
AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014                                                                            33

                                 TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

7.1. Introduction. Controls are necessary to ensure exports are consistent with U.S. national
security interests. By law, export controls are placed on defense articles and services or
commercially available items that have a military utility. The Department of State (DoS)
controls exports of defense articles, services, technical data, etc., under the International Traffic
in Arms Regulations (ITAR). The Department of Commerce controls exports of dual use
commodities with military utility under the Export Administration Regulation (EAR).
SAF/IAPD is the Air Force office of primary responsibility for developing the Air Force position
on commercial exports of defense articles and services, dual-use technology, and technical data.
7.2. ITAR Licensing Requirements. By law, the U.S. Government and contractors must
comply with the provisions of the ITAR before exporting defense articles, technical data, or
defense services controlled by the ITAR. (T-0)
   7.2.1. Exports by Air Force Organizations. Air Force organizations are not authorized to
   export CMI or CUI without an export license. Exceptions are described in paragraph 7.4.1
   below.
   7.2.2. Exports by U.S. Industry. A license or other approval issued by the DoS is required in
   order for U.S. industry to export defense articles, services, or technical data. DoS issues
   licenses or other approvals to registered persons who apply for authority to export defense
   articles or furnish defense services. DoS may approve the application based on its own
   evaluation, or it may request recommendations from the Defense Technology Security
   Administration (DTSA). If necessary, DTSA may request Service or DoD Agency
   recommendations regarding proposed exports of defense articles, services, and technical
   data.     SAF/IAPD is the Air Force organization responsible for making such
   recommendations to DTSA.
       7.2.2.1. SAF/IAPD evaluates political and military, operational, technical, and security
       factors for proposed industry exports on a case-by-case basis.
       7.2.2.2. SAF/IAPD coordinates industry export requests with subject matter experts as
       needed.
   7.2.3. Exports by U.S. Industry in Support of Air Force Organizations. Consistent with the
   ITAR, SAF/ IAPD may certify use of license exemptions to approve contractor support for
   government-to-government programs when the contractor does not have an approved export
   license. SAF/IAPD will consider and may certify exemptions to licensing requirements for
   contractors on a case-by-case basis only, subject to paragraph 7.4.2 below.
7.3. Air Force Requests for Export Licenses. Air Force disclosures and technology transfers
are approved by designated FDOs pursuant to the conditions in paragraph 7.4.1.1 and 7.4.1.2
below. Therefore, licenses issued by DoS are usually not required. However, circumstances
may exist when Air Force organizations will require a license. The following provides guidance
to determine when the Air Force must obtain an export license from the DoS.
   7.3.1. Licenses are required to employ foreign nationals either as civil servants or under
   contract. Air Force organizations must obtain DoS approval through SAF/IAPD prior to
 34                                                                   AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014


   employing foreign nationals in positions requiring access to CUI. (T-0) Personnel in the
   rank of Colonel or higher (military) or GS-15 or higher (civilian) must sign the request. (T-0)
   The written request identifies the following:
       7.3.1.1. The foreign national’s name, citizenship, and identification number,
       7.3.1.2. Justification why the foreign national employment is essential to the national
       security of the United States,
       7.3.1.3. Skills, knowledge or abilities the foreign national possesses that are otherwise
       not available from U.S. domestic sources,
       7.3.1.4. Proposed disclosure guidance to support the foreign national’s access to CUI.
   7.3.2. This requirement will not apply to foreign nationals who only require access to CUI
   and have been granted permanent legal resident status in the United States.
   7.3.3. SAF/IAPD will not favorably consider submitting a license application to support
   foreign national access to CMI.
7.4. Exemptions to Licensing Requirements. License exemptions are designed to ease the
regulatory burden on government and industry without compromising essential trade controls.
   7.4.1. Air Force organizations are not required to obtain an export license issued by the DoS
   when exporting defense articles including technical data or to perform defense services in the
   following cases.
       7.4.1.1. Exports pursuant to a grant, sale, lease, loan, or cooperative project under the
       Arms Export Control Act, or a sale, lease, or loan under the Foreign Assistance Act of
       1961, as amended. Formal approval of foreign military sales programs or international
       cooperation agreements provides the basis for Air Force exports of CMI or CUI to
       foreign governments or international organizations.
       7.4.1.2. Exports of CMI or CUI to foreign representatives assigned to Air Force
       organizations under MPEP, ESEP, APEP, or CPP agreements or as a FLO under an FMS
       case.
       7.4.1.3. Combined military operations and training.
       7.4.1.4. Unilateral U.S. military operations abroad.
   7.4.2. SAF/IAPD may certify the use of exemptions, consistent with DoD guidelines for
   certifying exemptions, for defense contractors on a case-by-case basis in the following cases:
       7.4.2.1. The services of private U.S. persons or companies are required pursuant to
       activities enumerated in paragraphs 7.4.1.1 through 7.4.1.4.
       7.4.2.2. Air Force requires the participation of private U.S. persons or companies in
       initial planning discussions/negotiations with foreign governments and international
       organizations pursuant to the activities enumerated in paragraphs 7.4.1.1 through 7.4.1.4
       7.4.2.3. It is in the Air Force’s interest to authorize private U.S. persons or companies to
       solicit subcontract proposals from foreign firms for the purpose of developing responses
       to Service acquisition authority requests for quote or bid proposals.
AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014                                                                         35


     7.4.2.4. Exports of classified and unclassified technical data in conjunction with
     classified and unclassified plant visits.
  7.4.3. In order to request an exemption certification for a U.S. private person or company,
  the sponsoring Air Force office forwards an official written request through disclosure
  channels to SAF/IAPD. The request must be signed by a senior management official, at least
  a Colonel or higher (military) or GS-15 or higher (civilian) and will be accompanied by a
  completed “USAF ITAR Exemption Certification Checklist” (Attachment 15). (T-0) The
  written request identifies the following:
     7.4.3.1. Name of the U.S. person or company for which the exemption certification is
     requested;
     7.4.3.2. Reason for requesting the exemption certification (e.g., cite LOA number,
     MOU/MOA title or contract number if applicable), benefit to the United States, urgency
     of request (critical program milestones or decision process) in lieu of normal ITAR
     processes, and status or relationship of U.S. person or company export license or

     data to be provided by the company in support of the activities listed in paragraph 7.4.2;
     and
     7.4.3.4. A copy of all briefings, documents, or information to be disclosed by the
     individual or company. If it is impractical to attach the actual information, a detailed
     description of the subject matter (including NDP category and highest classification of
     the information) may be forwarded. Alternatively, a statement by the servicing FDO
     certifying the material proposed for release is authorized for disclosure under an existing
     DDL will suffice. (ITAR Exemption Checklist, Attachment 15)
  7.4.4. Exemption certification requests will be approved in writing by SAF/IAPD and
  include the following elements:
     7.4.4.1. ITAR exemption number;

     from license requirement;
     7.4.4.5. Conditions and limitations necessary to establish a clearly defined scope for
     defense articles, services, and technical data authorized for export; and
     7.4.4.6. An expiration date (no more than 1 year from date of issue).
  7.4.5. Upon receipt of the approved exemption, the servicing FDO will: (T-0)
 36                                                                  AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014


      7.4.5.1. Record the decision to sponsor the visit in SPAN when a foreign visit is
      involved, and identify the SAF/IAPD approved exemption as authority to sponsor the
      visit;
      7.4.5.2. Review all briefings, documents, and other information proposed for release by
      contractors, if the actual briefings, documents, etc., have not been provided to
      SAF/IAPD; and
      7.4.5.3. Ensure an Air Force representative familiar with the program (military or
      civilian employee) is present at all activities to ensure contractor compliance with the
      terms and conditions of the exemption.
7.5. Nonsponsored and Sponsored Foreign Visits to U. S. Defense Industry.
   7.5.1. FDOs will generally not sponsor foreign requests to visit U.S. defense facilities.

   Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations (EAR).
   7.5.2. FDOs will only sponsor foreign visit requests to U.S. defense facilities after obtaining
   SAF/ IAPD approval for the required license exemption certification in accordance with
   paragraph 7.4.3. (T-0)
AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014                                                                           37


                                            Chapter 8

      AIR FORCE PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES WITH FOREIGN INDUSTRY

8.1. Introduction. U.S. acquisition reform established a hierarchy of potential alternatives that
must be evaluated before commitment to a newly started acquisition program. The first
alternative is to assess the use or modification of an existing commercial system, or an already
developed U.S. military or allied nation system that would alleviate the necessity for a weapons
development program. Since U.S. defense procurements may include foreign sources, it is
important that foreign disclosure and technology transfer requirements are addressed prior to
contract award.
8.2. Reviewing Planned U. S. Procurements.
   8.2.1. Air Force contracting authorities announce planned Air Force procurements on the
   Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.FedBizOpps.gov. Contracting
   authorities will coordinate invitations to bid, requests for proposals, pre-solicitation, pre-
   bidders, pre-proposal, and pre-award meetings etc., with their servicing FDO prior to
   announcing procurement activities so that restrictions can be identified to foreign bidders.
   (T-0)
       8.2.1.1. FDOs identify necessary restrictions on foreign participation before the
       procurement is announced on the FBO website. (T-1)
       8.2.1.2. When it is not possible to review all procurements prior to the FBO
       announcement, Contracting Officers must ensure announcements include notification that
       restrictions regarding foreign bidders may be placed on the contract. Also, foreign
       bidders will be instructed to indicate interest in the procurement to the contracting officer
       prior to submitting a proposal. Once foreign interest is identified, FDOs must review the
       procurement announcement in a timely manner so that foreign bidders can submit
       proposals to meet contracting office submission deadlines. (T-0)
       8.2.1.3. Prime contractors are responsible for obtaining authorization to disclose CMI
       and CUI to foreign sub-contractors pursuant to the Department of State’s ITAR or
       Department of Commerce’s EAR.
       8.2.1.4. The Overseas Workload Program (OWLP) is managed by HQ AFMC/A4 and
       outside the purview of FDO review. Questions should be directed to HQ AFMC/A4.
       (See AFMCI 21-201, The Overseas Workload Program, para 1.3.1.1.)
   8.2.2. The Defense Security Service (DSS) reviews foreign ownership, control, or influence
   (FOCI) of U.S. companies that access or store U.S. classified military information under the
   authority of the National Industrial Security Program (NISP). This review evaluates a
   number of risk factors in order to determine an appropriate course of action to negate or
   mitigate FOCI. Unless FOCI can be negated or national security risks mitigated, a company
   may have its ability to access or store classified information suspended or cancelled.
       8.2.2.1. There are no contract restrictions from a disclosure perspective on the types of
       contracts that may be awarded to a company who has negated its FOCI using a Voting
       Trust Agreement or Proxy Agreement, or mitigated its FOCI risk through a Board
       Resolution or Security Control Agreement.
 38                                                               AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014


      8.2.2.2. Companies who mitigate FOCI using a Special Security Agreement may be
      awarded most types of classified contracts. However, contracts requiring access to
      proscribed information (i.e., Sensitive Compartmented Information, COMSEC,
      Restricted Data, Special Access Programs, Top Secret) are not awarded unless there is an
      overriding national interest to support the contract award and the associated risks are
      minimal.
         8.2.2.2.1. Companies who mitigate FOCI using a Limited Facility Clearance will be
         restricted to work on a specific contract or program that originates with or involves
         the government of the country from which the FOCI is derived.
      8.2.2.3. FDOs must maintain constant relationship with the DSS on all FOCI matters.
      (T-0)
8.3. Appeals Regarding Decisions to Exclude Foreign Contractors. FDOs will forward
foreign requests to appeal denials through channels to SAF/IAPD. (T-0)
AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014                                                                         39


                                           Chapter 9

                               SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

9.1. Introduction. This chapter provides guidance for reporting compromises of both United
States and foreign classified information and unauthorized access to controlled unclassified
military information. Personnel must understand these requirements to ensure that Air Force
responsibilities under Executive Order 13526, as amended and General Security of Military
Information Agreements with foreign countries are executed properly.
9.2. Reporting Compromises of Classified Information
   9.2.1. Any Air Force activity aware of known or suspected compromises of United States or
   foreign government classified information must notify SAF/IAPD and make initial
   notifications in accordance with DoDM 5200.01, Volumes 1-4, Information Security
   Program, and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. (T-0) SAF/AAZ
   will notify SAF/IAPD of any reports of compromises or probable compromises of NATO
   classified information, foreign government classified information or U.S. classified
   information to or by foreign representatives.
   9.2.2. At the conclusion of an Air Force evaluation, damage assessment, or investigation, Air
   Force officials authorized to finally approve or close out investigations will furnish one copy
   of the complete investigation or damage assessment to SAF/IAPD. (T-0)
9.3. Reporting Unauthorized Access to Controlled Unclassified Information. Any Air Force
activity aware of a known or suspected unauthorized access to U.S. CUI by a foreign
government, international organization, or their representative must notify SAF/IAPD through
disclosure channels. (T-0)
   9.3.1. Notifications will identify where the access occurred, specific information accessed,
   individual, group, or organization permitting access, facts and circumstances surrounding the
   unauthorized access, and impact of the unauthorized access on the U.S. (T-0)
   9.3.2. SAF/IAPD will evaluate reports of unauthorized access and determine actions to be
   taken.
   9.3.3. Suspected instances of fraud, abuse, bribery, or other violations of the Arms Export
   Control Act and implementing regulations; other laws governing exports or illicit diversions
   of U.S. export-controlled technology, articles, or services will be reported to the Air Force
   Office of Special Investigations. (T-0)

Classified Information—Information that has been determined pursuant to Executive Order
13526 or any predecessor order to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and is
marked to indicate its classified status when in documentary form.
 44                                                                   AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014


Classified Military Equipment—Military equipment that is itself classified; contains classified
information that may be derived from or revealed by its operation or testing; or will require the
disclosure of classified information for operation, employment, maintenance, or training.
Classified Military Information (CMI)—Information originated by or for, or under the
jurisdiction or control of, the Department of Defense or its Agencies which requires protection in
the interest of national security. CMI is designated TOP SECRET, SECRET or
CONFIDENTIAL as described in Executive Order 13526 or subsequent order. CMI includes
information in tangible (e.g., equipment, documents, software, etc.) and in intangible (e.g.,
knowledge, know—how, expertise, etc.) form. Eight categories of CMI (see Attachment 2) are
subject to national disclosure policy control.
Certification—Formal recognition by a DoD Component of a working relationship with a
representative of a foreign government (e.g., a foreign liaison officer) for specified purposes and
on a recurring basis over an agreed period of time. UNITED STATES AIR FORCE certification
of foreign nationals is established by approval of an extended visit request.
Combined Military Information—Military information that, by agreement, is shared by the
United States and another government or international organization, regardless of which party to
the agreement produces the information. (Combined military information may result or originate
from specific projects which the United States and another government agree to conduct so that
the different phases of the project are undertaken separately; one government will assume sole
project responsibility on behalf of both; or the best results of independent endeavors will be
adopted.)
Contact Officer—A DoD official designated in writing to oversee and control all contacts,
requests for information, consultations, access, and other activities of foreign nationals who are
assigned to, or are visiting, a DoD Component or subordinate organization. In the case of
MPEPs, the host supervisor may be the contact officer.
Contractor—Any industrial, educational, commercial, or other entity which has executed a
contract or a DD Form 441, DoD Security Agreement, with a DoD activity.
Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)—Unclassified information, including technical
data (see explanation of term) to which access or distribution limitations have been applied in
accordance with U.S. laws, policies, and regulations. It includes information that is determined to
be exempt from public disclosure in accordance with DoD Directives 5320.25 and 5400.7 or that
is subject to export controls in accordance with the ITAR or the EAR. Not all controlled
unclassified information is owned by the military. For example, defense contractors control
company confidential or proprietary information. Unclassified export controlled technical data,
as defined by the ITAR, is CUI. CUI include information in tangible (e.g., equipment,
documents, software, etc.) and intangible (e.g., knowledge, know-how, expertise, etc.) form.
Cooperative Program—A program for research, development, test, evaluation, and/or
production that is not implemented under the Security Assistance Program.
Cooperative Program Personnel (CPP)—Foreign government personnel, assigned to a
multinational program office that is hosted by a DoD Component pursuant to the terms of a
Cooperative Program International Agreement, who report to and take direction from a DoD-
appointed Program Manager (or Program Manager equivalent) for the purpose of carrying out a
AFI16-201 23 JULY 2014                                                                          45
