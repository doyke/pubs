                                          Chapter 1

                                 POLICY AND CONCEPTS

1.1. Introduction
   1.1.1. This AFI provides guidance for geographic, functional, and ARC aligned AOC
   training programs. Guidance for geographic AOCs is applicable to Rapid Augmentation
   Team (RAT) as established by AF Program Action Directive (PAD) 10-2, Direction to
   Restructure Command and Control of Component Numbered Air Forces.
       1.1.1.1. Chapter 1 lists general training guidance applicable to all AOCs. Specific AOC
       and ARC aligned AOC units training program requirements are explained in Chapter 2.
       Due to the nature of their organizational structure and differing processes, functional
       AOC training program requirements will be addressed in functional MAJCOM/unit
       supplements.
       1.1.1.2. ARC unit CCs will ensure their annual training plans include training to
       maintain worldwide deploy ability.
   1.1.2. This AFI outlines AOC training concept, structure and responsibilities.
   1.1.3. This AFI applies to AOC crewmembers to include specialty teams and also establishes
   required orientation training for liaison/augmentation personnel.
       1.1.3.1. AOC crewmembers, to include specialty teams, fill operational mission essential
       positions in the AOC. These positions are listed in AFI 13-1AOCV3, AOC Organization
       and Operational Procedures. AOC crewmembers may be military, civilian, or contractor
       personnel and are permanently assigned to active duty or ARC AOC units. Additionally,
       due to AOC manning constraints and unique theater or functional requirements, AOC
       units may require locally developed crewmember positions supporting a combatant
       commander that are not identified in AFI 13-1AOCV3. Unique positions and training
       associated with these positions will be identified in a unit supplement to this AFI.
       1.1.3.2. Liaison/augmentation personnel may represent other weapon systems,
       components, commands, government agencies, or coalition partners.              They are
       administratively subordinate to their parent organizations while working within the AOC
       and will receive orientation training from the host AOC. Orientation training specifics
       are outlined in paragraph 2.3 of this AFI.
       1.1.3.3. Augmentees on temporary assignment to a host AOC Commander (AOC/CC)
       must receive locally developed orientation training by the host AOC.
   1.1.4. This AFI directs formal appointment of AOC trainers with a unit developed trainer
   training program. Guidance on AOC trainer training can be found in paragraph 2.4 of this
   AFI.
Note: AOC crewmember training, as outlined in this AFI, is a separate program from Air Force
On-the-Job Training (OJT). OJT is governed by AFI 36-2201 Vol 3, Air Force Training
Program On-the-Job Training Administration, and documented on the AF Form 623, On-the-Job
Training Record or other AF approved system (for enlisted members only). There is a potential

overlap of training requirements and events. Even so, AOC training and career field training
documentation are separate programs.
1.2. General
     1.2.1. AOC training: There are two overarching categories of AOC training, crewmember
     and orientation training. AOC crewmember training consists of Initial Qualification Training
     (IQT) and Mission Qualification Training (MQT) for all AOC crewmembers qualifying to
     Combat Mission Ready (CMR). Upon receipt of CMR designation, all AOC CMR
     crewmembers will then complete Continuation Training (CT) requirements IAW paragraph
     2.2.3. Additionally, each unit will conduct orientation training as outlined in paragraph 2.3
     of this AFI for augmentees and liaison personnel.
     1.2.2. All training will be documented (See paragraph 2.5 of this AFI). Units will document
     IQT and MQT in the AOC learning management system (LMS) utilizing electronic AF Form
     4141, Individuals’ Record of Duties and Experience, Ground Environment Personnel.
     Functional communities such as Intelligence, Cyber, and Information Operations, may use
     command directed LMS systems to track IQT, MQT, and CT as long as the system provides
     equivalent information and is accessible to AOC training management personnel.
     Continuation training (CT) will be documented on locally developed tracking systems, other
     (Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) compliant) electronic storage means,
     or LMS AF Form 4142, Individual Annual Training Record, when developed. Units may
     maintain manual training folders as backups only. Units will maintain IQT/MQT training
     documentation on personnel until PCS and forward to next unit if at an AOC. Following
     award of CMR status, IQT/MQT training documentation and certificates may be maintained
     in unit developed grade books, or maintained in unit developed training folders. Award of
     CMR will be documented IAW AFI 13-1AOC, Volume 2, AOC Standards and Evaluation.
     Additionally, this CMR will be annotated by training personnel on AF Form 4141.
        1.2.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) The 614 AOC is not required to use LMS, they are authorized
        to use their own locally developed training tracking system.
     1.2.3. All AOCs and affiliated units will have an annual training plan (ATP). An example
     can be found on the AOC community of practice (CoP) page (see attachment 2, Glossary of
     Links for the CoP address).
     1.2.4. Any reference to "days" means calendar days. The training year coincides with the
     fiscal year (FY).
     1.2.5. Any reference to Formal Training Unit (FTU), unless stated otherwise, is intended to
     mean the FTU at Hurlburt Field, FL, operated by the 505th Command and Control Wing
     (CCW).
1.3. Responsibilities
1.3. (AFSPC)Responsibilities. Commanders at every level are responsible for ensuring the
personnel and organizations under their cognizance are qualified and certified to perform their
mission essential tasks (METs) to established competency and proficiency standards. METs are
derived by commanders from mission analysis. Unit METs and training programs are developed
to support lesson-learned feedback on CCDR operational requirements, priorities and Joint
Mission Essential Task Lists (JMETs). See CJCSI 3500.01, Joint Training Policy and Guidance
AFI13-1AOCV1_AFSPCSUP_I 18 JANUARY 2013                                                      7

                                           Chapter 2

                                AOC TRAINING PROGRAM

2.1. Introduction: This chapter provides AOC training requirements with program details for
Geographic AOCs and their ARC aligned units. Functional AOCs will abide by this chapter
unless otherwise identified in their Unit/MAJCOM supplement, which will take precedence, and
no waiver is required.
   2.1.1. Crewmember training is a sequential, three-phased program to reach and maintain
   CMR status. Phases are: IQT, MQT, and CT.
   2.1.1. (AFSPC) This chapter provides 614 AOC training requirements. In accordance with
   AFI 13-1 Vol 1 paragraph 2.1., as a functional AOC, 614 AOC will rewrite chapter 2 of the
   AFI13-1 Vol 1 to be used in conjunction with this AFSPC supplement. The 614 AOC
   supplement will replace the existing AFI 13-1 Vol 1 Chapter 2. The 614 AOC Chapter 2 will
   include and expand upon the following AFSPC chapter 2 to further define their training
   requirements.
   2.1.2. Orientation training contains portions of the sequential three-phased crewmember
   training program tailored to the crewmember’s individual experience. Orientation training
   may result in awarding of CMR Status and awarding of a SEI upon training completion.
2.2. Crewmember Training Program
2.2. (AFSPC)Crewmember Training Program. Training Concept Overview
   2.2.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT):
   2.2.1. (AFSPC) In order to gain efficiencies and reduce operations and training costs, units
   will standardize operational concepts, processes, procedures, training, and evaluation
   programs to the extent practical. Requirements and standards must be limited to that
   required to efficiently and effectively enable mission success. Units will ensure the
   following standardization requirements are met:
       2.2.1.1. IQT provides the training necessary to qualify AOC crew-members in a generic
       division/team level position without regard to a specific AOC’s mission. Upon
       completion of IQT, crewmembers attain BQ status and are awarded the appropriate AOC
       SEI. BQ is the qualification status of an AOC crew member who has satisfactorily
       completed IQT and is qualified to perform AOC divisional/team duties. The member
       must meet the minimum academic and performance standards set forth by the AOC
       weapons system FTU. BQ is not a long-term status nor does it imply position specific
       expertise; individuals are required to continue training progressing to MQT to improve
       and attain proficiency on positional duties and tasks related to their unit’s mission.
          2.2.1.1.1. AOCs must request a waiver from their MAJCOM OPR for each
          individual unable to attend FTU. Personnel waived from FTU attendance must
          complete In-Unit IQT (IUIQT). IUIQT will be accomplished using the FTU course
          syllabus and materials to the maximum extent possible within unit resources.
          2.2.1.1.2. Not all AOC duty positions are accommodated by FTU in-residence
          courses (List located on AOC CoP - See Attachment 2). For those that are standard
AFI13-1AOCV1_AFSPCSUP_I 18 JANUARY 2013                                                     17


        but not taught at the FTU, ACC/A3C or MAJCOM OPR is responsible for
        development of a MAJCOM approved IQT program. For those non-AFI 13-1AOC,
        volume 3 crew positions unique to their AOC/CCDR, IQT development is a unit
        responsibility. For AMD positions not accommodated by the FTU a list is posted on
        the AMD Training CoP, see Attachment 2.
        2.2.1.1.3. Attending IQT enroute to the AOC permanent change of station (PCS)
        location is the preferred method IAW this AFI. AOC TMs must ensure this occurs to
        the maximum extent possible. If IQT enroute to PCS is not an option, contact the
        gaining unit MAJCOM POC who will then coordinate with ACC/A3CT.
     2.2.1.2. Purpose: IQT provides foundational knowledge, skills, and context for follow-on
     training. IQT provides basic skills to all AOC crewmembers in order for them to work in
     an AOC, but does not provide theater specifics. Crewmember theater duty requirements
     will be acquired through unit MQT program.
     2.2.1.3. Method: IQT will consist of students taking the advanced distributed learning
     (ADL) lessons in LMS and an FTU course. AOC crewmembers will attend the FTU in-
     residence unless otherwise noted on AOC CoP or approved MAJCOM supplement for
     functional AOCs. Members learning a secondary AOC duty position will be allowed to
     return to the FTU with MAJCOM OPR and ACC/A3CT coordination and approval.
        2.2.1.3.1. There are only four courses currently approved as ―in-lieu–of‖ courses for
        prescribed FTU courses: The USAF Weapons School Space Superiority course at
        Nellis AFB, NV for AOC space personnel; the Advanced Study of Air Mobility
        (ASAM) course at the USAF Air Expeditionary Center at McGuire AFB, NJ; the
        SAASS at Maxwell AFB, AL for Strategy Division personnel; and the C/JSSC
        Course at Hurlburt Field, FL, for Division Chiefs. These courses include AOC and
        AOC process training which are applicable to the positions these crewmembers
        normally work. These and any new ―in–lieu-of‖ courses may be found on the AOC
        CoP.
        2.2.1.3.2. AOC crewmember positions are mapped to FTU and ―in-lieu–of‖ courses
        on the AOC CoP.
     2.2.1.4. Timeline: Crewmembers attending FTU will complete IQT upon graduation.
     IUIQT will be completed within 120 days from start date for active duty personnel and
     18 months for ARC personnel. IUIQT must be started no later than 30 days (180 days for
     ARC personnel) following date arrived station (DAS). If necessary for mission
     accomplishment, IUIQT may be completed prior to FTU attendance, but IQT SEI should
     not be awarded until crewmember attends FTU.
     2.2.1.5. Exceptions: Exceptions to the IQT timeline may occur via extension or
     incomplete result in training. Note: IQT is a onetime event and an individual returning to
     an AOC assignment after having previously accomplished IQT need not re-accomplish
     this phase. They must still complete appropriate training outlined by unit training
     manager following records review. This is not a waiver and the original IQT completion
     date remains in effect. Qualification in a new AOC position may require a different IQT
     or FTU class, in which case IQT may be reaccomplished for the new position.

       Attendance in new FTU class will require AOC TM request, MAJCOM POC and
       ACC/A3CT approval.
          2.2.1.5.1. Extension: AOC/CCs may grant a single 30-day extension (ARC aligned
          unit commanders may grant 180 days) for completion of IQT. Following the
          AOC/CC extension, the CC, upon review of the individual’s training to date, may
          request an additional extension from MAJCOM OPR of 30 days. If after the
          AOC/CC and/or MAJCOM OPR extensions, training is still not complete, the
          commander has two options: either reenter the individual into training (restart the
          clock) or drop the individual from AOC training permanently. Both options are
          mandatory reporting items to the MAJCOM OPR and ACC/A3CT.
          2.2.1.5.2. Incomplete: Students unable to finish an FTU course for other than
          performance issues (e.g., medical reasons, etc.) may be reentered into a subsequent
          class with 505 TRS/CC recommendation, unit CC, and ACC/A3CT concurrence.
          2.2.1.5.3. Failure: FTU IQT failure is a mandatory reporting item by the 505 TRS to
          the reporting unit, the MAJCOM OPR, and ACC/A3CT. The following gaining unit
          commander options are available for IQT failure:
              2.2.1.5.3.1. Due to extenuating circumstances, return individual to the FTU with
              505 TRS/CC recommendations; gaining unit CC, MAJCOM OPR, and
              ACC/A3CT approval.
              2.2.1.5.3.2. End training and place individual in a unit non AOC crewmember
              position.
Note: A student who failed an FTU IQT course may not be subsequently enrolled in IUIQT.
   2.2.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT)
   2.2.2. (AFSPC) Commanders and managers at all levels must ensure the personnel and
   organizations under their cognizance are qualified and certified to perform to established
   competency and proficiency standards. Training objectives must be developed and defined
   in terms of conditions, required behavior, and standards of acceptable performance.
       2.2.2.1. Definition: MQT provides the training necessary to qualify or requalify AOC
       crewmembers in a specific position to perform the missions assigned to a specific AOC.
       MQT is a unit responsibility. AOC crewmembers maintain BQ status until they complete
       MQT. Completion of MQT is a prerequisite for attaining CMR status.
       2.2.2.2. Purpose: The purpose of MQT is to prepare a crewmember for attainment of
       CMR status in a specific AOC duty position.
       2.2.2.3. Method: MQT normally involves tailored training with a trainer plus applicable
       subject matter experts (SMEs), classroom academics, self-study, and practice as
       necessary. Each AOC will determine the best mix of methods to meet all MQT training
       needs. ACC/A3C and parent MAJCOMs will manage the development and use of MQT
       course materials and TTLs. TTLs for AFI 13-1AOCV3 crewmember positions must be
       approved and standardized by HQ ACC/A3C in coordination with appropriate theater or
       functional MAJCOM. WS standardized MQT Training 797s; program of instruction,
       etc., along with execution guidance will be posted to the AOC CoP and considered an
       extension of this AFI as minimum guidance.
AFI13-1AOCV1_AFSPCSUP_I 18 JANUARY 2013                                                    19


       2.2.2.4. Timeline: MQT must be started NLT 45 days from IQT completion (90 days for
       ARC personnel). First term airmen will complete the first term airmen course then have
       30 days for entry into MQT. In all cases, MQT must be complete within 90 days of start
       (ARC personnel have 365 days to complete) of MQT.
       2.2.2.5. MQT is complete when all training requirements are complete and the individual
       is released to unit Stan/Eval. A crewmember will achieve CMR status when Stan/Eval
       has completed its evaluation process and the AOC/CC or designate (not lower than AOC
       Division Chief level) signs the appropriate paperwork.
       2.2.2.6. Portions may be accomplished before formal entry into MQT; however, MQT
       may not be completed out of sequence (i.e., prior to IQT complete).
       2.2.2.7. MQT may not be waived.
       2.2.2.8. Extensions: Extensions to the MQT timeline may occur as follows: The
       Commander may approve one 30-day extension (180 days for ARC units). Following a
       unit CC extension, the MAJCOM OPR may grant an additional 30 day (ARC 180 days)
       extension.
       2.2.2.9. Incomplete/failure to progress: If training is not complete after Unit/CC and
       MAJCOM OPR extensions, the CC must remove the individual from training and assign
       to a non-AOC crewmember position.
       2.2.2.10. Upon CMR certification it is incumbent on the AOC TM to ensure appropriate
       SEI code has been changed from the generic non-CMR SEI to the applicable AOC CMR
       SEI.
   2.2.3. Continuation Training (CT)
   2.2.3. (AFSPC) Units will use ISD to develop training systems, by following guidance
   found in AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional System Development, AFMAN 36-2236,
   Guidebook for Air Force Instructors, and applicable volumes of AFH 36-2235, Information
   for Designers of Instructional Systems.
       2.2.3.1. Definition: CT provides crewmembers with the volume, frequency, and mix of
       training necessary to maintain CMR proficiency in their assigned position. CT begins
       after a crewmember has attained CMR status. Units are responsible for developing an
       annual CT plan focusing on the units’ mission or support for any upcoming major
       exercises. These plans will be approved by AOC/CC and submitted to appropriate
       MAJCOM for review and additional guidance.
Note: Mandatory AF training generally referred to as ancillary training may not be counted
toward CT. ARC units will accomplish standardized academic CT (IAW Attachment 3) over a
two-year vice one-year period. Thus, quarterly requirements become semi-annual; semi-annual
become annual requirements, and annual requirements become bi-annual for ARC aligned units.

       2.2.3.2. Content: AOCs have common CT requirements levied by MAJCOM OPR;
       however, each is expected to add unique CT requirements to their ATP. General CT
       requirement table is at Attachment 3. AOCs have general CT requirements in the
       following six primary and one AOC/CC categories.

              2.2.3.2.6. Exercise participation
              2.2.3.2.7. Unit CC/Division Chief assigned requirements
         2.2.3.3. Purpose: CT accomplishes two purposes: maintaining AOC positional
         qualification (CMR status) and expanding operational level knowledge and C2 skills. CT
         is the AOC/CC’s and Division Chiefs’ tool to ensure that AOC crewmembers are
         prepared to support CCDR, JFACC, and AADC as required at all times. Crewmembers
         qualified in more than one position must meet CT requirements for each position. Dual
         qualified crewmembers with like CT requirements that are the same for each position
         only need to perform the specific CT requirement for 1 position.
         2.2.3.4. Method: CT may consist of any combination of mass academics, e-learning,
         directed self-study, systems training, positional refresher training, or exercises.
         2.2.3.5. Timeline: CT requirements begin the first duty day of the following month after
         the individual is designated CMR. Requirement completion timeframes can be found in
         Attachment 3 and unit ATPs. CT requirements specific to functional AOCs will be
         addressed in their Unit/MAJCOM supplement. CT may be prorated but is normally not
         waived. Waivers will be evaluated on a case by case basis and approved by MAJCOM
         OPR. ARC units will accomplish CT training over a two-year vice one-year period.
         2.2.3.6. Proration: Units may prorate CT requirements based on initial CMR date,
         TDYs, deployments, or periods of non-AOC duty (e.g., honor guard, medical leave).
         Unit must ensure training is adjusted to account for time assigned (PCS or TDY) to
         contingencies (See Figure 2.1.)
Figure 2.1. Continuation Training Proration Schedule. ARC will use three month = one
month for proration.
CT Periods         CT requirement is prorated if crewmember is unavailable for training (reasons stated above) for
                   more than (or equal to) the following number of days*:

Note: CT periods are tied to calendar. Crewmember non-availability days need not be contiguous to prorate from
CT.

Examples:
(1) Capt Smith becomes CMR on Apr 20.
- Monthly CT for Oct thru Apr are waived;
- Quarterly CT for 1st, and 2nd quarters are waived,

- Semi-Annual CT for the 1st half is waived; For ARC 18 month training is waived.
(2) A1C Jones becomes CMR on Sep 21.
- Monthly CT would start on 1 Oct the beginning of the CT period for all.
- Annual CT is waived and New Year begins 1 Oct.
       2.2.3.7. Failure to meet CT requirements: Failure to meet CT requirements results in
       regression to non-CMR (N-CMR) status. AOC/CCs may allow up to a 30-day grace
       period for the accomplishment of CT requirements. ARC-aligned unit commanders may
       allow up to a 180-day grace period.
           2.2.3.7.1. N-CMR crewmembers may not perform AOC duties unless supervised by
           a CMR crewmember.
           2.2.3.7.2. To regain CMR status, a crewmember must accomplish the delinquent CT.
           The individual's training records must reflect both the regression to N-CMR and the
           reacquisition of CMR status.
           2.2.3.7.3. Failure to regain CMR within 6 months (18 months for ARC) results in
           regression to unqualified status (UQ).
   2.2.4. (Added-AFSPC) It is DoD policy that training is timely, effective and conducted in a
   safe manner to the maximum extent possible. It is also DoD policy that training capabilities
   be based on a DoD training architecture and an open, netcentric, interoperable standard. To
   facilitate this requirement the Standard Space Trainer (SST) was developed as a common
   training platform directed by AFSPC Commander for all CMR space training systems. In
   order to enhance standardization and safety, as well as maximize investment in simulation
   capability, units with a fielded SST simulation capability shall conduct CMR training and
   evaluation performance tests on the SST-based simulation capability to the maximum extent
   possible.
       2.2.4.1. (Added-AFSPC) Non-SST simulation capability, part task trainers and other
       training devices may also be used in an off-line environment when SST-based capability
       is not fielded or does not sufficiently meet all training needs.
       2.2.4.2. (Added-AFSPC) Off-line training/evaluation environment.              Students and
       evaluatees must have training and evaluation environments that allow mistakes to occur
       in order to facilitate learning. Units will make every effort to maximize use of off-line
       training/simulation devices for training and evaluation activities to minimize the impact
       of training and evaluation upon the real-world operational environment. Off-line
       training/simulation devices are those that are physically and electronically separated from
       operational systems.         All processing for the simulation is conducted on
       computers/equipment separate from the operational system. The simulator/training device
       may connect to a dedicated training network to support AF distributed training
       requirements.
       2.2.4.3. (Added-AFSPC) This policy does not preclude the use of operational systems
       for real-world task observation necessary for on-the-job training (OJT), evaluation or
       exercise events, where appropriate. Prior to using operational systems for training,
       evaluation or exercise events, units will ensure processes and procedures are developed to
       preclude simulated data/events from impacting the operational environment or being
AFI13-1AOCV1_AFSPCSUP_I 18 JANUARY 2013                                                        23


       erroneously confused with or considered real-world data/events. A formal and
       documented risk management process should be used to detect, assess, and control risk,
       with risk decisions made at the appropriate level.
       2.2.4.4. (Added-AFSPC) Units may blend live activity with virtual and constructive
       simulations using the Distributed Mission Operations-Space (DMO-S) and/or Space Test
       and Training Range (STTR) capability, as needed, to efficiently achieve unit training and
       exercise objectives.
2.3. Orientation Training
   2.3.1. All AOCs must provide orientation training for TDY AOC crewmembers, specialty
   team members, liaisons, and augmentees to aid their integration. This training will be
   tailored and based on expected duties, previous experience, and AOC knowledge. The
   gaining AOC is responsible to both develop content and present the training.
Note: A CMR rating in any AFI 13-1AOCV3 position is transferrable among the Geographic
AOCs in the same CMR duty position upon completion of unit theater familiarization training.
   2.3.2. Orientation training is a menu of training modules consisting of any combination of e-
   learning lessons, briefings, or directed self-study. This menu is designed by the AOC TM,
   tailored to the individual, and approved by AOC/CC or Division Chief if delegated by CC.
       2.3.2.1. Orientation training is appropriate for CMR AOC crewmembers temporarily
       assigned to another AOC. If the AOC crewmember performs duties in his or her CMR
       position, theater/mission familiarization should be all that is required.
       2.3.2.2. Augmentees from various mission design series (MDS) or other government
       agencies (OGA) may need AOC orientation and other training.
   2.3.2.3. Each AOC will present an orientation training program from which individual items
   are chosen as appropriate and may include the following subject areas:
          2.3.2.3.1. AOC fundamentals
          2.3.2.3.2. Unit mission or theater orientation
          2.3.2.3.3. Chain of command
          2.3.2.3.4. Applicable planning and execution documents
          2.3.2.3.5. Augmentee positional responsibilities
   2.3.3. This training is in addition to mandatory AF training (e.g., information assurance [IA]
   training).
2.4. Trainer Program
   2.4.1. The AOC weapons system is not similar to other weapons systems in that active duty
   personnel are normally assigned for only one tour. Therefore, the AOC WS does not have a
   formal program to develop and certify trainers for a career. AOC personnel selected to
   perform as trainers are considered by AOC leadership as highly proficient in division and
   team processes or a particular AOC WS application. They will complete local AOC trainer
   program requirements below and are not required to complete any formal USAF
   trainer/instructor program in order to be considered an AOC trainer.

   2.4.2. AOC crew position trainers must be approved by the AOC or ARC aligned unit
   commander or commander designated division/team chiefs, and must be CMR in their
   current AOC crew position.
Note: AOCs may elect to use a SME for certain elements of their training programs (e.g.,
theater/mission familiarization training, systems and applications, or designated processes).
SMEs will not fill the role of duty position trainer but rather augment training given by the
designated trainer.
   2.4.3. AOC crew position trainers will receive the following training from the unit TM:
       2.4.3.1. Unit training administrative practices to include filling out unit training
       documentation
       2.4.3.2. Trainer responsibilities
       2.4.3.3. Positional training techniques
       2.4.3.4. Briefing/Debriefing techniques
2.5. Training Documentation
   2.5.1. AOC crewmember documentation: Units must maintain a permanent training record
   in LMS which contains the following milestones: DAS, training start dates, IQT and MQT
   training dates, IQT graduation/completion date, MQT training completion date, CMR award
   date, N-CMR events, deployment dates and associated orientation training, and any other
   significant training dates. ARC aligned units will maintain their own records in LMS.
   2.5.2. Orientation documentation: The content of the orientation training provided must be
   documented.
   2.5.3. Annual Training Plan (ATP): All AOCs, and ARC aligned units, will develop an
   annual training plan which should include the following elements:
       2.5.3.1. AOC crewmember positions (those AFI 13-1AOC Vol 3 positions either manned
       or expected to be filled with a requirement to train).
       2.5.3.2. Unique AOC positions mapped against IQT options (FTU, ADL, or IUIQT).
       2.5.3.3. Additional CT training requirements (in addition to Attachment 3).
       2.5.3.4. Event or methodology used to accomplish training, i.e.          part task trainer,
       Exercise Key Resolve, etc.
       2.5.3.5. Mission execution, mission planning, or academic event from attachment 3 or
       MAJCOM requirements.
   2.5.4. Unit Training Documentation (Electronically in LMS)
       2.5.4.1. Position Training Form (Example ACC Form 206, AETC Form 186)
       2.5.4.2. Position 797/TTL
       2.5.4.3. AF Forms 4141 and 4142
       2.5.4.4. Any other unit, to include trainer training as well as MAJCOM directed training
       documentation.

                                  Chapter 3 (Added-AFSPC)

                            AOC PROCEDURES AND ORDERS

3.1. (Added-AFSPC) Technical Data.
   3.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) Operational systems and weapon systems will not be operated
   without validated and verified technical data or operations procedures. Once technical data or
   operational checklists are in place, crews will use these technical data/checklists at all times
   (or as specified in the technical data) when operating the systems. Use of Temporary
   Procedures (TPs) described in para. 3.2.3 will not be used for defense systems with formally
   published technical orders (TOs). TOs will be adhered to until revised in accordance with
   T.O. 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order System and all other applicable technical order
   directives.
3.2. (Added-AFSPC) Space Operations Procedures.
   3.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) This section outlines the basic process for development, validation,
   and approval of procedures based on new or changed operations requirements for
   units/defense systems without formally published technical data. These procedures can be
   permanent or temporary. Contractor-developed procedures are produced and delivered
   according to the specifications in the governing contract. The implementing unit must review
   these contractor documents for impact to unit procedures.
   3.2.2. (Added-AFSPC) Procedures Development and Validation:
      3.2.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) Validation. The organization(s) required to implement the
      procedure first validates it through trial use. Run the procedures, noting the expected
      outcome for each step or task. If the outcome is not as expected, then an analysis must be
      accomplished to determine any required modifications to the procedures or expected
      results. Provide recommendations to the developer for consideration or approval. If the
      trial run of a new procedure may impact operations or operational equipment, it must be
      conducted on an off-line simulator/system (if available) with sufficient fidelity to ensure
      no mission impact/equipment damage to the operational system.
      3.2.2.2. (Added-AFSPC) Permanent Procedures. These are necessary to ensure
      successful mission accomplishment. Although they are usually required for an indefinite
      period of time, they may be periodically modified to keep pace with changes to system or
      mission requirements. Permanent procedures are documented in positional checklists or
      operations manuals. Locally prepared checklists are formatted IAW T.O. 00-5-1,
      MILPRF-38314, Manuals, Technical: Operation and Associated Checklist (Space
      Systems), Preparation of, and MIL-STD-38784, Standard Practice for Manuals,
      Technical: General Style and Format Requirements.
      3.2.2.3. (Added-AFSPC) Changes. Changes to permanent procedures are categorized
      according to the urgency for their implementation. Modifications usually are affected
      through the replacement of whole pages. The three categories of changes are emergency,
      urgent, and routine.
          3.2.2.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) Emergency. These require immediate action on a
          deficiency that, if not corrected, would result in a fatality or serious injury to
AFI13-1AOCV1_AFSPCSUP_I 18 JANUARY 2013                                                    27


         personnel, extensive damage or destruction of equipment or property, or inability to
         achieve or maintain the mission.
         3.2.2.3.2. (Added-AFSPC) Urgent. These require action on a deficiency which, if
         not corrected, could cause one or more of the following: personnel injury; damage to
         equipment or property; reduce operational efficiency; or could jeopardize the safety
         or success of mission accomplishment.
         3.2.2.3.3. (Added-AFSPC) Routine. These require action on deficiencies that do not
         fall into the emergency or urgent categories. These are modifications to existing
         procedures that do not affect the overall process for completion, such as
         administrative changes.
     3.2.2.4. (Added-AFSPC) 614 AOC will develop procedures regarding the coordination
     and approval process for permanent procedures contained in positional checklists and
     operations manuals as well as checklist numbering schemes.
         3.2.2.4.1. (Added-AFSPC) The coordination process must address procedure
         technical accuracy assurance, standardization of procedures, safety concerns and
         training requirements.
         3.2.2.4.2. (Added-AFSPC) The approval process must identify the final approval
         authority for new or changed procedures. The final approval authority ensures the
         procedure satisfies the operational requirement, is technically accurate, is in
         compliance with DoD and Air Force directives or instructions, and is formatted
         appropriately.
     3.2.2.5. (Added-AFSPC) All permanent procedures are maintained in the appropriate
     work center or issued to all personnel performing duties in the work center. No new or
     changed procedures will be used for operations until properly coordinated, approved and
     trained to crew members. A unit may recommend to the approving authority that the
     procedure be categorized as a TP pending final approval. In this case, the procedure must
     meet all TP requirements before implementation.
     3.2.2.6. (Added-AFSPC) Individuals have the responsibility to take actions necessary
     to ensure the procedure in use is accurate. Work centers will review procedures at least
     annually to ensure accuracy, currency, and mission applicability.
     3.2.2.7. (Added-AFSPC) Forward a copy of all approved permanent procedures and
     related training material to the unit providing system initial qualification training, as
     applicable. 614 AOC will submit only approved permanent procedures that apply to
     AETC trained IQT courses.
  3.2.3. (Added-AFSPC) Temporary Procedures. TPs are used to temporarily alter existing
  permanent procedures for defense systems without formally published TOs. Posted directly
  opposite the affected procedure, they are usually required to be implemented because of a
  unique mission requirement (e.g., to support system testing or to support a system
  engineering analysis requirement). They are seldom modified; instead, they are regenerated
  as a new TP and the previous version rescinded. TPs may be used to affect partial changes to
  permanent procedures until the procedure or page may be replaced in its entirety IAW
  paragraph 3.2.2.3.
28                                    AFI13-1AOCV1_AFSPCSUP_I 18 JANUARY 2013


     3.2.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) Temporary Procedure Request (TPR) is the document used to
     implement a TP. Initially attached to the TP during the coordination process and prior to
     TP posting, the TPR includes the following information (at a minimum): posting and
     removal instructions, effective dates, issuing agency, and coordinating/approval agencies
     and signatures.
     3.2.3.2. (Added-AFSPC) There are three categories of TPs: emergency, urgent, and
     routine. See paragraphs 3.2.2.3.1. through 3.2.2.3.3. for definitions.
     3.2.3.3. (Added-AFSPC) 614 AOC will develop requirements regarding the approval,
     coordination, and control of TPs.
        3.2.3.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) At a minimum, the coordination process must ensure
        technical accuracy and training requirements, as required.
        3.2.3.3.2. (Added-AFSPC) All affected duty positions must be knowledgeable of
        and have access to a copy of the TPR and associated TP prior to performing duty in
        the weapon system or receipt of weapon system training.
     3.2.3.4. (Added-AFSPC) Units review open TPs for possible integration into permanent
     procedures. 14 AF or 614 AOC will develop requirements for reviewing TPs, to include
     schedule, responsible agency and revocation and extension authorities.
  3.2.4. (Added-AFSPC) Supplemental Procedures. Supplemental procedures are used to
  amplify/augment existing permanent procedures without altering them. 614 AOC will
  develop procedures regarding the coordination and approval process for supplemental
  procedures.
AFI13-1AOCV1_AFSPCSUP_I 18 JANUARY 2013                                                      29


                                 Chapter 4 (Added-AFSPC)

          PLANS, CERTIFICATIONS AND CREW FORCE MANAGEMENT

4.1. (Added-AFSPC) Operations Log.
   4.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) Units will log operational activities in a crew or duty log. This log
   will at a minimum include identification of on-duty personnel, major operational activities,
   significant communications, major system degradations and other abnormal system
   responses.
4.2. (Added-AFSPC) Operations Review Boards (ORB)
   4.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) Units will establish an ORB process to conduct an investigation to
   determine the cause of any abnormal system response. Examples of circumstances requiring
   an ORB include: major system degradation, indications of erroneous system
   response/procedures with significant mission impact, and significant events where the cause
   cannot be determined by initial assessment or when corrective action is beyond minimal
   retraining/minor procedural changes. Any unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences,
   that results in damage or injury and meets appropriate mishap reporting criteria requires a
   safety investigation and report as detailed in AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
   System is defined as hardware, software, ground segment, space segment and operators.
   4.2.2. (Added-AFSPC) The ORB convening authority is the 14 AF/A3 or the 614
   AOC/CC. ORB composition is at the discretion of the convening authority. Inform the 14
   AF/A3V, HQ AFRC/A3T, HQ AFSPC/A3T, 14 AF/SE and the division within HQ
   AFSPC/A3 responsible for the mission via message when an ORB is convened (electronic
   versions are acceptable).
   4.2.3. (Added-AFSPC) ORB minutes will be approved at the next organizational level
   above the convening authority. Send a copy of ORB minutes to the NAF, with information
   copies to HQ AFRC/A3T, HQ AFSPC/A3T, HQ AFSPC/SE and the division within HQ
   AFSPC/A3 responsible for the mission (electronic versions are acceptable). ORB minutes
   will not be released outside of AFSPC without prior approval from the HQ AFSPC/A3.
4.3. (Added-AFSPC) Initial Operations for New or Upgraded Systems.
   4.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) Prior to system operational test activities and/or initial operations,
   the wing/group ensures operations, training, standardization, evaluation and crew force
   management programs are developed and managed to provide adequate support to the new or
   upgraded system operations. The unit commander will report this status using Status of
   Resources and Training System (SORTS) criteria (see AFI10-201, Status of Resources and
   Training System).
      4.3.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) When significant hardware, software or procedural changes
      impact unit mission requirements, the certifying official will determine whether
      supplemental training or requalification is warranted. If supplemental training is needed,
      units will develop and conduct training prior to implementing changes. If requalification
      training is deemed necessary, units will train, evaluate and certify affected personnel
      prior to implementing changes.
30                                    AFI13-1AOCV1_AFSPCSUP_I 18 JANUARY 2013


  4.3.2. (Added-AFSPC) To prepare for significant equipment or procedural changes, a
  limited number of subject matter experts (SMEs) in the unit may be designated CMR
  certified by the certifying official. The primary duties of the SME is to develop technical
  documentation, training and evaluation materials, and to conduct training and evaluations.
     4.3.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) SME designation will be documented in individual training
     records.
     4.3.2.2. (Added-AFSPC) SMEs must accomplish the appropriate training for the duty
     position, such as contractor-provided Type 1 training, if available. If deemed more
     appropriate and cost effective, SME training may be accomplished by other training types
     defined in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program. Document completion of SME
     training in individual training records.
     4.3.2.3. (Added-AFSPC) SMEs will validate training/evaluation programs through
     formative and summative evaluation methods IAW ISD processes. This will include
     delivery of training and evaluation to non-SME personnel to validate program
     effectiveness and to ensure sufficient numbers of personnel are certified to support
     system test activities and initial operations.

Terms
Ancillary Training—Training that contributes to mission accomplishment, but is separate from
Air Force Specialty or occupational series training (further defined on the ETCA website,
https://etca.randolph.af.mil/default1.asp).   Ancillary training does not constitute AOC
training.
AOC Type—Refers to AOC categorization as either Geographic or Functional (see Geographic
and Functional AOC definitions). AOC training instructions applicable to all AOC types are
located in Chapter 1. AOC training instructions specific to Geographic AOCs are located in
Chapter 2. AOC training instructions for the Functional AOCs are located in subsequent
 38                                      AFI13-1AOCV1_AFSPCSUP_I 18 JANUARY 2013


chapters as outlined in the Table of Contents. While Chapter 1 is applicable to all AOCs,
subsequent chapters may be more restrictive but not less than Chapter 1. Note: the term "CAF"
AOCs refers to Geographic AOCs plus the 608th.
Augmentee—Personnel filling AOC positions on a temporary, short-term basis (i.e. TDY to
exercises or contingencies). Augmentees require tailored orientation training, and may require
positional training. Augmentee AOC training is the responsibility of the gaining AOC.
Basic Qualification (BQ)— An AOC crewmember who has completed IQT but not completed
MQT. They are able to perform basic AOC positional activities for which they have been
trained.
Certification—Designation of an AOC crewmember-trainee by the AOC/CC, as having
successfully completed MQT (including positional review, debrief, and any directed additional
training), and requisite mission qualification examination (MQE). Certification may result in
CMR status. Certification also applies to AOC crewmember upgrade to trainer.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)— The qualification status of an AOC crewmember who
successfully completes IQT and MQT training requirements, passes initial and mission
qualification testing (if applicable) and has been certified by the commander or designated
representative.
Currency— AFI does not mandate currency with respect to accomplishment of CT
requirements. There is no measure of time between required CT events (e.g. Push an ATO
every 45 days). Thus, if AOCs elect to impose currency requirements, they should be designed
to ensure the average crewmember maintains a minimum level of proficiency in a given duty or
task. Currency differs from CT periods and requirements per this AFI, in that currency refers to
periods of time linked directly to events (such as a pilot having to perform a landing within 30
days of his last accomplished landing). CT periods refer to timeframes during which a set
number of events must be accomplished.
Functional AOC— One of the two AOC Types, along with Geographic. Functional AOCs
have function-specific missions which are worldwide in scope, in support of a Functional
Combatant Command. They include 608th (Global Strike), 614th (Space), 618th (Mobility),
and 623rd (Special Ops).
Geographic AOC— One of the two AOC Types, along with Functional. Geographic AOCs
have broad-ranging missions which are constrained in scope to a geographic Area of
Responsibility, in support of a Geographic Unified (or Sub-unified) Combatant Command.
They include 601st, 603rd, 607th, 609th, 611th, 612th, 613th and 617th.
Liaison Officer (LNO)—Allied nation, sister service, other government agencies, or unique
major weapons system/mission representative working for their own respective commander but
providing planning/tasking expertise and coordination capability in support of the AOC. AOCs
will provide and document orientation training to LNOs to facilitate integration.
Non-Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR)— The qualification status of an individual who, having
achieved CMR status, regresses due to failure to accomplish mandatory CT requirements. See
respective AOC type chapter for consequence and repair of N-CMR status. See definition of
Unqualified for distinction from N-CMR.
AFI13-1AOCV1_AFSPCSUP_I 18 JANUARY 2013                                                       39


Requalification Training—Tailored training for formerly-CMR AOC crewmembers that have
become unqualified for any reason. Objective is return to CMR status. Completion will be
followed by positional re-evaluation and accomplishment of recurring qualification examination
(RQE). AOC TMs will coordinate with applicable division/team training personnel and if
necessary, Stan/Eval, to identify performance deficiencies and create appropriate requalification
training plans. Requalification training plans require AOC/CC approval.
Trainer—CMR AOC crewmember, authorized via AOC trainer upgrade program and AOC/CC
certification, to conduct AOC crewmember training. Trainers may also be contractors who were
previously qualified and hired for subject matter expertise. Further guidance in 2.4 of this AFI.
Training Task List (TTL)—Documentation of total training tasks developed for a prime
mission system and its respective mission. It includes the entire spectrum of tasks in each
functional area requiring training. The TTL provides the training task baseline for all
acquisition, modification, support, management, and funding actions through comparison with
predecessor or future prime mission systems (AFI 36-2251, Management of Air Force Training
Systems). MAJCOMs with their respective AOCs develop AOC TTLs. AOC Training TTLs
will be approved by HQ USAF/A3O. All CAF MQT TTLs for AFI 13-1AOCV3 listed duty
positions must be standardized through ACC/A3C. TTLs will be posted to the AOC CoP.
Type 1 Training—Contract training by civilian industrial institutions, supporting initial cadres
of trainers and operators the Air Force requires for new or modified AOC systems (often referred
to as "train the trainer").    The AOC TM will coordinate this training with AFMC/ESC,
specifically the SPO (ESC/HSGB).           Type 1 Training should be documented as such in
accordance with pertinent AOC Type chapter of this AFI.
Unqualified (UQ)—Previously CMR AOC crewmembers whose CMR status has lapsed due to
any of the following reasons: N-CMR in excess of six mos, PCS/PCA out of AOC crewmember
assignment, or AOC/CC-directed. See Requalification Training. Note, AOC crewmember-
trainees in IQT are not "unqualified," they are "not qualified.‖ In addition, those in MQT status
are not UQ rather BQ.
