                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This volume, in conjunction with AFI 11-202V2, provides both flight examiners
and aircrew members with procedures and evaluation criteria that will be used during flight
evaluations. It is a reference document and a standard for training and operational purposes.
Adherence to these procedures and criteria will ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency
and capabilities of aircrew members.
1.2. Waivers. Waiver authority for this publication is the MAJCOM/A3, IAW AFI 11-202 Vol
2. Waivers will be requested from the parent MAJCOM Stan/Eval through appropriate channels.
Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the supplement and approved
through the higher level coordination authority.
1.3. Procedures.
   1.3.1. Aircrew Flight Evaluation Procedures.
       1.3.1.1. Prior to Flight. The Stan/Eval Flight Examiner (SEFE) will explain the purpose
       of the flight and how it will be conducted. The examinee will accomplish all mission
       planning appropriate for the type of evaluation.
       1.3.1.2. During Flight. The SEFE will evaluate the examinee's performance for each
       graded area and note discrepancies when deviations from prescribed performance criteria
       occur during the flight evaluation.
       1.3.1.3. Post Flight. The SEFE will compare the examinee's performance with the
       grading criteria and will assign an appropriate grade for each area. The SEFE will
       consider cumulative momentary deviations. If flight manuals/instructions/publications
       recommend a specific range for performance, the SEFE will apply the grading criteria to
       the upper and lower limits of that range. The judgment of the SEFE will be the
       determining factor in assigning an overall grade for the examinee's performance. The
       SEFE will thoroughly critique all aspects of the evaluation. During this critique, the
       SEFE will review the examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned,
       and any additional training which the examinee will be required to complete. All initial
       qualification or initial instructor evaluations resulting in EQ, Q2, or Q3 will be debriefed
       with the examinee's squadron commander/operations officer (or designated
       representative), flight commander (or designated representative), and a representative
       from the gaining squadron.
   1.3.1. 4 The Flight examiner should not occupy a primary crew position during evaluations,
   but may do so if conditions warrant.
       1.3.1.5. Pilots unqualified in the crew position in which they are being evaluated will
       have a qualified IP/SEFE in the other pilot position during engine start, taxi, takeoffs, air
       refueling, instrument approaches, and landings. The SEFE will disregard minor
       deviations from tolerances for the purpose of clearing conflicting traffic provided the
       examinee initiates timely corrective action. When VMC, see and avoid responsibilities
       are paramount.
 6                                                          AFI11-2E-3V2 23 FEBRUARY 2012


     1.3.2. Acceptance of evaluations from outside parent MAJCOM.
        1.3.2.1. Evaluations from North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are not valid and
        require a current US E-3 evaluation with accompanying AF Form 8, Certificate of
        Aircrew Qualification, IAW AFI 11-202V2 and current MAJCOM supplement. Prior to
        evaluation, NATO returnees must accomplish applicable difference training IAW AFI
        11-2E-3V1, E-3 Aircrew Training.
        1.3.2.2. Evaluations will be accepted between ACC, AFRC and PACAF E-3s.
        1.3.2.3. Evaluations from Royal Saudi Air Force will not be accepted.
     1.3.3. Administering evaluations outside MAJCOM. Unit flight examiners may give
     evaluations outside of their organization, to include administering evaluations outside of their
     MAJCOM. If administering evaluations outside of the flight examiner’s MAJCOM, the
     evaluation will be specifically requested by the MAJCOM stan/eval organization of the
     examinee and approved by the MAJCOM stan/eval organization of the examiner IAW AFI
     11-202V2.
     1.3.4. SEFE Objectivity Evaluations will be accomplished at the discretion of the applicable
     OG/CC to ensure standardization among evaluators. SEFE Objectivity evaluations will be
     documented as "SPOT" evaluations in the Mission/Check block of the Flight Phase of the AF
     Form 8 with further description added in the Mission Description section of the Comments
     block.
1.4. Grading Policies:
     1.4.1. Standardization/Evaluation Flight Examiners (SEFEs) will use the grading policies
     contained in AFI 11-202V2, and the evaluation criteria in this instruction for conducting all
     E-3 AWACS aircrew flight evaluations. Use of these criteria will ensure standard and
     objective evaluations are administered to aircrew members. SEFEs and crewmembers will
     be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed grading criteria in this regulation. A three-level
     grading system (Q, Q-, or U) will be used for all areas except those designated as
     CRITICAL, in which case a two-grading system (Q or U) will be used.
     1.4.2. Critical Grading Areas. Critical grading areas have been established for aircrew flight
     evaluations. Critical areas are defined as events that require adequate accomplishment by the
     examinee in order to successfully achieve the mission objectives and complete the
     evaluation. If an examinee receives a "U" grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the
     evaluation will also be unqualified. Critical areas are identified by "(CRITICAL)" following
     the applicable area title.
AFI11-2E-3V2 23 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                       7


                                            Chapter 2

                              EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2. Evaluation
requirements are depicted in each crew position's evaluation criteria section.
   2.1.1. Required Evaluation Areas. The SEFE will evaluate the examinee's performance in
   all required areas annotated with an ―R‖. Schedule all required areas on the same sortie
   when possible. When a required area cannot be evaluated in-flight because of equipment
   malfunctions, weather conditions, operational requirements, or lack of adequate operating
   airspace, the area may be graded using simulation or a verbal evaluation. SEFEs will make
   every effort to evaluate all required areas during the flight before resorting to this alternative.
   If this alternative is used, an explanation will be included in the appropriate section on the
   back of the AF Form 8. This explanation will identify which areas/parts of areas were not
   evaluated in-flight.
2.2. Ground Phase Requisites. The following qualification (QUAL) evaluation requisites are
common to all crew positions and will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-202V2 and unit directives.
The examinee must satisfy all ground phase requisites within their eligibility period to complete
recurring evaluations or within six months of initial QUAL evaluations. These requisites (with
the exception of the publications check) will be recorded under the Ground Phase area, Section II
of the AF Form 8. Table 2.1 list requisites that must be completed by evaluation type.
   2.2.1. Closed Book Requisite Exam. Closed book questions will come from Master
   Question File (MQFs)/ Local Operating Procedures (LOP). These questions will emphasize
   system knowledge and information necessary for safe flight and mission accomplishment.
   CSOs and/or CTs will only test in the position for which they are qualified. Dual qualified
   CSOs/CTs and those completing CET will test on both the CSO and CT positions.
   2.2.2. Bold Face (Pilots only). This exam must consist of one question concerning each
   critical action emergency procedure applicable to the individual's specialty. The answer must
   contain all critical action items in proper sequence. Verbatim responses are required.
   2.2.3. Open Book Requisite Exam. Open book questions will come from publications
   containing information pertinent to the operation of the aircraft and performance of the
   assigned mission. The open book subject areas and the publications used to generate the
   exam will be made available to aircrew. Units may use a secure question bank (SQB) as the
   source for some or all of the open book examination questions. Note: Open and closed book
   test requirements will be based on the qualification level of the examinee. CSOs and/or CTs
   will only test in the position for which they are qualified. Dual qualified CSOs/CTs and
   those completing CET will test on both the CSO and CT positions.
   2.2.4. Publications Check. A thorough publications check will be accomplished on all
   publications required for the mission. Publications are identified IAW local OGV directives.
   2.2.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). Reference AFI 11-202V2, an EPE is
   required for all aircrew members within the eligibility period for required flight evaluations.

1 = IAW AFI 11-202V2, a single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
QUAL eval) as long as the combined EPE is of a scope and duration to cover required areas and
is conducted within the requisite zone for each evaluation.
2.3. Flight Simulator Evaluation Procedures. For pilots and flight engineers, the EPE will be
conducted in the Operational Flight Trainer (OFT). For pilots only, the instrument/qualification
evaluation may also be conducted in the OFT. Normally, the EPE will be conducted separately
from the INSTM/QUAL simulator, but may be combined as desired. All evaluations will be
conducted IAW the criteria in Chapter 3, and will be administered by a SEFE. Units will
outline local procedures/profiles to accomplish all simulator evaluation requirements below.
     2.3.1. Emergency Procedure Evaluation (EPE – pilots and flight engineer). During the EPE,
     the following requirements will be accomplished .             Units will develop local
     procedures/profiles to accomplish these requirements.
        2.3.1.1. Unusual attitudes.
        2.3.1.2. Initial buffet/stick shaker recovery.
        2.3.1.3. Low visibility approach and landing (grade under Precision Approach and
        Landing).
        2.3.1.4. Systems operation, normal/emergency (minimum of eight systems).
        2.3.1.5. Three-engine-Rudder Boost Out (RBO) or two-engine approach, to a landing or
        go-around (FP/AC/IP only)
AFI11-2E-3V2 23 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    9


   2.3.2. When a simulator is not available, the EPE may be conducted in a cockpit procedural
   trainer, or through verbal discussion on the ground.
2.4. Mission Evaluation:
   2.4.1. Mission Profiles. Mission profiles will accomplish the following: reflect unit daily
   training mission and unit tasking, provide realistic assessment of examinee capabilities, and
   provide assessment of the application of current tactics. Evaluation profile sorties will be
   defined by the unit and will include a scenario, and other pertinent information that would
   normally be available in theater (Air Tasking Order (ATO), Airspace Control Order (ACO),
   Operational Tasking Data Links (OPTASKLINK), intelligence data such as air and ground
   order of battle, political assessment, etc.). Qualification and mission evaluations may be
   combined into a single evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2.
   2.4.2. Evaluations will be accomplished on mission/combat training sorties, or theater sorties
   (if deployed, with Detachment Commander (DETCO) approval and a back-up plan in case of
   evaluation failure) to the maximum extent possible. The examinee will demonstrate
   knowledge and abilities in all required areas on E-3 specified mission profiles IAW Chapter
   3 of this instruction. If all required areas cannot be evaluated on a single sortie, remaining
   areas will be evaluated in the simulator, on a subsequent sortie, or with verbal evaluation in a
   ground evaluation scenario.
       2.4.2.1. Mission Simulator Evaluation Procedures. The mission simulators or sim-over-
       live in-flight may be used to administer any portion of a flight evaluation not requiring a
       specific live scenario. Simulation may be used to complete flight evaluations,
       accomplish additional training, or conduct reevaluations. The SEFE's judgment will be
       the determining factor in the effective use of simulation.
   2.4.3. IAW AFI 11-202V2, the mission evaluation is waived for the following E-3 positions:
   Pilots, Flight Engineer, Navigator, Communications System Operator, Communications
   Technician, Computer Display Maintenance Technician, Airborne Radar Technician, and
   Battle Director Technician.
       2.4.3.1. Combat Mission Ready (CMR) and Basic Mission Capable (BMC) aircrew
       waived from mission evaluation will be verbally evaluated on E-3 Self-Defense
       procedures under their respective Areas for Emergency Procedures and Equipment
       criteria. CMR pilots will be verbally evaluated on E-3 Self-Defense procedures under
       Area 29 - Systems Operations (Normal/Emergency).
2.5. Instructor Evaluation. All flying personnel selected for instructor duty must be evaluated
to determine their judgment, technical knowledge, instructor ability (including error analysis of
student activity), and use of grading documents as well as proficiency in their aircrew specialty.
To initially qualify as an instructor, a crewmember must successfully complete an initial
instructor evaluation. Initial instructor evaluations may be conducted in conjunction with the
examinee's periodic qualification evaluation and should be accomplished on actual instructional
missions whenever possible. Periodic evaluation of the ability of aircrew members to instruct
will be conducted during all subsequent periodic evaluations.
   2.5.1. Instructors must demonstrate proficiency by instructing a student (or qualified
   individual acting as a student). The examiner may require the examinee to present verbal

  explanations of equipment operations, procedures, and techniques pertinent to their crew
  position duties and responsibilities.
  2.5.2. Instructor Qualified Pilot Evaluations. In addition to all pilot qualification/instrument
  requirements in this instruction, instructor pilot evaluations will include the following:
     2.5.2.1. Air refueling envelope demonstration (accomplish in-flight).
     2.5.2.2. Touch and go landing (as pilot flying or not flying).
     2.5.2.3. Abnormal flap landing or landing attitude demonstration.
     2.5.2.4. Aircraft.
         2.5.2.4.1. Initial instructor evaluations will be administered with the examinee in the
         copilot position. An IP/SEFE will be in the pilot position for those maneuvers that
         require IP/SEFE supervision.
         2.5.2.4.2. Recurring evaluations may be administered with a student, pilot, first pilot,
         copilot, IP, or SEFE occupying the other pilot position. The examinee may occupy
         either the pilot or copilot position on recurring evaluations unless a specific position
         is desired by the SEFE. The SEFE will particularly note the instructor's ability to
         recognize student difficulties and provide effective, timely corrective action.
         Recurring evaluations will be administered in conjunction with required qualification
         flight evaluations and will include all areas using both qualification and instructor
         criteria.
     2.5.2.5. Simulator.
         2.5.2.5.1. Initial Instructor evaluations will include all areas on pilot evaluations
         IAW para 3.2.1.3. The examinee will be required to accomplish a takeoff, precision
         approach, and touch-and-go landing from the copilot position.
         2.5.2.5.2. Recurring evaluations the examinee may occupy either pilot or copilot
         position unless a specific position is desired by the SEFE. The SEFE will particularly
         note the instructor's ability to recognize student difficulties and provide effective,
         timely corrective action. Recurring evaluations will be administered in conjunction
         with required qualification flight evaluations and will include all areas using both
         qualification and instructor criteria.
  2.5.3. Other Aircrew Instructor Flight Evaluations. Instructor flight evaluations will be
  conducted with a student occupying the applicable aircrew position whenever possible. The
  student will perform those duties prescribed by the instructor for the mission being
  accomplished. The instructor examinee will monitor all phases of flight from an
  advantageous position and be prepared to demonstrate or explain any area or procedure. The
  SEFE will particularly note the instructor's ability to recognize student difficulties and
  provide effective, timely corrective action. Recurring evaluations will be administered in
  conjunction with required qualification flight evaluations and will include all areas using
  both qualification and instructor criteria.
     2.5.3.1. During qualification evaluations of qualified instructors, the examinee must
     assume the seat position for a period of time of sufficient length to demonstrate
     proficiency in the crew position. The determination of what represents a sufficient length
AFI11-2E-3V2 23 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                 11


     of time is left to the judgment of the SEFE. The portion of the mission during which the
     examinee will occupy the seat position can be determined by the SEFE during mission
     planning or during the course of the mission.

                              FLIGHT CREW EVALUATIONS

3.1. General. This chapter contains the task oriented criteria for all evaluations IAW AFI 11-
202V2 and AFI 11-401, Aviation Management. Evaluation requirements are outlined in matrices
for Instructor Pilot/Pilot/First Pilot/Copilot (IP/P/FP/CP), Navigator (N), and Flight Engineer
(FE).
3.2. Instructor Pilot/Pilot/First Pilot/Copilot Qualification and Instrument Flight
Evaluations
   3.2.1. General. This section contains the task-oriented criteria for qualification and
   instrument evaluations of Instructor Pilot (IP), Pilot (P), First Pilot (FP), and Copilot (CP), to
   include instrument/qualification flight evaluations.
       3.2.1.1. Instrument/qualification (INSTM/QUAL) evaluations will encompass all areas
       identified in the evaluation matrix except as noted below. The examinee must
       demonstrate a degree of knowledge and proficiency essential for successful mission
       accomplishment and safety of flight.
          3.2.1.1.1. First pilots and copilots may accomplish an air refueling spot evaluation
          (Area 16, Air Refueling), to become air refueling qualified. Once qualified, all
          subsequent instrument/qualification evaluations will require full evaluation of Area
          16.
          3.2.1.1.2. For Initial Qualification Training FP candidates, initial air refueling
          qualification (Area 16, Air Refueling) will be deferred. FP candidates who
          successfully demonstrate proficiency in AAR may accomplish the initial air refueling
          qualification as part of their flight evaluation at the discretion of the 966 AACS/CC.
          When the initial air refueling qualification is deferred, FPs must successfully
          accomplish the initial air refueling qualification no later than their next
          instrument/qualification evaluation.
          3.2.1.1.3. Copilots will not be evaluated in Area 25, Simulated Engine(s) Out
          Pattern/Landing or Area 26, Simulate Engine(s) Out Go-Around.
       3.2.1.2. Instrument/qualification evaluations may be conducted on either pilot
       proficiency sorties (P-sortie) or mission sorties (combat training sorties, surveillance
       sorties, etc.). If conducted on a sortie where Area 11, On-Station Procedures, is not
       performed, this area will be verbally evaluated.
       3.2.1.3. Use of Flight Crew OFT for Flight Phase portions of the Evaluation.
          3.2.1.3.1. Flight Phase areas evaluated under standard EPE profile. Area 17, Holding
          is normally accomplished only in the OFT due to time/mission constraints and will be
          graded as part of the EPE unless seen on a live sortie or in an OFT sortie separate
          from the EPE. If there is a discrepancy in any of these areas during the EPE, it will
          be documented in the AF Form 8 in Section IV, paragraph B (Discrepancies), under
          ―Ground Phase.‖
AFI11-2E-3V2 23 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               15


         3.2.1.3.2. Except for areas listed in paragraph 3.2.1.3.3 of this instruction, Flight
         Phase areas may be evaluated in the OFT IAW AFI 11-202 V2. Areas evaluated in
         the OFT to finish an incomplete aircraft evaluation, will be documented in Section II
         of the AF Form 8 under Flight Phase as a ―SIM-INSTM/QUAL‖. In Section IV, the
         mission description will be documented as ―Second Sortie (ATD)‖.
         3.2.1.3.3. For initial/re-qualification evaluations, the following areas will be
         evaluated during a live sortie: Area 7, Takeoff; Area 16, Air Refueling; Area 23,

                                WEAPONS EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. This chapter contains the task oriented criteria for all evaluations IAW AFI 11-
202V2 and AFI 11-401. Evaluation requirements are outlined in Senior Director (SD) and Air
Weapons Officer (AWO) position matrices.
   5.1.1. Qualification and mission evaluations encompass all areas identified in the evaluation
   matrix. The examinee must demonstrate a degree of knowledge and proficiency essential for
   successful mission accomplishment, profile execution, and safety of flight.
   5.1.2. SD qualification evaluations will be conducted on a live E-3 sortie while the examinee
   actively supervises a weapons team conducting weapons control activity. Acceptability of
   required activity will be based on the evaluator’s determination that the evaluation objective
   has been met. The evaluation will include assessing the examinee’s ability to successfully
   accomplish appropriate areas in paragraph 5.3 and control a live mission.
   5.1.3. SD mission evaluations will be conducted on a live E-3 sortie whenever possible. The
   examinee will actively supervise a weapons team conducting weapons control activity during
   a Tactical or Air Sovereignty scenario. If unable to accomplish a mission evaluation on a
   live sortie, the mission evaluation may be accomplished in the simulator. Activity must
   demonstrate prosecution of the air battle through the execution of operations orders
   (OPORDs)/operations plans (OPLANs)/Special Instructions (SPINs) IAW applicable
   directives with sufficiency to effectively manage the mission/battle through fighter flow,
   tanker management, communications (external agency coordination and control), and
   applicable data link coordination. 5.1.4. There will be instances where an examinee, during a
   mission evaluation, accomplishes all areas required for a qualification evaluation. In this
   case, the evaluation will be annotated as a mission/qualification evaluation. Acceptability of
   required activity will be based on the evaluator's determination that all areas required for a
   mission and a qualification evaluation have been met. Due to the qualification evaluation
   criteria, this will require a live E-3 sortie. The evaluation will include assessing the
   examinee's ability to successfully accomplish Areas in paragraph 5.3.
   5.1.5. ISD evaluations will assess the examinee’s ability to instruct a student according to
   the criteria in Areas 31-33 in Paragraph 5.3.29. Initial ISD evaluations require an IQT/MQT
   SD student whenever possible. Initial ISD evaluations may include SD criteria for the
   purpose of updating expiration dates. ISD qualification evaluations conducted in conjunction
   with an SD evaluation will include appropriate areas in paragraph 5.3. During subsequent
   mission evaluations updating SD and ISD requirements together, the ISD will, by performing
   instructor duties, automatically update SD mission evaluation requirements. If the ISD
   instructs during a qualification evaluation, they still have the requirement to instruct or
   perform SD duties during a mission evaluation. As a minimum, the ISD will control to a
   qualification evaluation level.
   5.1.6. Completion of the ISD evaluation, which includes demonstration of competence as an
   AWO, qualifies the ISD to perform as an IAWO or AWO.              Completion of the SD
   evaluation, which includes demonstration of competence as an AWO, qualifies the SD to
   perform as an AWO. Completion of an SD or ISD evaluation, which includes demonstration
AFI11-2E-3V2 23 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                 61


   of competence as an AWO, qualifies the SD to perform as an AWO and the ISD to perform
   as an AWO or IAWO. An EAWO may evaluate an ISD and SD during the Demonstration-
   of-competence-as-an-AWO portion of the eval, but the examinee may not perform SD/ISD
   duties while being evaluated. An ESD may accomplish evaluations on both the SD and
   AWO positions.
   5.1.7. SDs that were previously qualified as IAWOs may continue to perform IAWO duties
   under the following conditions:
       5.1.7.1. The SD must perform IAWO duties on the SD INIT QUAL evaluation and
       subsequent recurring SD evaluations IAW paragraph 5.4.1.5.
       5.1.7.2. AF Form 8must include the restriction that reads as follows: ―RESTRICTION:
       Examinee may only instruct AWO crewmembers.‖
       5.1.7.3. Training certification forms must include a restriction allowing the SD to
       instruct AWO crewmembers only. An individual qualified as evaluator SD may
       accomplish evaluations on SD’s and AWOs.
5.2. Senior Director Evaluation Objectives:
   5.2.1. Qualification Evaluation. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to accomplish
   all required duties safely and effectively, using appropriate flight manuals, directives, and
   operating procedures.
   5.2.2. Mission Evaluation. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to accomplish all
   required duties safely and effectively, using appropriate flight manuals, directives, and
   operating procedures to ensure successful employment and mission accomplishment IAW the
   evaluation matrix.
   5.2.3. Ground Phase Requisites. The ground phase requisites are listed in paragraph 2.2.

      Air-to-Air, OCA Strike, defensive counter-air (DCA), Close Air Support (CAS), Time-
      Sensitive Targeting (TST), or the Air Refueling Controller during a mission profile.. If
      unable to accomplish a mission evaluation on a live sortie, the mission evaluation can be
      accomplished in the simulator. When an OCA, OCA Strike, or DCA profile is utilized,
      AWOs must control against a minimum of three adversary aircraft utilizing a full combat
      scenario. Evaluation profile sorties will be defined by the unit and will include mission
      characteristics defined in para 2.4.1 of this AFI. Activity must demonstrate prosecution
      of the air battle through the execution of operations orders (OPORDs)/operations plans
      (OPLANs)/Special Instructions (SPINs) IAW applicable directives with sufficiency to
      effectively manage the mission/battle through fighter flow, tanker management,
      communications, and applicable data link coordination.
      5.4.1.4. There will be instances where an examinee, during the flight, accomplishes all
      areas required for both the qualification evaluation and the mission evaluation. In this
      case, the evaluation will be annotated as a QUAL/MSN evaluation. Acceptability of
      required activity will be based on the evaluator's determination that all areas required for
      a mission and a qualification evaluation have been met. Due to the qualification
      evaluation criteria, this will require a live E-3 Sortie. The evaluation will include
      assessing the examinee's ability to successfully accomplish appropriate areas.
      5.4.1.5. IAWO evaluations will assess the examinee’s ability to instruct a student
      according to the criteria in Areas 34-36 in paragraph 5.6 Initial IAWO evaluations
      require an IQT/MQT AWO student whenever possible. Initial IAWO evaluations may
      include AWO criteria for the purpose of updating expiration dates. IAWO qualification
      evaluations conducted in conjunction with an AWO evaluation will include appropriate
      areas in paragraph 5.6 During subsequent evaluations updating AWO and IAWO
      requirements together, the IAWO will perform instructor duties as a minimum. If the
      IAWO instructs during a qualification evaluation, the IAWO still has the requirement to
      perform AWO duties during a mission evaluation.
      5.4.1.6. E-3 AWOs/IAWOs will be evaluated on live missions assigned by the Senior
      Director (SD). However, the evaluator is responsible for determining whether or not
      briefed/conducted control activities fulfill live control requirements. The specific control
      events not evaluated on a mission evaluation can be evaluated by simulation.
      5.4.1.7. EAWOs can evaluate AWOs and IAWOs.

                            SURVEILLANCE EVALUATIONS

6.1. General. This chapter contains the task oriented criteria for all evaluations IAW AFI 11-
202V2 and AFI 11-401. Evaluation requirements are outlined in matrices for Air Surveillance
Officer (ASO), Senior Surveillance Technician (SST), and Air Surveillance Technician (AST).
   6.1.1. Qualification evaluations will encompass all areas identified in the evaluation matrix.
   The examinee must demonstrate a degree of knowledge and proficiency essential for
   successful mission accomplishment and safety of flight.
   6.1.2. Mission evaluations will encompass all areas identified in the evaluation matrix for
   the mission profile performed. The examinee must demonstrate a degree of knowledge and
   proficiency essential for successful mission accomplishment, profile execution, and safety of
   flight.
   6.1.3. An individual qualified as evaluator ASO may accomplish evaluations for the ASO,
   SST, and AST crew positions.
6.2. Air Surveillance Officer (ASO) Qualification Flight Evaluations:
   6.2.1. General. This section contains the task-oriented criteria for qualification and mission
   evaluations of Instructor ASO and ASO.
       6.2.1.1. ASO qualification evaluations will be conducted on live E-3 sorties while the
       examinee actively supervises a surveillance team, conducting surveillance activities.
       ASO mission evaluations may be accomplished in the simulator, if a live mission profile
       sortie is unavailable.
   6.2.2. Evaluation Objectives:
       6.2.2.1. Qualification Evaluation. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to
       accomplish all required duties safely and effectively, using appropriate flight manuals,
       directives, and operating procedures.
       6.2.2.2. Mission Evaluation. Examinee must demonstrate the ability to accomplish all
       required duties safely and effectively, using appropriate flight manuals, directives, and
       operating procedures, ensuring successful employment and mission accomplishment of

                       AIRBORNE TECHNICIAN EVALUATIONS

9.1. General. This chapter contains the task oriented criteria for all evaluations IAW AFI 11-
202V2, and AFI 11-401. Evaluation requirements are outlined in matrices for Communications
Systems Operator (CSO), Communications Technician (CT), Computer Display Maintenance
Technician (CDMT), Airborne Radar Technician (ART).
   9.1.1. Qualification evaluations will encompass all areas identified in the evaluation matrix.
   The examinee must demonstrate a degree of knowledge and proficiency essential for
   successful mission accomplishment and safety of flight.
9.2. Airborne Communications Specialist Qualification Flight Evaluations:
   9.2.1. General. This section contains the task-oriented criteria for qualification evaluations
   of an Airborne Communications Specialist (ACS) performing duties as the CSO, Instructor
   Communications Systems Operator (ICSO), CT, and Instructor Communications Technician
   (ICT).
       9.2.1.1. Qualification evaluations will encompass all areas identified in the evaluation
       matrix for the position performed. The examinee must demonstrate a degree of
       knowledge and proficiency as described in the positional task listing essential for
       successful mission accomplishment and safety of flight. Examinee must demonstrate the
       ability to operate, manage and maintain all equipment associated with the position
       performed. Evaluations will be performed upon the completion of initial qualification
       training, career enhancement training (CET), instructor upgrade training and recurring
       evaluations. Crewmembers completing CET will receive an evaluation in the CSO
       position and an evaluation in the CT position making them dual qualified. Dual qualified
       crewmembers will receive recurring evaluations in both the CSO and CT position.
       Aircraft configuration may dictate that additional systems be evaluated if the examinee
       has been trained and certified in those systems. CSO/CT qualification evaluations will be
       conducted on a live E-3 sortie.
   9.2.2. Evaluation Objectives:
       9.2.2.1. Qualification Evaluation. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to
       accomplish all required duties safely and effectively, using appropriate flight manuals,
       directives, FLIP and operating procedures to ensure successful employment and mission
       accomplishment IAW the evaluation matrix in the CSO or CT position. If a dual qualified
       examinee performs a task of the opposite position, the examinee must demonstrate the
       ability to safely and effectively accomplish that task.
   9.2.3. Ground Phase Requisites. The ground phase requisites are listed in paragraph 2.2.
