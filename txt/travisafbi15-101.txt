                                           Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. The 60th Operations Support Squadron (60 OSS) Weather Flight (WF) provides
   and/or arranges for weather support to the 60th Air Mobility Wing and all tenant units
   assigned to Travis Air Force Base (TAFB) including the 15th Expeditionary Mobility Task
   Force, 615th Contingency Response Wing (CRW) and 349th Air Mobility Wing (Reserve).
   The WF is the focal point for all weather-related issues. This instruction establishes
   requirements and procedures pertaining to weather support during peacetime operations.
   This instruction will be reviewed annually and updated as required.
1.2. Background.
   1.2.1. IAW AFI 15-128, Air and Space Operations-Roles and Responsibilities, an
   Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) will provide resource protection, terminal aerodrome
   forecasts, regional, and operational-level weather products and information, meteorological
   watch (METWATCH), Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV), and flight weather briefing support
   for Air Force locations within designated geographic regions.
   1.2.2. The 25th OWS at Davis-Monthan AFB AZ provides regional and operational-level
   weather products and information to Air Force and Army units in the Western region of the
   Continental United States (CONUS).
   1.2.3. AFI 15-128 requires the Weather Flight (WF) at each Air Force base to focus its
   efforts on providing tactical-level weather products and information needed for mission
   execution and to provide weather products and information to the commander of deployed
   forces during wartime, contingency, and exercise operations.
1.3. Organization. WF functions and duty responsibilities are aligned under Mission Services,
Airfield Services, Staff Services, and Deployment Functions. Airfield and Mission Services
positions are performed simultaneously by a single forecaster in conjunction with duty priorities
and operating hours. Staff Services is provided by WF leadership or administrative positions.
Deployment functions is the capability for WF personnel to operate IAW the Designed
Operational Capabilities statement.
1.4. Responsibilities.
   1.4.1. General responsibilities of the OWSs and WFs are outlined in AFI 15128. Specific
   responsibilities of the 25 OWS and the Travis WF are defined in a Memorandum of
   Agreement between the 60 OSS and 25 OWS and in this instruction. The 25 OWS issues the
   TAFB Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs), forecasted weather warnings and watches,
   and provides flight weather briefings to transient aircrews passing through Travis that cannot
   be supported by the WF. The WF creates tailored weather products focused on local mission
   requirements, provides eyes forward weather observations, and issues all observed advisories
   and warnings. If the WF is unmanned, the 25 OWS will issue observed advisories.
   Additionally, the WF supports the base by educating members of TAFB agencies on the
 8                                                        TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011


     purpose and applicability of weather products as required by governing regulations or
     instructions and at the direction of the 60 AMW/CC.
1.5. Duty Priorities.
     1.5.1. 25 OWS Duty Priorities.
        1.5.1.1. The duty priorities listed in Tables 1.1 and 1.2 are used by 25 OWS personnel
        to match and balance limited capability based on manning and other restrictions against
        the many operational demands of its customers. These published duty priorities allow 25
        OWS personnel to focus their efforts during peak work periods on the requirements with
        the highest priority. 25 OWS personnel are allowed to modify these priorities by
        applying good judgment, experience and understanding of operational requirements to
        ensure more important tasks are accomplished first. This is especially true when there is
        imminent danger to life and/or property.

        1.5.1.2. In the unlikely event the entire WF must deploy, the 25 OWS will assume in-
        garrison support (which may include tactical-level MEFs) as agreed upon in the OWS-
        WF coordination prior to deployment. All in-garrison support provided by the 25 OWS
        will be prioritized based on the duty priorities described in Table 1.1
     1.5.2. WF Duty Priorities. WF duty priorities are listed in Table 1.3. WF personnel will use
     good judgment in complying with these duty priorities, especially when there is imminent
     danger to life and/or property.

12                      Conduct mission essential training
13                      Administrative duties and base details

1.6. Operational Hours. Weather observations and forecasts are provided to customers based
on operational needs. Normal operating hours are 0600-1800L, Monday-Friday excluding
holidays and 60 AMW down days. Considering weather Operational Risk Management (ORM),
operational mission support, forecast and current conditions, WF personnel will operate around
the clock as required. See Chapter 3 for specific Airfield Services and Chapter 4 for specific
Mission Services functions and operating requirements. Staff Services support, listed in
Chapter 5, is available during normal duty hours or as required for mission support (e.g.,
contingencies, exercises, etc). Non-contingency support will require advance coordination with
WF NCOIC or Flight Chief.
1.7. Assumptions, Shortfalls, and Limitations.
     1.7.1. 25 OWS Assumptions. Adequate resources and communications will be available to
     execute the requirements outlined in Memorandum of Agreement (MOA 15-17) and
     sufficient weather data/information will be available from various sources to produce reliable
     weather products.
 10                                                       TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011


   1.7.2. WF Assumptions. Weather support can only be provided if the appropriate facilities,
   funding, communications, personnel, and indigenous support (e.g., power, water, etc) are
   available.
   1.7.3. WF Shortfalls. Some services may not always be available (e.g., out of station
   briefings) due to WF staffing, station evacuation, or other higher priority missions.
   1.7.4. WF Limitations.
       1.7.4.1. Observing limitations. Visual obstructions will impact the accuracy of manually
       determined prevailing visibilities used in observations taken from building P-4 during
       supplement or back-up of the Automated Meteorological System (AMS). Reference
       Chapter 3 for detailed AMS procedures. These obstructions include buildings, hangars,
       parked aircraft, light towers, and trees and prevent forecasters from seeing the entire
       aerodrome. These obstructions especially restrict observing portions of the horizon from

       surface observations when required as identified in Chapter 12 of this instruction.
       1.7.4.2. Lightning and thunder. In back-up mode of AMS operations, lightning may not
       be seen due to distance, low clouds, or poor visibility. Thunder may not be heard
       because of flight-line noise.
1.8. Alternate (Back-up) Operating Location (AOL). In the event of a building evacuation,
all weather services will move to the 60 CES Flightline Fire Station, Building 895. The WF will
continue operational support for 60 AMW and other Travis units and its ―eyes forward‖
responsibilities to the 25 OWS. During evacuation, access to observing sensing equipment
readouts may be lost and back-up equipment may be used if available. If back-up mode
observations are required, ATC Tower personnel will back-up surface visibility readings for
observations as needed. WF members will follow duty specific SOPs and Evacuation Checklists
and provide weather services at the alternate location as soon as possible. To the maximum
extent possible all services and support functions will be provided or arranged for, but some
delays may occur due to the use of back-up systems. If the AOL activation is long term (greater
than 24 hours), a NOTAM will be issued through Airfield Management. For flight safety
reasons, the WF will maintain operations in the primary location as well as the AOL during
exercises, with the primary location taking precedence during manning shortages. See Chapter
11 for other back-up procedures. The WF will exercise and document evacuation procedures
semi-annually.
1.9. Release of Weather Information to Non-DoD Agencies and Individuals. Weather
information will not be released to non-DoD agencies or the general public without approval
from the 60 AMW Public Affairs or 60 AMW/JA. Department of Defense contractors on Travis
AFB will be supported once verification of their status is received. Any questions/clarifications
will be coordinated through the WF Chief or NCOIC.
1.10. Post-Mission Analysis/Feedback. Per AFMAN 15-129, Chapter 4, units that utilize WF
services are expected to provide post-mission and utilization feedback as requested from the WF.
This feedback data will be entered into a database for evaluation by WF leadership to determine
the effectiveness, relevancy, and accuracy of the weather products and services.
   1.10.1. Formal/informal feedback methods include:
TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011                                                                    11


       1.10.1.1. Completing weather de-briefs provided with mission execution forecasts
       (MEFs). These feedback forms can be given to the on-duty forecaster.
       1.10.1.2. Faxing feedback to the WF.
       1.10.1.3. Sending email to the WF Chief or NCOIC at 60OSS.OSW1@US.AF.MIL.
       1.10.1.4. Giving face-to-face feedback to the person providing any service or briefing.
       1.10.1.5. Respond to email feedback request sent from the WF or completing feedback
       on the WF SharePoint page.
   1.10.2. Representative sample sizes are necessary to accurately reflect the customer‘s
   satisfaction and accuracy of weather services provided. This need underscores the
   importance of receiving feedback from all supported customers. The need for feedback is
   especially critical for determining the effectiveness of MEFs provided to aircrews.
1.11. Mishap Procedures. When an aircraft or ground mishap occurs (weather related or not)
requiring OPREP-3 reporting, WF personnel will follow the aircraft mishap procedures outlined
in AFMAN 15-129. WF forecasters will ensure all locally generated data used in the
development of any weather information, product, service, or support provided to a customer (to
include forms, tactical decision aids, space weather products, mission impact slides, weather
sensor data, etc.) are saved. The 25 OWS has robust data save capabilities and will save all
perishable data (satellite imagery, radar imagery, weather model charts, hazard charts, and JET
server data, etc) when requested to do a data save by the WF. The WF and OWS will save
enough data before and after the mishap to fully reconstruct the environmental conditions that
may have contributed to the mishap. If the WF used products from other OWS‘s to support
missions crossing areas of responsibility, they must coordinate with all applicable OWS‘s to
initiate the required data saves. WF members will also coordinate with agencies (TACC, other
Weather Flights, etc) that provided products, services, and information related to the mishap to
coordinate data saves. The WF will coordinate with the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA)
Operations Center to save any applicable data not saved by other sources.

                                 MISSION INFORMATION

2.1. General. TAFB has many different organizations limited by a variety of weather
parameters. This chapter will identify local weapons systems, the TAFB‘s most common
missions and operating areas, and their associated weather sensitivities and limitations.
2.2. Supported Organization/Missions/Requirements. Table 2.1 identifies the organizations
(and their subordinate units) supported by the WF and their primary missions. It also lists the
other tables in this document that identify limitations for their missions.

Table 2.1. Travis AFB Agency/Mission/Requirement Listing
 Organization        Mission                                    Requirements
 60/349 AMW          Provide airlift and air refueling for      All watches/warnings, see

 6B)                 Command Authorities.
2.3. Geographic Area of Responsibility. The WF provides mission-tailored weather support
for flying areas used by assigned or attached units to TAFB. TAFB‘s area of responsibility is
broad, but mainly focuses on the Western United States and Pacific. However, due to the wide-
ranging mission requirements, the WF‘s focus may need to be expanded to cover the entire
globe.
2.4. Airframe-Specific Weather Limitations. Airframe weather limitations based on the AFI
11-(series), and Joint METOC Training Handbook, Annex D identify weather limits for TAFB
airframe. A list of Travis aircraft Go/No-Go weather thresholds is listed in Attachment 3.
Customers will be advised of weather conditions on applicable mission execution forecast (see
Chapter 4). Airframe limitations will be validated annually by 60 OG/OGV and Navy VQ-3
Operations Officer. WF Leadership will document this annual review and make changes to
Go/No-Go thresholds as required.
2.5. Training Missions, Operating Areas, and Weather Sensitivities. Because the TAFB
flying mission is generally executed throughout the Western United States, there are very few
instances when weather will make an operating area completely unusable. Pilots have the
option, based on mission ORM principles, to determine if a mission is a ―go‖ or ―no-go‖
regardless of the weather phenomena provided in the mission execution forecast products.
TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011                                                               13


2.6. Ground Maintenance Limitations: Weather phenomena impact nearly every organization
on the installation. Customers should reference host Group and Squadron Operating Instructions
for limitations. Examples include 60/349 MXGOI 21-101 and CE 10-02.
2.7. Limitations to Other Ground Operations: The needs and weather mission sensitivities of
the many agencies supported by the WF vary greatly based on changing mission requirements.
In addition to the other mission limitations already documented in this instruction, there are
many other missions performed by base agencies that are significantly impacted by weather. WF
personnel should consider the potential impacts when providing forecast information to base
agencies. Some examples of impacted missions are construction projects, assemblies of large
numbers of people such as Change of Command ceremonies or air shows, or environmental
impact studies conducted by civil engineers. Weather conditions such as heavy rain, high winds,
or extreme temperatures impact many customers in many different ways, so the accuracy and
timeliness of this forecast information is important and relied upon heavily by base agencies.
WF personnel will follow up with supported customers if the forecast information given them
changes is such a way that it will impact mission accomplishment. Supported agencies should
alert the WF of potential weather impacts to their operations.

                                          Chapter 3

                            AIRFIELD SERVICES FUNCTION

3.1. General. Airfield Services include those actions that affect the Travis aerodrome (defined
within 5 miles of the airfield) or the base as a whole and are performed IAW duty priorities.
Examples include weather observations, PMSV, and resource protection. Resource protection
will be addressed in Chapter 8. Airfield Services is normally performed by one forecaster per
shift in conjunction with Mission Services support that is addressed in Chapter 4.
3.2. Operational Hours. Airfield Services excluding observing and resource protection
functions are provided 0600-1800L Monday-Friday excluding holidays and 60 AMW down
days. Observation functions are provided 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by the AMS in
Automated mode. Resource protection support is provided 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by the
25 OWS.
   3.2.1. During station closure, the 25 OWS will issue all observed weather advisories,
   increase surveillance of weather observations and forecast conditions and notify the standby
   forecaster when convective weather Watch, Warning, or Advisory (WWA) are required or
   any WWAs or SWAP criteria are issued.
   3.2.2. During WF closure, WF primary phone numbers will instruct the caller to contact the
   WF‘s standby cellular phone.
3.3. Recall of WF personnel. If the WF is unmanned, the standby forecaster will return to the
weather station and increase 25 OWS eyes forward support for any of the following reasons:
   3.3.1. At the discretion of the WF Superintendent, WF NCOIC, 60 OSS Commander or
   Operations Officer, or higher echelon Commander or Deputy Commander.
   3.3.2. Issuance of any observed warning.
   3.3.3. Issuance of any Convective watch/warning (excluding 35kt Wind Warning) or criteria
   that requires activation of Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). See Chapter 8 for a
   complete list of watches and warnings.
   3.3.4. The forecast occurrence of any Convective Watch/Warning, Lightning
   Watch/Warning, High Wind Warning (GTE 50kts warning only), or any SWAP criteria:
   OWS duty forecaster will contact the on-call WF standby forecaster via the recall cell phone.
   The standby forecaster will initiate SWAP procedures if necessary upon arrival at the
   weather station. WF personnel will report one hour before forecast valid time.
   3.3.5. Any AMS outage (most likely detected by tower personnel or 25 OWS forecasters).
   During AMS system outage or sensor failure, WF personnel will back-up the AMS
   observation elements and remarks IAW AFMAN 15-111 table 3.2 and 3.3. If the outage is
   related to a discontinuity sensor group, (i.e., visibility measurement from an inactive runway
   sensor), WF personnel will not back-up the sensor information.
   3.3.6. Mandatory AMS supplemental requirements as listed in paragraph 3.5.8.              WF
   personnel will report two hours before forecast valid time.
   3.3.7. All ground and air mishaps meeting OPREP-3 requirements.
TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011                                                                  15


   3.3.8. Change in active runway heading. WF personnel can change the primary sensor
   heading via remote connection when available.
   3.3.9. Any TACC outage affecting weather briefing support for Travis AFB missions.
   3.3.10. Any Navy VQ-3 mission requiring WF support or short-notice Air Force missions
   not supported the TACC or OWS.
   3.3.11. The above recall criteria is subject to change based on customer needs and may be
   made more or less stringent based on operational requirements.
3.4. Observations. Observations are taken, recorded, and disseminated IAW AFMAN 15-111,
Surface Weather Observations. Observations typically contain the following elements:
observation type; date/time; winds; visibility; present weather; cloud groups; temperature/dew-
point; altimeter setting; and additional remarks. The AMS operates in one of three modes: Auto,
Supplement, or Back-up. In Auto mode, the system operates without any WF interaction. All
observations are transmitted automatically. Supplement mode is the process of the WF manually
adding data to an observation generated by AMS that is beyond that system‘s capability to
measure and report. Examples of supplemented parameters are volcanic ash or tornadic activity.
Back-up mode consists of the WF manually editing meteorological data when the primary
automated method is unavailable, or when an element is unrepresentative and considered
operationally significant. An example of when back-up mode might be used is to when one or
more AMS components are out of service. There are three types of observations (described
below) that are seen by customers on Travis AFB. For all observations, the AMS will be
assumed to be in Auto mode, even during supplement or back-up mode of operations.
Attachment 6 contains examples of the different types of observations.
   3.4.1. METAR (Aviation Routine Weather Report). METAR observations are taken and
   disseminated every hour between 55 and 59 minutes after the hour. A METAR observation
   will be disseminated even when special weather criteria are met during the observation
   period. See Attachment 4 for special observation criteria. METAR observations are
   disseminated both locally and longline.
   3.4.2. SPECI (Aviation Selected Special Weather Report). SPECI observations are taken
   whenever certain weather events, defined in AFMAN 15-111 and within this document
   (listed in Attachment 4) occur at Travis. These observations are disseminated both locally
   and longline.
   3.4.3. LOCAL (Aviation Selected Local Weather Report). A LOCAL is an unscheduled
   observation reported to the nearest minute, not meeting SPECI criteria sent to local
   customers only. LOCALs will only be taken during back-up mode of the AMS pressure
   sensor.
   3.4.4. Official Observing Site. This is the physical location from which the AMS determines
   sky condition, present weather, and prevailing visibility. Travis‘ official observation site is
   located at the primary and discontinuity AMS sensor sites on the runway. There are four
   sensors groups on the airfield. During supplement or back-up of the AMS, the forecaster will
   determine the current weather conditions from the observation point located on the roof of
   Building P-4.
 16                                                        TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011


3.5. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). Weather personnel conduct a BWW from the official
manual observation site IAW AFMAN 15-111. This process is where the WF routinely
evaluates weather conditions at an interval not to exceed 20 minutes since the last observation or
evaluation of weather conditions to determine the need for a SPECI observation. WF personnel
will only conduct a BWW when the AMS is not functioning properly and manual back-up of the
AMS is required. If the AMS appears to not function properly, WF personnel will manually
monitor weather conditions when any of the conditions in paragraphs 3.5.1 to 3.5.7 are
observed to be occurring or are forecasted to occur within one hour. WF personnel will
immediately logout equipment with the 60 Communications Squadron (60 CS) and use back-up
equipment until the AMS can be evaluated and/or repaired by maintenance technicians. When
flight safety emergencies warrant, WF personnel will perform back-up observation procedures
and log in equipment once the emergency terminates:
   3.5.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.
   3.5.2. Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet.
   3.5.3. Visibility decreases to less than 3 miles (4,800 meters).
   3.5.4. Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 miles (4,800 meters).
   3.5.5. Convective and/or tornadic activity is occurring.
   3.5.6. Fog or Mist.
   3.5.7. Precipitation (any form).
NOTE: In addition to the above minimum requirements, weather personnel will remain alert for
any other changes in weather conditions that may require a SPECI observation. Weather
personnel will also monitor area observation and forecast products as often as necessary to keep
abreast of changes expected to affect their area of responsibility.
   3.5.8. WF personnel will also perform a Basic Weather Watch (BWW) and be ready to
   supplement the observation when the airfield is open and the following weather conditions
   are forecast to occur within two hours:
       3.5.8.1. .Tornado
       3.5.8.2. Funnel Cloud
       3.5.8.3. Waterspout
       3.5.8.4. Hail ½ or greater
       3.5.8.5. Volcanic Ash
Note: The immediate reporting of funnel clouds takes precedence over any other phenomena.
Technicians will log on to the AMS and be prepared to supplement for tornadic activity any time
a watch or warning has been issued for the phenomena.
3.6. Continuous Weather Watch. A continuous weather watch is the process by which
weather personnel or equipment continuously watch weather conditions without performing any
other duties. The AMS performs this capability. During manual observation mode, there is no
requirement nor is there the manpower capability to perform a continuous weather watch.
TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011                                                                      17


3.7. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). A CWW is a process for Air Traffic Control
(ATC), pilots, local law enforcement or other reliable sources to report changes in weather
conditions to the weather forecaster. WF personnel will evaluate the AMS output and compare it
to the information received from reliable sources. If deemed un-representative of the actual
weather conditions on the runway complex, WF personnel will initiate maintenance actions and
begin back-up observation procedures. If the conditions require immediate reporting, WF
personnel will generate a SPECI observation. If the condition does not require immediate
reporting, the information will be included in the next required METAR or SPECI observation.
   3.7.1. CWW inherently dictates close contact between the Travis WF and the previously
   mentioned organizations or personnel, especially tower personnel. WF leadership are
   responsible for ensuring CWW compliance by coordinating requirements with associated
   unit leadership.
   3.7.2. Tower personnel will notify weather personnel when any of the following are seen or
   occur on Travis AFB and are not included in the current observation:
       3.7.2.1. Rapid decrease of visibility that lowers any sector visibility to below four miles.
       3.7.2.2. Precipitation starts or stops.
       3.7.2.3. Thunderstorms and/or lightning are initially observed.
       3.7.2.4. Any time special criteria for prevailing visibility listed in Attachment 4 is met
       and it is different from what is currently being reported in the observation.
       3.7.2.5. Wind gusts of 25 knots or greater, when no gusts are forecasted.
       3.7.2.6. All received Pilot Reports. Tower personnel will relay all received reports
       within 5 minutes of receipt.
       3.7.2.7. Any other meteorological condition that could have significant impact on the
       airfield or aircraft operations (hail, wind damage, etc) or flight safety.
NOTE: Due to the distance between airfield sensors and the tower and the height of the tower
cab it is quite possible for there to be a significant difference in tower visibility and AMS values.
3.8. METWATCH and MISSIONWATCH. METWATCH provides an organized approach
for weather personnel to maintain situational awareness of the current/future meteorological
situation within a designated area(s). This process involves notifying supported units and
updating any forecast products when pre-established weather conditions or unforecast changes
(timing, location, or forecast values) in weather occur or are expected to occur. All on-site
meteorological and commercial data sources (meteorological satellite, weather radar, websites,
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather radio, etc.) may be used to
accomplish this task. The 25 OWS will perform a continuous Terminal METWATCH for Travis
AFB. WF personnel will act as the ―eyes forward‖ for the 25 OWS by providing immediate
feedback on current or short-term anticipated changes in weather conditions. The WF will
perform Flight and Route MISSIONWATCH for flights departing Travis AFB that were briefed
and controlled by WF personnel.
3.9. Eyes Forward Process and Procedures. The ―eyes forward‖ function is a process where
the WF provides meaningful meteorological information not contained in the standard weather
observations to the 25 OWS as an integral part of the 25 OWS METWATCH process. This
 18                                                     TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011


information may include subtle changes in weather conditions not encoded in observations, such
as fog banks visible nearby that might move over the runway complex, clouds getting darker in
color, rainfall picking up slightly, etc. This information should be relayed to the 25 OWS via
phone calls, emails, etc.
3.10. PMSV Support. Weather information is available via PMSV on frequency 271.1 MHz
except during periods of WF closure. The duty forecaster will continuously monitor PMSV
communications traffic when on-duty. However, given the one-deep manning at the WF, there
will be short periods of time where the PMSV will not be continuously monitored. For aircraft
outside the range of our PMSV system, the WF can provide PMSV support through a phone
patch to the 60 AMW/CP. During periods of limited METWATCH when the PMSV is not
monitored by WF personnel, aircraft requiring PMSV support can contact the regional OWS.
3.11. Weather Sensors. When ATC personnel are not able to change the appropriate AMS
weather sensors to match the active runway, WF personnel will manually switch the active
runway sensor suite when notified by ATC personnel of an active runway change. Attachment
10 shows the location of the meteorological sensors on the Travis Airfield.
TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011                                                               19

                             MISSION SERVICES FUNCTION

4.1. General. Mission Services are those actions directly related to completing each customer‘s
daily mission(s) (e.g., Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts, Mission Execution Forecast, Flight
Weather Briefings) and are performed IAW duty priorities. The Mission Execution Forecast
Process (MEFP) is the primary mechanism used to create tailored customer specific Mission
Execution Forecast. MEFs are tailored to individual customer requirements and may be anything
from a flight weather briefing to a change-of-command weather forecast. Travis‘s primary MEF
is the Flight Weather MEF developed for our flying customers. Any event, both flying and non-
flying, that will be affected by weather normally requires some sort of MEF.
4.2. Operational Hours. Based on Weather ORM, Mission Services are normally Monday-
Friday 0600-1800L, excluding holidays and 60 AMW down days, by one forecaster per shift in
conjunction with the Airfield Services functions addressed in Chapter 3. If manning levels
permit and mission workload warrants, two forecasters may be assigned to a shift. In this
situation one forecaster may be dedicated solely to Mission Services. If missions dictate,
Mission Services support will be provided around-the-clock.
4.3. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs). Travis AFB TAFs will be produced and
disseminated by the 25 OWS IAW AFI 15-128, AFMAN 15-124, AFMAN 15-129, and 25
OWS/60 OSS Memorandum of Agreement. Forecast specification and amendment criteria are
listed in Attachment 5. TAFs are valid for 24 hours, apply to the area within 5-nautical miles
(nm) of the TAFB airfield complex, and will be issued at 0100, 0900, and 1700 Zulu time.
Attachment 6 contains examples of typical Travis AFB TAFs.
4.4. 618 Tanker Airlift Control Center Missions (TACC). The bulk of flying operations at
Travis are supported in a weather capacity by TACC. For all TACC controlled missions, the WF
will:
   4.4.1. Shadow weather packages in Global Decision Support System 2 (GDSS) and back-up
   TACC in the event of communication failure or operations tempo IAW MWS
   implementation plan.
   4.4.2. Subscribe to and monitor Weather Threat Assessment (WTA) notifications for 60
   AMW missions. This will allow the weather flight to provide updates to aircrews via PMSV,
   phone-patch etc. when requested. NOTE: Coordinate with TACC if weather deviates from
   the published WTA.
   4.4.3. Monitor GDSS to ensure missions requiring weather support are identified and
   assigned ―618‖ in the ―Srt Alloc 2‖ column on the Mission Dashboard.
   4.4.4. Ensure all planning products are horizontally consistent with the WTA.
4.5. Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP). The MEFP is an organized approach to
standardize and apply operational thresholds within a repeatable process to best utilize
environmental information. The MEFP is broken into two phases, the Staff Phase and Forecast
Phase. Specific MEFP phase information is detailed in WF SOPs.
 20                                                      TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011


   4.5.1. MEFP Staff Phase. This phase consists primarily of WF leadership determining
   operational thresholds and processes to provide support.
   4.5.2. MEFP Forecast Phase. In this phase, WF forecasters develop situational awareness of
   environmental conditions and determine threats, generating MEFs using parameters derived
   from the Staff Phase. MEFs are created for both flying and non-flying activities. MEFs are
   mission-specific forecasts may be provided by a number of methods (web-based, verbally,
   person-to-person, etc). MEFs must be horizontally consistent with (but not necessarily
   mirror) products issued by the 25 OWS, AFWA, TACC, and other weather squadrons as
   necessary depending on location of the mission. Any differences between MEFs and
   products issued by other agencies must be coordinated in advance, however during rapidly
   changing conditions, emergencies, or when conditions threaten resource protection, the WF
   will amend the MEF to accurately reflect conditions and coordinate with other agencies as
   necessary when time permits.
       4.5.2.1. MEFs are generated as required for scheduled missions and are normally
       presented and briefed at the forecast counter at the WF office. They can also be faxed,
       posted to the WF Community of Practice or SharePoint, or emailed as requested.
       Aircrews who initially receive their MEF via computer, email or fax should contact the
       duty forecaster in person or on the phone to complete the briefing process. Once briefed
       and based on ORM, the duty forecaster will perform a MISSIONWATCH for mission
       limiting weather for Travis, route weather, and planned destinations. If weather crosses
       any mission limiting threshold at any time for any mission, the forecaster will notify the
       60 AMW/CP who will in turn notify the aircraft commander. MEFs are normally ready
       for pickup three hours prior to takeoff. An example of a completed MEF is shown in
       Attachment 8.
       4.5.2.1.1. Travis MEF Briefing. This is the primary MEF for all Travis flying missions
       not managed by TACC or OWS. MEFs include forecasted take-off weather, winds and
       hazards en-route, AR, MOA, DZ, or LZ forecasts, landing weather, and aircraft specific
       weather elements. In addition, based on specific crew requirements, space weather
       products are used to predict performance of HF, UHF, and GPS.
       4.5.2.2. Verbal MEF. Aircrews flying local missions may request a verbal briefing if no
       significant weather concerns are forecasted for their mission time. The information will
       be recorded on the verbal briefing log maintained in the WF. Once briefed and based on
       ORM, the duty forecaster will perform a MISSIONWATCH for mission limiting weather
       for Travis, route weather, and planned destinations. If weather crosses any threshold at
       any time for any mission, the forecaster will notify the 60 AMW/CP who will in turn
       notify the aircraft commander.
4.6. Situational Awareness Weather Sheet. The Travis Situational Awareness sheet is created
twice daily NLT 0700L and 1400L Monday-Friday and is for informational purposes only. It
contains the most current weather data, climb data information, local hazards, and local sunrise
and sunset. The morning data sheet is emailed to all 60 Operations Group Commanders. An
example of a completed sheet is shown in Attachment 9.
4.7. Transient Aircraft Weather Briefings. Travis WF forecaster will provide verbal
briefings, Flight Weather Briefing (FWB), and/or updates to any FWB to all transient aircrews
unless mission priorities preclude them from doing so. FWBs are created using the same format
TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011                                                                 21


as the normally produced Travis MEF. Due to the variety of transient airframes that transition in
and out of Travis, WF personnel cannot provide the same level of mission tailored support as
provided to locally assigned airframes. When a transient crew requires support during WF
closure, computer access is located in the Airfield Management Flight Planning Room that
provides access to the 25 OWS Flight Briefing section responsible for supporting transient
aircrews. Transient aircrews requiring FWB support from the TAFB WF or OWS should
provide a minimum of 2-hour advance notice before FWBs are needed. Aircrews not providing
this notice will still receive support based on mission priorities, but FWB support may be
delayed based on other mission requirements.
4.8. Integrated Flight Managed (IFM) Briefings. Aircrew flying IFM mission will retrieve
IFM packages from GDSS or the 60 OSS Airfield Management Office.
   4.8.1. MISSIONWATCH. This term is used to describe the process by which the WF
   monitors forecasted weather conditions for all missions receiving Travis MEFs. All on-site
   meteorological data sources (METSAT, weather radar, websites, etc.) may be used to
   accomplish this task and is the primary responsibility of the duty forecaster. WF personnel
   will use Air Force, DoD, or Government produced weather products. Civilian or
   commercially produced weather applications will only be used as a last resort. During
   rapidly changing weather, the WF will amend and update the MEF as required and contact
   the Tower or Command Post to pass on updates critical to mission success. MEFs will be
   MISSION WATCHED through the duration of the mission to ensure significant changes in
   weather conditions are monitored. WF forecasters will use ORM principles to focus their
   attention on the highest weather priority missions (areas with the greatest potential for
   mission limiting weather get the most attention). Based on ORM principles, forecasters will
   not leave the weather station (limited metwatch) unless all forecasted weather parameters
   impacting active, airborne missions are forecasted to have no weather restrictions or limiters
   and there are no weather systems expected to change the forecasted conditions (i.e.,
   approaching weather fronts or low pressure systems).

                                      STAFF SERVICES

5.1. General. WF leadership provides a direct interface to the 60 OSS/CC and staff and assists
the 60 AMW/CC in developing installation weather support plans and processes. Staff support
also includes briefings that are specialized planning forecast focused towards a particular event
or audience. Examples include, but are not limited to, staff meetings, Installation Control Center
(ICC) briefings, Assumptions of Alert Briefings (AoA), Instrument Refresher Course (IRC)
briefings, and exercise/event planning activities that involve local flying units (RODEO, JFEX).
5.2. Operational Hours. Staff Services support is provided during normal duty hours (0730-
1630L). Contingency, emergency, and exercise briefings are provided as required. Given the
one-deep manning for WF leadership, there will be times where requested staff support briefings
cannot be provided.
5.3. Staff Briefings. Staff weather briefings for 60 AMW are provided when required or upon
request when inclement weather could impact Travis AFB or missions being executed by Travis
AFB units. Standard information may include satellite and radar imagery, 5-day graphic weather
outlooks, and stop-light charts identifying weather impacts on TAFB missions. Other data is
provided upon request or tailored to a specific event.
5.4. Air Traffic Control (ATC) Limited Observation Training. ATC Limited Observing
Training is provided by the weather flight. The ATC individual seeking training will call the
weather flight and schedule a training appointment with the Flight NCOIC.
5.5. IRC Briefings. IRC briefings for the 60/349 AMW are conducted as needed with in-person
presentations whenever possible. All IRC weather briefings must be scheduled in advance with
a minimum of 2 days advance notice.
5.6. ICC Briefings. The WF will provide weather briefings as required for ICC briefings. This
includes real-world emergency, exercise, and deployment briefings. Each briefing will be
tailored to provide the appropriate weather intelligence required by wing leadership.
5.7. Climatology Information. Climatological summaries are provided to wing agencies on an
as needed basis and are available upon request by other base agencies. Other climatological
information will be provided on a case-by-case basis after validation of the requirement and
requester. It may take several days to collect the data required for these summaries, so all
requests for this service should be provided to the WF with as much advance notice as possible.
5.8. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Weather Updates. The WF is responsible for
ensuring all weather information in the FLIP is accurate. All weather related updates will be
requested through the Airfield Management Operations (60 OSS/OSAA) FLIP Manager. The
FLIP Manager will process the information to AFFSA/OL-D. Updates will fall in one of three
categories: revisions, changes, or corrections. WF leadership will review each new FLIP
distribution for accuracy.
5.9. Pre-deployment Planning Briefings (Concept Briefing). The WF will provide pre-
deployment weather briefings when requested for deploying units. The content of the briefing
vary depending on the customer‘s requirements. For example, an aviation unit will receive
weather impacts at the deployed location on their flying mission in addition to the standard
TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011                                                                   23


surface weather information usually presented to ground units. A ground based unit, like the
security forces, will receive a briefing on surface temperatures, wind speed, potential for blowing
sand and dust, and precipitation.
5.10. Execution Briefings: Upon the Notification of the Assumption of Alert briefings the WF
will provide an in-depth weather briefing and weather packets to the alerted crews.

                                            Chapter 6

                      SPACE WEATHER SUPPORT AND SERVICES

6.1. General. Many of our weapons and communications systems use satellites and radio waves
(High Frequency (HF), Very High Frequency (VHF), Ultra High Frequency (UHF), and Satellite
Communications (SATCOM)), that can be rendered useless by electro-magnetic radiation from
the sun. This chapter contains some brief information regarding space weather limitations, alerts
and warnings, and products available to Travis personnel.
6.2. Limitations. Like terrestrial weather, there are numerous factors that influence space
weather. One of the biggest limitations we have in identifying and forecasting space weather is a
lack of sensors. Additionally, given the speed of solar wind and light, our ability to provide lead-
times for significant space events is extremely limited.
6.3. Space Weather Alerts and Warnings. Travis AFB missions have a wide-variety of
parameters possibly affected by various space weather conditions (HF and UHF communication,
radar, GPS Comm, etc). Broad coverage CONUS-based space weather products (graphics) and
bulletins are available at https://weather.afwa.af.mil/space.html. These products will be used
to update the Space Weather portion (HF, UHF, and GPS) of Flight MEFs.
6.4. Products. Most space weather products available from the Air Force Weather Agency
(AFWA) are ―now-casts‖ and/or very short-term forecasts (6-hourly periods), so duty forecasters
will regularly check the links on the MISSION WATCH page of the MEFP Daily Workbook.
WF forecasters may be able to provide further information on space products.
6.5. Solar and Lunar Data. All solar and lunar information provided by the WF will be
leveraged from the 25 OWS or US Naval Observatory websites.
6.6. Tactical Decision Aids. Travis assigned aircraft do not require Target Acquisition Weather
information. The WF will maintain a Target Acquisition Weather Software account or media
solely for Light and Lunar data information and mobility proficiency only.
TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011                                                                    25

                           SPECIAL MISSION REQUIREMENTS

7.1. General. This chapter contains all of the specific local requirements submitted by various
organizations throughout Travis AFB that have been verified by the WF leadership. The
requirements will be reviewed annually by the requesting unit and updated as required. If
changes to the requirements documented below occur, WF leadership will adjust procedures to
include the new requirements. Each supported customer is responsible for contacting the WF
should their requirements change.
7.2. 60 AMW Commander (60 AMW/CC) and Director of Staff (60 AMW/DS). 60
OSS/OSW will:
   7.2.1. Provide weather briefings products at scheduled 60 AMW staff meetings, and in-
   person briefings upon request.
   7.2.2. Respond to any recall as required by the 60 AMW Commander.
7.3. 60 AMW Safety (60AMW/SEG). 60 OSS/OSW will:
   7.3.1. Provide meteorological data and/or personnel to assist in the investigation of ground
   or aircraft mishaps, as required.
   7.3.2. Provide personnel to Wing Safety to serve as accident board members.
7.4. 60th Communications Squadron (60 CS). 60 OSS/OSW will:
   7.4.1. Notify the 60 CS focal point of all communications and equipment outages, or
   interruptions and when equipment is returned to service.
   7.4.2. Weather personnel will open and close all job control numbers regarding
   meteorological and communications support equipment with customer service, except Joint
   Environmental Toolkit (JET) system, and weather radar outages not related to local circuits.
   7.4.3. Request tours of airfield meteorological equipment at least 48 hours in advance. WF
   leadership will survey all fixed equipment at least annually.
7.5. 60th Operations Support Squadron Airfield Operations Flight (60 OSS/OSA). 60
OSS/OSW will:
   7.5.1. Provide training and certification for air traffic control personnel to participate in the
   Cooperative Weather Watch Program as described in Chapter 3 of this document and on
   general local weather phenomena. This includes training on the following minimum items:
       7.5.1.1. Interpretation and decoding of METAR, special and local observations.
       7.5.1.2. Interpretation and decoding of Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs).
       7.5.1.3. Proper determination of prevailing and sector visibility.
       7.5.1.4. Locations and use of weather station equipment.
       7.5.1.5. Development, use and maintenance of visibility charts and photographs.
 26                                                        TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011


      7.5.1.6. Runway and airfield lighting change procedures as they relate to their impact on
      weather equipment performance.
   7.5.2. Notify the Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) and Tower chief controllers of newly-
   assigned OSW personnel requiring indoctrination on the local ATC mission, effects of
   weather on the local air traffic system and the importance of timely receipt of weather
   information by air traffic controllers. All training for weather personnel will be scheduled
   through the WF Chief or NCOIC.
   7.5.3. Evaluate weather conditions when Tower/RAPCON personnel report significant
   differences between the weather conditions they observe and what is reported in the latest
   observation. Back-up procedures for the AMS will be used by WF personnel when they
   determine the AMS is reporting unrepresentative data and the AMS is logged out with 60 CS.
   Prevailing visibility is an element that has a significant impact on air operations and warrants
   close monitoring by both WF and ATC personnel when reported values are below 4 statute
   miles. WF personnel report tower visibility only when operating in BACK-UP mode when
   the AMS is not operating properly. Due to the distance between airfield sensors used by the
   AMS and the tower, it is quite possible for there to be a significant difference between
   accurate tower visibility and AMS values.
7.6. 615 Contingency Response Wing (615 CRW). 60 OSS/OSW will
   7.6.1. Provide training workspace and access to assigned equipment (tactical and garrison)
   for 615 CRW weather forecaster proficiency training.
   7.6.2. Distribute quarterly 25 OWS severe weather refresher training. 60 OSS/OSW will
   document via Memorandum for Record 615 CRW weather personnel completion and notify
   25 OWS of compliance.
   7.6.3. Provide back-up support to 615 CRW weather Staff Services functions during periods
   of limited 615 CRW manning (exercises, deployments).

                                            Chapter 8

                          RESOURCE PROTECTION SERVICES

8.1. General.
   8.1.1. This chapter contains details on weather watches, warnings, and advisories. Resource
   protection is accomplished through a joint effort between the 25 OWS and the Travis WF.
   The 25 OWS is responsible for issuing all forecasted products including weather watches and
   warnings and all observed warnings and advisories during WF closure periods. The WF acts
   as the ―eyes forward‖ for the 25 OWS, and is responsible for issuing all observed warnings
   and advisories during operating hours. However, the WF can issue any forecasted warnings
   if there is an immediate threat to life and/or property. In these cases, the WF will back brief
   the 25 OWS when time permits and will also be responsible for dissemination to local
   supported agencies. Conversely, the WF will act as the alternate dissemination/notification
   source for the 25 OWS. The goal is to provide the best possible resource protection to Travis
   AFB.
8.2. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice sent to customers indicating that
conditions are favorable for the development of a particular type of weather phenomena (e.g.,
tornadoes, hail, etc.). Watches are issued for a 5 nm radius in any direction from the perimeter of
the installation. Table 8.1 contains all of the weather watches and desired lead-times issued for
Travis AFB.

Table 8.1. Travis AFB Weather Watches
CRITERIA                                                        Desired Lead Time

Hail > ½ inch but < ¾ inch                                      As potential warrants
*Heavy Rain (> 2 inches in 12 hrs)                              As potential warrants
*Freezing Precipitation                                         As potential warrants
Lightning within 5 nm                                           30 minutes

*When issued will result in activation of the SWAP.
8.3. Weather Warnings. Weather warnings are special notices sent out to customers alerting
them that a predefined weather event, which will pose a threat to life or property, is expected to
occur. Warnings are issued for a 5 nm radius in any direction from the perimeter of the
installation. Forecasted warnings, with their desired lead-times, are contained in Table 8.2.

Table 8.2. Travis AFB Weather Warnings

Lightning within 5 nm                                           Not applicable; issue only when
                                                                observed

*When issued will result in activation of the SWAP.
8.4. Observed Weather Warnings (IAW AFOSH Standards 91-66 & 91-100). Lightning
warnings are the only type of observed warning issued on Travis AFB and are issued for a 5 nm
radius in any direction from the perimeter of the installation Lightning warnings are not issued
until lightning is observed, either visually or via the AMS. The National Lightning Detection
Network will also be utilized. The lightning warning will remain valid until lightning has not
occurred in the area for at least 15 minutes. A lightning warning will not be cancelled if a
thunderstorm is within 5 nm. The WF will provide timely notification to all supported units
upon issuance and expiration of a lightning warning (see Attachment 7).
8.5. Forecast Weather Advisories. Forecast weather advisories are special notices sent to
customers alerting them of the potential for predefined weather phenomenon to impact
operations occurring on Travis AFB. Forecast weather advisories can be found in Table 8.3.

Table 8.3. Travis AFB Forecast Weather Advisories
CRITERIA                                                          Desired Lead Time
Surface Winds > 25 but < 35 knots                                 30 min
8.6. Observed Weather Advisories. An observed weather advisory is a special notice sent to
customers alerting them that a predefined weather phenomenon which may impact operations is
occurring on Travis AFB. Observed weather advisories can be found in Table 8.4.

Table 8.4. Travis AFB Observed Weather Advisories
CRITERIA                                                         Desired Lead Time
Moderate or Greater Icing, not associated with thunderstorms,    Only when observed
below 10,000 ft AGL
Moderate or Greater Turbulence, not associated with              Only when observed
thunderstorms, below 10,000 AGL
Crosswind > 19 knots with a Wet Runway                           Only when observed
Crosswind > 12 knots with a Wet Runway                           Only when observed
Low Level Wind Shear (LLWS) below 2,000 ft AGL                   Only when observed
NOTE: Crosswinds are calculated based on the maximum observed wind gust or sustained
speed if no gust are occurring and worst case observed magnetic direction including variability.
Turbulence advisories are issued for category II aircraft.
   8.6.1. Format. Advisories, watches, and warnings are disseminated in a format described in
   Attachment 6. They are documented on the tracking log updated by the WF forecaster.
   8.6.2. Upgrades/Downgrades. Advisories and warnings will be upgraded (i.e., winds
   increase from 35 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the
   desired lead-times specified above. Only one forecasted warning may be in effect at one
TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011                                                                   29


   time. If a warning is issued for one criterion, and it becomes necessary to warn for other
   criteria, a new warning, with a new number, will be issued to include all criteria expected. A
   separate valid time may be specified for each criterion, if necessary.
   8.6.3. Amendments. Amendments to weather warnings and watches will only be issued to
   change the valid time or any typed errors. The amendment will be issued before the original
   watch or warning expires. New warnings and watches will be issued for any change in
   weather criteria.
   8.6.4. Cancellation. Warnings and watches may be canceled when the weather phenomena
   are no longer occurring or expected to occur. However, if not canceled, they will expire at
   the end of the valid period. Observed advisories will be canceled when the criteria is no
   longer occurring and is not expected to occur again in the next hour.
8.7. Toxic Corridor. Per AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program
Planning and Operations, the WF is responsible for providing only meteorological data towards
the calculation of toxic corridor products. The 25 OWS may also supplement the WF with this
weather data-only support, if required. The fire department has the primary responsibility for
toxic corridor calculations. Bioenvironmental Engineering assists in determining the health risks
due to the toxic corridor. The WF will provide meteorological data upon declaration of a major
HAZMAT or chemical spill by the Fire Chief.
8.8. Chemical Downwind Messages (CDM)/Effective Downwind Messages (EDM). The WF
is the primary unit for providing CDM/EDM support. They are used to determine the spread of
chemical and biological agents that are released. The EDM bulletin is produced by AFWA twice
a day based on 00Z and 12Z weather data and is used for forecasting threat areas for fallout from
a nuclear detonation. CDM bulletins can be produced in station but are also available on the 25
OWS website.
8.9. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). The SWAP is in place to ensure sufficient
personnel are available during potential/actual severe weather events or during
meteorological/operational events critical to mission success. For the purposes of these
procedures severe weather is defined as tornados, surface winds greater than or equal to 50
knots, hail greater than or equal to ¾-inch diameter, heavy rain (rainfall greater than 2 inches in
12 hours), and freezing precipitation.
   8.9.1. It is imperative that timely and accurate weather watches, warnings, and advisories are
   disseminated to all Travis AFB agencies to ensure personnel and resource protection. During
   SWAP activation, WF personnel will be recalled as required to efficiently handle forecast
   weather conditions and increased workload. Duty personnel will expand eyes forward
   responsibilities, supplement and/or back-up the AMS observation, enhance
   MISSIONWATCH, and increase surveillance of local and regional area conditions. The
   SWAP leader will perform OPREP reporting requirements. Specific SWAP procedures and
   reporting instructions (OPREP) are detailed in the Severe Weather Action and OPREP-3
   SOPs.
8.10. Tide Level Flood Threat Data for Travis AFB. The WF will notify the Travis Flood
Control Team when .50 inches or more of rain is forecasted to occur within a 12 hour period.
The Flood Control Team has the primary responsibility for obtaining and compiling tide data and
tide level predictions for any threat of a flood at Travis.

8.11. Miscellaneous Base Support. Agencies that require occasional basic weather support
may request general weather information, such as temperature or pressure, by calling the duty
forecaster. Some examples of agencies that may require this type of support are the Child
Development Centers, base construction agencies, and hospital clinics.
TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011                                                                    31


                                            Chapter 9

                      WEATHER INFORMATION DISSEMINATION

9.1. General: The WF will assist supported agencies in maintaining an efficient, effective
means of disseminating weather information. Procedures developed must ensure that weather
personnel do not spend more time communicating than monitoring weather conditions. These
procedures must also ensure the information is received by those who need it, which may require
inter-unit dissemination. Due to limited manning and the time-critical nature of this information,
the WF expects agencies with JET software to use them to their fullest potential, in conjunction
with the Local Weather Sheet and Travis AFB Weather SharePoint prior to contacting the WF.
9.2. Terms Explained:
   9.2.1. Longline Communications. Communications circuits that deliver weather products
   via NIPERNET Common User Communications (CUC).
   9.2.2. Local Communications. Weather products (TAFs, observations, PIREPs, etc.) are
   typically encoded differently for longline and local transmissions. Vital weather data for
   aircraft safety is now dependent upon the base network.
   9.2.3. Pilot Reports (PIREPs). Pilot reports of airborne weather conditions. A PIREP
   should include the location and flight level of the aircraft, time of observation, aircraft type,
   and description and extent of meteorological elements. PIREPs are normally transmitted
   both locally and longline.
9.3. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) Software: The primary means of disseminating
weather information on Travis AFB is via JET. JET software and hardware systems display a
continuous feed of the latest weather observation from the AMS and the latest terminal forecasts
or amendments and weather products issued by the 25 OWS and/or the WF.
   9.3.1. The following applies to all JET local transmissions:
       9.3.1.1. All wind directions are in degrees magnetic.
   9.3.1.2. All weather observation and TAF heights are AGL. Other products, such as
   weather advisories, reference MSL and AGL as appropriate, but are normally in reference to
   AGL.
       9.3.1.3. All observation distances are in statute miles.       All warning/watch/advisory
       distances are in nautical miles.
       9.3.1.4. Wind speeds are in knots.
       9.3.1.5. All times are in ZULU time (Z) unless the time is appended with an "L", in
       which case it is local time.
       9.3.1.6. Each agency experiencing a problem connecting to their JET account will report
       it to the WF so back-up procedures may be arranged and maintenance actions taken.
9.4. Weather Warnings, Watches, and Advisories (WWA) Dissemination: The timely
dissemination of WWA is critical to the ability of units to prepare/respond to the threat of
dangerous/mission limiting weather. WWAs are transmitted to customers using the JET system.
 32                                                       TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011


Many customers translate this data into function specific software, i.e., IDS-5 for ATC positions.
See Attachment 7 for a matrix of the recipients of Travis AFB issues WWA products.
   9.4.1. In the event of automated dissemination system failure, WF personnel will verbally
   disseminate WWAs to Tower and RAPCON positions first, followed by the order of
   precedence listed in Attachment 7.
9.5. Weather Observation and TAF Dissemination. In the event of automated dissemination
system failure, WF personnel will verbally disseminate observations and TAFs to Tower and
RAPCON positions first, followed by order of precedence listed in Attachment 7. After verbal
dissemination, products will be uploaded into the AF Weather distribution system. If the outage
is related to ATC owned software (IDS-5), ATC personnel will use JET to receive weather
information if possible.

                  WEATHER AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT

10.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by the WF. Additionally, it provides information on back-up
systems, maintenance, and restoring priorities.
10.2. Meteorological Equipment Locations and Limitations: Attachment 10 shows the
runway complex and the location of weather sensors. Readouts for all meteorological sensors
are located at the WF offices in Building #4. The primary runway is 21L/03R, a dual-
instrumented, Category II Instrument Landing System (ILS) runway. The secondary runway,
21R/03L, is parallel to the primary runway and begins where the primary ends. The primary
observing equipment includes the following:
   10.2.1. FMQ-19. This instrument is the primary weather measuring equipment. This system
   provides instrumentation for recording the temperature, relative humidity, dew point, wind
   direction, speed, gusts and variability, cloud heights and thickness up to and including 25,000
   feet. It also measures the visibility, runway visual range, precipitation, pressure, and cloud-
   to-ground and cloud-to-cloud lightning.
      10.2.1.1. Due to the FMQ-19 Runway Light Intensity Monitoring system not being
      installed at Travis AFB, the ―$‖ maintenance indicator will be appended to all
      observations disseminated by the FMQ-19.
   10.2.2. The primary equipment back-ups for the FMQ-19 are:
      10.2.2.1. Temperature/Dew Point: The first back-up is the Kestrel 4500, the second is
      the TMQ-53, tactical weather sensor. Both instruments provide temperature, dew point,
      wind speed and direction and pressure readings.
      10.2.2.2. Wind: The first back-up is the Kestrel 4500, the second is the TMQ-53, tactical
      weather sensor.
      10.2.2.3. RVR: There is no back-up to the FMQ-19 for RVR (runway visual range).
      10.2.2.4. Clouds: The first back-up is the TMQ-53, Tactical Meteorological Observing
      System. The TMQ-53 possesses a LBC (Laser beam Ceilometer) that sends a stationary
      laser vertically to determine cloud bases up to 25,000FT. To measure a cloud base, the
      cloud must be directly over the projector. The secondary back-up is the laser range
      finder.
      10.2.2.5. Rain Gauge: The only back-up is the plastic rain gauge located in the Manual
      Observing Kit.
      10.2.2.6. Atmospheric Pressure, Altimeter Setting: The Kestrel 4500 located in the WF
      is the primary back-up to the FMQ-19. The TMQ-53 can also be used. During AMS
      pressure sensor failures, WF personnel will distribute Altimeter local observations at an
      interval not to exceed 35 minutes when there has been a change of 0.01 inches of
      mercury or more since the last Altimeter value.
 34                                                       TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011


       10.2.2.7. Lightning Detection: The FMQ-19 and the National Lightning Detection
       network, accessed via AFWA‘s Joint Army Air Force Weather Information Network
       (JAAWIN) website, are our primary means of receiving lightning data. Internet sources
       that contain similar imagery will be used as auxiliary back-ups if available.
       10.2.2.8. Weather Radar. The NEXRAD (weather radar) antenna is located near Davis,
       CA, approximately 19 miles northeast of Travis. The display unit, or OPUP (Open
       Principal User Processor) is located in the WF, provides real-time storm interrogation
       capability.
10.3. Communications Equipment. Just as vital as meteorological equipment,
communications equipment allows the WF to get the right information to the right customer.
The following systems are the backbone of the WF communications network.
   10.3.1. JET. JET is the primary system for disseminating forecasts, observations, warnings,
   watches, advisories, and weather sensor information.
       10.3.1.1. Telephones are used as a back-up for key aircraft controlling agencies.
       10.3.1.2. Maintenance for equipment is provided by contract and limited support is
       provided by 60 CS for checking LAN connections and line status.
   10.3.2. PMSV Radio. The Pilot-To-Metro-Service Radio (271.1 MHz) allows the WF to
   communicate with aircrews, both on the ground and flying, as well as tower personnel.
   Maintenance is provided by 60 CS.
       10.3.2.1. If the PMSV is out of service, aircrews can contact the WF via phone patch
       (where possible) as a back-up to get weather data.
   10.3.3. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and hotlines primarily serve as back-up system as well as
   for passing along critical, time-sensitive information rapidly.
   10.3.4. LAN. The WF relies heavily on the local area network to improve the timeliness and
   accuracy of weather intelligence to our customers.
10.4. Building Power. Bldg P-4 is equipped with a back-up generator. The generator should
start up automatically when power is cut-off. CE performs quarterly tests to ensure the generator
is working properly.
TRAVISAFBI15-101 21 JUNE 2011                                                                 35

                             25 OWS/WF BACK-UP SUPPORT

11.1. 25 OWS Outages. The 25 OWS is heavily dependent on communication and computer
equipment; therefore, the 25 OWS is susceptible to a myriad of systems outages that could cause
a wide range of changes in mission capability. Typically outages do not last more than a few
hours and do not cause significant losses/degradation in mission capability, but the possibility
exists for the 25 OWS to lose total mission capability due to systems failure or a building
evacuation. Unfortunately, the 25 OWS and its supported units do not have adequate resources
to completely eliminate all degradation in weather operations during outages or evacuations.
However, the 25 OWS has established back-up procedures that are flexible and designed to meet
as many back-up requirements identified in AFMAN 15-129, as possible.
   11.1.1. Three-Tier Back-Up Support. IAW AFMAN 15-129 the 25 OWS will back-up the
   following products and services in prioritized order: Tier 1, Wartime, Contingencies,
   Military Operations Other Than War, and Force Protection; Tier 2, Peacetime and Exercise
   Operations; and Tier 3, Mission Planning, products and services.
   11.1.2. Alternate Sources of Weather Information. The 25 OWS has established an
   agreement with the 26 OWS, Barksdale AFB, LA, to host an alternate 25 OWS website that
   contains a select suite of key products. The 26 OWS will also provide back-up Flight
   Weather MEFs when needed. Additionally, supported units may access JAAWIN and
   National Weather Service websites for weather products. If an outage appears that it will last
   more than 72 hours, the 25 OWS will make arrangements to deploy personnel to an alternate
   location to set up temporary operations until the home station can be brought back on line.
   11.1.3. Travis WF Actions. The 25 OWS will ensure contact with all supported units,
   primarily via telephone. If conditions require, the 25 OWS will hand off responsibilities for
   the Travis AFB TAF, WWA and Flight Weather Briefings (including transient aircrews) to
   the Travis WF. However, the 25 OWS forecasters will maintain close contact with supported
   units via telephone, when feasible and when weather information is available, to aid in TAF,
   METWATCH, WWA, and Flight Weather MEF production.
   11.1.4. Contact with Supported Units. When the 25 OWS implements back-up procedures
   due to mission capability loss/degradation, it will contact WF‘s primary 24-hour POC, or
   alternate if necessary and available. Since the types of problems can vary greatly, the 25
   OWS will provide a brief description of the problem(s) and interim procedures for the
   supported unit to follow to receive weather support. The 25 OWS will also notify supported
   units when mission capability returns to normal and all services are restored.
11.2. WF. For evacuations of the WF from its primary location, support will resume from the
alternate operating location with the 25 OWS assuming responsibilities during any interim
period. For longer interruptions, the WF will coordinate required support with other
organizations. See Chapter 1 for more details on operations at the AOL. In the rare event that
the WF cannot provide weather data, the 25 OWS can be contacted anytime for weather briefings
and other required information.

  desk will forward the trouble ticket to the local base CFP . The base CFP will contact the
  AFWA Customer Service Center who will coordinate with the JET Support Team (JST) help
  desk to connect to the JET server via an AF-approved remote maintenance tool to perform
  server/system maintenance and troubleshooting actions, e.g., respond to JET performance
  irregularities. This may require the base CFP to initiate a remote maintenance session from
  the JET server. The use of the remote maintenance tool will significantly reduce the amount
  of assistance required by the local base CFP.
  A2.9.3. In the event the remote maintenance tool is unable to establish contact between the
  server and the JET help desk or if the remote maintenance tool is not operational, the JET
  ICS contractor help desk may request that the base CFP personnel perform touch
  maintenance to assist in various troubleshooting tasks to diagnose system errors and
  implement solutions if applicable.
  A2.9.4. In the event the previous processes cannot be accomplished or are unsuccessful, and
  at the direction of the JET PMO, the JET ICS Contractor will send personnel on site to
  restore the JET server/system.
  A2.9.5. JET specific hardware is covered under a four-year Dell Platinum service contract
  addressed in the JET Support Package delivered at each installation. JET ICS Contractor will
  contact Dell when required.

      feet. The example shows the base of the turbulence begins at the surface and extends to
      5,000 feet above the surface.
   A6.2.9. Minimum Altimeter Setting.
      A6.2.9.1. Altimeter is in reference to inches of mercury (inHg), with the decimal point
      removed.
      A6.2.9.2. Forecasted value is the minimum altimeter expected for the time covered in the
      applicable forecast group.
   A6.2.10. Temporary Condition Groups (TEMPO).
TEMPO 1602 1SM +SHRA BKN025 OVC050

      A6.2.10.1. Indicates a temporary fluctuation to forecast conditions (e.g. intermittent
      rain).

       A6.2.10.2. May contain all, some, or just one of the elements (excluding altimeter
       setting) listed in the above paragraphs.
       A6.2.10.3. When used, the valid time for the forecast intermittent conditions is from
       whole hour to whole hour as listed immediately after the TEMPO identifier. In the
       example above, the intermittent conditions are expected to occur from 16Z until 02Z.
   A6.2.11. Change Groups (BECMG).
BECMG 0203 18012G22KT 7SM SKC QNH3005INS T30/21Z T22/11Z

       A6.2.11.1. Used to indicate a change in forecast conditions expected to occur within a
       specified time period.
       A6.2.11.2. The specified time period will normally be one hour and will never exceed
       two hours.
       A6.2.11.3. BECMG groups will contain all elements.
       A6.2.11.4. The valid time of this group will be from the end time of the change, to the
       ending time of either forecast period or until the ending time of a subsequent BECMG
       group. In the example above, the change is forecast to begin after 02Z and end at 03Z.
       Therefore, the valid time for the conditions within the BECMG group would be from 03Z
       until the end of the forecast (12Z) since there are no subsequent BECMG groups.
   A6.2.12. Remarks.
BECMG 0203 18012G22KT 7SM SKC QNH3005INS T30/21Z T22/11Z

       A6.2.12.1. Remarks (if any) are always the last entries for each forecast group. Forecast
       maximum and minimum temperatures in Celsius, and projected hour (Z) of occurrence is
       included on the last line of the forecast.
