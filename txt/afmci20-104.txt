                                              Chapter 1

                                         INTRODUCTION

1.1. Background. In September 2002, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Logistics and
Materiel Readiness) disseminated a directive memorandum on Serialized Item Management
(SIM). This memorandum tasked the Military Departments and Defense Agencies to develop
SIM programs for select populations of items. It defined criteria for determining what shall be
included in a SIM program and highlighted the need to use automatic identification technology
(AIT) to support the collection of data associated to individual items. DoD Instruction 4151.19
refined and formalized the initial SIM policy using Item Unique Identification (IUID) as the
means to uniquely identify and mark items requiring serialized management. DoD Instruction
8320.04, dated June 2008, provides direction on implementing IUID.
1.2. IUID. Is the DoD’s initiative to mark qualifying tangible personal property with a symbol
containing a Unique Item Identifier (UII) data set to construct a globally unique and
unambiguous        item     identifier   using      the   International     Organization      for
Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 16022 EEC 200 two-
dimensional data matrix encoding. (Ref. Attachment 3 for specific data matrix format
requirements). AIT includes linear barcodes, two-dimensional barcodes, and radio-frequency
identification (RFID) technologies along with the computerized infra-structure of optical readers
and scanners to collect and associate data with items identified using AIT. These technologies
simplify identification by removing the necessity to manually enter data.
     1.2.1. Automated Information Systems (AIS) are computer information systems that store
     and process data collected using AIT to enable better decision processes concerning the
     management of items.
     1.2.2. SIM is differentiated from Serial Number Tracking (SNT) by the use of data for
     decision processes characterizing active management of an individual item or a population of
     like items. While SNT programs will gather data concerning the status of items with regards
     to what the item is, its physical location, its serviceability, and potentially who is accountable
     for it, SNT may or may not use the data to make informed decisions concerning how to
     manage the individual item or population of like items.
     1.2.3. The objective of SIM is to improve the availability of military equipment while
     reducing sustainment costs. This is achieved by having timely and reliable data on items, to
     include Class II military equipment, Class VII support equipment, and Class IX repairable
     items used by the Air Force. With higher quality data, better decisions concerning
     maintenance and procurement of items are feasible to ensure the proper items are available
     for Warfighters at the desired location, when needed without requiring excessive amounts of
     resources in secondary inventories.
     1.2.4. SIM, using IUID, will improve weapon system reliability and maintainability by
     providing the capability to uniquely track, monitor, and manage repairable assets across the
     maintenance enterprise. Uniquely identified repairable assets will enable item managers,
     engineers, and maintenance personnel to identify ‘bad actor’ assets continually not meeting
     reliability standards. Removing ‘bad actor’ assets from the repairable asset pool, and

   providing reliable replacements, will decrease maintenance removals and asset repair actions
   thereby increasing weapon system reliability and maintenance capacity.
   1.2.5. IUID enabled SIM will provide enhanced capabilities throughout logistics,
   engineering, and financial management and will lead to supply chain optimization,
   performance improvements, and process streamlining.
   1.2.6. Improved logistics processes through IUID enabled SIM include depot maintenance,
   warranty management, safety and flight item management, and an overall improvement of
   the disposal process.
   1.2.7. The financial management community expects serialized item visibility to improve
   standing related to the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 including improved
   audits, physical inventory reporting, and more accurate asset valuation.
   1.2.8. Other benefits realized as a result of IUID enabled SIM include, parts life usage
   determination, parts availability, automated data capture, repair/materiel demand planning,
   deployed support equipment management, and timely parts location.
1.3. Purpose. The primary purpose IUID is to provide the AF the capability to generate and
collect item unique data for managing materiel of uniquely identified items in order to enhance
asset visibility, financial accountability, and improve weapon system life cycle management.
1.4. Scope. The scope of this instruction includes qualifying tangible personal property that
require item level traceability and are procured or sustained by AFMC. This includes Class II,
Class V, Class VII, Class VIII and Class IX items procured or sustained by others on behalf of
AFMC.

                                            Chapter 3

                ITEM UNIQUE IDENTIFICATION IMPLEMENTATION

3.1. General. Tangible personal property with an item level traceability requirement is a sub-
segment of the overall IUID implementation. Since IUID implementation is integral to instituting
SIM programs, this instruction will provide direction on implementing IUID for all qualifying
items with additional direction on items with item level traceability requirements.
   3.1.1. The AF utilizes an IUID candidate identification methodology based on classes of
   supply. Each class of supply (Class II, Class V, Class VII, Class VIII and Class IX) is
   analyzed for NSNs which meet OSD marking criteria and provide value to the AF.
3.2. Determining Items Requiring IUID Implementation.
   3.2.1. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) sets forth the policy for Department of
   Defense (DoD) IUID implementation.
   3.2.2. DoD Instruction 8320.04 and DFARS 211.274-2 establishes the criteria that qualify an
   item for IUID implementation.
3.3. The Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS) IUID Indicator.
   3.3.1. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)/Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS)
   created a field within the FLIS that includes an IUID indicator for inclusion of IUID for all
   stock listed items. With development of the FLIS indicator, all AF services and agencies will
   populate the FLIS with IUID requirements for all stock listed items.
       3.3.1.1. For all stock listed items, the IUID indicator in FLIS must be referenced to
       determine IUID marking requirements.
       3.3.1.2. If the material manager (IM/ES) determines that a change is required to the IUID
       indicator, the material manager must send a change request to the PM as well as to the
       AIT PO. The change request must include justification for the change to the IUID
       indicator.
       3.3.1.3. If the change request is accepted, the PM must update the applicable IUID
       implementation plan accordingly.
           3.3.1.3.1. PMs must ensure that the IUID Indicator is updated for all items included
           in their implementation plans, and include setting the IUID indicator as part of
           standard cataloging.
       3.3.1.4. If the change request is rejected, the IUID indicator will remain as is.
       3.3.1.5. The AIT PO shall coordinate all accepted FLIS updates monthly.
       3.3.1.6. Requiring activity must ensure all contracts include IUID when indicated as a
       requirement in FLIS.
3.4. Determining IUID Requirements for Legacy Assets.
   3.4.1. All legacy assets requiring IUID marking shall be annotated in FLIS and D043 with
   an IUID required indicator.
AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014                                                                        11


   3.4.2. Each requiring activity shall provide identified legacy marking stock numbers to the
   AIT PO to coordinate updates to the FLIS and D043 IUID indicators.
   3.4.3. Class II IUID asset population shall be based on AF requirements for serialized
   accountability on the Joint Service General Purpose Mask (M50) and Individual Body Armor
   (IBA) small arm protective inserts.
   3.4.4. Class V asset population targets shall be developed in conjunction with direction from
   HQ USAF functionals to identify the NSN population.
   3.4.5. Class VII IUID legacy asset marking will adhere to requirements as outlined in AFI
   23-101.
   3.4.6. Class VIII asset populations’ targets shall be developed in conjunction with direction
   from HQ USAF functionals to identify the NSN population.
3.5. Legacy Class IX Marking IUID Requirements
   3.5.1. Legacy Class IX IUID asset population shall be based on AF reparable assets that
   meet all of the following criteria:
      3.5.1.1. Depot Level Reparable assets with a positive FLIS or D043 IUID indicator.
      3.5.1.2. Depot Level Reparable assets with an active buy or repair requirement for the
      previous two years, or with a buy or repair requirement that is projected for the next three
      years.
      3.5.1.3. Depot Level Reparable assets with a Source of Supply/Source of Repair of an
      AF depot.
3.6. Item Marking and Registration Requirements.
   3.6.1. The following are general business rules applicable to the assignment of UIIs to items,
   the physical marking of UIIs on items, and registration of UIIs along with the associated
   pedigree data.
      3.6.1.1. Only one (1) UII will be assigned to each discreet asset and registered in the
      DoD IUID Registry. The assigned UII must remain with the asset for the life cycle of the
      asset.
      3.6.1.2. UIIs will be assigned, as much as practical, and physically marked on items
      qualifying for IUID implementation in the possession of the AF for items owned by the
      Air Force or leased through a capital lease. Reference DoD Instruction 5000.64 for
      criteria to determine if a lease is a capital lease.
      3.6.1.3. To the greatest extent possible, PMs and IMs will ensure items are marked with
      UIIs before they are issued to field-level units.
      3.6.1.4. When a physical mark is not feasible, a virtual UII must be assigned (see
      paragraph 3.8 for virtual marking guidelines).
          3.6.1.4.1. The owning organization of an asset registered with a virtual UII and in the
          possession of another organization, shall verify and physically mark the UII upon its
          return.
 12                                                              AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014


          3.6.1.4.2. Before assigning a UII to a qualifying item without a visible data matrix
          symbol marked on it, the entity must verify that a UII has not already been assigned
          using                the             DoD                 IUID               Registry
          (https://iuid.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/ControlledLogin.aspx).
      3.6.1.5. Marking schemas may include imprinting, or other distinguishable marks that do
      not affect form, fit, or function and should be reflected in applicable technical
      documentation as outlined in paragraph 3.7.5. of this document.
      3.6.1.6. If an item is found to have been previously assigned a UII, the item in question
      should be re-marked with the previously assigned UII using the ECC200 data matrix.
      3.6.1.7. For all items meeting IUID criteria, but without an assigned serial number,
      logistics organizations will assign a serial number using the procedures found in section
      5.6.4.3.3 of the AFMAN 23-122.
      3.6.1.8. In accordance with guidance outlined within AFI 63-101/20-101, the PM, with
      support from the PSM, shall plan for and implement IUID using the template and
      guidance in AFPAM 63-128 and in collaboration with the AFMC AIT PO.
          3.6.1.8.1. PMs may coordinate updated implementation plans through the AIT PO
          via the SOCCER process for plans and must include a summary of changes for the
          review by the AIT PO.
      3.6.1.9. Separate IUID implementation plans are not required for sustainment activities
      marking legacy assets. Sustainment activities Work Center/Cost Center supervisors for
      legacy assets shall incorporate planning, programming, budgeting, and execution of IUID
      implementation requirements for legacy assets into day-to-day workload planning and
      scheduling. This includes registration in the DoD IUID registry.
      3.6.1.10. Critical Safety Item (CSI) serialization and marking requirements shall be
      defined on the drawing or elsewhere in the Technical Data Package as outlined in
      paragraph 3.7.5. of this document.
3.7. Engineering Requirements.
   3.7.1. Chief Engineers will:
      3.7.1.1. Consider all appropriate elements of the OSS&E of a part when making
      decisions on IUID markings (AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management)
      such as fatigue, life and operating environment.
      3.7.1.2. Be the final decision authority concerning whether applying an IUID constitutes
      a Class I engineering change for the weapon system (ref. MIL-HDBK-61A,
      Configuration Management Guidance).
      3.7.1.3. Be the decision authority concerning whether the method of adding a UII to a
      current in-use legacy item/part requires additional technical documentation and additional
      engineering involvement.
      3.7.1.4. Define criteria for weapons systems to identify whether the IUID Engineering
      Order (EO) is considered a Class I or Class II (e.g., a Chief Engineer may define IUID
      EOs as Class II unless direct part marked is a CSIs). This definition shall be included in
      the system’s Systems Engineering Plan or equivalent document.
AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014                                                                            13


     3.7.1.5. Consider methods to ensure readability of the mark during normal operational
     use (reference MIL-STD-130N, DoD Standard Practice Identification marking of U.S.
     Military Property). Placement of the mark strongly influences its durability and
     usefulness.
  3.7.1.6. Manage the following items that meet IUID marking criteria for a Class I
  engineering change, and update all required technical documentation as required.
     3.7.1.7. Items on the Critical Safety Item (CSI) list without an existing data plate/label.
  3.7.2. NWRM items.
     3.7.2.1. Assets on the Nuclear Certified Equipment list or Nuclear Certified Item List
     that are not considered common support equipment and are managed by either the ICBM
     or a Cruise missile program office.
  3.7.3. IUID markings shall:
     3.7.3.1. Remain readable throughout the items’ normal life cycle. For depot repairable
     parts, this normal life cycle can be further defined to mean “remain readable through a
     normal operational usage cycle”.
     3.7.3.2. Withstand all environmental conditions that the item will be exposed to under
     normal operation conditions.
     3.7.3.3. Provide no detrimental effects on the functional performance, reliability, or
     durability of the item.
  3.7.4. Requirements for Engineering Order IUID EO drawings, for which the USAF is the
  Current Design Activity (CDA), shall be issued IAW USAF configuration control
  requirements of the program office. These changes shall be considered a formal component
  of the drawing package as soon as they are approved and appropriate organizations (e.g., the
  appropriate JEDMICS organization or contracted data repository) are notified; however, the
  USAF will not ordinarily revise a drawing simply to include IUID.
     3.7.4.1. The EOs shall be incorporated into the drawing with the next drawing revision.
     3.7.4.2. The marking location and characteristics for IUID marking shall be included in
     an EO and/or drawing revision (unless the drawing already includes IUID) for drawings
     for which both of the following is true: the USAF is the CDA, and the drawing describes
     parts which meet the requirements for IUID marking.
     3.7.4.3. If the USAF is not the CDA, then the EO shall be issued as an Advance
     Engineering Supplemental Order (AESO) and not incorporated directly into the drawing
     but will accompany that drawing until the CDA decides to formally incorporate that
     change into the drawing. IUID EOs do not apply to DOE-designed materiel drawings.
  3.7.5. Requirements for Technical Documentation.
     3.7.5.1. Technical Orders (TOs) shall define the mark application method, the processes
     required to correctly apply the mark (including surface preparation), the marking
     location, and mark verification (readability and info). This information shall be consistent
     with USAF TO policies. Note: Technical Orders shall reflect (but not replace) the intent
     of engineering data.
14                                                               AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014


     3.7.5.2. TOs or drawings must incorporate IUID markings requirements, both for legacy
     parts/items and any future procurement when the marking method differs. This
     requirement applies even if new procurement is made using a legacy design.
     3.7.5.3. If a marking process exists in multiple TOs (e.g., one for cleaning procedures,
     one for application procedures, and one for mark location) the Process Order may be used
     to consolidate this information into one format for depot mechanics.
     3.7.5.4. Process Orders shall describe the use of site-specific marking equipment (e.g.,
     the dial settings on a laser marking cart required to achieve TO-specified power and
     exposure levels for a particular part).
     3.7.5.5. All Reparable assets (Class IX) that require IUID marking and where the Air
     Force is the Current Design Authority (CDA), engineering data and technical orders shall
     be revised.
     3.7.5.6. If the USAF is not the CDA and engineering data and technical orders are
     required for marking, then the development of a drawing revision (and/or other
     engineering source data) incorporating the IUID AESO shall only be performed by the
     vendor (typically Original Equipment Manufacturer, (OEM)) who is the CDA. Note that
     these agreements are typically specific to each program office; therefore, each
     program office is responsible for managing this effort, securing the appropriate
     funding, negotiating technical differences in the selection of marking techniques and
     locations, and setting schedules which meet the program office’s needs.
     3.7.5.7. If items cannot be physically marked or tagged due to a lack of marking space or
     because marking or tagging would have a deleterious effect on the item, then the marking
     method shall be in accordance with MIL-STD-130N “Bagged or Tagged” procedures.
     The “Bagged or Tagged” marking procedure does not drive additional technical data
     updates or technical order changes.
  3.7.6. Technical Order Changes.
     3.7.6.1. If an engineering data change is processed to include IUID on a component,
     subcomponent, assembly, or sub-assembly, and if a TO exists which specifies the
     overhaul, remanufacture, repair (or assembly) of that part, the TO shall be updated to
     specify the processes and location for marking the item by IUID.
     3.7.6.2. In the preceding paragraph, the IUID marking method shall (in detail or by
     reference to other TOs) include all inspection procedures, part surface preparation
     procedures, all marking application procedures, and (unless marked with direct part
     marking) the data label, data plate, or IUID label part number (e.g., 200945085-XXX).
     3.7.6.3. The marking location specified in the TO shall be specific to the part and shall
     include sufficient detail to reflect the location and tolerances specified in the EO. In the
     case of multiple parts with the same configuration (e.g., multiple avionics boxes with the
     same top level assembly), a common figure with multiple references may be used.
     3.7.6.4. Program offices may delay the IUID updates to TOs that are not intended for
     AFMC depot use. This planned delay requires the program office to provide a detailed
     timeline for updates to all impacted TOs, the correlation of the updates with planned
     marking processes by non-AFMC personnel (e.g., by TCTO or by intermediate repair
AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014                                                                          15


       facilities), and a schedule to update the TOs no later than the end of FY20. Independent
       of the details of that phased plan, the TO shall be updated after repeated (no more than
       three) requests are received from maintenance for technical assistance to mark the part(s)
       for which non-depot repair procedures exist in that TO.
       3.7.6.5. If the Illustrated Parts Breakdown (IPB) is contained in a separate -4 (i.e., not in
       the repair manual), the IPB is not to be used to specify the location or the method for
       marking a part with IUID. If applying IUID to a part changes a part number in the IPB
       (e.g., if a new data plate is specified which differs from the existing data plate called out
       in the IPB), the IPB shall be updated to show IUID; otherwise, the IPB does not require
       an update to show IUID label location or part number. The nuclear enterprise will adhere
       to NWC IPB requirements.
       3.7.6.6. TO updates that are required because of IUID shall be implemented IAW
       standard TO 00-5-1 and TO 00-5-3 procedures, except as noted below:
       3.7.6.7. Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs) may be used to specify marking
       procedures on legacy parts when determined appropriate by the program office and Chief
       Engineer. If the TCTO is a routine TCTO, it should give full instructions for marking
       and should include appropriate figures. IUID marking should be considered for inclusion
       in a TCTO when inclusion of IUID will assist with TCTO tracking or when it is required
       for the next higher assembly.
       3.7.6.8. IUID Engineering Requirements for Engineering Orders (EOs) and Drawing
       Changes for legacy equipment/end-items. NOTE: This does not include Class IX items
       3.7.6.9. Engineering change requests and drawing revisions shall not be required when
       affixing labels with IUID markings to legacy equipment/principle items if the label does
       not impact characteristics necessary to ensure operational safety, suitability, and
       effectiveness.
       3.7.6.10. If sufficient space exists on the OEM or Air Force manufactured data plate, an
       IUID label or 2D data matrix may be applied if it does not obstruct existing information
       on the data plate. The IUID label or 2D data matrix may be applied IAW methods
       outlined in MIL-STD- 130N.
       3.7.6.11. Equipment specialists should elevate any decision to Program Management for
       IUID placement when the item has no surface area that meets the requirements of MIL-
       STD-130N.
       3.7.6.12. Retrofitted IUID 2D matrices on a legacy item must be able to withstand
       normal operating conditions of the item when in use and for the expected duration of time
       between scheduled maintenance activities.
       3.7.6.13. AFNWC Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division (NCL) will determine the need
       for changes and take necessary action for TOs for DOE-designed materiel within the
       Joint Nuclear Weapons Publication System (JNWPS).
3.8. Use of Virtual UIIs.
   3.8.1. Virtual UIIs are not authorized as a substitute for physical marking when physical
   marking is feasible unless authorized by applicable DoD policy and MIL-STD-130N
   direction.
 16                                                              AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014


   3.8.2. Virtual UIIs may be used to register government furnished equipment if authorized by
   applicable DoD policy.
   3.8.3. Virtual UIIs may be used to register Class VII military equipment that has not already
   been registered if authorized by applicable DoD policy.
   3.8.4. The use of virtual UIIs requires documented traceability between the specific part and
   the assigned virtual UII.
3.9. New Procurement Items.
   3.9.1. For acquisition contracts procuring a new weapon system or incremental modification
   to current weapon systems, the Program Manager will implement IUID requirements in
   support of SIM in accordance with direction contained in AFI 63-101/20-101.
   3.9.2. Program Managers will work with Item Managers (IM) and Equipment Specialists
   (ES) to ensure that acquisition contracts include IUID when required by the program IUID
   implementation plans and/or the IUID indicator in FLIS or D043.
   3.9.3. For acquisition of spares, the procuring activity will implement IUID requirements in
   support of SIM.
   3.9.4. In accordance with applicable DoD policy, the contractor shall submit Unique Item
   Identifiers (UIIs), or other DoD recognized unique identification equivalents, and to provide
   the IUID data for items that are delivered to the Department under a DoD contract.
   3.9.5. For all new acquisitions, Data Item Descriptions (DIDs) (DI-MGMT-81804 and DI-
   MGMT-81803) shall be identified within each contract to hold contractors accountable for
   IUID marking and activities and verification of data, according to MIL-STD-130N.
   3.9.6. All acquisition Statements of Work must contain Data Item Description language that
   explains the responsibilities of the contractor as it relates to IUID and MIL-STD-130N.
   3.9.7. Any asset that is marked as part of an acquisition event (to include spares
   procurement) must be registered in the DoD IUID Registry via Wide Area Work Flow
   (WAWF).
   3.9.8. If IUID is required in the contract, the vendor has not completed their contract
   requirements until the vendor registers the IUID data in WAWF.
3.10. Government Furnished Property (GFP) and Government Furnished Equipment
(GFE).
   3.10.1. In accordance with applicable DFARS policy, the custodial contractor shall report
   UIIs or other DoD recognized unique identification equivalents for all GFP that meets IUID
   policy criteria.
   3.10.2. In addition to mandatory GFP data submissions, submission of other GFP data to the
   DoD IUID Registry is encouraged for contracts with GFP awarded.
   3.10.3. Program and item managers shall apply IUID policy to existing personal property in
   inventory and operational use, including items manufactured by organic DoD depots. They
   must also record the IUID data in the DoD IUID Registry for those items that meet the
   criteria for IUID.
AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014                                                                          17


   3.10.4. As stated in DoD Instruction 8320.04, IUID requirements apply to defense security
   cooperation agreements, otherwise known as foreign military sales (FMS). Use direction
   contained in Paragraph 3.6 (of this Instruction) and its subsections to implement IUID to
   contracts providing acquisition, procurement and/or logistics support to cases.
3.11. Intensive Item Management.
   3.11.1. Based on approved technical data and engineering analysis, Nuclear Weapons
   Related Material (NWRM) will be marked with a UII IAW DoDI 8320.04, Item Unique
   Identification (IUID) Standards for Tangible Personal Property; AFI 63-101/20-101,
   Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management and Methods and Procedures
   Technical Order (MPTO) TO 00-25-260, Asset Marking and Tracking Item Unique
   Identification (IUID) Marking Procedures.
   3.11.2. IAW AFI 20-110, based on approved technical data and engineering analysis,
   NWRM must be marked with a UII IAW DoDI 8320.04, Item Unique Identification (IUID)
   Standards for Tangible Personal Property; AFI 63-101/20-101, Acquisition and Sustainment
   Life Cycle Management and Methods and Procedures Technical Order (MPTO) TO 00-25-
   260, Asset Marking and Tracking Item Unique Identification (IUID) Marking Procedures.
3.12. Contract Repair – Performance Work Statement Guidelines.
   3.12.1. The Performance Work Statement (PWS) shall include specification requirements for
   IUID marking. These will be contained in the applicable Air Force/OEM technical order,
   Specific Work Requirements appendix, approved engineering drawing, or a Government
   provided Engineering order as applicable. PWSs for DOE-designed materiel undergoing
   repair may exclude contractors from IUID requirements. Implementation shall be
   determined by the Program Manager once item(s) are re-delivered to the USAF.
   3.12.2. For items that do not have IUID marking specifications, the PWS shall have
   requirements for the contractor to develop the marking specifications in accordance with the
   latest version of MIL-STD-130N.
   3.12.3. IUID markings are required for all end-items and subcomponents to the end-item
   specifically identified in the applicable Air Force/OEM technical order, Specific Work
   Requirements appendix, approved engineering drawing, or a Government provided
   Engineering order.
   3.12.4. IUID markings currently in place on items undergoing repair shall be protected from
   damage or removal during repair. Ensure 2-D matrix IUID markings are readable per TO 00-
   25-260. Should IUID marking be rendered unreadable during repair, the contractor shall
   notify the PCO/ACO for determination.
   3.12.5. IUID markings which will be potentially destroyed during repair due to technical
   direction (i.e. paint removal, sand blasting, etc.) shall be recorded prior to maintenance action
   and replaced with the same UII as part of the repair action.
   3.12.6. The contractor shall submit the required and applicable data for legacy items to the
   DoD      IUID      Registry      per     the     data     submission       procedures     at
   http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/uid/data_submission_information.html.
 18                                                                 AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014


3.13. IUID Lifecycle Events Reporting.
   3.13.1. An appropriate lifecycle event transaction will be sent to the DoD IUID Registry
   when a uniquely identified item is abandoned, consumed, destroyed by accident or combat
   operations, donated, expended, scrapped, sold, or stolen (see the full list of lifecycle events in
   the IUID Registry User Guide). As part of their functional responsibilities, item managers
   will initiate actions resulting in AIS processing and transmitting these lifecycle event
   transactions.
3.14. Use of Item Markings to Enhance SIM.
   3.14.1. To the greatest extent practicable, manual data entry will not be used to enter item
   identification information into AFMC logistics information systems.
   3.14.2. AIT will be used to scan and create logistics supply chain event transactions
   associated with individual items using the UII encoded into the data matrix symbol.
   3.14.3. Logistics supply chain event transactions will be used to populate AFMC logistics
   information systems with the UII as the key data element to which all other data will be
   associated.
   3.14.4. If an item does not have a UII assigned, then the manufacturer’s CAGE code along
   with the part number and serial number assigned by the manufacturer will be used to identify
   an item in logistics information systems.
      3.14.4.1. The key data element for an item without an assigned UII is the manufacturer’s
      serial number. This serial number must be unique with respect to all other instances of
      items assigned the same part and cage numbers.
   3.14.5. Data entered into AFMC logistics information systems shall use the exact alpha-
   numeric characters used by the manufacturer to identify the part number and serial number of
   an item.
   3.14.6. AFMC logistics information systems must be capable of accepting the UII (when
   determined to have an IUID requirement) and/or the exact alpha-numeric characters used by
   manufacturer to identify an item without changing the data in any fashion (e.g. adding or
   removing leading zeros).
   3.14.7. If an item does not have a serial number assigned by the manufacturer, a serial
   number will be assigned and physically marked on the item, using the procedures found in
   section 5.6.4.3.3 of the AFMAN 23-122. The serial number assigned by the AFMC
   organization will be unique with respect to all other instances of items assigned the same part
   and cage numbers.
   3.14.8. Data associated to individual items using the UII will be used to improve materiel
   management practices throughout AFMC.
   3.14.9. UII will enhance Joint Total Asset Visibility (JTAV) by providing unique
   serialization of assets across an increasing number of stock numbers.
   3.14.10. The Air Force initially focused JTAV initiatives on high value (weapon systems,
   vehicles, support equipment) and highly controlled (NWRM) material. Continued UII
   marking of assets and inventory will enable increased control and enhanced visibility of
AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014                                                                            19


  AFMC’s controlled inventory items, repairable items, mission critical assets, classified
  materials, pilferable assets, information technology equipment, and small arms.
  3.14.11. Using AIT to enable JTAV will allow for better asset management throughout the
  AFMC supply chain by ensuring the consistent marking and tracking of all assets.
  3.14.12. IUID enabled SIM will allow AFMC to capture asset related data with minimal or
  no manual data entry.
  3.14.13. Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) can be defined as a set of maintenance
  processes and capabilities derived from real-time assessment of weapon system condition
  obtained from embedded sensors and/or external tests and measurements using portable
  equipment. The goal of CBM is to perform maintenance only upon evidence of need.
     3.14.13.1. CBM+ expands on these basic concepts, encompassing other technologies,
     processes, and procedures that enable improved maintenance and logistics practices.
     These future and existing technologies, processes, and procedures will be addressed
     during the capabilities planning, acquisition, sustainment, and disposal of a weapon
     system.
     3.14.13.2. AIT enabled SIM shall be leveraged to achieve CBT+ Implementation within
     AFMC.
  3.14.14. Increased efficiency and capability will improve PLM through the use of AIT and
  IUID enabled SIM. Efficiencies include reduced manpower costs, increased accuracy, and
  reduced time to prepare documentation for inventories, issue and subsequent cyclic issue/re-
  issue of sensitive items such as weapons. All items meeting the criteria, as stated in MIL-
  STD-130N, shall be marked with a UII.
     3.14.14.1. Using UII for serial item management will result in more timely, accurate,
     reliable and actionable information that can be obtained to improve maintenance and
     materiel management. The benefits derive from harvesting the serial item data through
     IUID and utilizing the data to make PLM programs more effective.
     3.14.14.2. By implementing the necessary management information system changes and
     business process improvements to capture, integrate, and intelligently utilize maintenance
     and operating data recorded primarily through maintenance transactions, AFMC can
     achieve significant reliability, maintainability, and materiel management improvements.
     3.14.14.3. UII will be a key enabler to achieving Office of the Secretary of Defense
     (OSD) Comptroller mandated Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR)
     compliance by 2016. UII will be the Individual Item Identifier data element used to
     support financial statement audits for DoD Mission Critical Assets. Mission Critical
     Assets include Military Equipment (ME) (e.g., ships, aircraft, combat vehicles), Real
     Property (RP) (e.g., land, buildings, structures, utilities), Inventory (e.g., rations, supplies,
     spare parts, fuel), Operation Materials and Supplies (OM&S) (e.g., ammunition,
     munitions, missiles), and Support Equipment(e.g., materiel handling equipment, training
     equipment, special tooling and test equipment). UII will support asset specific acquisition
     cost, depreciated value, and inventory valuation throughout the ‘Acquire to Retire’ asset
     lifecycle management process, which is required to satisfy financial auditing
     requirements.
20                                                              AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014


  3.14.15. DoD IUID Registry will impact efforts to implement FIAR plan and achieve CFO
  compliance.
     3.14.15.1. DoD Instruction 8320.04 establishes the DoD IUID Registry as the
     authoritative source of Government unit acquisition cost for items with UII acquired after
     January 1, 2004, and for UII pedigree data established at delivery as defined by the
     DFARS 252.211-7003.
     3.14.15.2. AFMC IT systems that identify acquisition cost for uniquely identified items
     procured on/after 1 January 2004 must correspond to data contained within DoD IUID
     Registry.
     3.14.15.3. FIAR Guidance states UIIs will be used to associate physical asset to data
     records in accountable property system of records for military equipment, general
     equipment, serially managed inventory, and serially managed operating materials &
     supplies.
     3.14.15.4. To effectively support SIM and FIAR, systems that identify transactions to
     individual assets via an asset identifier need to be modernized to accommodate UIIs.
  3.14.16. UII will enable Warranty Tracking for assets procured from, and repaired by,
  commercial suppliers. Uniquely identifying warranted assets will allow item managers and
  maintenance personnel to identify items covered by warranty preventing unnecessary organic
  maintenance actions. In addition, assets with a UII can be tracked according to the terms of
  the specific procurement or repair contract to ensure warranties terms are not violated,
  thereby nullifying the supplier warranty. Ensuring warranted items are repaired by the
  responsible supplier in accordance with the terms of the procurement or repair contract will
  reduce organic repair of warranted assets, reduce the overall lifecycle cost to the AFMC for
  those assets, and provide data used to justify the additional costs of a warranty for future
  procurements
     3.14.16.1. Items under warranty must be properly marked as to their warranty status and
     labeled with information necessary to track and administer the warranty on that item.
     Guidance for marking items, including warranted items, is contained in MIL-STD-130N,
     Identification Marking of US Military Property. Warranty marking on unit pack
     containers shall be IAW MIL-STD-129, Military Marking for Shipment and Storage.
     These standards are sufficiently flexible to allow tailoring to individual programs.
     3.14.16.2. For commercial items entering the military distribution system, the Contractor
     is required to mark the packaging in accordance with MIL-STD-129, including any
     warranty marking.
     3.14.16.3. IUID will also assist the Repair Network Integration (RNI) initiative by
     providing detailed pedigree data for items within the maintenance network. IUID data
     capture in the repair network will allow more specific analysis at the item level and allow
     Product Group Managers (PGM) greater visibility of commodity condition information
     based on item type and OEM. The additional data provided by IUID and AIT data
     collection processes would enhance any Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM)
     strategy by providing timely, complete, and accurate item-level data.
AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014                                                                       21


3.15. Warranted asset marking guidelines.
   3.15.1. Item marking requirements in the contract are normally stated in Part I--The
   Schedule while container marking is addressed in Section C—Statement of Work and
   Section D--Packaging and Marking.
   3.15.2. The Contractor is responsible for applying warranty markings.
   3.15.3. Warranted hardware, technical data/drawings, packaging instructions, and software
   shall each be properly identified as warranted items.
   3.15.4. Desired Label Characteristics and Label Locations shall align with the item
   identification requirements in MIL-STD-130N and packaging marking IAW MIL-STD-129.
   3.15.5. SIM, using IUID, will improve weapon system reliability and maintainability by
   providing the capability to uniquely track, monitor, and manage repairable assets across the
   maintenance enterprise. Uniquely identified repairable assets will retain maintenance, repair,
   and configuration histories for each UII allowing item managers, engineers, and maintenance
   personnel to identify ‘bad actor’ assets continually not meeting reliability standards.
   Removing ‘bad actor’ assets from the repairable asset pool, and providing reliable
   replacements, will decrease maintenance removals and asset repair actions thereby increasing
   weapon system reliability and maintenance capacity.
3.16. IUID enabled SIM programs should be designed and operated to optimize end item
availability while minimizing support costs by:
   3.16.1. Providing maintenance technicians and decision maker’s rapid access to
   comprehensive and accurate information.
   3.16.2. Improving the efficiency of maintenance and related processes, e.g., eliminating
   manually-supported paperwork, reducing job times, enhancing maintenance task and
   personnel scheduling, and shrinking inventories.
   3.16.3. Reducing maintenance requirements through better configuration management and
   item/select population life-cycle history information.
   3.16.4. Facilitating tracking of specific item performance to support reliability analysis,
   warranty claims, and repair performance evaluation.
      3.16.4.1. IAW DoDI 4151.19, Military Departments and Defense Agencies shall identify
      populations of select uniquely identified items to track and manage within their
      maintenance SIM programs.
   3.16.5. AFMC should utilize SNT/UID technology through AIT for logistics and for
   improving the efficiency of maintenance and related processes, e.g., eliminating manually-
   supported paperwork, reducing job times, enhancing maintenance task and personnel
   scheduling, and shrinking inventories.
      3.16.5.1. As resources become available, existing maintenance AISs shall be enhanced
      or modified to support the tenets of SIM programs. Effective SIM is a result of each
      service’s management practices.
 22                                                               AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014


   3.16.6. Leveraging IUID enabled SIM is critical to achieve the success of High Velocity
   Maintenance (HVM) solution to significantly accelerate the speed and effectiveness of depot
   maintenance activities. The result is improved availability and higher quality repair.
   3.16.7. IUID will increase Inventory Accuracy for all AFMC assets by providing a unique
   reference identifier for each asset processed during shipment, issue, and receipt. Transacting
   assets using both the stock number and UII data elements will decrease the number of
   discrepant materiel management transactions by forcing materiel management personnel to
   validate the UII for each item in the transaction. Unlike serial numbers, UIIs will be unique
   across the AFMC, eliminating the possibility of shipping, issuing, or receiving a serialized
   asset under an incorrect stock number. (Ref. MIL-STD-129 – Military Marking for Shipment
   and Storage)
   3.16.8. UIIs will provide the unique serial number data element required by future state
   AFMC logistics systems. Ensuring the UII is unique in the legacy system environment will
   facilitate data conversion during system modernization and/or replacement and reduce data
   cleansing/preparation activities.
3.17. Marking Waiver Process.
   3.17.1. For Class VII items that cannot be marked, waiver requests must meet the exception
   criteria and routed through the respective command. Ultimately, the request will flow
   through to the AIT PO at AFMC.
      3.17.1.1. For all other classes of supply, a waiver request must be submitted directly to
      the AIT PO. The AIT PO will work with the Program Manager to manage each request.
      See Attachment 5 for an example marking waiver request.
      3.17.1.2. Physical application of the UII will follow MIL-STD-130N, Identification
      Marking of U.S. Military Property.
      3.17.1.3. Where engineering analysis determines physical application of a UII would
      destroy the form, fit, or function of an item, an alternate method to uniquely identify the
      item will be used (see section 3.8 for the use of virtual marking methods).
      3.17.1.4. If a program office identifies an IUID engineering strategy which assures
      OSS&E and reduces costs, the program office may submit to HQ AFMC/A4 a waiver to
      the paragraph(s) which would otherwise prohibit that strategy; however, the waiver
      request shall include a documented engineering plan and lifecycle cost-benefit-analysis
      compared to the use of the guidance as written.

 26                                                                 AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014


Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Code— A five (5) position alphanumeric code
with a numeric value in the first and last positions, excluding the letters I and O assigned to U.S.
organizations which manufacture and/or control the design of items supplied to a Government
Military or Civil Agency or assigned to U.S. organizations, primarily for identifying contractors
in the mechanical interchange of data required by MILSCAP and Service/Agency automatic data
processing systems. The CAGE code is a type of Enterprise Identifier. (Ref. MIL-STD 130 or
DoD 4100.39-M Volume 7)
Controlled Inventory—Those items that are designated as having characteristics that require
that they be identified, accounted for, segregated or handled in a special manner to ensure their
protection and integrity. Controlled inventory stock includes classified, sensitive or pilferable
items. Information is extracted from DOD Guide to Uniquely Identifying Items Assuring
Valuation, Accountability and Control of Government Property.
Design— A complete definition of the physical (and functional) characteristics of a component
or series of components.
DOD IUID Registry— UIIs are stored in comprehensive IUID registry, which allows easy
access to information such as acquisition cost and life-cycle data. The IUID registry is
maintained by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS). The IUID registry of items
marked with UIIs provides accurate and accessible unique identification and pedigree
information about these items. This information is used to make acquisition, repair and
deployment of items faster and more efficient.
Enterprise Identifier— A unique identifier used to distinguish one activity or organization from
another activity or organization. An enterprise identifier code is uniquely assigned to an activity
by an issuing agency registered in accordance with procedures outlined in ISO/IEC 15459-2. An
enterprise may be an entity such as a design activity, manufacturer, supplier, depot, and program
management office or a third party.
Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)— Property that is acquired directly by the
government and then made available to the contractor for use.
Government Furnished Property (GFP)— Property in the possession of, or directly acquired
by, the Government and subsequently furnished to the contractor for performance of a contract.
Government furnished property includes, but is not limited to, spares and property furnished for

contractor acquired property if the contractor-acquired property is a deliverable under a cost
contract when accepted by the Government for continued use under the contract.
Issuing Agency— An organization responsible for assigning a non-repeatable identifier to an
enterprise [i.e., Dun & Bradstreet's Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number,
Uniform Code Council (UCC)/EAN International (EAN) Company Prefix or Allied Committee
135 CAGE Code].
Item— A single hardware article or a single unit formed by a grouping of subassemblies,
components, or constituent parts. (Ref. DFARS 252.211-7007 or MIL-STD-130N)
Item Unique Identification (IUID)— A system of marking and valuing items delivered to the
DoD that will enhance logistics, contracting, and financial business transactions supporting the
United States and coalition troops. (Ref. DFARS 252.211-7007)

IUID Equivalent— Unique identification methods in commercial use have been recognized by
DoD as IUID equivalents (Ref. MIL-STD-130N):
Legacy Items—Items which are owned by the USAF that qualify for IUID implementation, but
have not been assigned and/or marked with a UII, and have not been entered into the DoD IUID
Registry. Legacy items may be of any condition code (e.g., serviceable, reparable, engineering
evaluation).
Legacy Part— Any part which is described by a legacy design, for which at least one item
(instance of the part) is already owned by the USAF, and which meets the DoD IUID marking
criteria. The term “legacy part” is inclusive of all parts which meet this definition, regardless of
the parts’ repair/overhaul/condemnation or other support strategy.
Mission Essential— Resources that directly bear on the functions, initiatives, and operations of
Air Force agencies that personnel must have on hand to carry out the installation mission
effectively.
Non—Recurring Engineering—Refers to the one-time cost to research, develop, design and
test a new product.
Part— One item, or two or more items joined together, that is not normally subject to
disassembly without destruction or impairment of designed use (e.g., transistor, composition
resistor, screw, transformer, and gear). (Ref. MIL-STD-130Nor ASME Y14.100).
Part or identifying number (PIN or P/N)—The identifier assigned by the original design
activity, or by the controlling nationally recognized standard, that uniquely identifies (relative to
that design activity) a specific item. (Ref. MIL-STD-130N or ASME Y14.100).
Program Manager—Designated individual with responsibility for and authority to accomplish
program objectives for development, production, and sustainment to meet the user’s operational
needs.
Serial Number (S/N)— An assigned designation that provides a means of identifying a specific
individual item. (Ref. MIL-STD-130N)
Serially Managed—An item used and designated by DOD or an IM to be uniquely tracked,
controlled or managed in maintenance, repair and/or supply by means of its serial number. The
management of uniquely identified reparable assets, selected consumables, engines, equipment
and other designated property. Includes items such as reparable assets down to and including
sub-component reparable unit level; life-limited, time-controlled or items requiring records (e.g.,
logbooks, aeronautical equipment service records, etc.); and items that require technical directive
tracking at the part level
Tangible Personal Property—Property characterized by a physical presence and the ability to
be moved as opposed to intangible personal property such as data, software or patents and real
property such as land, buildings, and fixtures attached to buildings.
Unique Item Identifier (UII)—A globally unique and unambiguous identifier that distinguishes
an item from all other like and unlike items. The UII is a concatenated value that is derived from
a UII data set of one or more data elements. (Ref. MIL-STD-130N)
UII Data Set—A set of one or more data elements marked on an item from which the
concatenated UII can be derived. The UII types, limited to 50 characters, are as follows:
 28                                                               AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014

                STANDARDIZATION OF USAF IUID DATA MATRICES

A2.1. Intent. Standardization of AFMC IUID Data Matrices is required to meet Office of the
Secretary of Defense (OSD) guidance, to guarantee uniqueness of each UII, and to expedite
marking processes.
A2.2. Serialization. An item’s serial number is intended to uniquely identify the item as
different from any other item in inventory. As defined below, AFMC will only use two serial
number schemes (reference “Department of Defense Guide to Uniquely Identifying Items:
Assuring Valuation, Accountability and Control of Government Property, Version 2.0, October
1, 2008”).
   A2.2.1. Part-Based Serial Numbers: Prior to IUID, serial numbers were only unique when
   associated with a part number. Within AFMC, the Part S/N generally will not change as the
   part undergoes configuration changes; however, it may need to be modified if it is found not
   to be unique, or if multiple parts of different configurations are modified to a new common
   configuration part.
   A2.2.2. Construct #1 Serial Numbers: The serial number used in Construct #1 is guaranteed
   unique when used in conjunction with the Enterprise Identifier (EID) of the marking activity.
   The resulting concatenated number has the advantages of being independent of P/N changes
   and independent of duplications in prior serialization. Note: Any item with a part-based S/N
   (typically that assigned by the OEM during manufacturing) will retain that part-based S/N
   after the assigning of a Construct #1 UII. The two will be related through the Air Force Serial
   Number Tracking Metrics Analysis Tool (SNT MAT) and the DoD IUID Registry.
A2.3. Requirement. The following specify the required IUID data matrix formats:
   A2.3.1. Re-Marking: Re-marking refers to the application of a replacement label or direct
   mark with the 2D matrix encoding the UII previously assigned to the item. Situations where a
   replacement label or direct mark might be required include, but are not limited to, the
   original data matrix containing the UII has become unreadable or been removed. Any re-
   marking shall begin with a revalidation of the uniqueness of the original UII and of the
   association of that UII with the item to be re-marked. Any re-marking of existing items
   which were previously marked (with a UII recorded in the DoD IUID Registry) shall be re-
   marked with the same UII to maintain continuity of the record. The data identifier 25S shall
   be used for the syntax of the replacement label or direct mark. Lifecycle trending and
   tracking of each item requires that each UII be permanently assigned to an item and that the
   UII-item one-to-one relationship never be broken.
   A2.3.2. Marking of Legacy Items: The Construct #1 (18S) data identifier from international
   standard (ISO15418) will be used to create all new UIIs (as of the date of this publication)
   applied to AFMC-marked (e.g., organically marked) legacy items.
       A2.3.2.1. The following legacy items will not be marked with Construct #1:
          A2.3.2.1.1. Re-Marking of items which were not previously marked with Construct
          #1, except for the 25S construct.
AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014                                                                       29


         A2.3.2.1.2. If a part’s IUID engineering instructions are controlled by a vendor
         (OEM) drawing which specifies a data identifier other than 18S, then the items of that
         part shall be assigned a UII according to that drawing. However, this case only
         applies if all of the following three conditions are true: (a) the USAF did not fund the
         drawing modification which specified IUID implementation; (b) the USAF has a
         written agreement with the vendor that explicitly states that the vendor accepts
         responsibility for the uniqueness of UIIs created by the USAF under the agreement,
         that specifies the part numbers covered in the agreement, and in which the vendor
         explicitly allows the USAF to use the vendor’s enterprise identifier in the marking of
         those parts; and (c) the USAF and the vendor have an established method to prevent
         the potential duplication of marks. Program offices may submit to HQ AFMC/A4
         waiver requests for designs completed prior to the publication of this guidance.
     A2.3.2.2. The USAF organization marking the part is typically the organization
     responsible for assuring the uniqueness of the concatenated Construct #1 UII. Under
     some circumstances (e.g., nuclear related items), the organization guaranteeing
     uniqueness of the concatenated Construct #1 UII may be a different organization; in those
     cases, each organization involved must establish appropriate operating procedures. All
     organizations guaranteeing the uniqueness of concatenated Construct #1 UIIs shall use
     the AFMC-wide IUID information technology system to do so once that system is
     available.
     A2.3.2.3. US Air Force ordinance shall comply with the IUID format selected by the
     Joint Ordinance Commander’s Group.
  A2.3.3. Marking of Non-Legacy Items: All new items which meet the criteria for IUID
  marking shall be marked using the UII format specified in the design for that part, by the
  contract (if the new part is being made by a commercial entity), or by the guidance of the
  producing service (if the new part is being made for the USAF by the Army or Navy). Note:
  All newly produced parts will be marked using the enterprise identifier (CAGE) of the
  activity that produced the part, except as described in A2.3.4.3.
     A2.3.3.1. New items produced (manufactured) by the USAF shall be marked using the
     18S data identifier if allowed by the part’s drawing. When the drawing does not allow
     18S and the USAF is the CDA, then an EO shall be made to allow marking with 18S.
     When the drawing does not allow 18S and the USAF is not the CDA, then USAF shall
     mark the item as specified in the controlling drawing; however, the mark must use the
     USAF producing activity’s enterprise identifier. When the drawing does not allow 18S
     and it does not allow the use of the USAF producing activity’s enterprise identifier then
     normal waiver/deviation/EO procedures shall be used to mark the items using the 18S
     data identifier.
     A2.3.3.2. For new parts which are produced by a commercial vendor (except in cases
     described in A3.3.4.3), IUID shall be marked IAW DFARS 252.211-7003, Item
     Identification and Valuation. If any part of this policy is in conflict with DFARS
     252.211-7003, then DFARS 252.211-7003 shall be used in lieu of this guidance. If the
     USAF contracts for a new item and if the vendor identifies a conflict between DFARS
     252.211-7003(c)(4) and the format of the Unique Item Identifier specified in the item’s
30                                                              AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014


     drawing, then it is the responsibility of the USAF Acquisition Team to process EOs,
     AESOs, or waivers/deviations to correct the conflict between these requirements.
     A2.3.3.3. For new parts which are produced by a small business, the USAF procuring
     activity may choose not to require the small business to mark the part (reference DoDI
     8320.04, Item Unique Identification (IUID) Standards for Tangible Personal Property). In
     these cases, the USAF procuring activity shall arrange for the part to be marked within 30
     days of the receipt of the item. The USAF shall mark the item as it would mark a legacy
     item, reference paragraph A2.3.2. A Determination and Finding (D&F) must be
     accomplished prior to any decision concerning marking these parts.
AFMCI20-104 5 JUNE 2014                                                                           31

A3.1. Objective
The mission of the AFMC IUID Implementation IPT is to develop AFMC policies and
procedures for Air Force implementation of IUID to ensure the effective and efficient planning
and execution of legacy and new acquisition asset marking and registration. The AFMC IUID
IPT will address major elements of IUID implementation, as well as monitor IUID
implementation activity for legacy and new asset acquisition. Additionally, the IPT will:

Coordinate and collaborate on best practices, processes and plans to assist the centers in
establishing large scale IUID marking and registering of requisite items containing data labels
and plates when processed through organic repair shops and commercial repair facilities.
Identify and address all elements of policy, planning and scheduling, engineering authority,
equipment, training, and information systems that could impact timely implementation.
Address procedures for marking and registration.
Establish a common methodology for tracking and reporting status and compliance metrics for
IUID Scorecard Reviews for depot maintenance marking and registration.

Figure A3.2. Background
A3.2. Background


DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8320.04 implements policy in DoD Directive 8320.03; established the
IUID Registry roles and functions; assigns responsibilities and establishes procedures for
operation and maintenance of the IUID Registry; and establishes the functional framework for
IUID as it relates to these DoD policies.
The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics
(OUSD (AT&L)) has issued guidance that:
Directs a change of date to complete IUID marking and registration of legacy supply class II &
IX items to December 31, 2015.
Reaffirms the December 31, 2010 compliance mandate for qualifying legacy items in all other
supply classes.
Establishes implementation dates for marking and registering data label and data plate items at
organic and commercial repair facilities.
AFMC was directed to address the parts marking mandate, from an Air Force perspective, and to
further address all major elements of IUID implementation for legacy and newly acquired assets.
This direction includes Air Force policy, planning, scheduling, engineering authority, equipment
acquisition, training, and information systems. All items that meet DoDI 8320.04 requirements,
and have a data label or data plate, are directed to be marked and registered when processed
through organic or contracted maintenance depot activities.
