                                               Chapter 1

                                    GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. This Air Force Instruction (AFI) provides policy for operating the KC-10 aircraft. It is an orig-
   inal source document for many areas, but for efficacy, restates information found in aircraft flight
   manuals, flight information publications (FLIP), and other Air Force directives. When guidance in
   this AFI conflicts with another basic/source document, that document takes precedence. For matters
   where this AFI is the source document, waiver authority is In Accordance With (IAW) paragraph 1.4.
   For matters where this AFI repeats information in another document, follow waiver authority outlined
   in the basic/source document.
   1.1.2. Unit commanders and agency directors involved with or supporting KC-10 operations shall
   make current copies of this AFI available to appropriate personnel. Transportation and Base Opera-
   tions passenger manifesting agencies will maintain a current copy of this AFI.

1.2. Applicability. This AFI applies to aircrew members, support personnel, and managers involved with
employing KC-10 aircraft.

1.3. Key Words Explained.
   1.3.1. "Will" and "shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. "Should" indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment.
   1.3.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. "NOTE" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to emphasize.
   1.3.5. “CAUTION” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in damage
   to equipment if not carefully followed.
   1.3.6. “WARNING” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in personal
   injury or loss of life if not carefully followed.

1.4. Deviations and Waivers. Do not deviate from policies in this AFI except when the situation
demands immediate action to ensure safety. The Pilot in Command (PIC) is vested with ultimate mission
authority and is responsible for each course-of-action they choose to take.
   1.4.1. Deviations. The PIC shall report deviations or exceptions taken without a waiver through com-
   mand channels to the Chief, AMC Stan/Eval as appropriate for follow-on action.
   1.4.2. Waivers. Unless otherwise directed, waiver authority for contents of this instruction is the
   MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority. Obtain waivers to deviate from provisions in this
   AFI via HQ AMC Stan/Eval.
   1.4.2. (TRAVIS) The 60th Operations Group Commander (60 OG/CC) is the waiver authority for
   this supplement.
       1.4.2.1. Permanent waivers affect theater unique circumstances and are enduring in nature. List
       MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved permanent waivers in the MAJCOM supplement (see para. 1.5.)
16                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


        1.4.2.2. Long-term waivers affect multiple aircraft/multiple missions but are not permanent in
        nature (expire at a specific date/time). Initiate waivers to deviate from provisions in this AFI with
        HQ AMC Stan/Eval.
        1.4.2.3. Short-notice waivers are for specific missions in execution. PICs shall use the Waiver
        Protocol procedure in Chapter 4 to secure MAJCOM/A3/DO approval for short-notice waivers.

                                               Chapter 2

                                    COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The Mobility Air Forces (MAF) command and control (C2) network consists of the fol-
lowing C2 centers: Eighteenth Air Force Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) Global Cell, Pacific Air
Forces (PACAF) or United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) Air Mobility Operation Control Centers
(AMOCCs), Air National Guard (ANG) Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Com-
mand Center, theater Air and Space Operations Centers (AOC), Air Mobility Division (AMD), Air
Mobility Elements (AME), Joint Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC), Unit Command Posts, Air
Mobility Control Centers (AMCC), Contingency Response Groups (CRG), and Special Tactics Teams
(STT). C2 centers are action agents for the MAF commander with execution authority (operational con-
trol) over mobility missions/forces.

2.2. Execution Authority. Headquarters commanders with command authority over MAF resources
hold execution authority for directed missions. Commanders with execution authority formulate plans,
allocate assets, and approve missions through a local command post or C2 element. OG/CCs serve as exe-
cution authority for local training missions. The pilot in command will execute missions operating outside
normal communication channels (use last known mission orders or best course of action).
   2.2.1. Off-Station Trainer (OST). Refer to AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations, for procedures
   and requirements governing OSTs.
       2.2.1.1. AFRC Current Operations (AFRC/DOOM) is approval authority for AFRC Unit
       Equipped (UE) OSTs.

2.3. Pilot in Command (PIC) Responsibility and Authority. Squadron commanders (SQ/CC) shall
designate an aircraft commander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), or evaluator pilot (EP) as the PIC for all
flights, on a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable supple-
ments. An unqualified or non-mission ready pilot may not be designated as PIC. PICs are:
   2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.3.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only fly events autho-
   rized in the mission tasking unless, in the PIC’s judgment, an emergency condition demands other-
   wise. Fly unscheduled training events (for example, air refueling (AR) or transition training) after
   obtaining approval of the execution authority.
   2.3.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority.
   2.3.4. The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
   2.3.5. Responsible for passing mission progress reports (at least daily) to C2 agents.
   2.3.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel and will
   establish a point-of-contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior to entering crew rest. Local C2
   agents are responsible for coordinating mission support requirements on the PIC’s behalf.
   2.3.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Ground Personnel
   (MEGP), passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
18                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The execution authority and PIC shall make the mission clearance
decision. In all cases, final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the PIC. If a PIC
elects to delay a mission, that mission will not depart until the conditions that generated the decision to
delay improve or are resolved. Further, no execution authority may task another PIC to take the same mis-
sion under the same conditions.
     2.4.1. Only re-route or divert a mission when authorized by the execution authority, to resolve an
     emergency, or if required by en route or terminal weather conditions.
     2.4.2. The agent that directed the re-route or divert shall ensure the aircraft is capable of executing
     departure, en route, and destination arrival procedures.
     2.4.3. The PIC will notify the appropriate C2 agent of any aircraft or aircrew limitation that may pre-
     clude re-route or divert.
     2.4.4. When a C2 agent directs a PIC to fly to an alternate airfield, the agent will ensure existing and
     forecast weather for the alternate, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), and airfield information from the
     Global Decision Support System (GDSS)/GDSS2/Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report
     (ASRR), is suitable. If the alternate becomes unsuitable while en route, coordinate with the C2 agent
     for other suitable alternates. The PIC is final authority for accepting a suitable alternate. A C2 agent
     will alert customs and all appropriate ground service agencies to prepare for arrival.

2.5. Operational C2 Reporting.
     2.5.1. Stations With MAF C2 Agency. Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data (arrival, depar-
     ture, and advisory messages) in the MAF C2 system. If local C2 agents are unable, they will notify the
     PIC for assistance.
     2.5.2. Stations Without MAF C2 Agency. Transmit mission data to the controlling C2 agency by any
     means available (i.e., DSN, HF, iridium phone, and L-Band SATCOM, etc.). HF Radio is the primary
     method of communication for routine mission information. For critical C2 communications, i.e. air-
     craft waiver request, maintenance delay, etc., voice communications are the primary method with
     L-Band SATCOM as the backup.
     2.5.3. Enroute Reporting.
        2.5.3.1. Make the following enroute calls to TACC, as required:
            2.5.3.1.1. Airborne call when departing from a location without an AMC presence.
            2.5.3.1.2. Maintenance call whenever aircraft alpha status changes to code 3.
            2.5.3.1.3. On aeromedical evacuation missions, no later than 1 hour prior to landing, to update
            arrival time.
        2.5.3.2. CONUS. Periodic “ops normal” calls/transmissions are not required; however, the con-
        trolling C2 agency may increase reporting requirements.
        2.5.3.3. OCONUS. MAJCOM C2 agencies will specify increased reporting procedures through a
        communications plan in the OPLAN, OPORD, FRAG, Mission Directive, or FLIP. Aircrews will
        maintain listening watch in accordance with the communications plan within aircraft equipment
        capabilities (e.g. HF-Automatic Link Establishment (HF-ALE), L-Band SATCOM).
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                19


  2.5.4. Aircraft Status/Maintenance Discrepancy Reporting. PICs shall report aircraft system malfunc-
  tions that traditionally require extensive trouble shooting as soon as feasible. Contact arrival C2
  agency if available, otherwise contact MAJCOM C2 for relay.
  2.5.5. Air Refueling Mission Reports.
     2.5.5.1. Tanker AR Report. On operational missions, pilots will provide the following informa-
     tion after a tanker AR to MAJCOM C2. Under normal circumstances, send only one off-load mes-
     sage, completed after the final AR for the mission. Under abnormal circumstances such as receiver
     diverts, unsuccessful AR, insufficient off-load, or anything else that impacts the overall success of
     the mission, send a report as soon as practical.
         2.5.5.1.1. Call Sign.
         2.5.5.1.2. Fuel off-loaded.
         2.5.5.1.3. Mission status.
         2.5.5.1.4. Next station.
         2.5.5.1.5. Estimated time of arrival (ETA).
     2.5.5.2. Receiver AR Report. On operational missions, report the following AR information to
     the destination C2 agency after landing. C2 agencies will enter the information in the MAF C2
     system for missions under their control. The MAJCOM C2 agency will enter the data for all mis-
     sions. Include all scheduled ARs not accomplished.
         2.5.5.2.1. AR track.
         2.5.5.2.2. Scheduled On-load.
         2.5.5.2.3. Actual Onload.
         2.5.5.2.4. Reason Code.
         2.5.5.2.5. Additional Comments.
     2.5.5.3. Reason Codes. Reason codes indicate the outcome of air refueling activity. Codes are
     normally used when a problem or situation affects the successful accomplishment of the air refu-
     eling. The Reason Code “AC” will be used when air refueling was complete without delay or mis-
     sion impact. Additional comments are mandatory for all reason codes except AT, WX, and AC.
         2.5.5.3.1. RO-Receiver Operations.
         2.5.5.3.2. RM-Receiver Maintenance.
         2.5.5.3.3. RW-Receiver Weather.
         2.5.5.3.4. TO-Tanker Operations.
         2.5.5.3.5. TM-Tanker Maintenance.
         2.5.5.3.6. TW-Tanker Weather.
         2.5.5.3.7. AT-Air Traffic Control.
         2.5.5.3.8. WX-Air Refueling Track Adverse Weather.
         2.5.5.3.9. AC-Air Refueling Complete.

     2.5.6. “Thirty Minute” Out Call. Transmit a UHF or VHF arrival advisory to the destination C2
     agency approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. Provide Estimated Time in Blocks (ETB).
     2.5.7. Integrated Flight Management (IFM) Sorties. On IFM sorties the flight managers (FM) will be
     the C2 conduit for aviators. For critical C2 communications, voice communications (HF, DSN, irid-
     ium phone, etc.) are the primary method.
        2.5.7.1. Position Reporting on IFM Missions. IFM missions transiting oceanic flight information
        regions (FIRs) need to add the phrase “Pass to Hilda” to Air Traffic Control (ATC) position
        reports. Crews may also use the ARINC frequencies listed in the aircrew flimsy for C2 phone
        patch requirements. Use ARINC phone patch only after exhausting normal communication meth-
        ods.
     2.5.8. High Frequency (HF) Communications. HF is the primary means of access to the worldwide
     C2 network.
        2.5.8.1. The secondary HF radio should be operated in Automatic Link Establishment (ALE)
        mode to support voice contacts between the PIC and MAJCOM C2.
NOTE: Run the ALE system in the silent mode during flights where pilots use the HF radio system for
communication with ATC.
     2.5.9. L-Band SATCOM. L-Band SATCOM provides a worldwide communications capability (sec-
     ondary to HF). L-band SATCOM may be used for routine communication if the message is unclassi-
     fied. Due to large volume of traffic, MAJCOM C2 will only forward 3-hour out or other L-Band
     messages when specifically requested. In this case, the L-Band message to MAJCOM C2 must
     include, “Relay, no C2 agent (or negative HF contact) at (include station name)” in the message
     remarks.
        2.5.9.1. Employment. Limit SATCOM communications to operational traffic. Turn the trans-
        ceiver and laptop on during preflight and leave it configured to transmit and receive messages
        until aircraft power down at destination. For missions operating through sensitive or classified
        locations disable the Global Positioning System (GPS) position-reporting feature.
        2.5.9.2. Home Station. Operations groups will be responsible for storing, maintaining day-to-day
        control, and administrative accountability of computers. Crews departing home station without a
        laptop computer will inform TACC. Laptops stay with crew not airplane. Exception: For unit
        deployments, deployed commanders may develop alternate laptop transfer procedures for
        deployed crews.
        2.5.9.3. En route. Issue one laptop to each crew; including stage crews.
            2.5.9.3.1. Laptops may be secured aboard aircraft which have been modified with a suitable
            secure container. On aircraft lacking a suitable secure container, computers will be stored in
            the command post or other suitable MAF C2 Center.
        2.5.9.4. Staging Operations. Control procedures should ensure crews maintain original laptop
        computer issued by home station. Do not store laptop computers on aircraft during staging opera-
        tions.
        2.5.9.5. L-Band SATCOM Messages and Advisories.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                               21


          2.5.9.5.1. On-station Message. Transmit an on-station message at the beginning of each crew
          duty day.
          2.5.9.5.2. Arrival Advisory. IAW paragraph 2.5.6.
          2.5.9.5.3. Advisories. Transmit (free-text messages) mission delay, in-flight refuel, on/
          off-load reports.
          2.5.9.5.4. When using L-Band SATCOM, include “TACC please confirm addressee received
          this message,” in remarks field.
      2.5.9.6. On flight-managed missions, aircrews will ensure the L-band SATCOM is on and moni-
      tored during the flight, and messages are addressed to the appropriate flight manager. The address
      with the appropriate FM station number is found in the flight manager contact information section
      of the aircrew departure papers.
   2.5.10. DV Messages. Airborne unclassified messages originated by DV passengers may be transmit-
   ted at the discretion of the PIC.
   2.5.11. Iridium Phone. Iridium phones may be used for communications between aircrews and com-
   mand and control agencies when beyond-line of sight C2 is required and other line of sight communi-
   cations, HF, Aero I, or L-Band, do not provide proper security or timeliness.
      2.5.11.1. Turn off Iridium phones within 25 feet of ground refueling operations.
      2.5.11.2. Iridium phones are not currently approved for use in-flight on the KC-10. Planning is
      underway for permanent Iridium phone installation and in-flight usage on the KC-10.

2.6. Mission Commander (MC).
   2.6.1. Unit commanders shall designate a MC when more than two aircraft are assembled to perform
   missions away from home station. Unit commanders should consider appointing a MC for special,
   high-visibility missions (i.e. CAPSTONE, DV2, etc.). The MC has overall responsibility and is the
   final authority for decisions that impact mission execution. The MC shall properly coordinate mission
   details. For flight-managed sorties, the MC shall coordinate any special mission planning require-
   ments with the IFM mission allocator not later than 24 hours prior to mission execution.
      2.6.1.1. For MAJCOM-tasked missions, MAJCOM/A3/DO will coordinate and designate a lead
      planning agency when more than one unit is involved in an AR, airdrop, or tactical airland opera-
      tion. The OG/CC for the lead planning agency will designate an MC. The MC will be a rated (nor-
      mally field grade) officer qualified in the type mission.
      2.6.1.2. For fighter moves, a planner in the tasked unit(s) will coordinate tanker support with Air
      Combat Command (ACC) Air Operations Squadron (AOS) and provide tanker flight planning
      based on ACC AOS/AODX produced profile.
   2.6.2. During MAJCOM AOS planned moves, the tanker MC is the final authority and shall ensure
   tanker aircrew members have properly coordinated mission details for the deployment IAW AFI
   11-207, Combat Aircraft Delivery.
      2.6.2.1. The MC will ensure all collocated aircrew members attend required briefings. The MC
      and all tanker aircrew members will attend the appropriate MAJCOM AOS/Delivery Control
      Officer (DCO) pre-takeoff briefing. The PIC may excuse boom operators and flight engineers
22                                                  AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


        from required briefings for preflight duties. Cover tanker specific information in the pre-takeoff
        briefing to coordinate all takeoff, formation, en route, AR, and recovery requirements between
        tanker and receiver aircraft.
        2.6.2.2. When non-collocated, the MC (in conjunction with the lead planning agency) will ensure
        non-collocated aircrew members receive applicable information, to include rendezvous, forma-
        tion, abort, and recovery procedures.

2.7. DUAL ROLE Procedures.
     2.7.1. A valid DUAL ROLE contains the following:
        2.7.1.1. A MAJCOM-validated AR requirement. TACC/XOOK must receive validated require-
        ment NLT 14 days before mission start date to ensure proper mission support.
        2.7.1.2. The user must have a MAJCOM validated and TACC/XOOKP approved cargo require-
        ment of at least six pallets of cargo, not including baggage.
     2.7.2. Since DUAL ROLE is primarily an AR mission, the tanker pilot must first meet the AR
     requirement without regard to protecting ancillary cargo capability.
     2.7.3. AMC does not guarantee DUAL ROLE ancillary cargo movements and will not expend addi-
     tional tanker sorties or hours to refuel a DUAL ROLE KC-10 (i.e. force extension) for the purpose of
     moving ancillary cargo.

2.8. C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. Table 2.1. contains a list of TACC phone numbers. Crewmem-
bers may also use the TACC toll-free number, 1-800-AIR-MOBL, to contact other offices within the
TACC, including flight managers.

2.9. Close Watch Missions. Close Watch missions (for example, Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR);
Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), PHOENIX BANNER) receive special C2 attention. PICs will promptly
notify appropriate C2 agency of delays, aborts, or other events that affect on-time departure. Provide the
C2 agent the estimated time in commission (ETIC), planned ETD, and estimated time of arrival (ETA)
within 10 minutes of the event or as soon as safety allows.

2.10. Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DOD) to cooperate
with civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-801, Assistance to
Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, provides the policies and procedures service members must follow
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                              23


when supporting federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement agencies. Coordinate all civilian law
enforcement authorities’ requests for assistance through appropriate C2 channels.

                                                 Chapter 3

                            AIRCREW COMPLEMENT/MANAGEMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides guiding principles to form/manage mobility aircrews. Commanders
at all levels shall follow these policies to form aircrews and to develop aircrew-related work/rest sched-
ules that optimize efficiency of mobility forces engaged in worldwide operations.

3.2. Aircrew Complement. SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on fragmentation order/mission direc-
tive, Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP) requirements, aircrew member qualifications,
and other constraints to safely accomplish the mission tasking. Table 3.1. summarizes crew position
requirements for different crew types.
     3.2.1. The minimum aircrew member complement for a local training flight is an aircraft commander,
     pilot/copilot, flight engineer, and a boom operator. When a mission requires more than one aircrew
     member at a position, the SQ/CC will determine whether an instructor and non-mission ready (NMR)
     crewmember meet mission requirements.
     3.2.2. SQ/CCs shall form augmented aircrews for missions planned to take longer than a basic CDT.
     Augmenting aircrew members must be current, qualified, and Mission Ready (MR) IAW AFI
     11-2KC-10V1, KC-10 Aircrew Training. EXCEPTION: A Non-Mission Ready (NMR) pilot may
     augment provided the other two pilots are MR instructor pilots. A NMR boom operator (BO) may be
     used as an augmentee if accompanied by two other fully qualified, MR boom operators (at least one
     must be an instructor). The NMR boom operator must be supervised by the instructor BO during all
     portions of the mission for which he/she is not fully qualified. SQ/CC shall augment an aircrew for the
     full Flight Duty Period (FDP). The MAJCOM/A3/DO may augment aircrews while the flight is
     underway. (see paragraph 3.11., Aircrew Management, for more on CDT/FDP.)

       2. When a mission will have more than 40 passengers on board, SQ/CC will ensure the aircrew
          compliment includes an extra (passenger-qualified) boom operator or aircrew member able to
          fulfill passenger-handling role.
       3. SQ/CC shall form aircrews with three boom operators when the total number of passengers
          exceeds 40 and multiple air refuelings are anticipated.

3.3. Aircrew Member Qualification. An aircrew member will be qualified, or in qualification training,
to perform duties as a primary aircrew member.
   3.3.1. Senior leaders who complete a Senior Staff Qualification course (restricted AF IMT 8, Certif-
   icate of Aircrew Qualification) or orientation for a Senior Staff Familiarization flight may occupy a
   primary crew position when under direct instructor supervision.
   3.3.2. Crewmembers who complete the Senior Staff Course will log “FP” for Flight Authorization
   Duty Code on the AFTO IMT 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
   3.3.3. Crewmembers who complete a Senior Staff Familiarization flight will log “OP” for Flight
   Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO IMT 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.

3.4. Pilots. An instructor pilot (IP) must supervise non-current or unqualified pilots regaining currency or
qualification (direct IP supervision during critical phases of flight).
   3.4.1. SQ/CCs shall designate those additional pilots authorized to perform PIC duties. The PIC shall
   brief the aircrew on the plan to transfer PIC duties.
   3.4.2. Missions With Passengers. Only current and qualified pilots (possessing an AF IMT 8, Certif-
   icate of Aircrew Qualification) will occupy pilot seats with passengers on board.
       3.4.2.1. A non-current but qualified pilot may fly with passengers on board if under direct IP
       supervision.

3.5. Not used.

3.6. Boom Operators, Flight Engineers. A non-current or unqualified boom operator, or flight engineer
may serve as a primary aircrew member on any mission when supervised by a qualified instructor or flight
examiner (direct supervision for critical phases of flight).
   3.6.1. A NMR boom operator may be used as an augmentee provided a fully qualified and instructor
   boom operator is on board. The instructor boom operator shall supervise the NMR boom operator dur-
   ing portions of the mission the NMR boom operator performs primary crew duties.

3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and en route C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles permit an air-
crew adequate time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for rest.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP). FDP is the period of time starting at mission report time and ending
   immediately after the aircrew completes the final engine shutdown of the day. SQ/CCs shall form air-
   crews based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Reduce FDP when the autopilot pitch axis
26                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


     fails after departure IAW information below. If the autopilot fails after departure, consider mission
     requirements and determine the best course of action to preclude further mission delays due to
     reduced FDP. The best course of action may include diverting to an airfield with maintenance capabil-
     ity. Contact C2, coordinate intentions, and comply with limitations.
        3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew is 16 hours (12 hours when the
        autopilot pitch axis is inoperative or the autopilot cannot be coupled to the FMS). Once an aircrew
        begins a basic FDP, only MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend it to an augmented day regardless of air-
        crew composition (MAJCOM/A3/DO shall augment basic crew to extend FDP).
            3.7.1.1.1. When extended en route ground times, non-optimum routing/winds, weather delays
            or other extenuating circumstances will increase a basic to an augmented FDP, a PIC with an
            augmented crew may accept an augmented FDP as long as:
                3.7.1.1.1.1. The C2 agent or PIC discovers the extenuating circumstances before the first
                takeoff of the day.
                3.7.1.1.1.2. The PIC verifies all augmenting aircrew members can get adequate rest en
                route.
            3.7.1.1.2. A PIC with a basic crew may seek MAJCOM/A3/DO (mission execution authority)
            approval to extend the FDP as much as 2 hours to complete a scheduled mission. Only use this
            provision to recover from unscheduled/unplanned en route delays. C2 agents shall not ask
            PICs to exercise this option.
        3.7.1.2. Augmented Crew FDP. Maximum FDP for an augmented aircrew is 24 hours (16 hours
        when the autopilot pitch axis is inoperative). SQ/CC need only augment the pilot portion of the
        aircrew when the autopilot pitch axis is inoperative.
            3.7.1.2.1. SQ/CC will augment an aircrew when FDP exceeds 16 hours and the mission pro-
            file will allow augmenting aircrew members adequate time to rest en route. As a minimum, the
            mission profile must provide the following:
                3.7.1.2.1.1. No more than 2 intermediate stops after 14 hours of FDP (each receiver AR
                shall count as an intermediate stop).
                3.7.1.2.1.2. Mission profile shall include at least one 6 hour leg or two 4 hour legs.
                3.7.1.2.1.3. The PIC shall validate planned leg times based on actual conditions.
        3.7.1.3. Flight examiners administering evaluations will not exceed an augmented FDP.
        3.7.1.4. Training, Tactical, Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT), and Func-
        tional Check Flights/Acceptance Check Flights (FCFs/ACFs) FDP:
            3.7.1.4.1. Maximum FDP for training, tactical, and FCF/ACF missions is 16 hours (12 hours
            when the autopilot pitch axis is inoperative). Conduct the mission as follows:
            3.7.1.4.2. Complete all mission-related events (i.e., FCF/ACF checks, transition events, or
            tactical events) during the first 12 hours of the FDP (EXCEPTION: FTU missions and flight
            evaluations).
            3.7.1.4.3. AFRC crews may perform mission-related events on local training missions pro-
            vided their time from start of duty does not exceed 16 hours and actual flight duty does not
            exceed 12 hours.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                27


              3.7.1.4.3.1. Crew duty time (CDT) and FDP include both military duty and civilian work.
              CDT and FDP begin when an individual reports for their first duty period (military or civil-
              ian).
   3.7.2. Crew Duty Time (CDT). CDT is that period of time an aircrew may perform combined ground/
   flight duties. Plan the mission so aircrew members may complete post-mission duties within maxi-
   mum CDT. An aircrew member may perform mission-related duties for other missions when
   approved by member’s home station SQ/CC or equivalent. Maximum CDT is 18+00 hours for a basic
   aircrew and 24+45 hours for an augmented aircrew.
   3.7.3. Except as outlined below, CDT/FDP begins 1 hour after aircrew alert notification. SQ/CC or
   equivalent may task aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin flight-related duties or
   MAJCOM/A3/DO may authorize a C2 agent to alert an aircrew member early: begin CDT/FDP when
   the first aircrew member reports for those duties.
       3.7.3.1. For self-alerts, the PIC shall coordinate early individual/crew mission report times with
       C2 agents. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for duty.
       3.7.3.2. CDT/FDP Extensions. See AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
   3.7.4. Deadhead Time. MAF aircrew members may deadhead for the purpose of positioning or
   de-positioning to perform a mobility mission or mission support function. Crewmembers may dead-
   head for a maximum of 24 hours. OG/CC or equivalent may approve crewmembers to deadhead in
   excess of 24 hours.
       3.7.4.1. Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after deadhead-
       ing, provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at report time for deadhead flight).
       3.7.4.2. Aircrew members may deadhead after performing primary crew duties for a maximum of
       24 hours from the time the crewmember’s FDP began.
   3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo up-/off-load,
   start, and taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3, paragraph 9.7.2. The duty day
   begins when the aircrew member reports for official duties.
       3.7.5.1. Aircrew members shall receive a 12 hour rest period before performing aircraft genera-
       tion activities. The duty day shall not exceed 12 hours or 4 pre-flights.
       3.7.5.2. The OG/CC (or equivalent) is waiver authority for 12 hour rest period (not less than 8
       hours). Limit duty day for aircraft generation activities with less than 12 hour rest period to 10
       hours.
       3.7.5.3. MAJCOM/A3/DO is waiver authority for rest periods of less than 8 hours

3.8. Scheduling Restrictions. In accordance with paragraph 9.8. of AFI 11-202V3. In addition, SQ/CCs
shall not schedule an aircrew member to fly nor will an aircrew member perform aircrew duties:
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3.
   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff, or ALFA
   standby force legal for alert time, or earliest show time from BRAVO alert) or while under the influ-
   ence of alcohol.
28                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


     3.8.3. When using nasal sprays to treat symptoms of head congestion existing before flight. An air-
     crew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays as “get-me-downs” following an
     unexpected ear or sinus block during flight.

3.9. Counter-Fatigue Management Program.
     3.9.1. Aircrew may use medications with prior approval (on a voluntary basis following ground test-
     ing) that enhance natural rest during off-cycle crew rest periods. This section provides guidance for
     the use of no-go pills (prescription medications) that help aircrew initiate and maintain restful sleep
     during off-cycle (desynchronosis) crew rest periods. Aircrews shall not use no-go pills in flight.
     3.9.2. It is USAF policy that aircrew shall never use no-go pills as a first choice counter-fatigue man-
     agement tool.
     3.9.3. Responsibility for counter-fatigue management of aircrew medicinal products rests with the
     home station Flight Surgeon (FS), OG/CC (may delegate to but no lower than squadron commander),
     and with each individual aircrew member. During extended deployments, aircrew members will only
     obtain no-go pills from a deployed USAF flight surgeon. The deployed flight surgeon shall consult
     with the home unit medical team prior to dispensing no-go pills to deployed fliers.
     3.9.4. Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs shall include use of no-go medication
     with OG/CC and FS oversight. A basic counter-fatigue ORM model is available for mission planners,
     OG/CC, crew, and FS on the AMC/A37V website.
     3.9.5. Home station or deployed FS trained using the AMC/SG-approved (lead command) counter
     fatigue program is the point of contact for no-go prescription. Upon request, the FS will advise/assist
     the local OG/CC to identify missions that may impair crew rest caused by duty day length, departure
     and arrival times, and other mission timelines.
     3.9.6. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will follow PRP notification
     procedures if prescribed no-go Pills.
     3.9.7. The OG/CC shall establish a system to inform the FS when missions fall into any of the follow-
     ing categories (may cause sleep disruptions and are therefore candidates for no-go medications):
        3.9.7.1. Home station night launch missions greater than four hours duration.
        3.9.7.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal sleeping environment (quiet, cooled, and dark-
        ened).
        3.9.7.3. Off-station missions that are 4 or more time zones from home station.
        3.9.7.4. Rotating schedules (stair-stepped flying schedules) with greater then 6-hour flight time
        duration.
        3.9.7.5. Missions that run consistently near a 14-hour (or greater) duty day.
     3.9.8. SQ/CC will not schedule crewmembers to fly or perform crew duties within 12 hours of con-
     suming no-go pills (consider DNIF). EXCEPTION: commanders may reduce the 12-hour timeline
     after consult with a flight surgeon to confirm prescribed no-go pills have short duration effect [6 hours
     for ambien (zolpidem) and 4 hours for sonata (zaleplon)]. In no case will crewmembers consume a
     no-go pill on a timeline where they would be under the effect of the medication while they perform
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                  29


   aircrew duties (use mission report or legal for alert time to determine latest time to take no-go medica-
   tion).
   3.9.9. Aircrew member’s responsibilities:
      3.9.9.1. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for no-go pills and receive flight surgeon
      clearance prior to using no-go pills in the operational environment.
      3.9.9.2. Aircrew members shall not operate equipment within the DNIF periods as specified in
      paragraph 3.9.8. for each of the no-go pills.
      3.9.9.3. Aircrew members shall not take no-go-pills within 12 hours of consuming alcohol.
      3.9.9.4. Aircrew will inform the FS of any other medications (including nutritional supplements
      and over the counter medications) they are taking so the FS can evaluate potential interactions.
      3.9.9.5. Limit use of restoril and ambien to a maximum of seven consecutive days and no more
      than 20 days in a 60-day period.
      3.9.9.6. Limit use of sonata to a maximum of 10 consecutive days and no more than 28 days in a
      60-day period.

3.10. Crew Rest/En route Ground Time. OG/CCs shall establish procedures to place crewmembers in
crew rest. MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive any portion of the crew rest period or ground time as needed to
meet mission tasking.
   3.10.1. Home-Station Pre-Departure Crew Rest. For missions that will keep aircrew members off sta-
   tion 16 hours or more, unit commanders will enter primary and deadhead aircrew members into
   pre-departure crew rest 24 hours before the legal for alert time. Aircrew members may perform lim-
   ited non-flying duties like mission planning during the first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest. OG/
   CCs may waive any portion of the first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest. Do not manifest deadhead
   aircrew members as passengers to deny pre-departure crew rest. EXCEPTION: AFRC in accordance
   with AFI 11-202V3 and appropriate supplement.
   3.10.2. Off-station/En route Crew Rest. The minimum en route crew rest period is 12 hours before
   legal for alert or scheduled report time when self-alerting.
      3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/A3/DO, C2 agents shall not
      disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When necessary to interrupt aircrew members’ crew rest
      period, re-enter that aircrew in a subsequent minimum 12 hour crew rest period after they com-
      plete official duties.
      3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-flight
      duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, refueling, cargo on-/off-load, aircrew
      arming, minor maintenance, or mission debriefing.
   3.10.3. Off-station/En route Ground Time. Mobility planners shall provide aircrews at least 17 hours
   (18+15 hours for dual role missions and en route channel mission stops with a cargo download or
   upload – allows for cargo loading operations upon arrival and 3+15 show for departure) ground time
   between engine shutdown and subsequent takeoff.
      3.10.3.1. Mission planners, PICs, or C2 agents may modify ground time as follows:
          3.10.3.1.1. In the interest of safety.
30                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


            3.10.3.1.2. To start (mission reporting time) no earlier than 12 hours from the time the aircrew
            entered crew rest. Before reducing ground time, PICs will consider time to complete mission
            planning, cargo on-/off-load, and non-standard mission related duties. C2 agents will not ask
            PICs to accept less than 17 hours ground time.
        3.10.3.2. Mobility planners should construct mission itineraries with en route ground times longer
        than 17 hours to afford aircrew members opportunities to recover from the cumulative affects of
        fatigue caused by flying on several consecutive days or due to transiting several time zones. If
        practical, make the en route ground time 36 hours (maximum) after three consecutive near maxi-
        mum FDPs.
     3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-of-flight delay
     but provides PICs a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert and report period outside
     normal duty time. CECR periods should be of minimum duration and are normally used during
     de-positioning legs. Tasking authorities shall approve requests to delay alert time to normalize the
     work-rest cycle or increase messing options when mission allows. When requests are disapproved, the
     C2 agent will inform the PIC of the reason for disapproval.
     3.10.5. Post-Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning to home
     base sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to personal needs.
     PMCR begins upon mission termination. (N/A AFRC).
        3.10.5.1. For missions that keep an aircrew off station 16 or more hours, the SQ/CC shall provide
        1 hour (up to 96 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter aircrew members in
        pre-departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires.
        3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and MAJCOM/A3/DO may suspend
        PMCR during contingency operations.
        3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
     3.10.6. Flying Crew Chief (FCC) Work/Rest Plan. While on Temporary Duty (TDY), the deployed
     FCC or MEGP maintenance technician shall report to the PIC. In conjunction with en route/transient
     maintenance supervisor, the PIC will determine how long the crew chief can safely perform aircraft
     maintenance duties. The PIC shall ensure the FCC has sufficient time in each 24-hour period to get 8
     hours of uninterrupted rest. See AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Management, for
     detailed guidance.
     3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved crew rest criteria in the
     Exercise or Contingency Operation Order (OPORD), Operation Plan (OPLAN) or Concept of Opera-
     tions (CONOPs).
     3.10.8. The Prime Knight program streamlines the process of getting aircrews from aircraft parking
     ramp into lodging/crew rest. It is only successful when billeting agents receive accurate aircrew/mis-
     sion information in a timely manner.
        3.10.8.1. C2 Agent Responsibilities. A MAJCOM C2 agent will forward information on the
        departing aircrew’s orders to a point of contact (POC) for the next crew rest location’s Prime
        Knight function.
        3.10.8.2. PIC Responsibilities. If departing from a location with a C2 agency, ensure a C2 agent
        has accurate aircrew/mission information to forward to the next Prime Knight POC. If departing
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                   31


       from a facility without a C2 agency, the PIC will call the next crew rest location Prime Knight
       POC to pass aircrew/mission information.
       3.10.8.3. SQ/CC or designated authenticating official shall ensure TDY/Flight orders clearly indi-
       cate the unit fund cite so that the PIC may make Prime Knight reservations in advance. Without a
       unit fund cite on the TDY/Flight orders, the PIC must make advance reservations using a govern-
       ment travel card to participate in the Prime Knight program.

3.11. Alerting Procedures. MAJCOM C2 agents shall establish a legal for alert time with the PIC and
when appropriate, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) of Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) crews. Whenever
possible, C2 agents will inform PICs and MCDs of aircraft status, expected patient up load time, and other
pertinent mission details that will streamline mission launch.
   3.11.1. Aircrew alert time is normally 4+l5 hours before scheduled takeoff time (allows 1 hour for
   reporting and 3+l5 hours for mission preparation). OG/CCs may establish self-alert procedures for
   local training missions.
       3.11.1.1. For missions with more than minimum ground time, the PIC may arrange an alert time
       that provides additional preparation time to accomplish the mission. The PIC may also accept
       alerting with reduced preparation time when the mission allows. In all cases, the PIC shall coordi-
       nate changes to standard alerting times with the appropriate C2 agency.
       3.11.1.2. With PIC agreement and when cargo load warrants (i.e. outsized and Dash 9 section V
       cargo), C2 agents may alert boom operators up to 2 hours before normal alert time. When early
       alerting is warranted, the PIC and C2 agent must notify the boom operator before he/she enters
       crew rest. Do not alert the boom operator more than 1 hour before beginning cargo up load. Base
       the aircrew FDP on the boom operator’s show time.
       3.11.1.3. C2 agents shall not alert an aircrew until the aircraft is in commission or there is reason-
       able assurance that maintenance technicians will complete repairs that allow the aircrew time to
       pre-flight and load the aircraft to meet the target takeoff time.
       3.11.1.4. C2 agents shall not alert outbound crews when inbound aircraft is on A-2 or A-3 status
       until maintenance technicians determine required parts are available and the aircraft will be
       repaired within the target ground time.
       3.11.1.5. Self-Alerts. Crews will self-alert at locations without a C2 agency, but must coordinate
       with controlling C2 agency. The PIC may elect to self-alert on operational missions at locations
       with a C2 agency. Coordinate the alert time with local C2 agents to avoid FDP limitations that
       result from unexpected changes in the mission.
   3.11.2. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
       3.11.2.1. On the aircrew’s initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2 agent, or PIC
       during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time.
       3.11.2.2. For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected alert time.
       The PIC may extend that window to 8 hours when flying as primary crew or 12 hours when dead-
       heading. The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to accept more than the 6 hour window.
       ANG/ AFRC aircrew members may extend the window as necessary to deadhead to home station
       to meet the Firm Scheduled Return Time (FSRT).
32                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


        3.11.2.3. When a C2 agent determines circumstances will not allow for aircrew alerting during
        the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time, the C2 agent
        will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12 hours from the time of noti-
        fication.
        3.11.2.4. At the end of the legal for alert window or if a mission cannot depart within 4 hours of
        scheduled takeoff time, the PIC will contact a C2 agent and establish a new expected alert time.
        The PIC may extend takeoff window to 6 hours.

3.12. Stage Management.
     3.12.1. Stage Posture. Stages operate on a positive launch principle. C2 agents shall alert aircrews
     using the following priority/hierarchy:
        3.12.1.1. Aircrews that require an emergency return to home station.
        3.12.1.2. De-positioning stage crews will be prioritized by their SRTs.
        3.12.1.3. Crews in stage over 48 hours.
        3.12.1.4. Aircrews in sequence of arrival time.
        3.12.1.5. If the stage manager returns an aircrew in the stage to crew rest because of a mission
        delay or abort, that aircrew becomes first out when legal for alert.
     3.12.2. Mechanical Stage. A C2 agent may create a mechanical stage when a delayed or aborted mis-
     sion will not resume before that aircrew’s FDP expires. Aircrews in a mechanical stage will be first
     out when a mission in the same direction transits their location while they are legal for alert. A C2
     agent may bump an inbound aircrew with FDP to complete that mission to cycle aircrews in a
     mechanical stage.

3.13. Standby Force Duty. MAJCOM C2 Agents shall task units for Standby Force Duty not later than
18 hours prior to legal for alert time. This allows crewmembers 12 hours of pre-standby crew rest and 6
hours for aircraft pre-flight duty. When aircrews are unable to complete all preflight duties within 6 hours
of crew show time, provide an additional 12-hour pre-standby crew rest. If MAJCOM C2 agents are
unable to provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest
and follow aircraft generation procedures in paragraph 3.7.5. to prepare the aircraft for launch. SQ/CC
may keep an aircrew in ALFA/BRAVO status up to 48 hours. MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend this period
for contingencies. After 48 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12 hour pre-departure crew rest.
OG/CCs may provide additional local procedures for management of Standby Force Duties.
     3.13.1. ALFA Standby Aircraft Preflight Generation and Security. When tasked, SQ/CC shall pos-
     ture an aircraft and aircrew as an ALFA Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour. The following
     procedures apply to primary aircraft as well as spare aircraft generated for ALFA alerts. A mainte-
     nance Dash -6 and aircrew Dash -1 preflight must be completed. Preflight validity will be in accor-
     dance with applicable T.O. After the preflight, the PIC will notify the controlling agency. The aircraft
     will remain in a sealed posture and be referred to as “cocked on alert”. Documentation of when the air-
     craft was cocked on alert must be placed in the forms. The PIC will ensure the aircraft is secure before
     entering crew rest. Secure all hatches and doors to show unauthorized entry. The aircrew preflight
     portion remains valid if performed by one crew, cocked on alert, and launched by another crew.
     Uncocking a generated aircraft is not a standard procedure but may be accomplished on a case by case
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                33


   basis. The PIC or a designated aircrew representative must be present if access to the aircraft is
   required. Ensure command and control and the controlling agency are notified when uncocking and
   recocking generated aircraft. Follow-on pre-flights done during normal waking hours do not interrupt
   crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when C2 agent directs the aircrew to launch from crew rest or while per-
   forming pre-flight (begin CDT/FDP when the aircrew arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-flight).
   3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and/or aircrew in
   BRAVO Standby Force to permit launch within 3 hours. Follow-on pre-flights, if required, interrupt
   crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when aircrew shows for duty.
   3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a CHARLIE
   Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be legal for alert 12 hours
   after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE status up to 72 hours. After 72 hours,
   release aircrews from CHARLIE Standby or enter them into 12 hours crew rest for directed mission,
   training mission, or subsequent standby force duty.
   3.13.4. Wing Standby Force. OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status. After a 12 hour
   pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be able to launch
   within 3+15 hours. After 12 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrews in 12 hour crew rest period
   before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty.
   3.13.5. Post-Standby Missions. On completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be dispatched
   on a mission. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start of pre-departure
   crew rest. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the post-mission crew rest time
   on standby time plus mission time.
   3.13.6. Post Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following standby
   duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
       3.13.6.1. If standby duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is computed
       from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
       3.13.6.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is authorized.

3.14. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. Refer to DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibil-
ity, AFI 11-401, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.

3.15. Not Used.

3.16. Additional Crewmembers (ACM). Crewmembers qualified in mobility aircraft are authorized
ACM status on any mobility aircraft to pre/de-position in support of mobility operations. MAJCOM des-
ignated crewmembers who are assigned or authorized to accompany the normal crew compliment are
allowed ACM status.
   3.16.1. Crewmembers in ACM status are not authorized to:
       3.16.1.1. Displace manifested passengers.
       3.16.1.2. Maintain currency and/or log flying time.
       3.16.1.3. Use for transportation while on leave.

        EXCEPTION: AFRC Air Reserve Technicians may be in a civilian leave status while traveling
        en route to perform in a military duty status.
        3.16.1.4. Travel on Special Air Missions/Command Support Mission (SAM/CSM) aircraft unless
        authorized by HQ AF/CVAM through the PIC.
        3.16.1.5. Travel on Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) when specifically restricted by
        the mission directive (Form 59).
        3.16.1.6. Travel on Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft unless authorized by Joint Opera-
        tional Support Airlift Command (JOSAC) through the PIC.
     3.16.2. All ACMs require valid travel/flight orders or supporting message authorizing ACM status.
     OG/CCs may authorize ACM status for their mobility aircrews.
     3.16.3. Flight evaluators have priority and will not be displaced by any other ACM. The priority for
     evaluators is MAJCOM, NAF, group, and then squadron level.
     3.16.4. ACMs normally travel in the crew compartment. If the number of ACMs desiring travel
     exceeds the capacity of the crew compartment, the C2 agency will notify the ATOC, who in turn will
     coordinate with the passenger terminal; seats not previously assigned may be used for ACMs.
     3.16.5. The PIC, or designated representative, will brief ACMs on seat assignment, appropriate mis-
     sion information, emergency procedures including egress, and armed crewmembers. The PIC may
     assign an ACM aircrew-related duties for which the ACM is qualified.
     3.16.6. ACMs will coordinate their travel with the appropriate C2 agency prior to travel. They will
     process through the C2 agency as early as possible but NLT 3 hours prior to planned block time.

3.17. Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP). Procedures and policies regarding MEGP are
contained in AFI 11-401 and AMCI 11-208. PICs will ensure personnel traveling in this status are prop-
erly authorized.

3.18. Mission Mobility Observers (MMO). MAJCOM supplements or additional directives may estab-
lish programs authorizing senior military and civilian personnel to fly for mobility mission familiariza-
tion. For AMC MMO information reference AMCI 11-208.

3.19. Flight Attendants on Distinguished Visitor Missions. Flight attendants may fly as primary crew-
members on designated KC-10 missions. They fall under the authority of the PIC, or MC, if assigned,
throughout the mission. An egress briefing will be given to the flight attendants prior to the first mission
leg.

                                                 Chapter 4

                             AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. Redundant systems may allow crews to safely perform some missions when a compo-
nent/system is degraded. The PIC is the final authority in determining the overall suitability of an aircraft
for the mission. The PIC will ensure a detailed explanation of the discrepancy is entered in the AFTO
Form 781A (IMT-V1), Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document; include the following mainte-
nance identifiers to effectively communicate aircraft status:
   4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem component
   essential for safe aircraft operation as ME.
   4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem component,
   which is not currently essential for safe aircraft operation as MC. These discrepancies should be
   cleared at the earliest opportunity. If circumstances change or mission safety would be compromised,
   re-designate as ME. Do not delay a mission to clear a MC discrepancy.
   4.1.3. Open Item (OI). The PIC will designate discrepancies not expected to adversely impact the cur-
   rent mission or any subsequent mission as an OI. These items are normally cleared at home station.
   Do not accept an aircraft from factories, modification centers, or depots unless all instruments are
   installed and operative.

4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. It is impractical to prepare a list that would anticipate all
possible combinations of equipment malfunctions and contingent circumstances. This chapter and the
KC-10 MEL (T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1-2) list the equipment and systems considered essential for routine as
well as contingency operations. The list does not necessarily include all equipment or systems essential to
airworthiness (e.g. rudder, ailerons, elevators, flaps, tires, etc.). A PIC accepting an aircraft with degraded
equipment/systems is not committed to subsequent operations with the same degraded equipment. PICs
are not committed to operations with degraded equipment accepted by another PIC.
   4.2.1. The PIC shall account for the possibility of additional failures during continued operation with
   inoperative systems or components. The MEL is not intended for continued operation over an indefi-
   nite period with systems/subsystems inoperative.
   4.2.2. All emergency equipment will be installed unless specifically exempted by mission require-
   ments/directives.
   4.2.3. Waiver Policy. A PIC prepared to operate with a degraded MEL item shall request a waiver
   through C2 channels. The PIC shall provide the C2 agent: 1) nature of request, 2) individual crew
   member qualification(s), 3) mission leg(s) requiring the waiver, and 4) the governing directive(s) of
   waiver request to include volume, chapter, or paragraph. Initiate waiver requests as soon as possible;
   plan at least a 1-hour waiver process time.
       4.2.3.1. Waivers to the KC-10 MEL require coordination between HQ AMC/A37V and the
       KC-10 Contractor Logistic Sustainment Wing (327 CLSG/GFLT). Contact HQ AMC/A37V
       through the TACC for waivers to the KC-10 MEL.
   4.2.4. PICs operating with waiver(s) for degraded equipment shall coordinate mission requirements
   (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements, etc.) with the controlling
   C2 agency and/or flight manager.
36                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


     4.2.5. If beyond C2 communication capability, or when it is necessary to protect the crew or aircraft
     from a situation not covered by this chapter and immediate action is required, the PIC may deviate
     according to paragraph 1.4. Report deviations (without waiver) through channels to MAJCOM/A3/
     DO within 48-hours. OG/CCs shall collect background information and submit a follow-up written
     report upon request.

4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waivers to operate with degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-case basis
and only in exceptional circumstances. The PIC determines the need for a waiver after coordinating with
the lowest practical level of command.
     4.3.1. Training Missions. OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority.
     4.3.2. MAJCOM Directed Missions. MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority for active
     duty, AFRC units flying MAJCOM-directed missions, including Operational Readiness Inspections
     (ORI). Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency. For AMC-directed missions contact HQ AMC/
     A37V through TACC.
     4.3.3. Contingency Missions. DIRMOBFOR (or equivalent) for the agency with C2, if not specified
     in the OPORD/Tasking Order.
     4.3.4. AFRC Directed Missions. AFRC maintains C2 and waiver authority for AFRC directed mis-
     sions prior to mobilization.
     4.3.5. Other Than MEL Waivers. Determine governing source document (i.e. AFI, Flight Manual,
     Maintenance T.O., etc.) to ascertain the waiver authority. Use C2 channels to notify the appropriate
     waiver authority. Waivers of this nature may require an extended response time.
     4.3.6. Engineering Dispositions (ED). Dispositions are requested when aircraft are damaged and/or
     established maintenance technical order procedures cannot be followed or do not exist. Most EDs
     allow maintenance to repair the aircraft and return it to unrestricted status; dispositions of this nature
     do not concern aircrews. However, EDs affecting aircrew operations require MEL waiver authority
     approval.
        4.3.6.1. PICs shall coordinate dispositions containing flight restrictions, prohibitions, additional
        operating limits, or modified/nonstandard operating procedures with the appropriate MEL waiver
        authority (see paragraph 4.3.).
        4.3.6.2. PICs will not accept dispositions appearing incomplete, in error, or unsafe. Prior to reject-
        ing a disposition, the PIC will contact the appropriate MEL waiver authority. The waiver authority
        will attempt to resolve the issue.
NOTE: Deviations from the flight manual requires approval IAW the flight manual.
     4.3.7. Airworthiness Directives (AD). ADs are legally enforceable rules issued by the Federal Avia-
     tion Administration. They are issued when an unsafe condition exists in a product and that condition
     is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design. ADs apply to aircraft main-
     tained using civil standards IAW AFPD 62-4, Standards of Airworthiness for Passenger Carrying
     Commercial Derivative Transport Aircraft, and AFPD 62-5, Standards of Airworthiness for Commer-
     cial Derivative Hybrid Aircraft. The aircraft’s System Program Office (SPO) is responsible for bring-
     ing ADs to the attention of the appropriate maintenance and operations units. When an AD is released
     the aircraft shall comply with the directive.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                  37


       4.3.7.1. PICs shall coordinate new ADs containing flight restrictions, prohibitions, additional
       operating limits, etc. with the appropriate MEL waiver authority (see paragraph 4.3.).

4.4. Technical Assistance. The PIC may request technical support and additional assistance from their
home unit or MAJCOM C2 agency.

4.5. One Engine Inoperative Ferry Flights. PICs will only conduct 2-engine ferry operations after
exhausting all other avenues to return an aircraft with an inoperative engine to MC status. With MAJ-
COM/A3/DO approval, PICs may fly a 2-engine ferry sortie using the following procedures. Two-engine
ferry flights are restricted to specially trained (Two-Engine Ferry Course, Q039) and designated crew-
members from AMC Stan/Eval or OG Stan/Eval.
   4.5.1. The PIC shall plan and obtain clearances to fly to the nearest destination possessing a usable
   maintenance support capability (stations with DC-10 or KC-10 common maintenance facilities) and
   alert all en route, alternate, and abort bases along the intended route of flight.
   4.5.2. The PIC shall abide by the aircraft flight manual and T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1-1 and 1C-10(K)A-1-5
   limitations. Ensure the aircraft is prepared for two-engine ferry according to T.O.s 1C-10(K)A-1-4
   and 1C-10(K)A-2-5.
   4.5.3. The aircraft MEL, does not apply. All primary aircraft systems not specifically associated with
   the failed engine must be fully operational.
   4.5.4. Download cargo, including mission support kits, before ferry operations (may remove the
   onboard cargo handling system to further reduce operational and zero fuel weights). Return all cargo
   and support equipment to the main operating base (MOB) of assignment via organic support aircraft
   or other airlift means.

4.6. Gear Down Flight Operations. Limit gear down flight operations to sorties required to move the
aircraft to a suitable repair facility. Consider gear down flight only after the PIC exhausts all avenues to
repair the aircraft in place.
   4.6.1. Standard climb-out flight path charts in T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1-1 do not account for a gear-down
   configuration. Therefore, PICs shall not takeoff until there is reasonable assurance that they will
   achieve/maintain adequate obstacle clearance (to include en route stops and alternates).
   4.6.2. Time and communications capability permitting, validate takeoff data with AMC Stan/Eval or
   OG Stan/Eval.

4.7. Fuel System Limitations. Normal fuel flow is tank-to-engine. Since main fuel tanks are an integral
part of the wings, do not fly an aircraft with an empty main tank without an AMC/A37V, AMC/A44, and
327 CLSG waiver. There are no flight restrictions with a body tank or tanks empty.

4.8. Slat Profile Flights. Use the following parameters/guide to perform slat profile flights:
   4.8.1. Limit fuel load to approximately 150,000 lbs of fuel (takeoff).
   4.8.2. No cargo.
   4.8.3. Extend slats to takeoff position.
   4.8.4. Approximately 12,000 feet pressure altitude.
38                                                 AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


4.9. Passenger Seat Limitations. If a passenger seat is broken (cannot be locked in the full upright posi-
tion) do not seat passengers in the broken seat for takeoff/landing. If a seatback contains a broken tray
table that will not stow/lock and cannot be secured by any other means, do not seat passengers directly
behind the seatback with the broken tray table for takeoff/landing. Affected seats may be occupied during
flight. Make every reasonable effort to repair the broken seat/tray table before turning away passengers.
Coordinate seat release changes to the appropriate C2 agency to avoid over-booking seats.

                                   OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. KC-10 checklists are designed as clean up checklists, and items may be accomplished
prior to the checklist being read. A checklist is not complete until all items have been accomplished.
Momentary hesitations for coordination items, air traffic control (ATC) interruptions and deviations spec-
ified in the flight manual, etc., are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures or limitations may
be added to the checklists. Currency of notes is a crewmember’s responsibility and may be evaluated.
   5.1.1. Checklist Inserts. AMC/A37V shall approve the use of checklist inserts IAW AFI 11-215. The
   inserts should be placed at the end of the appropriate checklist or in an in-flight guide. All checklist
   inserts must have a POC. OGVs shall approve local in-flight guides and inserts not affecting T.O.
   guidance and procedures.

5.2. Duty Station. Both pilots and the flight engineer shall be in their seats during flight. One of them
may be out of their seat for brief periods to meet physiological needs. IAW AFI 11-202V3, PICs may
authorize controlled cockpit rest for one pilot occupying a primary duty station during non-critical phases
of flight (the other pilot will be awake and alert).
   5.2.1. During cruise, boom operators may leave their duty station for longer periods. Instructor and
   evaluator pilots performing instructor/evaluator duties may occupy the boom operator’s forward posi-
   tion. In all cases, the PIC has final determination on who occupies the boom operator’s forward posi-
   tion. Crewmembers occupying the boom operator’s forward position are responsible for duties
   associated with that position IAW T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1.

5.3. Flight Station Entry. PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight station dur-
ing all phases of flight; the total number of persons permitted is limited to the number of seats with oper-
able seat belts and oxygen. Passengers and observers will not be permitted access to the pilot, copilot, or
flight engineer position regardless of its availability.

5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy. An aircraft commander, or above, will occupy either the left or the
right seat during all takeoffs and landings. The designated PIC (A-code) is not required to occupy a pri-
mary position, but still retains overall authority for conduct of the mission.
   5.4.1. An AC, IP, or evaluator pilot (EP) will make all approaches and landings during aircraft emer-
   gencies, unless conditions prevent compliance.

5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operating Policy. The pilot flying (PF) will command configuration
changes. The pilot not flying (PNF) will verify appropriate airspeed and configuration prior to echoing the
configuration command.

5.6. Outside Observer/Jump Seat Duties. Available crewmembers will assist in clearing during taxi
operations, and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet MSL.

5.7. Seat Belts.
   5.7.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt.
40                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


     5.7.2. Crewmembers will have seat belts fastened when occupying a duty position, unless crew duties
     dictate otherwise.
     5.7.3. All crewmembers will have seat belts fastened during takeoff and landing. Fasten shoulder har-
     ness unless crew duties dictate otherwise. For tactical/AR operations, all crewmembers and passen-
     gers will have seat belts fastened (unless authorized by the PIC or crew duties dictate otherwise;
     shoulder harness’ are not required for tanker AR). Crewmembers performing instructor or flight
     examiner duties are exempt from seat belt requirements if not occupying a primary crew position;
     however, they will have a seat available with an operable seat belt.
     5.7.4. Litter patients, actual or simulated, must remain secured on litters for takeoff and landing.

5.8. Aircraft Lighting. IAW AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the
Ground, and applicable T.O.s.

5.9. Portable Electronic Devices. IAW AFI 11-202V3.
     5.9.1. Do not connect unauthorized equipment (laptop computers, video equipment, food preparation
     equipment, radios/tape players, CD players, etc.) to the aircraft intercom, PA, radio systems, or elec-
     trical system. The only electrical outlets authorized for personal use are the outlets located in the air-
     craft lavatories. They are intended for electrical shavers or other small personal electronic devices.
     Approved vacuum cleaners are authorized for ground use.
     5.9.2. Aircrew members shall not use uncertified Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) or per-
     sonal devices with RF transmit/receive capability on AMC aircraft carrying hazard class 1 explosive
     cargo at anytime. Prohibited devices include cellular phones, and laptop computers/PDAs with wire-
     less capability enabled (i.e. Bluetooth). Boom operators will ensure passengers comply with this
     restriction. Aircrew members may use certified GFE such as PFPS laptops and PDAs with infrared
     transmitters.
     5.9.3. The following handheld (HH) GPS units meet the requirements of AFI 11-202V3 and may be
     used with approved laptop computers in flight: Bendix King KLX100 and Garmin GPS 35-USB.

5.10. Tobacco Use on Air Force Aircraft. Tobacco use of any type is prohibited on Air Force aircraft.

5.11. Advisory Calls. The pilot flying will periodically announce intentions during departures, arrivals,
approaches, and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. Table 5.1. through Table
5.4. depict mandatory calls for nonprecision approaches, precision approaches, climbout and descent,
respectively. Unless otherwise directed, the PF and FE will acknowledge all mandatory calls.

NOTES:
  1. The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land or go-around. If the runway environment is
     not in sight and/or the aircraft is not in position for a normal landing, a go around will be made.
     2. With weather at CAT 1 minimums on a CAT 1 ILS, the pilot may not see the runway environment
        at DH; however, the initial portion of the approach lights will be visible. The pilot may continue
        to 100 HAT with reference to the approach lights. The pilot may not descend below 100 feet
        above touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as reference unless the red terminating
        bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and identifiable.
     3. The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue, or go-around. Respond intention
        to “Land” if runway environment is in sight, will remain in sight throughout touchdown and the
        aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.
     4. Both pilots will state the altimeter setting.
     5.11.1. Deviations.
        5.11.1.1. The PNF will inform the PF when heading or airspeed deviations are observed, or when
        the altitude is more than 100 feet from the desired, and no attempt is being made to correct the
        deviation.
        5.11.1.2. Any crewmember seeing a deviation of 200 feet altitude or 10 knots in airspeed, or a
        potential terrain or obstruction problem, will immediately notify the PF. Deviations from pre-
        scribed procedures for the approach being flown will also be announced.

5.12. Communications Policy. The Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to aircrews
regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to maintain a high
degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
     5.12.1. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and mission
     accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, air refueling, approach, landing, and any flight below 10,000
     feet MSL.
     5.12.2. Aircraft Interphone. Primary crewmembers will monitor interphone during critical phases of
     flight. Crewmembers will advise the PF before checking off interphone. Crewmembers will ensure
     personnel on headset, or within listening distance, are cleared prior to discussing classified informa-
     tion over interphone.
     5.12.3. Command Radios.
        5.12.3.1. The PNF normally makes all ATC radio calls.
        5.12.3.2. In terminal areas, all crewmembers (if able) will monitor the command radio unless
        directed otherwise. A crewmember will be designated to monitor C2 frequencies on the inbound
        and outbound legs.
        5.12.3.3. The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and update
        the crew when the primary radio changes.
        5.12.3.4. One pilot should record and read back all ATC clearances; the flight engineer should
        also record the clearance.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                  43


       5.12.3.5. Both pilots will monitor UHF and VHF guard emergency frequencies to the maximum
       extent possible.
       EXCEPTION: Only one crewmember is required to monitor guard frequencies during tanker or
       receiver rendezvous and AR.
       5.12.3.6. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits the use of unauthorized fre-
       quencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK, or SECURE VOICE training.
   5.12.4. Crew Resource Management (CRM) Assertive Statement “Time Out":
       5.12.4.1. "Time Out" is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers. The use of
       "Time Out" will:
           5.12.4.1.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness.
           5.12.4.1.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
           5.12.4.1.3. Notify all crewmembers when someone sees the aircraft or crew departing from
           established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply uncomfortable with the
           developing conditions.
       5.12.4.2. As soon as possible after a "Time Out" has been called, the aircrew will take the follow-
       ing actions:
           5.12.4.2.1. Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft.
           5.12.4.2.2. The initiating crewmember will voice their concerns to the crew.
           5.12.4.2.3. The PIC will provide all other crewmembers with the opportunity to voice inputs
           relative to the stated concerns.
           5.12.4.2.4. After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the aircrew to continue the current
           course of action or direct a new course of action.

5.13. Transportation of Pets. Transporting pets (dogs and cats) in conjunction with the sponsor’s per-
manent change of station is authorized. Other pets or animals are normally prohibited, but may be moved
according to DoD 4515.13R.

5.14. Alcoholic Beverages. The MAJCOM/A3/DO may authorize the dispensing of alcoholic bever-
ages.

5.15. Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements.
   5.15.1. Refer to Table 5.5. for minimum runway length, minimum runway width, and minimum taxi-
   way width.
44                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


Table 5.5.
Minimum Runway Length (feet) Minimum Runway Width (feet) Minimum Taxiway Width (feet)
                7,000                               147                                  75

     5.15.2. Runway Length for Takeoff and Landing. Do not takeoff if computed critical field length
     exceeds runway available. Minimum runway for a normal landing is landing distance based on a
     threshold crossing height of 50 feet.
        5.15.2.1. Runway Length for Takeoff and Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, the PF will initiate
        takeoffs from the beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway. The decision to make
        intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC.
        5.15.2.2. Pilots may accomplish intersection takeoffs provided the operating environment (i.e.,
        gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather, etc.) allows a safe takeoff and departure. Cal-
        culate takeoff performance based on the runway remaining from the point at which the takeoff is
        initiated. In no case will a takeoff be made from a position where less than 7000 feet of runway
        remains.
        5.15.2.3. During operations on runways partially covered with snow or ice, base takeoff compu-
        tations on the reported runway surface condition (RSC) or runway condition reading (RCR) for
        the cleared portion of the runway. A minimum of 50 feet either side of centerline should be
        cleared. If 50 feet either side of centerline is not cleared, compute takeoff data based on the
        uncleared portion up to 50 feet either side of centerline.
        5.15.2.4. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are available and stressed or authorized for
        normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for takeoff. Departure end
        overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing if needed.
     5.15.3. Arresting Cables.
        5.15.3.1. Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not include recessed
        cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower to have the cable
        inspected.
        5.15.3.2. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as slack, loose,
        or improperly rigged by NOTAM, automated terminal information service (ATIS), or ATC.
     5.15.4. Other Airfield Requirements.
        5.15.4.1. Consult with HQ AMC/A36AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) for suitability guidance.
        Once a mission is executed, the PIC is responsible for determining airfield suitability based upon
        operational need. Airfield certification requirements are detailed in the ASRR.
        5.15.4.2. Aircrews and planning agencies will contact HQ AMC/A36AS for all questions pertain-
        ing to airfield weight bearing capacity and will review the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR before all off-sta-
        tion operations. HQ AMC/A3 is the waiver authority for the restrictions in GDSS/GDSS2 Giant
        Report and ASRR for AMC and AMC-gained aircraft, unless specifically delegated in AFI
        11-2MDS Vol 3 or AMCI 11-208. Direct GDSS/GDSS2 Giant Report and ASRR waiver requests
        to HQ AMC/A36AS. HQ AMC/A37V is the OPR for waivers to airfield restrictions. MAJCOM/
        A3/DO is the waiver authority for non-AMC missions. The PIC is responsible for waiver compli-
        ance. Crews that have access to the World Wide Web will review airfield suitability in the airfield
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 45


       data base via the HQ AMC Aircrew Portal. Consult the ASRR for airfield certification require-
       ments.
   5.15.5. RCR Limitations. When no RCR is available, the PIC will refer to the flight manual for stan-
   dard ICAO conversions based on general runway condition; be conservative when dealing with
   unknown conditions (e.g., forward operating bases (FOBs)). Normally, RCR values are not reported
   for taxiways and ramps. During periods of reported low RCR, the taxiways and ramps may have an
   even lower RCR than reported for the runway. The runway surface should be considered wet when
   water on the runway causes a reflective glare.

5.16. Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage (FOD)
Avoidance.
   5.16.1. Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers monitoring the
   clearance between aircraft and obstruction. With wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 10
   feet. EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, aircraft
   may taxi without marshalers/wing walkers at home station along fixed taxi lines which have been
   measured to ensure a minimum of 10 feet clearance from any obstruction and the obstruction is per-
   manent. Parked aircraft are not considered permanent, and 25 feet of clearance, or a wing walker, is
   required.
   5.16.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are unavail-
   able, deplane one or more crewmembers to maintain obstruction clearance and provide marshaling
   using AFI 11-218 signals. Use wing walkers, deplaned crewmembers, or a crewmember on inter-
   phone positioned at the cabin door(s) to act as an observer while maneuvering on narrow taxiways.
   During night taxi operations, marshalers will have an illuminated wand in each hand. Wing walkers
   are only required to have one illuminated wand. Observers should be in a position to see wing walkers
   at all times (through door or windows) and communicate with the pilot.
   5.16.3. FOD Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD. Crews should:
       5.16.3.1. Carefully review airfield layout paying particular attention to taxi routes, turn require-
       ments, and areas for potential FOD.
       5.16.3.2. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
       5.16.3.3. Where possible, avoid 180° turns. If it becomes necessary to accomplish a 180° turn on
       a narrow runway, the turn should be accomplished at an intersection of a link taxiway or at a des-
       ignated turn around pad.
       5.16.3.4. Where possible, avoid taxi operations that position an engine over an unprepared or
       un-swept surface. If unavoidable, leave the engine in idle (to the maximum extent possible) until
       the engine is over an improved surface.

5.17. Not Used.

5.18. Fuel Jettison Procedures. MAF policy is to avoid fuel jettisons, unless safety of flight dictates an
immediate jettison (as determined by the pilot in command). This does not imply that aircrews should
needlessly bore holes in the sky. In non-emergency situations, emphasis should be placed on finding a
constructive use of the fuel onboard before resorting to fuel jettison.
46                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


     5.18.1. For missions tasked by higher headquarters C2 agencies, the tasking C2 agency may autho-
     rize fuel jettison when an urgent operational requirement dictates immediate recovery and reconstitu-
     tion of the aircraft and/or aircrew. The tasking C2 agency may provide fuel jettison instructions in the
     OPORD, mission directive, SPINS, etc.
     5.18.2. For missions executed from home station, the OG/CC may approve fuel jettisoning when an
     urgent operational requirement exists to expedite recovery/reconstitution of an aircraft and/or aircrew.
     In rare circumstances, it may be reasonable to jettison fuel during rapidly deteriorating weather condi-
     tions.
     5.18.3. For missions not involving emergency situations or operational necessity, the following
     courses of action will be taken when aircraft gross weight exceeds normal landing gross weight limits
     established in technical orders or command directives:
        5.18.3.1. Accomplish continuation training events.
        5.18.3.2. Seek additional receivers through C2 agencies (if applicable).
        5.18.3.3. After exhausting all alternatives, the pilot in command will obtain approval from tasking
        C2 agency (OG/CC for missions executed from home station) to jettison the minimum amount of
        fuel required to land.
     5.18.4. All jettisons will be followed up with a detailed report filed by the PIC immediately after
     landing (utilize AMC IMT 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence Worksheet).
     Submit AMC IMT 97 through unit OGV to AMC/A37V. Unit OGV will retain AMC IMT 97 for 6
     months. Document all pertinent information, including the following items:
        5.18.4.1. Scheduled duration.
        5.18.4.2. Actual duration.
        5.18.4.3. Landing gross weight.
        5.18.4.4. Computed stopping distance.
        5.18.4.5. Recovery field.
        5.18.4.6. Runway available.
        5.18.4.7. Jettison altitude/location.
        5.18.4.8. Jettison amount.
        5.18.4.9. Reason for jettison.
        5.18.4.10. Approval authority.
     5.18.5. OG/CCs will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel jettison-
     ing. Ideally, establish jettison areas at altitudes above 20,000 feet above ground level, off published
     airways, avoiding urban areas, agricultural regions, and water supply sources. Initiate AF IMT 813,
     Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, and submit it to the base environmental coordinator.

5.19. Aircraft Speed. Comply with requirements established in AFI 11-202V3. In accordance with
applicable tech orders, aircraft may exceed 250 KIAS or in-flight minimum maneuver speed below
10,000 feet to safely accomplish formation departure rejoins. Once rejoined, all formation members may
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                  47


exceed 250 KIAS below 10,000 feet only to accommodate the minimum maneuver speed of the heaviest
formation member.

5.20. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are centralized unit
efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a consolidated course of action. As
a minimum, unit commanders must implement the following procedures:
   5.20.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions.
       5.20.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions.
       5.20.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate - Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed only when
       departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local IFR/VFR traffic pattern activity is pro-
       hibited.
       5.20.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe - All takeoffs and landings are prohibited. Waiver author-
       ity is local OG/CC or equivalent. Parent MAJCOM/A3/DO waiver is required to operate at air-
       fields not controlled by the MAF.
   5.20.2. Commanders establish Phase II of the BASH program during increased periods of migratory
   bird activity. Schedulers shall make every effort to not schedule takeoffs, landings, and low-levels
   from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the Phase II period. Publish signifi-
   cant bird hazards in FLIP Area Planning (AP) and the IFR Supplement along with the associated air-
   field operating hour restrictions and avoidance instructions.
   5.20.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, a PIC has the authority to delay
   takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition after coordinating with the appropriate C2 authority.
   5.20.4. Consider bird migratory patterns during the en route portion of the mission to help minimize
   the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on HQ AFSC/SEF website
   contains BASH information including regionalized Continental United States (CONUS) bird migra-
   tion patterns, Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) software overlay, and the latest news. The
   Avian Hazard Advisory system (AHAS) website is another source for real time bird hazard informa-
   tion. Both sites may be accessed through the AMC aircrew mission planning portal. See AFPAM
   91-212, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques, for additional information.
   5.20.5. Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit, or as practicable,
   to have the aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. Bird strike damage cannot be accu-
   rately assessed in-flight, and undetected damage may result in a complex airborne emergency; only
   qualified maintenance personnel, on the ground, can make reliable damage assessments.

5.21. Functional Check Flights (FCFs) and Acceptance Check Flights (ACFs). FCFs and ACFs will
be accomplished IAW AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Management, T.O. 1-1-300,
Functional Check Flights and Maintenance Operational Checks, and T.O. 1C-10(K)A-6CF-1, Accep-
tance and/or Functional Check Procedures Manual. Crews should only perform tasks or functions con-
tained in specific technical order guidance. If requested to perform a non-standard function, PICs should
contact their OG/CC to see if an FCF applies.
   5.21.1. FCF Restrictions. See T.O. 1-1-300.
       5.21.1.1. The OG/CC, or deployed equivalent, may authorize temporary waivers to FCF proce-
       dures for aircrew qualification when operationally necessary.
48                                                  AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


       5.21.1.2. The OG/CC is responsible for the wing FCF program. Publish additional guidance in
       local supplement to this instruction. The OG/CC may authorize a partial FCF to check only those
       systems disturbed by maintenance, an inspection or modification.
       5.21.1.3. Conduct check flights within the designated check flight airspace of the base from
       which the flight was launched except when the flight must be conducted under specific conditions,
       not compatible with local conditions and area restrictions.
       5.21.1.4. The decision to approve a combined FCF and ferry flight is the responsibility of the
       MAJCOM/A3/DO.
       5.21.1.5. The OG/CC will only certify highly experienced instructors as FCF crewmembers. The
       OG/CC will determine FCF crew complement after a thorough ORM assessment for that specific
       FCF flight.
       5.21.1.6. Ideally, conduct FCFs in daylight, VMC. OG/CCs may authorize a flight under a com-
       bination of VMC and IMC. Begin the flight in VMC. If the aircraft and all systems are operating
       properly, the crew may proceed IFR through cloud cover to “VFR on Top” for the altitude phase
       of the flight.
       5.21.1.7. If a malfunction occurs during a FCF, the MXG/CC may subsequently release the air-
       craft for flight providing the malfunction is not related to the condition generating the FCF, and
       the original condition operationally checked good.
       5.21.1.8. The OG/CC or deployed MC may authorize temporary waivers to FCF procedures for
       aircrew qualification when operationally necessary. Permanent waivers require MAJCOM/A3/
       DO approval IAW Chapter 1.

5.22. Participation in Aerial Events. See AFI 11-209, Air Force Participation in Aerial Events, and the
appropriate MAJCOM supplement. Aerial events must be sanctioned and individually approved by the
appropriate military authority, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). AFI 11-209 and AMC
Supp 1 clearly identifies events sanctioned for support, and specifies the approval authority for each type,
AFI 11-209 also stipulates that units participating in aerial events will ensure activities are coordinated
with the FAA through the regional Air Force representative.

5.23. Terminal Area RNAV Procedures. Properly trained KC-10 aircrews are permitted to fly RNAV,
and RNAV (GPS) departures, arrivals, and approaches. Departures, arrivals, and approaches flown using
GPS or RNAV must be retrieved from the navigation database. Approaches will not be flown with an
expired database. RNAV and RNAV (GPS) approaches will be flown only to LNAV minima. For depar-
ture and arrival procedures based on traditional ground-based navaids, FMS nav mode may be used as the
sole source for navigation. Underlying navigational aids must be displayed and monitored.

5.24. Traffic Alerting and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). It is imperative to follow resolution
advisories (RAs) to obtain aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to follow the computed RA
may increase the probability of a midair collision. Pilots who deviate from an ATC clearance in response
to an RA shall notify ATC of the deviation as soon as practical and promptly return to the ATC clearance
when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new clearance.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                               49


5.25. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews will not normally attempt to recover an
aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi; ground crews will accom-
plish aircraft recovery. Unless an emergency dictates otherwise, aircrews may only accomplish recovery
if there is no aircraft damage, the surface will support the aircraft, and the PIC has coordinated with
appropriate MAJCOM headquarters maintenance authorities through TACC, or appropriate C2 agency.

6.5. Airfield Review. Aircrews will consult the web-based airfield database maintained by HQ AMC/
A36AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) and comply with the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR for updates to airfield
operability and weight bearing capability.

6.6. Aircrew Intelligence Briefing. Aircrews will receive an intelligence briefing that will emphasize
terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and military development in the area in which they will be flying.
Obtain timely intelligence updates prior to entering a specific area of operations (AOR). In theater, air-
crews should receive intelligence updates on initial arrival at a forward operating location (FOL), or en
route stop, and thereafter when significant developments occur. Report information of possible intelli-
gence value to the local intelligence office as soon as practical to ensure timely dissemination of mission
reports (MISREPs).

6.12. Briefing Requirements.
   6.12.1. Pre-Departure Briefing Items. The PIC will contact the local C2 agency to confirm mission
   requirements. The PIC and controlling agency jointly share responsibility to identify special briefing
   requirements. Briefings may include buffer zone, electronic warfare activities, SAFE PASSAGE,
   Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), diplomatic clearance, hazardous cargo, anti-hijacking proce-
   dures, operations and safety supplements to flight manuals, and OPORD procedure.
   6.12.2. Pilot in Command Briefing. Cover all applicable items of the operations briefing, including
   MAJCOM, NAF, and unit special interest items (SIIs), and ORM risks/levels/mitigating factors. Brief
   crewmembers on the specific mission details if not previously accomplished. Use a MAJCOM
   approved briefing guide.
      6.12.2.1. In the en route system, the PIC will ensure that an aircrew briefing is conducted prior to
      the first sortie of the day. As a minimum, brief crewmembers on specific mission details for that
      day's sortie(s) and the ORM risks/levels/mitigating factors for the mission. Complete this briefing
      prior to engine start.
   6.12.3. Specialized Briefing. Use specialized briefings to detail operating procedures or SIIs peculiar
   to various crew positions, and to answer questions relating to those specialties. Specialized briefings
56                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


     review formation tactics and procedures, AR information, and technical instructions for specialized
     equipment operations. All crewmembers should attend each briefing. Crewmembers may only be
     excused from specialized briefings for pre-flight duties, however the PIC will back brief all appropri-
     ate items. Use a MAJCOM approved specialized briefing guide.
     6.12.4. Weather Briefings. The PIC will obtain a briefing on current weather, trends, and forecast for
     the proposed route, destination, and alternates. The PIC will brief primary crewmembers on appropri-
     ate weather conditions before departure.
        6.12.4.1. Aircrews flying flight-managed sorties will use the weather briefing provided with the
        IFM aircrew departure papers. Local weather flights/agencies may update local takeoff weather
        data, but aircrews, working through their flight manager/dispatcher, will use TACC weather oper-
        ations (or the Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) supporting the theater AMOCC) as the final
        arbiter for weather-related issues and further updates.
        6.12.4.2. On sorties not planned by a flight manager, crews should obtain weather information
        from their local weather flight or the OWS responsible for weather support at their location.
        6.12.4.3. If adequate services are not available, and the crew cannot contact their home weather
        flight, OWS, or TACC weather operations, obtain weather through any means available prior to
        mission accomplishment.
        6.12.4.4. Weather information is permitted from US Military weather services, any
        FAA-approved weather source, or any host nation civil or military weather source.
        6.12.4.5. Verbal weather briefings are authorized for local flights. Face-to-face briefings are not
        required.
     6.12.5. Buffer Zone. Prior to operating an aircraft within, or adjacent to, an established buffer zone,
     the PIC will ensure primary crewmembers are briefed on current buffer zone procedures outlined in
     appropriate directives.
     6.12.6. Peacetime and Wartime SAFE PASSAGE Procedures. Pilots must be familiar with peacetime
     and wartime safe passage of friendly military aircraft.
     6.12.7. IFM Briefing. PICs will thoroughly review the aircrew departure papers provided for IFM
     sorties. When time and circumstances permit, the PIC, or designated representative, will contact the
     flight manager before signing the flight plan.

6.13. Call Signs.
     6.13.1. Training Missions. Aircraft will use the unit static call sign prefix followed by a 2-digit suffix
     assigned by the parent unit.
     6.13.2. Operational Missions. Use call signs assigned by OPORD, FRAG, or diplomatic clearance. If
     no call sign has been assigned, use unit static call signs. When flying AMC missions, and no other call
     sign has been assigned, use the “REACH” call sign followed by the last digit of the year the aircraft
     was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft tail number (or as required by diplomatic clearance). To
     complete flight plans, put the letters "RCH" followed by the last digit of the year the aircraft was built
     and the last 3 digits of the aircraft tail number.
     6.13.3. The Reach 01 and 18 call signs are reserved for the AMC/CC and 18 AF/CC.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 57


   6.13.4. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). For actual AE missions, use the call sign “Evac" followed by
   the five-digit aircraft number (example, Evac 12345) or mission designator. Refer to FLIP GP Chap-
   ter 4. When the AE portion of the mission is completed, normal call signs will be used. This does not
   alleviate the responsibility to use diplomatically cleared call signs when required.

6.14. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent possible
without unacceptable mission degradation.

6.15. Flight Plan/Data Verification.
   6.15.1. Computer Flight Plan (CFP) Use. CFPs are the official sources of performance, navigation,
   and climatic data, including en route wind information. If stand-alone computer based plans are used,
   each mission segment should utilize best wind data available. Only current, command validated (HQ
   AMC/A37V) computer programs will be used for flights involving KC-10 aircraft.
       6.15.1.1. Use CFPs to the maximum extent practical. Flight crews may manually compute flight
       plans. The PIC has final responsibility for flight plan accuracy and diplomatic clearance compli-
       ance.
       6.15.1.2. Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure. Pass
       any flight plan discrepancies to the C2 flight planning office. On flight-managed sorties, promptly
       notify the flight manager of any flight plan discrepancies, to ensure the correct route of flight is
       filed with air traffic control. Identify inaccurate CFP winds to TACC/XOCZF if the average wind
       for a route segment exceeds either 30° error in direction or 25 knots in speed.

6.16. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1, Instrument Flight Procedures, this
chapter, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Regardless of the type of departure flown (IFR/
VFR), review the following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedure, instrument approach procedures,
NOTAMS, GDSS, Giant Report, and suitable terrain charts. All performance data will be computed by
the flight engineer using T.0. 1C-10(K)A-1-1 or authorized computer software and checked by the pilot,
or another qualified flight engineer, using T.0. 1C-10(K)A-1-1 or T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1CL-2. Regardless of
the method in which data is computed, it will be verified using a different method.
   6.16.1. VFR Departures.
NOTE: VFR departures will not be flown in lieu of obstacle clearance planning.
       6.16.1.1. VFR departures are authorized when there is no authorized IFR departure method for
       the airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure methods contained in
       AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, when operational requirements dictate (i.e. tactical neces-
       sity), or when most of the mission is planned as a VFR flight for training. VFR departures require
       detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain are avoided.
       6.16.1.2. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by ensuring all the
       following conditions are met:
          6.16.1.2.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the departure route.
          6.16.1.2.2. One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb capability shall ensure departure or emer-
          gency return route provides obstacle avoidance.

NOTE: If unable to comply with any of the above conditions, download cargo/fuel or delay until condi-
tions that are more favorable exist.
        6.16.1.3. Refer to FLIP for host nation VFR requirements before flying VFR outside of CONUS.
        6.16.1.4. When departing VFR, maintain VFR cloud clearances until obtaining an IFR clearance
        or reaching the IFR MEA.
     6.16.2. IFR Departures: Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as outlined in AFI
     11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1.
        6.16.2.1. If the airport does not have an authorized IFR departure method, depart VFR IAW para-
        graph 6.16.1. An IFR departure is not authorized at airfields without an instrument approach.
        6.16.2.2. IFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain are
        avoided. Adhere to screen height/departure end of runway (DER) requirements for IFR departure
        planning (AFMAN 11-217V1).
NOTE: Screen height requirements for departures depend on the agency that wrote the departure and/or
the airfield where the departure is being flown. There is no standard or easy way for crews to determine
screen height requirements. Therefore, when using departures other than those listed below, or when any
doubt exists about which screen height to use, plan to cross the DER at 35 feet (minimum) unless you can
ascertain a different screen height requirement from an appropriate authority.
           6.16.2.2.1. Special Departure Procedure: Published on SDP.
           6.16.2.2.2. USAF/USN produced SID or USAF/USN/USMC airfield: Zero feet or as pub-
           lished.
           6.16.2.2.3. US Army, FAA SID, and Joint Use Airfield within the US: 35 feet or as published.
           6.16.2.2.4. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Military Airports: 35 feet or as pub-
           lished.
           6.16.2.2.5. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Civil Airports: 16 feet or as published.
           6.16.2.2.6. Other ICAO nations: 16 feet or as published.
           6.16.2.2.7. All others: 35 feet or as published.
        6.16.2.3. Aircraft must meet the published climb gradient for the departure runway with all
        engines operating. If no minimum climb gradient is published, 200 ft/nm will be used.
NOTE: In the event the aircraft is unable to meet the published ALL ENGINE climb gradient, download
cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable conditions exist.
        6.16.2.4. The following methods are provided to ensure the aircraft can vertically clear all obsta-
        cles along the planned departure route with OEI:
           6.16.2.4.1. Special Departure Procedure (SDP). SDPs are MDS-specific OEI escape proce-
           dures intended only for emergency use. They are applicable after the loss of an engine and,
           where available, will be used for engine-out departure planning. Retrieve current SDPs from
           the Jeppesen AFOpsdata website: http://www.jeppesen.com.
               6.16.2.4.1.1. ‘Ad hoc’ requests for fields not currently listed on the website may be
               requested through OGV NLT 48 hrs prior to scheduled departure. Aircrew members will
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                               59


              not make Ad Hoc requests directly to Jeppesen or through the Jeppesen website. All Ad
              Hoc requests must be reviewed by HQ AMC/A37V for validation. HQ AMC/A37V will
              forward valid Ad Hoc requests to Jeppesen for positing to the SDP website. HQ AMC/
              A37V authorizes the use of Ad Hoc SDPs for a maximum of 7 days after the analysis date.
              The SDP analysis date is located in the upper left-hand corner of the takeoff performance
              sheet.
           6.16.2.4.2. Minimum climb gradient. The TERPS standard minimum climb gradient is 200 ft/
           nm, which is based on the standard obstacle clearance surface (OCS) of 152 ft/nm plus the
           required obstacle clearance (ROC) of 48 ft/nm. If an SDP is not available, the crew must
           ensure compliance with any obstacle-based minimum climb gradients for the selected depar-
           ture, or 200 ft/nm (whichever is higher), with one-engine inoperative. Minimum climb gradi-
           ents may be published as a ‘Trouble T’ restriction in the IFR Take-off Minimums section of
           FLIP or on a SID. When required for mission accomplishment, crews may subtract 48’/nm
           from published climb gradients before computing engine-out takeoff data. When using this
           procedure, the lowest allowable climb gradient is 152 ft/nm. Minimum climb gradients do not
           take into account low, close in obstacles (obstacles or terrain 200’ AGL and below) which
           should normally be published as a NOTE on the SID or IFR departure procedure (Trouble T).
           Crews must also ensure the aircraft can clear these obstacles by computing the climb gradient
           for the obstacles and comparing it to the climb gradient calculated for the climb restriction.
           6.16.2.4.3. Vertically clear all obstacles. NOTE: Use of the provisions of this paragraph
           requires prior approval from OG/CC, or deployed equivalent.
              6.16.2.4.3.1. When departing locations where neither an SDP nor a minimum climb
              restriction exists, and operational requirements dictate, crews may use obstacle height and
              distance to obstacle/screen height to determine the minimum Gross Climb Gradient
              (GCG), IAW TO 1C-10(K)A-1-1. The PIC must provide all significant obstacle height/
              distance and screen height information to the flight engineer. A significant obstacle is
              defined as any obstacle along the planned departure route which penetrates the 2.5 GCG
              on the performance manual climbout flight path charts. In the absence of significant obsta-
              cles or screen heights, compute TOLD using a minimum 2.5 GCG IAW TO
              1C-10(K)A-1-1.
WARNING: 2.5 GCG does not equate to a 2.5% climb gradient. Because KC-10 climbout is not linear,
obstacles which fall below the 40:1 OCS may penetrate the 2.5 GCG line and are therefore limiting for
engine out takeoff planning. Detailed information about obstacles below the OCS is not published and is
generally not available. When using this procedure, the PIC must thoroughly review all available
resources to include properly updated terrain charts (TPC, Sectional, JOG), FLIP, base operations, local
TERPS specialist (USAF base), or other TERPS authorities (Naval Flight Information Group (NAVFIG)
in Washington, D.C., DSN 288-3486, commercial (202) 433-3486; Army’s TERPS office, DSN
656-4410, commercial (703) 806-4410; FAA office in Oklahoma City, OK, commercial (405) 954-4787.)
NOTE: If the requirements of 6.16.2.4. cannot be met, download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable
conditions exist.

6.17. Weather Minimums for Takeoff. For RVR less than 1600, takeoffs are permitted provided the
runway has dual RVR readouts and displays (minimum touchdown RVR 1200 and minimum rollout RVR
60                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


1000), runway centerline lighting is operational, and both pilots are fully qualified in their respective crew
position. If any of the above criteria is not met, minimum RVR is 1600 on all RVR readouts.
     6.17.1. When weather is below landing minimums, a departure alternate is required (see paragraph
     6.19.).
     6.17.2. If no RVR readout is available for the departure runway, visibility must be reported to be 1/2
     mile (800 meters).

6.18. Alternate Planning. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3. Choose
alternates that best meet mission requirements and conserve fuel; they should not be within the same ter-
minal area, if terminal forecasts are marginal. Select alternates that are not restricted by FLIP, FCG, or
diplomatic clearances, and are compatible with the mission load and performance characteristics of the
aircraft. The PIC retains final authority in the choice of alternates; however, selection by support agencies
normally should be used if they meet the above criteria and the aircraft has already been serviced.

6.19. Departure Alternates.
     6.19.1. A departure alternate is required if weather is below landing minimums for the available
     approach (at departure aerodrome).
     6.19.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the aircraft must
     be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude (MOCA), whichever
     is higher, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria. To qualify as a departure alternate, the air-
     field must meet one of the following conditions:
        6.19.2.1. For an alternate within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather must be equal to or
        better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1 hour after takeoff,
        but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400), or;
        6.19.2.2. For an alternate within two hours flying time, the existing weather must be at least 500-1
        above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but not less than 600-2 for a preci-
        sion approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to remain so for 1 hour after
        ETA at the alternate.

6.20. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will be accord-
ing to AFI 11-202V3 and the following:
     6.20.1. File two alternates when:
        6.20.1.1. The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for the available
        DoD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) precision approach.
        6.20.1.2. The forecast ceiling OR visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for
        all other approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement (for example Jeppesen
        approaches), the minimum required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published HAA or
        HAT and rounding it up to the nearest one hundred feet (or as determined by MAJCOM TERPs
        review). For example, a Jeppesen VOR approach with a published HAA of 642 feet would require
        a forecasted ceiling of 700 feet.
        6.20.1.3. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected for RCR.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                  61


   6.20.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the departure or destination aerodrome
   is outside the CONUS.
   6.20.3. When filing to a remote or island destination, aircrews may use an additional 1 + 15 holding
   fuel (in lieu of an alternate). The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the
   following criteria:
      6.20.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA and
      forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and
      6.20.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published mini-
      mums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a precision
      approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-precision approach
      minimums (excluding ASR), but not below precision approach minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours).
      NOTE: See Chapter 14 for fuel planning considerations to a remote or island destination, or a
      destination where the alternate is located in Alaska or at latitudes greater than 59°N.

6.21. Adverse Weather.
   6.21.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
      6.21.1.1. Crews should confirm the type of aircraft the forecast turbulence applies to, or what type
      of aircraft reported the encounter, to gain a more accurate picture for their route of flight. The
      KC-10 is a category III aircraft for turbulence.
      6.21.1.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts fastened,
      when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated. WARNING: Serious
      injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened and the aircraft encounters
      moderate or severe turbulence.
   6.21.2. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged operation, such
   as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided. NOTE: Air Force Weather
   Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is
   equivalent to moderate icing and freezing rain is equivalent to severe icing.
      6.21.2.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain. Do not takeoff under conditions of
      freezing drizzle except when aircraft has been properly de-iced/anti-iced IAW flight manual pro-
      cedures.
      6.21.2.2. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures near 0°C, may cause ice or
      frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When an aircraft requires de-icing/anti-icing prior to take-
      off, refer to the following:
          6.21.2.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in their respective flight
          manual. Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all restrictions in their associated flight
          manual with respect to anti-ice/de-ice procedures and holdover times.
          6.21.2.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids do not provide any anti-icing ben-
          efit, and therefore do not have holdover times. As a guide, for approved anti-icing fluids,
          crews may use published anti-icing holdover times IAW TO 42C-1-2, Aircraft Anti-icing Pro-
          cedures, and AFFSA holdover tables located at the HQ AFFSA website. The holdover time
62                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


            begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and the PIC shall use time, temperature, and dilu-
            tion of mixture to determine when times are exceeded and re-apply fluid if required.
            6.21.2.2.3. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is completed within
            5 minutes of departure.
     6.21.3. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds. If
     unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2000 feet, avoid them by
     at least:
        6.21.3.1. 20 NMs at or above flight level FL230.
        6.21.3.2. 10 NMs below FL230.
CAUTION: Aircraft damage may occur 20NMs or more from any thunderstorms. Aircrews must famil-
iarize themselves with information on thunderstorm development and hazards. Refer to AFH 11-203,
Weather for Aircrews.
     6.21.4. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be used to
     assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather. It should never be consid-
     ered a normal avoidance procedure. When relying exclusively on ground-based radar for weather
     avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance instructions, attempt to maintain
     VMC by:
        6.21.4.1. Changing routing.
        6.21.4.2. Diverting to alternate.
        6.21.4.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.
     6.21.5. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and advected
     clouds (horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of thunderstorms.
     6.21.6. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or departing an air-
     port in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
        6.21.6.1. Attempt to maintain VMC.
        6.21.6.2. Maintain at least 5NMs separation from heavy rain showers
        6.21.6.3. Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e., clouds within plus or minus 5,000 feet of
        the freezing level or plus or minus 8°C of the freezing level.
NOTE: Approaches or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within 10NMs provid-
ing they are not producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds, gusts fronts,
heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and are not forecast or observed to be moving in the
direction of the route of flight (to include the planned missed approach corridor, if applicable).
     6.21.7. When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C or below,
     refer to the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) Section D, Temperature Correction Chart, to correct
     MDA, DH, and other altitudes inside the FAF.
     6.21.8. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave turbulence.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 63


   6.21.9. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET). National Weather Service in-flight
   weather advisories are not limiting to Air Force aircraft. Contact the nearest military weather facility
   or flight service station for details, if applicable.
   6.21.10. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Aircraft flight operations in areas of forecast or known volcanic
   activity or dust is prohibited. Plan all missions to avoid volcanic activity by at least 20 NMs.
   6.21.11. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most conducive to lightning strikes and
   prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
       6.21.11.1. Within 8°C of the freezing level.
       6.21.11.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with thunder-
       storm activity.

6.22. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a logic based, common sense approach to mak-
ing calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during, and after all oper-
ations. USAF policy on ORM is contained in Air Force Policy Directive 90-9, Operational Risk
Management. PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and local guidance as part of pre-
flight activities.

Section 6C—Preflight

6.23. AFTO Forms 781 Series.
   6.23.1. Review AFTO Forms 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or operating aircraft
   systems. An exceptional release must be signed before flight. A maintenance officer, maintenance
   superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the exceptional release. If one of these individu-
   als is not available, the PIC may sign the exceptional release. Ensure that the DD1896, DoD Fuel
   Identaplate, and AIR card are aboard the aircraft.
   6.23.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition that
   might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to another sta-
   tion. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies,
   and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. AFRC crews also see AFI 11-202V3/
   AFRCSUP1. After the maintenance release is obtained, coordinate mission requirements with the
   controlling agency. The PIC’s concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown.
   6.23.3. For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support refer to paragraph
   12.3.

6.24. Not Used.

6.25. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base (MOB). The PIC is responsible for ensur-
ing the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent mission tasking. If qualified maintenance specialists are
unavailable, the aircrew is responsible for turning the aircraft to meet subsequent mission tasking.
   6.25.1. The PIC is responsible for the recovery items including:
       6.25.1.1. Parking and receiving.
       6.25.1.2. Aircraft servicing, including Aircraft Ground Equipment (AGE) usage.
64                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


        6.25.1.3. Supervision of minor maintenance within local capability.
        6.25.1.4. Minor configuration changes to meet mission tasking.
        6.25.1.5. Securing the aircraft before entering crew rest.
        6.25.1.6. Coordinating aircraft security requirements.
        6.25.1.7. Documenting AFTO 781-series forms.
     6.25.2. In all cases where aircrews must service the aircraft without qualified maintenance specialist
     assistance, comply with the appropriate maintenance T.O.
     6.25.3. Aircrews are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections. In those instances
     where maintenance personnel are not available, the aircrew will enter a red dash symbol in the AFTO
     Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance Document, updating current status
     and enter a red dash symbol and a discrepancy that reflects that the applicable maintenance inspection
     (i.e. preflight, thru-flight, basic post-flight) is overdue.

6.26. Life Support Requirements.
     6.26.1. Oxygen. For flights where the total number of individuals on board the aircraft does not
     exceed the total number of operational flight crew oxygen system stations (maximum 11), the mini-
     mum quantity of oxygen aboard an aircraft before takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the
     planned flight from the equal time point (ETP) to recovery should oxygen be required. Calculate using
     the 100 percent oxygen chart in the flight manual.
        6.26.1.1. When the crew bunks are occupied in flight, crewmembers will have a portable oxygen
        walk-around bottle with quick-don mask, or Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS)
        readily available for use in the event of an emergency.

6.27. Fleet Service. Ensure the required fleet service items are aboard the aircraft early enough to permit
inventory prior to engine start.

6.28. Cargo Documentation. Proper cargo or mail documentation will accompany each load.
     6.28.1. Load Data Information (Applicable to AFRC/ANG completing TACC-directed mission). At
     stations where there is no mobility air transportation function, the aircrew will collect the required
     load information on each leg, and submit it to the first station, which has such a function. The report
     will be submitted on AF IMT 4075, Aircraft Load Data Worksheet.

6.29. Airlifting Hazardous Cargo.
     6.29.1. AMCH 11-214, AMC Aircrew Hazardous Material Handbook, contains a description of the
     types and classes of hazardous cargo that may be carried. PICs are responsible for ensuring that all
     procedures contained in AMCH 11-214 are complied with when airlifting hazardous cargo on AMC
     missions.
        6.29.1.1. For more information regarding hazardous materials, refer to AFMAN 24-204, Prepar-
        ing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment.

      areas. Approach, landing, and takeoff tracks are excluded.
      6.29.2.3. Prepare a departure message at stations when a C2 center is not available. The remarks
      section of the departure message will include: Class of hazardous material, DoD class or division
      for explosives, net explosive weight (NEW), and gross weight. If required, request special han-
      dling (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical escort teams, etc.).
      6.29.2.4. If estimated time en route (ETE) is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances preclude
      timely message receipt at destination, notify the next destination of the ETA and information
      listed in paragraph 6.29.2.3. If available, C2 will relay required information to next destination.

6.30. Handling of Classified Cargo, Registered Mail, Mission Capable (MICAP) Parts, Very, Very
Important Part (VVIP), Forward Supply System (FSS) Shipments, and Courier Material.

     notify the local US military commander or US Government activity.
     6.30.4. Life or death urgency shipments consist of biological or other medical supplies of such
     urgency that human life is dependent upon immediate receipt. Shipments will be manifested sepa-
     rately and the manifest annotated with the words LIFE OR DEATH URGENCY. All shipments will
     be handled on a hand-to-hand receipt basis, using either the air cargo manifest or the DD1907, Signa-
     ture and Tally Record, for unit moves. The PIC, or designated representative, will be briefed on the
     urgency of the shipment and be made the custodian during flight.

Section 6D—Departure

6.31. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are on time if the aircraft is airborne within -20/+14 min-
utes of scheduled takeoff time or as specified in a MAJCOM supplement.
     6.31.1. AR Missions. Scheduled takeoff time may be adjusted to make good the ARCT. Notify C2
     agency before takeoff to adjust the scheduled takeoff time.
     6.31.2. Early Departures. Early departures are authorized to prevent a delay due to weather, ATC
     restrictions, airfield or aircraft operational limitations, to adjust mission flow during a large-scale
     operation, or if approved through C2 channels provided the impact on local and downrange facilities
     and crew duty is evaluated.

6.32. Not Used.

Section 6E—En route

6.33. Flight Progress. In-flight, use all available navigational aids to monitor FMS performance. Imme-
diately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability that degrades centerline accuracy to the
controlling air route traffic control center (ARTCC).
     6.33.1. Another pilot or primary crewmember will verify waypoint data inserted into the FMS. Check
     both the coordinate information and the distances between waypoints against the flight plan.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                   67


6.34. Not Used.

6.35. CIRVIS and Other Reports. Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as indicated in
FLIP planning or FLIP En route Supplement.
   6.35.1. In-flight harassment or hostile action against aircraft. Aircraft subjected to harassment or hos-
   tile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF air and ground voice facility
   and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type, insignia, or any other identifying features;
   note position, heading, time, speed when harassed, and the type of harassment. Request relay of the
   report to the nearest C2 agency. Also, attempt to contact the nearest command post when in UHF and
   VHF range.
   6.35.2. Other incidents will be reported as indicated in AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting.

6.36. In-Flight Meals. Pilots should not eat meals at the same time, and their meals should consist of dif-
ferent menu items.

6.37. Communications.
   6.37.1. Crews should conduct an HF radio ground check before takeoff if use of the HF radio may be
   required for ATC or C2 communications. Attempt to establish HF contact before going out of UHF/
   VHF range. If unable to establish HF contact with the controlling HF station, and an alternate means
   of relay of ATC information is not available, the aircraft should return to the nearest suitable support
   base.
   6.37.2. Pilots shall provide ARTCC position and weather observations when required. If unable to
   contact an ATC agency, attempt to relay through the GLOBAL HF stations.

6.38. In-flight Emergency Procedures. The PIC shall report deviations from directives that may occur
as a result of an emergency according to AFI 11-202V3. Time and conditions permitting, inform passen-
gers of the situation and intentions.
   6.38.1. Notification of C2 Agencies. When practical after completing the aircraft emergency action
   checklists and associated actions, the PIC shall furnish ATC and appropriate C2 agencies with a
   description of the difficulty, assistance required, intentions, and any other pertinent information.
   6.38.2. The PIC may initiate a CONFERENCE HOTEL/SKYHOOK when additional expertise is
   necessary. Communications procedures are as follow:
       6.38.2.1. Local Area. Use appropriate UHF or VHF frequencies.
       6.38.2.2. En route. Attempt to establish a phone patch with the nearest or controlling C2 Center
       using global HF network, UHF/VHF stations, satcom, etc. If unable, aircrews are permitted to use
       ARINC radio service as an additional avenue for phone patch connectivity.
       6.38.2.3. Provide the following information when time permits:
           6.38.2.3.1. Description of the situation to include actions taken and intentions.
           6.38.2.3.2. What assistance is being requested.
           6.38.2.3.3. Fuel on board and hours of endurance.

            6.38.2.3.4. Position.
            6.38.2.3.5. Altitude and flight conditions.
            6.38.2.3.6. Number of personnel and DVs on board.
            6.38.2.3.7. Qualification of PIC.
            6.38.2.3.8. Planned landing destination and ETA.

6.39. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care, the PIC
will notify the station of intended landing in sufficient time so the aircraft may be met by medical person-
nel. Notification will include the patient’s sex, approximate age, and major complaint.

6.40. Weather Forecasts. It is the pilot’s responsibility to obtain destination weather prior to descent.
The primary sources are TACC weather operations, OWSs, and USAF weather flights via pilot-to-mete-
orologist service (PMSV) or through a USAF aeronautical station. For aircraft flying in EUCOM AOR
(ENAME operations) contact USAFE/OWS at Sembach AB GE. SOUTHCOM AOR contact 25 OWS at
Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ. The ATC system can provide weather information to en route aircraft.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.41. Descent. Before descent into unfamiliar areas, pilots will review appropriate terrain charts to
increase aircrew situational awareness of obstructions. Primary crewmembers will not be involved in
duties other than aircraft operations, descent and approach monitoring, and required checklist items from
the initial descent point to landing.
     6.41.1. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at night or
     during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available approved instru-
     ment approach.
        6.41.1.1. A visual approach may be flown during night VFR conditions if an approved instrument
        approach to the landing runway is not available or operational missions require a tactical
        approach. NOTE: A visual glide slope indicator, VASI, PAPI, etc., is required.
        6.41.1.2. On training/evaluation flights, pilots may fly non-precision approaches or VFR traffic
        patterns to accomplish required training and evaluations. The pilot not flying will monitor a preci-
        sion approach when practical to enhance safety.
        6.41.1.3. For recovery at home station, pilots may elect to fly a visual or non-precision approach,
        if weather minimums permit.

6.42. Instrument Approach Procedures.
     6.42.1. Pilots will ensure their aircraft can meet or exceed all climb gradients specified in the missed
     approach procedure, or 200’/nm if none published, with one engine inoperative. The climb gradient
     chart (Figure 12-30) of T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1-1 may be used to verify missed approach climb capability.
     Convert climb gradients in feet/nm to percent by dividing by 60. If unable to meet required climb gra-
     dients, pilots must coordinate alternate missed approach procedures with ATC, which will ensure ter-
     rain clearance prior to commencing the approach. If this is not possible, do not attempt the approach.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                              69


  Prior to starting an instrument approach, OEI missed approach climb capability will be verified if any
  of the following conditions are present:
     6.42.1.1. SMOE greater than 1.07.
     6.42.1.2. Gross weight greater than 400,000 lbs.
     6.42.1.3. Published missed approach climb gradient exceeds 200’/nm.
  6.42.2. Weather minimums. Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an en route
  descent, pilots will confirm the existing weather is reported to be:
     6.42.2.1. At or above required visibility for straight-in or sidestep approaches.
         6.42.2.1.1. For PAR approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 2400 (730 meters) or 1/
         2 mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR readout available.
     6.42.2.2. At or above required ceiling and visibility for circling approaches.
         6.42.2.2.1. For circling approaches with no published ceiling requirement, the required ceil-
         ing shall be computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 feet rounded up to the next one
         hundred foot value. (For example, if the HAA is 747 feet, add 100 feet to get 847 feet and then
         round up to the next one hundred foot value which would be 900 feet. Your ceiling for the
         approach must be at or above 900 feet.) When circling minimums are published, but not by
         category, circling approach minimums will be as published, but in no case lower than 600 feet
         and 2 miles visibility.
     6.42.2.3. Increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument approach by 1/2 SM or as
     noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the runway approach lighting system
     (ALS) is inoperative. (This applies only to the ALS itself, not to VASIs, PAPIs, and other lights
     that are not a component of the ALS.)
  6.42.3. Category I ILS Procedures. Decision height for precision approaches will be as published, but
  no lower than 200 feet height above touchdown (HAT).
     6.42.3.1. ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches. Both pilots must be certified to
     conduct an ILS PRM approach. Refer to AFI 11-2KC10V1 for certification procedures. Comply
     with the following operational procedures:
         6.42.3.1.1. Two operational VHF communication radios are required.
         6.42.3.1.2. The approach must be briefed as an ILS PRM approach.
         6.42.3.1.3. If unable to accept an ILS PRM approach clearance, contact the FAA ATCSCC at
         1-800-333-4286 prior to departure time to obtain a pre-coordinated arrival time. Pilots who
         arrive at a PRM airport unable to accept PRM approach clearance, who did not contact ATC
         prior to departure, should expect an ATC directed divert to a non-PRM airport.
         6.42.3.1.4. All breakouts from the approach shall be hand flown. Autopilots shall be disen-
         gaged when a breakout is directed.
         6.42.3.1.5. Should a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) be received, the pilot shall immedi-
         ately respond to the RA. If following an RA requires deviating from an ATC clearance, the
         pilot shall advise ATC as soon as practical. While following an RA, comply with the turn por-
         tion of the ATC breakout instruction unless the pilot determines safety to be a factor.
70                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


     6.42.4. NDB Procedures. NDB approaches may be flown during day, night, or IMC conditions after
     compliance with any airfield restrictions in GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR. Back up each approach with avail-
     able navaids/GPS to include loading the NDB coordinates in the FMS.
     6.42.5. RNAV Procedures. Properly trained KC-10 aircrews are permitted to fly RNAV and RNAV
     (GPS) approaches. RNAV and RNAV (GPS) approaches will be flown only to LNAV minima.
     6.42.6. Established on a Segment of the Approach. When cleared for, or established, on a segment of
     the approach, and the weather is reported or observed to be below approach minimums, the PF has the
     option of continuing the approach to the missed approach point (MAP)/DH. If the approach is aban-
     doned, level off (or descend if a lower altitude is required for the missed approach procedure). Com-
     ply with the last assigned clearance until a new or amended clearance is received.
        6.42.6.1. Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the runway environment is in
        sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing.
        6.42.6.2. If the approach is continued, sufficient fuel must be available to complete the approach
        and missed approach, and proceed to a suitable alternate with normal fuel reserve.
        6.42.6.3. The PIC has final responsibility for determining when the destination is below desig-
        nated minimums, and for initiating proper clearance request.
     6.42.7. Holding. An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums provided:
        6.42.7.1. The aircraft has more fuel remaining than that required to fly to the alternate and hold
        for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to remain at or above
        alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time.
        6.42.7.2. Divert at or prior to reaching bingo fuel for the divert.

6.43. Classified Equipment and Material. Comply with the following or as directed in MAJCOM sup-
plement.
     6.43.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is onboard, ensure the C2 Center or base operations
     office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security according to Chapter 7 of this AFI. At bases
     not under jurisdiction of the Air Force, ensure the aircraft and equipment are protected. AFI 31-401,
     Information Security Program Management, provides specific guidance concerning the security of
     various levels of classified equipment aboard aircraft. For classified aircraft components which cannot
     be removed and stored, seal the aircraft. If available, use RAVENS to guard the aircraft; otherwise,
     use guards employed by the host country for flightline/airport area control. Do not leave unguarded
     classified information stored in navigation or radio equipment.
     6.43.2. Material. Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination and
     receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified material. The on-site C2 center will provide tempo-
     rary storage for COMSEC and other classified materials during en route, turnaround, and crew rest
     stops. Encrypted COMSEC will only be transferred to authorized DoD personnel.
     6.43.3. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode 4 when required for mission accom-
     plishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode 4 (ground test assets permit-
     ting) before deployment overseas, or as specified in the OPORD or contingency/exercise tasking.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 71


   6.43.4. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode 4 before takeoff. Do not delay takeoff nor cancel a mission
   for an inoperable Mode 4, except when the aircraft will transit an area where safe passage procedures
   are implemented.
   6.43.5. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode 4 on all missions departing the CONUS for overseas
   locations. Aircrews can request the Mode 4 interrogation check through NORAD on UHF frequency
   364.2. See Table 6.3. for Sector Operations Centers (SOCCs) that conduct interrogation checks.

Table 6.3.
CONUS SECTOR LOCATION                    CALL SIGN
Northeast             Griffiss Airport Huntress
Southeast             Tyndall AFB        Oak Grove
Southwest             March ARB          Sierra Pete
Northwest             McChord AFB        Big Foot

   6.43.6. Aircraft with inoperable Mode 4 will continue to their intended destinations. Repairs will be
   accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and maintenance technicians are avail-
   able. In theaters where safe passage is implemented, aircraft will follow procedures for inoperable
   Mode 4 as directed in the applicable airspace control order or Air Tasking Order (ATO).
   6.43.7. Ground and in-flight checks of the Mode 4, when conducted, are mandatory maintenance
   debrief items. Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation of the Mode 4 on all air-
   craft forms (AFTO IMT 781A).
   6.43.8. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate the Mode 4 on
   missions when required for mission accomplishment. Before departing for any destination without
   COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local COMSEC managers for guidance.

6.44. Unscheduled Landings. When an unscheduled landing or crew rest occurs at a base without a pas-
senger facility, the PIC should immediately advise the appropriate C2 agency and request assistance in
arranging substitute airlift for passengers on board. The following procedures apply when obtaining sup-
port for service members, in a group travel status, who are transported on AMC organic aircraft flying a
Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) mission, which incur an unscheduled delay due to weather
or maintenance problems, forcing the members to be lodged at that location until the aircraft can continue
its mission.
   6.44.1. If the delay is at a location where DoD facilities and AMC TWCF funds are available, pay-
   ment for lodging (contract or on-base) will be made by the local accounting liaison/OPLOC citing
   TWCF funds. The appropriate TWCF fund cite may be obtained from the local financial analysis and/
   or accounting liaison office. Normally, a BPA contract or AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization, is
   already established at these locations to charge the routine lodging costs for transient or TDY individ-
   uals who are on TWCF funded travel orders.
   6.44.2. If the delay is at a location where DoD facilities are available and AMC TWCF funds are not
   available, utilize AF IMT 15 authority to acquire the appropriate lodging accommodations. Upon
   return to home station, the PIC will send the AF IMT 15 to the local accounting liaison office. A copy
   of the service members' group travel orders, along with any other pertinent supporting data, must
72                                                  AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


     accompany the form (e.g., lodging invoice and/or receipts). When the AF IMT 15 has been validated,
     it will be forwarded on to the servicing OPLOC for payment, citing the funds of the unit whose air-
     craft was delayed.
     6.44.3. If the delay is at a location where both DoD facilities and TWCF funds are unavailable, the
     PIC will utilize AF IMT 15 authority to acquire the appropriate meals, quarters, and transportation to
     support the service members. Upon return to home station, the PIC will send the AF IMT 15 to the
     local accounting liaison office. A copy of the service members' group travel orders, along with any
     other pertinent supporting data, must accompany the form (e.g., lodging invoice and/or receipts).
     When the AF IMT 15 has been validated, it will be forwarded on to the servicing OPLOC for pay-
     ment, citing the funds of the unit whose aircraft was delayed.
NOTE: This policy does not apply to those passengers on delayed TWCF organic aircraft who are in a
per diem or space available status, except for those duty passengers on TWCF funded travel orders
delayed at locations where TWCF funds are available.

6.45. Maintenance. Complete the AFTO Form 781 after each flight. After landing, crewmembers
debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, avionics equipment, and all
installed special equipment as required. At stations without maintenance support, when a maintenance
requirement exists the PIC will ensure a thorough debrief is provided to the C2 agency. On AMC mis-
sions, notify TACC Logistics Control (TACC/XOCL).

6.46. Border Clearance.
     6.46.1. Normal Operations.
        6.46.1.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border clearance of its
        aircraft.
        6.46.1.2. When support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC. Duties
        may be assigned to ground personnel or the boom operator, but the PIC retains ultimate responsi-
        bility. When a KC-10 aircraft is on-loaded at a base without an air traffic function, the PIC is
        responsible for ensuring the following:
            6.46.1.2.1. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers possess current passports and valid visas,
            when required.
            6.46.1.2.2. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers have current certificates of immunization
            (shot record).
            6.46.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
            6.46.1.2.4. Departing or entering the United States through a location where border clearance
            can be obtained.
            6.46.1.2.5. Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and baggage, if
            required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign area.
            6.46.1.2.6. Spraying the aircraft (see the FCG and Paragraph 6.47.).
     6.46.2. Procedures for US Entry.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                  73


     6.46.2.1. En route, the boom operator will distribute personal customs declarations (when not
     accomplished by passenger services) to all passengers, troops, and crewmembers. The boom oper-
     ator will also brief passengers and crewmembers on customs regulations, and prepare and compile
     necessary border clearance forms for the PIC's signature.
     6.46.2.2. En route, notify the C2 agency at the base of intended landing of any change in ETA to
     ensure that border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
     6.46.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an aircraft, which has
     landed in the United States for customs clearance, to proceed to another base in the US to obtain
     border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of cargo, passengers, and crew
     until arrival at the offload station, and saves intermediate offloading and reloading normally
     required for customs inspection. The permit to proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing
     where the border clearance must be completed or a new permit to proceed issued by a customs
     official. Do not make intermediate stops between the issue point of the permit to proceed and des-
     tination of manifested cargo unless required by an emergency or directed by the controlling C2
     center.
     6.46.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative nor-
     mally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane passengers, troops,
     or crewmembers unless necessary for safety or the preservation of life and property (loadmaster
     excepted). Do not unload until approved by customs and agriculture personnel or their designated
     representatives. This procedure applies to the initial landing in the US and all landings required
     when operating on a permit to proceed or until all crew, passengers, and cargo complete final bor-
     der clearance.
  6.46.3. Inspections of U.S. Aircraft by Foreign Officials.
     6.46.3.1. Follow USAF policy on status of military aircraft as stated in the FCG, General Infor-
     mation (Chapter 3). In substance, this policy holds that US military aircraft are immune from
     searches, seizures, and inspections (including customs and safety inspections) by foreign officials.
     In addition, ACs must be aware of, and adhere to, any specific FCG provisions for individual
     countries.
     6.46.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use the fol-
     lowing procedures.
         6.46.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the PIC to
         the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to search without
         consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials in the country con-
         cerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign author-
         ities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.46.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC should make every
         effort to delay the search until he or she can contact USAF headquarters (through MAJCOM
         C2) or the appropriate embassy officials. The PIC should then notify these agencies of foreign
         request by the most expeditious means available and follow their instructions.
         6.46.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending notification to
         USAF headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the PIC should indicate that he or she would
74                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


            prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying time, and mechanical considerations
            permit a safe flight) and request permission to do so.
            6.46.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way on
            board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he protests the course of action being pursued and
            that he intends to notify both USAF headquarters and the appropriate American embassy of
            the foreign action. The PIC should not attempt physical resistance, and should thereafter report
            the incident to USAF headquarters and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The PIC
            should escort foreign authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
        6.46.3.3. Other procedures may apply when carrying sensitive cargo or equipment. Follow these
        procedures and applicable portions of classified FCG supplements.
     6.46.4. Exercises and Contingency Operations.
        6.46.4.1. General. Certain airlift missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or exit,
        require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health, immunization, and
        agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding, between these agencies and
        MAJCOM establishes certain procedures and waivers.
        6.46.4.2. Implementation. Implementation of the agreement is not automatic. Traffic and border
        clearing agencies implement all or part of the agreement as necessary for each operation. Inspec-
        tion and clearance may be accomplished at the US onload or offload base, or at the foreign onload
        or offload base.
        6.46.4.3. Customs Procedures.
            6.46.4.3.1. Outbound: No requirement. Filing of CBP Form 7507 is not required unless
            directed.
            6.46.4.3.2. Inbound. Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival:
               6.46.4.3.2.1. CBP Form 7507 (Passenger list not required).
               6.46.4.3.2.2. Cargo manifest.
               6.46.4.3.2.3. For troops out of country less than 140 days:

                   sonnel, civilians, news reporters, and crewmembers.
                   6.46.4.3.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs representative will
                   meet the aircraft and accept the troop commander's certificate with respect to troop
                   baggage. Individual baggage declarations are not required. The troop commander
                   should have inspected troop baggage.
                   6.46.4.3.2.3.4. Troops will debark under the observation of the customs representative
                   with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The customs officer may elect to make
                   a more extensive inspection.
               6.46.4.3.2.4. For troops who are out of the country 140 days or more:
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                               75

               gage, U.S., or CBP Form 6059B.
               6.46.4.3.2.4.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs representative will
               meet the aircraft and collect all declarations. Troops will debark under the observation
               of the customs representative who may make discretionary examination of the bag-
               gage.
     6.46.4.4. Public Health Procedures.
        6.46.4.4.1. When operating from a base without a traffic officer, the AC will ensure all crew-
        members and passengers are properly immunized.
        6.46.4.4.2. Spray the aircraft if required.
     6.46.4.5. Immigration Procedures.

        6.46.4.6.1. Outbound: No requirement.
        6.46.4.6.2. Inbound: Consult AMC Border Clearance Guide.
            6.46.4.6.2.1. The command being airlifted will instruct troops that no fresh fruit, milk,
            milk products, vegetables, plants, plant pests, soil samples, animals, meat, and animal
            products can be brought into the United States. All items of troop personal gear/cargo are
            to be thoroughly cleaned of mud, dirt, sand, and other foreign material before being
            brought aboard the aircraft. Personal gear and equipment must be examined for snails and
            other plant pests to prevent their accidental entry into the U.S.
            6.46.4.6.2.2. Before loading, the command responsible for cargo being airlifted will clear
            vehicles and cargo of snails or other plant pests and of all mud and soil.
            6.46.4.6.2.3. When required by agricultural quarantine regulations, the FCG, or higher
            headquarters, the aircraft will receive an aerosol treatment 30 minutes before landing.
            6.46.4.6.2.4. On arrival, agricultural inspectors will inspect the aircraft after troops have

            removal by fleet service personnel.
            6.46.4.6.2.5. Inspectors examine baggage, equipment, vehicles, and cargo as offloaded.
            Any items, vehicles, or cargo found to be contaminated will be held for such treatment as
            the inspector may direct (washing, steam cleaning, physical cleaning, or fumigation).
  6.46.5. Military Customs Pre-clearance Inspection Program. All crewmembers will ensure compli-
  ance with Military Customs Pre-clearance requirements.

6.47. Insect and Pest Control.
     6.47.1. Responsibility. PICs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to AFJI 48-104,
     Medical and Agricultural Foreign and Domestic Quarantine Regulations for Vessels, Aircraft, and
     Other Transports of the Armed Forces (Joint), Department of Defense FCG, or as directed by higher
     headquarters. Certify the spraying on CBP Form 7507, or on forms provided by the country transited.
     Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on board. The only exception is when mandated by
     the FCG.
        6.47.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent, National
        Stock Number (NSN) 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft. Wear leather or
        Nomex gloves while spraying.
            6.47.1.1.1. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being sprayed.
            6.47.1.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely loading fuel,
            baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments, wheel wells, and other sim-
            ilar spaces.
            6.47.1.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the aircraft after
            the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and ventilation openings.
CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after use, spray before boarding crew or pas-
sengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10 minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before
allowing anyone on board.
        6.47.1.2. Spray for 105 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being tran-
        sited.
NOTE: Keep used aerosol cans separate from other trash so they may be disposed of safely.
     6.47.2. Responsibility of PIC In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the aircraft
     in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, airfield management operations, or airport manager of the
     situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
     6.47.3. Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not open
     cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for insect or rodent
     infestation. Do not onload or offload cargo or passengers until the inspection is satisfactorily com-
     pleted. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local requirements, as arranged by the base
     air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.

Section 6G—Miscellaneous

6.48. Dropped Objects. If an externally dropped object is discovered, the flight crew will:
     6.48.1. Notify TACC or the controlling agency as soon as practical; include details of routing, alti-
     tude, weather, etc.
     6.48.2. Notify maintenance at the first military station transited.

6.49. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). If involved in a mishap or incident, after landing and terminating
the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 77


6.50. Life Support and Dash 21 Equipment Documentation. The PIC or designated representative
will:
   6.50.1. Before departing home station or en route stations, ensure appropriate serviceable protective
   clothing, life support, survival, and dash 21 equipment for the entire or remainder of the mission are
   aboard the aircraft.
   6.50.2. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review AF Form 4076,
   Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, to ensure all required Dash 21 equipment has been certified
   as installed by maintenance, the initial check has been signed by maintenance, and configuration doc-
   uments match mission requirements.
   6.50.3. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review, sign, and date
   the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, to ensure all required protective cloth-
   ing and life support and survival equipment have been certified as installed by aircrew life support and
   that configuration documents match mission requirements. Ensure appropriate number and type of life
   preservers are aboard for over-water missions carrying children and infants.
   6.50.4. Missing Equipment. Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will accomplish the
   following:
       6.50.4.1. Make an AFTO Form 781A entry for equipment found missing. Additionally, ensure
       equipment removed from the aircraft at an en route station is documented in the AFTO Form
       781A.
       6.50.4.2. Annotate AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form 46 in the next vacant column indicating the
       quantity remaining for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check
       number of that column. Leave AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form 46 on board the aircraft in the
       event of an en route crew change.
       6.50.4.3. Advise the PIC and determine whether the missing equipment should be recovered or
       replaced before mission continuation.
       6.50.4.4. Assist, as required, in preparing reports of survey for missing equipment.
       6.50.4.5. When possible, advise HQ AMC/A37TL (or MAJCOM life support office) and appro-
       priate C2 agency (or airport management) before mission continuation.
   6.50.5. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the preflight than is annotated
   on the AF Form 4076 or AFTO Form 46, annotate the total quantity in the next vacant column for the
   item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check number of that column.

6.51. Passenger Restrictions.
   6.51.1. No-show passenger baggage or baggage of passengers removed from flight will be down-
   loaded prior to departure. See exception at Paragraph 13.4.2.5.
   6.51.2. The cargo compartment will not be used to airlift personnel, except by specific approval of
   HQ AMC/A3.
   6.51.3. Personnel Limitations. Table 6.4., Personnel/Lavatory Requirements, reflects the flying
   hours that a number of personnel (crew and passengers) may be accommodated with only one or with
78                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


     both lavatories available. These figures must be considered when determining the number of person-
     nel that may be airlifted.

NOTES:
     1. The lavatories should be properly serviced and operational at the station requiring airlift of
        these maximum figures.
        2. Crew members must be included in total personnel given to arrive at the maximum load.
        3. Small children (up to 7 years old) should not be considered when computing load figures.

6.52. Airfield Data Reports. Aircrews transiting unfamiliar airfields or airfields where conditions may
adversely affect subsequent flight will:
     6.52.1. Report airfield characteristics that produce illusions, such as runway length, width, slope, and
     lighting, as compared to standard runways, sloping approach terrain, runway contrast against sur-
     rounding terrain, haze, glare, etc., and previously unknown obstacles, airfield markings, or other
     safety critical items to HQ AMC/A36AS.
     6.52.2. Debrief the next C2 center transited.

6.53. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the PIC should
impound the aircraft immediately after landing and contact the controlling C2 agency for further instruc-
tions.

6.54. Not Used.

6.55. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria. Acceptance of
traffic information, instructions to follow an aircraft, or a visual approach clearance is acknowledgment
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 79


that the PIC will ensure takeoff and landing intervals and accepts responsibility of providing wake turbu-
lence separation. Refer to FLIP General Planning (GP) section 5-37 for more information concerning
wake turbulence separation.

6.56. Overflying En Route Stops. The C2 agency may approve a request to overfly a scheduled en route
stop (AFRC command center for AFRC-directed missions).

6.57. Use of Forward Entry Ladder. Use of the forward entry ladder as an alternate means of aircraft
ingress/egress is restricted to operational necessity. Baggage will not be loaded/off-loaded using the lad-
der. The ladder’s use is normally restricted to flight crew members and maintenance personnel only. Use
of the forward entry ladder to load/unload passengers will be at the discretion of the PIC.

                                         AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting aircraft
piracy (hijacking) of the KC-10 aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijack-
ing), AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and specific MAJCOM security publica-
tions contain additional guidance. Aircrews will not release information concerning hijacking attempts or
identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public.

7.2. Security. The KC-10 is a “Protection Level 3” resource. Aircraft security at non-United States mili-
tary installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency.

7.3. Air Force Installation Security Program. The following security procedures will implement AFI
31-101; requirements for KC-10 aircraft:
     7.3.1. The aircraft will be parked in an established restricted area and afforded protection via a roving
     patrol, a two-person Internal Security Response Team (ISRT),with immediate response not to exceed
     3 minutes, and a two-person External Security Response Team, (ESRT) with response capability
     within 5 minutes..
     7.3.2. When no permanent or established restricted area parking space is available, establish a tempo-
     rary restricted area consisting of a raised rope barrier, and post with restricted area signs. Provide a
     one-person mobile patrol, supported by a two-person ISRT capable of a 5-minute response. Portable
     security lighting will be provided during the hours of darkness if sufficient permanent lighting is not
     available.
     7.3.3. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local security
     capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If he or she determines secu-
     rity to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate security is available.
     7.3.4. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security force POC must
     be identified to the PIC.
     7.3.5. Security support is a continual requirement and is not negated by the presence of aircrew or
     ground crew members. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft doors are closed and
     the aircraft taxis.

7.4. Standby Aircraft Security. Ensure aircraft hatches and doors are secured to show unauthorized
entry. The PIC shall notify the C2 agency the aircraft is sealed and provide them a means to access the air-
craft in an emergency. Annotate the forms with the time the aircraft was sealed. The C2 Senior Controller
may grant access to a sealed aircraft, shall document time of entry, and ensure it remains launch capable.
The PIC or designated representative must be present if access to the aircraft is required and will ensure
the aircraft is resealed. The aircrew pre-flight portion will remain valid if performed by one aircrew,
sealed, and flown by another aircrew.
NOTE: WG/CCs should develop local procedures for documentation and management IAW TO 00-20-1
and MAJCOM Supplement.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                    81


7.5. En Route Security. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to ensure ade-
quate en route security is available. The PIC will receive a threat assessment and en route security capa-
bility evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation prior to home station departure and should
request updates from en route C2 as required. If required, a PHOENIX RAVEN team will be assigned to
the mission.
   7.5.1. The PHOENIX RAVEN team will consist of three US Air Force security force members, but
   may include more depending on security requirements. The team's travel status is determined by
   MAJCOM. The team travels in MEGP status and is responsible to the PIC at all times. In turn, the PIC
   is responsible for its welfare (transportation, lodging, etc.). Ensure security team members receive a
   mission briefing, aircraft egress/passenger briefing (as appropriate).
   7.5.2. Arrival. On arrival, the PIC will assess the local situation and take the following actions as
   required:
       7.5.2.1. Area patrol. Request area security patrols from local security forces. If local authorities
       request payment for this service, use AF IMT 15.
       7.5.2.2. Aircrew surveillance. During short ground times, direct armed crew members to remain
       with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in the aircraft vicin-
       ity.
       7.5.2.3. Inadequate Security. If, in the opinion of the PIC, airfield security is inadequate and the
       PIC determines the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the FDP limits and crew
       rest requirements and depart as soon as possible for a base considered reliable. Report movement
       and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as practical. If a departure is not possible, the air-
       crew must secure the aircraft to the best of their ability. In no case, will the entire crew leave the
       aircraft unattended. Crew rest requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the air-
       frame may be at risk. The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both
       aircraft protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request security assistance from the near-
       est DoD installation, US Embassy, local military or law enforcement agencies as appropriate.
   7.5.3. Entry Control Procedures. Unescorted entry is granted to aircrew members and support person-
   nel assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199, Air Force Entry Control
   Card, supported by an Entry Access List (EAL) or aircrew orders. Aircrew members and assigned
   crew chiefs are authorized escort authority.
       7.5.3.1. Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their duties
       under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
       7.5.3.2. Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area.

7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
   7.6.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed to allow
   ground personnel immediate access. If, in the PIC’s judgment, the aircraft needs to be locked and
   sealed in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
       7.6.1.1. Use available aircraft ground security locking devices.
       7.6.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape inside of
       doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
82                                                     AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


        7.6.1.3. Close and lock the door (1L).
        7.6.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of a forced
        entry.
        7.6.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the Office of Special Investigation (OSI),
        security forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency. Have aircraft thoroughly inspected prior to
        flight.
     7.6.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must always
     remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations. During preflight
     activities, aircrews will inspect accessible areas, to include: aircraft wheel wells, center accessory
     compartment, forward avionics compartment, and ARO aft accessory compartment for unauthorized
     packages, personnel, or other unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious items to host security forces.
     Aircrews will maintain a heightened security posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.

7.7. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
     7.7.1. The Air Transportation Act of 1974 and the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, vest the
     FAA Administrator with exclusive responsibility for the direction of law enforcement activity in air-
     craft hijacking situations involving all aircraft (civil and military) in-flight in the United States.
     7.7.2. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under military
     command within the scope of their duties.
     7.7.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying documents, equip-
     ment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or weapons of mass destruction,
     DoD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with all per-
     tinent information. Where possible, the FAA will consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing
     any law enforcement activity.
     7.7.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft is opera-
     tionally ready for flight.
     7.7.5. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military contract air-
     craft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
     7.7.6. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be resisted in
     a manner appropriate to the situation.
     7.7.7. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom the threat
     of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may be ineffective.
     Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the hijackers may require use
     of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
     7.7.8. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of life or
     property.
     7.7.9. In the case of an aircraft carrying passengers, the primary concern is the safety of the passen-
     gers. However, at times control of the aircraft will be paramount even to the detriment of the safety of
     the passengers and aircrew.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                   83


   7.7.10. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested by the
   pilot in command of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the anti-hijacking
   effort.

7.8. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are taken to min-
imize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When a KC-10 is operating away from home station,
the PIC will comply with this chapter and AFI 13-207, as supplemented.
   7.8.1. Preventive measures include the following: The host station passenger processing or manifest-
   ing facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers until the PIC is fully
   satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of qualified passenger service representatives, the PIC
   will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and baggage is accomplished.
   7.8.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients. When
   patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform required inspections
   prior to loading.
   7.8.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the movement of
   large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers and perform
   anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.8.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried baggage
   aboard an aircraft. EXECPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or State Department,
   RAVEN Team Members, and other individuals specifically authorized to carry weapons.
       7.8.4.1. Troops or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an aircraft.
       They will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may carry unloaded weapons and
       ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations. When the tactical situation dictates (in
       coordination with the aircrew), weapons may be loaded at the order of the troop commander or
       team leader.
       7.8.4.2. Dummy clips that can be easily identified may be loaded for training at the order of the
       team leader in coordination with the aircrew.
       7.8.4.3. RAVENs will only be armed in-flight on specifically designated missions identified on
       the mission “frag” as “RAVEN in-flight arming required.”
   7.8.5. If weapons must be cleared, instruct the individual(s) to:
       7.8.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or personnel
       before un-holstering or un-slinging their weapons.
       7.8.5.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures. Ensure troop/aircraft com-
       mander retains ammunition IAW paragraph 7.8.4.1.

7.9. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft within the
United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time as FAA assumes
active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military aircraft. Resistance may
vary from simple dissuasion, through deception and subterfuge, to direct physical confrontation, includ-
ing the prudent use of weapons.
84                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


     7.9.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened, while the
     aircraft is on the ground:
        7.9.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the aircrew to
        establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
        7.9.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is vested in
        the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot be established, or
        when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following order:
            7.9.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
            7.9.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose AOR the airfield lies.
            7.9.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
            7.9.1.2.4. PIC in compliance with MAJCOM directives.
     7.9.2. A hijacked aircraft carrying weapons of mass destruction will not be allowed to takeoff. Refer
     to DoD 5210.41M, Nuclear Weapon Security Manual paragraph 9B(3), for additional guidance.

7.10. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the resourceful-
ness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific counter-hijacking proce-
dure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of action to be taken, including the
nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the
hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may
consider are:
     7.10.1. Engage the hijacker(s) in conversation in an attempt to calm them and to evaluate what course
     of action might be effective.
     7.10.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
     7.10.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
     7.10.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a hostile, coun-
     try.
     7.10.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker physically,
     including the prudent use of firearms.

7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking threat will
notify ground agencies by any means available as soon as practical and follow-up with situation reports as
circumstances permit.
     7.11.1. If possible, transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. Controllers will assign
     IFF code 7500 (does not preclude subsequent selection of code 7700).
     7.11.2. If in-the-clear transmissions are not possible, report "am being hijacked" by setting transpon-
     der to code 7500. If unable to change transponder code, or when not under radar control, transmit a
     radio message to include the phrase "(call sign) transponder seven five zero zero."
     7.11.3. Controllers will acknowledge receipt and understanding of transponder code 7500 by trans-
     mitting "(call sign) (facility name) verify squawking 7500." An affirmative reply or lack of reply from
     the pilot indicates confirmation and proper authorities are notified.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                  85


   7.11.4. To report "situation appears desperate; want armed intervention," after code 7500 is used,
   change to code 7700. If unable to change transponder code to 7700, or when not under radar control,
   transmit "(aircraft call sign) transponder seven seven zero zero."
       7.11.4.1. When changing from code 7500 to code 7700, remain on 7500 for at least 3 minutes or
       until a confirmation of code 7500 is received from ATC, whichever is sooner, before changing to
       code 7700. ATC acknowledges code 7700 by transmitting "(call sign) (facility name) now reading
       you on transponder seven seven zero zero."
       7.11.4.2. Aircraft squawking 7700, after squawking 7500, which are not in radio contact with
       ATC, are considered by ATC to have an in-flight emergency (in addition to hijacking), and the
       appropriate emergency procedures are followed. Notification of authorities in this case includes
       information that the aircraft displayed the hijack code as well as the emergency code.
   7.11.5. To report "situation still desperate, want armed intervention and aircraft immobilized," leave
   flaps full down after landing, or select landing flaps while on the ground. To facilitate message distri-
   bution, transmit "(aircraft call sign) flaps are full down."
   7.11.6. To report "leave alone, do not intervene," retract the flaps after landing. Pilots who retract
   flaps after squawking 7700 should return to code 7500 and remain on code 7500 for the next leg of the
   hijacked flight unless the situation changes. Transmit "(call sign) back on seven five zero zero" to
   emphasize the fact intervention is no longer desired.

7.12. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. Refer to FIH for international signals for air inter-
cept.

7.13. Arming of Crew Members. When crews are directed to carry weapons, at least one flight engineer
and one boom operator will be armed. All crew members should know who is armed. The following pro-
cedures apply when arming is directed:
   7.13.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, obtain weapons, ammunition, box, lock and
   key. Crew members will be armed according to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
   Personnel and MAJCOM publications. If an armed crew member must leave the crew en route, trans-
   fer the weapon to another authorized crew member using AF IMT 1297.
   7.13.2. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to prevent identifying
   armed crew members. Do not wear weapons off the flight line except to and from the C2, armories,
   and other facilities associated with aircrew activities.
       7.13.2.1. AMC Passenger Terminal Procedures. Armed crewmembers must discreetly identify
       themselves to AMC passenger service personnel upon arrival at security checkpoints. One crew-
       member will present a valid set of crew orders, military identification card, and AF Form 523,
       USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, authorizing the carrying of concealed weapons. Once
       terminal personnel verify this, they will allow the crewmember to vouch for the remaining crew-
       members. The entire crew will then proceed through the magnetometer without removing objects
       from their pockets. This will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are
       armed.
   7.13.3. Weapons Storage In-Flight. Crew members will be armed before beginning preflight, on-load
   or off-load duties and until completion of all post-flight duties. When no passengers are aboard, weap-
86                                                  AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


     ons may be stored in the gun box in-flight after a satisfactory stowaway check. Crew members will
     rearm before landing. Weapons need not be unloaded before placing them in a gun box.
     7.13.4. Weapons Storage on the Ground.
        7.13.4.1. Aircrews, including stage crews, will store weapons and ammunition in the most secure
        facility available, normally the base armory.
        7.13.4.2. Non-stage aircrews may store weapons and ammunition in the aircraft gun box.
     7.13.5. When storing weapons in the gun box:
        7.13.5.1. Weapons should normally not be unloaded.
        7.13.5.2. Inform C2 which crew member has the gun box key.
     7.13.6. Crew members will ensure they are reissued the same weapon until mission termination at
     home station.
     7.13.7. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing barrels if
     available. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another crew member; place the
     weapon on a flat surface.

7.14. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times. Reference
AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual, Joint Service Guide 5260, Service Member's Personal Protection
Guide: Combat Terrorism While Overseas, and AFI 31-210, The Air Force Antiterrorism/Force Protec-
tion (AT/FP) Program Standards, for force protection measures.

                                                 Chapter 8

                              OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS

8.1. General. This chapter provides guidelines for worksheets, reports, and forms associated with AMC
operational activities. Consult governing instruction or contact wing, unit, or local flight safety officers
for assistance with safety forms.

8.2. AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report. The AF IMT 457 is a tool to notify supervisors and com-
manders of a hazardous condition that requires prompt corrective action. For hazardous weather, com-
plete the front side of an AF IMT 457 and send it to the parent wing flying safety office. If addressing a
computer flight plan deficiency, attach a copy of the AF IMT 72, Air Report (AIREP). Send your report
so the parent unit receives it within 5 days of the event. For more information, see AFI 91-202, The US Air
Force Mishap Prevention Program.

8.3. AF IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR). The AF IMT 651 is a tool to report near
midair collisions and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions. See Attachment 3 of AFI 91-202 for more
information concerning the HATR program.
   8.3.1. AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investi-
   gations and Reports, list HATR reportable incidents.
   8.3.2. The PIC shall report the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency (e.g. center, Flight
   Service Station (FSS), control tower, or aeronautical radio station) as quickly as safety allows. Include
   the following information in the radio call (as appropriate):
       8.3.2.1. Aircraft identification or call sign.
       8.3.2.2. Time and place (radial/DME of NAVAID, position relative to the airfield, incident, etc).
       8.3.2.3. Altitude or flight level.
       8.3.2.4. Description of the other aircraft or vehicle.
       8.3.2.5. Advise controlling ATC agency that the PIC will file a HATR upon landing.
   8.3.3. Deadline to file a HATR is 24 hours after event via any communication mode available. If
   landing airport has a USAF airfield management function, submit completed AF IMT 651 to the air-
   field management officer for forwarding to wing safety office. If landing airport does not have an air-
   field management office, notify the safety office of the Air Force base nearest to location where the
   condition occurred, PIC’s home base safety office, or as prescribed by overseas MAJCOM. In that
   case, provide contact sufficient information to prepare AF IMT 651.
   8.3.4. Grant individuals who submit a HATR immunity from disciplinary action provided:
       8.3.4.1. If they were the offending party, their violation was not deliberate.
       8.3.4.2. They committed no criminal offense.
       8.3.4.3. Their actions did not result in a mishap.
       8.3.4.4. They properly reported the incident using procedures above.
88                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


8.4. AMC IMT 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence Worksheet. T h e A M C
IMT 97 is a tool to notify appropriate authorities of any mishap involving crewmembers or aircraft. PICs
shall complete all appropriate areas of the form in as much detail as possible. When notified, AMC C2
agents will inform their supervisor/commander to start investigation and reporting activities IAW AFI
91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and Operation Report 3 (OPREP-3) procedures.
     8.4.1. PICs will report crewmember or passenger injury, aircraft damage, or injury/damage to another
     organization’s people or equipment caused by PIC’s aircraft/crewmember. At a minimum, report the
     following:
        8.4.1.1. Any physiological episode (physiological reaction, near accident, or hazard in-flight due
        to medical or physiological reasons).
        8.4.1.2. A human factors related situation, e.g. misinterpretation of instruments; information
        overload (i.e. tactile, aural, and visual input too fast to permit reasonable analysis/decision); air-
        crew task saturation (i.e. too many responses/actions required in a short period of time); or con-
        fused switchology (i.e. adjacent switches where actuation of wrong switch creates dangerous
        situation). Anonymous reports are acceptable.
        8.4.1.3. A condition that required engine shutdown, in-flight flameout, engine failure, suspected
        engine power loss, or loss of thrust that required descent below MEA. Engine failures include, but
        are not limited to, shrapnel from a failed internal engine component penetrating the engine case,
        engine case rupture/burn-through, engine nacelle fire, substantial fuel leak, or unselected thrust
        reversal. Consistent with safety, immediately report incidents that involve multiple engines (may
        report single-engine incidents upon landing). NOTE: Exclude intentional shutdowns for FCF
        unless the engine fails to restart.
        8.4.1.4. A flight control malfunction (including the autopilot and trim systems) that results in an
        unexpected or hazardous change of flight attitude, altitude, or heading. Enter the flag words,
        “Reportable Flight Control Malfunction” in the AFTO 781A.
        8.4.1.5. A landing gear malfunction aggravated by failed emergency system or procedures.
        8.4.1.6. A cargo door, ramp or other door malfunction when intent for flight exists which could
        affect system integrity.
        8.4.1.7. An in-flight loss of all pitot-static or gyro-stabilized attitude/directional instrument indi-

     appropriate MAJCOM agencies. Reportable events include, but are not limited to, spectrum interfer-
     ence, interception, fuel dumping, multiple engine failure, hostile fire, injury to passenger or aircrew
     member, etc. This list is not all exhaustive. Most events require C2 agents to forward OPREP reports
     to higher headquarters. In all cases, pass the “who, what, when, where, why, and how” of the incident
     to a C2 agency.
        8.5.6.1. The Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, covered in AFI 10-707, Spectrum Inter-
        ference Resolution Program, establishes procedures to combat the effect of meaconing, intrusion,
        jamming, and interference. PICs who encounter electromagnetic interference (EMI) will report
        the event to the nearest C2 agency as soon as practical.
            8.5.6.1.1. Address EMI reports to: HQ AMC SCOTT AFB IL//A63// and addressees listed in
            AFI 10-707. Send reports via electronic message format with the following information in
            plain text:

                8.5.6.1.1.2. Equipment affected by EMI. Location of the system. The system function,
                name, nomenclature, manufacturer with model number or other system description. The
                operating mode of the system, if applicable (frequency agile, pulse doppler, search, etc.).
                8.5.6.1.1.3. Description of EMI (noise, pulsed, continuous, intermittent, on so forth).
                8.5.6.1.1.4. Effect EMI had on system performance (reduced range, false targets, reduced
                intelligibility, data errors, etc.).
                8.5.6.1.1.5. Date(s) and time(s) of EMI.
                8.5.6.1.1.6. Location where EMI occurred (coordinates or line of bearing, if known, other-
                wise state as unknown.)
                8.5.6.1.1.7. Source of the EMI if known.
                8.5.6.1.1.8. List other units that received interference (if known) and their location or dis-
                tance and bearing from your location.
                8.5.6.1.1.9. A clear, concise narrative summary on what you know about the EMI, with
                any actions taken to resolve the problem.
                8.5.6.1.1.10. Whether or not PIC wants expert/technical assistance (include level of secu-
                rity clearance expert requires).
                8.5.6.1.1.11. Specify impact the EMI had on your mission.
                8.5.6.1.1.12. Provide a POC (Name, Rank, DSN/Commercial Phone Number, and Duty
                hours).
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                  91


           8.5.6.1.2. C2 agents must prepare an OPREP-3 if EMI is suspected meaconing, intrusion, or
           jamming, interference sufficient to cause a hazard, or if, in the PIC’s judgment, the situation
           warrants such a report.
           8.5.6.1.3. PICs shall serve as classification authority for EMI reports. Evaluate an adversar-
           ies’ ability to exploit certain systems using EMI and protect information accordingly. PICs on
           a non-sensitive mission or who judge the EMI to be interference from a non-hostile source
           need not classify EMI reports unless that report would reveal system vulnerability. Classify
           interference report(s) at stations located in combat areas or during sensitive military missions.

8.6. Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) - Aviation Fuels Documentation. This section prescribes
aviation POL (AVPOL) procedures that ensure correct documentation, form and invoice processing, and
program supervision. Reference AFI 23-202, Buying Petroleum Products and Other Supplies and Ser-
vices Off-Station. Use the Multi Service Corporation (MSC) air card for the purchase of aviation fuel and
ancillary ground services at commercial airports (and some military installations) worldwide. The air card
is authorized for use by all U.S. government aircraft, state, and local law enforcement aircraft, and some
foreign government aircraft. All PICs should plan to use the “platinum” MSC card. In most cases, there
will be no changes when refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract locations. The
MSC card is accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide. A list of all MSC-accepting mer-
chants can be found at https://www.airseacard.com. It replaces the Standard Form (SF) 44, Purchase
Order-Invoice-Voucher, at locations that accept the MSC card.
   8.6.1. Responsibilities. Aircrew and maintenance personnel will be familiar with AVPOL procedures
   and documentation requirements of this chapter. Improper use of the MSC card could create financial
   liability for the purchaser.
   8.6.2. Refuel/defuel USAF aircraft at DoD locations whenever possible. If DoD service is not avail-
   able, purchase fuel from other source(s) in the following priority:
       8.6.2.1. Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) or Canadian into-plane contracts.
       8.6.2.2. Foreign government air forces.
NOTE: DoD FLIP en route supplements identify locations with into-plane contracts.
   8.6.3. AVPOL Forms Documentation and Procedures.
       8.6.3.1. The DD1898, Fuel Sale Slip, is the fuel transaction receipt used for purchases at other
       DoD locations, including DFSC into-plane contract locations. Log and place the DD1898 inside
       the AF IMT 664, Aircraft Fuels Documenting Log. The PIC or designated representative shall
       complete this form. NOTE: If the contractor insists on a unique invoice along with the DD1898,
       annotate the vendor’s invoice with “DUPLICATE DD1898 ACCOMPLISHED.”
       8.6.3.2. The AF IMT 664 is a tool to log and store all AVPOL transaction forms. Record all
       off-station transactions on the front of the form and insert the original form inside the envelope.
       Turn in the AF IMT 664, with supporting forms, to maintenance debriefing or as directed by local
       procedures. The PIC or designated representative shall complete this form when appropriate.
       8.6.3.3. The SF 44 may be used to purchase fuel, ground services and/or other authorized prod-
       ucts when no MSC card contract is in place.
           8.6.3.3.1. SF 44 fuel purchases where FBO agrees to invoice DESC for payment.
92                                           AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


        8.6.3.3.1.1. The aircrew shall present the SF 44 as the purchase invoice when an FBO
        refuses to accept the MSC card. The aircrew shall complete the SF 44 and attach it to the
        FBO vendor ticket/invoice when the FBO also declines use of the SF 44 and uses its own
        invoice/receipt. Fuel purchases shall be documented on a separate SF 44 from ground ser-
        vices and other authorized products since the FBO must invoice DESC for the fuel and the
        customer for non-fuel product and services.
        8.6.3.3.1.2. Copies 1 and 2 of the SF 44 shall be provided to the FBO. Copy 1 of the SF 44
        and one copy of the FBO commercial invoice, if applicable, shall be forwarded to the fol-
        lowing address by the FBO to bill/invoice DESC: DESC-RRF, Building 1621-K, 2261
        Hughes Avenue, Suite 128, Lackland AFB, Texas 78236.
        8.6.3.3.1.3. Copy 3 of the SF 44 and one copy of the FBO commercial invoice, if applica-
        ble, shall be provided to the aircrew. Log and place a copy inside the AF IMT 664. Air-
        crews shall present all fuel purchase receipts to the designated aviation squadron
        Certifying Official and/or Accountable Official upon return to home station to enable
        timely validation and financial obligation processing into the Fuels Automated System
        (FAS).
     8.6.3.3.2. SF 44 fuel purchases where the FBO requires cash payment.
        8.6.3.3.2.1. Cash fuel purchases are only authorized when either the DOD 4500.54G,
        DoD Foreign Clearance Guide, requires cash payment, or when FBO locations outside the
        United States and U. S. Territories refuse MSC card and/or SF 44 invoicing processes. Air-
        crews required to pay cash for aviation fuel purchases shall employ the following proce-
        dures (NOTE: these procedures do not apply to non-fuel products or services):
            8.6.3.3.2.1.1. The aircrew shall obtain cash from a local DoD Finance source that is
            charged to an approved Treasury suspense account prior to home station departure.
            8.6.3.3.2.1.2. Aircrews shall complete the SF 44 and obtain the FBO fuel vendor
            annotation in block 11 of the SF 44 to confirm total cash amount and also sign and date
            the SF 44 blocks 20 and 21. Log and place a copy inside the AF IMT 664. Aircrew
            shall return unused cash to their local DoD Finance source upon return to home station.
            Present the completed SF 44 (for non-fuel charges only) to the appropriate home sta-
            tion administrative personnel for processing (e.g., Wing Refueling Document Control
            Officer, Finance Office, etc.)
     8.6.3.3.3. SF 44 purchases of ground services and other approved products (not fuel).
        8.6.3.3.3.1. Complete a separate SF 44 for non-fuel purchases. Provide the FBO copies 1
        and 2 of the SF 44. The FBO shall use copy 1 and one copy of the FBO commercial
        invoice, if applicable, to directly bill/invoice the purchasing organization. Block 9 of the
        SF 44 shall reflect the organization name and address of the finance office responsible for
        payment to the FBO. The purchasing organization shall make payment to the FBO upon
        receipt of the invoice from the FBO. Log and place a copy inside the AF IMT 664.
     8.6.3.3.4. If the vendor presents their own form for signature and accepts the SF 44, write the
     statement "SF 44 Executed" on the vendor’s form.
     8.6.3.3.5. Turn in two copies of the SF 44 to the operations officer at home station.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                93


        8.6.3.3.6. Present the aircraft identaplate for purchases at SITCO Agreement locations. Make
        certain the invoice includes date of transaction, grade of product, quantity issued/defueled,
        unit of measure, and signature of Air Force member who accepted product. If vendor also
        requires completed SF 44, write statement, "AF FORMS EXECUTED” on vendor’s invoice.
        Log and place a copy inside the AF IMT 664.
     8.6.3.4. Purchasing Aviation Fuel in Canada. The DoD and Canadian Department of National
     Defence have signed a memorandum of understanding allowing DoD aircraft to use the DD1896,
     when refueling at Canadian airfields with a Canadian National Defense Contract (CNDC). Use the
     AIR for fuel purchases at Canadian airports without a CNDC, and for ground handling services at
     all Canadian airports.
     8.6.3.5. Use host country forms to effect purchases at foreign military airfields, including
     “replacement-in-kind” locations. Hand scribe information from aircraft identaplate on the local
     form. Log and place a copy inside the AF IMT 664.
     8.6.3.6. DD791, DoD In-Flight Issue Log, is a tool to log in-flight off-load of fuel. Except for
     gallons transferred, fill out all blocks on the form. Use eight digit tail numbers for the tanker and
     receivers. Log and place a copy inside the AF IMT 664 and turn it in IAW local procedures.
     8.6.3.7. AF Form 1994, Fuels Issue/Defuel Document, records fuel purchases at USAF bases
     using a valid DD1896. The PIC or designated representative shall complete the form then log and
     place a copy inside the AF IMT 664.
     8.6.3.8. AFTO Form 781H (IMT-V1), Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance Doc-
     ument, records POL actions for particular airframe IAW applicable directives. The PIC or desig-
     nated representative shall complete the form and submit to maintenance debrief.
     8.6.3.9. DD1896, DoD Fuel Identaplate, is the aircraft fuel and oil charge card.
     8.6.3.10. The PIC will verify the AFTO Form 781H is completed and turned in to maintenance
     debriefing following the mission.
     8.6.3.11. For off-station missions, the PIC will complete or verify accuracy of the SF 44, AF IMT
     664, AFTO Form 781H, DD1898, and associated fuels receipts then place them in the AF IMT
     664 (use eight digits for all USAF aircraft tail number entries). The PIC will transmit all AF IMT
     664 information via phone, fax, or message if mission causes him/her to be off-station past the last
     day of the month
     8.6.3.12. Boom operators will:
        8.6.3.12.1. Collect all pertinent information to document in-flight refuel operation to include,
        receiver aircraft MDS, unit of assignment, and home station. Obtain information from flying
        schedule prior to flight, verbally/visually during flight, or by any means following flight.
        NOTE: Boom operators may submit an incomplete DD791 only after exhausting all means to
        obtain the required data. In those cases, boom operators must include a brief explanation as to
        why the data is missing. Unit commanders will develop a local procedure to collect required
        information prior to the form’s final processing.
        8.6.3.12.2. Prior to fuel off-load, get receiver aircraft’s eight-digit tail number for USAF
        receivers, and six-digit bureau number for USN and USMC receivers (use interphone radio,
        boom interphone, or visually if open communication would compromise mission during clan-
94                                                  AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


           destine or covert operations or threaten safety of flight. When refueling the same receiver mul-
           tiple times on a single mission, enter a separate line on the DD791 for each A/R. NOTE:
           EMCON 2 or 3 training does not disqualify inter-plane radio to obtain or verify AR data. Do
           not use inter-plane radios during actual EMCON 2, 3, or 4 to obtain or verify AR data unless
           specifically authorized by the mission directive. Consider HAVE QUICK II and secure voice
           if visual conditions make the tail number too difficult to read.
           8.6.3.12.3. Not use “known/suspected” aircraft serial number that belongs to unit being
           fueled, but not necessarily the actual aircraft getting fuel. Auditors compare receiver unit air-
           craft serial numbers with fuel load reports at home station. If “known/suspected” aircraft tail
           number billed is incorrect (in maintenance/unable to fly), the auditor will reject the fuel bill
           and the tanker unit is liable for the cost of the fuel transferred.
           8.6.3.12.4. Comply with locally established procedures to complete DD791 for classified
           in-flight refuelings.
       8.6.3.13. Flight Engineers will accurately record fueling actions on the AFTO Form 781H, AF
       IMT 4091, Flight Engineers Worksheet, and AF IMT 664. When available, record receiver refu-
       eling information (i.e., tail number, unit of assignment, and home station.)
       8.6.3.14. Prior to off-station mission or deployment maintenance technicians will obtain suffi-
       cient fuels transaction forms to complete the mission/deployment. Unless directed otherwise by
       the PIC, accurately complete all ground refueling/de-fueling documents and place them inside the
       AF IMT 664.
       8.6.3.15. Wing scheduling will:
           8.6.3.15.1. Provide a member to the AVPOL advisory group.
           8.6.3.15.2. By the 7th of each month, prepare monthly report for invoice control officer
           (ICO). Include organization (squadron), MDS, programmed flying hours for previous and cur-
           rent months in the report.
           8.6.3.15.3. Include receivers’ MDS, command of assignment, unit or squadron, DoDAAC for
           USAF receivers, UIC for USN receivers, POC name and phone number, and home station
           name (for each in-flight refueling sortie) on the weekly schedule.
           8.6.3.15.4. Maintain the wing’s current master list of receiver unit POCs and telephone num-
           bers.

8.7. AF IMT 4091, Flight Engineer’s Worksheet. The AF IMT 4091 is a tool to record pertinent facts
during mission planning, preflight, in-flight, and post-flight operations. Record tail numbers using 8-dig-
its. Submit this form with post mission paperwork.

8.8. AMC Form 54 (IMT-V1), Aircraft Commander’s Report on Services/Facilities. T h e A M C
Form 54 is a tool to report level of excellence for services encountered during mobility operations. Be
quick to identify outstanding performers and attempt to resolve problems at lowest level practical. PICs
should advise affected agency on their intent to submit an AMC Form 54. Provide a copy of the com-
pleted form to local station AMC C2 agency. Upon return to home station, PICs will coordinate form with
SQ/CC and OG/CC. For Forms 54 that require AMC coordination, OG/CCs shall review and submit
AMC Form 54 to 18AF/CC.

     9.2.1. Initial qualification, re-qualification, or upgrade training for pilots will not be conducted with
     passengers onboard. Mission qualification training may be conducted on missions with passengers
     onboard only if the individual in training is qualified (completed aircraft checkride with valid AF IMT
     8).
     9.2.2. Touch-and-go landings are prohibited with passengers onboard (N/A MEGP).
     9.2.3. Multiple practice approaches will not be accomplished with passengers onboard.
     EXCEPTION: When approved by the MAJCOM, maintenance and civilian employees, under direct
     contract to the DoD and engaged in official direct mission support activities, considered “mission
     essential” may be onboard when touch-and-go or stop-and-go landings are performed providing the
     mission is a designated training flight and an IP or EP is in command.

9.3. Touch-and-Go Landing Limitations.
     9.3.1. Touch-and-go landings will only be accomplished under the direct supervision of an IP/EP or
     SQ/CC certified AC. Refer to AFI 11-2KC-10V1 for certification requirements.
     9.3.2. An in-flight evaluation is required prior to pilots accomplishing touch-and-go landings without
     direct IP supervision. The evaluation should occur in conjunction with the initial qualification evalua-
     tion. After successful evaluation, pilots must be evaluated on recurring evaluations to maintain
     touch-and-go qualification.
     9.3.3. Limitations.
        9.3.3.1. Comply with all flight manual restrictions and procedures.
        9.3.3.2. Use a runway of sufficient length and width to permit a safe, normal, full-stop landing.
        9.3.3.3. Minimum ceiling of 600 ft and minimum visibility of 2 miles (300 ft and 3/4 miles (RVR
        40) for IPs).
        9.3.3.4. Wet runway, or RCR must be a measured 8 or higher
        9.3.3.5. Do not accomplish touch-and-go landings on slush covered runways.
        9.3.3.6. Maximum crosswind component is 15 knots (20 knots for IPs).
        9.3.3.7. The center gear will be extended for touch-and-go landings.
        9.3.3.8. Passengers or cargo will not be carried during touch-and-go operations or multiple prac-
        tice approaches.
            9.3.3.8.1. Static display box, tow bar, tie-down equipment box, engine covers, crew baggage,
            and empty pallet sub-flooring are not considered cargo.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                  97


      9.3.3.9. A minimum of 9 wheel brakes must be operational. Anti-skid on all operational wheel
      brakes must be functioning normally.
   9.3.4. Supervision of touch-and-go landings. Review the following:
      9.3.4.1. Flight manual procedures.
      9.3.4.2. Importance of smooth application of power to the touch-and-go N1 setting while main-
      taining symmetric thrust as the throttles are advanced.
      9.3.4.3. Engine failure, including recognition and corrective action.
      9.3.4.4. Proper use of spoilers, flaps, and trim.

9.4. Training on Operational Missions.
   9.4.1. Crews may perform multiple approaches and touch-and-go landings on operational (TWCF)
   and TACC directed missions provided the following requirements are met:
      9.4.1.1. Normal touch-and-go limitations apply and MEGPs are briefed of the activity.
      9.4.1.2. All transition training will be accomplished during the first 12 hours of the FDP only.
      9.4.1.3. Pre-mission coordination requirements. As part of pre-mission planning, PICs will con-
      tact parent wing current operations and obtain training mission number(s) for use at each en route
      location(s) where training events are planned. In addition, aircraft commanders will coordinate
      with and receive approval from unit OG/CC and the airfield(s) where training is to be accom-
      plished. They will then coordinate with the TACC to ensure adequate ground time is available at
      planned training locations to allow for planned training events, clearing customs, required crew
      rest, etc. Once complete, wing current operations will coordinate with TACC to re-cut the mission
      and add the training mission number(s) in GDSS/C2IPS.
      9.4.1.4. Upon initial arrival at the training location, close out the current line on the AFTO IMT
      781 and log the training time on the next line using the appropriate training mission symbol and
      number.
   9.4.2. Crews may accomplish aerial refueling training on operational missions provided applicable
   items of 9.4.1.3. and the following requirements are met:
      9.4.2.1. All mission-required fuel is on-loaded prior to commencing any training.
      9.4.2.2. Passengers and MEGPs are briefed of the activity.

9.5. Simulated Emergency Flight Procedures.
   9.5.1. Unless specifically authorized elsewhere in this section, do not practice emergency procedures
   that degrade aircraft performance or flight control capabilities (in-flight).
   9.5.2. In an actual emergency, terminate all training and flight maneuvers practice. Training should
   be resumed only when the PIC determines it is safe.

9.6. Not Used.

9.7. Flight Maneuvers.

        to applicable training regulation) and tactical maneuvers specified in AFTTP 3-3.22A or specifi-
        cally authorized by HQ AMC. Minimum altitude for bank angles greater than 30 degrees is 10,000
        feet AGL.
     9.7.2. The following maneuvers are authorized for qualification and continuation training. They are
     applicable to all KC-10 aircraft except when prohibited by or restricted by the flight manual or other
     current directives. The pilot or IP will alert all crew members prior to accomplishing the following:
        9.7.2.1. Steep Turns. NOTE: IP supervision is required when performing steep turns in the air-
        craft. Maximum aircraft gross weight for steep turn training is 450,000 pounds.
        9.7.2.2. Landing Attitude Demonstration (direct IP supervision).
        9.7.2.3. Slow Speed Refueling Demonstration (may be performed in-flight according to applica-
        ble training instructions. Perform at a minimum altitude of 10,000 feet AGL. Initial and re- quali-
        fication students will perform “Slow Speed Tanker Refueling Demonstration” under direct IP
        supervision. Intentional flights at speeds less than 1.2g or initial buffet onset is prohibited. Inten-
        tional in-flight demonstration of stick shaker activation or buffet onset is prohibited.

9.8. Training/Evaluation Briefing. Before all training/evaluation missions, aircraft commanders or
instructors/flight examiners should brief their crew on the following additional items:
     9.8.1. Training/Evaluation requirements. Instructors/evaluators (for each crew position) will outline
     requirements and objectives for each student or examinee.
     9.8.2. Planned training area and seat changes.

9.9. Debriefing. Review and evaluate overall training performed. Each student or aircrew member
should understand thoroughly what training has been accomplished. Ensure all training is documented.

9.10. Simulated Instrument Flight. Artificial vision restricting devices are not authorized for any phase
of flight. Simulated instrument flight may be flown and logged without the use of a vision-restricting
device.

9.11. Operating Limitations. The following restrictions apply:
     9.11.1. Planned Go-Arounds and Visual Low Approaches. Initiate a planned go-around or missed
     approach not later than:
        9.11.1.1. Precision approach--DH (or 200-feet HAT, whichever is higher).
        9.11.1.2. Non-precision approach--missed approach point (MAP).
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 99


       9.11.1.3. Visual approach or VFR pattern--100 feet AGL.
NOTE: Does not preclude landing attitude demonstration.
   9.11.2. Landings. The following limitations apply to touch-and-go and full-stop landings:
       9.11.2.1. Flap setting - Do not practice landings with less than 35 flaps.
       9.11.2.2. Multiple full-stop landings - Compute brake energy prior to each subsequent takeoff.
9.12. (Added-TRAVIS) 60th Air Mobility Wing (AMW) and 349th AMW Local Procedures. T h i s
supplement applies to all assigned and attached Travis AFB aircrews that participate in KC-10A flight
operations.
   9.12.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Mission Planning.
       9.12.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) All KC-10 sorties should be mission planned no later than the duty
       day prior to the sortie. Accomplish a computer flight plan using Portable Flight Planning System
       (PFPS) to check mission timing and fuel requirements for all sorties outside of the local radar pat-
       tern. Coordinate training and formation requirements, if applicable. Check crew currency products
       for overdue items. Review the Operational Risk Management (ORM) Aircraft Commander Risk
       Assessment worksheet. Confirm all crewmembers have been notified and phone numbers on the
       mission set-up sheet are correct.
       9.12.1.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Air Refueling Coordination. Crews should make every effort to con-
       tact tanker and receiver units to pre-coordinate training or evaluation requirements. When sched-
       uled to air refuel with a Travis AFB tanker or receiver and prior coordination is unsuccessful,
       attempt contact on Travis Command Post frequency - UHF 349.4 (Preset Channel 11) during pre-
       flight activity.
       9.12.1.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Confirming Mission Fuel Loads. Aircraft commanders (or flight
       planner-349 AMW) will verify scheduled fuel load on all missions and locals and coordinate
       changes to fuel loads NLT 1600L the day prior to flight.
       9.12.1.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Planning Fuel Reserves.
          9.12.1.4.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Local sorties not requiring an alternate should plan on having
          25,000 lbs. of useable fuel at the IAF (Req’d O/H Dest). Useable fuel does not include any
          identified trapped body tank fuel. It also does not include any ballast fuel required to prevent
          exceeding CG limits (Wing Air Refueling Pod (WARP) modified aircraft). When an alternate
          is not required, the flight engineer will document 10K additional overhead fuel requirement in
          the alternate block of AF Form 4091, Mission Data Worksheet. A time is not required in this
          block if an alternate is not required.
          9.12.1.4.2. (Added-TRAVIS) For local sorties requiring an alternate, insert the required
          alternate fuel and time in the alternate block of section 34. To standardize the IAF fuel figure
          of 25K lbs. of useable fuel, do not place less than 10K in the alternate block.
       9.12.1.5. (Added-TRAVIS) The AF Form 4091 is designed to combine mission information on a
       single worksheet for mission planning, preflight, in-flight, and post-flight activity. Time/Fuel
       Analysis portion of AF Form 4091 meets the fuel planning requirements of AFI 11-202, V3, Gen-
       eral Flight Rules. Prior to engine start, aircraft commanders will coordinate destination alternate
       requirements with the flight engineer, review and initial section 34 on the IMT 4091.

           9. (Added) Do not use alternate divert fuel for normal cruise unless all planning factors are
              met
           9.12.1.6.1. (Added-TRAVIS) The above fuel computations do not alleviate aircrew responsi-
           bility for checking indirect routings, weather, NOTAMS, stronger than normal winds, WARP
           drag index, and cruising at hemispheric altitudes, when planning an alternate airfield fuel
           requirement.
      9.12.1.7. (Added-TRAVIS) PFPS Guidance. For drag index on computer flight plans, use figure
      1-14 in T.O. 1C-10(K) A-1-1, Flight Manual Performance Data. There is additional PFPS infor-
      mation available on the Travis AFB Crewdog Web Page at https://w3.travis.af.mil/crewdog.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 101


        9.12.1.7.1. (Added-TRAVIS) For WARP aircraft change your empty gross weight from
        250,000 to 255,000 pounds. When alerted to a WARP installed aircraft, complete a new flight
        plan at show time using the correct weights and drag indexes. If a new fuel load is required,
        notify Command Post as soon as possible.
        9.12.1.7.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Double the drag index for WARP configurations since there
        are two pods installed on an aircraft. Therefore, the drag index for a clean wing with the hose
        and drogue retracted is 10. The drag index for a clean wing with the hose and drogue deployed
        is 27.
        9.12.1.7.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Use a drag index of 18.5 for tanker air refueling (16.5 - boom
        deployed, 2.0 - sighting door open).
        9.12.1.7.4. (Added-TRAVIS) For slow speed air refueling with slats or slats/flaps extended,
        the drag index does not apply since the aircraft is now in a flight envelope that PFPS does not
        recognize. Use the “Manual” cruise flight mode under these circumstances. Set the fuel flow
        to 23,000 lbs/hr for any slow speed AR below 510,000 lbs. gross weight and 27,000 lb/hr for
        gross weight above 510,000 lbs. requiring the slats or slats/flaps to be extended.
        9.12.1.7.5. (Added-TRAVIS) For receiver air refueling use a drag index of 44 from the
        ARCP to AR Exit point.
        9.12.1.7.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Use a manual fuel burn of 18,000 lbs/hr during transition.
        9.12.1.7.7. (Added-TRAVIS) When using the Navy Wind PFPS Route utility, set the takeoff
        date and time in PFPS before requesting en route wind data. Even though the Navy utility
        allows you to change the date within their software, it doesn't always change it, and may result
        in improper winds applied to your route. You will know the wrong winds were applied by see-
        ing the wrong hour forecast message or a message stating climatologic winds were applied
        when it should be a 6-hour incremental forecast.
  9.12.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Transition Training.
     9.12.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Off-station transition may be accomplished at any military airfield
     or joint use airfield. (349th OG: requires Sq/DO or higher authority approval for military airfields
     not listed in this chapter). Additionally, transition may be accomplished at any civil base listed in
     the subsequent paragraphs. Approval authority for transition at civil fields not listed in this chapter
     is the squadron operations officer, Flight Training Unit (FTU) Chief, or higher authority. The fol-
     lowing paragraphs contain additional restrictions not published in the Airfield Suitability Report
     and Restrictions (ASRR), DOD FLIP, etc. This information is additional guidance (subject to
     change without prior notice), and does not preclude the need for thorough mission planning and
     airfield study. Aircraft commanders will review NOTAMs, IFR Supplement, AP/1, bird avoid-
     ance models and the ASRR for the transition field. Use Noise Abatement procedures to the maxi-
     mum extent possible at all off-station transition bases.
        9.12.2.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Travis AFB. Runways at Travis AFB are not grooved or
        porous. Therefore, the standard RCR is 10 for takeoff and eight (8) for landing when the run-
        way is wet. There is a priority system during the periods of limited aircraft in the pattern. If
        there is a conflict concerning the number of aircraft in the pattern, ATC will send one aircraft
        into holding, and inform Command Post of the situation. Command Post will contact aircraft
        in the pattern to determine priority and inform ATC of the lowest priority aircraft. The aircraft
102                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


             with the lowest priority will make intentions known to ATC and Command Post (full stop,
             depart area, hold, or full stop to taxi-back). If departing Travis due to pattern saturation, advise
             Travis Command Post of intentions.

             Transition training is permitted on a case-by-case basis. The PAR is not normally available on
             weekends and after 2200L during the week. Do not over fly the Pave Paws radar site east of
             the field. Coordinate with Beale Command Post or Supervisor of Flying (SOF – 139.9/
             240.225) to avoid conflict with priority traffic.
             9.12.2.1.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Redding MAP. Low approach approved only. Avoid over
             flight of residential housing. For non-precision approaches, plan your arrival at MDA to avoid
             prolonged low altitude flight at high power settings. Hours of operation are 0630-2130.
             9.12.2.1.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Sacramento International Airport (SMF). Available between
             0700L and 1900L, Monday through Friday only. Only one heavy aircraft at SMF at a time.
             Approach work is limited to one hour total in the radar and/or VFR pattern maximum. Do not
             overfly the tower and passenger terminal areas. Circling maneuvers for training are not autho-
             rized. Plan instrument approaches to 16L/34R when available. If non-precision approaches are
             flown, plan your arrival at MDA to avoid prolonged low altitude flight at high power settings.
             When executing climb out from an IFR or VFR approach (Runway 16R), start your turn
             immediately after crossing the I-5 freeway to cross the river south of the I-5 bridge. Coordi-
             nate with TRACON to fly a flight path west of the homes located along the river. Call North-
             ern California TRACON (916) 336-4001, prior to departing Travis to determine SMF arrival/
             departure workload limitations. Aircrews are limited to a MAXIMUM of one hour in the pat-
             tern and must avoid overflying residences along the river to the west. Pilots are responsible for
             monitoring time in traffic and departing the airfield after reaching the one-hour time con-
             straint. ATC controllers may be willing to clear you for more than the allotted time. Do not
             overfly the one hour of allotted time.
             9.12.2.1.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Sacramento Mather Airport (MHR). Available between 0700L
             and 1900L, Monday through Friday only. No more than one heavy aircraft at MHR at a time.
             Approach work is limited to one hour total in the radar and/or VFR pattern maximum. No
             more than two touch and go landings per aircraft due to deteriorating runway pavement. Do
             not overfly the tower. Delay configuration on instrument approaches (but maintain within safe
             parameters at all times). Do not fly ‘50 flap’ approaches. Flap configuration in the VFR pattern
             is not restricted unless flying a significantly extended pattern (final longer than 3 miles). Cir-
             cling maneuvers for training are not authorized. If non-precision approaches are flown, plan
             your arrival at MDA to avoid prolonged low altitude flight at high power settings. When inter-
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                  103


          cepting final for the ILS/visual Runway 22L approach, plan your turn to intercept final at or
          south of US 50. Avoid overflying residential areas north of US 50. Call Northern California
          TRACON (916) 366-4001, extension 222 prior to departing Travis to determine MHR arrival/
          departure workload limitations. Aircrews are limited to a MAXIMUM of one hour in the pat-
          tern and must avoid overflying noise sensitive areas to the north and northeast of 22L final
          approach course. Pilots are responsible for monitoring time in traffic and departing the airfield
          after reaching the one-hour time constraint. ATC controllers may be willing to clear you for
          more than the allotted time. Do not overfly the one hour of allotted time.
          9.12.2.1.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Stockton MAP. Airfield hours for transition are 0800-1500
          Local. Expedite climb for noise abatement. Remain at or above 1500 feet MSL within 15 NM
          of Sharpe AAF (4 1/2 miles south of the airport). Do not over fly San Joaquin General Hospi-
          tal (1 1/2 miles northwest of the airport) or the city of Manteca (2 miles south of the airport).
          Normal transition is on Runway 29R. Requests for circling approaches or transition outside of
          the 0800-1500L window can be made with the airfield manager.
          9.12.2.1.7. (Added-TRAVIS) Palmdale (AF Plant 42). Runway 25 is approved for IMC and
          nighttime operations provided the ILS is operational and flown. Runways 4, 7 and 22 are
          restricted to Day/VMC operations.
          9.12.2.1.8. (Added-TRAVIS) Vandenberg AFB, CA.
          9.12.2.1.9. (Added-TRAVIS) NAS Lemoore, CA.
          9.12.2.1.10. (Added-TRAVIS) NAS Fallon, NV.
          9.12.2.1.11. (Added-TRAVIS) Edwards AFB, CA. During transition stay within R-2515.
          Flight through R-2508 will be avoided.
       9.12.2.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Transition with Cargo. Cargo will not be carried during
       touch-and-go’s and/or multiple practice approaches. Static display box, tow-bar, tie-down equip-
       ment box, engine covers, and empty pallet sub-flooring are not considered cargo.
       9.12.2.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Transition on Operational Missions. Normally, touch-and-go land-
       ings will not be performed on operational missions. However, touch-and-go’s may be performed
       for currency on the deployment or redeployment legs only if it does not affect mission accom-
       plishment. There are several areas to consider before doing a touch-and-go, i.e., brake/tire wear,
       antiskid operation, passengers and/or cargo, etc.
NOTE: (Added) Off-station transition on operational missions will not be conducted without 60 OG/CC
(349OG/CC for AFRC) approval.
       9.12.2.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Tactics training is authorized at the following airfields: Travis AFB,
       NAS Lemoore, NAS Fallon, Beale AFB, Palmdale, Vandenberg AFB, Al Dhafra AB, and Diego
       Garcia NSF. If tactics training is conducted off-station, coordinate with the airfield prior to depar-
       ture. Tactics training is encouraged primarily at Travis AFB.
       9.12.2.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Unauthorized Transition Airfields. Transition training is not autho-
       rized within the San Francisco Class B Airspace. These airfields include Metropolitan Oakland
       IAP, Moffett Field Federal Airport and San Francisco IAP.
   9.12.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Local Procedures.
104                                                AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


      9.12.3.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Engine Start Procedures for Parking Spots 516/517/518. Aircraft
      parked in spots 516 and 518 must be towed prior to engine start. Crews will not start the #2 engine
      in spot 517. Heavy aircraft requiring all three engines to taxi will be towed out of spot 517 prior to
      engine start.
      9.12.3.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Parking Spots/Jet Blast. The first 90-degree turn out of parking spots
      412, 422, and 432 are located on the edge of the ramp next to the fuel pump area and several build-
      ings subjecting these buildings to potentially hazardous conditions if more than idle power is used.
      Loose gravel next to the ramp may blow into the buildings and damage them or any personnel that
      might be in the area. Use the following procedures when taxing off these spots:
         9.12.3.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Carry enough speed into the first turn so that power above idle
         is not required.
         9.12.3.2.2. (Added-TRAVIS) If, in the pilots opinion, the turn cannot be completed with idle
         power (due to heavy gross weight, etc., the aircraft should be towed out of the parking spot).
      9.12.3.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Do not taxi between spots H-13 and H-14 (Hot Cargo Pads). The
      area is not stressed for KC-10s.
      9.12.3.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Per Travis AFB MXGOI 21-116 paragraph 5.1.2., KC-10 parking
      spots 210, 211, 212A, 220, 221, 222A, 230, 231, 232, 261, 262, 271, 272A, 281, 282, 290, 291,
      292, support equipment boxes will only contain the following equipment during aircraft launch
      and recovery actions: B1-1 and B-5 stands, one power unit, fire bottle and required aircraft
      chocks.
      9.12.3.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Controlled Takeoff Times. Aircrews may coordinate with Travis
      Command Post for controlled takeoff times. If a mission is falling behind in the pre-launch
      sequence of events, Travis Command Post will coordinate the takeoff priority with ground and
      tower control, and advise the aircrew. Inform Ground Control of the controlled takeoff time at
      request for engine start.
      9.12.3.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Monitoring Command Post Radios in the Local Pattern. Crews will
      monitor Command Post's UHF frequency (349.4) in-flight (normally a crewmember other than the
      pilots in primary crew positions). Block times, MX status, checking on tanker/receiver status, etc.,
      will be made on UHF.
      9.12.3.7. (Added-TRAVIS) Traffic Advisory Procedures for Travis TACAN A and B
      Approaches. All aircrews flying the Travis TACAN A or B approaches (or otherwise operating in
      the vicinity of Rio Vista Airport) will make every effort to self-announce their aircraft position
      and/or intentions on the UNICOM frequency. Example: (called in-the-blind on 122.8 approaching
      lead radial to final approach course on TACAN-A) "Rio Vista traffic, Quest 52, heavy KC-10, 2
      miles south of Rio Vista airport, 3000 feet, descending to 1800 feet, turning west to Travis AFB,
      for Rio Vista traffic.” Use generic VFR terminology to relay your position relative to Rio Vista
      Airport. Using an additional crewmember to make these radio calls will minimize distraction from
      normal duties.
      9.12.3.8. (Added-TRAVIS) Mid-Air Collision Potential. The heavy congestion in the Travis
      traffic pattern requires extreme vigilance from every crewmember. High volume VFR traffic to
      and from airports in the area and along I-80 requires dedicated clearing. VFR flight activity
      increases on weekends.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                105


     9.12.3.9. (Added-TRAVIS) Radio Terminology. "To Follow" and "Traffic Is” is terminology
     used frequently by Travis Approach Control to convey your position in traffic sequencing. You
     will always be turning behind the traffic, regardless of runway, unless specifically cleared other-
     wise (e.g., terminology such as “traffic is...turn inside of that traffic” may be used). The following
     information is provided:
        9.12.3.9.1. (Added-TRAVIS) “TO FOLLOW” - Informs a pilot to follow an aircraft that is
        making an approach to the same Runway. Example: “Quest 42, number 2 to follow a heavy
        C-5, 4 mile final, Runway 21L. Report base behind that traffic.” Your instructions are that you
        are number two behind a C-5 to the same Runway 21L.
        9.12.3.9.2. (Added-TRAVIS) “TRAFFIC IS” - Informs a pilot to follow an aircraft that is
        making an approach to a different runway. Example: "Orca 33, you’re number one, 21L, traf-
        fic is a heavy C-5 5 mile final 21R. Report base 21L behind that traffic.” You are the first air-
        plane to 21L but will turn behind the C-5 going to 21R.
     9.12.3.10. (Added-TRAVIS) Local Mission Cancellation/Termination. Mission cancellation
     authority rests with the flying squadron leadership (Operations Officer for 60 AMW; Aircraft
     Commander for 349 AMW). Coordinate early termination through Travis Command Post. Sorties
     may be terminated prior to scheduled duration if training is complete. Aircraft commanders will
     obtain approval from Travis Command Post if they wish to continue flying beyond scheduled
     landing time.
     9.12.3.11. (Added-TRAVIS) Thunderstorm and Lightning at Travis AFB.
        9.12.3.11.1. (Added-TRAVIS) In accordance with Travis AFBI 15-101, Weather, and
        AFOSHSTD 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line - Ground Operations and Activities, the Travis Base
        Weather Station will issue thunderstorm and lightning activity weather information through
        command post, tower and ATIS. A Weather Watch for Lightning is issued 30 minutes prior to
        thunderstorm activity within a 5 NM radius of Travis AFB. A Weather Warning for Lightning
        is issued when lightning is observed within 5 NM of Travis AFB.
        9.12.3.11.2. (Added-TRAVIS) During a Weather Warning for Lightning, personnel in
        affected locations will cease all outside activities and seek shelter. Enclosed aircraft, buses and
        other vehicles with metal tops and bodies are considered suitable shelter during thunderstorm
        activity. Wheel wells are extremely hazardous during thunderstorms and should be avoided.
        9.12.3.11.3. (Added-TRAVIS) In accordance with 660 AGS MOI 21-107, Severe or Inclem-
        ent Weather, when lightning is within 5 NM, maintenance will stop all flight line operations
        and evacuate the flight line until the termination of the lightning hazard. Furthermore, AVPOL
        will cease all fueling operations.
        9.12.3.11.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrews that have not arrived at the aircraft will remain
        indoors or in the crew bus until the lightning threat passes. Crews will be notified of the light-
        ning threat by the most expeditious means (e.g., maintenance truck, crew chiefs, or command
        post). If already at the aircraft, the crew will remain in the aircraft with all doors closed and at
        least one door armed for emergency evacuation. The crew may continue interior preflight
        duties (up to engine start) while awaiting lightning hazard passage. In the event an aircraft
        lands during lightning threat periods, the tower will direct taxi operations. The crew can
        expect parking delays upon clearing the runway.
106                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


         9.12.3.12. (Added-TRAVIS) Fire Department Frequency. When an aircraft notifies tower of an
         IFE requiring fire department response, the tower should pass the emergency aircraft to the fire
         department frequency (349.7) after the aircraft has come to a complete stop. Aircrews will moni-
         tor/use this frequency to coordinate actions with the on-scene Fire Chief. Aircrews will also
         remain on the tower/ground control frequency until the emergency has been terminated.
      9.12.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrew Procedures.
         9.12.4.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircraft Taxi/Observer Procedures. Aircraft commanders requesting
         the assistance of a crewmember to monitor the taxi from a forward (1 L/R) or mid-cabin (2 L/R)
         door should not commence taxiing until communications are established and cleared to taxi by the
         observer. Open the door only as much as required to safely monitor taxi. Taxi observer will not
         stand or kneel directly in front of door opening.
         9.12.4.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Use of UHF Radios. UHF radio frequencies should be used to the
         maximum extent possible when conducting transition at Travis AFB. This does not preclude the
         use of VHF radios when specifically assigned one by ATC, nor does it preclude VHF radio use for
         safety reasons, training, etc.
         9.12.4.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Crews must review maintenance write-ups and aircraft forms to
         ensure accurate reporting of maintenance problems. Specifically, any write-up requiring
         engine-runs, aircraft jacking, or towing must be relayed through command post to ensure a proper
         parking location is assigned. When in doubt as to the need of special parking, ask command post
         to relay the problem to a maintenance supervisor for guidance. This will alleviate the need to tow
         or double-block airplanes incorrectly assigned to parking spots unsuitable for the required mainte-
         nance. Communication by aircraft commanders to the command post is key to a speedy recovery
         of airplanes requiring maintenance upon return to Travis AFB.
         9.12.4.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Seat changes for primary crewmembers will not begin on departure
         until the aircraft reaches 1,000 feet AGL. Seat changes will not be made during flap extension or
         retraction.
         9.12.4.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Crews will ensure that the headset communications cord is con-
         nected through the oxygen mask communications cord during operations in all primary crew posi-
         tions (including the ARO). In the event that an oxygen crew communications cord is inoperative,
         attempt to switch quick-don masks. Write-up the problem in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
         Discrepancy Sheet, and annotate the mask control number in the write up. This enables Life Sup-
         port to easily identify the faulty mask. Plugging the headset communications cord directly into the
         communications panel is not permitted.
         9.12.4.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Opportune Air Refueling/Cargo Missions. Aircrews will contact
         Current Operations, 60OSS/OSO, before requesting opportune missions from TACC that will
         extend the TDY beyond the scheduled return time (SRT) to de-conflict scheduling of the crew/air-
         craft.
         9.12.4.7. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircraft commanders will ensure the main landing gear chocks are
         in place prior to the release of the parking brake. The ground crew may chock the nose wheel dur-
         ing initial parking as an additional safety measure, but are required to advise the aircrew when the
         main landing gear chocks are in place. The nose wheel chock, by itself, does not adequately satisfy
         the chocking requirement of the aircraft.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                               107


     9.12.4.8. (Added-TRAVIS) Seat Release for Space-A PAX. Aircraft commanders are responsi-
     ble for ensuring command post is aware of any requirements that would preclude Space-A travel.
     This can be done during mission planning by calling air operations and having them put remarks
     in the MIS. Unless you call command post and let them know you will not be releasing seats, they
     will automatically release seats to passengers for any mission departing Travis for off-station des-
     tinations. Refer to AMCI 11-208 regarding seat release policy for AMC aircraft. Aircraft com-
     manders will provide the CP or AMCC personnel with timely information concerning planned
     destination(s), number of seats available, and departure time for the next mission. They will, in
     turn, relay this information to ATOC.
     9.12.4.9. (Added-TRAVIS) Final Passenger Count. The Passenger Terminal does not normally
     have a final passenger count until 1+40 prior to takeoff. Passenger numbers can be requested from
     Command Post prior to that time, but critical decisions that may impact mission accomplishment
     should only be based upon the final passenger count. Questions regarding the passenger count, or
     if a baggage pallet will be used, should be directed to Command Post.
     9.12.4.10. (Added-TRAVIS) Off-station Logistics Support.
        9.12.4.10.1. (Added-TRAVIS) The TACC Logistic Group Readiness Control (LGRC) is the
        AMC logistics component of the command and control system that works in unison with the
        director of operations and mission management. AMC TACC/LGRC will support all KC-10A
        aircraft that are Non Mission Capable (NMC) away from home station.
        9.12.4.10.2. (Added-TRAVIS) For operational matters, coordinate with the appropriate
        TACC operations directorate. For logistics support call LGRC. When at non-AMC locations,
        direct contact with the TACC is appropriate. LGRC will evaluate and pass information from
        this call (i.e., request for parts, MRT or equipment) to the home station through the appropriate
        base Maintenance Airlift Control Center (MACC) that is tasked to support the aircraft recov-
        ery.
        9.12.4.10.3. (Added-TRAVIS) LGRC has overall responsibility for recovery of NMC air-
        craft from the time of notification until the aircraft is in the “green”. Therefore, aircrews must
        ensure the LGRC is kept in the loop regarding maintenance status, recovery options, and
        actions. Allow LGRC the opportunity to aid in resolving the problem.
  9.12.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Formation.
     9.12.5.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Formation procedures will be IAW Chapter 18 of this instruction,
     T.O. 1-1C-1-32, Flight Crew Air Refueling Procedures, and T.O. 1-1C-1-33, Flight Crew Tanker
     Air Refueling Procedures. The following guidelines will be used for flight planning:
        9.12.5.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) All aircraft departing Travis AFB in formation will file depar-
        tures to the Williams (ILA) VORTAC. Formations with activity scheduled to the south should
        file to the Williams (ILA) VORTAC and then to the next flight planned fix. The formation
        leader will not request clearance off of the departure and direct to the next position for timing
        purposes prior to cell breakup.
        9.12.5.1.2. (Added-TRAVIS) When operating in the Oakland ARTCC, do not request a
        breakup clearance until at final level-off altitude and at or beyond the ILA VORTAC. The
        transition between the Oakland low sector controller and high sector controller begins at
        FL230. FL210B230 is normally the highest level-off block for the low sector and FL240B260
108                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


            is the lowest available for the high sector. Crews should plan final level-off altitudes to ensure
            all cell members are in position and at the filed level-off altitude prior to the breakup fix.
            9.12.5.1.3. (Added-TRAVIS) When planning a formation departure using a departure transi-
            tion point, followed by direct to another point that is also a departure transition point (e.g.,
            TEALL1.ILA FMG), ARTCC computers may override your request and issue you the depar-
            ture that takes you to the second point (e.g., TEALL1.FMG). Request that Clearance Delivery
            amend the clearance.
            9.12.5.1.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Los Angeles Center requests formations that intend to
            break-up at the southern end of the Beatty corridor plan to do so prior to the Beatty VORTAC.
            In all cases, avoid break-ups at or near the Boulder City VORTAC where traffic is heavy. If an
            aircraft needs to depart the formation and return north, you should depart the formation but
            continue to the Boulder City area and take one of the following two options:
                9.12.5.1.4.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Turn Southwest towards Hector VORTAC and proceed
                to Palmdale, Shafter, and proceed northbound.
                9.12.5.1.4.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Turn Northeast towards KSINO on J107 then proceed
                north, east of the restricted areas.
                9.12.5.1.4.3. (Added-TRAVIS) In all cases, avoid 180 degree turns near Boulder City
                VORTAC.
                9.12.5.1.4.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Minimize the altitude blocks as much as possible from
                Beatty to Peach Springs
            9.12.5.1.5. (Added-TRAVIS) When accomplishing random air refueling advise the ARTCC
            of your intended point of termination and end air refueling request.
         9.12.5.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Sympathetic Delays and Alternate Missions. The formation leader
         will thoroughly brief a contingency plan should any aircraft in the formation be unable to make the
         scheduled takeoff time. This also applies to briefing alternate missions in the event the scheduled
         activity changes. Aircraft commanders should give copies of their flight plans to all other aircraft
         commanders. This will allow all crews to fly any mission if cancellations dictate. Aircraft com-
         manders not qualified to be lead aircraft will notify the lead aircraft commander during mission
         planning.
         9.12.5.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Communications. All aircrews should accomplish HAVE QUICK
         (P260) and Secure Voice (P270) on formation local training missions. Unauthorized UHF fre-
         quencies will not be used to conduct HAVE QUICK and/or Secure Voice training (e.g., 300.0 or
         300.025) IAW the Federal Communication Commission (FCC). Travis has the frequencies 311.0
         and 321.0 available for this training. The approved VHF interplane frequencies for Travis KC-10s
         are: Primary - 138.875 and Secondary - 139.925 (use the secondary frequency when transiting the
         Beatty corridor to avoid radio interference).
      9.12.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Non-Engine Running Crew Change (NERCC) Missions.
         9.12.6.1. (Added-TRAVIS) NERCCs are missions where crews are changed in minimum time
         between landing and subsequent takeoff. Plan a one-hour ground time for taxi in, crew change,
         and taxi out. Hold maintenance involvement to an absolute minimum (i.e., check aircraft, assist
         crews in changeover, etc.). Missions involving aircrew qualification training (FTU) and AFI

     11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, evaluations should not be
     scheduled for the second half of a NERCC mission. NERCC missions will be annotated on the
     weekly flying schedule.
     9.12.6.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Inbound Crew. Prior to landing, the inbound crew will advise Travis
     Command Post of their maintenance status, fuel status, gross weight, landing CG, and expected
     block time for coordination with the outbound crew. Leave the Flight Information Publications
     (FLIP) on the aircraft.
        9.12.6.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) The inbound boom operator will complete a Load Manage-
        ment Computer (LMC) strip tape or a DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance
        Form F, with actual fuel readings and the total number of outbound crewmembers verified
        through the Travis Command Post. Give both copies to the outbound boom operator. Com-
        plete the AF Form 791, Aerial Tanker In-flight Issue Log, if required, and turn in with the
        mission paperwork. The inbound boom operator will inform the outbound boom operator of
        the time since the boom hydraulic system was pressurized.
        9.12.6.2.2. (Added-TRAVIS) After starting the APU and parking the aircraft, the inbound
        crew will complete the Parking-Engine Shutdown Checklist, check the INU error rates, and
        align the INUs. Do not accomplish the Leaving Aircraft Checklist.
        9.12.6.2.3. (Added-TRAVIS) The inbound aircraft commander will close out the aircraft
        maintenance forms and brief the outbound aircraft commander on aircraft status. Maintenance
        personnel will complete an exceptional release, if required.
        9.12.6.2.4. (Added-TRAVIS) The inbound crew will not take the aircraft maintenance forms.
        The inbound crew will proceed to maintenance debrief to brief the status of the aircraft and
        receive a MMCS number on the AFTO Form 781, Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
        If the outbound crew is not at the aircraft when the inbound crew is ready to depart, the
        inbound aircraft commander or designee will remain at the aircraft until the outbound crew
        arrives.
     9.12.6.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Outbound Crew. Check aircraft status and fuel load with Travis
     Command Post, obtain parking spot, and expected block time. Additionally, the outbound aircraft
     commander will request the crew bus to wait for the inbound crew at the aircraft, if appropriate.
     9.12.6.4. (Added-TRAVIS) The outbound crew will meet the aircraft and receive a maintenance
     status update from the inbound crew. The outbound flight engineer will perform an exterior
     inspection and check the CAC. The entire outbound aircrew will perform interior inspection scans
     to verify proper switch positions. The Cockpit Preparation Checklist and subsequent normal
     checklists will be accomplished. The outbound aircrew is responsible for CG and TOLD calcula-
     tions. Consider brake temperatures when verifying takeoff data. The outbound aircraft com-
     mander will sign the DD Form 365-4.
  9.12.7. (Added-TRAVIS) C-Check Procedures.
     9.12.7.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Configurations. When aircraft are taken to "C" check, work orders
     sometimes require removal of specific equipment depending on whether the aircraft is to be
     weighed or not. If the aircraft is not to be weighed, only the maintenance T.O.s are removed from
     the crew chief box, all else remains onboard. If the aircraft is to be weighed the crew chief box will
     be empty except for 10 cargo straps and the doorsill conveyor. All fleet service equipment such as

      pillows, blankets, pax kits, and water jugs, along with all equipment in the California panel and
      other galley areas will be removed. Remaining onboard should be: the M.E.L., aircraft weight and
      balance book, 3 engine covers, and an empty pallet in 13L. Interior or exterior paint schedule may
      dictate removal of other items. It is advisable that all boom operators cross check the inventory
      worksheet prior to departure from home station to ensure actual aircraft inventory is reflected.
      (The worksheet will be included in the paperwork the pilot picks up from maintenance). This will
      save valuable time when the contractor checks inventory at the input station. Maintenance config-
      uration checklists account for the removal of the equipment listed above and the appropriate
      changes to the DD Form 365 Charts A and C. This enables the boom operator to compute an accu-
      rate Form F. Waivers are not required.

      9.12.7.2. (Added-TRAVIS) It is the responsibility of the crew chief, aircraft commander or des-
      ignated representative to notify the applicable squadron Aircrew Life Support when the crew com-
      pliment is larger than seven personnel in order to provide extra life support equipment for each
      squadron C-Check Input, as necessary. When the aircraft arrives at the C-Check facility, the air-
      craft commander or designated representative with the C-Check personnel will make every effort
      to insure that life support equipment is properly stored and returned to the designated aircraft upon
      completion of the C-Check.
      9.12.7.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Functional Check Flights (FCF). FCFs are conducted IAW T.O.

  9.12.8. (Added-TRAVIS) Fuel Procedures.
     9.12.8.1. (Added-TRAVIS) TDYs. When away from home station, all ground and in-flight fuel
     receipts will be placed in the AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documentation Log. This form is
     maintained in the aircraft forms binder. Write the aircraft commander’s name, rank, mission num-
     ber, squadron and date below the last entry on the AF Form 664. If the crew changes, the AC will
     draw a line under the last entry of his/her mission. Write “Last entry by Squadron on Date, Print
     Name and Rank” then sign entry. The crew taking over the aircraft will start entries on the next
     open line.
     9.12.8.2. (Added-TRAVIS) AVCARD Procedures.
        9.12.8.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Research the AVCARD Web site for “Government Into-Plane
        Contractor” at all commercial locations to ensure the lowest rate available. The AVCARD can
        be used to purchase all Fuel, Oil and Ground Services required during a mission.
        9.12.8.2.2. (Added-TRAVIS) The aircraft commander will ensure the AVCARD and inden-
        taplate are in the aircraft forms. If either card is not present at home station notify the mainte-
        nance supervisor. Maintenance supervision will order a new AVCARD prior to mission
        departure and provide the crew with a card number to use during the remainder of the mission.
        9.12.8.2.3. (Added-TRAVIS) If the card is lost en route, make an entry on the AF Form
        781A. Include all relevant details (e.g., “BP vendor at EGPK [Mr. Driver] misplaced card.
        Ensuing search failed to recover Card.”). If the card is missing from a deployed aircraft,
        inform maintenance and document the missing card in the 781As, stating that it was missing
        upon your arrival at the aircraft. Call 1-800-AVCARD-1; inform the AVCARD technician the
        AVCARD for your aircraft is lost. The technician will give you a card number to use for the
        remainder of the mission. Insure a new card is ordered upon mission return. Use the AF Form
        315, USAF Avfuels Invoice, and AF Form 15, USAF Invoice, only as required at subsequent
        stops.
        9.12.8.2.4. (Added-TRAVIS) If you cannot obtain a card or a card number and the fuel ven-
        dor will accept nothing else, call TACC and inform them of your situation.
     9.12.8.3. (Added-TRAVIS) AF Forms 15 and 315 Procedures (when not able to use AVCARD).
        9.12.8.3.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Trip kits issued by the squadron contain AF Forms 15, 315 and
        TRAVISAFBI 23-102, Aviation Fuels (AVPOL) Management Program. TRAVISAFBI
        23-102 contains guidance and instructions for using these forms. Aircraft Commanders and
        Flight Engineers should review AFI 23-202, Buying Petroleum Products and Other Supplies
        and Services Off-Station, and TRAVISAFBI 23-102 to ensure they understand the proper pro-
        cedures for completing and documenting aircraft fuel purchases.
     9.12.8.4. (Added-TRAVIS) JP-8 + 100 Fuel.
        9.12.8.4.1. (Added-TRAVIS) JP-8 + 100 is used for high temperature stability and cleans
        deposits in turbine engines. It is used at AETC, ACC, and ANG bases. JP-8 + 100 is not autho-
        rized for use in KC-10 aircraft. Bases issuing JP-8 + 100 have separated it from their normal
        “clean” fuel and are aware that transiting aircraft are not to receive this product.
        9.12.8.4.2. (Added-TRAVIS) If the onload of JP-8 + 100 is unavoidable due to an extreme
        operational necessity, the aircraft commander will sign an AFTO Form 148 (Acknowledge-
112                                                  AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


            ment Form presented by fuels personnel) prior to the fueling operation. If JP-8 + 100 is inad-
            vertently received or absolutely must be used, enter the quantity onloaded in the AFTO Form
            781A and notify HQ AMC/DOV via TACC for further guidance.
         9.12.8.5. (Added-TRAVIS) In-flight Fuel Jettisoning.
            9.12.8.5.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Fuel Jettisoning is done IAW prescribed technical orders,
            FAAO 7110.65, and MAJCOM directives, and accomplished clear of populated areas. Air-
            crew will coordinate with RAPCON/Oakland ARTCC for area and altitude. If the emergency
            dictates, the recommended fuel jettison holding pattern instructions within Travis airspace
            boundaries are Hold Northwest of the TZZ R-324, 16 DME Fix (N 38 30 10.00 W 121 52
            48.48), four min. (15 NM) legs. Altitudes 10,000 feet or below will allow aircraft to remain
            within Travis delegated airspace. Altitudes above 10,000 feet will require a clearance with
            Oakland ARTCC.
            9.12.8.5.2. (Added-TRAVIS) If the aircraft commander decides the situation does not war-
            rant fuel dumping in the local area, RAPCON will vector the aircraft to W-513, west of Sau-
            salito VORTAC. Oakland ARTCC will give clearance to enter. This area will keep the aircraft
            in the immediate vicinity of Travis; if the situation deteriorates further, an eastbound turn will
            place the aircraft on final for San Francisco International Airport. The coordinates for the cen-
            ter of this area are N37 50.0 W123 30.0.
            9.12.8.5.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Pilots will proceed to the selected fuel jettison area and deter-
            mine if the airspace below is clear of traffic. When jettisoning fuel, aircrews must comply with
            AFI 11-2KC-10 V3, paragraph 5.17.
            9.12.8.5.4. (Added-TRAVIS) When fuel dumping is necessary, the recommended fuel dump
            area will be used unless doing so compromises the safe recovery of the aircraft. If circum-
            stances prevent aircraft from utilizing the designated fuel dump area, every effort will be made
            (within safe operation) to dump off federal airways and away from urban areas, agricultural
            regions, or water supply sources.
            9.12.8.5.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Annotate amount of fuel jettisoned and a brief reason on an AF
            Form 791, reference TRAVISAFBI 23-102, Aviation Fuel Management Program.
      9.12.9. (Added-TRAVIS) Crew Communications.
         9.12.9.1. (Added-TRAVIS) On formation sorties, crews will check out a loaded KYK-13 that
         includes (if required): M4, Secure Voice, and HQUS.
         9.12.9.2. (Added-TRAVIS) For operational missions, coordinate with Crew Comm 24 hours in
         advance. Weekend and Monday departures will call NLT Friday 1200L. Crews will receive a
         KYK-13, a KOI-18 (loader), a cable, applicable COMSEC, the training guide (handout) and bat-
         teries.
         9.12.9.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Crewmembers picking up COMSEC from Crew Comm or Base Ops
         will have their ID card and flight orders available at pickup to expedite clearance verification.
      9.12.10. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircraft Documentation and Forms.
         9.12.10.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Life Support Documentation. All items on the AFTO Form 46,
         Pre-positioned Life Support Equipment (LSE), have been installed and inventoried by life sup-
         port personnel. Aircrews are not required to physically inventory those items. However, boom

     operators accomplishing the aircraft preflight/thru-flight will perform a cursory inspection to
     ensure sufficient quantities are available for the mission. The AC or designated aircrew represen-
     tative (boom operator normally) will inventory and assume responsibility (by signing and dating
     the AFTO Form 46) for LSE while in command of the aircraft and throughout the entire mission.
     Conduct inventory prior to departing home-station and following en route crew changes by
     reviewing, signing, and dating the AFTO Form 46 IAW AFI 11-2MDS-series, Volume 3. Perform
     preflight inspections of aircraft-installed LSE IAW appropriate Air Force TOs, aircraft manuals,
     higher headquarters publications, and local policies. This acknowledges that the cursory inspec-
     tion has been accomplished.
        9.12.10.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Life support items coming due while an aircraft is on alert
        status or away from home are placed on a Red Dash until the aircraft goes off alert or returns
        to home station before upgrading to a Red X, IAW T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Main-
        tenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures.
     9.12.10.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Maintenance Equipment Documentation. All items on the AMC
     Form 222, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, have been physically inventoried by mainte-
     nance. Aircrews are not required to physically inventory those items. However, when accomplish-
     ing the aircraft preflight/thru-flight, a cursory inspection is required to ensure sufficient quantities
     are available for the mission.
     9.12.10.3. (Added-TRAVIS) AMC Form 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occur-
     rence Worksheet, Procedures. AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 3, paragraph 8.4., provides specific cri-
     teria on when to complete an AMC Form 97. The form is a tool used to collect information solely
     for the purpose of mishap prevention. Information provided is not protected under the promise of
     confidentiality. Contact 60 AMW/SE or 349 AMW/SE regarding questions concerning military
     safety privilege. IAW these regulations, report mishaps as soon as possible, before the end of the
     current Crew Duty Time (CDT) using guidance in AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 3, paragraph 8.4.
        9.12.10.3.1. (Added-TRAVIS) 60 AMW and 349 AMW crews will adhere to the following
        guidelines:
            9.12.10.3.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Immediately notify the nearest C2 facility and your
            squadron commander or operations officer.
            9.12.10.3.1.2. (Added-TRAVIS) If there is any damage or injury, immediately notify the
            nearest Flight Safety Officer (FSO). At Travis AFB, on-call FSOs are available through 60
            AMW/CP or 349 AMW/WOC.
            9.12.10.3.1.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Fax or email the completed AMC Form 97 to 60 AMW/
            SE (837-1104 or 60amw.FlightSafety@amc.af.mil) and 60 AMW/CP (837-5950) before
            the end of the current Crew Duty Time (CDT). An electronic version of the AMC Form 97
            is available on the 60 AMW/SE website at https://w3.travis.af.mil/safety/.
            9.12.10.3.1.4. (Added-TRAVIS) 349 AMW crews will fax or email a copy to 349 AMW/
            WOC (837-0824/1945 or 349AMW.CP@amc.af.mil).
        9.12.10.3.2. (Added-TRAVIS) If unable to fax or email from the location of the incident,
        promptly transmit it at the first opportunity. L Band email is an effective option.

         9.12.10.3.3. (Added-TRAVIS) If a Travis crew is flying another wing’s aircraft and an AMC
         Form 97 is required, use the notification guidelines in paragraph 9.12.10.3.1. (Added) and fax
         a copy of the form to the safety office of the wing owning the aircraft.
         9.12.10.3.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Compliance with the above procedures provides timely mis-
         hap reporting to commanders, enables the command posts and safety offices to accomplish
         necessary reporting, and initiates safety channel investigation to prevent similar mishaps. If
         there is any damage or injury, the crew should not be released prior to contacting an FSO.
      9.12.10.4. (Added-TRAVIS) AFTO Form 781, Clearing Red X Symbols. 60 LG authorizes the
      flight engineer to clear Red X symbols on their airplane at en route stations when qualified main-
      tenance personnel are not available to satisfy these requirements. This authority is limited to those
      items listed in the exception note of AFI 11-2KC-10V3. Clearance of any other Red X entry will
      require approval from the 60 LG/CC or designated alternate. The technician/crew chief accom-
      plishing the work should sign the "Corrected By" block and the flight engineer should sign off the
      "Inspected By" block and initial the symbol. Use call back procedures through Travis Command
      Post. Reference T.O. 00-20-1 and AMC1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance General Policies
      and Procedures, for further guidance.
      9.12.10.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Mission Numbers and Symbols.
         9.12.10.5.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Mission numbers are listed for each leg on the AMC Form
         59, AMC Mission Tracking. The related mission symbol is derived from this number. Cur-
         rent Operations will strive to provide crews with correct mission numbers and symbols prior to
         their departure from Travis.
         9.12.10.5.2. (Added-TRAVIS) The Wing Operations Plan (WOP) monthly supplement con-
         tains a matrix to determine the mission symbol using the mission number. If launched from
         alert status, recut while off station, or not given a mission symbol, use this matrix to derive the
         correct mission symbol. There must be a valid 12-digit mission number to determine your
         3-digit mission symbol. Query command and control for this 12-digit mission number when
         recut. If unable to compute a mission symbol, contact Current Operations.
         9.12.10.5.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Mission symbol information changes frequently; the matrix
         in the current month’s WOP must be used to derive the proper mission symbol. All squadron
         mission kits should include the monthly WOP.
         9.12.10.5.4. (Added-TRAVIS) The mission number and mission symbol on the flight autho-
         rization is normally for the first leg only. A common mistake is to use the same mission infor-
         mation for positioning, execution and depositioning legs.
      9.12.10.6. (Added-TRAVIS) AFTO Form 781, Debrief Process.
         9.12.10.6.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrews will report to Maintenance Debrief. Debrief will
         attempt to input all required data from the AFTO Form(s) 781 into G081 while the crew is
         debriefing the sortie. After AFTO Form 781 data is input into G081, Debrief will apply the
         proper MMICS number and initials on the original AFTO Form(s) 781 and return the AFTO
         Form(s) 781 to the crew. The crew will hand carry the AFTO Form(s) 781 to their squadron
         for disposition. NOTE: Anytime a crew “deadheads” home with AFTO Form(s) 781 the crew
         must take all original AFTO(s) 781 to Maintenance Debrief.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                115


          9.12.10.6.2. (Added-TRAVIS) If Maintenance Debrief is unable to enter the AFTO Form(s)
          781 data into G081 while the aircrew is debriefing maintenance, Debrief will make unofficial
          copies of the affected form(s) for the aircrew. Copies will be stamped in red ink “Unofficial
          copy-not for flight records use.” Debrief will also annotate on the unofficial copy(s) the reason
          the data could not be entered into G081. If AFTO Form 781 data cannot be entered into G081
          due to mission symbol/number conflict, the aircrew should attempt to correct the error. If the
          aircrew cannot resolve the conflict, Debrief and 60 OSS Current Operations will resolve the
          conflict during normal duty hours. Aircrew delays at Maintenance Debrief to process G081
          should be kept to a minimum.
   9.12.11. (Added-TRAVIS) Air Refueling.
      9.12.11.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Air refueling will not be conducted during departure climb out or
      descent for approach except in emergency situations. Air refueling may be accomplished during
      intermediate climbs/descents provided the activity is briefed.
      9.12.11.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Receiver and tanker timing criteria for a point parallel or en route
      rendezvous are contained in FAA 7610.4J, Ch 10, Aerial Refueling. Any timing outside the appro-
      priate windows must be coordinated with receiver unit and track schedulers. ARTCC is not the
      approval authority for entry/exit time changes. They can only deconflict traffic where you delay,
      not the track itself.
          9.12.11.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrews should not change an en route rendezvous into a
          point parallel (or vice versa) resulting in changes to their scheduled entry/exit times or ARCT
          over the ARCP without prior coordination through scheduling. Track schedulers may schedule
          other aircraft on the track at the same altitude with minimum spacing.
          9.12.11.2.2. (Added-TRAVIS) To avoid air refueling communications from interrupting
          other aircraft rendezvous, crews will use the communications plan for the active air refueling
          track (for example, on AR-7BA, switch to the communications plan for AR-7A at the turn).
          When an interplane frequency is used as the air refueling frequency on an AR track or anchor,
          monitor the frequency on the communications plan for the associated track or anchor.
      9.12.11.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Aerial Refueling of Foreign Aircraft under Foreign Military Sales.
      Crews will annotate the AF Form 3578, Tanker Activity Report, with the proper six-letter
      alpha-numeric Foreign Military Sales case number. The case number will be annotated in the
      "Receiver Unit" block of the form. If the Foreign Military Sales missions are attached to a COR-
      ONET movement, annotate the CORONET identifier on the AF Form 3578 in the remarks section
      (i.e., CE-100). This information is also required on the AF Form 791.

Table 9.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Foreign Military Sales Case Numbers.

      9.12.11.4. (Added-TRAVIS) B-1B Conflict in Air-Refueling Procedures. The B-1B's current
      rendezvous visibility requirements allow them to close to 1/2 mile and 500 feet below rendezvous
116                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


         altitude without having visual contact with the tanker. Their manual says, "Rendezvous closure
         will not be continued inside 1/2 NM range (2 NM for multiple receiver formations) unless visual
         contact is established with the tanker(s)". This is in direct conflict with the T.O. 1-1C-1-33 which
         requires rendezvous closure to be discontinued at 1 NM and 1000 feet below tanker rendezvous
         altitude until visual contact is established with the tanker. Until the B-1B's Tech Order is revised,
         comply with T.O. 1-1C-1-33 procedures. When scheduled for a B-1B refueling pre-coordinate
         these procedures in the event the rendezvous is conducted in IMC conditions (make sure they are
         aware of the 1 NM and 1000 feet below restriction).
      9.12.12. (Added-TRAVIS) Functional Check Flights.
         9.12.12.1. (Added-TRAVIS) 60 OG/OGV is the OPR for all Functional Check Flights (FCF).
         FCFs will be flown by FCF-trained crewmembers certified by the 60 OG/CC. AR634, located
         within W283 and W285, is the Travis AFB designated FCF airspace.
      9.12.13. (Added-TRAVIS) Boom Operator Procedures.
         9.12.13.1. (Added-TRAVIS) General Procedures. If cargo is transported, identify a second fully
         qualified boom operator as the cargo boom. The cargo boom will accomplish the cargo checklist,
         pre-mission coordination with the appropriate agencies, and assure the passenger information
         required for the DD Form 365-4 is provided to the primary boom. The cargo boom will be the pri-
         mary crewmember responsible for passengers and accomplish all required customs and agricul-
         ture procedures. The cargo boom will also brief the aircraft commander on any hazardous or
         special cargo on the aircraft IAW AFJMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military
         Air Shipments.
            9.12.13.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) For load briefing information at Travis AFB refer to the
            Wing Operations Plan Sequence of Events (SOE) O, Y, or Z.
         9.12.13.2. (Added-TRAVIS) KC-10 Non Standard Configuration.
            9.12.13.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) A nonstandard configuration only exists after addition of air-
            craft equipment not referenced on the DD Form 365-1 “Chart A” Basic Weight Checklist
            Record and AFI 11-2KC-10 Vol. 3, Chapter 25. The addition of equipment that is not listed in
            DD Form 365-1 “Chart A” that has not been tested or certified for use in the KC-10 also con-
            stitutes a non-standard configuration. Example: strapping computer equipment to a DV table
            for use in-flight, placing equipment in emergency aisle space, and using equipment for other
            than its intended use. This requires a waiver from HQ AMC.
            9.12.13.2.2. (Added-TRAVIS) When a DV mission is scheduled, the configuration will be
            cited in the mission directive published by special airlift. The crew chief will assure that all
            configuration changes are completed, initial the checklist and post it in the binder behind the
            latest Chart "C." The boom operator will amend the last chart "C" entry with the weight and
            moment change and enter this as the basic weight and moment on reference line 1 of the DD
            Form 365-4.
            9.12.13.2.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Removal/Addition of Aircraft Equipment. Missing/removed
            items, which are considered part of the normal aircraft configuration, such as the Z-LAV,
            pieces of the walkway, or sets of seats, do not constitute a non-standard configuration. If these
            items are onboard but strapped to a pallet or are completely removed from the aircraft, it is a
            matter of making an adjustment to the aircraft weight and balance computation (Refer to
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                117


        “Chart A” for weights/moments of these items). When carrying more than the normal (4) IAU
        pallets, treat any additional IAU pallet as cargo. This also does not constitute a non-standard
        configuration and may be carried as such. When the additional pallets are onboard and there is
        other cargo manifested as hazardous, you must check its compatibility with regard to the oxy-
        gen generating units on the IAU. Additional IAU pallets are still considered aircraft equipment
        and do not need to be manifested as cargo, nor do they require shipper’s declarations for dan-
        gerous goods.
           9.12.13.2.3.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Configuration waivers are needed any time you place
           equipment in aisle spaces, equipment that hinders access to emergency equipment/oxygen,
           aircraft seats installed facing aft, cargo barrier nets/environmental curtain not installed in
           correct position, and the cargo handling system used not as designed (i.e., moving rails,
           lock pawls, etc.). This list is not comprehensive. Anytime a piece of equipment is installed
           in a place it was not designed for, or if it will hinder evacuation of the aircraft, a waiver is
           required. The addition of equipment that is not listed in DD Form 365-1, Basic Weight
           Checklist Record, Chart A, that has not been tested or certified for use in the KC-10 also
           constitutes a nonstandard configuration.
     9.12.13.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Wide Body Aircraft Main Deck Loaders.
        9.12.13.3.1. (Added-TRAVIS) TA-40 Tunner Loader. This loader has an adapter that is used
        for loading the lower lobe of a B-747. It protrudes out from the front edge of the loader but
        does not run the entire length of the loader platform. When positioned against the door of the
        KC-10 there is a gap on the loader operator’s side of the loader approximately 40 inches long
        and 20 inches deep from the doorsill to the loader. This may present a safety hazard. If it does,
        the boom operator is authorized to request that the TA-40 operator remove the extension, thus
        eliminating the gap.
        9.12.13.3.2. (Added-TRAVIS) 9-Ton High-Lift Truck. Use of this vehicle for loading the
        KC-10 presents some special challenges. Currently there is very little information available on
        usage of this truck as a loader, use extreme caution. (Reference the Boom Operator In-flight
        Guide for further guidance).
        9.12.13.3.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Procedures for Transporting Cargo on 25K, 40K, and 60K
        Loaders. These procedures are to enhance the fall protection at the rear of the 25K, 40K, and
        60K loaders. Individuals will not proceed past the last pallet lock on the 25K and the 60K
        loader, and individuals will not proceed past the second to the last pallet lock on the 40K
        loader. If conditions necessitate personnel to proceed past the last pallet lock on the 25K, 60K
        loader and the second to the last lock on the 40K loader, the deck must be lowered to its lowest
        position or fall protection (a safety harness attached to a tie down point on the loader deck)
        must be used. After the first two pallets on the 25K, four pallets on the 40K, and five pallets on
        the 60K loader have been loaded onto the aircraft, a load team member will disengage the pal-
        let locks and remove the supplemental restraint from the last pallet. The load team members
        will then pull the pallet up to the next pallet position on the 25K and the 40K loader before
        pushing it onto the aircraft. On the 60K loader, the operator will use the power conveyers to
        load the pallets onto the aircraft.
     9.12.13.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Pallet Position 13L. The DD Form 365-3 Chart C’s for 60 AMW
     KC-10s have been amended to remove items incorrectly listed at station 1883. The following

      9.12.13.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Cargo Boom Supervisor/Enhanced Boom Operators. The follow-
      ing procedures are designed to assist in load planning, marshalling, and cargo loading during con-
      tingencies.
          9.12.13.5.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Cargo Boom Supervisor. The 60 OGV Boom Operator, or
          designated representative, will perform cargo boom supervisor duties. Duties will include
          reviewing the load plan and visually checking the chocks prior to the Enhanced Boom Opera-
          tor’s arrival. The Cargo Boom Supervisor will provide assistance during the loading operation.
          9.12.13.5.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Enhanced Boom Operators. Current operations will task the
          squadrons with the requirement for Enhanced Boom Operators with a MIS during contingen-
          cies, ORIs and CREs. Enhanced boom operators will follow the WOP SOE Y procedures to
          include the load briefing at Base Operations and then proceed to the aircraft and accomplish all
          TO 1C-10(K) A-9 cargo loading procedures/requirements. After the load is completed, all
          paper work and computations will be left on the flight engineer’s table.
          9.12.13.5.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Notification Procedures. Travis ATOC will determine load
          time and notify Travis Command Post. The command post will alert the squadron mission
          controller who in turn will alert the Enhanced Boom Operators. Enhanced Boom Operators
          will be alerted in time to allow them to be in place at the aircraft at the scheduled load start
          time.
          9.12.13.5.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Crew Rest Requirements. Crewmembers meeting the crew
          rest criteria defined in AFI 11-202, Vol. 3 may perform aircraft generation activities (preflight,
          load, start, and taxi as described in AFI 11-202 Vol.3) without having formally been placed in
          crew rest. Activities involving aircraft generation shall not exceed a 12-hour duty day. Crew
          duty day begins at the start of official duties unless noted as follows. For crewmembers who
          have less than 12 hours crew rest but greater than eight (8) hours, OG/CC or equivalent is the
          waiver authority. This authority should be used judiciously and individual crewmembers must
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                  119


        evaluate their ability to mentally and physically perform required crew duties. Under normal
        day-to-day operations, the OG/CC should ensure crewmembers are afforded 12 hours rest for
        aircraft generation activities, but in some extreme cases, it may be necessary to begin these
        duties with less than 12 hours rest. Waiver for rest periods of less than eight (8) hours still rests
        with the MAJCOM/DO or ANG/DO as appropriate. Crew duty day for aircraft generation
        activities begun with less than 12 hours rest is limited to 10 hours. This 10-hour period begins
        at crew show time.
     9.12.13.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Hazardous Materials.
        9.12.13.6.1. (Added-TRAVIS) The only document that will be used to certify hazardous
        materials is the Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods. The DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift
        Inspection Record, will not be used as a hazardous materials certification document for vehi-
        cles and wheeled support equipment during mobility/contingency operations.
        9.12.13.6.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Lithium Batteries. The recommended fire agents listed in
        AFJMAN 24-204, are water, CO2 or a class D fire extinguisher. These agents will only help
        reduce the intensity of the fire until the lithium expends itself. Shipping agencies have advised
        crews to use aircraft potable water systems as fire suppressants. The use of any water is not
        recommended on KC-10s because water presents a hazard to electronic equipment located in
        the center accessory compartment and the ARO compartment. AFJMAN 24-204, paragraph
        1.10, Protective Equipment, states that the shipper must provide any special equipment
        required. If they do not, the boom operator can refuse to carry the dangerous goods.
        9.12.13.6.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Hazardous Materials in ISU-90 Containers. Recent
        real-world events saw an increase in the use of the ISU-90 container. In some cases, ISU con-
        tainers were found “Stuffed” with hazardous materials without regard to in-flight accessibility.
        Unless load planned to allow ready in-flight access in event of an emergency, hazardous mate-
        rials will be removed from the container. AFJMAN 24-204 clearly identifies this requirement
        and the few hazardous materials exempted from being accessible. Some containers have
        built-in “HAZMAT” access panels. However, when these containers are utilized, any hazard-
        ous materials (except those identified in AFJMAN 24-204) must be positioned to permit
        access through the panel. Hazardous materials in the high side of the container are inaccessible
        unless the adjacent pallet position is left empty to facilitate opening the doors. If the person
        responsible for the container is not on board, the key or combination for locks on containers
        must be on the container adjacent to the lock. AMC inspectors and aircrew are authorized
        access on all cargo containers placed on AMC aircraft except when waived by HQ AMC/DO
        for security reasons.
        9.12.13.6.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Plastic Jerry Cans. POP approved plastic Jerry Can filler
        spouts have leaked during steep aircraft climbs. Investigations revealed that while the con-
        tainer caps felt snug, they could be tightened further. In addition the Jerry Cans were com-
        pletely full. Aircraft are subject to extreme ascents/descents, particularly during tactical
        operations. While the shipper is ultimately responsible for proper preparation of cargo, AMC
        “INSPECTORS” should periodically spot check Jerry Can caps. Recommend caps be tight-
        ened/checked to reduce possibility of leaks.
        9.12.13.6.5. (Added-TRAVIS) The KC-10 aircraft will not be used for transportation of haz-
        ardous waste.
120                                               AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


      9.12.13.7. (Added-TRAVIS) Customs procedures. When required, make sure all aircraft doors
      remain closed until a customs agent requests them to be opened. When delays are encountered,
      maintenance personnel may deplane to accomplish required after-landing maintenance actions.
      When returning to the United States, the aircraft commander or designated representative will
      make sure the crew completes their individual customs declaration prior to the outbound customs
      inspection.
         9.12.13.7.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Permits to Proceed. If there is only one copy of the thru-load
         manifest, it should remain with the Permit to Proceed package. If Aerial Port personnel insist
         on taking the thru-load manifest, include a statement along with the individual’s name and
         rank with the Permit to Proceed package.
      9.12.13.8. (Added-TRAVIS) Passenger movement. With aircraft commander approval, passen-
      gers may observe air refueling when they are escorted by a crewmember to and from the ARO sta-
      tion. Primary crewmembers will be notified when passengers are in transit between the passenger
      compartment and the ARO station. Brief passengers on the use of the quick-donning oxygen sys-
      tem. The total number of individuals in the ARO compartment at any one time will not exceed the
      number of seats with seat belts and operable oxygen regulators.
      9.12.13.9. (Added-TRAVIS) KC-10 Documentation Procedures.
         9.12.13.9.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Contingency Mission Cargo Manifests. For mobility move-
         ments, the following guidance exists for cargo and hazardous materials preparation and docu-
         mentation: AFJI 24-108, Movements of Units in USAF Aircraft, and AFJMAN 24-204,
         Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment. A cargo manifest is required and
         can be a computer-generated form or a manual manifest. Normally the Computer Assisted
         Load Management (CALM) printout is available from the Tanker/Airlift Control Element or
         Mission Support Team at the deployment site. If it is not available, a DD Form 2130-6 or DD
         Form 2130 -7 will be used for the appropriate aircraft configuration. Instructions for the airlift
         user to complete the manifest are in AFJI 24-108, Attachment B. For any Section 3 move, the
         CALM plan, AMC Load Sequence Planning Worksheet, or DD Forms 2130-6 or –7 are
         acceptable manifests. Do not accept a DD Form 2133 (JI Form) as a manifest! This only certi-
         fies that the cargo was inspected.
         9.12.13.9.2. (Added-TRAVIS) CALM Load Plans/AMC Load Sequence Planning Sheet.
         The use of the load planning sequence sheet instead of the CALM load plan is becoming more
         wide-spread and is an authorized load planning worksheet. The CALM load plan will mostly
         be used for Tactical/Contingency/Mobility operations. For channel cargo, a manifest is still
         required.
         9.12.13.9.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Shippers Declaration Form. AFMC message
         131320Z-changed paragraph A17.3 of AFJMAN 24-204 to read: “complete and sign at least
         two (2) copies of the Shippers Declaration Form”. This change only applies to Chapter 3
         moves. All other operations still require compliance with paragraph A17.2.2 requiring three
         (3) original copies.
         9.12.13.9.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Certification, Marking and Labeling Deficiencies. The item
         below is not incorporated into AFJMAN 24-204, dated 1 March 1997.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                121


        9.12.13.9.5. (Added-TRAVIS) The DD Form 1387-2, Cargo Manifest, will be utilized for
        identifying special handling instructions of classified, sensitive, and non-hazardous items, and
        if required, signature service protected items.
        9.12.13.9.6. (Added-TRAVIS) When a DD Form 2130, Series Load Plan, or similar auto-
        mated product is used to manifest cargo, the controlled items of the shipment will be specifi-
        cally identified on the associated load list or on the load plan. Do not transport controlled items
        using only the transportation control number (TCN) assigned to the entire pallet, since visibil-
        ity of the specific item may not be possible.
        9.12.13.9.7. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrew members may still encounter the DD Form 1907,
        Signature and Tally Record, when transiting non-AMC bases. At these locations, it may be
        used instead of the cargo manifest to transfer shipments.
        9.12.13.9.8. (Added-TRAVIS) AF Form 4069, Tie Down Equipment Checklist. IAW
        AMCI 24-101, Vol 11, Ramp Services will initiate an AF Form 4069 for each home-station
        aircraft departing Travis AFB. An AF Form 4069 will be accomplished on all other missions.
           9.12.13.9.8.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Boom operators will make a concerted effort to
           exchange tie down equipment on a one-for-one basis. If this is not possible, annotate the
           AF Form 4069.
           9.12.13.9.8.2. (Added-TRAVIS) APS will inventory aircraft tie down out of home sta-
           tion. Each en route station will inventory aircraft and annotate the AF Form 4069, Section
           IA and Section III with the item/amount of increase or decrease, station, date, and reason
           for changes.
           9.12.13.9.8.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircraft arriving will ensure the AF Form 4069 is com-
           pleted (signed) IAW locally established procedures. The ramp crew will conduct an inven-
           tory on all inbound aircraft and document the AF Form 4069 and return it to the ramp
           service office.
           9.12.13.9.8.4. (Added-TRAVIS) KC-10 aircraft will have an AF Form 4069 in a red
           folder located in the KC-10 crew chief box for all missions other than locals. On local mis-
           sions the boom operator will inventory the tie downs and make adjustments to the Weight
           and Balance Form F reflecting the correct number of tie downs on board. IAW AFI
           11-2KC-10V3 KC-10, Operations Procedures, the KC-10 will have the minimum daily
           requirements of tie downs for local missions. This includes 30 chains, 30 devices, and 30
           cargo straps. If unable to correct this prior to takeoff, annotate this in the aircraft forms and
           notify 60 OG/OGV after landing. Contact 60 OG/OGV on-call boom operator if you have
           any questions or note any deviations from the above procedures.
     9.12.13.10. (Added-TRAVIS) KC-10 Equipment and Procedures Interpretations.
        9.12.13.10.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Cargo Barrier Net. Crews departing home station will
        ensure they have a fully operational cargo barrier net regardless of cargo status. HQ AMC will
        no longer issue waivers to allow use of the net when components are missing.
        9.12.13.10.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Restraint of Cross Track Assemblies #2L and R Doors. Use
        a minimum of four P/N AZZ7410-1 Equipment Restraint Assemblies to secure cross track
        assemblies at the #2L/R doorways (when using the IAU). Since cross tracks are being used for
        guide rail purposes and not flight restraint limits, four symmetrically positioned restraint
122                                            AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


      assemblies meet the required ground restraint criteria. Any time the cross tracks are used for
      flight, each will have eight restraint assemblies.
      9.12.13.10.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Use Door Sill Conveyor. The doorsill conveyor is required
      to be installed for IAU installation/removal IAW T.O. 1C-10(K) A-2-25, Organizational
      Maintenance—Equipment Furnishing (DOUGLAS), maintained on each aircraft. Dash 21 per-
      sonnel loading/unloading the IAU are required to install it. Doorsill conveyors that are missing
      excessive numbers of bumpers on the back can cause damage to the door seal and aircraft skin,
      especially if they are all missing from the same area. Advise maintenance of the missing
      bumpers so they can be replaced or another conveyor assembly obtained.
      9.12.13.10.4. (Added-TRAVIS) ESK Bins. DOD 4500.9R, Defense Transportation Regula-
      tion, Part III, Mobility, 11 Apr 97 provides guidance on containers. The only container certi-
      fied to meet T.O. 1C-10(K) A-9, Cargo Loading Manual restraint criteria is the ISU 90 series.
      These containers have an integral design that will secure up to 10,000 pounds of cargo to a 1.5
      G forward, aft, left, or right load and a 2G vertical load. All other containers must be service-
      able and be properly palletized. In the case of the ESK Bins (white Fiberglass container with
      red vinyl doors), there are several problems. The doors were only designed as dust and mois-
      ture barriers. There is no tech data certifying the maximum weight or restraint capability of the
      doors. In addition, there is no means for securing the cargo inside these containers. The
      method of securing these containers to a pallet with two straps does not meet the basic restraint
      criteria in the T.O. 1C-10(K) A-9. This only provides vertical restraint. Should the aircraft
      experience a 1.5-G load factor the containers and contents will be allowed to shift. The best
      means to secure the containers is the use of two HCU-7/E side nets and the HCU-15/C top net.
      9.12.13.10.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Weissenfel MB-1 Chain Compatibility. Compatibility prob-
      lems have been identified with the Weissenfel MB-1 chain and chains manufactured by other
      contractors. The Weissenfel chain is identified by the word W- ITALY stamped on the chain
      hook. Problems noted have included; Weissenfel chain hooks not connecting to other manu-
      facturers’ chains when constructing chain assemblies and chain bridles, and individual chain
      links on the same chain not locking in the MB-1 chain pocket when tested with a sampling of
      different tie down devices. The chain and device may appear to be secure, however, even hand
      force on the chain and device may allow the chain to unlock and slide out of the chain pocket.
      If this happens, insert a different link of the chain into the device and check to see that the
      chain is locked properly. Until final resolution has been determined with the item manager, do
      not intermix Weissenfel chains on the same chain assembly or chain bridle with chains from a
      different manufacturer. As always, ensure all tie down chains and devices are closely
      inspected to ensure the chains are fully seated and locked in the tie down device chain pocket.
      9.12.13.10.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircraft Equipment Stowage Container. AFI 11-2KC-10V3,
      Chapter 25, Table 25.1 lists KC-10 aircraft equipment that is required to be onboard. There are
      provisions for stowing these items in the aircraft equipment stowage container at station 1970.
      They are accounted for by line entries 222.2, 227 and 228 in the DD Form 365-3 Chart C. If
      items (vacuum cleaner, hazardous materials protective equipment kit and toolbox) are not in or
      cannot be placed in the container there is unauthorized equipment onboard the aircraft, which
      has not been accounted for in the DD Form 365-3 Chart C. If this is the case the following
      781entry is required. “Excess equipment is stowed in aircraft equipment stowage container
      which invalidates aircraft weight and balance computations.”
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                               123


        9.12.13.10.7. (Added-TRAVIS) Use of Insecticide Aboard AMC Aircraft. For revised infor-
        mation refer to 11-2KC-10 Vol 3 and Aircrew Border Clearance Guide dated 1 Apr 98. Addi-
        tional information can be found in AFI 48-104, Medical and Agricultural Foreign/Domestic
        Quarantine. Do Not Spray with passengers onboard unless mandated by the Foreign Clear-
        ance Guide.
        9.12.13.10.8. (Added-TRAVIS) Center Guide Rail in Pallet Position 4 when IAU is
        Installed. The center guide rail should be installed during loading to guide pallets into roller
        channels. The center guide rail will be removed for flight any time the IAU is installed. The
        rail may be stored on a pallet or placed in conveyor assembly slots near pallet position 9L.
        Ensure the rail locks are on the onboard left side of the aircraft to prevent jamming of the rail.
     9.12.13.11. (Added-TRAVIS) KC-10 Joint Task Force Command Module (JTF/CCM).
        9.12.13.11.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Configuration Change/Cargo Handling Components. T.O.
        1-1C-10(K)A-2-25TP-7, Configuration Change and Cargo Handling Components, directs
        removal of existing cargo handling components and installation of new cargo handling com-
        ponents. The configuration change will be made on the DD Form 365-4 Form F by using the
        information provided in the configuration change checklist. This checklist will be found in the
        aircraft weight and balance binder opposite the latest Chart C. The following loading guidance
        applies:
           9.12.13.11.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) The cargo door must be open to the full open position
           for loading of the JTF/CCM module.
           9.12.13.11.1.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Seven pallets will be loaded in 13L, 12 L&R, 11 L&R
           and 10 L&R. Some will be for pre-palletized equipment some will be for the sub-floor. All
           rings must be in the up position for the pallets that do not have pre-palletized equipment.
           To the maximum extent possible, use pallets to secure equipment and baggage. If suffi-
           cient pallet space is not available, floor loading is permitted IAW, -9 procedures on page
           5A-1.
           9.12.13.11.1.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Ensure the repositioned center guide rails and
           twenty-four cross track assemblies secure the module. This side and vertical restraint
           equipment must be centered on each unit of the module. The module has hard rubber
           bumpers, which snug it against the fore and aft locks and prevent it from shifting. There
           are no lips on the fore and aft edge of the module and the fore and aft locks are for longitu-
           dinal restraint only. The restraint requirement for all equipment and cargo on the six-pallet
           sub-floor is 9 Gs in the forward direction because passengers are in the cargo compart-
           ment.
           9.12.13.11.1.4. (Added-TRAVIS) The weight of each section of the module is marked on
           data plates located on the left side at the center of balance of each unit. This data will be
           used to complete the DD Form 365-4.
           9.12.13.11.1.5. (Added-TRAVIS) There are several models of galley pallets. The weight
           of the galley pallet will be provided for inclusion in the DD Form 365-4. At present there
           are no waivers for alternative methods of restraint. Until there is a waiver provided from
           AMC for methods not listed in the T.O. 1C-10(K) A-9, use only authorized devices to pro-
           vide the required restraint cited in the T.O. 1C-10(K) A-9, Section 5D.
124                                                AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


             9.12.13.11.1.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Oxygen Requirement/Placement. If you fly with the
             JTF/CCM, it will have approximately 20 Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS).
             These are provided by life support and will include two (2) P5 masks and an EPOS demo
             kit. Normal placement of the bottles/EPOS is as follows:
                 9.12.13.11.1.6.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Ten are pre-positioned in the Command Module
                 to be used during depressurization emergencies.
                 9.12.13.11.1.6.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Two are for stewards performing duties in areas
                 where oxygen capability does not exist.
                 9.12.13.11.1.6.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Eight will be preposition on the rope in the cargo
                 compartment.
             9.12.13.11.1.7. (Added-TRAVIS) Flight Attendant Brief. Stewards that fly with us on
             DV missions are assigned to various stations: Andrews AFB, McDill AFB, and Yokota
             AB. The flight attendants from Yokota have current AF Form 8s and are qualified in the
             KC-10. These KC-10-qualified attendants can carry out their duties unsupervised. This
             includes passenger briefings and manning doors 2 L/R for takeoff and landing. Treat them
             as part of the team and take into account their needs for smooth mission completion.
             9.12.13.11.1.8. (Added-TRAVIS) Emergency Shutdown. When considering the emer-
             gency shut down procedures there could be two possible situations. In the first case, you
             could have only the JTF/CCM where power distribution is from the floor outlet directly to
             the JTF/CCM. In the second case, you might have both the JTF/CCM and the COMM
             Module where power distribution is from the floor outlet, through the COMM Module and
             subsequently to the JTF/CCM.
                 9.12.13.11.1.8.1. (Added-TRAVIS) In the case of a JTF/CCM only, EMERGENCY
                 SHUT DOWN PROCEDURES involves two steps. There is a RED emergency button,
                 located inside the JTF/CCM to the right of the entry door. Pushing this button will dis-
                 connect power to the JTF/CCM. Power from the floor to the JTF/CCM can be removed
                 by opening the CARGO COMPT AUX PWR circuit breaker on the flight engineers
                 upper main circuit breaker panel.
                 9.12.13.11.1.8.2. (Added-TRAVIS) When carrying both the JTF/CCM and the
                 COMM Module, an emergency shutdown procedure involves three steps. The RED
                 emergency button located inside the JTF/CCM disconnects power to the JTF/CCM.
                 Disconnecting power to the COMM Module involves depressing the RED button on
                 the circuit breaker panel which is located to the left of the enter door. Power from the
                 floor to the JTF/CCM can be removed by opening the CARGO COMPT AUX PWR
                 circuit breaker on the flight engineers upper main circuit breaker panel.
      9.12.13.12. (Added-TRAVIS) Movement of Large-Bodied Passengers. When carrying passen-
      gers who do not fit in a single aircraft seat using a single seatbelt, seatbelt extensions are not
      approved. The use of cargo straps and alterations of the seat configuration (i.e., raising/removing
      the arm rests, removing the seat cushion, etc.) are also not authorized. There will be times when
      large-bodied passengers cannot be accepted for flight aboard AMC aircraft, due to flight safety
      considerations. It is the passenger terminal’s responsibility to ensure these passengers are not
      manifested on aircraft where they will not fit. If someone in this category makes it to the aircraft,
      use the utmost tact and diplomacy as this is a very sensitive issue.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                125


  9.12.14. (Added-TRAVIS) Travis Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Plan.
     9.12.14.1. (Added-TRAVIS) When Phase II is in effect, Current Operations will make every
     effort not to schedule departures or recoveries for missions during the designated BASH window.
        9.12.14.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Total number of missions scheduled that fall within an iden-
        tified BASH window will be annotated and approved (for scheduling purposes) in the monthly
        Wing Operations Plan. Additionally, missions will be reviewed and approved at the Air Oper-
        ations Directive meeting.
        9.12.14.1.2. (Added-TRAVIS) If mission requirements dictate a departure during this period,
        Current Operations will task Airfield Management to visually inspect the departure runway for
        birds 20 minutes prior to the scheduled takeoff time (see 60 AMW OPLAN 91-212, BASH
        Plan, for more details). All takeoffs during this period require 60 OG/CC approval.
        9.12.14.1.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Prior to transitioning at NON-DOD airfields, planner/air-
        crews will obtain any available bird activity information. Aircrews experiencing high bird
        activity at these locations will advise their respective safety office BASH representative.
        9.12.14.1.4. (Added-TRAVIS) At military or civilian airfields that do not have BASH pro-
        grams, aircrews will use the Bird Hazard Condition (BHC) definitions and the operational
        restrictions as a guide when assessing the risk of bird hazards to flight operations.
     9.12.14.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Bird Hazard Conditions defined.
        9.12.14.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) SEVERE - High wildlife population (as a guide, more than
        15 large birds or 30 small birds) on or immediately above the active runway or other specific
        locations (taxiways, in-field areas, and departure or arrival routes) that represents a high
        potential for a strike. Keep in mind a single bird in a critical location may elevate the BWC to
        SEVERE.
        9.12.14.2.2. (Added-TRAVIS) MODERATE - Increased wildlife population (approximately
        5 to 15 large birds or 15 to 30 small birds) in locations that represent an increased potential for
        a strike.
        9.12.14.2.3. (Added-TRAVIS) LOW - Sparse bird activity within 15 NM of the airport.
     9.12.14.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrew Procedures.
        9.12.14.3.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Anytime the Travis BHC is SEVERE, all flight operations
        (takeoffs, landings and approaches) are prohibited. Airborne aircraft will divert or hold. Devi-
        ations require 60 OG/CC (or higher) approval.
            9.12.14.3.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrews requesting waivers while at NON-AMC loca-
            tions will coordinate with the AMC/DO through the TACC. Recommended guidance dur-
            ing SEVERE BHC is to delay departures and arrivals until bird watch condition is
            MODERATE or less.
            9.12.14.3.1.2. (Added-TRAVIS) In all cases, operational mission priority must be
            weighed in determining waiver approval. When a waiver is approved for operation during
            SEVERE BHC at AMC locations, the local OG/CC (or higher) must actively monitor
            launch and recovery of aircraft.
126                                               AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


            9.12.14.3.1.3. (Added-TRAVIS) When the Travis Bird Hazard Condition is MODER-
            ATE or SEVERE, all aircraft will be issued the appropriate BHC by Base Operations,
            ATC and Travis Command Post. If the condition persists, it may also be broadcast on
            ATIS.
         9.12.14.3.2. (Added-TRAVIS) During the Phase II BASH window or anytime a MODER-
         ATE bird hazard condition has been declared:
            9.12.14.3.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed only when
            departure and arrival routes avoid identified bird activity.
            9.12.14.3.2.2. (Added-TRAVIS) All local IFR/VFR traffic pattern activity will cease
            (airborne aircraft/crews will terminate transition training in the Travis local pattern).
            9.12.14.3.2.3. (Added-TRAVIS) All takeoffs require approval by 60 OG/CC after Air-
            field Management or wildlife control personnel have surveyed the runways/airfield envi-
            ronment for significant bird activity. Aircrews will coordinate approval through 60 AMW/
            CP. ATC and Travis Command Post, in coordination with Airfield Management, will
            advise aircraft of the anticipated delay, if known, for bird dispersal or a return to LOW
            BHC.
            9.12.14.3.2.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Airborne aircraft will divert, hold, or full stop. Aircraft
            commanders should assess the risk by considering fuel status, weather, bird location, etc.,
            when making this decision.
            9.12.14.3.2.5. (Added-TRAVIS) For aircrews on AMC-tasked missions, transition (prac-
            tice patterns, approaches and landings) at NON-DOD airfields will not be accomplished
            during that airfield’s BASH window. In addition, missions should be scheduled to avoid
            other known peak bird activity periods for particular airfields.
      9.12.14.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Bird Avoidance Procedures at Travis AFB.
         9.12.14.4.1. (Added-TRAVIS) In conjunction with the Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
         Program, consider the following to avoid bird strikes in the local pattern. There are many birds
         in the vicinity of the Potrero Hills Landfill which lies beneath the base turn for the circle and
         VFR pattern to RWY 3L (there is a book in Base Ops with pictures of nesting locations). Fol-
         low these guidelines for bird avoidance:
            9.12.14.4.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Runway 03: Plan circling approaches and VFR patterns
            to RWY 3R. Circles and VFR patterns to RWY 3L will avoid over flight of the Potrero
            Hills landfill. If extending beyond the landfill while circling, use Category E minima to
            ensure obstacle clearance.
            9.12.14.4.1.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Runway 21: Do not over fly the Potrero landfill on
            extended upwind VFR patterns or circling to 21L/R from a RWY 3 approach.
      9.12.14.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Air Force Bird Strike Report. Crews will complete an AF Form
      853, Air Force Bird Strike Report, after a bird strike. Use the following procedures:
         9.12.14.5.1. (Added-TRAVIS) When block 8 on the form is answered "yes," an exact loca-
         tion, blocks 9 and 10 (Lat and Long), is required. Consider using the "Mark" key on the FMS
         immediately to capture coordinates. Write the location down when time permits.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                               127


        9.12.14.5.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Details about the exact location of a bird-strike should be
        made in block 26. Complete the date and time (blocks 4 and 5) as well as altitude (block 13).
        9.12.14.5.3. (Added-TRAVIS) If a bird strike was discovered during the flight engineer
        post-mission walk-around, fill in the form as completely as possible.
        9.12.14.5.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Fax completed AF Form 853 worksheets to 60 AMW/SE
        (reference paragraph 9.12.10.3. (Added) for current FAX numbers). If a bird strike results in
        reportable damage or an in-flight emergency, also submit an AF Form 97, IAW paragraph
        9.12.10.3. (Added) Electronic versions of these forms are available on the 60 AMW/SE web-
        site at https://w3.travis.af.mil/safety.
     9.12.14.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrew action after birdstrike: Following a bird strike, aircrews
     should land as soon as conditions permit to have the aircraft inspected by weapon system specific
     qualified maintenance personnel. Bird strike damage cannot be accurately assessed in flight, and
     undetected damage may result in a complex airborne emergency. Only qualified maintenance per-
     sonnel on the ground can make reliable damage assessments. In addition, aircrews should not
     change the aircraft configuration until it has been determined that it is safe to do so. However,
     crewmember judgment should always prevail in any situation in making a decision concerning
     safety of the aircrew and aircraft.
  9.12.15. (Added-TRAVIS) Miscellaneous.
     9.12.15.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Flameless Ration Heater (FRH) for Meals Ready to Eat (MREs):
     MREs with the FRHs incorporated can be identified by the following OSHA markings stenciled
     on each flame retardant fiberboard shipping container: “NOTE: WATER ACTIVATED
     FLAMELESS RATION HEATERS, NSN 8970-010321-9153, SUPPLIED IN EACH MRE
     MEAL BAG.” No special handling, packaging, or certification is required for these FRHs for
     either CONUS or out of CONUS moves. The U.S. Dept of Transportation has determined that
     small quantities of magnesium (8 grams or less per single unit) involved do not warrant regulation
     as a hazardous material. When MREs with FRHs are used as in-flight meals, the aircrew must
     ensure the heaters are not opened or activated on the aircraft. The FRHs will be removed from the
     individual MRE units and retained by each passenger. Bulk packages of these heaters are regu-
     lated as hazardous material and must be properly packaged and documented. The heaters are used
     as supplements for MREs that do not have FRHs incorporated in each MRE meal bag. Domestic
     shipments may be packaged in performance-oriented packaging (POP) approved shipping con-
     tainers or IAW DOT-E 10897 in flame retardant fiberboard boxes. If the DOT exempted container
     is used a copy of the exemption must accompany the shipment. These exempted boxes are marked
     with the exemption number and the following statement: “Water Activated. Note: In case of fire
     involving magnesium, flood with large amounts of water with fog nozzle (not a solid stream)
     DOT-E 10897.”
     9.12.15.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Screening of Armed Crewmembers at AMC Pax Terminals.
     Armed crewmembers should make every effort to avoid carrying concealed weapons into AMC
     passenger terminals. Options include locking weapons in the aircraft gun box or arming crew-
     members after trips to the passenger terminal. If this is impractical or unavoidable, use the follow-
     ing procedures to eliminate the possibility of highlighting armed crewmembers. Armed
     crewmembers must discreetly identify themselves to AMC passenger service personnel upon
     arrival at security checkpoints. One aircrew member presenting a valid set of crew orders, his/her
128                                                  AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


         Military ID Card, and a gun card authorizing the carrying of concealed weapons can accomplish
         this. Once terminal personnel verify this, they will allow the crewmember to vouch for the remain-
         ing crewmembers. The entire crew will then proceed through the magnetometer without removing
         objects from their pockets. This will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers
         are armed. Once again, this is done discreetly so as to not sacrifice their position and in no way
         lessen the security at single points of entry at passenger terminals.

NOTES:
     1. (Added) 60 AMW Y-SID missions originating out of Travis will be scheduled to alert boom
        operators 5+15 hrs prior to takeoff (4+15 for reserve missions). Cargo load time will com-
        mence 3+30 prior to takeoff. These missions will be identified in the weekly AOD meeting
        and annotated in the remarks section of the OSS flying schedule as a Y SOE.
      2. (Added) The load briefing will be conducted at the aircraft for all KC-10 cargo missions orig-
         inating at Travis AFB. When following this SOE, Boom Operators WILL NOT pick up weap-
         ons; weapons should be picked up by crew members alerting at normal alert time. Delays in
         the brief will be noted by the Boom Operator and ATOC Information Controller (time arriv-
         ing at the aircraft will be adjusted).
      3. (Added) Cargo load complete @ 1+30 is for planning purposes; mission requirements will
         dictate actual loading complete timing. PAX baggage loaded after cargo load complete.
      4. (Added) Boom operators will notify Command Post upon arrival at aircraft for commence-
         ment of upload.

  AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR,
            AND HIGH-YIELD EXPLOSIVE THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield
Explosive (CBRNE) weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security threats to the global
operations of air mobility forces. This chapter describes the CBRNE threat, passive defense measures to
mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight operations in a contaminated environment.

10.2. Understanding the CBRNE Threat.
      10.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister, choking,
      and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on your side. The
      ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates of chemicals all
      decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or absorb into surfaces. For decon-
      tamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5 percent bleach solution currently appears to
      be the best and most practical method of removing chemical agents that may remain as a contact haz-
      ard on glass, and unpainted metal. Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is
      soap and water. NOTE: Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed
      chemical warfare agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and vapor haz-
      ards.
      10.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into three areas:
      bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally susceptible to antibiot-
      ics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms or plants; and viruses (i.e.,
      Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive and reproduce. Viruses and toxins
      do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the medical community would be the first to recognize
      that an upsurge in “flu-like symptoms” is actually a bio attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV
      rays, humidity and high/low temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life,
      lasting decades under the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help
      prevent infection.
      10.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called “dirty bomb,” is
      the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive material without
      using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and distance are the best
      defenses against radiation exposure.
      10.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat, radiation,
      and residual fallout. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a nuclear detonation can dam-
      age electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of shielding, distance from the blast,
      and limited time of exposure.
      10.2.5. High-Yield Explosives. High-yield explosives are conventional weapons or devices that are
      capable of a high order of destruction or disruption. Passive defense measures include hardening of
      facilities and establishing stand-off distances for personnel and key assets.

10.3. CBRNE Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities conducted to
negate, contain, and manage the effects of CBRNE attack. Passive defense measures include pre, trans,
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                   135


and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRNE threat through contamination avoidance, protec-
tion, and contamination control.
   10.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive defense
   measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include: in-flight diversion, survival launch, and
   minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, aerospace ground equipment (AGE), and material han-
   dling equipment (MHE).
       10.3.1.1. In-flight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRNE attack or
       has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if at all possible.
       Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the controlling OPORD.
       10.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every reasonable effort
       will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances, aircrew may launch to survive
       if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to the runway. In practice, this option may
       only be practical for aircraft that have just landed or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If
       launch is not possible, shut down engines and avoid running environmental control systems. Close
       aircraft doors and hatches, don Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal protec-
       tive cover on the base. If time does not permit using base facilities, remain in the sealed aircraft for
       a minimum of one-hour after the attack and/or follow host-base guidance.
       10.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly contami-
       nated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance and the use of
       protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly contaminated cargo requires spe-
       cial precautions and must be specifically authorized by the senior transportation commander.
   10.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided, protec-
   tion provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRNE environment. Protection is
   afforded by individual protective equipment, collective protection, and hardening of facilities.
       10.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. The current in-flight protective gear for aircrew mem-
       bers is the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE). The ACDE includes the newer Aircrew
       Eye-Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) above the shoulders and the CWU-66/P or
       CWU-77/P Integrated Aircrew Chemical Coverall (IACC). The Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE)
       consists of the protective mask, C2 series canister (or filter element for MCU-2A/P protective
       mask), and over garment, boots, and gloves. The ACDE and GCE provide protection against
       chemical and biological agents. They do not provide blast or radiation protection from an RDD or
       nuclear detonation. The ACDE requires care during donning using "buddy dressing" procedures
       and Aircrew Life Support (ALS) expertise during processing through the Aircrew Contamination
       Control Area (ACCA). NOTE: AECMs will utilize the MCU-2A series mask.
          10.3.2.1.1. ACDE/GCE Issue. Aircrews will be issued sized ACDE and GCE at home station.
          Aircrews will ensure their ACDE and GCE are available at all times while in a CBRNE threat
          area. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag contents and correct sizes.
          10.3.2.1.2. ACDE Wear During Ground Operations. Because aircraft contamination is
          unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations represent the highest threat to aircrew
          safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid chemical agents is paramount.
          Aircrew should limit activities to essential duties only, and separate ground duties from air
          duties.
136                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


         10.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled, contam-
         ination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE such as the
         ACDE. The basic concept for most facility collective protective solutions is to employ overpres-
         sure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit. The intent is to provide rest and relief accommodations,
         as well as provide medical treatment in contamination free zone. Crewmembers should avail
         themselves of facilities, if provided, on the airfield.
         10.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to strengthen build-
         ings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To reduce the potential of vapor
         exposure in facilities without collective protection, seal windows and doors, turn off heating, ven-
         tilation, and cooling systems, and use rooms above the first floor, when possible.
      10.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control measures limit
      the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through disease prevention mea-
      sures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations. Effective contamination control
      helps sustain air mobility operations by minimizing performance degradation, casualties, or loss of
      material.
         10.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene practices,
         and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive measures.
         10.3.3.2. Decontamination.
             10.3.3.2.1. In-flight Decontamination. Air washing is a useful in-flight decontamination tech-
             nique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal surfaces. However, vapor haz-
             ards may remain in areas where the airflow characteristics prevent complete off-gassing (i.e.,
             wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are
             recommended, and lower altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes. Fly with the air-
             craft configured (gear, flaps, and slats extended) as long as possible to maximize the airflow in
             and around as many places as possible. Be advised that exterior contamination may seep into
             the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews. Use of ACDE is recommended. Fol-
             low smoke and fume elimination procedures to help purge interior contamination.
             10.3.3.2.2. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and equipment
             may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated assets will be restricted
             to DOD-controlled airfields and not released from US government control.
         10.3.3.3. Exchange Zone (EZ) Operations. The AMC Concept for Air Mobility Operations in a
         Chemical and Biological Environment (CB CONOPS) describes a method for continuing the vital
         flow of personnel into a contaminated airfield while limiting the number of air mobility aircraft
         and personnel exposed to the contaminated environment. The purpose of the EZ is to minimize the
         spread of contamination within the air mobility fleet, preserving as many aircraft as possible for
         unrestricted international flight. The EZ is an area (located at uncontaminated airfield) set aside to
         facilitate the exchange of uncontaminated (clean) cargo/passengers to a contaminated (dirty) air-
         frame, or visa versa, without cross-contamination. Additional information on the EZ is available
         through HQ AMC/A35.

10.4. Flight Operations.
      10.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of CBRNE weap-
      ons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should emphasize ACDE wear,
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 137


  crew coordination, CBRNE hazards and countermeasures, in-flight diversion, plans for onload/off-
  load in the event of a ground attack, and plans for the return leg in the event of aircraft contamination.
  Alternative scenario plans should also be considered in the event mission-oriented protective posture
  (MOPP) conditions change.
  10.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control channels to
  ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination's alert condition. Diversion of
  aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless operational necessity otherwise dictates.
  The 18 AF TACC or theater C2 agency (normally through the controlling OPORD) will direct aircrew
  pre-exposure activities such as medical pre-treatment for chemical/biological exposure, or issue of
  dosimetry for potential radiological hazards.
  10.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions as the
  result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized. Although the
  aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot, thus restricting the air-
  craft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
  10.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen requirements.
  Aircrew wear of ACDE will require use of the aircraft oxygen system to counter actual/suspected con-
  tamination. Using the 100 percent oxygen setting offers the greatest protection in a contaminated
  environment. Appropriate oxygen reservoir levels must be planned to meet higher consumption rates.
  Use the aircraft Dash 1 charts to calculate the required reservoir levels.
  10.4.5. Donning Equipment. Aircrew will don ACDE based on the alarm condition (See Airman’s
  Manual (AFMAN 10-100)). Use the "buddy dressing" procedures, and refer to AMCVA 11-303,
  AERP Donning Checklist, and AMCVA 11-304, ACDE Donning Checklist, to ensure proper wear.
  When wearing the ACDE, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors will be kept in the upper left
  ACDE pocket. If the integrated survival vest/body armor is worn, the Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride
  auto injectors may be kept in the lower right flight suit pocket. This standardized location will enable
  personnel to locate the medication should an individual be overcome by CWA poisoning. M-9 paper
  on the flight suit will facilitate detection of liquid chemical agents and ACCA processing. M-9 paper
  should be placed on the flight suit prior to entering the CBRNE threat area or when an alarm “yellow”
  or higher has been declared. When inbound to a CBRNE threat area, prior to descent, the aircraft com-
  mander will ensure crew and passengers don appropriate protective equipment IAW arrival destina-
  tion's MOPP level and brief aircrew operations in the CBRNE threat area. As a minimum, this briefing
  will include: flight deck isolation, oxygen requirements, air conditioning system requirements, IPE
  requirements, ground operations, and MOPP levels. Aircrew members must determine if the wear of
  the integrated survival vest/body armor and LPUs will restrict dexterity and mobility to the point that
  it becomes a safety issue. If the aircrew deems the equipment to create a safety of flight concern, then
  the items may be pre-positioned (instead of worn) on the aircraft to be readily available to the aircrew.
  10.4.6. Communicating Down-line Support. Pass aircraft and cargo contamination information
  through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be used to determine if
  a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed. Report the physical condition of
  any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and whether they are wearing chemical
  defense ensembles.
138                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


10.5. Ground Operations.
      10.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a contam-
      inated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-flight crews are not
      available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to entering crew rest. The
      departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-flight briefings. Then, they will
      report to the ACCA for processing with assistance from ALS personnel. If possible, aircrew transport
      should be provided in a covered vehicle. Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to
      departure to prevent contamination spread to them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they
      will require assistance from ground support personnel in removing their aircrew protective overcape
      and overboots prior to entering the aircraft.
      10.5.2. Onload and Offload Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent contamina-
      tion spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the flight deck area.
      Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine covers, safety pins and
      chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic bags, and properly marked IAW
      AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations
      and Standards. Aircrew members entering the aircraft will remove plastic overboots and overcape
      portions of the aircrew ensemble and ensure flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and placed
      in clean plastic bags. Prior to entering the aircraft all personnel should implement boot wash/decon-
      tamination procedures. Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated environment will don plastic
      overboots and overcape prior to leaving the aircraft.
      10.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete ACDE,
      complicates communications capability. Use the mini-amplifier/speaker or the aircraft public address
      system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as required.
      10.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from a contam-
      inated to an uncontaminated airbase. Critical requirements are pre-designated in theater war plans.
      Onload cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the aircraft. If contaminated,
      protective cover(s) will be removed/replaced just prior to placing the cargo on the aircraft. It is the
      user's responsibility to decontaminate cargo for air shipment. The airlift of contaminated or formerly
      contaminated cargo requires the approval of the senior transportation commander.
      10.5.5. Passenger/Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and the ground
      transportation vehicle to reduce interior contamination when loading/unloading passengers/patients.
      Normally, externally contaminated patients and those infected with contagious biological agents will
      not be transported onboard AMC or AMC-procured aircraft. The AMC/CC is the waiver authority to
      this policy. NOTE: An altitude below 10,000 feet is recommended due to AECM use of the ground
      chemical mask.
      10.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems resulting
      from physical exertion while wearing ACDE. The aircraft commander should consider factors such as
      ground time, temperature and remaining mission requirements when determining on/offload capabili-
      ties. Individuals involved should be closely monitored for adverse physiological effects.
      10.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize thermal stress
      caused by wearing the ACDE. Aircrews must weigh all factors when performing in-flight and ground
      duties. The following are degradation factors for wearing full GCE, and may also be used to represent
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 139


  the Task Time Multipliers for the ACDE. A more extensive discussion of this subject is found in
  AFMAN 10-2602.
  10.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with actual/sus-
  pected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke and Fume Removal
  procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close inspection of aircrew, passenger ensem-
  bles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9 detection paper. Detection paper only detects
  certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor hazards. Above the shoulder ACDE should only be
  removed if there is absolutely no vapor hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the
  detectable levels of currently fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed space. The
  aircrew must take every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants, especially on the
  flight deck area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid those areas for
  the remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo compartments cool. If an aircrew member or passenger
  has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel aboard the aircraft will stay in full ACDE/
  GCE until processed through their respective contamination control area (CCA). Upon arrival, the
  contaminated aircraft will be parked in an isolated area and cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground
  personnel.
  10.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an aerospace vehi-
  cle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological, biological or chemical contami-
  nant, a Red X will be entered and an annotation will be made in historical records for the lifecycle of
  the equipment.
  10.5.10. 10-Foot Rule. The 10-foot rule was developed in order to provide guidance for protecting
  personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in locations with
  materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 10-foot rule embodies a safety factor that goes
  beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE whenever detectors no longer detect a
  chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases associated with the 10-foot rule.
     10.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4 whenever they
     stay within 10 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few seconds. This MOPP level
     provides personnel the maximum protection from the chemical agent as it transitions from a con-
     tact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
     10.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves (i.e. leather, rub-
     ber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated equipment. Although a contact
     hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent may still be present. The use of gloves
     will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact with agent residue is avoided.
     10.5.10.3. Table 10.1. shows estimated times associated with initial and follow-on phases of the
     10-foot rule. To simplify response processes, commanders may choose to use the worst case sce-
     nario as the foundation for all 10-foot rule actions, i.e., 24 hours for the initial phase and all peri-
     ods of time greater than 24 hours for the follow-on phase.

                                                Chapter 11

                                    NAVIGATION PROCEDURES

11.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures and requirements for worldwide enroute KC-10 nav-
igation. It is to be used in conjunction with procedures and requirements set forth in AFI 11-202, Volume
3, AFMAN 11-217, and FLIP. Since airspace and associated navigational aid equipment capability are
rapidly evolving, pilots must maintain an in depth knowledge of current requirements/policies.

11.2. Navigation Databases. Separate navigational databases are used for flight planning and in-flight
navigation in the KC-10. Navigation databases are updated on a 28-day cycle.
   11.2.1. Flight Planning Navigation Database. Flight plans created using the Advanced Computer
   Flight Plan (ACFP) or the Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS) use navigation data from the
   Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF). Pilots are responsible for ensuring the accuracy
   of flight plan waypoints against current aeronautical charts, terminal instrument procedures, or FLIP
   documents (i.e. AP/1B). These flight plans may be saved to a PCMCIA card and loaded directly into
   the FMS-800 using the FMS data loader.
   11.2.2. Aircraft Navigation Database. The FMS-800 uses a navigation database provided by a com-
   mercial vendor, Jeppesen. This database is stored on a PCMCIA card that is uploaded into the FMS
   prior to flight. When a terminal area procedure (departure procedure, STAR, instrument approach pro-
   cedure) will be flown using FMS as the sole source of navigation information, the procedure to be
   flown must be retrieved in its entirety from the aircraft database and the database must be current.
       11.2.2.1. All waypoint data retrieved from the aircraft navigation database should be verified by
       one or more of the following methods:
           11.2.2.1.1. Latitude/longitude from current FLIP.
           11.2.2.1.2. Bearing/distance from a flight plan after latitude/longitude are verified for each
           waypoint.
           11.2.2.1.3. Ground Based NAVAIDs.
       11.2.2.2. In some cases, waypoints in the database may differ from the charted instrument proce-
       dure. Differences less than 0.3nm are acceptable for GPS overlay approaches. For stand-alone
       GPS and RNAV approaches, the maximum allowable difference is 0.1nm. If distance information
       varies by more than these tolerances, the procedure shall not be flown. Variation between charted
       final approach course in the instrument approach procedure and the final approach course com-
       puted by the aircraft should be no more than 5 degrees. If the two differ by more than 5 degrees,
       the procedure is not authorized.

11.3. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. (See FLIP, FCG, and AP, for further guid-
ance). US military aircraft and DoD personnel entering another nation to conduct US government busi-
ness must have the approval of the foreign government concerned to enter their airspace. Foreign
clearances for US international air operations are obtained through US officials known as Defense
Attaché Officers (DAOs).
   11.3.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and territorial airspace.
   International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states' territorial seas. Military aircraft
142                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


      operate in such areas free of interference or control by the coastal state. Territorial airspace includes
      airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters, inland waters, and land territory, and is sovereign
      airspace. Overflight may be conducted in such areas only with the consent of the sovereign country.
      11.3.2. Consistent with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12NMs. Diplomatic
      constraints and/or a lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions operating in international
      airspace. Therefore, it is imperative sufficient information be provided far enough in advance to allow
      compliance with FCG requirements established by the countries concerned. The US does not nor-
      mally recognize territorial claims beyond 12NMs; however, specific guidance from certain US
      authorities may establish limits, which differ from the standard.
      11.3.3. Flight Information Region (FIR). An FIR is an area of airspace within which flight informa-
      tion and related services are provided. An FIR does not reflect international borders or sovereign air-
      space. Aircraft may operate within an established FIR without approval of the adjacent country,
      provided the PIC avoids flight in territorial airspace.
      11.3.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace into territorial
      airspace, for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not amend entry point(s).
      11.3.5. Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or departure of
      aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace for which a clearance has not been duly
      requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
      11.3.6. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for penetration of
      sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective country. Aircraft clearances
      are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
      11.3.7. If while in international airspace, the ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or
      attempts to negate existing clearances, PICs must evaluate the circumstances. The normal response is
      to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft will continue to planned destination, as cleared in interna-
      tional airspace. The key phrase is "in international airspace." Safety of flight is paramount in deter-
      mining mission continuation. Under no circumstances should aircrews construe a clearance routing
      their mission over sovereign airspace as being valid authorization to enter sovereign airspace unless
      prior approval was received through diplomatic channels before mission departure.
      11.3.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing will normally be
      briefed at home station, onload station, and/or by the last C2 facility transited before performing the
      critical portion of the mission.
      11.3.9. Aircrews (except on weather reconnaissance missions) normally are not tasked to and should
      not fly "due regard" routings unless coordinated with the appropriate MAJCOM C2 and specifically
      directed in the mission FRAG. The "due regard" or "operational" option obligates the military PIC to
      be their own ATC agency to separate their aircraft from all other air traffic. If operational require-
      ments dictate, PICs may exercise the "due regard" option to protect their aircraft. Aircraft will return
      to normal air traffic services as soon as practical. Refer to FLIP GP for additional guidance on due
      regard.

11.4. Navigation Capability.
      11.4.1. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM). Airspace where RVSM is applied is consid-
      ered special qualification airspace. Both the operator and the specific aircraft type must be approved
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                              143


  for operations in these areas. The KC-10 is approved for unrestricted use in RVSM airspace. Always
  refer to the appropriate Area Planning (AP) publication for specific theatre RVSM requirements. In
  addition to the requirements established in the applicable AP publication, always comply with the fol-
  lowing when operating in RVSM airspace:
     11.4.1.1. Both primary altimeters, at least one autopilot, the altitude advisory system, and the
     transponder, must be fully operational. Request a new clearance to avoid this airspace should any
     of this equipment fail.
     11.4.1.2. Engage the autopilot during level cruise, except when circumstances such as the need to
     re-trim the aircraft or turbulence require disengagement.
     11.4.1.3. Crosscheck the altimeters before or immediately upon coast out. Record readings of
     both altimeters.
     11.4.1.4. Continuously crosscheck the primary altimeters to ensure they agree ± 200 feet.
     11.4.1.5. Limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 feet per minute when operating near other aircraft
     to reduce potential TCAS advisories.
     11.4.1.6. Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into RVSM
     airspace and coordinate a plan of action.
     11.4.1.7. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RVSM required equipment,
     including the failure of this equipment to meet RVSM tolerances.
     11.4.1.8. In the North Atlantic Region, Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS)
     airspace is a subdivision of RVSM airspace. Refer to the MNPS manual and FLIP AP/2 for
     detailed requirements when operating in MNPS airspace.
  11.4.2. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace. Airspace where RNP is applied is consid-
  ered special qualification airspace and can be determined by referencing the applicable theatre AP
  publication. The PIC is responsible for a thorough review of the aircraft forms and maintenance logs
  to ascertain the status of RNP equipment. During flight, immediately notify ATC if any of the
  required equipment fails after entry into RNP airspace and coordinate a plan of action. Document in
  the aircraft forms, malfunctions or failures of RNP required equipment, including the failure of this
  equipment to meet RNP tolerances.
     11.4.2.1. RNP-10. Compliance includes navigation accuracy within 10NM of actual position
     95% of the time. KC-10 aircraft may operate in RNP-10 without time limitations. If the capability
     to update the internal navigation solution with the GPS is lost, or if receiver autonomous integrity
     monitoring (RAIM) is lost, the aircraft is limited to 6.2 hours of operation in RNP-10 airspace
     after the GPS or RAIM is degraded.
         11.4.2.1.1. At least two long range navigation systems certified for RNP-10 must be opera-
         tional at the oceanic entry point. Periodic crosschecks will be accomplished to identify naviga-
         tion errors and prevent inadvertent deviation from ATC cleared routes. Advise ATC of the
         deterioration or failure of navigation equipment below navigation performance requirements
         and coordinate appropriate actions.
     11.4.2.2. Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV). The KC-10 is approved for BRNAV operations.
     BRNAV is defined as RNAV with an accuracy that meets RNP-5 for operations under IFR in that
     European airspace designated for BRNAV/RNP-5 operations. When operating in BRNAV air-
144                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


         space, pilots will immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails, or if unable to
         meet BRNAV tolerances. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RNP
         required equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet BRNAV tolerances.
             11.4.2.2.1. Minimum equipment to operate in BRNAV airspace is one INS capable of updates
             or a FAA approved FMS-800 or equivalent system. Flights entering BRNAV airspace after
             long overwater flight must be especially aware of BRNAV tolerances and update accordingly.
             Refer to FLIP AP/2 for additional requirements.
         11.4.2.3. Precision Area Navigation (PRNAV). The KC-10 is approved for PRNAV operations.
         PRNAV is defined as RNAV with an accuracy that meets RNP-1 for operations under IFR in that
         airspace designated for PRNAV/RNP-1 operations. Crews must have completed PRNAV training
         prior to operating on a PRNAV route. When operating in PRNAV airspace, pilots will immedi-
         ately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails, or if unable to meet PRNAV tolerances.
         Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RNP required equipment, including the
         failure of this equipment to meet PRNAV tolerances.
             11.4.2.3.1. Crews conducting PRNAV operations must adhere to the following procedures:
                 11.4.2.3.1.1. Use only the GPS1, GPS2, or INUX/GPSX navigation solutions.
                 11.4.2.3.1.2. Do not fly on a PRNAV route segment after losing both GPS receivers.
                 However, a flight may be continued on a PRNAV segment after the loss of a single GPS.
                 11.4.2.3.1.3. Crews may not fly a PRNAV segment containing a Fix to Altitude leg with
                 the autopilot coupled to the FMS. For example: a missed approach procedure requiring a
                 climb to 3000 ft and then a turn to xxx heading.
                 11.4.2.3.1.4. Both Pilot’s EHSIs must be operational.
                 11.4.2.3.1.5. Crews must ensure the FMS is operating in terminal mode during flight on a
                 PRNAV route segment, unless in approach mode during a RNAV approach.
                 11.4.2.3.1.6. The PF will have the Steer Page with DTK displayed during flight on a
                 PRNAV route segment.

11.5. Oceanic Flight. Maintaining situational awareness during oceanic flight is essential to the safe
conduct of the flight. Situational awareness includes, but is not limited to, positional awareness and accu-
rate fuel updates. This requires due diligence on the part of all aircrew members.
      11.5.1. Oceanic Plotting Charts.
         11.5.1.1. Prior to flight, plot the oceanic portion of the flight on an appropriate chart. Annotate the
         chart with the mission number, PIC’s name, preparer’s name, and date. If practical, chart may be
         reused.
         11.5.1.2. Obtain a coast out fix prior to, or immediately on entering the Category I Route or
         over-water segment. Perform a gross error check using available NAVAIDS and annotate the
         position and time on the chart.
         11.5.1.3. When approaching each waypoint on a Category I route, recheck coordinates for the
         next two waypoints.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 145


       11.5.1.4. Approximately 10 minutes after passing each oceanic waypoint, record and plot the air-
       craft position and time on the chart, and ensure compliance with courses and ETA tolerances.
       11.5.1.5. If a revised clearance is received, record and plot the new route of flight on the chart.
       11.5.1.6. Upon return to home station, turn in the charts (copies if reused) and applicable com-
       puter flight plans to the squadron. Squadrons will retain the charts, computer flight plans, and
       associated materials for a minimum of 3 months.
   11.5.2. Computer Flight Plans.
       11.5.2.1. Aircrews provided with winded flight plans should load planned winds from the CFP
       into the FMS. For Category I routing, aircrews will load planned winds in the FMS. Small changes
       (less than 30 degree direction change and/or 15 knots wind speed) need not be entered for every
       leg.

11.6. FM Immunity (FMI). The KC-10 is equipped with dual FMI VHF navigation receivers and is
considered fully compliant and will follow normal procedures. Refer to the applicable Area Planning
series for more information concerning FMI operations.

                                                  Chapter 12

          FLIGHT ENGINEER / AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT PROCEDURES

12.1. General: This chapter contains flight engineer procedures not contained in the flight manual, other
portions of this AFI, or other publications.

12.2. Responsibilities. The flight engineer is responsible to the PIC for all inspections and procedures
required by the applicable technical orders and regulations.

12.3. Authority to Clear a Red X. Flight engineers are not normally authorized to clear a Red X. If a
situation is encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are not
available to clear it, the highest qualified flight engineer on scene may obtain authorization to clear the
Red X from the home station MXG/CC or designated representative, in accordance with T.O. 00-20-1.
Other crew members are not authorized to clear a Red X. EXCEPTION: The flight engineer may clear
Red Xs for engine covers, pitot covers, gear pins and SPR drains when qualified maintenance personnel
are not available, unless prohibited by the home station MXG/CC or OG/CC.

12.4. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. Flight engineers are normally not required to refuel
or de-fuel aircraft; however, the flight engineer is qualified and authorized to accomplish these duties
when maintenance personnel are not available. This policy is designed for support of the aircraft and its
mission while away from home station. The applicable refueling and de-fueling checklists will be used
during all refueling and de-fueling operations. If ground support personnel are not available, the aircraft
commander will designate other crewmembers to assist the flight engineer. A flight engineer may assist
the normal maintenance function when critical taskings dictate their use, provided this action does not
impact crew duty and crew rest limits specified in Chapter 3 of this AFI.
      12.4.1. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew members qualified in ground refueling may perform refueling
      duties. Aircrews will only refuel in cases when maintenance support is not readily available and the
      mission would be delayed.
         12.4.1.1. Avoid refueling with JP-8+100 while transiting airfields with JP-8+100 capabilities.
         AMC aircraft are not allowed to operate on JP-8+100, except in emergency conditions. All
         JP-8+100 locations are required to maintain a clean JP-8 capability to support transient aircraft. If
         inadvertent refueling with JP-8+100 occurs comply with the following:
             12.4.1.1.1. Make an AFTO Form 781A entry stating “Caution: Aircraft refueled using
             JP-8+100, take preventative measures when de-fueling.”
             12.4.1.1.2. At next station with repair capability, de-fuel the aircraft prior to subsequent flight.
         12.4.1.2. When crewmembers are required to refuel, the flight engineer will act as the refueling
         team supervisor. Flight engineers acting as refueling supervisors and panel operators will comply
         with T.O. 00-25-172 and applicable T.O. 1C-10(K)A-2 series T.O.s. Two other crew members are
         required to assist in the refueling, one for safety duties and the other to act as fire guard. Four total
         are required when the right wing SPR is inoperative and refueling must be accomplished from the
         flight engineer's panel.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                               147


  12.4.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. The PIC and Chief Servicing Supervisor (CSS) will ensure
  aircrew members and servicing personnel accomplish concurrent servicing (CS) in accordance with
  T.O. 00-25-172 and servicing technical orders. Aircrews performing Dash-1 preflight inspections or
  cargo loading concurrent with servicing must have cooperation and close coordination with the CSS.
  The CSS will remain in continuous intercom contact with fuel servicing team members during the
  entire servicing operation. Team members include CSS, Single Point Refueling (SPR) monitor for
  each SPR in use, refueling panel monitor, fuel specialists, and one person to monitor the opposite side
  wing fuel vents. When the aircrew is at the aircraft, the PIC is responsible for all aspects of aircraft
  operations and will inform the CSS how aircrew members will participate in passenger evacuation/
  safety. In keeping with the guidelines in T.O. 00-25-172, CSS has authority over all phases of CS
  operations to include personnel participating in the refuel.
     12.4.2.1. Use the following guidelines when CS operations are conducted with passengers on
     board:
         12.4.2.1.1. Designate a current and qualified crew member as the Passenger Compartment
         Monitor (PCM). The PCM will continuously monitor passengers during CS. PCMs will not
         perform other duties during servicing.
         12.4.2.1.2. Designate a current and qualified crew member to remain on the flight deck to
         monitor interphone and be prepared to broadcast a request for emergency assistance on a radio
         tuned to the appropriate agency with ready access to an emergency response team. The PA
         may be used to direct passenger evacuation in an emergency.
         12.4.2.1.3. The PCM will brief passengers on emergency egress, exits, prohibitions, and haz-
         ards. Passengers will remain seated but will not wear seat belts during CS. When possible,
         conduct this briefing prior to servicing. If servicing is in progress, give the briefing immedi-
         ately after boarding.
         12.4.2.1.4. When authorized, passengers may board or exit the aircraft for the express purpose
         of loading for departure or off-loading upon arrival. Boarding or exiting must be opposite of
         servicing operations. Except for emergencies, once onboard passengers will not deplane dur-
         ing servicing.
         12.4.2.1.5. Passengers are not required to ground themselves.
         12.4.2.1.6. Passenger representatives will assist the PCM when passengers board and exit.
         Passengers must remain outside the vapor hazard area, the fuel servicing safety zone, oxygen
         servicing area, and 25 feet from fuel vents during servicing.
         12.4.2.1.7. The PIC, or designated aircrew representative, or CSS will advise PCMs when to
         evacuate passengers.
         12.4.2.1.8. Unless environmental conditions dictate, the primary emergency exit will remain
         open and stairs in place. Fuel servicing is limited to the right side. Close and arm all doors
         except the open entry door. If entry door is closed due to inclement weather, do not arm. Stairs
         will remain in place.
         12.4.2.1.9. The PCM will set the interior lighting as bright as possible to suit the combat envi-
         ronment.
148                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


             12.4.2.1.10. The boom operator will ensure cargo loading or unloading does not jeopardize
             passenger safety. Do not load/unload cargo containing explosives, oxygen, flammable gases
             or liquids during CS. Boom operators may on/off-load cargo only when the cargo barrier net is
             in place. EXCEPTION: Small floor-loaded cargo may be loaded without the cargo net in
             place.
         12.4.2.2. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
         12.4.2.3. Winching of rolling stock and non-spark producing (i.e. wooden) pallets is authorized.
         Driving vehicles equipped with spark arresters is authorized during fuel servicing. When loading
         vehicles without spark arresters, the vehicles must be either completely inside the cargo compart-
         ment, or outside of the established fuel servicing safety zone, before fuel servicing lines can be
         pressurized. EXCEPTION: Diesel and turbo-charged (without waste gates) gasoline-powered
         vehicles can be on-loaded or off-loaded without stopping fuel flow.
      12.4.3. Additional fuel servicing guidance:
         12.4.3.1. Non-radiating electric and electronic equipment may be left on, but must not be turned
         on or off during servicing.
         12.4.3.2. Pull circuit breakers for radar altimeters.
         12.4.3.3. Turn off TACANs and radar.
         12.4.3.4. IFF/SIF may be in standby, but should be turned off if time permits.
         12.4.3.5. FMS/INU may be “on” and may be updated. Do not turn on or off during servicing.
      12.4.4. Hot Air Refueling. Hot refueling (refueling with aircraft engines running) will only be con-
      ducted by crews authorized and certified according to AFI 11-235, Forward Area Refueling/Rearming
      Point (FARRP) Operations.

12.5. Aircraft Structural Integrity Program. The flight engineer will complete AFTO Form 18,
Structural Assessment Record, on every flight. The AFTO Form 18 documents usage data for the
KC-10A Individual Airplane Tracking Program (IATP). IATP determines the current and projected struc-
tural status of each individual KC-10A and provides information for fleet management; TCTO modifica-
tions, inspections, structural maintenance actions and structural condition
      12.5.1. Use only these instructions, not the abbreviated instructions on the form. This is a machine
      readable document utilizing an optical mark reading system. Do not use reproductions of the form to
      record flight information. Use a number 2 or softer pencil, darkening responses completely. Do not
      use ink or make stray marks outside of the REMARKS section. Do not staple or punch holes.
      12.5.2. Segment Guidelines. The first segment starts at brake release and is a CL or P type. Record
      segment type and all conditions at the start of each segment including time, fuel weight, CG, altitude,
      and speed. Speed and altitude are not required for the initial climb. Start a new CL or D segment when
      climbing or descending beyond an adjacent altitude band. The last segment is a D or P type. An on-/
      off-load segment begins when the receiver is stabilized in pre-contact position and ends when the
      receiver departs the tanker. A P type begins when entering the traffic-pattern, reaching the altitude for
      a low altitude-cruise, or entering low-altitude holding. Flights consisting of more than eight segments
      are continued on another form. On continuation pages, fill out Blocks 1, 3, 4 and 5 along with segment
      blocks as required. Blocks 3, 4, and 5 are the same on all forms for a given flight. Complete Blocks 16

         12.5.2.23. Make separate OFFB and OFFD entries if boom, centerline drogue, and/or WARP
         contacts are made on the same flight.
         12.5.2.24. Block 16. Flight time to the nearest one tenth hour.
         12.5.2.25. Block 17. Clock time as on 781, and fuel weight at engine shut down.
         12.5.2.26. REMARKS. Enter name & rank, duty AF base, duty phone, and mission number on
         each form. Enter receiver type if not listed above. Track WARP cycles for the left and right pods
         separately and report at maintenance debriefing. The definition of a cycle is: fully extending and
         fully retracting the pod hose. Multiple contacts may be made in the interim period between
         extending and retracting the hose without logging additional cycles.
      12.5.3. Complete any open items after landing. Turn in completed forms after each flight or upon
      return to the home station. The Chief Flight Engineer or designated representative will review com-
      pleted forms. Each Monday, forward the past week’s completed forms to OC-ALC/TILO, Tinker
      AFB, OK 73145-5990. CAG(IGDS) SAI(5)-10.

12.6. Engine Performance Monitoring. Engine performance monitoring program data become a per-
manent part of the engine's history. In order to track potential engine failure, make every effort to record
engine performance data on every sortie. Deliver engine coupons to debriefing as soon as possible (not to
exceed 7 days) or faxed in the case of extended missions. Insure coupons are hand-carried to home station
when returning from depot modifications or maintenance input.
      12.6.1. The primary method of KC-10 engine performance monitoring is the EGT divergence
      method. This compares EGT from one engine to another on the same aircraft using number 2 engine
      as the baseline. Data may be collected with the boom and drogue deployed as long as airspeeds remain
      stable, no climbs or descents are initiated, and the receiver is no closer than pre-contact. Discontinue
      procedure any time safety would be compromised.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 151


  12.6.2. Instructions for engine performance monitoring:
     12.6.2.1. Auto throttles off. If possible, allow power to stabilize for 5 minutes.
     12.6.2.2. N1 RPMs aligned to within 0.3% of each other, at not less than 89%.
     12.6.2.3. Stabilized cruise, power stabilized; light turbulence is permissible.
     12.6.2.4. Altitude: 20,000 feet or greater. Above FL 270 is optimum.
     12.6.2.5. Mach: 0.70 or greater.
     12.6.2.6. Record at least one coupon per flight. Two is preferred on long flights.
  12.6.3. Record the following data:
     12.6.3.1. Air Force Serial Number (not tail number.)
     12.6.3.2. Zulu date readings are taken.
     12.6.3.3. Zulu time readings are taken.
     12.6.3.4. Flight engineer's name.
     12.6.3.5. Altitude / 1000.
     12.6.3.6. Total Air Temperature to the closest °C. Ensure positive or negative sign is recorded.
     12.6.3.7. Mach: All 3 numbers, within +.001.
     12.6.3.8. Flight engineer’s flying squadron.
     12.6.3.9. N1 to closest +0.1%.
     12.6.3.10. EGT to the closest degree.
     12.6.3.11. N2 to closest +0.1%.
     12.6.3.12. Fuel flow to nearest 10pph.
     12.6.3.13. Oil pressure to nearest psi.
     12.6.3.14. Bleed configuration (normal is packs on.)
     12.6.3.15. Anti-ice configuration (normal is engine and wing anti-ice off.)
     12.6.3.16. Remarks/Abnormal Configuration: Record non-standard configurations, boom and
     drogue deployed, slats extended, turbulence, alternate method, etc.
  12.6.4. If an indicator becomes erratic or inoperative, record the best estimate of data. Circle the esti-
  mate and document discrepancy on the form and AFTO Form 781A.
  12.6.5. Alternate method. If the primary conditions cannot be met, use this alternate method.
     12.6.5.1. May be accomplished at any altitude and airspeed/Mach.
     12.6.5.2. Auto throttles must be off. Allow power to stabilize for 1 - 3 minutes.
     12.6.5.3. Align N1 RPMs to within 0.3% of each other.
     12.6.5.4. Record only N1 and EGT

152                                                  AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


         12.6.5.6. Compare EGT data with the engine EGT comparison sheet.
      12.6.6. EGT comparison. EGT is the primary indication of CF-6 engine operating condition. Since
      EGT will never shift downward (unless caused by an instrument error), enter any upward shift of
      more than +15°C in the AFTO Form 781A. For example, if the EGT comparison page in the aircraft
      forms indicates engine #1: +13°C, engine #2: baseline, and engine #3: +6°C, then the maximum EGT
      for the #1 engine is baseline plus 28°C, and the maximum EGT for the #3 engine is baseline plus
      21°C. Readings above these maximum values require a 781A entry. If an upward shift of more than
      +15°C is identified, immediately report the condition to home station for guidance. A downward shift
      of both wing engines may indicate a problem with engine #2.
         12.6.6.1. EGT comparison sheets are maintained in each aircraft. Maintenance updates this sheet
         every 60 days based on the engine monitoring data received.

12.7. Performance Data Computations. TO 1C-10(K)A-1-1 is the source for all performance computa-
tions. Use AF IMT 4089 or an approved electronic takeoff and landing data (TOLD) worksheet. Compute
TOLD using TO 1C-10(K)A-1-1 or electronically on an HQ AMC approved KC-10 TOLD calculator.
Data is computed (manual or electronic) by the flight engineer and checked by another current and quali-
fied pilot or flight engineer. Check data using TO 1C-10(K)A-1-1 or TO 1C-10(K)A-1CL-2 tab data. If
electronic data is found to be out of limits, not due to a data entry error, complete a manual TOLD card.
      12.7.1. TOLD Check Limits. TOLD verification limits are: speeds +/- 3 KIAS; N1 settings +/- 0.3%;
      distances +/- 500 feet. Critical field length must be equal to or less than runway available. Landing
      distance must be equal to or less than runway length.
      12.7.2. Slip Stick. Slip stick will not be used for performance data computations or to verify perfor-
      mance data.
      12.7.3. Fixed Flap Takeoffs. Fixed flap takeoffs, at 15 or 22 degrees, may be executed for initial or
      full-stop taxi backs from a main operating base. Use optimum flap procedures at all other fields.
         12.7.3.1. Compute an optimum flap takeoff setting for the given conditions.
         12.7.3.2. A fixed flap takeoff may be executed if the 15- or 22-degree flap line for the Takeoff
         Gross Weight (TOGW) falls below the Runway Available Limiting Weight (RALW) and Climb
         Gradient Limiting Weight (CGLW) lines (sheet 3 tree chart of TO 1C-10[K]A-1-1), and the
         TOGW is less than Maximum Takeoff Gross Weight (MTOGW). Use fixed flap setting for all
         performance computations.

12.8. Fuel Planning. All fuel planning factors are described in Chapter 14. AF IMT 4091 is used to
record pertinent data throughout mission planning, preflight, flight, and postflight.
      12.8.1. Instructions for completing AF IMT 4091. Only those sections required for the mission or
      through local guidance need be completed. Units may supplement this with additional local guidance
      for NERCCs, standardized alternates, etc. Complete the Time and Fuel Analysis prior to every flight
      to verify flight plan computations. Most entries are self-explanatory. Blocks 1 through 13 provide a
      worksheet to aid in completing Time and Fuel Analysis.
         12.8.1.1. Block 14 – Enroute. Time and fuel from start of second segment climb to Begin Descent
         Point at destination. Includes transition fuel at enroute locations.
         12.8.1.2. Block 15 – Cat 1 reserve. Fuel from Block 4.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                  153


       12.8.1.3. Block 16 – Decompression fuel. Enter fuel from Block 9, but never less than zero.
       12.8.1.4. Block 17 – Alternate/remote island. Since remote or island destination fuel may be
       required in lieu of an alternate at a remote or island destination, enter the additional one hour and
       15 minutes of holding fuel here.
       12.8.1.5. Block 18 - Holding. Enter 45 minutes or 12,000 pounds, whichever is greater. When fil-
       ing to a destination where the alternate is located in Alaska or at latitudes greater than 59 degrees,
       add the additional 30 minutes of holding for total of 1+15.
       12.8.1.6. Block 19 - Descent, Approach & Landing. Use CFP numbers from the Begin Descent
       Point to landing. Otherwise compute descent fuel from Section 8 of TO 1C-10(K)A-1-1, then add
       15 minutes and 3000 pounds for approach and landing.
       12.8.1.7. Block 20 - AR On/Offload. Enter the amount from Block 12.
       12.8.1.8. Block 21 - Identified Extra. Compute as per Chapter 14.

       12.8.1.10. Block 23 - Required Ramp Fuel Load. Add Blocks 14 thru 22.
       12.8.1.11. Block 24 - Actual Ramp Fuel Load. Self explanatory.
       12.8.1.12. Block 25 - Unidentified Extra. Subtract Block 23 from Block 24. If this value exceeds
       10,000 pounds, consider de-fueling. This block should not be less than zero.
       12.8.1.13. Block 26 - Minimum Fuel at Begin Descent Point. Add blocks 17, 18 and 19.
       12.8.1.14. Block 27 - Endurance at Begin Descent Point. Block 24, minus Block 22, minus Block
       14, plus/minus Block 20, divided by 15,000 pounds per hour.
       12.8.1.15. Block 28 - Total Endurance. Block 14 plus Block 27. This value should be entered onto
       the DD Form 175 or 1801.
       12.8.1.16. Block 29 - AR Onload Endurance. Planned onload divided by 15,000 pounds per hour.
       This value should be entered onto the DD Form 175 or 1801.

12.9. General Navigation Duties. The flight engineer performs navigation duties using the FMS. FMS
operations may include waypoint loading, updating navigation information for the various modes of FMS
operation, extraction of coordinates from maps for loading into navigation equipment (e.g. revised AR
tracks), recording of latitude and longitudinal coordinates during AR or emergencies, and use of computer
flight plans to maintain a fuel "how goes it" log when required.
   12.9.1. Mission Planning. The flight engineer assists the pilots in extracting data from maps and
   charts, plotting headings or TACAN and VOR radials, determining wind factors, and mission timing.
   12.9.2. Preflight. Time permitting, the flight engineer may load the flight plan into the FMS.
   12.9.3. In-Flight. Use the FMS to check flight progress and fuel status at pre-selected points along the
   route of flight. The flight engineer will take an active role in maintaining awareness of aircraft loca-
   tion and position along the flight path. This includes assisting pilots in loading and verifying new or
   updated waypoints. Use the FMS to determine time, distance, and fuel requirements for all in-flight
   diversions. The #3 FMS may be used to monitor mission progress in relation to required AR start, end
   AR, and abort points during receiver deploy and re-deployment missions.

12.10. Weight and Balance. The flight engineer assists the boom operator by positioning fuel to satisfy
ballast requirements for cargo loading operations. The flight engineer has sole responsibility for aircraft
weight and balance after DD Form 365-4 is completed and the aircraft is ready for flight. The flight engi-
neer is responsible for completion of DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F-Trans-
port/Tactical, in the absence of a qualified boom operator.
      12.10.1. Center of Gravity (CG) Computations. CG will be computed and tracked using the Zero Fuel
      Weight (ZFW) and ZFW CG provided by the boom operator using AF Form 4087 and AF Form 4088.

12.11. In-Flight Troubleshooting. Flight engineers may accomplish minor troubleshooting in-flight.
However, flight crews will not, nor will they allow, maintenance personnel to perform in-flight mainte-
nance to include indiscriminately pulling circuit breakers or de-powering aircraft systems, swapping com-
ponents, or any other actions that could jeopardize safety of flight.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 155

                     CARGO AND PASSENGER HANDLING PROCEDURES

13.1. General. The boom operator (BO) coordinates on/offloading with air terminal operations or ship-
ping agencies; plans loads; and supervises on/offloading operations. Performs pre/postflight checks of air-
craft and systems, and computes aircraft weight and balance. Provides for the safety/comfort of
passengers and troops, and ensures security of cargo, mail, and baggage during flight.

13.2. Responsibilities of Aircraft Loading.
   13.2.1. AMC Designated Stations.
       13.2.1.1. Aerial port personnel are responsible for selecting cargo and mail for airlift, promptly
       completing documentation, palletizing cargo, load planning (as required), computing load distri-
       bution, and moving cargo to and from the aircraft to meet scheduled departure. They will advise
       the BO of destination, size, weight, and type of cargo (classified, hazardous, etc.) before starting
       loading operations to permit proper positioning. They will also coordinate traffic activities affect-
       ing on/offloading and assign sufficient air freight loading personnel for cargo handling. Aerial
       port personnel are responsible for safe positioning of material handling equipment (MHE) and
       cargo to or from the aircraft cargo door, ramp, or auxiliary ground loading ramps. Under supervi-
       sion of the BO, aerial port personnel prepare the aircraft for loading, stow loading/tiedown equip-
       ment if the aircraft is not to be reloaded, physically load the aircraft and tie down cargo and
       equipment, and release tie-down and physically offload cargo.
       13.2.1.2. The BO is responsible for aircraft preflight, load planning; preparation of weight and
       balance documentation; completing all required load/tipping computations; certifying load plans;
       operating aircraft equipment; supervising and directing on/offloading operations; and cargo tie
       down. They coordinate with the loading crew supervisor to verify cargo against manifests. The
       BO supervises loading operations and is responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of
       the aircraft. BOs may be required to assist maintenance personnel to configure the aircraft for IAU
       on/offloading. The BO will notify the PIC, C2, or terminal operations officer if loading personnel
       are injured or cargo, aircraft equipment, or aircraft structure is damaged during on/offloading. The
       BO will brief the PIC on any hazardous cargo prior to engine start.
       13.2.1.3. Loads planned by qualified load planners will be accepted by the BO and loaded aboard
       the aircraft as planned, unless the load or any portion of it will compromise flight safety or does
       not comply with applicable aircraft technical orders or USAF/AMC publications. If cargo is
       refused or rearranged for these reasons, forward all applicable information, including a copy of the
       load plan, to HQ AMC/A37VK through Stan/Eval channels. AMC personnel attach an AMC
       Form 54.
       EXCEPTION: The BO may deviate from load plans to facilitate ease of on/offloading of cargo
       and to alleviate unnecessary aircraft reconfiguration without submitting documentation. The BO
       must take into consideration the next station’s cargo configuration requirements and will ensure
       the aircraft is in proper weight and balance, zone and tipping limits.
       13.2.1.4. The BO is the on-scene expert for load planning and accepting cargo for airlift. Some
       loads are not specifically detailed in applicable directives and may require the BO to seek advice
156                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


         of other personnel (i.e., available boom operators, squadron, group, wing or HQ AMC/A37VK
         evaluators).
      13.2.2. At locations without AMC air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes responsibili-
      ties as described in paragraph 13.2.1.1. and provides sufficient qualified personnel and MHE for on/
      offloading. BO’s responsibilities and authority are the same as described in paragraph 13.2.1.2. and
      13.2.1.3.
      13.2.3. During Joint Airborne Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT), Special Assignment Airlift
      Mission (SAAM), USAF mobility, and contingency missions, the BO can accept DD2133, Airlift
      Inspection Record, Joint, as a valid pre-inspection of equipment being offered for air shipment. This
      form, validated by two joint inspection signatures (user and transporting force), may be used in lieu of
      the applicable portions of the T.O. 1C-10A-9CL-1. The DD2133 will not be used to document prepa-
      ration of hazardous materials. This will be accomplished using the Shipper's Declaration for Danger-
      ous Goods.

13.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles.
      13.3.1. There must be a reasonable degree of access to the rear of the aircraft, and passengers and
      troops must have ready access to emergency exits. Load aircraft in such a manner that allows for
      movement from the flight deck to the ARO compartment and access to cargo for fire fighting (except
      in the “all cargo” Code “E” configuration when access to only one side of the cargo is required).
NOTE: All passenger hand-carried items must be of a size to fit under the seat and must not obstruct the
safety aisles. Any items that do not fit under a seat or obstruct an aisle way will be stowed with checked
baggage and secured for flight.
      13.3.2. When in PSP configuration “H or I,” the seats aft of the litters will only be occupied by AE
      personnel or additional crew members. Aircraft portable oxygen cylinders will be made available for
      authorized personnel occupying the affected seats.
      13.3.3. Ensure that only adult, English-speaking passengers are seated next to emergency exits. Do
      not seat mothers with infants, children under 15 years old, or physically challenged persons, in seats
      adjacent to emergency exits.
      13.3.4. To assist in emergency evacuation of passengers when the IAU is used, extra crew members
      or maintenance personnel knowledgeable of emergency evacuation procedures will occupy the seats
      closest to 2 R/L doors and 1R door for all takeoffs and landings. They will be briefed on emergency
      evacuation procedures/duties IAW Section II of T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1.

13.4. Pre-Mission Duties.
      13.4.1. Cargo Missions.
         13.4.1.1. The BO, in coordination with aerial port personnel, establishes loading times. Loading
         times that differ from the normal pre-departure sequence of events will be established, with PIC
         coordination, before the BO enters crew rest. Loading time is governed by the type of load and
         complexity of loading procedures (bulk, palletized, etc.) not by port saturation or management of
         aerial port workload levels. When reporting for duty, the BO checks in with the air terminal oper-
         ation center (ATOC) or other designated location to obtain load breakdown and assist in load plan-
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                              157


     ning as required. The BO will ensure that a fully stocked and serviceable hazardous cargo spill kit
     or Protective Clothing Kit (PCK) is onboard prior to cargo upload.
     13.4.1.2. Proper cargo documentation must accompany each load. A consolidated statement
     (manifest) will be delivered to the aircraft prior to departure unless one is not available due to a
     lack or failure of the manifest processing equipment. In this case, a cargo listing or floppy disks
     containing manifest information must accompany the load.
     13.4.1.3. Make every effort to exchange tiedown equipment on a one-for-one basis. If this is not
     possible, annotate the AF IMT 4069. At non-AMC stations, 463L pallets will normally be
     exchanged on a one-for-one basis.
     13.4.1.4. Phase II on/offload operations are not authorized for the KC-10 aircraft.
  13.4.2. Passenger Missions. Maximize seat availability on all missions. The fold-down observer seat
  on the flight deck is not normally considered an available seat; the PIC is the final authority when
  releasing this seat for crew or passenger use.
     13.4.2.1. Whenever the aircraft is configured with an increased accommodation unit (IAU),
     ensure that all latch pawls, anti-rattle handles, ramps, and electrical connections are serviceable
     and in their proper configurations.
     13.4.2.2. When planning any KC-10 mission that includes more than ten passengers, a dedicated
     baggage pallet is required. Floor loading of passenger baggage is not authorized. Floor loading of
     small amounts of crew baggage, professional gear, meals, water jug or medical litters, etc., as
     detailed in T.O. 1C-10(K)A-9 is authorized.
         13.4.2.2.1. Manifesting. Passenger service or airfield management operations personnel man-
         ifest passengers at locations with an AMC passenger processing activity.
         13.4.2.2.2. The PIC and BO are responsible for ensuring all passengers are properly mani-
         fested.
         13.4.2.2.3. At locations without an AMC passenger processing activity it may be necessary
         for crews to perform passenger service functions at stations that do not have this capability.
         These functions include manifesting, anti-hijacking processing, and ensuring visa/passport
         requirements are met. Do not hesitate to contact TACC/XOGX, Aerial Port Control Center;
         DSN 779-0350/0355, commercial 618-229-0350/0355, if any questions arise such as to who
         may travel to specific locations or passport/visa requirements. Aircraft operating within other
         MAJCOMs which have operational command and control over that aircraft will contact the
         appropriate AMOCC for specific details. File a copy of the passenger manifest (DD2131) with
         the flight plan. If not filed with the flight plan, annotate the location of the manifest on the
         flight plan IAW AFI 11-202V3.
         13.4.2.2.4. When the aircrew accomplishes manifesting, anti-hijack-processing is completed
         by the aircrew IAW AFI 13-207.
     13.4.2.3. A passenger service representative or crew member will assist passengers at the bottom
     of the steps, and the BO will assist in seating passengers. Make every effort to seat families
     together to minimize confusion during an emergency egress. DVs, passengers requiring assis-
     tance, and families should be boarded first to minimize separating them.
158                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


         13.4.2.4. When children under the age of two are accepted as passengers, their sponsor has the
         option to either hold the child or place him/her in a Department of Transportation-approved infant
         car seats (ICS). Although the use of ICS for children processed through AMC-owned or controlled
         terminals (including gateways) is no longer mandatory, all passengers (duty and space A), regard-
         less of age, are required to be assigned their own seat. This policy provides an infant and their
         sponsor with a dedicated seat, allowing the use of an ICS seat at the sponsor’s discretion; this mir-
         rors current FAA (commercial) standards. The FAA has banned the use of booster seats, har-
         nesses, and vest child restraints.
            13.4.2.4.1. Passengers may hand-carry their ICS. If used, secure the ICS to a seat using the
            seat belt. To prevent blocking an exit route, the ICS should not be used in an aisle seat. Adults
            will not hold the ICS during any phase of flight. In the event of turbulence or an emergency
            landing, it is highly recommended for infants to be secured in an ICS.
         13.4.2.5. Download the baggage of no-show passengers and those removed from a flight. In the
         case of SAAM or exercise missions at non-AMC locations, coordinate with CRG or deploying
         unit CC to decide if downloading of baggage is necessary.
         13.4.2.6. Ensure all cabin doors without stairs are closed and armed prior to passenger boarding.
         To ensure safety, air stairs will be utilized to the maximum extent possible for passenger and troop
         on/offloading. Once passengers have been on-loaded the air stairs may be released and a B1-1
         stand may be repositioned at the door.
            13.4.2.6.1. Use caution when on/offloading passenger without air stairs. The PIC is the final
            authority on whether passengers/troops will be on/offloaded when air stairs are unavailable.
            13.4.2.6.2. Movement of large-bodied passengers (passengers who cannot be safely
            restrained in a single aircraft seat using a single seatbelt) is authorized on the KC-10. Seat belt
            extenders, when used, must meet Technical Standard Order (TSO) C22g and may be locally
            purchased by the APS unit.
            13.4.2.6.3. Decisions regarding eligibility or acceptance of a differently abled passenger for a
            flight need to be determined at the lowest level possible. Problems concerning eligibility or
            acceptance that cannot be resolved locally must be reported (circumstances, chronology,
            names, units, etc.) to HQ AMC/A43. For time-sensitive problems, telephone HQ AMC/A43P
            DSN 779-4592 or HQ 18AF TACC/APCC.
         13.4.2.7. RUSH baggage movement will be accomplished IAW AMCI 24-101V15, Military Air-
         lift--Baggage Service. The BO will ensure ATOC provides a copy of the AMC Form 70, RUSH
         Baggage Manifest, for the shipment of rush baggage.

13.5. Passenger Handling.
      13.5.1. The BO is key to good passenger relations. The following common sense rules should be
      observed:
         13.5.1.1. Address passengers by proper titles.
         13.5.1.2. Avoid arguments and controversial subjects, national or international politics, and/or
         criticism of other personnel or organizations.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                            159


     13.5.1.3. Offer services or perform duties in a manner indicating a personal interest and willing-
     ness to help.
  13.5.2. Comments by the BO and the manner in which they are made often determine passenger atti-
  tudes about the flight. Always remember that passengers are individuals; address them collectively
  only when making announcements.
     13.5.2.1. Ensure crewmember’s entertainment media (magazines, DVD, etc.) are of an appropri-
     ate nature.
  13.5.3. In-flight Procedures.
     13.5.3.1. Passengers may move about the cabin after reaching cruise altitude; however, judgment
     must be exercised on the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at any one time. Encour-
     age passengers to remain seated with their seat belts fastened. Discourage passengers from con-
     gregating around galley, lavatory and crew bunk areas.
     13.5.3.2. Make frequent checks on cabin temperature, passengers with small children, and clean-
     liness of the forward cabin, galley and lavatories.
     13.5.3.3. Do not allow passengers to tamper with emergency equipment.
     13.5.3.4. On long flights, particularly during hours of darkness, use all possible means to make
     passengers comfortable such as dimming and/or extinguish unnecessary compartment lights.
     13.5.3.5. Passengers may visit the flight deck or ARO only when approved by the PIC. Use good
     judgment when requesting this authority. Passengers must be escorted by a crewmember to and
     from these areas. Primary crewmembers will be notified when passengers are in transit between
     the passenger compartment and the ARO compartment. Brief all passengers visiting the flight
     deck or ARO compartment on the use of the quick-donning mask/oxygen system. The total num-
     ber of individuals on the flight deck or in the ARO compartment at any one time will not exceed
     the number of seats with seat belts and operable oxygen regulators.
         13.5.3.5.1. The cargo compartment is off limits to all passengers unless properly supervised.
         Passengers will not be permitted access to checked baggage.
         13.5.3.5.2. Supervise passengers for the entire period of flight. During AR, if an extra crew-
         member is on board, one crewmember will remain in the passenger compartment. When this is
         not feasible the following procedures apply:
         13.5.3.5.3. Brief passengers to remain seated and to observe and comply with advisory signs.
         13.5.3.5.4. The FE may monitor passengers from the flight deck when 40 or fewer passengers
         are on board.
         13.5.3.5.5. Notify the PIC of any unusual circumstance relating to the passengers.
         13.5.3.5.6. When passengers are carried, a crewmember knowledgeable in passenger proce-
         dures will be in the passenger compartment for all takeoffs and landings. With a basic crew,
         carry a maximum of 40 passengers. Seat passengers from front to back using all available
         seats.
  13.5.4. Meal Service. The AMC Form 148, Boarding/Pass Ticket, indicates if a meal was ordered
  by a passenger.
160                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


         13.5.4.1. Meals are served at normal hours when practical, based on the local time at point of
         departure. Avoid waking passengers to offer meals. Ask the PIC about expected flight conditions
         prior to meal preparation.
         13.5.4.2. For passengers who ordered a meal, serve meals in the following sequence:
             13.5.4.2.1. Small children requiring assistance.
             13.5.4.2.2. Distinguished Visitors (DV).
             13.5.4.2.3. All other passengers.
         13.5.4.3. Use the following procedures for box lunches:
             13.5.4.3.1. Ensure each passenger receives the meal ordered by verifying the passenger's
             AMC Form 148.
         13.5.4.4. Do not serve liquids or hot food during turbulence.
         13.5.4.5. Turn in all meals unfit for consumption to the first in-flight kitchen. If in radio contact
         with the issuing station, relay aircraft tail number, mission identifier, number of spoiled meals (by
         menu), issuing organization, and in the case of frozen meals, the manufacturing agency and man-
         ufacturer's lot number.
         13.5.4.6. When prepared meals have not been furnished to passengers, annotate the individual's
         boarding pass to reflect reimbursement is authorized. Inform passengers they may receive refunds
         at the next station or the originating or destination terminal.
             13.5.4.6.1. Ensure all food items are removed from the aircraft by fleet and returned to the
             in-flight kitchen if an extended delay occurs. Ensure a copy of AF IMT 129, Tally In-Out, is
             received from fleet service to relieve the BO of meal accountability.
         13.5.4.7. Complimentary snacks and beverages are authorized on TWCF funded missions
         (including AFRC flown missions) for passenger consumption only. Complimentary snacks are not
         authorized on JA/ATT, Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) exercises, or SAAM missions. The squadron or
         port operations officer will ensure snacks and beverages are placed on board when departing AMC
         stations. When departing from other stations and no snacks or beverages are placed onboard, the
         BO may obtain required snacks and beverages from the local in-flight kitchen. Direct the in-flight
         kitchen to bill the accounting and finance office at the aircraft's home station. Record all unused
         snacks and beverages on AF IMT 129 and return to the in-flight kitchen for turn-in credit.
         13.5.4.8. When the aircraft is in the 75 seat configuration, and/or when more than 12 passengers
         are carried, frozen meals will not be accepted for passengers. Paragraph 13.5.4.1. information
         applies.

13.6. Not Used.

13.7. Enroute and Post Flight Duties.
      13.7.1. At stations where a crew change is made and loading or offloading is required, the inbound
      BO is responsible for offloading the aircraft. The outbound BO is responsible for planning and load-
      ing the outbound load.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                               161


   13.7.2. At crew stage points, brief relief personnel about passenger and aircraft equipment, any miss-
   ing items, the location of through cargo, mail and baggage, and any information pertinent to through
   passengers. Point out cargo requiring special consideration (hazardous material, perishables, etc.). If
   unable to conduct a face to face briefing, leave writing instructions with the cargo manifest or local
   C2.
   13.7.3. Assist passengers to deplane. If BLUE BARKS, DVs, COIN ASSIST, or couriers are on
   board, the BO will inform the protocol or traffic representative respectively.

13.8. Loaded Weapons. Weapons are considered loaded if a magazine or clip is installed in the weapon.
This applies even though the clip or magazine is empty.
   13.8.1. Personnel who will engage an enemy force immediately on arrival (actual combat) may carry
   basic combat loads on their person. Weapons will remain clear with magazines or clips removed until
   immediately prior to exiting the aircraft. The troop commander will coordinate with the BO prior to
   directing personnel to load any weapons.
   13.8.2. Personnel who will not immediately engage an enemy force will store basic ammunition loads
   in a centralized palletized location for redistribution on arrival at the objective. Magazines or clips
   will not be inserted into weapons.

13.9. Weight and Balance.
   13.9.1. Weight balance may be accomplished using anyone of following methods:
       13.9.1.1. Manually using the DD365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form-F, Transport/
       Tactical.
       13.9.1.2. Electronically using the HP-41 computer.
       13.9.1.3. Electronically using the HQ AMC/A37VK and KC-10 SPO approved handheld com-
       puter and printer combinations.
           13.9.1.3.1. All portable handheld computer combinations EMI tested IAW AFI 11-202V3,
           and approved by HQ AMC/A37VK, may be used to calculate weight and balance data for the
           KC-10.
   13.9.2. The BO will file the original DD365-4 at the departure airfield and maintain a physical or
   electronic copy for the duration of the flight.

13.10. Cargo Validation On/Offloading Procedures and Format. Use the following format when
tasked to validate a new loading procedure or when encountering any cargo you feel requires special or
specific on/offloading or tiedown procedures not currently listed in T.O. 1C-10(K)A-9. After completion,
send through standardization channels to HQ AMC/A37VK.
   13.10.1. General Loading Data:
       13.10.1.1. Nomenclature of item. Give military or civilian name, national stock number (NSN),
       and a brief description of the item; i.e., dump truck, medical van, etc.
       13.10.1.2. Dimensions (in inches). Length, width, and height. Rough drawing or picture of the
       unit pointing out critical dimensions, projections, overhangs, etc.
162                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


         13.10.1.3. Weight (in pounds). Gross weight; individual axle weight; or data plate weight if pos-
         sible.
      13.10.2. Number of loading crew personnel/BOs required to on/offload cargo and their position to
      observe clearances, if required.
      13.10.3. Equipment and Material Requirements. Special equipment and material required to on/off-
      load cargo; i.e., cargo winch, prime mover, shoring requirements.
      13.10.4. Aircraft Configuration Required.
      13.10.5. Preparation of Cargo for Loading. Components that must be removed or reconfigured to on/
      offload cargo (i.e., helicopter struts, exhaust stacks, cabs, etc.).
      13.10.6. On/offloading Procedures.
      13.10.7. Location of Tiedown Points.
      13.10.8. Comments.

13.11. Emergency Airlift of Personnel. Apply the following procedures to ensure a safe, efficient load-
ing method for the emergency airlift of personnel from areas faced with enemy siege, hostile fire, for
humanitarian reasons, or when directed by the TACC.
      13.11.1. Emergency airlift normally is accomplished without the use of individual seats or safety
      belts. The maximum number of personnel who may be airlifted by seating them on a pallet sub-floor
      in the cargo compartment will vary. Seat personnel in rows facing forward and load in small groups of
      8-10 per pallet so they may be positioned and restrained by connecting the pre-positioned tie-down
      straps from the left and right outboard pallet rings. Load personal effects/baggage in any safe avail-
      able pallet position.
      13.11.2. The maximum altitude for emergency airlift will not exceed FL 250.

13.12. Rucksacks. The following procedures apply to loading rucksacks.
      13.12.1. Rucksacks will not be floor loaded.
      13.12.2. During administrative (training) deployments, rucksacks may be loaded on deploying vehi-
      cles or palletized.
      13.12.3. Rucksacks will not normally fit under the seats without obstructing the aisle way, therefore
      during administrative deployments they must be palletized or loaded on deploying vehicles.
      13.12.4. During tactical deployments into a FOB/OB, rucksacks not loaded on vehicles will be car-
      ried by the individuals onto the aircraft. Allocate pallet space on the load plan for loading rucksacks.
      13.12.5. Ensure that all rucksacks are properly secured and their weight accounted for on the Form F
      and all load computations.

13.13. Hazardous Cargo.
      13.13.1. AMCH 11-214, AMC Aircrew Hazardous Material Handbook, contains a description of the
      types and classes of hazardous cargo that may be carried. Ensure all procedures contained in AMCH
      11-214 are complied with when airlifting hazardous cargo on AMC missions.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                163


   13.13.2. For more information regarding hazardous materials, refer to AFMAN 24-204.

13.14. Cargo and Material Handling Equipment (MHE) Issues.
   13.14.1. Joint Task Force/C2 Module. The C2 module (CCM) is a 36-foot long Airstream-type trailer
   built in 3 sections commonly referred to as the “Silver Bullet.” Each section is permanently mounted
   on 12-foot long airdrop pallets. Since the trailer is not FAA certified for occupancy during takeoff or
   landing, do not occupy for takeoff or landing. Procedures for installing the module are in Section 5 of
   T.O. 1C-10(K)A-9 and Chapter 25 of this instruction.
      13.14.1.1. The module has the capability to carry up to 10 personnel, four in seats with seat belts.
      When cleared by the PIC the communications suite operator and flight attendants (FAs) will pro-
      ceed to the module after take-off, establish power application, and establish interphone contact
      with the cockpit. Once interphone contact has been established, additional personnel will be
      cleared to the module. The right side section of the environmental curtain and cargo barrier net
      should be stowed to allow easy access to the module after passing 10,000 feet MSL and reinstalled
      after the module has been cleared prior to final landing. Interphone contact will be established and
      maintained with the module operator anytime the module is occupied.
      13.14.1.2. The CCM is equipped with 10 EPOS units. In the event of a loss of cabin pressuriza-
      tion all occupants of the module will don the EPOS and proceed to the forward cabin when
      directed by the AC or a uniformed flight crewmember. Once seated in the forward cabin, they will
      be directed to use the drop-down masks as required.
      13.14.1.3. The PIC remains responsible for the safety of all occupants of the module, and all addi-
      tional individuals associated with the mission.
      13.14.1.4. Normally, FAs will accompany the CCM and manage the DV and accompanying
      party. When reporting for the mission, they will provide the PIC with a current ground training
      report and copy of the most current AF IMT 8 certifying that they are current and qualified to
      operate equipment on the KC-10. FAs are qualified to operate doors (normal and emergency oper-
      ation), brief and monitor passengers, accomplish customs and border clearance, and operate emer-
      gency equipment located in the forward cabin and cargo compartment. The lead FA will
      coordinate duties with the senior BO before the mission. Management of the DV and party is the
      primary responsibility of the senior FA; however, the overall responsibility of managing the for-
      ward cabin and cargo compartment rests with the senior BO on board the aircraft.
   13.14.2. Wide Body Loaders (TA-40 and Tunner). These loaders have an adapter that is used for
   loading the lower lobe of a B-747. It protrudes out from the front edge of the loader but does not run
   the entire length of the loader platform. When positioned against the door of the KC-10 there is a gap
   on the loader operator’s side of the loader approximately 40 inches long and 20 inches deep from the
   doorsill to the loader. This may present a safety hazard. If it does, the BO should request the operator
   remove the extension. This type of adapter is also found on various types of commercial loaders.
   13.14.3. 9-Ton High-Lift Truck. Currently there is no available technical data or aircraft loading pro-
   cedures available for this vehicle. However, there is a guide available on the AMC/A37V site. The
   nine-ton high-lift truck may be encountered at ACC bases or at FOBs. Because of the hazards of load-
   ing and the availability of other suitable MHE, the 9-ton truck should not be used to load cargo on the
   KC-10. Apply for waivers through HQ AMC/A37VK DSN 779-7852/3416 on a case-by-case basis.

      13.14.4. Lithium Batteries. The recommended fire agents listed in AFMAN 24-204 are water, CO2 or
      a class D fire extinguisher. These agents will only help reduce the intensity of the fire until the lithium
      expends itself. The use of water is not recommended on the KC-10 because water presents a hazard to
      electronic equipment located in the center accessory compartment and ARO compartment. AFMAN
      24-204 states that the shipper must provide any special equipment required. Aircraft potable water
      will not be used as a fire suppression system for lithium batteries.
      13.14.5. Hazardous Materials in ISU-90 Containers. Load plans must allow in-flight access in event
      of an emergency, or hazardous materials will be removed from the container. Some containers have
      built-in “HAZMAT” access panels; however, when these containers are utilized, any hazardous mate-
      rials must be positioned to permit access through the panel. EXCEPTION: See AFMAN 24-204 for
      hazardous cargo not required to be accessible in-flight. Hazardous materials in the upper compartment
      of the container are inaccessible unless the adjacent pallet position is left empty to facilitate opening
      the doors. If the person responsible for the container is not on board, the key or combination for locks
      on containers must be on the container adjacent to the lock. AMC inspectors and aircrew are autho-
      rized access on all cargo containers placed on AMC aircraft except when waived by HQ AMC/A3 for
      security reasons.
      13.14.6. Removal/Addition of Aircraft Equipment. Missing or removed items that are considered part
      of the normal aircraft configuration, such as cargo loading rails or pieces of the walkway, do not con-
      stitute a non-standard configuration. If these items are onboard but strapped to a pallet or are com-
      pletely removed from the aircraft, make an adjustment to the aircraft weight and balance computation
      (refer to “Chart A” for weights/moments of these items). Carrying more than the normal (4) IAU pal-
      lets does not constitute a non-standard configuration. When the additional pallets are onboard and
      there is other cargo manifested as hazardous, check it’s compatibility with regard to the oxygen gen-
      erating units on the IAU. The oxygen generators installed in the IAU seats are classified as Hazard
      Class 5.1, with a UN Identification Number of UN3356. Additional IAU pallets are still considered
      aircraft equipment and do not need to be manifested as cargo, nor do they require Shipper’s Declara-
      tions for Dangerous Goods.
      13.14.7. Weissenfel MB-1 Chain and 1998 Davis MB-1 Devices. Effective immediately, the Weis-
      senfel MB-1 chain will not be used. The Weissenfel MB-1 chain can be identified by the word
      W-ITALY stamped on the chain hook. The 1998 Davis MB-1 tiedown device will not be used. These
      devices can be identified by a stamp reading contract number SPO470-98-C-5103. Remove any Weis-
      senfel MB-1 chain or 1998 Davis MB-1 device from the aircraft. Examine chained palletized cargo
      for these chains and devices. If they are found, replace them with other chains and devices. Return the
      chains and devices to maintenance or the aerial port activity.
      13.14.8. Configuration Waivers. Configuration waivers are needed any time equipment is placed in
      aisle spaces, equipment that hinders access to emergency equipment/oxygen, aircraft seats installed
      facing aft, cargo barrier nets/environmental curtain not installed in correct position, and the cargo han-
      dling system used not as designed (i.e. moving rails, latch pawls, etc.). This list is not comprehensive.
      Anytime a piece of equipment is installed in a place it was not designed for, or if it will hinder evacu-
      ation of the aircraft, a waiver is required. The addition of equipment that is not listed in DD365-1,
      Basic Weight Checklist Record, Chart A, that has not been tested or certified for use in the KC-10
      also constitutes a nonstandard configuration. Coordinate through TACC for the waiver. HQ AMC/
      A37VK will coordinate through the KC-10 System Program Office (SPO) for concurrence and
      approval.

   13.14.9. Flight Test Data Acquisition System Pallet. The KC-10 palletized flight test data acquisition
   system does not require a configuration wavier when loaded using TO 1C-10(K)A-9 criteria. Use the
   empty placarded weight of 1700 lbs.

13.15. Human Remains. Transport human remains on the KC-10 aircraft IAW AMCI 24-101 Vol II,
Cargo and Mail, and AMCI 11-208 guidance.

                                                  Chapter 14

                                              FUEL PLANNING

14.1. General. This chapter outlines KC-10 fuel planning factors. It is designed to assist pilots, flight
engineers, and planners in planning for KC-10 missions.

14.2. Fuel Requirements. This section implements AFI 11-202V3 fuel requirements.
      14.2.1. Required Ramp Fuel. Required ramp fuel will consist of all fuel required for engine start, taxi,
      APU operation, takeoff, enroute, enroute reserve, air refueling, decompression, descent, approach and
      landing, alternate, transition, holding/minimum landing.
      14.2.2. Start Engines, Taxi, and APU operation. Normally 1500 pounds. When anticipating more
      than 15 minutes ground operation time, add 100 pounds for each minute in excess of 15 minutes, not
      to exceed 3000 pounds. If extended APU operations are anticipated, plan 350 pph.
      14.2.3. Takeoff. Fuel used from the start of takeoff roll (brake release) to the start of climb (2000
      feet). Normally 2.5 minutes and 2500 pounds.
      14.2.4. Enroute. Fuel from start of climb segment at the departure location to Begin Descent Point at
      destination.
      14.2.5. Enroute Reserve. 10% of the flight time fuel over the Category 1 route/route segment, not to
      exceed 1+00 fuel at normal cruise. This is designated on the Computer Flight Plan (CFP) by the
      ampersand symbol (&). A Cat 1 route is any route on which the position of the aircraft cannot be accu-
      rately determined by the overhead crossing of a radio aid at least once each hour with positive course
      guidance between such radio aids.
      14.2.6. Air Refueling. Scheduled offload minus scheduled onload. If scheduled onloads are not com-
      pleted it may be impossible to complete the mission.
      14.2.7. Identified Extra. Fuel which may be added for unplanned contingencies such as late receivers,
      increased offloads, ATC delays, unplanned holding, weather avoidance, etc. This value should not
      normally exceed 10,000 pounds. Additionally, this block may include transition fuel at destination
      minus alternate and approach and landing fuel, or tankered fuel for subsequent sorties. If subsequent
      sortie is a NERCC, the first sortie’s holding fuel may be subtracted from the tankered fuel.
      14.2.8. Decompression Fuel. Additional fuel may be needed to satisfy oxygen requirements. For
      flights where the total number of individuals on board the aircraft exceeds the total number of opera-
      tional flight crew oxygen system stations, ensure there is sufficient fuel on board to allow for a loss of
      cabin pressurization from any point along the route, an emergency descent to 10,000 feet MSL mini-
      mum, and continued flight to the nearest suitable emergency airfield. To compute decompression fuel,
      examine the intended route of flight and determine the point furthest from a suitable emergency air-
      field. From the flight plan determine the amount of fuel remaining on board the aircraft at that point.
      Compare that fuel remaining value with the amount of fuel that would be required to proceed from
      that furthest point, at 10,000 ft, to the suitable emergency airfield, execute a descent, approach and
      landing, and land with 12,000 pounds.
      14.2.9. Descents. Descents are not normally calculated separately, but are included in approach and
      landing fuel. If calculated separately, fuel from Begin Descent Point to Initial Approach Fix.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                167


   14.2.10. Approach and Landing. Fuel from Begin Descent Point to landing. Use 3000 pounds if cal-
   culated separately from descent fuel.
   14.2.11. Alternate. Fuel for missed approach and flight from intended destination to alternate aero-
   drome. Use Time and Fuel to Alternate, or Specific Range charts.
       14.2.11.1. When holding is required in lieu of an alternate at a remote or island destination, carry
       an additional one hour and 15 minutes of holding fuel. A remote or island destination is defined as
       any aerodrome which, due to its unique geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or
       military) within 2 hours flying time. Use the Three-Engine Holding table with a 25-degree bank
       angle, planned destination gross weight, FL 200.
   14.2.12. Transition. Fuel for transition training at the destination. Compute at 18,000 pounds per
   hour. This includes fuel for the initial approach.
   14.2.13. Holding Fuel. Fuel for 45 minutes of holding, or 12,000 pounds, whichever is greater. This
   also serves as the minimum planned final landing fuel at destination or alternate. Compute using
   planned destination gross weight at 10,000 feet. Use the Three-Engine Holding Table with a
   25-degree bank angle.
       14.2.13.1. When filing to a destination where the alternate is located in Alaska, or at latitudes
       greater than 59 degrees, compute an additional 30 minutes of holding fuel for a total of one hour
       and fifteen minutes.
   14.2.14. Minimum Planned Fuel at Begin Descent Point. Consists of fuel required for descent,
   approach and landing, alternate/missed approach, and holding/minimum landing fuel. Additional fuel
   may be added to allow crews some flexibility when dealing with unplanned contingencies (e.g., late
   receivers, extra receivers, increased off loads, weather avoidance, ATC delays, etc.) This Identified
   Extra fuel should not normally exceed 10,000 pounds. When dealing with unplanned contingencies,
   crews will still plan to touchdown with minimum landing fuel. Units may develop standard alternate
   fuel requirements for local training missions however; these fuel requirements will not be less than
   those specified in this AFI.

14.3. Computer Flight Plan. Only AMC-validated computer flight planning software is approved for
use in producing CFPs. The CFP normally serves as the fuel log. AF IMT 4090 is used when no CFP is
available. It is the crew’s responsibility to review each CFP and determine if the planned values chosen by
the flight planner are sufficient and correct for the mission. The CFP fuel calculations must be verified
using T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1-1. This ensures the flight plan has been computed with the correct values. The
flight engineer does this by completing the time and fuel analysis block of the AF IMT 4091. Use Section
5 Specific Range charts or Section 10 Flight Planning Tables to verify the enroute portion. Confirming
each and every segment on the flight plan is not necessary. Every effort must be made to eliminate unnec-
essary "padding" of fuel figures.
   14.3.1. When mission requirements dictate a change to the planned mission, the fuel must be recalcu-
   lated to ensure safe completion of the flight. A pilot or flight engineer may insert the new FMS way-
   points for flight plan changes and determine new leg distances. This distance must be converted to air
   distance by applying the FMS wind factor. When the new leg air distance is known, calculate the new
   leg burn-off and update the flight plan or AF IMT 4090. It is recommended that the fuel difference be
   applied at the destination, then work the plan backwards, applying the new leg burn-offs and any air
   refueling on-loads or off-loads.

      14.3.2. Drag degradation with WARP hoses deployed and slats and flaps extended can increase fuel
      consumption by nearly 10 percent. These and any other external configuration changes (i.e. gear down
      flights), will require modifications to increase standard fuel planning numbers. Consult drag index
      chart and gear down data in the performance manual.
      14.3.3. Table 14.1. provides drag index guidance when using PFPS to produce CFPs. Refer to T.O.
      1C-10(K)A-1-1, Figure 1-14 for additional drag index information.

Table 14.1. PFPS DRAG INDEX VALUES.
CONDITION                                             DRAG INDEX
Tanker Boom Air Refueling                                   18.5
Tanker Centerline Drogue Air Refueling                      10.0
WARP (clean wing, hose and drogue retracted)                10.0
WARP (clean wing, hose and drogue extended)                 29.0
Receiver Air Refueling                                      44.0

14.4. Fuel Conservation. Fuel conservation requires everyone’s participation. For every pound of
excess fuel, 3 percent of the excess will be burned each hour. Do not carry extra fuel for convenience.
Unidentified extra fuel should not exceed RRFL by more than 10,000 pounds.
      14.4.1. Identified extra fuel may be added to RRFL:
         14.4.1.1. When fuel availability is limited or not available at en route stops.
         14.4.1.2. For known holding delays in excess of standard.
         14.4.1.3. For anticipated off course weather avoidance.
         14.4.1.4. When reliable wind data or receiver profiles are not available.
      14.4.2. Planning guidelines for fuel conservation:
         14.4.2.1. Airlift missions. Plan Long Range Cruise (LRC) and optimum altitude.
         14.4.2.2. Tanker Mission. Plan to and from the AR track or anchor at LRC and optimum altitude.
         14.4.2.3. Limit the use of the APU when possible.
         14.4.2.4. Maintain aircraft CG as far aft as practical (better than 24%).
         14.4.2.5. Raise boom and close sighting window between multiple ARCTs when practical.

                                           AIR REFUELING

15.1. General. This chapter establishes air refueling guidelines applicable to KC-10 aircraft and aircrews
and is supplemental to those prescribed by the flight manual and other applicable directives.

15.2. AR Limitations. The following limitations apply.
   15.2.1. AR altitudes. AR operations will be conducted above 12,000 feet MSL, or 10,000 feet AGL,
   whichever is higher. EXCEPTION: C-130 receivers may be refueled as low as 5,000 feet AGL, if
   mission requirements dictate.
       15.2.1.1. AR operations based at or above 12,000 feet MSL, which momentarily fall below
       10,000 feet AGL, but not lower than 5,000 feet AGL, due to over flight of mountain ridges, peaks,
       etc., are permissible.
       15.2.1.2. If refueling must be accomplished below 10,000 feet AGL, limit refueling time to the
       minimum required to meet operational requirements and then immediately recover to normal refu-
       eling altitudes. Crews must ensure thorough knowledge of terrain features when operating below
       10,000
       feet AGL and will limit operations to flat or rolling terrain, or over water. In no event will refuel-
       ing be conducted below 3,000 feet AGL.
   15.2.2. Refueling During Training Missions. AR should not be accomplished during training mis-
   sions when:
       15.2.2.1. Conditions result in marginal control of either aircraft or the boom (in the opinion of
       either the pilot or boom operator).
       15.2.2.2. Either the tanker or the receiver (except B-52) has less than the full number of engines
       operating.
       15.2.2.3. Tanker aircraft is unable to retract the landing gear.
   15.2.3. Tanker Autopilot. Tanker pilots will notify receiver pilots when any axis of the autopilot is
   not used. If the tanker copilot is required to fly autopilot-off for training, unqualified receiver pilots
   will not fly the aircraft (N/A FTU). Tanker pilots will notify the receiver when copilot autopilot-off
   training is conducted, receiver pilot must be qualified and acknowledge copilot autopilot-off training.
   15.2.4. AR Without Tanker Disconnect Capability. Without tanker disconnect capability means the
   boom operator cannot trigger an immediate disconnect using either the normal disconnect system or
   the independent disconnect system (IDS). AR (tanker or receiver) will not be conducted after a known
   loss of tanker disconnect capability.
   EXCEPTIONS: Fuel emergency situations, OPLAN 8044 missions, contingency missions, JCS alert,
   ORI or CORI, receiver over water deployment or re-deployment, operational reconnaissance mis-
   sions, prime nuclear airlift force (PNAF) support missions under normal conditions when the refuel-
   ing is essential for home base recovery, or when authorized in the mission directive.
170                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


NOTE: When conducting AR without tanker disconnect capability, limit contacts to the minimum num-
ber necessary to complete mission requirements. Do not accomplish boom limit demonstrations, or prac-
tice emergency separations while in contact.
      15.2.5. Manual Boom Latching (MBL) (also referred to as Emergency Boom Latching (EBL), Over-
      ride Boom Latching (OBL), and amplifier override). Normal tanker disconnect capability and auto-
      matic disconnect limits are inoperative. Training and evaluation in MBL procedures may only be
      accomplished under the following conditions:
         15.2.5.1. Direct IP supervision is required on board receiver aircraft (if other than fighter type).
         15.2.5.2. Limit contacts to the minimum required.
         15.2.5.3. Receiver and tanker AR systems must be fully operable.
         15.2.5.4. Do not accomplish boom limit demonstrations, or practice emergency separations while
         in contact.
NOTE: The boom operator and receiver pilot must coordinate all actions as required by applicable direc-
tives and checklists when making AR contacts during the situations listed above.
NOTE: MBL with IDS system operative may be accomplished without restrictions.
      15.2.6. Reverse Air Refueling. See T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1 and T.O. 1-1C-1-33, Flight Crew Tanker Air
      Refueling Procedures.
         15.2.6.1. Reverse AR into a KC-135 is only permitted in an emergency, for operational necessity,
         or IAW FTU syllabus training requirements.
         15.2.6.2. There are no additional restrictions for reverse AR into another KC-10.
      15.2.7. Practice Emergency Separations.
         15.2.7.1. Prior to the actual accomplishment of a practice emergency separation, coordination
         between the tanker pilot, boom operator, and receiver pilot is mandatory. Coordination must
         include information on when the separation will occur and who will give the command of execu-
         tion. Tanker pilot coordination may be accomplished over interphone with the boom operator.
         15.2.7.2. If separation is initiated from the contact position, the receiver’s AR system must be in
         normal, and a boom operator disconnect capability with the receiver must exist.
         15.2.7.3. Practice emergency separations may be accomplished with passengers on board. Ensure
         all passengers are seated with seat belts fastened.
      15.2.8. Limits Demonstration. KC-135 tanker disconnect capability must be verified by a boom oper-
      ator initiated disconnect prior to receivers conducting limits demonstrations.
      15.2.9. Receiver AR Training for Unqualified Receiver Pilots. Pilots will be certified by the Squad-
      ron Commander to conduct receiver AR training under the supervision of an AC. See AFI
      11-2KC-10V1 for certification requirements to conduct AC-supervised receiver air refueling.
      In-flight training for certification will be accomplished under direct IP supervision. The following
      procedures apply:
         15.2.9.1. The receiver pilot must inform and receive acknowledgment from the tanker.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 171


       15.2.9.2. The boom operator operating the boom controls must be qualified for the applicable cat-
       egory receiver.
NOTE: This restriction does not apply during FTU training provided the student boom operator is under
direct instructor supervision.
       15.2.9.3. If the tanker autopilot is off, the tanker copilot will not fly the aircraft.
NOTE: This restriction does not apply during FTU training provided the student receiver pilot and the
student tanker copilot are under direct IP supervision.
   15.2.10. Boom Operator Qualification or Training. Unqualified and non-current boom operators must
   be under direct instructor supervision to conduct AR operations.
   15.2.11. Operator Fatigue. If boom operator or receiver pilot fatigue becomes a factor during AR
   operations, the receiver will maintain no closer than the pre-contact position until fatigue is no longer
   a factor (operator judgment).
   15.2.12. Weather limitations.
       15.2.12.1. Terminate refueling if moderate turbulence is encountered.
       15.2.12.2. Discontinue refueling if in-flight visibility is insufficient to continue safe refueling
       operations.
   15.2.13. The normal method of boom control during refueling operations is with the automatic load
   alleviation system (ALAS) "ON." However, AR operations may be conducted with an ALAS mal-
   function or ALAS inoperative under the following conditions: Fuel emergency situations, OPLAN
   8044, contingency missions, airborne alert, ORI or SCACS, homeland defense missions, receiver over
   water deployment or re-deployment, operational reconnaissance missions, and prime nuclear airlift
   force (PNAF) support missions under normal conditions when the refueling is essential for home base
   recovery, or when authorized in the mission directive.
   15.2.14. AR with Single Rudder Failure. Under normal conditions both AR boom rudders must be
   operational. However, AR may be conducted with a single rudder under the following conditions: fuel
   emergency situations, OPLAN 8044, contingency missions, airborne alert, ORI or SCACS, homeland
   defense missions, receiver over water deployment or re-deployment, operational reconnaissance mis-
   sions, and prime nuclear airlift force (PNAF) support missions under normal conditions when the
   refueling is essential for home base recovery. NOTE: When conducting AR with a single rudder fail-
   ure, limit contacts to the minimum number necessary to complete the mission. AR training will not be
   conducted during single rudder operations.

15.3. Communications Failure. Aircraft experiencing two-way communications failure during the con-
duct of AR shall continue flight in accordance with the following procedures:
   15.3.1. Squawk code 7600 for at least 2 minutes prior to exiting the track or anchor.
   15.3.2. Receiver aircraft that have not received altitude instructions beyond the exit point shall exit
   the track or anchor at the lowest altitude specified in the clearance for the refueling portion of the of
   the flight and proceed in accordance with "Procedures for Two Way Radio Failure IFR-VFR" as set
   forth in DoD Flight Information Handbook.
172                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


      15.3.3. Tanker aircraft that have not received altitude instructions beyond the exit point shall exit the
      track or anchor at the highest altitude specified in the clearance for the refueling portion of the flight
      and proceed in accordance with "Procedures for Two Way Radio Failure IFR-VFR" set forth in DoD
      Flight Information Handbook.

15.4. Operational Reporting. Air refueling command and control reporting will be in accordance with
Chapter 2 of this instruction.

15.5. MARSA Applicability for Aerial Refueling. MARSA begins between the tanker and receiver
when the tanker advises ATC that it is accepting MARSA. MARSA is not an ICAO recognized term. If in
doubt as to what separation is provided by ATC, or what separation the aircrew is responsible for, query
the controlling agency.
      15.5.1. After MARSA has been declared, controller-assigned course or altitude changes prior to ren-
      dezvous completion will automatically void MARSA and are to be avoided.
      15.5.2. Once the rendezvous is completed, headings and altitude assignments may be made with the
      tanker concurrence with MARSA remaining in effect.
      15.5.3. Upon rendezvous completion, receiver aircraft shall remain within 3 miles of the tanker until
      MARSA is terminated.
      15.5.4. After air refueling clearance is received and until rendezvous is completed, aerial refueling
      airspace from the ARIP to the ARCP is sterilized. After rendezvous is completed and the tankers or
      receivers proceed down track, other non-participating aircraft may be cleared through the refueling
      block airspace with proper separation.
      15.5.5. MARSA ends between the tanker and receiver when the tanker advises ATC that the tanker
      and receiver aircraft are vertically positioned within the air refueling airspace and ATC advises
      MARSA is terminated.

15.6. Altitude Reservation (ALTRV). An ALTRV is authorization by a central altitude reservation
function (CARF, EUCARF, PACMARF, CARU) or the appropriate ARTCC/CERAP under certain cir-
cumstances, for airspace utilization under prescribed conditions. Air refueling on operational missions
often utilizes an ALTRV under these conditions. ALTRVs may include all, a portion, or portions of the
intended route of flight. Request and approval format can be found in FAA 7610.4K.
      15.6.1. Ensure ALTRV approval is received prior to mission execution. ALTRV status may be veri-
      fied through the appropriate TACC cell.
      15.6.2. Aircraft must depart within the assigned AVANA (ALTRV Void if Aircraft Not Airborne)
      time for the purpose of providing separation between altitude reservations. Normal AVANA will be 1
      hour. If a mission is to be delayed beyond the AVANA time, coordinate with the C2 authority as soon
      as possible. Rescheduling will normally be in 24-hour increments after the original schedule.
      15.6.3. Aircraft on an ALTRV must operate within the altitude, time, and areas specified in the
      approval. An ALTRV APVL authorizes the aircraft to climb or descend as specified. Controllers are
      not required to issue a climb or descent clearance for the various flight segments. They may, however,
      request that the pilot advise them prior to initiating an altitude change.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 173


   15.6.4. In a non-radar environment, the aircraft shall advise ATC if actual fix timing will be more
   than plus or minus 5 minutes from the planned ALTRV en route fix estimate.
   15.6.5. File flight plans (1801 or DD175) containing ALTRVs IAW FLIP GP. Include the name of
   the ALTRV in the remarks section of the flight plan. ALTRV requests or approvals do not eliminate
   the responsibility to obtain proper diplomatic clearance or file flight plans.

15.7. Receiver Pilot Responsibilities. Receiver pilots are responsible for:
   15.7.1. Squawking normal when separation from the tanker is greater than 3 miles.
   15.7.2. Maintaining two-way radio contact with ATC until cleared to the AR block altitude, estab-
   lished in that block, and cleared to the AR frequency by ATC.
   15.7.3. Pilots are reminded that oceanic clearances and an acknowledged readback are required for all
   flights within North Atlantic (NAT) controlled airspace. References for oceanic clearance procedures
   are FLIP Area Planning (AP)/2 and the NAT Minimum Navigation Performance Specification
   (MNPS) Manual.
       15.7.3.1. Receiver pilots will not rely on the tanker to obtain and readback oceanic clearance. To
       the maximum extent possible, receiver pilots should obtain their own, individual clearance from
       the oceanic control authority of the airspace in which they intend to operate, prior to entering oce-
       anic airspace. Pilots will request oceanic clearance prior to oceanic entry point IAW procedures
       established in AP/2 and NAT MNPS Manual. Consider obtaining clearance and providing read-
       back prior to rendezvous and air refueling.
       15.7.3.2. Tanker aircraft will not accomplish clearance readback for receiver aircraft. Receiver
       ACs are responsible for ensuring that oceanic clearance is always readback to the controlling
       authority by a member of their crew, and acknowledged by the oceanic controlling authority, prior
       to entering oceanic airspace.

15.8. Tanker Pilot Responsibilities. Tanker pilots are responsible for:
   15.8.1. Remaining within the protected lateral, longitudinal, and vertical airspace of the refueling
   track or anchor including orbit patterns.
   15.8.2. Notifying the appropriate ATC facility of all altitudes vacated and not anticipated for further
   use by refueling aircraft. Such altitudes shall not be reoccupied without further ATC clearance.
   15.8.3. Receiver navigation, regardless of the number of tankers or receivers, after rendezvous com-
   pletion through completion of refueling operations (AR and MARSA have been terminated) except
   when under control responsibility of a military radar facility while in an anchor area.
   15.8.4. Maintaining communications with the appropriate ATC facility. All communications during
   refueling operations, including those concerning the receivers, shall be between the ATC facility or
   military radar unit and tanker. To the extent practical, receivers shall establish communications with
   the tanker prior to or when departing the ARIP on the specified AR frequency. The tanker shall
   assume position reporting responsibility for the receivers upon rendezvous completion.
   15.8.5. Coordinating altitude and route clearance:
       15.8.5.1. From the ATC facility for receivers and tanker at least 5 minutes prior to refueling com-
       pletion except when both aircraft are operating on an approved altitude reservation (ALTRV).
174                                                     AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


         15.8.5.2. Through the radar controller when operating in refueling anchors with military ground
         radar. At least 5 minutes prior to completing refueling operations, the military radar facility shall
         forward requests to the assigned ATC facility and subsequently relay ATC clearances for the
         tanker and receiver aircraft from the ATC facility.
         15.8.5.3. Tanker aircrews should not normally obtain oceanic clearances for receiver aircraft
         intending to operate in NAT oceanic airspace. This is a receiver AC responsibility.
         15.8.5.4. Tanker aircrews will not readback receiver aircraft oceanic clearance. This is a receiver
         AC responsibility.
      15.8.6. Vertically positioning aircraft prior to reaching the planned exit point, to facilitate the safe
      and efficient transfer of separation responsibility from the military, under the provisions of MARSA,
      to the ATC facility on completion of refueling operations. Vertical separation of receivers and tankers
      shall be accomplished within the assigned altitudes.
      15.8.7. Providing each receiver, upon request, with the aircraft's position at the completion of refuel-
      ing operations. Additional information concerning amendments or changes to the receiver's ATC
      clearance shall also be provided as appropriate.
      15.8.8. Coordinating all refueling formation operations to ensure all aircraft are in proper post air
      refueling formation prior to cell breakup. Prior to terminating air refueling, the lead tanker will con-
      firm all aircraft in the formation are in proper post air refueling position with required lateral/vertical
      separation.
      15.8.9. Accomplishing Search and Rescue (SAR) procedures IAW AFI 11-207. In an emergency, the
      flight leader immediately notifies the tanker commander. The tanker aircrew notifies ATC. In the
      event of a downed or ditched receiver, ATC notifies the Rescue Coordination Center, which in turn
      alerts the nearest SAR assets. The tanker provides cover as long as fuel reserves allow. Remaining
      receivers proceed unescorted to the nearest abort base or continue the mission with remaining tankers.

15.9. ATC Clearance. AR operations are normally conducted on tracks or anchor areas published in
DOD FLIP. Operational considerations may require AR outside published areas or within an ALTRV.
The tanker aircraft commander shall receive specific ATC clearance from the appropriate ATC facility for
the following:
      15.9.1. Entry to/exit from assigned aerial refueling altitude block (except on an approved ALTRV).
      15.9.2. Altitudes requested for tanker and receiver aircraft upon completion of air refueling.
      15.9.3. Routing for each aircraft or formation flight when exiting the refueling track prior to or
      beyond the exit point, or different from the flight plan routing.
      15.9.4. Extending the refueling operations beyond the track or anchor exit point due to adverse
      winds, mission requirements, etc.
      15.9.5. Use of altitudes in excess of those for which specific clearance has been granted (i.e., tobog-
      ganing).
NOTE: Protected airspace for AR tracks is defined in FAA order 7610.4J SPECIAL MILITARY OPER-
ATIONS, available at: http://www.FAA.gov/atpubs/mil/index.htm#order. If tankers need to exceed
these bounds to accomplish the rendezvous, they must request clearance from ATC prior to exiting the
protected orbit pattern airspace.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                   175


15.10. Emergency AR. When an emergency AR requirement arises, units tasked will attempt to fill the
requirement from available unit resources. Use unit training sorties as first priority and generated alert
sorties as second priority. If no capability exists, notify the controlling agency of the requirement and unit
shortfall. The following procedures apply:
   15.10.1. Units will not routinely preposition additional aircraft to satisfy potential emergency AR
   requirements.
   15.10.2. Time permitting, coordinate emergency AR requirements with receiver parent MAJCOM or
   NAF.
   15.10.3. The unit command post should coordinate or direct unit actions.
   15.10.4. Identify unit sortie when notified of emergency air refueling requirement.
   15.10.5. Coordinate with the OG/CC.
   15.10.6. Notify TACC of requirement and proposed actions.
   15.10.7. Notify squadron or aircrew of requirement. Provide ARCT, rendezvous information, alti-
   tude, receiver call sign, and communication plan.
   15.10.8. Advise receiver of planned actions.
   15.10.9. Notify the ARTCC liaison of requirement.

15.11. Air-to-Air Refueling with Foreign Aircraft. When conducting exercises or contingency opera-
tions with tankers or receivers of foreign nations, crews will review/understand ATP-56, Air to Air Refu-
eling manual and ensure compliance. ATP-56 serves as the source document for air refueling information
among participating countries and is no longer limited to NATO countries only.
   15.11.1. Tankers will only refuel those aircraft listed in applicable air refueling flight manuals or spe-
   cifically authorized by HQ AMC/A37V. Receiver aircraft not previously certified for refueling oper-
   ations (includes foreign variants of US produced aircraft) must be certified for technical and
   operational compatibility in accordance with USAF regulations prior to refueling.
   15.11.2. AR of foreign aircraft must be tasked by proper C2 authority. Opportune AR of foreign air-
   craft is prohibited.

15.12. Coronet East Mission Over Flights in France. Aircrews must explicitly follow pre-coordinated
mission profiles on missions that transit French airspace. Although ALTRVs are not formally recognized
in the French ATC system, pre-coordinated Coronet East Missions are afforded a certain degree of addi-
tional protection while in French airspace. In exchange for this special handling, it is absolutely essential
that aircrews adhere to pre-coordinated routes and altitudes to avoid problems (including the portion of
the flight to/from the ALTRV). Failure to do so creates difficult diplomatic situations and jeopardizes
future authorization for US Military over flights of France. Aircrews will not request any maneuvers that
have not been coordinated in advance with French ATC. Examples of these maneuvers include formation
split up and rejoin (unless pre-coordinated). During the portion of the flight to/from the ALTRV, tanker
and receivers must remain in formation at a single altitude while in French airspace. If a request (even if
pre-coordinated) is denied by the controller, follow their instructions.

                                                    Chapter 16

                                           MISSION PLANNING

16.1. General. This chapter standardizes procedures for planning, briefing, and reviewing all missions.
Mission planning is normally conducted the day prior for CONUS missions, and two days prior for OCO-
NUS missions. OG/CC may elect to use a Same Day Mission Plan option. The PIC is ultimately respon-
sible for the accuracy of the mission materials. Unit mission planning facilities should possess essential
mission planning material. Additional guidance can be found in AFTTP 3-3.22A.

16.2. Mission Planning.
      16.2.1. Operational Missions. Staff planners should prepare detailed master flight plans meeting the
      requirements of the OPORD/Tasking. Flight plans based on a "planning forecast" should be reviewed
      before the mission is flown, using an "operational forecast."
         16.2.1.1. As a minimum, prepare the following items as they apply to the mission:
             16.2.1.1.1. Flight Plans, Maps, Charts, and Applicable Forms.
             16.2.1.1.2. Copies of OPORD/Tasking.
             16.2.1.1.3. Communication and EMCON requirements.
             16.2.1.1.4. Air refueling data.
             16.2.1.1.5. Tactics and procedures to be employed.
         16.2.1.2. The preparing staff agency should provide complete and accurate data. Packages should
         be annotated to include who prepared the package.
      16.2.2. Contingency Missions. The theater air and space operations center (AOC) will publish an
      operations order (OPORD), air tasking order (ATO), airspace coordination order (ACO), and/or frag-
      mentary order (FRAG), to establish mission objectives. ATO contents are discussed in AFTTP 3-1.
         16.2.2.1. OPORD. An OPORD usually covers overall concepts of operations and mission
         requirements to be flown during a future time period (such as a week or more).
         16.2.2.2. ATO. An ATO may be issued daily to supplement the OPORD and avoid repetition. An
         ATO will task elements of composite forces, provide mission objectives and general guidance,
         and indicate actions required by individual situations. ATOs are normally accompanied by special
         instructions (SPINS) which provide detailed instructions for composite forces. A standardized
         ATO format for theater assigned forces can be found in AFP 102-2 Volume 1, Joint Users Hand-
         book—US Message Text Format (JUH-USMTF), Air Tasking Order/Confirmation (ATOCONF),
         and AFTTP 3-1Volume 1. Airspace control procedures may be implemented in the ATO, SPINS,
         or published in a separate Airspace Coordination Order (ACO). Planners and aircrew will under-
         stand and comply with all aspects of current airspace control procedures. The following items can
         be extracted from the ATO:
             16.2.2.2.1. Mission number.
             16.2.2.2.2. Security classification.
             16.2.2.2.3. Tasking organization.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 177


           16.2.2.2.4. Concept of operations and mission description to include type of mission, assigned
           air refueling areas, type and number of receivers, required offload, required aircraft and air-
           crews, and participating forces and units.
           16.2.2.2.5. Schedule of events.
           16.2.2.2.6. Rules of engagement (ROE).
           16.2.2.2.7. Communications & Electronic Operating Instructions (CEOI).
           16.2.2.2.8. Special Instructions (SPINS).
           16.2.2.2.9. Command and control instructions.
           16.2.2.2.10. Airspace management procedures, to include IFF/squawks, airspace control cen-
           ter coordination, air defense network procedures, prohibited/restricted area procedures, and
           route deconfliction.
       16.2.2.3. Intelligence Requirements. Current intelligence is vital. Incomplete or outdated infor-
       mation reduces the probability of success and survivability. Intelligence personnel will be inte-
       grated into the planning cell. They can prepare a reference chart depicting current orders of battle
       (OB), significant intelligence/threat information, and air refueling tracks or anchor areas. They
       predict enemy radar detection capabilities, and obtain imagery of en route or objective area refer-
       ence points (imagery will be requested early to ensure availability). Targeting specialists can pro-
       vide radar predictions and target analysis when required.
           16.2.2.3.1. Threat Engagement. AFTTP 3-1V2, provides classified threat system information.
           If a mission is likely to encounter a hostile air defense environment, evaluate threat capabili-
           ties and limitations with intelligence personnel.
           16.2.2.3.2. Evasion Plan of Action (EPA). Aircrews and/or planners with the assistance of
           intelligence personnel and life support/survival specialists will develop an EPA. An evasion
           plan may be included in the OPORD or SPINS. AFTTP 3-1 includes suggested EPA planning
           information.
       16.2.2.4. As a minimum, mission planners should provide aircrews with items specified in para-
       graph 16.2.1.
   16.2.3. Training Missions. Unit staff will determine who plans the mission.

16.3. Agency Briefing (if applicable). The mission briefing presented by the mission planners will nor-
mally be conducted no earlier than three days before the mission. The purpose of the mission briefing is
to acquaint all crew members with the general aspects of the mission. The group or squadron commander,
combat support group staff specialists, all crew members of each participating crew, and other personnel
concerned with the mission should attend. The mission briefing may include all information pertinent to
the mission and eliminate the need for later specialized briefings. In cases where highly specialized infor-
mation or techniques require additional explanation or review (such as formation procedures), schedule a
specialized briefing. During the briefing, indicate what preparation has been accomplished and what is yet
to be accomplished. Use the following as a guide in conducting a briefing:
   16.3.1. Security classification and roll call for the briefing and mission.
178                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


      16.3.2. Purpose of the mission, forces required (to include number of aircraft) and a statement of mis-
      sion requirements in sufficient detail to ensure all crew members understand all the information.
      16.3.3. Mission Requirements:
         16.3.3.1. Crew composition.
         16.3.3.2. Crew alerting and reporting.
         16.3.3.3. Minimum ground times.
         16.3.3.4. Crew duty times.
         16.3.3.5. Command waivers.
         16.3.3.6. Rules of engagement (ROE).
         16.3.3.7. EMCON level directed for each phase of flight.
      16.3.4. Intelligence information.
      16.3.5. Weather information.
      16.3.6. Timing and control times to include:
         16.3.6.1. Start times, taxi, and takeoff.
         16.3.6.2. ARCT to include area and point for all refueling.
         16.3.6.3. Landing time.
      16.3.7. Review taxi, takeoff, and departure plans to include communications requirements and fre-
      quencies.
      16.3.8. Navigation and altitude reservation flight plan.
      16.3.9. Air refueling information and procedures.
      16.3.10. Threat, special mission tactics.
      16.3.11. Cargo load information.
      16.3.12. Recall and diversion procedures.
      16.3.13. Recovery and alternate base.
      16.3.14. Announcements to include technical order status and changes, flying safety, specialized
      briefing times and locations, debriefing and interrogation location and procedures, messing, transpor-
      tation, personal equipment, radio, and communications procedures and crew questions.

16.4. Crew Mission Study and Detailed Flight Planning. Mission study is intended to acquaint air-
crews with the mission and individual sortie requirements to ensure successful mission accomplishment.
Wing and squadron staff should monitor crew activity and be able to resolve problem areas. Unit staff
should allocate a minimum of 4 hours to accomplish mission planning and mission briefing. This period
may be reduced in proportion to the amount of staff and computer prepared mission data available to the
crew. However, in no case will mission planning be reduced to less than 1.5 hours. Mission planning
should be accomplished as a crew. Unit staff should ensure that other activities do not interfere with mis-
sion planning and aircrew mission briefing. In cases where crews plan to brief and fly several missions,
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                179


from various bases, in a short period of time, the PIC will ensure the crew has sufficient time for mission
planning.

16.5. Pilot in Command Briefing. (See Chapter 6 of this AFI) Conduct after each individual crew-
member has completed their mission preparation. All crew members will be present unless excused by the
PIC. Crew members not present must be briefed by the PIC prior to takeoff. The PIC must re-brief the
mission when the time interval from initial aircrew briefing to mission takeoff exceeds 72 hours.

16.6. Post Mission Debriefing. Held immediately after the mission, if practical. PICs should contact the
intelligence branch representative when hostile or suspect activity is encountered. Aircrews should attend
the operations and maintenance de-briefings as directed by unit commander. Maintenance de-brief should
be conducted as soon as possible after flight. A crew critique should be conducted by the PIC with the
entire crew present. For formation flights, a post mission critique should be conducted by the formation
leader.

                                        EMPLOYMENT TRAINING

NOTE: Certain technical information was intentionally omitted or generalized to keep this chapter
unclassified. Users should be aware that written additions to any portion of this document could cause the
manual to become classified.

17.1. General. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.22A for additional guidance on tactics training, specific maneuver
descriptions, and tactical maneuver procedures. AFTTP 3-3.22A, Chapter 12, Proficiency Exercises,
details the tactics maneuvers required for tactics certification. All crewmembers must complete tactics
certification IAW AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume 1. Each unit will have a tactics training program tailored to the
unit’s wartime tasking. Tactics and intelligence staff should join forces in this area to ensure success.

17.2. Responsibilities. The tactics training program is a coordinated effort between the unit intelligence
office, wing/group training office, and wing/group weapons and tactics flight, in order to ensure continu-
ity and the unit’s specific mission tasking is addressed.
      17.2.1. Tactics Reference Library and Tactics Read File . The unit tactics officer is responsible for
      developing procedures for timely dissemination of tactical information to unit aircrew members. See
      AMCI 11-207, AMC Weapons and Tactics Program, for the Tactics Reference Library.

17.3. Tactics Simulator Training.
      17.3.1. Scope. Aircrews should practice all applicable tactical maneuvers in the simulator prior to
      attempting the maneuvers in-flight. Units may attempt any maneuver in the simulator.
NOTE: Use the simulator for tactics reinforcement. The simulator provides an inexpensive reinforce-
ment and safe means of practicing tactics. Units should tailor the simulator to their specific tasking.
      17.3.2. Responsibilities. The tactics simulator training is directed by the wing/group weapons and
      tactics flight. Suggestions for tactics simulator profiles must be forwarded for approval to DET 1,
      AMCAOS, prior to incorporating the profile into refresher simulator periods. Because no threat spe-
      cific information is required for this training, the simulator training is unclassified. Classified tactics
      simulator profiles are under development at various units and are encouraged. Tactics training should
      be incorporated into refresher training profiles to ensure all crew members accomplish the training.
      However, this does not preclude using Additional Training Time (ATT) simulators for tactics train-
      ing. The following are suggestions for tactics profiles to be practiced in the simulator:
         17.3.2.1. Slide/scram training maneuvers accomplished from orbit speeds and refueling speeds.
         17.3.2.2. Full crew simulators. The boom operator rides in the simulator with the pilot team and
         flight engineer to enhance crew coordination, aircrew survival and overcome system degrades.
         17.3.2.3. Tactical arrivals and departures training.
         17.3.2.4. Defending climbs and combat descents accomplished from air refueling activities.

17.4. Tactics Flight Training.
   17.4.1. Scope. The tactics flight training program is designed to provide KC-10 crew members with
   the training necessary to confidently and successfully survive the wartime threat environment without
   endangering aircrews or aircraft in peacetime. This chapter, in conjunction with AFTTP 3-3.22A,
   details those maneuvers applicable to the KC-10 community; however, do not attempt any maneuver
   that is not specifically mentioned in this publication, or AFTTP 3-3.22A, without HQ AMC/A3
   approval.
       17.4.1.1. Tactical Maneuvers. See AFTTP 3-3.22A for a description of advantages, disadvan-
       tages, recommended techniques, and flight parameters, for each maneuver. Attain simulator profi-
       ciency before accomplishing tactical maneuvers in flight. Once certified to accomplish tactical
       maneuvers, aircraft commanders and above do not require direct instructor pilot supervision when
       accomplishing tactical maneuvers for continuation training. Accomplish tactics initial certifica-
       tion training on any sortie without passengers aboard. Once certified, tactical maneuvers may be
       flown on continuation training and operational missions with passengers on board. Notify passen-
       gers prior to conducting tactics maneuvers training.
   17.4.2. Objectives. Flight training is the final phase of the tactics program. Its goal is to combine the
   information presented from the ground and simulator phases and provides actual application of the
   tactics training concepts. Accomplish all flight maneuvers with strict adherence to aircraft limitations
   as defined in KC-10 tech orders and this AFI.
   17.4.3. Flight Training Limitations and Restrictions:
       17.4.3.1. Limitations. The following limitations apply to all in-flight tactics training. Events
       accomplished in the simulator may be accomplished IAW AFTTP 3-3.22A without restriction.
       Refer to Table 17.1. to determine which maneuvers are permitted in the aircraft.
          17.4.3.1.1. Aircraft tactical arrival and departure (TAD) training is limited to single-ship,
          VMC, 30 degree angle of bank maximum, and 1000’ AGL minimum ingress/egress altitudes.
          17.4.3.1.2. Aircraft scram training is limited to VMC, 45 degree angle of bank maximum,
          10,000’ AGL minimum altitude, and 400,000 pound maximum gross weight. Scatter turns are
          limited to two-ship formations.
          17.4.3.1.3. Limit formation in-place turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank and 90
          degrees of turn.
          17.4.3.1.4. Use a maximum of CLIMB power on the thrust rating computer when accomplish-
          ing scram and defending climb training in the aircraft.

NOTE:
                 1. In response to a simulated fighter attack, single tanker maneuvers will be limited by air
                    work parameters specified in applicable training instructions, this AFI, and AFTTP
                    3-3.22A. Tanker formation limit maneuvering to formation slides/scrams described in
                    AFTTP 3-3.22A. Limitations from AFI 11-214 and approval waivers apply.
       17.4.3.2. Restrictions/Procedures.
          17.4.3.2.1. Intercept Training.
                 17.4.3.2.1.1. All participants conduct face-to-face coordination on specific aircraft
                 maneuvering categories, range safety requirements, and fighter engagement parameters
                 prior to flight if possible.
                 17.4.3.2.1.2. If tankers are engaged during the mission, face-to-face debriefings with the
                 intercepting fighter pilot will be accomplished if collocated.
                 17.4.3.2.1.3. Accomplish training within special use or ATC sanitized airspace (MOA,
                 restricted area, warning area, ATCAA, etc.). In addition to safety, the primary responsibil-
                 ity of the aircrew is avoiding spill-outs.
                 17.4.3.2.1.4. Tanker aircrews check-in with the appropriate controlling agency (AWACS/
                 GCI), including missions using EMCON 3. All participating aircraft monitor UHF guard
                 (243.0 MHz).
                 17.4.3.2.1.5. Jamming should not be conducted on guard or any other pre-designated fre-
                 quency.
                 17.4.3.2.1.6. Tanker aircraft should be in the unlimited maneuver category for air-to-air
                 training, which is described as no restrictions except those stated in the flight manual and
                 this AFI. Tanker aircrews must be aware of their own personal flying skills and limitations
                 when determining the level of tactical maneuvers employed. The limiting factor is not
                 always aircraft limits.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 183


              17.4.3.2.1.7. Limit extension, separation, and retrograde maneuver accomplished by a
              180-degree or less level turn, to 30 degrees of bank when in formation.
              17.4.3.2.1.8. Fighters intercepting without operative radar should make day VMC stern
              attacks only.
              17.4.3.2.1.9. Tankers may terminate an intercept with a radio call of "knock-it-off,
              knock-it-off, knock-it-off" or "terminate, terminate, terminate." Use the phrase
              "knock-it-off" only when safety of flight is a factor. It directs all aircraft to cease maneu-
              vering. The "terminate" call will end the local engagement and a "knock-it-off" call will
              end the entire exercise. Tanker crews should follow the "terminate" call with their tactical
              call sign and aircraft type to preclude mistaken identities from impacting the whole exer-
              cise (i.e. Terminate, Terminate, Terminate, Gator 41, KC-10).
              17.4.3.2.1.10. Fighter aircraft maintains at least 1,000 feet vertical separation from tank-
              ers unless at least one of the following applies: (1) Separation from tanker is greater than
              10 miles. (2) Tanker is closer than 10 miles but not a factor (i.e. collision potential) based
              on situation awareness. (3) Visual contact is established.
              17.4.3.2.1.11. Minimum range during intercepts of AMC tanker aircraft is 1000 feet or the
              MAJCOM or service minimums of the attacking fighter, whichever is greater.

17.5. Exercises.
   17.5.1. Scope. Exercises provide realistic combat-scenario training. This training is representative of
   the unit mission tasking. Unit planner ensures exercises are planned and flown to maximize tanker
   training objectives.
   17.5.2. Objectives. Tanker tactics training will be built into each exercise during the planning stage.
   Training objectives include but are not limited to, large formation refueling, AWACS interface,
   HVAA, tactical deception, threat advisories, and defensive tactics. Consider the following elements
   during exercise planning: utilize warning, alerting, deployment and execution orders. Theater ATOs
   should be sent secure by STU III and FAX at least one day during the exercise. A sortie rate of no less
   than 1.0 is the goal for Combat Reach Deployments. Employ minimum communications deployment
   package or consider requesting combat communications element. Conventional exercises should
   stress the "ability to survive and operate" (ATSO) in a chemical environment as much as possible
   within the constraints of equipment, budget, and supplies.
   17.5.3. Red/Green/Maple Flag. Through a joint effort to enhance tanker training at Flag exercises,
   selected crews attend the mass mission briefings and debriefings at Nellis AFB NV. The tanker task
   force (TTF) commander will ensure a tanker staff or aircrew member attends the PACKAGE COM-
   MANDER meetings to ensure specific tanker ATO requirements are addressed.
   17.5.4. USAF Weapons School, Mission Employment (ME) Phase. Tanker participation at ME is
   managed by the AMWC/WCOX. A superior working knowledge of tactics concepts significantly
   enhances aircrew performance during the intense training of the ME phase.
       17.5.4.1. ME Phase Tanker Objectives. Develop an understanding of the capabilities of other
       composite force aircraft in order to effectively integrate tanker support into a sound tactical game
       plan. Apply knowledge of the threat to maximize survivability of friendly aircraft. Demonstrate
       proficiency in operating Have Quick and KY-58 secure radios. Exercise contingency tactical

         game plans to avoid threats. Tanker retrograde is the primary contingency plan. Stress situational
         awareness. Exercise EMCON game plans to deny information to the enemy. Exercise de-conflic-
         tion plans to ensure safe marshaling of aircraft.
         17.5.4.2. Unit Requirements. The ME phase represents graduate-level training. The crews
         selected to participate in this exercise should be prepared for a challenging, dynamic tactics envi-
         ronment. Units will:
             17.5.4.2.1. Deploy crews with at least one member a Tactics School Graduate. This provides
             the crew with a knowledgeable point of contact and helps facilitate greater involvement in the
             tactics arena.
             17.5.4.2.2. Deploy a tactics officer as staff personnel with the crews selected to participate in
             the exercise. The tactics officer will augment the AMWC staff supporting ME phase. The tac-
             tics officer acquires practical experience in composite force operations.
      17.5.5. COPE THUNDER Exercises. COPE THUNDER is a PACAF composite force exercise flown
      from Eielson AFB. The AMWC may provide tactics instructors to deploy along with the tanker unit
      supporting COPE THUNDER. The tanker unit provides a detachment commander (DETCO) and
      senior maintenance supervisor. Tanker training objectives are identical to employment phase tanker
      objectives.
      17.5.6. Tactics After-Action Reports (TAARs). Units prepare exercise after action reports for RED,
      GREEN, and MAPLE Flags; COMBAT REACH; Fighter Weapons School (FWS) employment
      phase; COPE THUNDER; and other deployments. Submit this report to HQ AMC/A39T in message
      form not later than 30 calendar days after mission completion. See AMCI 11-207 for additional details
      on the TAAR format and appropriate addresses for dissemination of information into the Joint Les-
      sons Learned Program (JLLP).
         17.5.6.1. Deployments supported by multiple units. The lead unit will submit the report for the
         exercise.

                                      AIRCRAFT FORMATION

18.1. General. This chapter covers basic formation procedures and operations. All procedures described
apply to all KC-10 and KC-135 aircraft. The broad term formation as used does not differentiate between
specific tactics of en route formation or visual formation. Specific references to each tactic must be made
to ensure complete understanding.
   18.1.1. All formation flights will be planned, briefed, and critiqued in accordance with the applicable
   A/R manual, this chapter, and AFTTP 3-3.22A.
   18.1.2. These procedures are standardized with KC-135 formation operations.

18.2. Specified Times. The formation leader determines the sequence of events and mission times based
on mission requirements. Local SOEs for formation training missions may be established for use at home
station. Changes in briefing or mission timing will be relayed to all formation members at the earliest
opportunity.

18.3. Weather Minimums. Comply with weather minimums for takeoff and landing established in AFI
11-202V3 and Chapter 6 of this instruction.

18.4. Ground Operations. The formation leader should accomplish radio checks and copy ATC clear-
ance in the chocks. All formation members should make every effort to accomplish HAVE QUICK and
SECURE VOICE radio operations on all local formation training missions. All participating crews will
accomplish as much of the pre-takeoff checklists as possible prior to taxi. Lead will obtain taxi and take-
off clearance.

18.5. Communications and Radio Procedures. Radio and interphone discipline are critical factors in
maintaining formation integrity. The formation leader will ensure all formation members have a complete
understanding of the radio monitoring plan.
   18.5.1. Formation will not be flown on training sorties without inter-plane voice communications
   capability.
   18.5.2. When radio silent operations are required, the formation leader will pre-brief all formation
   members on specific procedures for frequency changes (i.e. timing, visual signals, etc.).
   18.5.3. Visual signals may be used as an alternate or secondary means of communication between
   aircraft.
   18.5.4. The flight lead will initiate all frequency changes. Wingmen should acknowledge in order and
   wait for every flight member to acknowledge before changing frequencies. Lead will allow enough
   time for frequency change to be accomplished before initiating check-in. Lead must ensure all flight
   members are on frequency before initiating any action or making any radio calls to ARTCC, etc. If a
   flight member does not respond, a secondary radio or guard may be used to direct the wingman to the
   proper frequency. Specific procedures should be pre-briefed by the flight lead. Crews should maintain
   non-primary radios during silent operations; however, planned frequency changes may be performed
   on briefed timing or visual signals. All flight members must be on a common frequency.
186                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


18.6. Launch, Departure, and Level-Off.
      18.6.1. Formation Briefing. The formation leader will conduct a detailed briefing for all crew mem-
      bers covering the planned activities, procedures, techniques, specific EMCON procedures, and divi-
      sion of formation responsibilities. PICs may excuse crew members from the formation briefing to
      perform preflight duties, however the PIC will back brief all appropriate items. If lead changes are
      planned, each formation lead will brief their portion of the mission. The recommended formation
      briefing guide (Attachment 4) should be used to conduct the briefing. As a minimum, the briefing
      must include all applicable items listed in the guide. The formation leader will ensure all crew mem-
      bers thoroughly understand their responsibilities, to include assumption of formation leadership.
         18.6.1.1. When deviations from the briefed mission are necessary, they will be directed by the
         leader. No actions will be taken until they have been coordinated with and are understood by all
         formation members.
         18.6.1.2. Non-collocated Units. If aircraft depart from separate bases and then rendezvous for for-
         mation activity, the formation leader should make every effort to conduct a telephone briefing
         with joining tanker and receiver formation leaders. If this is not possible, after detailed sortie
         study, the coordination and briefing between the appropriate lead planning agencies or mission
         commanders will satisfy formation briefing requirements. Coordination of these formations will
         include designation of mission commander responsibilities for all phases of the formation opera-
         tion.
         18.6.1.3. Unit Responsibilities. Each unit will develop post takeoff separation procedures and
         departure separation plans with the local controlling agency. Each plan must consider emergency
         aspects, aircraft performance capabilities, terrain features, penetration of weather after takeoff,
         and local ATC restrictions. Procedures should also be developed for items such as aborts, lost
         communications, EMCON, and the recovery of formation aircraft.
      18.6.2. Filing Procedures. Flight plans for all formation members will reflect the same route of flight
      for the portion of flight the aircraft will be in formation. Local procedures for filing may be used pro-
      vided they are coordinated and documented in writing by the unit and local FAA (or ICAO) represen-
      tatives.
      18.6.3. Taxi Procedures. Follow the taxi sequence established in the briefing. Maintain safe interval
      and a safe speed during taxi.
      18.6.4. Takeoff Timing Interval. Defined as the time between initiation of takeoff power for each suc-
      cessive aircraft in the formation. Use of takeoff power radio calls is not recommended. Minimum
      takeoff timing interval is 60 seconds between KC-10s and other aircraft in the formation. Takeoff
      intervals may be increased, or sequence may be varied as necessary, depending on aircraft accelera-
      tion and performance, training requirements, weather, airfield conditions, and mission requirements.
      See AFTTP 3-3.22A, Chapter 5 for more guidance.
      18.6.5. Formation Takeoff Procedure (Hold-Line through Takeoff). Receivers should takeoff first.
      Any time a takeoff is aborted, an abort call will be made by the aborting aircraft over the ATC radio
      frequency being used by the formation. At bases with dual runway operations, aborting aircraft should
      identify the runway in use. An additional radio call announcing an abort is recommended over the for-
      mation interplane frequency.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 187


  18.6.6. Departure. Normal planned climb speed below 10,000 feet MSL is 250 KIAS, unless a higher
  speed is required to accommodate the Vmm of the heaviest aircraft in the formation. Above 10,000
  feet MSL, for KC-10/KC-10 or KC-10/KC-135 cell formation departures, the normal planned climb
  speed is 290 knots (NOTE: this equates to 295 KIAS in the KC-135) for formations with KC-10s less
  than 500,000 pounds gross weight and 310 knots (NOTE: this equates to 315 KIAS in the KC-135)
  for formations with KC-10s equal to or greater than 500,000 pounds gross weight. Planned climb
  speeds apply to the lead aircraft only. Following aircraft may exceed/lag these speeds as necessary to
  accomplish the rejoin and maintain proper formation position. In all cases, formation leaders may
  adjust the climb speed schedule as mission requirements and aircraft performance dictate. Planned
  climb speed will not be less than Vmm of the heaviest aircraft in the formation. If visual, radar, A/A
  Tacan, TCAS, and radio contact are all lost, and altitude separation cannot be ensured, lost wingman
  and locally developed abort procedures will be accomplished.
     18.6.6.1. Formation Join-Up. Differential airspeed and/or visual cut-off in departure turns are the
     approved methods for formation join-up. The use of visual cut-off is restricted to day/VMC oper-
     ations only. Altitude separation will be carefully monitored during closure to enroute spacing.
     Under other than VMC or when visual contact cannot be maintained with all formation members,
     altitude separation will be accomplished using TCAS or by periodically having each aircraft in the
     formation report its altitude or flight level. During night or instrument flight conditions, aircraft
     should turn at the same geographic points as the preceding aircraft.
     18.6.6.2. Buddy Departures. Buddy departures may be used by collocated tanker and fighter or
     bomber units. The intent of this type of departure is to facilitate the join-up of receivers with their
     mated tankers. The procedures below are generalized and may require modification based on air-
     craft and airspace limitations.
         18.6.6.2.1. VMC Procedures. VMC procedures may be used when weather (ceiling and visi-
         bility) is 3000/5 or greater. Receivers will normally launch first and intercept an arc to place
         themselves on extended (approximately 10 NM) final to the departure runway. When the
         receiver calls 10 NM final, or the last receiver turns cross wind, or on predetermined timing,
         the tanker will launch. Continue with a straight ahead rejoin or according to briefed departure
         routing.
         18.6.6.2.2. IMC Procedures. Under IMC or when weather is less than 3000/5, plan to rendez-
         vous the formation at an orbit point along the route of flight. Tankers will normally launch first
         unless mission fuel load and performance considerations dictate otherwise. Receivers should
         be rejoined prior to rendezvous with the tankers.
  18.6.7. Level-Off. An altitude block will be obtained for all intermediate and final level-off altitudes.
  Block altitudes will provide a minimum of 500-foot separation between aircraft. If ARTCC will not
  approve a block altitude, then request IFR separation or hard IFR altitudes for each aircraft in forma-
  tion.
  18.6.8. Airborne Aborts. Any aborting aircraft should clear the planned launch stream and take
  appropriate actions dictated by the reason for abort. Aborting aircraft will obtain ATC clearance prior
  to altering their route, or declare an emergency and deviate as necessary. The formation leader and
  other formation members should be ready to assist the aborting aircraft in any way possible.
188                                                     AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


18.7. En Route Formation. En route formation consists of multiple tanker aircraft in trail, stacked up at
500-foot intervals with 1 NM separation (2 NM may be used for contingency operations). The primary
means of maintaining proper formation position are radar under instrument conditions and visual or radar
under visual conditions. When visual conditions permit, minimize radio transmissions. Heading and air-
speed changes need not be announced. In IMC, the formation leader should ensure all formation members
are aware of heading and airspeed changes, either through thorough pre-briefing, or use of inter-plane
communications. Aircrews will monitor the position of all other aircraft and, on inter-plane, notify any
aircraft excessively out of position.
      18.7.1. Turns. The formation leader should pre-brief specific bank angles for turns. This will help
      reduce inter-plane communications and aid in maintaining formation position. To maintain formation
      position during turns, all aircraft must initiate the turn over the same geographic point, unless execut-
      ing a formation retrograde training maneuver as described in AFTTP 3-3.22A.
         18.7.1.1. Echelon Formation. Turns greater than 30 degrees into the echelon are permitted only in
         an emergency. Turns into an echelon are limited to 15 degrees of bank. All aircraft must execute
         the turn at the same time, or when time permits, start with the last aircraft, then the next to last air-
         craft, etc. If turns greater than 30 degrees are necessary for mission requirements, the formation
         leader should direct all aircraft to assume normal en route trail formation.
      18.7.2. Airspeed and Altitude. Formation climbs and descents will be accomplished using a constant
      airspeed and vertical velocity. The formation leader will ensure enroute airspeed is compatible with
      the most restrictive aircraft in the formation. Pre-brief, or announce on interplane frequency, rates of
      climb/descent and airspeed increases/decreases.
      18.7.3. Autopilot Operations. The autopilot should be used to reduce fatigue and aid in altitude sepa-
      ration. Consideration should be given to placing an aircraft with an inoperative or malfunctioning
      autopilot in last position in the formation for missions with extended duration in formation.
      18.7.4. Visual Station-Keeping. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.22A for visual station-keeping techniques. Dur-
      ing operational situations requiring EMCON 3 or 4, and marginal visibility prohibits normal forma-
      tion spacing, a compressed trail formation may be used. Formations may be compressed, but should
      not be less than 1/2NM spacing between aircraft.

18.8. Lost Wingman Procedures. These procedures are to be used when visual, A/A TACAN, TCAS,
radar, or radio contact cannot be maintained and altitude separation cannot be ensured. In any lost wing-
man situation, immediate separation of aircraft is essential to safety. Upon losing all contact with the
leader, or if unable to maintain formation due to disorientation, the wingman will simultaneously execute
the applicable lost wingman procedure while transitioning to instruments. The bank angle used to achieve
separation should equal the number of degrees to be turned. Smooth application of control inputs is
imperative to minimize the effects of spatial disorientation. Any aircraft, which can maintain contact with
an aircraft executing a lost wingman maneuver will remain in formation with that aircraft until otherwise,
directed by the leader. When lead is notified of a lost wingman, lead will take appropriate action, as the
situation dictates, until positive separation is assured. Lead will establish a reference heading and altitude
after initial separation is assured. During recovery, if the flight has a block altitude clearance, wingmen
should establish appropriate altitude separation.
      18.8.1. Two Aircraft Flights:
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                  189


     18.8.1.1. In wings-level flight (climbing, descending, or level) simultaneously transition to instru-
     ments, inform lead, turn 15 degrees away and maintain new heading for 15 seconds, then resume
     course. Adjust to formation or obtain separate clearance if required.
     18.8.1.2. In turns (climbing, descending, or level):
         18.8.1.2.1. On the outside of the turn, transition to instruments, roll to wings level and inform
         the leader. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to resuming turn. Adjust to for-
         mation or obtain separate clearance as required.
         18.8.1.2.2. On the inside of the turn, simultaneously transition to instruments to maintain
         established bank angle, reduce airspeed by 10 KIAS to ensure clearance, and inform lead.
         Lead will simultaneously roll wings level, maintain airspeed, and acknowledge wingman’s
         call. If lead has acknowledged the lost wingman call and confirms he or she has rolled wings
         level, the wingman will, after 15 seconds, roll wings level, establish 500 feet altitude separa-
         tion, turn to lead’s referenced heading and attempt to acquire lead on radar. If loss of visual
         contact is not acknowledged by lead, maintain established bank angle, establish 500 feet alti-
         tude separation, roll out on new heading, attempt to acquire lead on radar, and form into
         enroute formation position. If radar contact cannot be re-established, obtain separate clearance
         from the controlling agency.
  18.8.2. Three Aircraft Flights. If only one aircraft in the flight becomes separated, the procedures
  above would provide safe separation. However, as it is impossible for number three to immediately
  ascertain that number two still has visual contact with the leader, it is imperative number three’s initial
  action be based on the assumption number two has also become separated. If number two is still in
  visual or radar contact, he or she will maintain position. If number two goes lost wingman, he or she
  will follow the procedures outlined above. Number three will follow the procedures listed below:
     18.8.2.1. In wings level flight (climbing, descending, or level) simultaneously transition to instru-
     ments, inform lead, turn 30 degrees away, and maintain new heading for 30 seconds, then resume
     course. Adjust to formation or obtain separate clearances as required.
     18.8.2.2. In Turns (climbing, descending, level):
         18.8.2.2.1. On the outside of the turn, simultaneously transition to instruments, inform lead
         and reverse direction of turn for 15 seconds to ensure separation from lead and number two.
         Adjust to formation or obtain separate clearance as required.
         18.8.2.2.2. On the inside of the turn, simultaneously transition to instruments to maintain
         established bank angle, reduce airspeed by 20 KIAS to ensure clearance, and inform lead.
         Lead will simultaneously roll wings level, maintain airspeed and acknowledge the wingman’s
         call. If lead has acknowledged the lost wingman call and confirms he or she has rolled wings
         level, number three will, after 30 seconds, roll wings level, establish 1000 feet altitude separa-
         tion, turn to lead’s referenced heading, and attempt to acquire lead and number two on radar.
         If loss of visual contact is not acknowledged by lead, maintain established bank angle, estab-
         lish 1000 feet altitude separation, roll out on new heading, attempt to acquire lead on radar,
         and form into en route formation position. If radar contact is not re-established, obtain separate
         clearance from the controlling agency.
     18.8.2.3. Lost Wingman Procedures During Receiver AR. Depending on the makeup of the AR
     formation, it is possible that in the event of a breakaway, receiver aircraft may find themselves
190                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


         co-altitude with another aircraft in the formation. If, during a breakaway, the receiver aircraft loses
         sight of the tanker aircraft, T.O. 1-1C-1-32 requires the receiver aircraft to descend to an altitude
         1000 feet below the tanker. In the event this places the receiver aircraft co-altitude with another
         aircraft in the formation and visual, A/A TACAN, TCAS, or radar contact with the co-altitude air-
         craft cannot be maintained, descend to an altitude that will provide positive separation from other
         aircraft and decrease airspeed to ensure lateral separation.

18.9. Formation Position Changes. Prior to executing any position change, the formation leader must
ensure all formation members understand the procedures to be followed for intra-formation position
changes. Formation position change procedures will be covered in the formation leader’s briefing. Forma-
tion position changes should only be accomplished in straight and level flight, and once initiated, they will
take priority over all other activities. Comply with the following when accomplishing formation position
changes:
      18.9.1. Maintain radar and/or visual contact throughout the formation position change.
         18.9.1.1. If radar and visual contact are lost during a position change, maintain altitude, and
         advise formation lead contact has been lost. Ensure positive separation by any means available
         and do not attempt to rejoin the formation until positive radar or visual contact is established.
      18.9.2. Do not attempt to refuel receiver aircraft or obtain individual ARTCC clearances during for-
      mation maneuver and position changes.
      18.9.3. Altitude Changes. Ensure lateral separation between formation members prior to conducting
      altitude changes. Coordinate altitude changes over inter-plane frequency.
      18.9.4. Aircraft changing positions will assume the call sign of their new intra-formation position
      (TOGA 1, TOGA 2, etc.) and formation leadership, if appropriate, when all aircraft are level at their
      new altitude and established in their new position. All aircraft will then acknowledge with their new
      intra-formation call sign. Aircraft will not change their individual call sign that is filed on the flight
      plan. Call sign of the flight will be the call sign of the lead aircraft, or as directed by ARTCC. The new
      lead aircraft will squawk the assigned mode 3, or as directed by ARTCC.
      18.9.5. VMC Position Change Procedures. The following procedures will be used to effect an aircraft
      lead or position change with other aircraft during VMC. All changes in heading, position, and altitude
      will be pre-briefed and coordinated on inter-plane frequency.
         18.9.5.1. Wingmen will maintain a minimum 1/2 mile in trail and descend or maintain 500-foot
         altitude separation. The aircraft to assume the lead will move laterally (normally to the right) 1/2
         mile. Use 15 degrees of bank to turn 15 degrees from heading then turn back to heading using 15
         degrees of bank. The wingman will accelerate and pass the leader. (Maintain 1/2 mile lateral sep-
         aration.)
         18.9.5.2. As the wingman passes the leader, he or she will assume lead responsibilities and climb,
         descend, or maintain altitude as required after positive visual separation is confirmed.
         18.9.5.3. The new wingman (old lead) will obtain or maintain a 500-foot altitude separation as
         required, place IFF to standby, notify the new lead when approaching position in-trail, and con-
         firm his or her altitude. At this time, the new leader will decelerate to briefed airspeed.
         18.9.5.4. The wingman will assume trail position behind the leader and make a normal closure to
         proper position.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                            191


  18.9.6. IMC Position Change Procedures (Any Aircraft Moves to Lead). The following procedures
  will be used during IMC for position changes requiring any aircraft, or element, in the formation to
  move to the lead position. These procedures are applicable for 2- through 6-ship IMC formation posi-
  tion changes.
     18.9.6.1. Lead determines the aircraft or element to move forward (maneuvering aircraft). The
     maneuvering aircraft or element will echelon (normally right) using approximately 30 degrees of
     bank and turning 30 degrees from formation heading. When 30 degrees off heading, reverse the
     turn using approximately 30 degrees of bank and return to formation heading. This will provide an
     offset of approximately 2 NMs.
     18.9.6.2. After established in echelon, the maneuvering aircraft or element will accelerate for-
     ward, increasing airspeed a recommended 15 KIAS. The maneuvering aircraft or element should
     then resume formation airspeed and stabilize approximately 1 1/4 NMs forward range from the
     original lead. When the maneuvering aircraft or element is in the forward echelon position and
     positive visual or electronic contact is established, conduct the required altitude changes.
         18.9.6.2.1. For 2 NM in-trail formations, the maneuvering aircraft or element will accelerate
         forward, increasing airspeed a recommended 30 KIAS. The maneuvering aircraft or element
         should then resume formation airspeed and stabilize approximately 2 1/4 NMs forward range
         from the original lead.
     18.9.6.3. The maneuvering aircraft or element will then move into lead position using no more
     than 15 degree heading corrections.
     18.9.6.4. If applicable, the formation will then establish proper aircraft spacing. The formation
     lead should be advised by the last aircraft after the formation is reformed. Assume new intra-for-
     mation call signs (TOGA 1, TOGA 2, etc.) and reset rotating beacon or strobe and navigation
     lights.
  18.9.7. IMC Position Change Procedures (Any Aircraft Moves to Trail). The following procedures
  will be used during IMC for position changes requiring any aircraft, or element, in the formation to
  move to the trail position. These procedures are applicable for 2- through 6-ship IMC formation posi-
  tion changes.
     18.9.7.1. Lead determines the aircraft or element to move aft (maneuvering aircraft). The maneu-
     vering aircraft or element will echelon (normally right) using approximately 30 degrees of bank
     and turning 30 degrees from the formation heading. When 30 degrees off heading, reverse the turn
     using approximately 30 degrees of bank and return to formation heading. This will provide an off-
     set of approximately 2 NMs.
     18.9.7.2. After established in echelon, the maneuvering aircraft or element will decelerate toward
     the end of the formation, decreasing airspeed a recommended 15 KIAS. The maneuvering aircraft
     or element should then resume formation airspeed and stabilize approximately 3/4 NM aft of the
     last aircraft or element. When the maneuvering aircraft or element is in the aft echelon position
     and positive visual or electronic contact is established, formation lead directs required altitude
     changes.
         18.9.7.2.1. For 2-NM in-trail formations, the maneuvering aircraft or element will decelerate
         toward the end of the formation, decreasing airspeed a recommended 30 KIAS. The maneu-
192                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


             vering aircraft or element should then resume formation airspeed and stabilize approximately
             1 3/4 NMs aft of the last aircraft.
         18.9.7.3. The maneuvering aircraft or element will then move into position using no more than 15
         degree heading corrections.
         18.9.7.4. If applicable, the formation will then establish proper aircraft spacing. The formation
         lead should be advised by the last aircraft after the formation is reformed. Assume new intra-for-
         mation signs (TOGA 1, TOGA 2, etc.) and reset rotating beacon and strobe and navigation lights.

18.10. Formation Break-Up and Recovery. Formation separation procedures will be thoroughly
planned and briefed by the formation leader. Do not initiate formation separation procedures without
ATC approval.
      18.10.1. If formation descent and arrival is desired, detailed descent profile, airspeed reduction, and
      configuration procedures will be thoroughly briefed.

18.11. Mission Debriefing and Critique. A complete mission debriefing and critique should be con-
ducted by the formation leader following the mission.

                                     AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION

20.1. General.
      20.1.1. This chapter applies to Air Force KC-10 aircrews, aeromedical evacuation aircrews, and all
      management levels concerned with operations of the KC-10 aircraft. All operators involved in aero-
      medical evacuation (AE) missions on KC-10 aircraft will use this AFI.
      20.1.2. KC-10 aircraft may be used for AE transport of ill or injured DoD members and their depen-
      dents. These AE missions may be directed at any time by C2 agencies. AE personnel will utilize the
      procedures in applicable AFI 11-2KC-10 and 41-XXX series, in conjunction with this publication, to
      accomplish the AE mission.

20.2. Operational Control and Reporting of Aeromedical Evacuation Forces.
      20.2.1. HQ AMC is lead command for AE. HQ AMC Directorate of Operations (AMC/A3) is the
      executive agent for operational AE missions.
      20.2.2. C2 of AE missions is the same as other airlift missions.
      20.2.3. The PIC is responsible for command and control of all persons aboard the aircraft during an
      AE mission. In matters of flight safety, crew duty waivers, or operational considerations, the decisions
      of the PIC are final.
      20.2.4. The Medical Crew Director (MCD) is a qualified flight nurse responsible for the overall
      supervision of patient care and management of AECMs assigned to AE missions. The MCD advises
      the PIC on patients’ conditions and the use of medical equipment that may affect aircraft operations.
      The MCD is directly responsible for the safety and medical well being of patients on the aircraft and
      coordinates enplaning and deplaning procedures with the AEOO and supporting agencies. In matters
      of patient care, the decisions of the MCD are final.
      20.2.5. HQ AMC Command Surgeon (AMC/SG) is responsible for providing clinical standards and
      procedures concerning the treatment of patients in-flight.
      20.2.6. The Aeromedical Evacuation Operations Officer (AEOO), if available, is a Medical Services
      Corps officer or a Medical Administration Specialist/Technician who acts as a liaison between the AE
      crew and ground support facilities. When available, the AEOO is responsible for coordinating the
      launch and recovery of the AE mission

20.3. Alerting Procedures.
      20.3.1. At all locations AMC C2 agency will alert the PIC who will alert the MCD. The MCD will
      alert the medical crew. The goal is to link the PIC, local AMC C2 agency and MCD before mission
      execution.
      20.3.2. When the AE crew is staged separate from the flight crew, the MCD will contact AMC local
      C2 agency and establish alert, showtime, etc. with the C2 agency. The MCD will make every effort to
      communicate with the flight crew any mission irregularities prior to crew rest. Utilize local AMC C2
      agency to leave messages for non-emergency. Crew rest will be based on scheduled launch time. Do
      not violate crew rest.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                 195


   20.3.3. The local AMC C2 agency will provide the PIC/MCD AE mission information. Local C2
   agency are the link between the AE crews and the PIC, thus permitting mission status updates to both
   parties without interruption of crew rest.
   20.3.4. AE mission requirements can change depending on clinical status of patient(s) and aircraft
   availability. The MCD is responsible for communicating these changes with the PIC and local AMC
   C2 agency to de-conflict problems.

20.4. Pilot In Command Responsibilities.
   20.4.1. Establish communication link with the MCD during pre-mission planning and throughout the
   mission.

196                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


      20.6.2. Assist BO/maintenance crew with aircraft configuration for AE operations.
      20.6.3. Install and remove medical equipment/supplies.
      20.6.4. Assist the BO with observation and care of passengers when it does not interfere with primary
      duties.
      20.6.5. The MCD or designated AECM should be on aircraft inter-phone (headset) for all phases of
      flight, and will be on aircraft inter-phone during critical phases of flight to include take-off and land-
      ing.
      20.6.6. The BO will provide the MCD with a headset and interphone cord when mission requirements
      allow. Ensure MCDs are provided instruction regarding the use of aircraft communication equipment
      and location of cargo/passenger compartment interphone jacks.

20.7. Ground Operations.
      20.7.1. Engines should be shut down during enplaning and deplaning of patients.
      20.7.2. Vehicle supervision, movement, and placement in and around the aircraft, are the responsibil-
      ity of the PIC or BO (as applicable). The PIC or BO should ensure a spotter is available and pre-posi-
      tioned chalks are in place prior to positioning the AE Patient Loading System (PLS) at the cargo door
      for patient loading and unloading.

20.8. Refueling Operations.
      20.8.1. Refueling normally begins after deplaning patients are off the aircraft and prior to enplaning
      that station's patients. Refer to paragraph 12.4.2. for additional guidance regarding concurrent servic-
      ing procedures.
      20.8.2. CS may be accomplished with patients onboard provided:
         20.8.2.1. The CSS coordinates with all personnel involved prior to beginning concurrent opera-
         tions.
         20.8.2.2. Prior to starting concurrent servicing, the total number of patients, passengers, and crew
         on board the aircraft will be given to the fire department.
         20.8.2.3. At least two AECMs (one must be a FN) remain onboard to observe patients and assist
         patients in the event of an egress.

20.9. Aircraft Configuration:
      20.9.1. On AE missions, configure the aircraft during pre-flight. When in the B configuration (16
      seats), the number of seats for AE personnel/passengers will be limited. If seats need to be removed to
      provide space for more than one litter, seating becomes critical. In this case, the PIC and MCD, with
      coordination with the appropriate C2 agencies, must make the decision of who is required on the mis-
      sion, based on the needs of the patient and the mission.
      20.9.2. Litter Support Provisions: None available on aircraft. A configuration wavier from the KC-10
      SPO through HQ AMC/A37V is required to floor load litters on the KC-10.
      20.9.3. The Patient Support Pallet (PSP) is a pallet-based system of seat and litter accommodation.
      The PSP is authorized for use on the KC-10. For PSP management refer to the current Patient Support
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                               197


  Pallet, Concept of Operations located on HQ AMC/A37V web page and also AFI 11-2AEV3,
  Addenda A, Aeromedical Evacuation Operations Configuration/Mission Planning.
  20.9.4. The PSP will be transported to the aircraft by aerial port personnel, positioned and secured on
  the aircraft by the BO and configured by the AE crew.
  20.9.5. The AE crew will configure the pallet. BO should open aircraft 3 hours prior take off to facil-
  itate AECM aircraft configuration. Loading the PSP and IAU should be accomplished before the
  flight crew leaves the aircraft or prior to the crew entering crew rest. In cases when the KC-10 is con-
  figured at an enroute stop, the MCD will coordinate with the PIC and BO, to determine when the air-
  craft should be configured for the next day’s AE mission prior to bed-down. When possible, (crew
  rest/duty day permitting), the aircraft should be configured the day prior to the mission. The MCD is
  ultimately responsible to ensure coordination between appropriate agencies has occurred or are in
  place to deliver PSP(s) to the aircraft.
  20.9.6. PSP configuration will be determined by patient requirements. Each seat has storage capacity
  for required prepositioned life support (EPOS and life vest).
  20.9.7. Extenders and spacers will be used with the PSP(s) to mitigate trip hazards created by uneven
  surfaces.
  20.9.8. Slight forward-aft pallet movement may occur as the pallet shifts against the pallet lock. To
  prevent this occurrence, secure the PSP with a cargo tie-down strap.
  20.9.9. For patient comfort and to permit in-flight rest for patients, use the following for missions
  over 4 hours in duration:
     20.9.9.1. Minimum of 2 litters must be available for ambulatory patients.
     20.9.9.2. One seat must be reserved for every 3 litter patients.
     20.9.9.3. An emergency litter will be set up on all AE missions.
  20.9.10. Electrical Power. The electrical cable assembly set (ECAS) does not provide an adapter
  (pigtail) for use on KC-10, 110VAC/400Hz electrical outlets. Do not operate the electrical frequency
  converter from this aircraft. Use only battery-operated medical equipment.
  20.9.11. Therapeutic Oxygen. Therapeutic oxygen is not an integral system on the KC-10 aircraft.
  Use the Patient Therapeutic Liquid Oxygen (PTLOX) system.
  20.9.12. Integral patient/passenger emergency oxygen is not available on the aircraft. In the event of
  an emergency, patients and passengers will use the aircraft drop down/seat back or wall mounted
  Emergency Oxygen System, Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS) or portable oxygen cylin-
  ders, if available.
  20.9.13. AECMs will have portable oxygen available. The four portable oxygen cylinders located in
  the crew bunks will be made available for AE crew use. Bunk occupants will use EPOS in place of the
  portable oxygen cylinders.
  20.9.14. Do not secure aircraft or medical equipment adjacent to an emergency exit in a manner that
  will prevent or impede egress.
  20.9.15. Use the adult/child life preserver for patients.

      20.9.16. Patient Support Pallet. There are no special loading procedures for the PSP. The BO will be
      required to move the side restraint rails in pallet position 2 R to accommodate the 108 by 88-inch pal-
      let. PSPs will be loaded unassembled and put together on the aircraft by the aeromedical evacuation
      crewmember (AECM) team. Litter stanchions will be placed on the outside edges of the pallet, creat-
      ing an aisle down the middle of the pallet. Patients will be oriented with head forward for flight due to
      available oxygen masks. Passengers will not occupy the row of seats immediately aft of patient litters.
      These seats will be occupied by AECMs or crewmembers only supplied with aircraft portable oxygen
      cylinders. PSPs are equipped with ramps to blend the forward pallet surface with the aircraft floor.
      WARNING: Location of aircraft seats may prevent use of PSP ramps exposing cargo rollers, dual
      pawl restraint assemblies and omnidirectional conveyor assemblies causing a tripping hazard. Brief
      crew, passengers, AE crew and litter bearers of the hazard.
         20.9.16.1. Weight and balance information: the PSP is a standard 463L pallet with seat tracks
         installed. The PSP weighs 826 lbs empty. For weight and balance computations use a weight of
         320 lbs per patient. This will include the weight of the patient plus medical equipment. Use the
         pallet centroid for computing weight and balance information. Each PSP seat weights 60 lbs and
         is rated at 260 lbs. PSP parts weights: extension 17 lbs, ramp 12 lbs and spacer 9 lbs.
             20.9.16.1.1. KC-10A configuration code H: two litter tiers consisting of three litters each,
             along the outer aspect of the pallet. Weight as configured is 820 lbs. A variation of code H is
             PSP-M (mixed seat/litters configuration): one tier litter consisting of three litters and either
             two or three seats positioned along the outer aspect of the pallet. Weight with 2 seats is 760
             lbs. Weight with 3 seats is 820. NOTE: During an in-flight medical emergency, seat may be
             removed to increase work space.
             20.9.16.1.2. KC-10A configuration code I: two pallets each with two litter tiers consisting of
             three litters for a total between pallets of 12 litters. A variation of code I which mounts seats in
             place of litters is PSP-M (mixed seat/litters configuration). Use the same weights as in para-
             graph 20.9.16.1.1. for the two and three seat variations. NOTE: PSP seats will be configured
             to face forward.
         20.9.16.2. Load the displaced IAU seat pallet(s) in the forward-most positions on the left side of
         the cargo compartment. The side restraint rails will be moved outboard to accommodate the 108
         by 108 IAU seat pallets. Leave the pallet position behind the displaced seat pallet(s) empty due to
         inconsistent side rail coverage. In no case will the displaced seat pallets be left behind after recon-
         figuring to carry the PSP. PSP configuration codes H and I are temporary configurations and the
         seats must be reinstalled when the PSP is removed from the aircraft.
         20.9.16.3. For patient privacy and comfort, brief passengers and crew not to conjugate around the
         PSP. If feasible, do not seat families with small children near the PSP.
         20.9.16.4. Seat ambulatory patients and attendants in KC-10A airline seats.

20.10. Passengers and Cargo.
      20.10.1. The PIC, with the concurrence of the MCD, will ensure maximum aircraft utilization for
      passengers and cargo. Passenger restrictions based upon patient considerations will be identified when
      seats are released. The PIC will advise the appropriate C2 agency of the number seats available for
      passengers.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                199


   20.10.2. Cargo and passengers may be carried with patients unless a clear detriment to the health and
   well being of the patient or passengers can be demonstrated. The decision will be made by the MCD,
   considering the need for maximum utilization of the aircraft. Conflicts will be referred to the respec-
   tive tasking AE command element for a decision. The MCD/BO will ensure patient egress is not
   affected by mixed cargo/patient loads.
   20.10.3. Cargo will not be bumped except in unusual/abnormal cases, and only after the MCD has
   coordinated with the PIC and notified the tasking AE command element.
   20.10.4. Do not move ambulatory patients to litters in order to provide seating for additional patients
   or passengers.
   20.10.5. PT LOX may be transported for positioning and depositioning of operational/contingency
   support AE Missions.
       20.10.5.1. A maximum of 25 PTLOX serviced units may be transported simultaneously without
       Hazmat certification. Processing through aerial port is not required. When shipping more than six
       PTLOX containers as cargo, do not cover with plastic, as this may cause a high concentration of
       oxygen levels. Ensure the cargo floor is free from any oil or petroleum products.
   20.10.6. Hazardous cargo will not normally be transported aboard AE missions except in extreme cir-
   cumstances.

20.11. Crash/Fire/Rescue.
   20.11.1. Aircraft carrying patient(s) will be provided CFR protection per T.O. 00-25-172. Stand-by
   CFR vehicle is not necessary during normal operations. A CFR vehicle can be available upon request.
   The flight crew will coordinate CFR requirements.
   20.11.2. At non-AMC bases, non-U.S. military bases, and civilian airfields, the controlling agency
   will coordinate the CFR coverage, as necessary. The request for CFR vehicle coverage may be denied.
   This will not prevent refueling operations from occurring.

20.12. AE Call Sign/Use of Priority Clearance.
   20.12.1. AIREVAC Priority. The PIC may request AIREVAC priority for preferential ATC handling
   if a delay will affect a patient’s well being. The PIC will request priority handling if AE missions are
   experiencing long delays during takeoff or landing phases, which will affect a patient’s condition.

20.13. Not Used.

20.14. Aerial Refueling. Aerial refueling may be required for aircraft operation when patients are on
board. A/R may create turbulence, which can affect patient care. All patients should be screened by vali-
dating flight surgeon to ensure they tolerate the air refueling.

20.15. Floor Loading Procedures. Ensure floor loaded patients have EPOS available. Due to the
unavailability of self-presenting emergency oxygen, patients will only be floor loaded for priority or
urgent aeromedical evacuation movements, during emergency situations, or for contingency operations.
When floor loading of patients is required, comply with the following.
200                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


      20.15.1. Patients may be floor loaded in the forward passenger area. Patients are positioned with head
      toward the flight deck, longitudinally on the aircraft floor. Seats will need to be removed.
         20.15.1.1. In the B or D configuration, a single litter may be placed on the aircraft centerline,
         replacing the first two rows of center seats. Refer to Figure 20.1.
         20.15.1.2. Alternatively when in the D configuration, remove the two rows of seats immediately
         aft of the first row of outboard right seats. Refer to Figure 20.1. Some medical equipment may be
         placed in the seats aft of the litter.
      20.15.2. Use A-7000 tie-down fittings in the seat tracks and 5000 lb tie-down devices. Shoring is not
      required, however the litters should be placed with metal stirrups in the seat tracks, or put protective
      material under the litter stirrups to protect the aircraft floor. Use one tie-down device at the end of
      each litter.
      20.15.3. Maximum aircraft altitude is FL350 when carrying floor loaded patients.

KC-10 aircraft are properly configured in accordance with this chapter and applicable aircraft T.O.s. Con-
204                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006


figuration codes designate the setup of the aircraft. Options for each configuration determine the available
space for cargo and passengers.
      23.5.1. Normal configuration for local or training missions will be code B.
      23.5.2. All aircraft will be configured for deployment as required by implementing fragmentation
      (FRAG) or operations order (OPORD).
      23.5.3. The unit will use the configuration checklists approved by HQ AMC/A44. Checklist distribu-
      tion will be made to all agencies involved with the actual aircraft configuration.
      23.5.4. After configuration has been determined, the Production Superintendent will be the single
      point of contact to ensure required configuration actions are completed and verified by tasked agency.
      23.5.5. Aircraft configuration at all en route stops is the responsibility of the pilot in command.
      23.5.6. One 463L pallet, to be used for baggage, and aircraft support equipment, will be kept onboard
      each aircraft at pallet position 13L. This pallet may be removed if space is required for cargo. This
      pallet will not be added as a Chart C entry; the boom operator will make a Form F entry.
      23.5.7. ESKs or MSKs will be carried when required, as outlined in each aircraft configuration.
      23.5.8. On a temporary basis, additional equipment may be required to satisfy mission requirements.
      When required, the tasked unit must assure that coordination includes appropriate functional areas and
      that additional equipment is onboard.

23.6. Configuration Procedures and Responsibilities. Units will determine the most suitable aircraft
for deployment based on implementing operation or FRAG order. Maintenance scheduling or Special
Mission’s Airlift will initiate work orders that require configuration and weight/balance checks. Unit
supervisors are responsible for ensuring that required items are carried onboard aircraft as required.
Excess quantities of these items will not be carried without the Production Superintendents approval,
unless specifically directed by deployment orders or required for the deployment by unit supervisors.
      23.6.1. Weight and Balance. Unit weight and balance personnel will ensure accuracy and currency of
      Chart “C”. When aircraft are changed from daily configuration code “B” to another standard configu-
      ration, the change will be reflected on Form “F” by the boom operator. If a nonstandard configuration
      is required, the weight and balance data will be provided by the local configuration checklist.
      23.6.2. In the remarks section of an airlift request, users will supply cargo loading equipment infor-
      mation (i.e. pallet sub-floor requirements).
      23.6.3. Aerial Port personnel will deliver and load cargo handling equipment in excess of that
      required to be maintained onboard aircraft daily. This includes all 463L equipment.
      23.6.4. Cargo missions originating at the main operating base (MOB) will be load planned by the
      transportation unit in coordination with the wing current operations. Re-deployment load planning
      will be the responsibility of the unit movement officer.
      23.6.5. Maintenance personnel will ensure the aircraft is returned to daily configuration on return to
      home station.

23.7. Aircraft Configuration Waivers. Units will request a waiver from 327 CLSG/GFLT routed
through HQ AMC/A37VK for any departure from the standard configurations. Approved distinguished
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                  205


visitor (DV) configurations will not require special waivers, nor does the simple removal or addition of
normal KC-10 aircraft equipment unless it affects safety.
   23.7.1. The unit will provide the following information: aircraft serial number, originating station,
   departure date and time, justification for waiver, and effect on cargo, passenger, and air refueling
   capability.
   23.7.2. If the waiver is granted, HQ AMC/A37VK will provide the unit with the waiver ID number
   for specific mission and items approved. (Information copy to the 18AF TACC/XOCL.)
   23.7.3. If an IAU or extra IAU is to be carried from one point to another, it may be carried as aircraft
   equipment. The left side outboard restraint rails can be moved to their outboard positions, and the IAU
   positioned down the left side of the aircraft. The seats will not be occupied during takeoff, landing, or
   flight. No waiver is required.

23.8. Permanent Aircraft Configuration Waivers. The following is a list of permanent KC-10A Non
Standard Configuration Waivers. A nonstandard configuration exists after removal, relocation, or addi-
tion of aircraft equipment referenced on DD365-1, Weight Checklist Record, Chart A - Basic.
   23.8.1. Joint Task Force/C2 Module. Includes: JTF C2 Module, JTF C2 Communications Suite, 7
   Pallets (not including the Module or Communications Suite), and 75 seats. Pallets 10L, 10R, 11L,
   11R, 12L, 12R, and 13L are reserved for aircraft equip, special equip, galley pallet, and baggage. 4
   seats are for crew chiefs, support personnel, or extra crew members. Seat availability will be dictated
   by mission requirements.
   23.8.2. DV 1 Configuration. The weight and balance information for this configuration is provided to
   enable the Boom Operator to make a one line entry on the DD365 – 4, Weight and Balance Clear-
   ance Form F – Transport/Tactical, to account for the equipment. Each affected agency involved in
   the configuration change is responsible for ensuring correct installation of equipment. The aircraft
   crew chief will be the single point of contact to ensure required configuration change actions are com-
   pleted. Install two executive tables. The first one is installed between seat row 1 and 2 center. Seat row
   1C is turned 180 degrees and seat row 2C is relocated aft at station 528. The second table is located at
   station 563 after removal of seat row 3 R. The following restrictions apply:

NOTES:
     1. Aft facing seats (row 1C) will not be occupied for takeoffs and landings.
       2. Drop down oxygen must be readily available.
       3. Install a tabletop on the bunks. Nothing will be placed on the table for takeoff or landing.
       4. Install a carpeted plywood walkway from pallet position 4 through 9 right.
       23.8.2.1. Maintenance, Dash 21, and Special Mission’s Airlift, will configure the aircraft in the
       following manner for DV Configurations: Add item C- 163 DV Buffet Table on top of lower
       bunks at station # 869. Add item C- 82.1 Forward Double Center Seat to a new position at station

         23.8.2.2. Boom Operators will add (+) 121 Pounds at a moment of (+) 4.3 to the Form F.
      23.8.3. DV 2 Configuration. DV 2 Configuration is the same as DV 1 Configuration without the
      removal of the conveyors and walkway, and without the installation of the plywood walkway. Boom
      Operators will add (+) 221 Pounds at a moment of (+) 16.2 to the Form F.
      23.8.4. DV 3 Configuration. DV 3 Configuration is the same as DV 1 Configuration without the
      removal of the conveyors and walkway, and without the installation of the plywood walkway and
      Buffet table. Boom Operators will add (+) 81 Pounds at a moment of (+) 4.1 to the Form F.

23.9. Responsibilities. This section describes responsibilities and requirements (by functional area) and
provides specific guidance necessary for mission accomplishment. Exceptions will be specified in opera-
tions or FRAG order. Planning responsibilities will be in accordance with current directives.
      23.9.1. Logistics Plans. The unit logistics plans function will be the single focal point for all logistics
      support planning for deployment operations. They will maintain close coordination with the unit oper-
      ations plans function and all logistics functions to ensure all logistics support requirements are met.
      Obtain specific support capabilities available at deployment location and relay this information to
      maintenance and operations plans to be used during mission support planning. Monitor all deploy-
      ments to ensure adequate support is provided or drawn from the functional areas tasked.
         23.9.1.1. The operations group will provide the logistics plans function with information pertain-
         ing to aircraft configuration.
      23.9.2. Supply. KC-10 supply support is provided primarily by civilian contractor logistics support
      system represented at base level by the COMBS. The COMBS manager must be made aware of the
      following information for all deployments away from the MOB to ensure appropriate range and quan-
      tity of items are included in the onboard support kit: Date and length of deployment, number of air-
      craft involved, number of sorties and flying hours planned, location of FOL, and peculiar support
      equipment requirements.
NOTE: If security considerations preclude the COMBS manager from access to any of the above infor-
mation, he or she must be made aware of appropriate supply levels and military port where material is to
be shipped.
      23.9.3. Logistics Support Contractor (LSC). LSC is responsible for assembly of ESKs and MSKs.
      Quantities in kits may vary based on mission requirements. Maintenance will provide information
      required and work with COMBS manager to determine spares requirements.
      23.9.4. Senior Maintenance Supervisor. The senior maintenance supervisor is responsible for the
      deployed support kit and deployed support equipment. If required, contractor personnel may be
      deployed to manage the support kit at the FOL. These personnel must have valid security clearances
      and passports as required by KC-10 logistics support contracts. The designated kit manager will
      accept accountability prior to deployment.
         23.9.4.1. Items not available in the deployed kit. Contractor-Furnished items generated by not
         mission-capable supply (NMCS) status and partially mission-capable supply (PMCS) status will
         be relayed through 18AF TACC/XOCL to the MOB maintenance aircraft control center (MACC).
         The MOB MACC will relay requirements to production supervisors who will coordinate the
         requirements with the COMBS. Coordination is the responsibility of the senior maintenance team
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB_I 27 JULY 2006                                                                  207


       chief at the deployed location. Air Force supply items will be handled through the Air Force sup-
       ply system. Re-supply of ESKs and MSKs will be handled through 18AF TACC/XOCL.
       23.9.4.2. Accountability for deployed aircrew life support equipment will be in accordance with
       AFI 11-301V2, Maintenance and Configuration Requirements For Aircrew and Aircraft-Installed
       Life Support Equipment (LSE).

23.10. Aircraft Maintenance. The maintenance concept is based on providing an organizational level
maintenance capability. It provides preflight, launch, post-flight, recovery capability, and limited special-
ist support for line replaceable unit (LRU) removal and replacement. Deployed forces will use mainte-
nance support at the deployed location if compatible with aircraft systems. The KC-10 deployment
maintenance supervisor will supervise and control aircraft maintenance. Maintenance requirements
beyond the capability of the deployed personnel will be referred to 18AF TACC/XOCL for coordination
with MOB unless specified in operations order.

   23.18.1. Instructions for constructing the KC-10 Cargo Door Safety Net.
   STEP 1: Overall dimensions of the cargo net are 156 inches (13 feet) long by 44 inches ( 3 feet-8
   inches) tall, measured from outside edge to outside edge.
   STEP 2: Top and third horizontal webbing’s are measured 156 inches (13 feet) long. The second and
   bottom horizontal webbing are 110 inches (9 feet and 2 inches) long.
   STEP 3: All vertical webbing’s are measured 44 inches (3 feet-8 inches) long. All webbing’s are
   spaced 14 inches apart horizontally, using middle-to-middle measurements.
   STEP 4: The first vertical webbing is sewn to the first and third horizontal webbing’s at 11 inches plus
   3 inches from the left-hand side. All other vertical webbing’s are spaced 18 inches apart, using mid-
   dle-to-middle measurements.
   STEP 5: Hook assembly and slide assembly tension are attached with a 3-inch overlap (detail D),
   requiring 9 inches of webbing.
   STEP 6: Adjustment webbing is placed through the tension slide assembly, folded, and sewn to act as
   a stop.
   STEP 7: All sewing is done using size “FF” nylon thread and secured with a box X pattern. All web-
   bing ends must be finished to prevent fraying.
   STEP 8: Aircraft serial number may be inked in the upper forward net area 1 1/2-inch stencil.
