    1.3.5. Logistics and Maintenance.
       1.3.5.1. Procurement and receipt of AEDs will be coordinated by the purchasing unit
       with the 4th Medical Group (4 MDG) medical logistics office. Each unit’s AED Site
       Coordinator will be responsible for the monthly operational checks IAW manufacturer’s
       recommendations (Attachment 4).
       1.3.5.2. The Medical Maintenance (4 MDSS/SGSM) office of the 4th Medical Support
       Squadron will provide organizational maintenance. Organizational maintenance requires
       trained Biomedical Equipment Technicians (BMET) and the use of tools and test
       equipment not available to the equipment operator. A qualified BMET performs or
       supervises the maintenance. Organizational maintenance includes, but is not limited to:
       adjustment, calibration, inspection, lubrication, maintenance contract management,
       modification, repair, replacement of parts, or assemblies and subassemblies, servicing,
       and training. The equipment operator performs user maintenance, including proper
       operation and use of equipment, daily inspections, cleaning, simple lubrication, minor
       exterior repairs and operational adjustments, and reporting equipment malfunctions to a
       supervisor or the medical equipment maintenance office. The cost of battery replacement
       must be provided by the owning unit.
       1.3.5.3. Should an AED require further servicing, the unit AED Site Coordinator will
       arrange this maintenance or service with 4 MDSS/SGSM. Accountability and
       management of safety recalls and health device alert notifications will be accomplished
       utilizing the Defense Medical Logistics Standards Support System (DMLSS). AED units
       will be placed in this system to monitor the locations and points of contact, in the event of
       any recall or notification. The cost for organizational and user maintenance and/or
       replacement of a failed AED will be funded by the owning unit.
    1.3.6. Unit Commander.
       1.3.6.1. The unit commander of the purchasing organization will appoint an AED Site
       Coordinator (Attachment 5) who will serve as the primary liaison between the local
       organization and the installation PAD Program Manager, PAD Medical Director, and 4
       MDSS/SGSM.
       1.3.6.2. Will ensure all unit AED Site Coordinators are Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
       (CPR) trained (preferably instructors). This training is the responsibility of the
       purchasing organization.
       1.3.6.3. The PAD program is not a “medical” program. It is a “user” program.
       Therefore, each unit commander funds the purchase, reuse supplies, and long-term
       training for unit personnel in the facility where the AED is located.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI41-101 19 MARCH 2014                                                         5


     1.3.6.4. Each unit commander has full authority to purchase and strategically place units
     throughout their organization. Factors considered in determining AED location include
     the following: facility size and number of employees, identified high-risk/at-risk
     employees in the unit, and age of facility occupants. Installation of AEDs will be
     coordinated through 4 MDSS/SGSM and the AED Site Coordinator. The AEDs are not
     to be moved from their initial location. They will be strategically placed in a position
     where it is easily accessible and easily viewed by the general public. If it is necessary to
     move the AED, then the AED Site Coordinator must notify the PAD Program Manager
     and 4 MDSS/SGSM.
     1.3.6.5. Determine need for Traumatic Stress Response intervention following AED
     usage.
  1.3.7. AED Site Coordinator.
     1.3.7.1. Will be a member of the local organization where the AED is deployed.
     1.3.7.2. Must be trained and certified in CPR by an approved agency.
     1.3.7.3. The site coordinator will inspect the AED, check battery status and notify 4
     MDSS/SGSM if problems are discovered. Copies of the inspection sheets will be
     forwarded to the PAD Program Manager on a quarterly basis. The completed inspection
     sheets must be filed in a binder maintained at the unit. The binders will be reviewed
     semi-annually by the PAD Program Manager and at the Medical Director’s discretion.
     1.3.7.4. Within 24 hours after use of the AED, the site coordinator will forward an
     Events Summary Sheet (Attachment 6) to the Installation PAD Program Manager for
     review by the Medical Director and hand carry the used AED to 4 MDSS/SGSM, which
     is located within the 4 MDG clinic. After the AED is used, the site coordinator will use
     the post procedure checklist (Attachment 7) to ensure all post-use steps are
     accomplished.
     1.3.7.5. Establishes an equipment account with 4 MDSS/SGSM for the cost of purchase,
     supplies, batteries or any maintenance repairs. The procurement of medical items
     requires coordination and authorization through 4 MDSS/SGSM, who is the procurement
     activity center for approved AED requirements for all organizations on base. AEDs
     purchased for non-medical treatment facility organizations will be issued to non-
     Department of Health Professions Responsibility Center/Cost Center funded with
     Operations and Maintenance dollars provided by the unit.
         1.3.7.5.1. Since an AED is a piece of medical equipment, the procurement of AEDs
         for non-Medical Treatment Facility units is subject to approval by the 4 MDG
         Equipment Review Approving Authority.
         1.3.7.5.2. An initial request for AED should be placed through the AED Program
         Coordinator by submitting the appropriate documents. The organization requesting
         procurement of an AED must submit, in writing, justification of need for the medical
         device. The letter of justification (Attachment 8) must include: name of the unit
         requesting the AED, building number and location the AED will be placed, and the
         appointment of primary and alternate PAD Site Coordinators. The installation PAD

            program manager will then submit the PAD request to the ERAA board for MDG
            approval to process the purchase.
            1.3.7.5.3. AEDs owned by non-MTF units will be maintained on the DMLSS
            account.
        1.3.7.6. May consider coordination of traumatic stress response debriefing sessions for
        all individuals involved in providing assistance in an emergency.
     1.3.8. Lay Rescue Responders.
        1.3.8.1. Will be identified by the AED Site Coordinator and will be trained and maintain
        certification in adult Basic Life Support with AED use through a nationally recognized
        organization.
        1.3.8.2. Notify their respective AED Site Coordinator immediately after an event when
        an AED is used.
        1.3.8.3. Complete Event Summary Sheet and forward to AED Site Coordinator
        immediately (within 24-hours) after an AED is used.
        1.3.8.4. Follow the protocol in an emergency situation as depicted in the AED Treatment
        Algorithm (Attachment 3).
1.4. Response Plan:
     1.4.1. All units and organizations participating in the Seymour Johnson AFB PAD Program
     will devise response plans that describe the method of response in the event of a suspected
     acute cardiac arrest. The response plan will use the format outlined in (Attachment 9).
     1.4.2. Each individual unit must have its initial Unit PAD Response Plan Memorandum
     approved by the PAD Medical Director prior to activation of the PAD Program within their
     unit. Thereafter, an annual update of the response plan will be submitted to the PAD Medical
     Director.
1.5. Maintenance:
     1.5.1. MDSS/SGSM will serve as the point of contact for site coordinators and the
     manufacturer representatives concerning any problems with AEDs. 4 MDSS/SGSM will
     calibrate all AEDs and conduct an initial and annual preventative maintenance on all AEDs
     located on Seymour Johnson AFB and tenant units serviced by the 4 FW IAW
     manufacturer’s specifications and guidelines. 4 MDSS/SGSM will inform the owning
     organization unit AED coordinators, and the base Medical Director of any discrepancies
     noted during inspections and will remove unserviceable equipment until it is once again
     serviceable. If an AED has to be replaced, 4 MDSS/SGSM will supply the organization with
     a loaner AED until the procurement of a new device has been accomplished. NOTE: The
     unit will not be required to submit another request in the event of replacement of defective
     equipment.
     1.5.2. Generally, AEDs are stand-alone, maintenance-free equipment with a battery life
     of two years. Each unit with an AED is responsible for the cost of supplies, batteries, or any
     maintenance repairs.
SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBI41-101 19 MARCH 2014                                                         7


   1.5.3. If, for any reason, a PAD device malfunctions at any time during use, call Biomedical
   Equipment Maintenance immediately at DSN 722-1877 to report the failure.
1.6. Establishing/Reviewing AED Placement. The following items should be addressed when
establishing or reviewing AED placement at any location:
   1.6.1. Evaluate decision to implement PAD program (risk/benefit evaluation).
   1.6.2. Review data of previous sudden cardiac arrests to identify at-risk situations.
   1.6.3. Consider workforce and visitor demographics (i.e.: older workers and visitors are at
   higher risk for cardiac arrest).
   1.6.4. Consider special needs (i.e.: strenuous work/exercise, electrical shock risk, and other
   significant physical stress areas are higher risk areas for cardiac arrest).
   1.6.5. Select area to place and store AED(s) and additional supplies. The location should be
   climate-controlled and have immediate access to a telephone to contact emergency medical
   services in the event of a medical emergency.
   1.6.6. Funding and Purchase of AED(s):
      1.6.6.1. Units are required to establish a medical account to purchase AEDs.           All
