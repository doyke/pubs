SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision has removed legacy systems Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR), Programmable
Indicator Data Processor (PIDP), AN/TPX-42 Interrogator System, and Digital Bright Radar
 2                                                     434ARWI21-107 14 SEPTEMBER 2011


Indicator Tower Equipment (DBRITE) and added new systems (Standard Terminal Automation
Replacement System (STARS) and Digital Airport Surveillance Radar (DASR) affecting
attachments 3, 4, and 5.
1. Scope: Establishes the responsibilities, coordination, and procedures for reporting
interruptions, malfunctions, NO-NOTICE Preventative Maintenance, and response times for
outages in work centers under the 434th CS ATC and Landing Systems (ATCALS) maintenance
responsibility. It also establishes the restoration priorities. Whenever an operational mission
requirement dictates an amendment of the Preventive Maintenance Inspection Preventative
Maintenance Inspection (PMI) schedule for ATCALS in (See Attachment 2), the Chief of
Maintenance (COM) will make the request for change to the Airfield Operations Manager
(AOM).
2. Scheduled Maintenance:
     2.1. Prior to releasing equipment for scheduled PMI’s, (See Attachment 2), ensure the
     following actions have been completed:
        2.1.1. ATC Watch Supervisor (WS)/Controller-in-Charge (CIC) will access the current
        and forecasted weather conditions. Current weather will be reported at a 3000ft ceiling
        and 5 miles visibility. Forecasted weather will be at least 3000ft ceiling and 5 miles
        visibility thru the period the requested ATCALS equipment is to be withdrawn from
        service.
        2.1.2. WS/CIC will assess the current and known forecasted traffic conditions within
        Grissom’s delegated airspace thru the forecasted PMI period.
        2.1.3. After release WS/CIC will advise effected agencies the ATCALS equipment has
        been removed from service.
        2.1.4. No more than one ATCALS facility will be normally released for PMI’s at a given
        time. The exception to this are the Instrument Landing System (ILS) facilities installed at
        opposite ends of the runway.
3. Unscheduled Maintenance:
     3.1. Significant downtime request of ATCALS equipment that will impair the flying mission
     will be coordinated as far in advance as possible with the Airfield Operations Manager or in
     his absence the Air Traffic Manager (ATM) during normal duty hours Monday-Friday,
     0730L to 1530L. This will allow the AOM/ATM to sufficiently coordinate the request and
     obtain Operations Group (OG/CC) approval. The following should be provided if known:
     ATCALS system affected, estimated start work day, estimated time the ATCALS equipment
     will be removed from service, and if Flight Check will be required.
     3.2. Non-significant downtime request of ATCALS equipment that will not impair flying
     mission - the requested equipment has a redundancy (backup equipment to take the place of
     the primary equipment) and/or the ATCALS equipment can be brought back to service in a
     moment notice - will be coordinated with WS/CIC and released at the discretion of the
     WS/CIC.
     3.3. Maintenance request for significant ATCALS downtime outside normal duty hours will
     be coordinated thru the Watch Supervisor/Controller-in-Charge (WS/CIC). ATC WS/CIC
     will give notice of the specific equipment requested and downtime to the appropriate
434ARWI21-107 14 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                               3


   agencies i.e.; Command Post for relay to 434th OG or designated representative. ATC
   WS/CIC will defer maintenance downtime request until approved by the OG/CC or
   designated authority.
   3.4. Emergency conditions that warrant the immediate withdraw of Grissom’s ATCALS
   equipment will be immediately reported to WS/CIC through the COM with the final
   determination and coordination to shut down the ATCALS equipment by ATC.
   3.5. When manpower or other limitation to resources does not permit simultaneous repair of
   multiple ATCALS outages, the restoral priorities listed in (See Attachment 4) will be
   adhered to unless otherwise specifically coordinated between the COM or a designated
   representative and the customer.
   3.6. The RAPCON is designated as the primary Notices-to-Airmen (NOTAM) monitor
   facility and serves as the focal point for all information concerning ATCALS performance.
   ATC WS/CIC will advise Airfield Management for NOTAM dissemination and/or airfield
   advisory, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) affected agencies if approved.
   3.7. To maximum extent possible, planned interruptions of ATCALS will be scheduled
   during periods which ensure the least impact to operational flying activities.
4. Responsibilities and Coordination:
   4.1. ATC will:
      4.1.1. The WS/CIC will ensure that the equipment outage and completion of the
      requested equipment downtime is appropriately logged in the RAPCON and/or Control
      Tower Facility Event Log.
      4.1.2. The WS/CIC will notify ATM when equipment identified in paragraph 4.1.1.
      returns to operational service.
      4.1.3. When requests for unscheduled ATCALS equipment downtime are denied such as
      for less than adequate weather, the WS/CIC will ensure that the ATCALS technician is
      afforded an alternate time table and that time is coordinated prior as noted above.
      4.1.4. Notify ATM/ATCALS Maintenance of all interruptions/malfunctions of assigned
      equipment/systems that will affect Approach Control Operations (ACO).
      4.1.5. The Supervisor on duty will log out the affected equipment with ATCALS at
      extension 688-4444 Airfield Systems and/or 688-3135 (Radar) (after normal duty hours
      follow equipment restoration priority list in (See Attachment 4) and call back procedures
      in (See Attachment 6). Immediately report the shutdown or failure of ATCALS to the
      NOTAM dispatch center (Airfield Management) to include RAPCON/TOWER published
      frequencies, Air Traffic Information Systems (ATIS), etc. Notify the ATM and Airfield
      Operations when equipment identified in paragraph 4.1. returns to operational service if a
      NOTAM is in effect.
      4.1.6. Coordinate the release of ATCALS equipment that will affect approach control
      operations with the opposite facility prior to releasing the equipment to maintenance.
      4.1.7. Notify the duty weather observer of any outage or suspected problems with the
      FMQ-19 digital winds readout equipment.
4                                                    434ARWI21-107 14 SEPTEMBER 2011


       4.1.8. Verify equipment outage status with ATCALS at extension 688-4444 (Airfield
       Systems) and/or 688-3135 (Ground Radar) on weekdays, except holidays, between 0730-
       0830 local.
       4.1.9. Report immediately the shutdown or failure of Radar Approach Control
       (RAPCON) primary frequencies and/or DASR to the tower and Chicago Air Routine Air
       Traffic Control Center (ARTCC).
       4.1.10. Notify all affected facilities when wind velocity is forecasted or sustained at 55
       knots or greater. Watch supervisor will implement procedures for free-wheeling the
       DASR antenna (See Attachment 2).
    4.2. ATCALS will:
       4.2.1. Ensure when the ATCALS facility is removed from service, the identification
       feature is turned off.
       4.2.2. Coordinate approvals with the WS/CIC, who will in-turn notify other affected
       facilities if necessary when:
          4.2.2.1. Maintenance requires shutdown of an operation position.
          4.2.2.2. Equipment modifications or changes in technical data, which affect operator
          use of the equipment, are accomplished.
          4.2.2.3. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight check with ―monitors‖ will
          render ILS out of service.
       4.2.3. Radar maintenance will advise the RAPCON WS/CIC watch Supervisor or
       Controller when a situation precludes continued operation of DASR.
       4.2.4. If a delay occurs between when the approval is given for shutdown and the time
       the NAVAID actually will be shutdown, the ATCALS maintenance technician will again
       verify with the WS/CIC concurrence prior to taking the affected ATCALS facility off the
       air.
       4.2.5. Maintenance technicians will contact the affected ATC facility prior to beginning
       maintenance on any online ATCALS equipment. Prior coordination is also required for
       maintenance activities, which may interfere with online equipment, i.e., testing spare
       radios on an operational frequency. No work may begin until ATC is contacted and
       releases the equipment to maintenance.
       4.2.6. Maintenance technicians will inform the appropriate facility when maintenance
       action has been stopped/completed. The appropriate facility then determines the
       operational status of equipment and will notify ATCALS as soon as equipment operation
       is verified. Maintenance will return ATCALS component to ATC NLT the expiration of
       the scheduled downtime. This will ensure sufficient time for ATC checks and
       alignments.
       4.2.7. Radar maintenance will advise tower prior to making adjustments to the Digital
       Airport Surveillance Radar (DASR), which may affect the performance of the TDW
       (Tower Display Workstation), unless safety of flight requires immediate action.
434ARWI21-107 14 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              5


       4.2.8. ATCALS Chief of Maintenance will coordinate ATCALS flight inspection
       activities and is the central point of contact for flight inspections and/or operational
       evaluation deficiencies. If flight check is going to be required following a maintenance
       activity, notify the ATM as far in advance as possible so appropriate scheduling can be
       accomplished with the OG, and Flight Inspection Field Office (FIFO).
       4.2.9. Airfield Systems will coordinate with the tower and perform navigational aid
       evacuation (bailout) alarms checks in (See Attachment 7).
       4.2.10. ATCALS maintenance will respond to outages IAW response time requirements
       listed in (See Attachment 5). In addition, specific instructional requirements are as
       follows:
5. ATC, Command Post, Airfield Management, and Weather Station: Normal ATCALS
duty hours are defined as Monday through Friday, with core duty hours as 0900 – 1500 local
(except for holidays). Specific start and stop times vary for each functional area. For after

     PROCEDURES FOR FREE-WHEELING/STOPPING THE DASR ANTENNA

A3.1. Ensure that the Radar Control Panel (RCP) has control.
A3.2. Determine which channels of the Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR), Secondary
Surveillance Radar (SSR), and Site Control Monitoring Interface (SCDI) are selected.
   A3.2.1. Look at the SELECTED buttons/indicators.
      A3.2.1.1. Green Light-Emitting Diode LED beneath A: Channel A is selected.
      A3.2.1.2. Green LED beneath B: Channel B is selected.
A3.3. Place the unselected channels of the PSR, SSR, and SCDI into Maintenance mode.
   A3.3.1. Press the PSR/SSR/ACDI A or B buttons for the unselected channels.
      A3.3.1.1. LEDs will change to amber.
A3.4. Place the unselected channels of the PSR, SSR, and SCDI into Maintenance mode.
   A3.4.1. Press the PSR/SSR/SCDI A or B buttons for the unselected channels.
      A3.4.1.1. LEDs will change to amber. NOTE: If any of the channel LEDs illuminates
      red instead of amber or green, continue with the procedure. Even though red indicates a
      failed channel, the antenna can still be shut down.
A3.5. Press the Antenna button.
   A3.5.1. LED will change from green to red, indicating the antenna has stopped rotating.
      A3.5.1.1. Several buttons on the RCP will illuminate red, because stopping the antenna
      causes both the PSR and SSR transmitters to shut down.
