                                          Chapter 2

                              RDS/D035G FUNCTIONALITY

2.1. Overview.
2.1.1. This chapter provides guidance and direction for operation of the Air Force Materiel
Reutilization Disposition System. D035G RDS provides AFMC materiel management personnel
the capability to identify AF assets for the purpose of: reutilization, saving/disposing, or
transferring to DLADS for use by other organizations.
   2.1.2. D035G RDS system provides a workflow mechanism which maintains historical data
   for use by management, auditors, and investigative agencies. The system is a secure web-
   based application with automated on-line “workbaskets”. Workbaskets are configured based
   on the user’s profile and role. Each of these users can select which items to be released, or
   can release the entire list without reviewing it. Completing work in the workbaskets will
   facilitate the routing and approval/disapproval process for three workflows: ERL, FES, and
   Reclamation.
   2.1.3. Assets selected for disposal will be approved by the appropriate IMS and ES
   supervisory levels prior to being transferred to DLADS.
2.2. Stock Control System and D035G RDS System.
   2.2.1. RDS data flow is a “PUSH” down workflow process that requires users to conduct a
   time-sensitive review. The first-level supervisor must reassign workbaskets of users that are
   unavailable and would cause an impact to the completion of work IAW Table 2.1
   2.2.2. Users must log-in at a minimum every 30 days to prevent your account from being
   DISABLED. Disabled user account hinders the completion of time-sensitive work and
   results in delinquent reviews. RDS users that no longer requires system access must
   delete/terminate their RDS workflow account, see paragraph 1.3.3.6.1. for required action.
   2.2.3. RDS provides a log-in dialogue screen/workload pop-up notice capability to users
   with pending workload in the workbasket.
   2.2.4. The system maintains a record of assets and requirements for ERL, FES, and
   Reclamation Utilization processes under the Work In Progress (WIP) Menu until the
   workload is reviewed.
       2.2.4.1. RDS receives, reviews, releases workflow processes on wholesale cataloged
       items with national stock numbers.
       2.2.4.2. The induction of the latest computation data will archive existing in-process
       work flow activities; however, items in suspended status will not be archived.
       2.2.4.3. A “Helps” link (system tutorial) and system operation information is available.
       A “Training” and “Simulation” module is located within the “Helps” hyperlink function.
       2.2.4.4. The WIP list. All users have visibility of items currently in the system for
       FES/ERL/Reclamation based on the assigned profile, the available categories are: New,
       Overage, Disapproved, Suspended, Recall, and Rework.
 8                                                            AFMCMAN23-5V3 9 JUNE 2014


     2.2.5. Workflow Recall.        Users have the ability to recall Interchangeability and
     Substitutability (I&S) subgroup master NSN from any subsequent user’s workflow
     workbasket during the ERL review while in the workbasket of the approving/coordinating
     official. Items cannot be recalled once finalized.
        2.2.5.1. A notice will display, “NIIN no longer available in workflow” if the NIIN has
        been processed and exited workflow.
        2.2.5.2. A notice will display, “Recalled item is not in your workflow path” if the NIIN
        has not been processed and exited workflow.
        2.2.5.3. A notice will display, “Item is already in your workbasket” if you try to recall an
        item as the current user of the item.
     2.2.6. RDS Options:
        2.2.6.1. A History Option is available for User’s to view previous actions/item history.
        2.2.6.2. The Workbasket Loan Option is used to conduct reviews when leaves, TDYs,
        etc will impact working baskets. The supervisor will contact the PD Monitor or RDS
        OPR for the LOAN function to ensure the work in the workbasket is completed.
        2.2.6.3. Approval Range is the approval/disapproval levels at various supervisory levels
        on the actions that need to be taken by the IMs/MMs/ESs. RDS allows each site to
        determine/designate supervisor approval signature level.
        2.2.6.4. The requirements data maintained in RDS are organized within the “ORDERS”
        function and are used to determine or identify FES and Reclamation activity.
     2.2.7. Timeout Table. The Timeout Table defines workload requirements. When workflow
     exceeds the prescribed Timeout Table timeline, it results in an overage status that requires
     immediate attention (see Table 2.1) for the standard.

                       EXCESS REVIEW GENRAL INFORMATION

3.1. AF wholesale inventory
   3.1.1. See Table 3.1. The AF wholesale inventory is stratified into one of four categories.

Table 3.1. Stratification Inventory
Potential Reutilization Disposal   Potential reutilization (excess) is the quantity of an item
                                   above all authorized levels for which final determination as
                                   excess has not been made.
Contingency Retention Stock        Contingency retention stock is retained for specific
                                   contingencies. It is stock for which there is no predictable
                                   demand or quantifiable requirement. CRS is stock above the
                                   AAO and above the ERS level.
Economic Retention Stock           Economic retention stock has no present requirement;
                                   however, it has been determined that it is more economical
                                   to retain the stock for future peacetime use instead of
                                   satisfying possible future needs through procurement.
Approved Acquisition Objective     The approved acquisition objective is held to support
(AAO)                              operating levels and war reserve requirements
                                   (apportionment year (ay), budget year (by), plus lead-time (2
                                   to 3 years)).
3.2. Excess Review List (ERL) Process.
   3.2.1. ERL Process is one of RDS’s workflow functions (ERL/FES/Reclamation) that allow
   users to review, dispose, or retain assets that have been identified as potential excess by
   D200A for secondary items and D200C for primary equipment items on a quarterly basis.
   ERL is designed to review only depot/wholesale reported items and not Base Excess Report
   Listing items.
   3.2.2. The ERL is a “push” process within SCS. Using the latest depot reported, Purpose
   Code “09” assets position; it provides the capability to identify potential excess to determine
   the amount or quantity that is transferred to DLADS.
       3.2.2.1. The suggested disposal candidates are displayed by the least preferred AF order
       of use within the I&S subgroup family and condition of A-H.
       3.2.2.2. If there is no depot reported Purpose Code “09” inventory available, the NIIN is
       removed from the ERL candidate list.
       3.2.2.3. If partial inventory is available, the ERL will display partial D200A/C disposal
       candidate quantity.
       3.2.2.4. NSN with Acquisition Advice Code (AAC) V/Y terminal items not included in
       the requirements system (D200). Users will take User-initiated disposal actions.
AFMCMAN23-5V3 9 JUNE 2014                                                                     11


      3.2.2.5. The RDS users must conduct a review of the entire candidates ERL for retention
      or disposal. The ERL candidate is obtained under “ASSETS” button and then the drop
      down selection “EXCESS”, “DESIGNATED IM/MM NAME”, and “WORK IN
      PROGRESS”.
3.3. ERL Release Logic.
   3.3.1. RDS compares the Requirements Computations System’s Excess data with the latest
   SCS D035K, “Purpose Code 09” account reported assets postures. If there is no “09”
   reported inventory available at the depot, the NIIN will be removed from the ERL candidates
   list. If partial inventory is available, the ERL will display partial D200A/C disposal
   candidate quantity. If an “A5J Disposal Release Order” transaction occurs prior to the D200
   cycle cutoff date) and prior to the ERL release date (e.g. ERL release date is approximately 3
   months after D200 cycle cutoff date), the NIIN will be removed from the ERL candidate.
   3.3.2. ERL Management Tool Footprint outlines the direction of order of how work flows
   into the RDS workbaskets: AF RDS Functional OPR, Site DPCO (Including Prime
   IM/MM), Excess Product Directorate (PD) Monitor, IM/MM, ES, Designated Supervisor(s),
   and RDS ERL Workflow Process.
3.4. RDS Workbaskets.
   3.4.1. The RDS workbasket serves as a preliminary selection page, allowing users to select
   what type of item they wish to review. If a displayed category contains any number greater
   than zero, a VIEW button appears on the right side of the page. If the number is zero, the
   VIEW button will be absent, which means there is no item to be reviewed. To preclude
   inclusion in following quarterly excess receipt/review/release, the designated users must
   review all ERL candidates and code each for retention or disposal prior to RDS submission
   and processing. The ERL workbasket access allows for three options to entered:
      3.4.1.1. Pop-Up Notice to Access Workbasket.
      3.4.1.2. Access Workbasket from Homepage.
      3.4.1.3. Displays Total NIINs in Workbasket for Review.
3.4.2. The ERL release quarterly feed from D200A with semi-annual feed from D200C (31 Mar
updates and 30 Sep Comps). The AF Functional RDS OPR initiate the ERL process will:
      3.4.2.1. Pull Insurance (INS)/ Numeric Stockage Objective (NSO) items from Interactive
      Requirement Information Services (IRIS).
      3.4.2.2. Send a random number of INS/NSO NIINs to the D200A OPR for validation.
      3.4.2.3. Forward INS/NSO items to RDS Contract System Administrators for loading
      into the quarterly COMP/ERL.
      3.4.2.4. Randomly validate RDS Contract System Administrators load of INS/NSO
      items.
      3.4.2.5. Send an electronic release notification to DPCOs.
      3.4.2.6. Align Asset Cutoff Date to the last day of the month of the COMP cycle.
      3.4.2.7. Release ERL/COMP Workflow Initiation data to Site DPCOs.
  12                                                      AFMCMAN23-5V3 9 JUNE 2014


    3.4.3. Site DPCOs conduct the following steps:
       3.4.3.1. Approximately two weeks prior to the quarterly ERL release, Site DPCOs
       receive a pop-up screen notice “Workflow Initiation Date Pending” post logging in.
       3.4.3.2. The Site DPCOs use the notice to set an anticipated ERL initiation date on the
       Assets/Excess/Initiation drop-down menu. This triggers Users to complete reviewing on
       all remaining ERL NIINs and prep for the new forthcoming ERL release.
       3.4.3.3. Upon receipt of the “Ready to Release” email notification from the RDS OPR at
       Wright Patterson AFB; Site DPCOs take proper ERL Initiation Pending actions to bring
       the ERL data from D200A/C to the DPCO’s staging area within SCS.
       3.4.3.4. The Site DPCO accepts the initiation pending action that is preceded by the
       Workflow Initiation action which introduces ERL workflow into the DPCO’s
       workbasket.
       3.4.3.5. Once the candidates are initiated and moved to the DPCO’s workbasket, the Site
       DPCO sorts/removes AF Secondary Inventory Control Activity (SICA) and
       Nonconsumable Item Materiel Support Code (3, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 12) items.
       3.4.3.6. The DPCO releases the remainder of the ERL data to the assigned workflow PD
       monitor. The ERL Time Stamp starts with the release from the DPCO to the PD
       monitors’ workbasket. An email notification is sent from the DPCO to the PD monitor’s
       workbasket with a suspense date.
       3.4.3.7. Any transactions that did not flow to the PD monitor will flow to the Site
       DPCO’s on-screen 30-day error log workbasket for managing, (see Table 3.2).

1. Note: Asterisk means ‘Yes” and Blank means “No”.
   3.4.4. The designated PD Monitor reviews/releases the ERL workbasket to the next
   subordinate IM/MM.
   3.4.5. The workbasket is a preliminary selection allowing PD monitors to choose the type of
   item they wish to review and release to the IM/MM’s workflow. If there are no NSNs for
   release, the “View” button will not be present.
   3.4.6. The designated IM receives the ERL workflow from the PD Monitor, but will not
   know the workflow is in his/her workbasket until he/she logs into the SCS. To ensure
   proper management/processing of ERL/FES/Reclamation workflows, the IM must log into
   the SCS.
   3.4.7. The IM/MM will review the entire workflow and code NIINS for disposal or retention
   decisions that are forwarded to the ES for review.
3.5. Disposal Quantity.
   3.5.1. The system suggested disposal quantity must be the same as D200A/C’s potential
   excess quantity less D200 deferred disposal quantity. If the RDS recommended disposal
   quantity does not match, the ES must perform research and provide documentation or
   rationale for not disposing of the entire D200A excess quantity to the IM/MM. The D200A
   documentation must be annotated on the D200A paper copy for the audit trail. Prior to the
   ERL review, all D200A/C final computations that are potential reutilization (excess) items
   must be reviewed, documented with the intended action, coordinated amongst the IM/MM,
   ES, and appropriate level of approval IAW AFMCMAN 23-1, Requirements for Secondary
   Items             (D200A,D200N)               (located           at         http://www.e-

   publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMCMAN23-4.pdf .
   3.5.2. Exception: If the item requires a DEMIL disposal action or end item reclamation,
   IMs/MMs WILL NOT take disposal action thru RDS. Process the ERL disposal quantity
   with “zero” on the RDS ERL review screen in order to close out the workflow and then
   create the appropriate offline disposal action.
3.6. DEMIL Codes F, G, and P.
   3.6.1. All DEMIL Code “F” items must have special disposition instructions in the Army
   Electronic      Product      Support      (AEPS)      “TULSA”       database,   located     at
   https://tulsa.tacom.army.mil/index.cfm. During the ERL review, the IM will get a pop-up
   notice for the special instruction validation at the AEPS link. The IM must contact the ES for
   validity.
      3.6.1.1. The ES determines if the correct demilitarization code has been assigned to
      assets using the excess detail view screen.
      3.6.1.2. If the correct demilitarization code is assigned, the ES will record on the excess
      detail view screen: states that the code is correct and identifies an AFMC Form 206,
      Temporary Work request is required.
      3.6.1.3. If assigned incorrectly, the ES will record that the code is incorrect along with
      any other comments on the excess detail view screen, identify an AF Form 86, Request
      for Cataloging Data/Action is required and input a date for actions taken (allows item to
      leave the ES’ workbasket).
   3.6.2. Demilitarization code “G” requires inert certification; if not attached to the item,
   forward to maintenance with AFMC Form 206.
   3.6.3. Upon completion of the AFMC Form 206, the maintenance activity will turn in the
   residue, segregated by NSN, to the local materiel management activity. LRS/Materiel
   Management activity will complete the disposal turn-in process. The Disposal Turn-in
   Document (DTID) will contain a certification and authorized signature to the effect that
   declassification or demilitarization has been accomplished. Reference AFMAN 23-122,
   Materiel Management Procedures.
   3.6.4. Component parts that have valid requirements will be reclaimed from excess end
   items prior to disposal. Upon completion of the required declassification, demilitarization, or
   reclamation action, excess classified and hazardous items will be processed according to AFI
   31-401, Information Security Program Management, and AFMAN 23-122.
   3.6.5. Demilitarization code “P” is required for Security Classified items on the Munitions
   List. (NOTE: This code will NOT be assigned to Classified Ammunitions).
   3.6.6. For end items requiring reclamation, process an inter-condition transfer to transfer all
   the items from their present condition to condition code "P."
3.7. Controlled Inventory Item Code (CIIC) Security Code 9 Items.
   3.7.1. Cryptological/Cryptographic capable (CIIC 9) inventories that are disposed through
   RDS are placed in suspended supply conditions. A disposal action always require disposition
   instructions from the National Security Agency for DEMIL action on an AFMC Form 206.
AFMCMAN23-5V3 9 JUNE 2014                                                                  15


   The assets are not turned into DLADS on the original NSN/Part Number/Nomenclature that
   can be identified with the original Crypto properties.
   3.7.2. All CIIC 9 assets require special DEMIL actions from the ES prior to releasing to
   DLADS and are identified in the Supply/DLADS system on a locally generated NSN/Part
   number.
   3.7.3. The ES is required to reject the RDS disposal action on all CIIC 9 items and provide
   an explanation.
   3.7.4. The IM/MM must input zero disposal quantity and provide a comment to close out the
   ERL review workflow and document the intended action (e.g., AFMC Form 206) in D200A
   paper copy.
3.8. Nuclear Weapon-Related Materiel (NWRM).
   3.8.1. ERL and NWRM. The IM/MM and ES receives a pop-up notice/dialog in the
   workbasket if the item is a NWRM items within RDS.
      3.8.1.1. IMs or ESs can interrogate the RDS system by NSN. Log-in and click on the
      “Assets” tab, then “Interrogations”, and lastly “Stock Number Interrogatin” to view all
      NWRM items.
      3.8.1.2. RDS displays the NWRM indicator on the ERL history (historical reference
      detail page).
      3.8.1.3. The IM/MM must input zero disposal quantity, provide a comment, and take the
      appropriate disposal action IAW AFI 20-110, Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel
      Management at (http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFI20-110.pdf)
      for NWRM data flowing into the ERL.
3.9. Automatic Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) Items.
   3.9.1. Certain restrictions are inherent to the system design for User-initiated and ERL
   disposal actions. The following examples are not inclusive:
      3.9.1.1. Federal Supply Group “70” or Materiel Management Aggregation Code
      (MMAC) “JZ” ADPE requires a Certification of Hard Drive Disposition (Degaussing)
      IAW Disposition of unclassified DoD Computer Hard Drives and, AFMAN 33-282,
      Computer Security (COMPUSEC).
      3.9.1.2. The ES must ensure the Federal Stock Class (FSC) and MMAC are properly
      cataloged prior to taking disposal actions.
   3.9.2. The IM/MM must provide a clear text memo on the Disposal Addendum Sheet prior
   to DLADS transfer. The ES must take the appropriate offline disposal action.
3.10. End Item Reclamation.
   3.10.1. The IM/MM/ES will consider possible needs for the component parts associated with
   the end item reclamation process IAW AFMCI 23-111, Reclamation of Air Force Property
   Chapter 9, located at (http://www.e-publish.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMCI23-
   111.pdf). If End Item Reclamation is feasible, the IM/MM/ES must document the intended
   action on D200A paper copy.
 16                                                          AFMCMAN23-5V3 9 JUNE 2014


   3.10.2. The IM/MM/ES must take end item disposal reclamation offline and will input zero
   disposal quantity in the RDS ERL review screen in order to exit the RDS. IM/MM/ES will
   then take a manual disposal action.
   3.10.3. The IM/MM has the option to override (increase/decrease) the RDS suggested
   disposal quantity. If the decision is to retain/disposal all or part of the RDS system suggested
   disposal quantities, the IM/MM must enter appropriate Disposal Reason Codes shown below.
   The ES must provide justification/rationale to the IM/MM for the action which must be
   included in the comment text box and should be consistent with the D200A paper copy
   documentation.

   3.11.2. The ES must perform research and provide justification/rationale to the IM/MM to
   address the difference. If the ERL recommended quantity is not adequate enough to dispose
   of the D200 excess. Annotate the justification on the D200A paper copy or D200C on-line
   notepad.
AFMCMAN23-5V3 9 JUNE 2014                                                                      17


3.12. Recall Option. Prior to the final process, the recall option is available for retrieving the
action during the ERL review. Utilized this option in the Workflow Recall Menu.
3.13. User Initiated.
   3.13.1. This option is available for IMs/MMs to take disposal actions within RDS under the
   “Assets” menu button and drop-down selections “Excess, User Initiated Disposal”. All
   assets must relate directly to an assigned RDS wholesale IM/MM-ES-Supervisory “string” in
   order to progress through the workflow processes.
   3.13.2. RDS only process items with Supply Condition Codes A, B, C, D, F, G, and H.
   Assets that are already in the system will reject and here are some reasons for taking user
   initiated disposal actions within RDS:
       3.13.2.1. IM/MM may opt to take early disposal actions prior to the ERL release.
       3.13.2.2. IM/MM may dispose of NIINS not computed in D200 system: terminated
       (AAC-Y), non-stocked centrally procured (AAC-J) and semi-active no replacement items
       (AAC-X).
       3.13.2.3. Non-cataloged/Non-definitive control number and modification kit items.
           3.13.2.3.1. Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO kits) will not be disposed
           inside of RDS.
           3.13.2.3.2. TCTO kits will be disposed of using an AFMC Form 206.
           3.13.2.3.3. TCTO kits will be broken down prior to going to DLADS.
   3.13.3. User initiated disposal transactions result in “A0A/VD” transactions within RDS to
   format an A5J transaction (Disposal Release Order) in D035A to the storage sites.
   3.13.4. The disposal document number is made up of: Department of Defense Activity
   Address Code (DoDAAC) 1-6 (SOS of the item should be indicated), Julian Date 7-10
   (YDDMM), and Serial Number 11-14 (User-initiated the first position will be a “Y”. If
   system initiated the first position will be a “Z”).

                                          Chapter 4

                             FRONT END SCREENING (FES)

4.1. Front End Screening.
   4.1.1. The FES “push” process offers worldwide asset availability, time-sensitive and
   notifications to the item manager. The FES notification passes to RDS on a daily basis,
   during the sequential flow, users must review the workflow within the timeframes
   established in the Timeout Table (see Table 2.1).
   4.1.2. The RDS generated FES “push” process located under the “ORDERS” function of the
   RDS Display. As each DLADS receipt is recorded in the DAISY, the FES process identifies
   the wholesale item manager.
      4.1.2.1. The Site FESPCO will release the transaction to the PD Monitors when RDS
      sees DLADS Daisy transaction; RDS checks the reported assets against the D200A/C
      requirement positions and J018R Pre and Post award data. If there are due-in assets and a
      requirement, a FES candidate will be created and placed in the Site FESPCO’s workflow.
      4.1.2.2. The IM/MM and ES receive a pop-up notice/dialog box in the workbasket if the
      item is a NWRM item.
      4.1.2.3. FESPCO and PD Monitor’s must release the FES referral candidates to the
      designated users for review.
          4.1.2.3.1. The IM/MM will conduct a review in the designated workbasket and make
          a determination to “Accept or Reject” assets. Justification for rejection or acceptance
          of assets having a valid requirement will be required when system prompts (pop-up
          message).
          4.1.2.3.2. The IM/MM will not accept for return unless there is a valid requirement
          and documentation obtained in the D200A/C computation.
          4.1.2.3.3. The work will flow to the ES and supervisor for approval or disapproval.
          Approvals of accepted FES transactions result in the release of transactions from RDS
          to D035A. Disapprovals of FES transactions result in the work flowing back to the
          IM’s/MM’s workbasket for appropriate closure actions.
      4.1.2.4. The DTID originated at the owning (requisitioning) site.
          4.1.2.4.1. The user states the original disposal action was “Preventable” or “Non
          Preventable” by making the appropriate selection.
          4.1.2.4.2. Enters the reason in the free text field and “Comments/Endorsement”
          section. The free text box is located at the bottom of the screen. The system stores
          the codes N (Non Preventable) or P (Preventable) with the I&S subgroup master NSN
          record and makes them available for HQ AFMC program analysis to generate the
          Disposal Withdrawal/Coral Reduce report.
      4.1.2.5. Note: The “Push” process prevents requisitioning of quantities greater than the
      displayed requirements position or the due-in quantity.
AFMCMAN23-5V3 9 JUNE 2014                                                                      19


4.2. User Initiated FES (“Pull” Process).
   4.2.1. The RDS “ORDERS” button and drop down selection “FES”, “USER INITIATED”
   provides the user with the capability to directly query DLADS stock by FSC, NIIN or
   NOUN.
       4.2.1.1. Input the rationale for the withdrawal reason (preventable or non-preventable) as
       it appears in the comments section assigned to the item manager.
       4.2.1.2. Only item managers can initiate requisitions for DLADS held materiel.
       4.2.1.3. The IM/MM will see the screen showing quantity and condition of assets
       available.
       4.2.1.4. To generate the FES action.
          4.2.1.4.1. The IM/MM will select ‘SUBMIT’ and then review the FES IM’s/MM’s
          workbasket.
          4.2.1.4.2. Post IM’s/MM’s review/release, FES transaction will flow to the managing
          ES/Supervisor for review.
          4.2.1.4.3. ES approve/accepted FES action results in release of a transaction from
          RDS to D035A.
          4.2.1.4.4. Disapprovals are returned to IMs/MMs workbaskets for appropriate
          closure.
   4.2.2. When a requirement is not identified and a candidate is not produced, the DLADS
   transaction is retained in RDS for manual interrogation and User initiated action if desired.
4.3. Demilitarization of Excess Items.
   4.3.1. Activities engaged in the processing of weapon systems for transfer, donation, static
   display, and disposal will comply with demilitarization policies and procedures prescribed in
   AFI 23-101 and AFI 20-110 for NWRM assets.
   4.3.2. The review and coordination of the computed excess is accomplished during the
   requirements computation (D200A/C) reviewed/documentation or during the
   reviewing/coding of the computed excess within RDS. A coordinated effort among the
   IMs/MMs, ESs, and appropriate supervisory levels is required by the RDS workflow logic.
   4.3.3. The ES must coordinate on all excess review NSNs coded for disposal or retention
   decisions forwarded by the IMs/MMs to the ESs. In addition, the ES must validate the
   DEMIL and CIIC codes and initiate any required cataloging actions to correct the codes.
   4.3.4. Pending cataloging action will result in suspension of RDS activity for the Subgroup
   Master.
       4.3.4.1. The suspension action occurs at the point of last required approval level,
       returning to the IM/MM workbasket.
       4.3.4.2. For suspended items, exit the workflow when cataloging actions are complete.
       4.3.4.3. In circumstances where IM/MM and ES cannot agree on asset disposition action,
       the matter is elevated to the appropriate IM and ES supervisory levels.
 20                                                        AFMCMAN23-5V3 9 JUNE 2014


      4.3.4.4. If the IM or ES does not have sufficient knowledge to review the NSN in
      question, the Program Manager (PM), System Manager (SM), and/or System Engineer(s)
      should be consulted.
   4.3.5. The User may override (increase/decrease) potential reutilization quantities (system
   suggested disposal) via input of a retention quantity. For a partial disposal there must be a
   retention code and a disposal code input to process the transaction.
   4.3.6. To preclude inclusion in future excess review lists, the IM/MM must ensure the
   requirements computation system reflects decisions to retain all or part of a quantity that
   would otherwise compute into potential excess. This may involve assignment of deferred
   disposal codes, adjustments to maintenance factors, or catalog action to reactivate
   inaccurately coded items (e.g., items erroneously defined as terminal items with AAC V, X
   or Y).
   4.3.7. Retention and disposal reason codes are compatible with the application listed and the
   commodity of item being reviewed. Some retention and disposal reason code examples:
   retention or disposal reason codes are compatible with active and obsolete end item
   applications; disposal reason codes are compatible with obsolete end item application;
   disposal reason code denoting disposal authorized because item is consumable unserviceable
   and is applicable to consumable (ERRC Designator XB3 and XF3) items; immediate action
   was taken to reactivate terminal and inactive items that are not coded for disposal.
4.4. RDS Reclamation (Engines and Aircraft).
   4.4.1. Reclamation is one of RDS’ workflow functions (ERL/FES/Reclamation). RDS
   provides the Programmed/Non Programmed Save list as a process and it allows IMs/MMs to
   obtain Air Force managed items from aircrafts/missiles/engines stored at Aerospace
   Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) or other designated sites.          Refer to
   AFMCI 23-111 for Reclamation and End Item Reclamation guidance.
   4.4.2. The Reclamation Program Manager (RPM) serves as the focal point on Reclamation
   matters and generates Programmed/Non Programmed lists as a “Push” process. The
   Programmed/Non Programmed lists are time sensitive (30 calendar days) and users must
   conduct the review IAW Table 2.1.
      4.4.2.1. Upon the release of the list to the Site RPCOs, PD Monitors, IMs, ESs, and
      Supervisors are required to review approval of the Reclamation candidates on the
      ORDERS/RECLAMATION dropdown menu.
      4.4.2.2. The final reviewed/approved items by the first-level supervisor through
      squadron level will be ready to generate AFMC Form 110, Reclamation Requisition.
      4.4.2.3. The Site RPCO generates the AFMC Form 110 and forwards it to the Weapon
      System Reclamation Officer for final RDS closure.
   4.4.3. Programmed Reclamation. The programmed reclamation process allows the IM/MM
   to obtain Air Force managed items by participating in a programmed reclamation project and
   designating assets to be removed from aircraft/missiles or engines stored at AMARG.
   Assets reclaimed from AMARG are removed by maintenance from WSs in AMARG storage.
   4.4.4. Non Programmed Reclamation Save Lists. The non-programmed reclamation save
   list serves as a potential source of component items required to satisfy Air Force
AFMCMAN23-5V3 9 JUNE 2014                                                                  21


  requirements when battle or crash-damaged aircraft or other systems (WSs, aircraft, engines,
  etc.) are considered no longer air worthy and must be reclaimed in-place. This process
  allows the IM/MM to obtain Air Force managed items by participating in a non-programmed
  project to designate assets removal from designated systems. Reclamation is performed by
  base and/or depot maintenance activities.

                                           Chapter 5

       DISPOSITION PROGRAM AND DIRECTED DISPOSAL FREEZE CODES

5.1. Overview. This chapter prescribes guidance for managing the AF disposition program and
directed disposal freeze codes.
5.2. Responsibilities.
   5.2.1. AF RDS Functional OPR Responsibilities.
       5.2.1.1. The AFSC will administer all disposal freeze directives according to procedures.
       5.2.1.2. Serve as the point of contact between ALCs regarding weapon system wide
       disposal freeze notices.
       5.2.1.3. Coordinate on all requests for disposal freezes.
       5.2.1.4. Ensure all required information and substantiation for the freeze are furnished.
       The AF RDS Functional OPR maintains a record of all active freeze notices and
       distributes copies to the appropriate ALC.
   5.2.2. The ALCs must ensure the IM/MM has the latest information on active disposal
   freezes prior to each requirements computation for input or deletion of appropriate codes.
   5.2.3. The recoverable/consumable IM/MM or SM will comply with AFMCMAN 23-1, and
   AFMCMAN 23-4, when updating codes and levels in D200A. This action will preclude
   potential excess records from being passed to the RDS system for items involved in the
   freeze.
   5.2.4. If an item has several applications and all applications are coded "P" (peculiar); all
   Potential Reutilization (PR) quantities above the Economic Retention level will stratify to
   Contingency Retention. However, if one or more of the item applications are coded "P" but
   at least one other application is not coded "P," it will be necessary for the IM/MM to file
   maintain the item to ensure the appropriate excess PR assets are frozen.
   5.2.5. The IM/MM will justify assignment of deferred disposal code “F”, “G”, “M”, or "R"
   to a subgroup master stock number in the requirements data systems.
       5.2.5.1. Attain written approval from the group level commander at the ALC or ESC that
       manages the items for use of these codes.
       5.2.5.2. Retain current written justification for historical and audit purposes.
       Specifications: NSNs must be kept, why, how many, for how long, and why the
       computed Economic Retention level is not sufficient. These deferred codes cause assets
       above the Economic Retention level to stratify into the contingency retention segment of
       the D200N. These assets are part of the retention quantity passed to the RDS system. The
       “F”, “G”, “M”, and “R” code is preferred over Wright Patterson AFB controlled deferred
       disposal codes “C” and “P” because the “F”, “G”, “M”, and “R” is applied to the specific
       NSNs that must be retained.
       5.2.5.3. Assignment of deferred disposal code "C" or "P" causes all assets on purchase
       request to stratify into the contingency retention segment of the Central Secondary Item
AFMCMAN23-5V3 9 JUNE 2014                                                                    23


     Stratification. High level directed weapon system wide freeze codes “C” and “P” takes
     precedence over the IM/MM assigned deferred disposal codes.
     5.2.5.4. These are items with asset quantities that exceed any possible use, considering
     all inventories of end items or aircraft. In these cases, individual decisions will be made
     to dispose of partial or total quantities regardless of a disposal freeze application.
  5.2.6. The IM/MM will provide disposition instructions to any base that reports excess assets
  of items that are affected by disposal freezes.
  5.2.7. The recoverable/consumable IM/MM will review deferred disposal codes according to
  the review schedules in AFMCMAN 23-1. The recoverable/consumable IM/MM will remove
  deferred disposal codes “F”, “G”, “M” and “R” that have served their legitimate purpose and
  are no longer justified. Failure to remove unneeded deferred disposal codes causes excess
  inactive inventory, which can lead to reduced spares funding.
  5.2.8. The equipment IM/MM or SM will comply with the procedures in AFMCMAN 23-4,
  Computation of Requirements for Equipment Items (D039/D200C) for the retention of excess
  assets. This action will preclude potential excess records from being passed to the RDS
  system for items involved in the freeze.
  5.2.9. The HQ AFMC programming activity, in collaboration with the AFMC equipment
  program office at Robins AFB assigns Deferred Disposal Code “R” to primary items that are
  covered by an approved disposal freeze.
  5.2.10. AFSC has the capability in D200F to input a Disposal Freeze Code to a weapon
  system, aircraft engine, application program element code or the NSN of an individual
  equipment item. This will cause Disposal Deferred Code of C or P to be assigned to
  equipment items that have components in Secondary Item Requirements System (SIRS).
  This code cannot be overridden and can only be removed if the D200A from Wright
  Patterson AFB removes the Disposal Freeze Code or if the component items are deleted from
  the end item’s indentures in D200F Applications, Programs and Indentures segment of RMS.
  5.2.11. The equipment IM/MM can, when justified, input a retention additive requirement to
  a subgroup master stock number in the requirements data systems. For historical and audit
  purposes, the IM/MM must retain written justification specifying which NSNs must be kept,
  why, how many, and for how long. Use of a retention additive will cause excess assets to
  stratify into the Directed/Elected to hold retention segment of the D200C Item and Dollar
  Stratification Summary report.
  5.2.12. The equipment IM/MM will review each cycle retention additives and ensure they
  have been deleted once they have served their legitimate purpose and are no longer justified.
  Overuse and failure to remove unnecessary retention additives can cause too much inactive
  inventory to negatively impact warehouse costs and spaces.
  5.2.13. Regardless of a disposal freeze application or the retention additive, disposal action
  may be appropriate for some items. These are items with asset quantities exceeding any
  possible use, considering all inventories of interchangeable or like items. In these cases,
  individual decisions will be made to dispose of partial or total quantities.
  5.2.14. The equipment IM/MM will provide disposition instructions to any base that reports
  excess assets of items that are affected by disposal freezes.
 24                                                           AFMCMAN23-5V3 9 JUNE 2014


5.3. Management Review of Inventory Control Point Controlled Excess Assets.
   5.3.1. Determined excess must be processed to the disposal activity not later than the
   quarter. An exception is when items are suspended due to required DEMIL code changes.
   Pending DEMIL code changes may cause disposal activities to spill over to the next quarter.
   RDS will produce a quarterly Excess Review Listing (ERL) for the Item Manager to review
   for disposal or retention. The ERL will be approved and justified according to the
   determined signature level criteria.
   5.3.2. The aircraft, product, or combat sustainment group will ensure the IM/MM
   accomplishes the required review action no later than the quarter. An exception is when
   items are suspended due to required DEMIL code changes. Pending DEMIL code changes
   may cause disposal activities to spill over to the next quarter. The aircraft, product, or combat
   sustainment group will ensure that necessary revisions and cancellations directed by the
   IMs/MMs are accomplished.
   5.3.3. The success of the AF disposition program is dependent upon the ALC, or Site
   processing all documents produced from one cycle prior to the next quarterly cycle output.
   Management/supervisory attention must be focused toward this accomplishment. The most
   effective means of completing quarterly reviews is to ensure internal self- inspections are
   established and current.
5.4. Freeze/Deferred Disposal Code Notice Criteria.
   5.4.1. Disposal freezes will not be imposed unless fully justified and in the case of new
   programs will be lifted as soon as a firm program is known that can be incorporated into the
   normal requirements computation. The formal written directive will state the expiration date
   for all freezes.
   5.4.2. A disposal freeze may be requested for a weapon system, federal supply class (FSC)
   commodity, or individual NSN. For further guidance on Freeze/Deferred Disposal Code, see
   AFI 23-101 Materiel Management and AFMCMAN 23-1 located at (http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/afmcman23-1.pdf)
   5.4.3. When further justification and substantiation information furnished is incomplete or
   inadequate, the request may be returned to the requesting activity.
   5.4.4. The appropriate site may initiate a request at any time for a formal weapon system
   wide disposal freeze notice, revision, or cancellation.
       5.4.4.1. The requesting organization must provide complete justification IAW
       Paragraph 5.5.1.4.1. of this manual along with an Economic Analysis as outlined in
       Chapter 3 of AFMAN 65-506, Economic Analysis against each NSN.
       5.4.4.2. The requesting organization must identify the source of funding for the storage
       costs associated with the stock retention.
       5.4.4.3. Submit the request through the chain of command and flow to HQ AF/A4L for
       approval.
5.5. Preparation of Disposal Freeze Notice.
AFMCMAN23-5V3 9 JUNE 2014                                                                      25


  5.5.1. The Wright Patterson AFB Functional RDS OPR will coordinate efforts to ensure the
  applicable information is included in each disposal freeze notice for HQ AFMC, and HQ
  USAF:
     5.5.1.1. A disposal freeze control number will include the last four digits of the current
     calendar year, Julian date, office, and a sequence freeze number (beginning with "1" at
     the start of each calendar year). For example, the first control number issued by Wright
     Patterson AFB DPCO in calendar year 2011 on 28 Jan 2011 will have control number
     2011-028-01.
         5.5.1.1.1. A freeze control number that is rescinded, expired, or canceled will not be
         reissued.
         5.5.1.1.2. Any approved revision or extension to a disposal freeze that is not
         rescinded, expired, or canceled will continue to use the freeze control number that
         was originally assigned.
         5.5.1.1.3. The disposal freeze notice directive will contain the following information:
         5.5.1.1.3.1. Property affected: aircraft mission, design, and series (MDS); engine
         type, model, and series; number of aircraft involved; peculiar/common spares;
         Support Equipment (SE); SE spares and FSC/materiel management code.
            5.5.1.1.3.2. Freeze control number.
            5.5.1.1.3.3. Expiration date.
            5.5.1.1.3.4. Attach the requesting organizations signed moratorium, Economic
            Analysis (IAW Chapter 3 of AFMAN 65-506) against each NSN identifying the
            source of funding for the storage costs associated with the stock retention.
     5.5.1.2. The disposal freeze directive for HQ AFMC, HQ USAF or higher level will
     include the following statements or references:
         5.5.1.2.1. “This freeze applies to all AF base excesses reported to HQ AFMC for
         disposition.”
         5.5.1.2.2. “Applicable recoverable/consumables IM/MM will update their deferred
         disposal deferral codes and levels tables.”
         5.5.1.2.3. “All materiel not transferred to disposal is included in this freeze. Disposal
         documents will be canceled.”
         5.5.1.2.4. “This freeze does not apply to obsolete materiel, directed condemned
         items, or materiel transferred to disposal activities.” Items with disposal reason code
         “DD ("DSP/NON-PUB ITEM,” see Table 3.4) or has been approved for this code are
         considered obsolete.
         5.5.1.2.5. “This freeze does apply to obsolete materiel, directed condemned items,
         and materiel located in disposal activities.” If the freeze applies to assets at disposal
         activities, the IM/MM will take immediate action to return needed assets to active
         stock.
  5.5.2. A list of items authorized for immediate transfer to disposal is contained in
  Attachment 3.

Terms
Air Force Security Assistance Cooperation (AFSAC)— That portion of United States security
assistance authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and the Arms Export
Control Act, as amended. This assistance differs from the Military Assistance Program and the
International Military Education and Training Program in that the recipient provides
reimbursable funds.
Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO)— The quantity of an item authorized for peacetime
and wartime requirements to equip and sustain U.S. and friendly forces in accordance with
current DoD policies and plans and with applicable statutes. This quantity will be sufficient to
support other DoD components who use the item as a Secondary Inventory Control Agency.
Condition Code— A codification of the physical appearance and capability of Special Tool and
Special Test Equipment (ST/STE) consisting of one alpha and one numeric position.
Contingency Retention Stock (CRS)— The quantity of an item that is greater than the AAO
and economic retention level but is being retained by management decision. These quantities
normally would stratify as Potential Reutilization.
Economic Retention Stock (ERS)— The quantity of an item’s assets that exceed AAO and are
determined to be more economical to retain for future peacetime issues than to dispose. To
warrant economic retention, an item must have a reasonably predictable demand rate.

End Item— A final combination of end products, component parts, or material ready for its
intended use (e.g., a ship, tank, mobile machine shop, or aircraft).
Potential Reutilization (PR)— Component materiel identified by an item manager for possible
disposal but with potential for reutilization; or materiel that has the potential for being sent by an
item manager to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service for possible reutilization by
another component or by a federal, state, or local governmental agency, or for disposal through
sale to the public.
Primary Inventory Control Activity (PICA)— An organization or activity that is assigned
primary responsibility for the management of the item.
Retention Limit— The maximum quantity of on-hand materiel that will be retained in stock, as
determined by applicable retention rules.
Secondary Inventory Control Activity (SICA)— An organization or activity that is assigned
the secondary responsibility for the management of the item.
Secondary Items— Consumable and reparable items other than principal items.

   GUIDANCE FOR REVIEWING AND COMPUTING RETENTION LEVELS, AND
             PROCESSING WHOLESALE ITEMS TO DISPOSAL

A4.1. The following items, subject to retention limits: Are authorized for transfer to DLADS
upon compliance with the specified guidance. Exclusions must be documented, justified, and
maintained in the NSN folder.
   A4.1.1. ERRC Designator "XF3" unserviceable assets will be transferred to DLADS, unless
   retained by the IM to cover temporary and exceptional situations such as critical item or
   mission capable requirements or for which cataloging action has been initiated to change
   them to recoverable items.
   A4.1.2. Potential reutilization assets applicable to active weapons systems or end items in
   the inventory will be considered for transfer to disposal with the following restriction
       A4.1.2.1. Total quantities of on-hand active assets must not be approved for disposal.
       A4.1.2.2. D200A computes retention levels for INS and NSO items. D200A will use
       default minimum retention levels for INS and NSO items when there has been no usage
       and are no additives or special levels. The assets of INS/NSO items that exceed the
       computed INS/NSO retention level or quantities will be transferred to disposal.
       A4.1.2.3. For recoverable/consumable items with usage in the past two years, used on
       weapon systems over 18 years old, establish an IM file-maintained deferred disposal code
       and level if the D200A computed retention is not sufficient to provide support for the life
       of the weapon system. For items common to two or more weapons systems or end items,
       use the age of the youngest system for determining length of time in the inventory.
       A4.1.2.4. The IM must comply with the procedures in AFMCMAN 23-1, for computing
       insurance or numeric stockage objective levels.
       A4.1.2.5. The IM will use the procedures in AFMCMAN 23-1 to ensure the selected
       retention level for computing items is computed correctly.
       A4.1.2.6. The IM must transfer all assets to disposals that have no usage, no
       authorization, and no allowance for retention.
       A4.1.2.7. All serviceable and economically reparable assets will be retained for NSNs in
       the inventory seven years or less. The NSN is not mature enough for retention or disposal
       decisions.
   A4.1.3. A retention level up to, but not to exceed, five (5) each will be established for
   insurance items. Assets in excess of this quantity must be transferred to disposal.
   A4.1.4. With the approval of HQ AF/A4L, weapon systems deferred disposal codes will be
   assigned. Assets with deferred disposal codes will not appear on the RDS excess review
   listing for retention or disposal decisions, but will be reviewed for possible disposal action
   when conducting review of the requirements computation.
   A4.1.5. Assets no longer applicable to active weapons systems due to design change,
   engineering change proposals, modification, etc., will be assigned acquisition advice code
AFMCMAN23-5V3 9 JUNE 2014                                                                     37


  "Y" in the cataloging system. This allows the assets to appear on the excess review listing for
  subsequent disposal action, regardless of the presence of a deferred disposal code.
  A4.1.6. Potential reutilization (PR) applicable to weapon systems or end items phasing out
  of the inventory -- dispose of that quantity which exceeds all known requirements.
  A4.1.7. Contingency retention stock (CRS) assets that are grossly impacting warehouse
  storage space -- dispose upon validation that disposal will not adversely impact the AF
  mission. The IM documents and keeps the rationale for this decision in the NSN file.
  A4.1.8. Serviceable assets peculiar to weapons systems or end items used solely by FMS --
  dispose of if no demands in the past two years.
  A4.1.9. Wholesale IMs will offer excess assets to other using service wholesale managers
  before initiating disposal action. Do not defer or delay disposal action pending response.
