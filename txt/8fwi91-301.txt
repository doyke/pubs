1. Definitions. For the purposes of this instruction, the term ―doors refers to the large main
aircraft PAS, hangar, or Aircraft Hush House (hush house) doors that aircraft and equipment pass
through. Personnel doors and manually operated overhead doors that do not pose a substantial
pinch or crush hazard are not subject to this instruction.
2. Training. All supervisors are responsible for ensuring their personnel are trained prior to
operating manual and powered PAS, hangar, and hush house doors. Training is required for all
personnel expected to operate, or work in the immediate vicinity of these doors.
     2.1. 8th Maintenance Operations Squadron, Maintenance Training Flight (8 MOS/MXOT)
     will conduct PAS, hangar, and hush house door safety and awareness training for all
     personnel who work in or around PAS, hangars, or hush houses as a part of maintenance
     orientation training. As a minimum, door safety and awareness training will include door
     operation hazards, warnings and cautions, and emergency procedures.
     2.2. Squadron commanders will ensure units conduct in-house, hands-on operation
     qualification training for all personnel expected to operate manual and powered PAS, hangar,
     and/or hush house doors. As a minimum, training will include door hazards, operations, and
     emergency procedures.
     2.3. Maintenance Supervision with custodian authority will develop procedures for manual
     door operations in the event that powered PAS, hangar, or hush house doors fail to operate.
     See LCL-8 MXG-012 for manual PAS door operation, 8 MXG Form 15 for manual hangar
     doors and 8 MXG Form 16 for normal PAS door operation.
     2.4. Training will be documented in the Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS). For
     those personnel not loaded in the IMDS data base, training will be documented on AF Form
     797 and AF Form 55. The IMDS course codes will be as follows:
        2.4.1. 36-Month PAS, Hangar, and Hush House Door Awareness training-29110.
        2.4.2. Hands-On Manual Hangar Door Training-032373.
        2.4.3. Hands-On Powered PAS and Hangar Door Operation-29111.
        2.4.4. Hands-On Hush House Door Operation-000064.
3. Door Operational Checkout.
     3.1. Squadron commanders will ensure all building custodians perform monthly inspections
     of PAS, hangar and hush house door operations and safety features in accordance with
     (IAW) AFOSHSTD 91-100.
     3.2. All discrepancies will be noted and work orders submitted to 8th Civil Engineer
     Squadron (8 CES). Ensure that doors that are found to be unsafe or unusable to operate are
     identified and locked out IAW AFOSHSTD 91-501.
     3.3. Additionally, building custodians will schedule annual 8 CES inspection and preventive
     maintenance visits to ensure door mechanisms and safety features are properly maintained.
     3.4. Cold Weather Hangar Door Operation.
        3.4.1. Upon notification of freezing conditions these actions will be complied with for
        facilities with Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF). The list of facilities affected is as
        follows:
8FWI91-301 31 JULY 2012                                                                        3


              BUILDING S-20, POL
              BUILDING 2257, FUEL BARN
              BUILDING 2820, PAINT BARN
              BUILDING 2827, WASH RACK
       3.4.2. Temperatures between 0 to 32 degrees Fahrenheit; bay doors will remain open no
       longer than 30 minutes and remain closed for 30 minutes before re-opening.
       3.4.3. Temperatures below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, bay doors will remain open no longer
       than 15 minutes and remain closed for a minimum of 60 minutes before re-opening.
       3.4.4. Heaters may be applied to the aircraft bay to shorten the recovery time.
4. Identification of Hazards. All areas that pose a potential pinch or crush hazard must be
marked to ensure no one enters that area during door operation. This will be designated the clear
zone. It is the responsibility of the door operator(s) to ensure the area remains clear of non-
essential personnel during door operation. The clear zone will be identified as follows:
   4.1. Powered PAS, hangar, or hush house doors will always be opened to a width of at least
   ten feet. For special operations, such as during extreme weather conditions, the door may be
   opened less than ten feet only if the door control switch is locked off or out and remains
   locked out until the door can be opened to ten feet or more or be closed. (See AFOSHSTD
   91-66, General Industrial operations, for lockout requirements.)
   4.2. Manually operated doors have no minimum opening distance requirement, but a ―clear
   zone exists. A clear zone will be defined for any area that creates a pinch or crush hazard.
   4.3. For all doors, the clear zone must be established on the floor inside and on the ground
   outside with a three-inch-wide yellow and black striped line. Ensure that the clear zone
   provides the minimal safe distance required to prevent injury. Additionally, ensure that a
   clear zone is defined for each door, as in multiple door situations.
5. Manual and Powered PAS and Hangar Door Operating Procedures.
   5.1. Maintenance Supervision with custodian authority will develop operational procedures
   peculiar to each type of manual and powered PAS and hangar door and post at each of the
   door control panels.
       5.1.1. Procedures will be coordinated through 8 MXG/MXOT and 8 MXG/MXQ prior to
       8 MXG/CC approval. The procedures will be reviewed annually. See LCL-8MXG-012
       for manual PAS door operation, 8 MXG Form 15 for manual hangar doors and 8 MXG
       Form 16 for normal PAS door operation.
6. Signage Requirements. Proper signage, in both English and Hangul (Korean) languages,
will be posted as a minimum requirement for all aircraft hangar and PAS doors. The following
signs are required:
   6.1. A 7 by 10 DANGER sign will be posted at the door control and or grab area. It will
   display the word ―DANGER in a 1-7/16 white font on a red oval background, with the
   statement, ―ONLY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AUTHORIZED BY THEIR SQUADRON
   COMMANDER MAY OPERATE HANGAR/SHELTER DOORS IAW AFOSHSTD 91-
   100, Aircraft Flight Line - Ground Operations And Activities, para 7.2.3.4. printed below it.
   (See Attachment 2, Door Control Sign Example).
4                                                                  8FWI91-301 31 JULY 2012


    6.2. A 14 by 20 DANGER sign will be posted at a location clearly visible to personnel
    approaching the hazard area. It will display the word ―DANGER in a 2-7/8 white font on a
    red background, with the statement, ―HAZARDOUS AREA – STAND CLEAR DURING
    DOOR OPERATIONS printed below it. (See Attachment 3, Clear Zone Sign Example).
    6.3. Ensure directional arrows are placed next to the door controls that clearly indicate the
    direction of door travel for each corresponding switch or button. Directional arrows must be
    luminescent or reflective, IAW AFOSHSTD 91-100, para 7.2.3.2.
    6.4. Additionally, each powered PAS door will have a placard posted adjacent to the door
    controls that indicates the door’s serviceability. A green placard with the words, ―DOOR
    OPERATIVE will be used to identify serviceable, operative doors. A red placard with the
    words, ―DOOR INOPERATIVE will be used to identify unserviceable, inoperative doors,
    and will have the CE work order number annotated. For those doors that are inoperative,
    lockout or tagout requirements remain
