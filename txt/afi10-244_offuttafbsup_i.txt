                                            Chapter 1

             AIR AND SPACE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE (AEF) CONCEPTS

1.1. General. The AEF is the Air Force’s force generation construct used to manage the battle
rhythm of expeditionary forces in order to meet global CCDR requirements while maintaining
the highest possible level of overall readiness. Through the AEF, the Air Force establishes a
predictable, standardized battle rhythm ensuring rotational forces are properly organized, trained,
equipped, and ready to sustain capabilities while rapidly responding to emerging crises. Through
the AEF, the Air Force supports defense strategy requirements using a combination of both
permanently assigned and rotational (allocated) forces.
     1.1.1. How to use this AFI. This AFI governs Unit Type Code (UTC) readiness reporting.
     This instruction should be followed in the context of AFI 10-401 Air Force Operations
     Planning and Execution, which contains planning considerations for these UTCs and a full
     description of AEF concepts. In cases where this AFI and AFI 10-401 contradict, AFI 10-401
     will take precedence. Chapter 1 contains the basic description of the AEF and AEF UTC
     Reporting Tool (ART). Chapter 2 outlines roles and responsibilities in UTC reporting.
     Chapter 3 describes assessment and reporting policies.
1.2. Reporting AEF Readiness - General. To view the health of USAF forces postured in the
UTC Availability (UTA), Air Force senior leadership determined the need to collect UTC
readiness data from ART reportable units in sufficient detail to support the following goals:
     1.2.1. Provide HQ USAF, AF Component Commanders, AF components to Joint Force
     Providers (JFPs), MAJCOM's, and the Directorate of Air and Space Expeditionary Forces
     Operations (AFPC/DPW) readiness information to employ, manage, and sustain AEF
     operations.
     1.2.2. Provide units a mechanism to report a UTC’s ability or inability to fulfill its Mission
     Capability Statement (MISCAP) across the full range of military operations (ROMO), to
     include contingency and rotational operations, and highlight associated deficiencies within
     the UTC.
     1.2.3. Provide information to aid resource allocation and tasking decisions during steady
     state and crisis actions.
1.3. System Description. The AEF UTC Reporting Tool (ART) allows units the ability to
report UTC level readiness data. It provides one central location to archive reported data. It
allows immediate updates and ready access to an aggregate UTC status for all levels of
command with sufficient depth of information to make informed decisions on the employment of
forces for AEF operations. It further provides a means for identifying and analyzing actionable
indicators of change.
     1.3.1. ART is a web-based, non-intrusive, html-environment tool with associated databases
     to support collection, collation, and report generation of unit and aggregate UTC readiness
     data. It resides on the SIPRNET (https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil) for secure access.
     Units that have standard UTCs postured in UTC Availability (UTA) view and report their
     status against these UTCs directly within the ART application.
AFI10-244_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 27 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   5


  1.3.2. ART's report generating capability allows all levels of command to arrange data to
  produce tailored written reports and graphics. The reports section is read-only and can be
  accessed by anyone with SIPRNET access and an AEF Online account.
  1.3.3. A fully functional training site will be maintained by AFPC/DPW. This site allows
  personnel to review the ART tutorial and other guidance. There are no restrictions on this
  site; anyone can login and enter training data or experiment with the report section. DO NOT
  enter real world data on the training site.
  1.3.4. Operationally, ART collects and collates unit-reported data to answer, in whole or in
  part, the following questions:
     1.3.4.1. Are UTCs able to accomplish their MISCAP?
     1.3.4.2. Are UTCs able to accomplish their deployment tasking?
     1.3.4.3. Are adequate resources and training available in order to accomplish and sustain
     the AEF mission(s)?
  1.3.5. ART complements readiness data reported in the Status of Resources and Training
  System (SORTS). ART focuses reporting on the modular, scalable capability-based UTCs
  designed to meet the needs of the AEF while SORTS is unit-centric.

                                            Chapter 2

                           ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. ART Reporting. Effective management of Air Force resources requires accurate
information at all levels. Within the AEF construct, the UTC assessments are used to determine
the most effective force tasking. When unit commanders present the readiness of each postured
UTC in ART, they provide higher levels of command the necessary information to make force
and resource allocation decisions to effectively support theater commanders. For this reason,
integrity in reporting an accurate status is paramount. ART is not a report card, but identifies a
UTCs ability to perform its MISCAP and identify shortages of resources. Therefore,
commanders must "tell it like it is."
2.2. Headquarters USAF.
     2.2.1. Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF). Responsible for organizing, training, and
     equipping air, space, and cyber forces to meet CCDR requirements.
     2.2.2. Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, Plans, and Requirements (HQ USAF/A3/5).
     Oversees AEF operational planning and represents the Air Force on all AEF policy and
     doctrine to include all matters involving the scheduling, sourcing, operation planning, and
     presentation of AEF capabilities. Coordinates AF-wide efforts to develop capabilities and
     field AEF forces and the associated operational-level C2 infrastructure and units. Coordinates
     with MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs, AFPC/DPW, and USAF component commands to ensure
     unity in the AEF implementation effort. Oversees AEF operational planning and concept
     development. Conducts analysis of operational concepts supporting AEF operations through
     the Air Force Studies and Analysis Agency.
        2.2.2.1. Directorate, Operational Planning, Policy and Strategy (HQ USAF/A5X). USAF
        focal point for developing and integrating operational strategies, requirements, policies,
        guidance, and plans necessary to support AEF operations worldwide supporting the war
        fighter. AF OPR on UTC efforts, AEF libraries (UTA), Joint Strategic Capability Plan
        (JSCP) issues, AEF sourcing issues, FAM interface, and AEF relationship to OPLAN
        guidance. The War and Mobilization Planning Policy Division (A5XW) develops general
        policies regarding all facets of the AEF, of UTCs and the general guidelines for assigning
        postured UTCs to the AEF construct. They are responsible for managing the UTA in
        DCAPES, but not for the actual updating of available UTCs.
        2.2.2.2. Directorate of Operations (HQ USAF/A3O). Responsible for overall AF current
        operations, readiness and training. Administers policies governing operational training,
        force readiness, range and airspace issues, personnel recovery, and special plans and
        programs. As the OPR for AF readiness, this directorate coordinates with AFPC/DPW on
        force readiness issues for AEF operations.
     2.2.3. The Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, Installations and Mission Support (HQ
     USAF/A4/7). Develops policy and provides guidance for all logistics plans, transportation,
     supply, maintenance, civil engineer, security forces, and munitions support. Acts as HQ
     USAF lead for developing Agile Combat Support (ACS) capabilities, and appropriately
     sizing these capabilities as Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS), to support AEF operations.

   2.2.4. Air Staff Functional Area Managers (FAMs). The Air Staff FAM acts as a central
   coordinator of the actions of their MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs counterparts to ensure their
   applicable functional area UTCs are being properly assigned to the AEF construct. (See AFI
   10-401 for additional Air Staff FAM responsibilities). Monitor MAJCOM reporting to
   identify trends and elevate UTC shortfalls and deficiencies for resolution to maximize
   deployable resources.
   2.2.5. Commander, Air Force Reserve Command (HQ AFRC/CC dual-rolled as HQ
   USAF/RE). Establishes policy and provides guidance for the participation of AFRC forces in
   AEF operations.
   2.2.6. The Director, Air National Guard (NGB/CF). Establishes policy and provides
   guidance for the participation of Air National Guard (ANG) forces in AEF operations.
   2.2.7. For a more complete description of roles and responsibilities for AEF see AFI 10-401.
2.3. Air      Force      Personnel      Center     Directorate      of      AEF     Operations
(AFPC/DPW). AFPC/DPW is a cross-functional, centralized management team responsible for
planning, configuring, scheduling, and preparing AEFs. Responsibilities specifically include
AEF scheduling for steady state operational requirements. The AFPC/DPW integrates trained
aerospace forces to meet theater CCDRs' requirements. Included in this is responsibility for
working with the Air Force Operations Group during crisis action planning and with HQ
USAF/A3/5 for force reconstitution planning. Identifies escalated reconstitution requirements
when force commitment exceeds sustainment levels. Coordinates with MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs
to identify units in surge operations and those that require reconstitution. Monitors personnel,
training, equipment, and supply status throughout surge operations, advising Air Staff of critical
impacts to on-call operations, the AEF schedule, and Major War (MW) execution.
   2.3.1. Authority. AFPC/DPW is the CSAF designated coordinating authority for executing
   the Air Forces battle rhythm and delivering versatile air and space power. Accordingly,
   AFPC/DPW is direct liaison authorized (DIRLAUTH) across all MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs,
   AF Component Commands (AFCCs), and deployed units to provide readiness oversight and
   to integrate required planning and sourcing processes. Although AFPC/DPW has no chain of
   command authority with AEF units, it may use ART information for recommending courses
   of action to the AF leadership to facilitate expeditionary operations, to include
   recommending sourcing and tasking during crisis planning.
   2.3.2. ART Operation. AFPC/DPW is the system manager for ART. UTA is the data source
   for ART and is uploaded to ART weekly to incorporate changes made to AF posturing. As
   the manager for ART and coordinating authority for AEF operations, AFPC/DPW advises
   HQ USAF A1, A3/5 and CSAF on readiness issues pertaining to AEF. It advises on AF
   reporting policies and procedures for ART, and issues affecting force readiness and their
   reporting in this system. The AFPC/DPW has the following responsibilities:
       2.3.2.1. Maintain the currency of the database by loading UTA data into ART to identify
       UTC additions, changes and deletions.
       2.3.2.2. Maintain and update ART web site and training web site capability as required.
       2.3.2.3. Review, validate, prioritize and fix ART functionality problems.

     ensure that unit is postured IAW AFI 10-401 guidance. Resolve posturing disputes with
     MAJCOM FAM, OFAMO, and/or AEF Cell IAW MAJCOM policies and procedures.
     Responsible for associating, tracking, and managing personnel and equipment in UTCs and
     assigning them to the proper AEF. Commanders should consider known issues that will
     impact the UTC (i.e., pending retirements/PCS).
     2.5.3. Individual Personnel must ensure they are ready for deployment IAW AFI 10-403,
     AFI 10-401 and other official directives. Deficiencies must be brought to the attention of
     supervisors and unit commanders as soon as known.
        2.5.3.1. Report any change to their personal readiness status to their supervisor, UDM,

2.6. ART Reporting Process Responsibilities
2.6. (OFFUTTAFB)ART Reporting Process Responsibilities
     2.6.1. MAJCOM. Designate OPRs for ART and establish procedures for identifying and
     tracking wing and unit level write-access-approved ART OPRs. MAJCOMs will posture
     appropriate UTCs in UTA. ART is a command and control system designed to give readiness
     information on ART reportable forces. ART reportable forces are those Combat, Combat
     Service and Combat Service Support units that have standard UTCs postured in UTA.
     Appropriate procedures and OPRs should be designated to ensure that ART reporting is
     consistent with other readiness reporting systems and procedures. Additionally, MAJCOMs
     are responsible for the following:
        2.6.1.1. Ensuring their units are properly trained in ART data reporting procedures.
        2.6.1.2. Ensuring timeliness, accuracy and validity of subordinate unit’s data.
AFI10-244_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 27 NOVEMBER 2013                                                 9


     2.6.1.3. Sampling, reviewing, and assessing adequacy of the remarks and challenging
     inadequate remarks.
     2.6.1.4. Notifying units of added, changed or deleted UTCs.
     2.6.1.5. Ensuring MAJCOM assists units in resolving posturing concerns and respond to
     ”incorrectly postured” UTCs.
     2.6.1.6. Monitoring ART for late or unreported UTCs on a weekly basis and
     researching/rectifying incorrectly postured UTCs prior to the next month's reporting
     cycle.
  2.6.2. Numbered Air Forces (NAFs)
     2.6.2.1. NAFs are responsible for the timeliness, accuracy and validity of subordinate
     unit’s data.
     2.6.2.2. NAFs will review, assess adequacy of the remarks and will challenge inadequate
     remarks.
  2.6.3. Wing/Base Commander:
     2.6.3.1. Designate wing level ART OPR by letter or e-mail as directed by MAJCOM,
     FOA, or DRU guidance. Designation will include name(s), rank(s), organization, DSN
     telephone number, classified e-mail and unclassified e-mail addresses.
        2.6.3.1.1. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) The 55 WG/CC will designate one member, as
        well as at least one alternate, from 55 LRS/LGRDX to serve as the 55 WG ART
        Monitor.
        2.6.3.1.2. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) Each unit commander owning standard UTCs
        must appoint at least one primary and one alternate unit ART monitor. See
        Attachment 2 for the Sample Appointment Letter.
     2.6.3.2. Ensure UTC assessments and information provided by subordinate unit
     commanders are accurate, timely, valid, and complete.
     2.6.3.3. Ensure ART OPRs conduct and document initial and annual ART training. ART
     OPRs will conduct ART training within 30 days of appointment and document IAW
     MAJCOM/local directives. Ensure all personnel involved in ART reporting are trained in
     classified and unclassified data handling procedures.
        2.6.3.3.1. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) Upon appointment as a unit ART monitor, the
        appointed member must make contact with the 55 WG ART Monitor or alternate for
        training. The 55 Wing ART Monitor can be reached via DSN: 271-7733 or 271-
        7732. This training must be accomplished within 30 days of appointment.
        2.6.3.3.2. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) Upon request for training from the 55 WG ART
        Monitor, one-on-one, hands-on training will be scheduled at a mutually agreeable
        time between the two parties. Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) will be
        provided with 55 WG-specific training slides and advised to review AFI 10-244
        (Along with the ACC Sup and this document), the training aids found under the help
        dropdown menu on the ART website, and Chapters 1-8 of the ART 3.0 User’s
10                                  AFI10-244_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 27 NOVEMBER 2013


         Manual (which can also be found under the help menu). The 55 WG ART Monitor
         will provide GSU monitors with any assistance that can be provided via telephone.
         2.6.3.3.3. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) Refresher training will be required of all unit
         ART monitors annually and will be tracked by the 55 WG ART Monitor.
     2.6.3.4. Ensure unit commanders are aware of all tasked and postured UTCs, through
     official deployment information systems.
     2.6.3.5. Review wing ART reporting at least monthly with respective unit commanders.
         2.6.3.5.1. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) The Wing ART monitor (or alternate) will brief
         55 WG/CC monthly during the second Wing Staff Meeting of each month (typically,
         the second Monday). The Installation Deployment Officer (IDO); Superintendent,
         Plans and Integration; or NCOIC, Plans and Integration may also deliver the briefing
         in the case of ART monitor absence.
         2.6.3.5.2. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) The briefing classification will be SECRET and
         the briefing format will be as follows:
             2.6.3.5.2.1. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) On-Time reporting statistics (broken out
             weekly and monthly).
             2.6.3.5.2.2. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) 55 WG monthly on-time averages.
             2.6.3.5.2.3. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) Aggregate report data broken out by each
             group. The briefer will summarize changes, and the respective group commander
             will address causes, justifications, and alibis for these changes, e.g. briefer may
             state that the 55 MSG has increased X number of green UTCs, Decreased X
             number of red UTCs, and remained constant in number of not reported UTCs. At
             this time the 55 MSG/CC would provide any additional information regarding
             these changes, and answer any questions raised by the 55 WG/CC.
  2.6.4. Units.
     2.6.4.1. Appoint and train ART personnel IAW wing/group or equivalent direction.
     2.6.4.2. Designate ART OPR in writing as directed by the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU.
     Include name(s), rank(s), unit and DSN telephone number. Continuity and consistency in
     this position is critical and therefore should be for a minimum of 18 months.
     2.6.4.3. Report on all standard postured UTCs as reflected in ART.
     2.6.4.4. Ensure data and remarks adequately and accurately reflect the UTC's capability
     to perform its MISCAP.
     2.6.4.5. Ensures report submissions meet established time lines.
         2.6.4.5.1. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) In order to ensure maximum compliance, the 55
         WG ART Monitor will publish quarterly schedules designating at least one day per
         month as a “55th Wing ART Day.” On these days, each unit must log into ART and
         update all UTCs. This will ensure no UTC’s exceed 30 days without being reviewed.
         ART Monitors must still review the UTA and ART regularly to check for new UTCs
         that must be assessed within 24 hours.
AFI10-244_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 27 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     11


          2.6.4.5.2. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) On the last duty day of each week, the 55 WG
          ART Monitor will send out an email notifying which units have either an overdue
          assessment or an assessment, which will go overdue during a non-duty day. Units
          will be required to make this update NLT 1500hrs CST on the day of notification.
      2.6.4.6. Review discrepancies noted in previous reports and actions being taken to
      correct them.
      2.6.4.7. If discrepancies are noted between other deployment tasking databases and the
      UTA information loaded in ART, it is incumbent on the unit to research the disconnect
      and work to resolve the issue with MAJCOM FAMs.
   2.6.5. Units Required to Report. All Air Force units including Air National Guard and
   Reserve components owning standard UTCs postured in UTA report the readiness of their
   UTCs IAW this instruction.
2.7. Total Force Integration (TFI) Readiness Reporting Guidance
   2.7.1. TFI units are critical to Air Force operations. They are organizational constructs that
   functionally integrate units from the regular Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force
   Reserve. Each unit in the association (host and associate) will independently report their
   UTCs' readiness in ART.

                                           Chapter 3

                                  REPORTING GUIDANCE

3.1. Classification. ART contains real world deployment and personnel data. It is incumbent on
all personnel to be aware of the classification of data entered in ART. All ART assessment data
and aggregate unit UTC reports are classified secret IAW Executive Order (EO) 12958. Do not
enter data that is classified under other guidance such as "Special Access Required" information
or Privacy Act of 1972. ART is not Privacy Act compliant.
3.2. ART Data Classification. Executive Order (EO) 12958, Classified National Security
Information, requires us to protect classified information while striking a balance between
protection and the need to inform the American public of their governmental activities.
Additionally, this EO increases and emphasizes personal responsibility for classification and
declassification decisions.
   3.2.1. Derivative Classification. Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing,
   restating, or generating in a new form, information that is already classified, and marking the
   newly developed material consistent with the classification markings that apply on the source
   information.
       3.2.1.1. Derivative Classifier. Persons applying derivative classification markings must
       carry forward to any newly created document the classification markings from the
       original source or document.
       3.2.1.2. ART assessment data (i.e., color codes, missing resources detailed in remarks,
       and limiting factors) for a single UTC, is classified SECRET.
       3.2.1.3. Aggregate ART assessments (two or more UTC assessments) are classified
       SECRET. ART data converted to a new type information must be evaluated for its
       impact on national security if released. This covers any use of ART data in other forms
       (briefings, presentations, e-mails, etc) with the desire to circumvent classification
       guidance.
       3.2.1.4. Data classification. Raw resource data used to derive UTC assessments is
       classified IAW its original source. When data is directly associated with an ART rating or
       used in an ART worksheet, the data becomes classified IAW this guidance. Preformatted
       worksheets should be clearly marked with instructions on classification.
       3.2.1.5. Classification Authority. ART combines elements of the JOPES database with
       unit readiness assessment information. Information extracted from this database is
       classified IAW CJCSI 3401.02 and CJCSM 3150.02 and must contain derivative
       classification markings consistent with EO 12958, except where authorized otherwise.
       Derivative classification rules apply when extracts contain exempted data.
       3.2.1.6. Classification Marking. ART data or extracts are classified by this AFI. Mark
       documents or data “DERIVED FROM: AFI 10-244, Declassify on: (date).” The date of
       declassification is 10 years from the date of the document for each level of classification.
       3.2.1.7. Downgrading Authority. Initial downgrading of force readiness data and
       aggregate information will be determined by CJCS. HQ USAF/A3/5 is the authority to
AFI10-244_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 27 NOVEMBER 2013                                                      13


       extend or accelerate downgrading classification of ART and SORTS data following an
       initial determination by CJCS.
3.3. Global Force Management. The AF currently uses a Tempo Banding construct to present,
schedule and deploy its forces. ART reports readiness of AF resources to support both
Contingency and Crisis Action planning processes. To meet both rotational scheduling
(traditional AEF type) and crisis response scheduling, it is vital to determine which band/block
for which FY is visible at what time. That visibility process is managed by AFPC/DPWPA in
conjunction with AF/A5XW and is based on business rules to ensure the best data is visible at
the right time to provide the best sourcing solution. AF/A5XW publishes the execution
vulnerability windows for all the upcoming band/blocks along with guidance under which FY
each of those band/blocks will execute.
3.3.1. Business rules for determining if a Band/Block is visible in ART:
       3.3.1.1. Blocks are made visible in ART NLT 8 months prior to execution of that block.
       The purpose of the '8-Month Rule' is to give all units 2 months to review and assess the
       new cycle data before standard sourcing begins. It is understood that in some rare
       occasions that units postured in the current FY but not in the next FY, may lose visibility
       of that resource in ART when the 8-Month Rule brings the next cycle into ART. Units
       undergoing BRAC/Service-directed resource action are one example where this may
       come into play.
       3.3.1.2. Blocks are removed from ART after the availability date has expired.
       3.3.1.3. When an expired block is removed, the next occurrence for that block will be
       added.
       3.3.1.4. Bands or blocks not expected to execute during the FY will have the current FY
       cycle made visible until the 8-month rule comes into effect. This ensures visibility of
       current FY authorizations during that FY even though that resource is not planned to be
       available. The goal is to support crisis sourcing if needed.
       3.3.1.5. Enablers are rolled over from the current FY to the next FY in October of each
       year.
3.3.2. What to Report. Commanders will report the unit’s current cycle and the next cycle; if
applicable to support each postured UTC. NOTE: ART uses an extract of the approved
UTC/UIC AEF posturing from UTA application in DCAPES. Associate-UTCs (A-UTCs) -
UTCs designated with a posturing code of "A" are not currently reported in ART. ART is not a
posturing tool, it is an assessment tool. For a commander to obtain a complete sight picture as to
what their prospective expeditionary commitments are, they should obtain a database extract for
their respective UICs from UTA and any OPLAN / CONPLAN / FUNCPLAN TPFDD UIC
specific entries.
   3.3.2.1. Units reporting SORTS with UTCs postured in UTA shall continue to report
   SORTS IAW their Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statement and AFI 10-201, in
   addition to reporting in ART.
3.4. UTC Readiness Assessments. Assessments are based on all aspects of the UTC to include:
(1) the ability to accomplish the Mission Capability (MISCAP) Statement, (2) the ability to
fulfill the standard manpower requirements, and (3) the ability to fulfill the complete equipment
 14                                  AFI10-244_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 27 NOVEMBER 2013


requirements. The Logistic Force Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR) Logistics Detail (LOGDET)
and Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) of the Manpower and Equipment Force
Packaging System (MEFPAK) will be used to maintain the manpower and equipment
requirements.
3.4. (OFFUTTAFB)UTC Readiness Assessments
   3.4.1. Response Time. If a UTC is on a DOC statement, then the UTC readiness assessment
   is based on resources that are expected to be mission ready and available within their DOC
   response time. Unless otherwise directed the UTC must be mission ready and available
   within 72 hours of tasking depending on the UTC requirements.
   3.4.2. MISCAP provides a brief description of the capability for which the UTC is designed
   and may provide authorized substitutions to AFSCs, skill levels, grades, and SEIs. If no
   restrictions or substitutions are listed refer to Attachment 4 for AFSC consideration.
   3.4.3. LOGFOR provides a list of equipment the UTC requires to perform the mission.
   3.4.4. MANFOR contains the manpower detail required to provide the capability for a
   standard UTC.
   3.4.5. Commanders provide an assessment of UTC readiness based on the unit's ability to
   provide the UTC for mission execution at any time.
   3.4.6. Commanders are not constrained by the unit SORTS "C" rating when assessing the
   health of the UTC. For example, a unit may have an overall rating of C-3 in GSORTS
   (Global Status of Resources and Training System) but a particular UTC from the unit will be
   assessed Green; conversely a unit may have a C-1 rating but one of its UTCs could be
   assessed Red.
   3.4.7. Commanders rate each UTC against the unit's current ability to deploy and employ the
   UTC. Areas to be considered are personnel, training, equipment or supply, and equipment
   condition. Personnel must be fully qualified without deployment limitations and have all
   required mission and skill level training complete IAW applicable directives and instructions.
   Equipment must be serviceable and available for deployment.
      3.4.7.1. Equipment and supplies on hand reporting includes the status of LOGFOR
      equipment and supplies required to support the UTC. It may indicate budget and supply
      problems when details are known. Commanders determine the readiness status based on
      the availability of mission required equipment and supplies. Items are considered
      available if they are assigned to the unit, physically present at the unit or have been
      deployed by the unit with an expectation of return.
      3.4.7.2. The equipment condition area is used to determine the combat essential and
      support equipment that can be made ready within the UTC's response time to undertake
      the mission. Units assess the condition of equipment based on whether the available UTC
      required equipment (as determined in paragraph 3.4.7.1.) is in working order and
      mission ready.
      3.4.7.3. The training assessment area indicates the status of training needed to support
      the mission for which a UTC is designed as described in the UTC Mission Capability
      (MISCAP). All personnel assigned to a UTC must have all required UTC and skill level
      training completed IAW applicable directives and instructions at the time of assessment.
AFI10-244_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 27 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     15


     Individual training not required by the UTC (MISCAP or manpower detail) will not
     affect the UTC readiness assessment but will be captured for deployment readiness
     tracking.
     3.4.7.4. Units should report the status of UTCs as stand-alone requirements. For
     “rainbow” UTCs where a UTC has both personnel and equipment requirements, but
     shares the equipment with a sister organization already deployed, the UTC should be
     assessed as Red, since it does not currently have the required equipment prior to
     deployment. For a “rainbow” UTC, a comment should be entered to indicate the status of
     the shared equipment.
  3.4.8. Commanders are expected to use their judgment during assessments of missing or
  deficient capabilities, e.g. a shortage of one computer may not make a UTC red, but a
  shortage of one generator may. Remarks should reflect training requirements and/or resource
  actions necessary to improve the readiness status.
  3.4.9. In addition and independent of the readiness stoplight (Green, Yellow, Red)
  assessment, each unit will indicate if a UTC is tasked to deploy and, if tasked, whether it can
  meet theater specific requirements including line remarks within deployment timeline.
  3.4.10. When skill level and/or grade substitutions, not explicitly allowed in the MISCAP
  but authorized IAW AFI 10-403 guidance, are used in ART reporting, they will be noted
  using the Standard Assessment Remark of Skill Level or Grade, and drive an assessment
  equivalent to the assessment found in guidance within Attachment 4 of this AFI.
  3.4.11. Commanders will continue to accomplish Readiness assessments even if the
  capability is deployed. When conducting such assessments units will presume that the health
  of the ALN has not changed unless circumstances/information warrants otherwise. Whether
  or not an ALN is deployed, has no impact on the readiness assessment. If a UTC is deployed
  and was being assessed as Green, commanders will continue to assess the UTC as Green
  unless circumstances/information warrants otherwise. For UTCs that were deployed while
  being assessed Yellow or Red, commanders will continue with that assessment until
  circumstances/information warrants upgrading the assessment.
  3.4.12. Comments regarding ULN and RDD-type information must be applied to the
  “TASKING ASSESSMENT REMARK” not “CC Comments”.
  3.4.13. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) Upon the need for an updated or new UTC assessment, the
  unit ART monitor will log into ART and review current UTC assessment data. Units will
  update UTCs accordingly to meet either the minimum 31 day reporting requirement, report
  on a new UTC, or report a change to status.
     3.4.13.1. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) When updating applicable data, unit ART monitors
     will save the assessment under the “CC Review Status” and hold reports in that the
     respective commander gives status until final approval.
     3.4.13.2. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) Unit ART monitors are to utilize the commander’s
     approval report provided by the ART database, but may use supplementary briefing
     materials as the respective commander sees fit.
     3.4.13.3. (Added-OFFUTTAFB) Upon commander’s signature on the commander’s
     approval report, unit ART monitors will store this signed report in their local continuity
 16                                   AFI10-244_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 27 NOVEMBER 2013


       binder. At this time, unit ART monitors must log back into ART and update the UTC
       status “CC Approved.”
3.5. Assess the overall health of a UTC. The UTC represents a capability that is assessed
using the category areas described in paragraph 3.4.7. The overall assessment will be rated using
the following guidelines and the ART Monitor Assessment checklist (Attachment 2). Think of
the monthly assessment as a Yes/No process (Figure 3.1). Additionally, a Yes/No process can be
used when assessing if a UTC is tasked to deploy and if it can meet theater specific requirements
(Figure 3.2).
   3.5.1. Green. The complete UTC to include the exact MANFOR and LOGFOR equipment
   with only MISCAP explicit substitutions, or green skill level, or grade substitutions (see
   Attachment 4). All required deployment training for the UTC can be accomplished within 72
   hours of notification or sooner if subject to more stringent criteria.
   3.5.2. Yellow. The UTC has a missing or deficient MANFOR or LOGFOR requirement, but
   that missing or deficient capability does not prevent the UTC from being tasked and
   accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation. This includes AFI 10-403
   approved standard substitutions. Provide a detailed explanation in remarks. Describe the
   condition, the corrective action and provide a projected get-well date. In the event that a skill
   level or grade is dependent only on a members’ promotion it still needs to be noted and, if
   not listed in Attachment 4, still drives a “Yellow” Readiness Assessment at a minimum.
   3.5.3. Red. The UTC has a missing or deficient capability that prevents the entire UTC from
   being tasked and accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation. Provide
   detailed explanation of the shortfall in remarks. Describe the shortfall, the corrective action
   and provide a get-well date.
   3.5.4. Black (Incorrectly postured). UTCs are assessed “incorrectly postured” when the UTC
   is postured against the unit in UTA and the unit commander believes this to be in error based
   on a comparison of authorizations to postured positions. An explanation must be provided in
   the commander’s remarks section to explain why the unit commander believes the UTC was
   postured in error. Assigning this rating in ART will automatically generate an email to the
   MAJCOM ART POC, raising the issue with the MAJCOM FAM to help determine whether
   or not the UTC is correctly postured. A detailed explanation is to be provided in the email of
   why the UTC should not be postured in UTA. For coordination and resolution, this
   information will be forwarded to the MAJCOM FAM responsible for posturing the UTC in
   UTA.
   3.5.5. After each refresh, a change report is produced and available through the ‘reports’ tab.
   Change reports are kept within the application for three months. The owning organization is
   responsible for follow-up and review of their unit changes.

3.6. Tasked to Deploy Assessment. Upon deployment notification, commanders owning UTCs
tasked to deploy, in whole or in part, are required to assess the UTCs ability to meet theater-
specific requirements to include line remarks. This assessment is independent of the overall UTC
readiness stoplight assessment. As an example, a UTC may not have a person with specific skill
level and experience required by line remarks, however the UTC status (Green, Yellow, Red)
does not change since the readiness stoplight assessment is based on the UTCs ability to deploy
anywhere in the world at the time of the assessment. Another example is a Red UTC readiness
stoplight assessment due to equipment which could be tasked to support a personnel only theater
requirement. Even though it can meet that specific deployment tasking, the overall status is still
Red.
   3.6.1. A Yes/No process can be used when assessing if a UTC is tasked to deploy and if it
   can meet theater specific requirements (Figure 3.2).

3.7. Remarks. Plain language supplemental remarks are a critical component of the ART report
and are used as a management tool. Remarks are required if a unit is less than fully capable in
any reportable area. Remarks are used to identify trends and to redirect resources if necessary.
Remarks are mandatory for UTCs assessed Yellow and Red. All status remarks will be
standardized remarks from Standard Assessment Remarks listing maintained within ART (ART
Guidance under Information Tab) only. The Commander's Remarks section is an additional
avenue that should be utilized to provide vital information that affects the readiness or
availability of the UTC. This area of ART can be utilized regardless of the readiness status of
the UTC (i.e. Green, Yellow, or Red). For UTCs assessed as Black (Incorrectly Postured), an
explanation must be entered in the CC Remarks Section.
   3.7.1. Commanders use the remarks and associated get-well-dates (GWD) to explain and
   amplify data contained in ART reports. Write remarks in plain text English and ensure they
   contain all appropriate details such as AFSCs, projected improvements, workarounds, etc.
   Remarks should be sufficient to allow responsible managers to take specific corrective
   action. The remarks sections are not size limited.
   3.7.2. As applicable, list resource types with associated deficiencies; state numbers required,
   assigned, and available; explain the cause of the problem, if known; identify previously
AFI10-244_OFFUTTAFBSUP_I 27 NOVEMBER 2013                                                       19


   requested assistance; identify remedial actions in progress, highlight further actions required,
   and provide a projection of when the readiness status will change.
   3.7.3. Air Force standard abbreviations as reflected in AFDD 1-2 and/or AFI 10-401 are
   acceptable. However, non-common, unique, or unit/system/functional specific acronyms will
   be defined when first used in a report. Do not refer to previous reports (ART is dynamic and
   will not retain previous remarks).
   3.7.4. Wing Commanders should challenge inadequate remarks. MAJCOMs will sample,
   review, and assess adequacy of unit remarks.
3.8. When to Report. All Air Force and Air Force gained units will submit and update UTC
assessments at least every 31 calendar days. The Air Force goal for on-time reporting is 97%.
   3.8.1. Upon notification of a significant event that changes the assessment of a UTC, the unit
   commander will submit an out-of-cycle report within 24 hours of the change. This includes
   notification of a UTC change or addition.
   3.8.2. Additionally, commanders owning UTCs tasked to deploy will submit via ART an
   assessment of their ability to support the tasking, including theater-specific requirements,
   within five (5) days of receipt of a deployment notification.
   3.8.3. Units owning a UTC tasked to deploy will reset the deployment status from "Yes" to
   "No" not later than five (5) calendar days after the tasked resources in process at their home
   station.
3.9. Where to Report. ART is accessed from the AFPC/DPW homepage located at the
following URL: https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil. Click on the “AEF UTC Reporting
Tool” link. Users are required to have SIPRNET access in order to submit ART updates.

                               ART MONITOR ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST

         Table A2.1. ART Monitor Assessment Checklist
Units may use this checklist as a tool to assess UTC Personnel, Training, Equipment/       Current AEF
Supplies and Equipment Condition (PTEC) monthly in ART. ALWAYS consider what the
UTC's MISCAP states when assessing.
GREEN = There are absolutely NO UTC deficiencies in any of the four assessed areas         G
YELLOW = UTC can meet MISCAP but there are deficiencies to be noted                             Y
RED = UTC cannot meet MISCAP due to too many deficiencies                                         R
INCORRECTLY POSTURED = UTC is incorrectly postured and requires MAJCOM
FAM attention.
Check the appropriate shaded block (G, Y, R) below, depending on how you answer the question. The
lowest rating in any area will drive the overall rating of the UTC. Any deficiencies must have remarks
and Get Well Dates (GWD); check each month for expiration. Only the FINAL rating is used in ART.
Refer to the MISCAP, MANFOR, LOGFOR, MILPDS, AFI 10-244 (Ch 3), AFI 10-401 and AFI 10-403.

Once an individual is associated to an AEF, their AEFI will only be changed under extenuating
circumstances. See AFI 10-401, para 14.4.1.
