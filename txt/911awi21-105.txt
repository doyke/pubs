    2.5. Although the CDDAR Team may be called upon to assist with a military incident at a
    local airport not equipped to deal with the event, there are no current geographically
    separated units assigned to the Pittsburgh ARS.
    2.6. During normal duty hours, if an aircraft is unable to be moved on its own accord and has
    been involved in a mishap, the CDDAR Team Chief will be notified by the Maintenance
