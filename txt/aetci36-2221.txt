     and UFT-associated graduate flying training courseware and maintains the UFT Briefing
     Room Interactive (BRI) program.
     1.2.2.4. In coordination with AETC/A3R, Requirements and Resources Division,
     reviews proposed acquisition or modification programs to ensure personnel use ISD (to
     include media and cost benefit analysis) to decide the mix, quantity, and sophistication of
     training equipment and use of technology to deliver productive and cost effective
     training. Along with AETC/A3R, ensures the use of the PPBE system to identify
     resources (instructors, aircraft, simulators, etc.) and required funding support.
     1.2.2.5. For new mission aircraft, in coordination with AETC/A5R, Capability
     Requirements Division, reviews proposed acquisition or modification programs to ensure
     personnel use ISD (to include media and cost benefit analysis) to decide the mix,
     quantity, and sophistication of training equipment and use of technology to deliver
     productive and cost effective training.
     1.2.2.6. AETC is Lead Command for the Air Force-wide Aerospace Physiology (AP)
     Training program. A3F serves as POC and certifying authority for AP policy, guidance,
     and courseware; serves as manager for AP training devices. Note: Guidance contained in
     this AETCI addressing “flying training” is applicable to, and includes AP training within
     AETC.
  1.2.3. AETC/A5T, Technology Integration Division, provides oversight and program
  management of the Training Integration Management System (TIMS) and Graduate Training
  Integration Management System (GTIMS) or a follow-on enterprise TMS in response to user
  requirements defined by A3F/A3R/A3V functional managers. For detailed information
  regarding these and other A5T responsibilities, see AFI 36-2201, and AETCI 36-2223,
  Flying Training Student Information Management.”
  1.2.4. A3Q develops flying training programs and associated syllabuses for non-USAF
  aircraft in coordination with training providers (i.e. contractors, sister services and other
  government agencies), then validates, and certifies the syllabus. A3Q will coordinate new or
  substantively changed flying training syllabuses with A3F. A3Q serves as functional OPR
  for certain syllabuses including providing the POC for each applicable syllabus. The POC is
  the focal point for syllabus feedback, suggestions, and coordinates all syllabus revisions and
  changes as necessary and submits for approval.

     1.2.5. Wings, groups, squadrons and units using AETC flying training syllabuses are the
     active, hands-on providers of AETC flying training directly to students. Commanders,
     instructors, staff, and students all have a responsibility for effective Air Force flying training
     and must be active in the feedback of information regarding the effectiveness of each
     syllabus and associated training. Contact the POC through formalized feedback/evaluation
     systems or review meetings.
     1.2.6. Contractors are obligated by covenants of the particular contract which take
     precedence over this instruction. However, since the acquisition process may result in
     contractors providing any level of products or services from mission design series (MDS)
     hardware with a total training system, to instructor, administrative, or courseware services,
     contractors involved with AETC flying training have responsibilities regarding the
     development of AETC flying training programs and the resulting syllabuses and associated
     courseware production. As such, the ISD mandate of AFPD 36-26 applies.
     1.2.7. AETC/IA and Air Force Security Assistance Training Squadron (AFSAT) coordinate
     international flying training with applicable AETC/A2/3/10 divisions and Foreign Disclosure
     Offices, as necessary.
1.3. Waivers. Policy and procedures are enacted to provide quality and consistent training and
evaluation whether at an undergraduate or graduate level. Occasionally, unique circumstances
may warrant special consideration and possible waiver of policy provisions. At the same time,
because it is important to preserve fidelity of training, evaluation, and policy implementation
throughout the command, a process must be established for review of proposed waivers.
     1.3.1. Waivers that change the intent of the policy outlined in this instruction are not
     authorized without A2/3/10 (T-2) approval. Unless otherwise stated in this document,
     Wing/CCs (T-3) are the approval authority for individual personnel exceptions to the policy
     outlined in this instruction caused by special or unusual circumstances.
     1.3.2. AETC Units. Coordinate T-2 waivers through A3F. Squadron commanders will
     submit all T-2 waiver requests through command channels in electronic format. Waiver
     requests must provide justification why the individual or unit cannot comply with
     requirements. Upon completion, route approved waivers to A3F and units for filing in this
     volume according to AFI 33-360.
     1.3.3. Operations Group (OG) Commander. The OG/CC responsible for local supplements
     will handle waivers to respective unit supplemental guidance. (T-3)
1.4. Flying training publications.
     1.4.1. Information contained in flying training publications is identified as “controlled
     unclassified information" (CUI) due to MDS technical and operational content. This creates
     the requirement for the distribution and releasability statements found in front of the
     publications. Caution must be used regarding the release of data.
     1.4.2. Organizations may receive unsolicited requests for syllabuses, lesson plans, or other
     courseware documents. Requests from a contractor, who is not on contract with AETC or
     the Air Force to support the training program in question, will require a JA staff legal review
     before a response can be generated.
AETCI36-2221 3 DECEMBER 2014                                                               7


  1.4.3. In making a releasability determination, it is AETC policy that requestors provide
  information necessary to make an appropriate decision. This should include, as appropriate,
  an approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, contract
  number(s), request for proposal or request for information data, desired information, or
  sponsoring Department of Defense (DoD) activity information. In some cases, approved
  non-disclosure agreements may be required.

                                              Chapter 2

                                  SYLLABUS DEVELOPMENT

2.1. Flying Training Syllabus Development. The AETC syllabus is the primary flying training
course control document. It is a tool for the “Management” system function of the ISD model,
and is a resultant product of the analysis and design phases of ISD. Syllabus structure and flow
must contain the basic elements outlined in this instruction. Do not use copyrighted material
unless a release is obtained from the copyright owner.
     2.1.1. Syllabus Organization. Develop flying training courses as required by each MDS. A
     syllabus identifies flying training courses that are divided into phases, categories, modules or
     units of instruction. Training courses may be tracked/divided or further specialized within a
     position or crew specialty, and consequently within a syllabus. When programs or courses
     are divided as such, the syllabus must explain and identify them. Furthermore, one flying
     training program or course may consist of more than one syllabus per specialty, MDS, or
     crew position.
        2.1.1.1. Syllabus Format. Preparing flying training syllabuses, or flying training related
        courses such as SERE, is a coordinated effort between program managers and supervisors
        to ensure technical accuracy and sound instructional procedures. When not addressed
        elsewhere (i.e., an AETCI 36-2205 Volume), define syllabus controls, waivers, and
        deviations. Include procedures, necessary actions and the approval chain for waivers and
        deviations.
            2.1.1.1.1. Designate syllabuses with an alpha-numeric identifier. A3R determines the
            course identifier for undergraduate training and some graduate as applicable.
            2.1.1.1.2. Syllabus page numbering format: The cover and purpose page have no
            page numbers. Reference Attachment 3, Table 3.1, Items 3 and 4 for subsequent
            numbering. Each chapter begins at the top of a new page, regardless of whether it is
            odd or even. Page number font will be Times New Roman, 10-point, bold. Page
            headers are optional.
            2.1.1.1.3. See Attachment 3, Table 3.1 for a listing of required syllabus items.
     2.1.2. Order of Precedence. A syllabus is directive in terms of the administration, delivery,
     and evaluation system functions (see the appropriate volume of AFH 36-2235 for definitions
     of these terms). Formal flying training course syllabuses must be followed unless a waiver
     request is approved per the process stated in the syllabus. If a conflict is discovered between
     a syllabus and a directive publication (for example an AFI or AETCI), the directive
     publication takes precedence; notify the syllabus OPR of any conflict. An AETC flying
     training syllabus may be more restrictive than a directive publication, but it cannot be less
     restrictive.
     2.1.3. Syllabus Prerequisites. A syllabus is the source document for course prerequisites
     and prescribes the overall course instruction, gives special instructions, and lists each training
     event in the curriculum. In cases where other directives provide prerequisites, all
     prerequisites apply. Syllabus OPRs clarify prerequisite requirements.
AETCI36-2221 3 DECEMBER 2014                                                                  9


  2.1.4. Additional Syllabus Content. As a management tool, flying training syllabuses may
  include training events addressing other issues such as leadership training (when directed),
  physical fitness requirements (compliance with USAF or appropriate standards), ancillary
  training (when necessary), medical and physiological requirements (as appropriate for the
  flying training), record keeping requirements (AETC standards), student evaluation
  (grading), and administration and orientation (training support), or security clearances.
  Furthermore, a syllabus (when required) addresses student status such as regular Air Force,
  ANG, Air Force Reserve, cadet or international students. Depending upon the particular
  course and how training is to be conducted, the syllabus shall address each of these issues.
  Either alternate tracks within one syllabus or multiple syllabuses for a program may be used
  to accommodate these differences.
  2.1.5. Course Training Standards (CTS). Flying training courses are based upon CTS.
  Each AETC flying training syllabus outlines the training required to achieve the proficiency
  specified in the CTS. AETC flying training CTS items follow a Criterion Referenced
  Objective format and should be developed following AFMAN 36-2236, Handbook for Air
  Force Instructors.
     2.1.5.1. CTS describe the standards each student must achieve prior to completing the
     formal course. These standards must be clearly understood by training faculty and staff,
     students, and by other MAJCOM personnel.
     2.1.5.2. CTS provide the basis for syllabus development, courseware production, training
     objectives, training evaluation, and student grading. CTS are not required for courses that
     are “experiential” in nature (observable and measureable performances not appropriate),
     such as Aircrew Survival training programs and others that consist of “be familiar with”
     experiences.
     2.1.5.3. CTS must clearly state what the graduate must be able to do, under what
     conditions, and to what level of performance. The CTS format will consist of a stated
     performance, condition, and a measurable (to the extent that is possible) clearly and
     concisely worded standard. Numerical required proficiency levels (RPL) are not
     sufficient substitutes for clearly stated AETC syllabus CTS.
     2.1.5.4. In cases where the condition or standard remains the same for several CTS items
     or where it is clearly understood, it need not be listed for each performance. Stating or
     describing a condition or standard in the preceding paragraph is sufficient. For example,
     “as a crew member” or “in the aircraft or simulator” would be conditions for a number of
     performances. However, unique or special conditions, or conditions requiring certain
     equipment or using specific information must be listed.
     2.1.5.5. Standards referenced to other documents or publications, written as “in
     accordance with” other guidance or directives, is acceptable when necessary. While
     specific citations are preferred, “applicable directives” is acceptable when multiple
     directives are being referenced. It is not acceptable when there is a clear document to
     reference. AFI 11-2MDS-Specific standards are acceptable and may be directly
     referenced as CTS in a syllabus, however, syllabus OPRs are responsible for ensuring
     that such standards can be correctly gleaned from referenced documents. Deferring
     standards to sources outside OPR control might result in a standard being changed and
10                                                   AETCI36-2221 3 DECEMBER 2014


     implemented before the syllabus, courseware, resources, or training can be adjusted or
     changed to train the new standard.
     2.1.5.6. Each flying training course (and syllabus) normally has its own CTS. However,
     with adequate justification, syllabus OPR agreement, and Lead Command coordination,
     CTS may exist as a separate course document (not included within a syllabus). This
     might be done, for example, when several syllabuses use the same CTS.
     2.1.5.7. CTSs for CEA, BSOC, and SERE Specialist syllabuses may be drawn from the
     Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) Specialty Training Standards (STS)
     for the particular career field. However, the instructions in the preceding paragraphs
     apply.
     2.1.5.8. In case of a CTS conflict between an AETC syllabus and an MDS-specific
     publication, the MDS publication takes precedence over an AETC syllabus. However,
     when a syllabus CTS is more restrictive, the syllabus CTS will stand.
  2.1.6. Student Evaluation. Student evaluation must be addressed in AETC flying training
  syllabuses.
     2.1.6.1. Syllabus developers and POCs must be knowledgeable of AFI 11-202, Volume
     2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific,
     Volumes—Aircrew Evaluation Criteria. Instructors, evaluators, and students must clearly
     understand student grading policy and procedures.
     2.1.6.2. The syllabus, or AETCI 36-2205 Volume, must clearly explain how student
     performance is evaluated throughout the course of training. Evaluation subjects must be
     clearly explained in each syllabus, reference AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2 (or
     similar authoritative MAJCOM or AF-level document), or AETCI 36-2205 Volume, as
     necessary.
  2.1.7. Syllabus coordination and approval.
     2.1.7.1. Syllabus OPRs determine the required coordination agencies. Coordination may
     be necessary with NGB, AFRC, AFSAT another MAJCOM or direct reporting unit
     (DRU). Coordinate each syllabus within HQ AETC (and other MAJCOM/DRUs, as
     necessary) staff agencies for planning and resourcing, with courseware development
     staff, and with organizations responsible for the implementation (Wing, Group, TRS,
     etc.) of the flying training system or program.
     2.1.7.2. Regardless of the source, AETC units must coordinate all proposed changes to
     training and syllabuses with the HQ AETC OPR before incorporating them into the
     training program or syllabus. Units will advise HQ AETC syllabus OPRs of pertinent
     discussions with other MAJCOMs regarding proposed changes to training and syllabuses.
     OPRs will ensure resource and policy implications are addressed. Syllabuses developed
     by local units and subsequently forwarded to the OPR should undergo local coordination.
     The final product is prepared by the OPR for HQ-level coordination.
     2.1.7.3. Since the syllabus is a source document for TMS, new and changed syllabuses
     should be coordinated with TMS (TIMS, GTIMS, etc.) personnel so that TMS changes
     are planned and system alterations anticipated.
AETCI36-2221 3 DECEMBER 2014                                                                11


  2.1.8. Contractor-Developed Syllabuses.
     2.1.8.1. Unless otherwise required by contract, contractors for AETC flying training
     syllabus development will follow this instruction.
     2.1.8.2. For contracted ATS flying training, the contractor develops, updates, and
     maintains courseware and training syllabuses and performs task and media analysis
     associated with aircrew qualification training per AFI 36-2201, AFI 36-2251,
     Management of Air Force Training Systems, AFMAN 36-2234, consistent with the
     applicable ATS contract (see applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 1).
     2.1.8.3. The syllabus OPR is at HQ AETC. Contractor-developed syllabuses will be sent
     to the OPR for further action, coordination, and eventual approval.
  2.1.9. Additional Syllabus Requirements.
     2.1.9.1. As a minimum, syllabuses must be reviewed and documented current or revised
     within a 4 year cycle. Explain syllabus management functions and identify planned
     review dates by month and year. Document all syllabus reviews. If a syllabus is changed
     as a result of a review, the updated syllabus is the documentation. Syllabus review
     documentation will be standardized by division.
     2.1.9.2. The appropriate A2/3/10 division chief approves redacted syllabuses.
     2.1.9.3. AETC Flying Training Special Publications Website (AETC Bookstore). The
     website,    https://trss3.randolph.af.mil/bookstore/home/homePage.aspx,           contains
     current versions of syllabuses, courseware (as applicable), current status and the history
     of changes to courseware, and a link to access courseware change requests. Only
     authorized division personnel may upload syllabuses to the bookstore.
     2.1.9.4. Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA). Flying training
     program managers must ensure information for AETC flying training courses listed in
     ETCA are correct and up-to-date.
        2.1.9.4.1. The website, https://etca.randolph.af.mil, includes specific information
        for formal flying training courses conducted or managed by AETC. ETCA includes
        courses conducted or administered by the Air Force and reserve forces and serves as a
        reference for the Air Force, DoD, other military services, government agencies, and
        security assistance programs.
        2.1.9.4.2. The AETC flying training division responsible for a flying training
        syllabus identifies ETCA maintainers (syllabus managers, POCs, or other appointed
        personnel) to maintain current, correct, updated course and general information of the
        ETCA Website. Note: AFPC updates the ADSC information in ETCA for AETC
        flying training courses IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC).
        2.1.9.4.3. ETCA maintainers review and update course announcements annually.
        Whether or not announcement changes are required, ETCA maintainers must update
        the “Date Updated” field and check the “update” button so that the “last changed”
        date is updated. ETCA maintainers also use the ETCA software user manual and
        procedures on the ETCA Website to initiate, maintain, and remove course
        announcements.
 12                                                      AETCI36-2221 3 DECEMBER 2014


2.2. Syllabus Revision and Change. A syllabus revision is a rewrite with a new cover date that
supersedes and replaces the previous version. A syllabus change limits revised material and
maintains the cover date.
   2.2.1. Syllabus revisions are major modifications, affecting subject matter, instructional
   design, duration course flow and/or media. They involve full edit and reviews. In most
   cases, syllabus release is planned/timed to be used beginning on a specific date or with a
   specific class.
   2.2.2. Syllabus changes, referred to as either a Change or Interim Change, do not require a
   full review and use a specific change identification number (e.g. IC-1, IC-2, C-1, C-2, etc.).
       2.2.2.1. Use a Change Transmittal Page (CTP) that includes instructions for posting the
       change, a summary of the changes (normally a separate page from the CTP), and the new
       content pages to be inserted. Reference Attachment 2, Figure 2.1 for an example.
       2.2.2.2. After the change is posted, file the CTP and the summary of changes page at the
       end of the original document. For documents with more than one change, file all the
       CTPs and summary of changes at the back of the original document with the most recent
       first. Indicate changed material with stars and/or bars.
   2.2.3. Administrative changes (AC) do not affect the subject matter content, authority,
   purpose, application, and/or implementation of the publication. Since these types of changes
   are non-substantive, no coordination is required. Only OPRs may initiate ACs to their
   publications prior to A3F approval. Use a CTP IAW paragraph 2.2.2.1.
   2.2.4. For all flying training courses authorized foreign student attendance, the AETC flying
   training division responsible for a syllabus change, revision, or review will coordinate with
   the AETC Foreign Disclosure Division for a foreign disclosure review when new material is
   added to the course.
AETCI36-2221 3 DECEMBER 2014                                                                  13

                                       COURSEWARE

3.1. Types of Products. Courseware includes all instructional/training material, print or
electronic, including technical data, software products, textual materials, audio tapes, slides,
movies, video tapes, video discs, and other audiovisual materials. It includes student guides,
instructor guides, training manuals, examinations, supporting materials for simulator or trainer
missions, guidebooks, and Interactive Courseware (ICW). It may include computer simulations,
part-task trainers (PTT), and desktop training devices and associated supporting materials. The
purpose of courseware is to support flying training by providing instructors and students the
materials necessary to complete training. AETC government agencies and contractors preparing
courseware should follow prepared style guidance (see AETC Flying Training Special
Publications web page, ATS contractor prepared guidance) to ensure standardization of
courseware within each training program (not necessarily command-wide). However, effective
and efficient delivery of training remains paramount.
   3.2. Development Style Guidance.
   3.2.1. A variety of styles and formats are used for flying training courseware products within
   AETC flying training programs. As an aid to courseware production and standardization,
   guidelines and templates are on-line.
   3.2.2. Publication guidelines and templates are available on the AETC Flying Training
   Specials Publications Website (“electronic bookstore”). From “General Publications,” access
   either “Publications Guide” or “Publications Template.” The “Pubs Guide” page provides
   access to the AETC Handout on special publications. Courseware is password protected on
   this site. Graduate flying training courseware is MDS specific and will be standardized
   within that MDS.

               INTERNATIONAL FLYING TRAINING PUBLICATIONS

4.1. Syllabus Management.
   4.1.1. AETC international flying training syllabuses, as considered here, are dedicated to
   training only international students. This does not address other AETC flying training
   attended by international students.
   4.1.2. AFSAT POCs coordinate with AETC/A3F to develop international flying training
   syllabuses. Also coordinate syllabuses (and courseware) intended for international student
   use through AETC/IA. Define all waiver and deviation procedures in each syllabus.
   4.1.3. International students must meet established course entry prerequisites listed in the
   syllabus. The AFSAT program manager obtains the student records (or equivalents) prior to
   any formal training for verification. If required, A3F determines requisite equivalency. If
   additional training is required to meet prerequisites, establish a training plan approved by
   A3F prior to placing the student against a training quota unless attendance at another formal
   course is required.

                   applicable). Paragraph text may vary from here:
                   Section A—Syllabus Management.
                   1. Syllabus Interpretation.
                   This syllabus is directive and must be followed as written. If no clear syllabus
                   guidance exists, resolve the situation using the appropriate chain of command. If the
                   logical course of action appears to conflict with other directives, contact the
                   AETC/A3F OPR, DSN 487-XXXX.
AETCI36-2221 3 DECEMBER 2014                                                             25


           2. Syllabus Waiver.
           An approved syllabus waiver is required for any planned exception to the syllabus
           caused by special or unusual circumstances. Permanent or blanket waivers are not
           authorized, but should be suggested as syllabus changes. Do not accomplish or omit
           any training requested in a waiver until notification of approval. Maintain a
           permanent record of all approved waivers in the student’s training folder. Submit
           waiver requests electronically or in writing, on AETC Form 6, Waiver Request, to
           the following approval authorities:
            a. Provide the office symbols that approve/deny waiver requests for the specific
            syllabus. Forward the final outcome to the OPR.
            b. For senior officer syllabus and entry prerequisite waivers, provide the office
            symbols that approve/deny waiver requests for the specific syllabus. Forward the
            final outcome to the OPR.
           3. Syllabus Deviation and Omitted Training.
           A syllabus deviation is any unplanned variation from syllabus requirements such as
           prerequisite flow, turn times, and failure to comply with syllabus directives or
           requirements. Document all syllabus deviations in the student’s training folder. If a
           syllabus deviation results in omission of required training, the FTG/CC determines if
           the omitted training can be accomplished later in the syllabus flow without adversely
           affecting the quality of student training. Document FTG/CC-directed corrective
           actions and accomplishment of the omitted training in the student’s training folder.
           4. Additional information as required.
           Section B—Training Management.
           1. Fuel Conservation. (adjust to be MDS specific as necessary)
           AETC is committed to fuel conservation and maximizing training value for the
           command’s energy resource investment without compromising safety, air discipline,
           or negatively affecting the quality of our flying training product. Aircrews must
           manage aviation fuel as a limited and costly resource. Consider fuel optimization
           throughout all phases of mission planning and syllabus execution. Ensure ground
           operations (engine start times/taxi routing) and flight profiles are optimized for
           efficient fuel use. Adhere closely to syllabus average mission durations (AMD). Do
           not exceed these flight times except for extenuating circumstances or to meet
           training objectives.
           2. Voluntary Disenrollment/Drop on Request (DOR). (add paragraph as required
           for the type of training) USAF Rated officers and Career Enlisted Aviators (CEAs)
           who attempt to voluntarily disenroll from this course are processed IAW AFI 11-402,
           as supplemented. Non-rated personnel who attempt to DOR are processed IAW
           guidance found in the syllabus, AETCI 36-2205 applicable volume, or applicable
           AFIs.

                 AETC standard is authorized if not otherwise specifically defined in the syllabus.
                 Depict the CTS as a table describing the performance, condition, and standard for
                 each task. If all the conditions or standards are identical, define the conditions in the
                 “Tasks” paragraph. The CTS may be a stand-alone document, if so, state as
                 reference and refer to the location.
                 Additional sections or paragraphs as required for content and flow. Course maps, if
