Munitions Control will direct additional/changes once an approved AF Form 2407 is received
and signed by 56 EMS Maintenance Superintendent.

3.1.4. The Foreign Unit Munitions Expediter will contact Munitions Control to verify the
munitions quantities for the next day’s flying and verify against loaded quantity on the Luke
AFB Form 13. The required quantity will be delivered or downloaded to meet the next day’s
flying schedule. The Line Delivery Driver/Munitions Expediter will annotate all munitions
delivered (to include CATMs and AMAs) and all munitions downloaded/cross-loaded.

3.1.5. Weapons and Foreign Unit Munitions Expediters will provide Munitions Control with a
copy of all Luke AFB Form 26s and Luke AFB Form 13s at the end of each flying day. During
situations that direct input into CAS cannot be accomplished, all Line Delivery IMT Form 4331s
will also be delivered to Munitions Control.

3.1.6. BDU-33 safing blocks (C-Block) and impulse cartridges are accountable items. One
C-Block and streamer must be returned for each BDU-33 expended during reconciliation. The
quantity of impulse cartridges will be collected for each munitions type listed below.

3.2. Reconciliation discrepancy procedures:

3.2.1. Unresolved reconciliation discrepancies between the Weapons Expediter and the Foreign
Unit Munitions Expediter will be up-channeled to Munitions Control.

3.2.2. Munitions Control will notify the Munitions On-Duty Superintendent of unresolved
reconciliation discrepancies. Munitions On-Duty Superintendent will interface with AMU
weapons supervision and attempt to resolve the discrepancy. The Munitions On-Duty
Superintendent and AMU weapons supervision will attempt to determine if the disparity is due to
an error in reporting, documentation or physical loss. The Munitions and Weapons Expediter
will double check math and ensure all paperwork is accurate to include performing a physical
inventory of the items in question.

3.2.3. If it is determined an item has been physically lost, the AMU will initiate a lost item
report (if the situation warrants) in accordance with LAFBI 21-107.

3.2.4. Munitions Control will document the actions taken to resolve the discrepancy, and
munitions delivery may resume when cleared by the Munitions On-Duty Superintendent.

NOTE: Munitions delivery may continue to the affected AMU for all other munitions not
involved in the reconciliation discrepancy. Example: If the BDU-33 count cannot be reconciled,
chaff/flare, 20mm and any other support may continue. BDU-33 support will remain suspended
until the above steps are completed.

4. 2.75-Inch Rocket Procedures:

4.1. Misfire suspected rockets:

4.1.1. All suspect rockets will be downloaded from aircraft by weapons load crew personnel.
The load crew will also place a black X, launcher number, and aircraft tail number on the side of
the rocket motor with indelible ink. Suspect 2.75-inch rockets will be given back to the Line
Delivery personnel.

4.1.2. Line Delivery personnel will place first time misfires in “yellow” tubes in the rocket
module. IAW T.O. 11A11-24-7, Storage and Maintenance Procedures – Aircraft Rockets,
WP080, paragraph 2, suspect misfire rockets may be attempted to fire a maximum of two times.
A rocket marked with a single black X will be loaded and flown one more time.

NOTE: Under no conditions will a rocket marked with two black X’s be loaded and attempted
to fire a third time.

4.1.3. If a rocket is returned to service and fails to fire on the second attempt, the load crew will
mark with a second black X, date and tag suspect rockets with an AFTO Form 350 tag. The tag
will contain the following information: Rank/Name, launcher number, aircraft tail number, and
date the rocket was flown. The Line Delivery driver will place second failure rockets in “red”
tubes in the module. Upon return to the MSA, Line Delivery personnel will place the rocket in
the segregated unserviceable storage crate in the storage building awaiting final disposition
LUKEAFBI 21-601 28 JULY 2009                                                                   7

instruction. The Line Delivery driver will notify Munitions Control of quantity of “bad” rockets
returned.

4.2. MK66 rocket motors with a missing or damaged “foil” end shield are considered to have a
minor defect IAW 11A11-24-7, WP 050 00, Table 1, and is not cause for loading rejection IAW
1F-16C-33-1-2 section 8.7. Rockets with damaged or missing “foil” end shields will be
downloaded from the aircraft by weapons loading personnel and tagged with an AFTO Form 350
at the end-of-flying.

4.3. MK66 rocket motors with a torn or punctured weather seal is considered to have a major
defect IAW 11A11-24-7, WP 050 00, Table 1, and will be rejected from immediate use. Rockets
with a torn or punctured weather seal will be downloaded from the aircraft by weapons loading
personnel as soon as the discrepancy is discovered and properly tagged with an AFTO Form 350.
The tag will indicate the discrepancy and will contain the following information: Rank/Name,
launcher number, aircraft tail number, and date flown.

NOTE: A missing or damaged end shield and/or a torn or punctured weather seal are not
considered ground emergency conditions.

4.3. Line Delivery personnel will validate AFTO Form 350 and transport these rockets to the
designated munitions storage facility and download them into the appropriate containers for
repair.
