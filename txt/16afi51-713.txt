A2.1. The following is an example information letter for suppliers.
MEMORANDUM FOR SUPPLIERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
FROM: Tax Relief Office
SUBJECT: Tax-Relief Agreement
1.Pursuant to an agreement between HM Customs and Excise and the United States Visiting Forces
(USVF) a tax-relief programme has begun under the authority of Customs and Excise letter Priv 46/7
dated 9 September 1974, as amended. Under this programme, members of the USVF who meet the eligi-
bility requirements may make VAT-free purchases of goods and services from Suppliers in the United
Kingdom. The Tax-relief programme applies to purchases exceeding £200.00, inclusive of VAT.
2.The procedures to be followed in this program, although quite simple, must be followed strictly in order
for the purchases to qualify as eligible. The program is entirely voluntary for all parties. As a supplier,
you may wish to participate or you may decline participation in any particular sales transaction. Once you
decide to participate, you will prepare a price quote, which details the items or services being provided
and the price for each good or service without inclusion of VAT. This quote will include the delivery
address for the individual but will be addressed to Services Squadron (SVS). The purchaser will then
secure from the Services Tax-Relief Office, a US Government Cheque in the agreed upon amount, and a
VAT Exemption Certificate, which will explain to HM Customs and Excise why there was no VAT col-
lected on this transaction. The purchaser will give all of these documents to the supplier, and the supplier
will exchange the goods/services for the US Government check in the amount agreed upon.
3.If there are further questions, please contact you local VAT Advice and Enquiry Centre. This program
can be of great benefit to all parties involved.
