SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include the inclusion of Decision of the Comptroller General, Volume 58, page 81, DCG File B-
165731, November 16, 1978 ruling that FMS Trust Funds are considered “appropriated” funds
necessitating FMS case execution in accordance with United States (US) and DoD regulations
and procedures. Paragraph 2 is added to identify related guidance for applicability and
paragraph 3 redefines roles and responsibilities.
1. Overview. An FMS Dedicated Training Program assigns or allocates specific resources and
services for training and use by non-US personnel, e.g. an international flying training squadron.
 2                                                             AFI65-607 17 FEBRUARY 2011


It does not include FMS training programs for which a tuition rate is established based on cost
per student. Dedicated training programs may involve one or more nations who share the
resources and services of which the US may or may not be a participating nation. Training is not
traditionally provided to US personnel unless they will be providing instruction or other services
to the non-US personnel within the program (i.e. joint, cooperative, etc.).
2. Related Guidance. DoD policy, in fulfilling the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), Public
Law 90-629, as amended, codified at 22 United States Code (U.S.C.) 2751 et seq., and the
Foreign Assistance Act (FAA), Public Law 87-195, as amended, codified at 22 U.S.C. 2151 et
seq., and other legal authority requirements, dictates that Security Cooperation activities be
planned, programmed, budgeted and executed with the same high degree of attention and
efficiency as other integral DoD activities, combined with other DoD requirements and
implemented through standard DoD systems, facilities and procedures. According to 58
Comptroller General Decision 81 (1978), FMS Trust Funds deposited in the Treasury are
considered appropriated funds even though they are not annually appropriated by Congress. For
related financial management guidance and procedures see AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget
Guidance and Procedures, DoDFMR Volume 3, Chapter 8, Recording Commitments and
Obligations, AFI 65-608, Antideficiency Act Violations and Defense Finance and Accounting
Service, Columbus, (DFAS-DE) regulations.
