1. GENERAL INFORMATION.
     1.1. General Responsibilities for Weather Flight/ Airfield Services Element (WF/ ASE),
     Niagara Falls ARS.
NIAGARAFALLSARSI15-102 6 OCTOBER 2014                                                           3


     1.1.1. Niagara Falls ARS Weather Flight (WF) takes and disseminates surface weather
     observations; disseminates forecasted weather warnings (WW) and weather watches
     (WWATCH); issues and disseminates observed weather warnings (OWW); issues and
     disseminates observed weather advisories (OWA); provides miscellaneous weather
     services requested by the 914 AW, 107 AW, Niagara Falls ATC, 15th Operational
     Weather Squadron (OWS), NWS BUF, and miscellaneous agencies.
  1.2. Operational Support Requirements.
     1.2.1. Establish and coordinate all weather support requirements and procedures with the
     Weather Flight Supervisor.
         1.2.1.1. Notify the Weather Flight Supervisor of any changes in the weather support
         requirements.
     1.2.2. Unit Commanders will:
         1.2.2.1. Review this instruction at least annually for any changes in support
         requirements and have their supported agency coordinate these changes with the
         Weather Flight Supervisor.
2. WEATHER STATION OPERATIONS.
  2.1. General. The Weather Flight (WF) at Niagara Falls ARS is tasked as an Airfield
  Services Element (ASE) organization. Airfield services expand the traditional observing
  function at the airfield by infusing elements of the meteorological watch and resource
  protection roles. The airfield services element will function as the “eyes forward” for the
  servicing OWS and in many cases will serve as the primary point of contact for resource
  protection for an installation. Air Force flight operations rely heavily on the airfield support
  element for operational decision. WF/ASEs are responsible for taking and disseminating
  observations IAW AFI 15-128.
     2.1.1. The WF/ASE at Niagara Falls ARS is an Augmented Automated Surface
     Observing System (ASOS) location. A certified weather observer augments the ASOS
     during station operating hours.
  2.2. Location. The WF/ASE is located on the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority
  (NFTA) side of the airport (the Niagara Falls International Airport Terminal), a single story
  tower on the west end of the building.
  2.3. Operating Hours. Seven days a week, including holidays, from 0700L to 2300L. Duty
  hours can be extended with approval of the 914 OG/CC or his designated representative.
  2.4. Duty Priorities.
     2.4.1. Complete Emergency War Order tasking.
     2.4.2. Respond to aircraft/ground emergencies
     2.4.3. Record and disseminate surface weather observation longline.
     2.4.4. Disseminate WW, WWATCH, and OWA locally.
     2.4.5. Disseminate Urgent PIREPs/ PIREPs.
     2.4.6. METWATCH.
4                                         NIAGARAFALLSARSI15-102 6 OCTOBER 2014


       2.4.7. Eyes forward.
       2.4.8. Provide other services.
    2.5. Release of Weather Information. Operational security and communication security
    will be considered prior to any release of weather information.
       2.5.1. Specific restrictions do not exist on the dissemination of weather information to
       other military agencies. Information exchange between the WF/ASE and the NWS of
       Buffalo office is encouraged in the interest of public safety and resource protection.
       Routine working agreements will be maintained in writing from either agency.
       2.5.2. Support to other Non-DOD agencies/individuals.
          2.5.2.1. Weather information may be passed to Non-DOD agencies/individuals,
          which have a current Letter of Agreement (LOA) on file with the 914 AW Public
          Affairs Office.
          2.5.2.2. The WF/ASE will refer all other weather information requests from Non-
          DOD agencies/individuals to the 914 AW Public Affairs Office. This restriction does
          not include indirect routine weather information, which is passed on automated
          weather circuits, or information passed through the NWS in the interest of public
          safety.
    2.6. Observing Limitations. The following physical limitations may impact the
    representation of the observations.
       2.6.1. The official observation point is located at the end of the staircase leading up to
       the WF/ASE Office. The ATC Tower restricts the observers view to the east and
       southeast, any phenomena in this area, unless passed along to the observer by the ATC
       personnel may be missed.
       2.6.2. From the official observation point there are few adequate ground visibility
       reference markers from the southeast through the southwest. Unless ATC visibility values
       are relayed to the WF/ASE, accurate prevailing visibilities in these sectors are limited.
       2.6.3. Nearby lighting from the southeast to the southwest contaminates and complicates
       observation of nighttime sky conditions and approaching weather phenomena.
       2.6.4. Rapidly changing weather conditions may be missed, due to the delay in the
       ASOS transmitting time.
    2.7. Alternate Observing Location (AOL).
       2.7.1. In the event evacuation of the primary observation location becomes necessary the
       duty observer will relocate to the Airfield Management Office building 700. The
       requirements for evacuating the WF/ASE are listed, but are not limited to:
          2.7.1.1. Fire.
          2.7.1.2. High winds.
          2.7.1.3. Obstruction to the WF/ASE Office.
          2.7.1.4. Terrorist or Bomb Threat.
          2.7.1.5. Natural Gas Leak.
NIAGARAFALLSARSI15-102 6 OCTOBER 2014                                                         5


        2.7.1.6. Complete Communication and/or Power Outage.
     2.7.2. The observation elements may still be obtained from the ASOS sensors and values
     will not be estimated. If the observer is unable to contact the ASOS sensor all elements
     will be estimated.
     2.7.3. In the event that the building 700 becomes unusable, the alternate observing site
     may be established at any other suitable location.
        2.7.3.1. Minimum desired requirements for the alternate site are availability of
        power, a class A telephone, easy access to the outside, and a view of the runway.
     2.7.4. AOL observing Limitations.
        2.7.4.1. The buildings on base restrict the observers view to the northwest through
        the north. Any inclement weather approaching the base from this area may not be
        identified until it is already affecting the base.
  2.8. Severe Weather Procedures. The following outlines the responsibilities of the
  WF/ASE when there is a severe weather threat for Niagara Falls ARS.
     2.8.1. The duty observer will contact the Weather Flight Supervisor whenever the
     potential for severe weather is forecasted for or occurring at the Niagara Falls ARS or the
     immediate area.
     2.8.2. The Weather Flight Supervisor will assist in determining, if additional observing
     support is required and if observing support is needed after normal duty hours, IAW
     AFMAN 15-129.
     2.8.3. The WF/ASE will work closely with on-base personnel to ensure weather
     information is disseminated and safety is stressed.
     2.8.4. The WF/ASE will assist the 15 OWS in the METWATCH process; they will act as
     “eyes forward” for the 15 OWS by providing them with information necessary to issue,
     justify, and verify any issued WW.
     2.8.5. The WF/ASE will also provide the 15 OWS with severe weather reports not
     normally available through standard observation. These include reports from indigenous
     sources, local law enforcement, local news media, and unit personnel.
     2.8.6. A severe weather threat exists when a WA or WW is issued for the criteria listed
     in Attachment 2.
  2.9. Aircraft Mishap Procedures (ACFT MSHP).
     2.9.1. Upon notification of an ACFT MSHP the Weather Flight will:
        2.9.1.1. Record and disseminate a SPECI surface weather observation.
        2.9.1.2. Notify the 15 OWS that there has been an aircraft mishap at Niagara Falls
        ARS.
        2.9.1.3. The 15 OWS will perform an immediate data save on their systems.
        2.9.1.4. The WF/ASE will perform a data save on the ASOS.
        2.9.1.5. Assist all base agencies in the investigation of the aircraft mishap.

    2.10. In-Flight Emergency (IFE).
       2.10.1. Upon notification of an IFE the WF/ASE will:
           2.10.1.1. Record and disseminate a SPECI surface weather observation.
           2.10.1.2. Intensify weather watch to ensure maximum support to the aircraft in
           distress.
3. WEATHER OBSERVING SERVICES.
    3.1. Official Observation Location. The official point of observation is at the top of the
    landing on the northwest side of the WF/ASE Office.
    3.2. Continuous Weather Watch (CWW). The WF/ASE performs a CWW for the
    Niagara Falls ARS in accordance with FAA Order 7900.5B, Surface Weather Observing, and
    IAW AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations.
    3.3. Local Cooperative Weather Watch (LCWW). A LCWW has been established in
    which the ATC personnel will provide additional weather information to the observer when
    significant weather phenomena are detected. Significant phenomena includes, but are not
    limited to, tornadoes, funnel clouds, precipitation, lightning, reduced visibility, sector
    visibility, tower visibility, and pilot reports of Low Level Wind Shear (LLWS) and cloud
    heights.
    3.4. Surface Weather Observations. A certified weather observer augments the ASOS.
    The observer takes, records, and disseminates an official observation from the official
    observation location before every hour in accordance with FAA Order 7900.5B and AFMAN
    15-111. The following elements are observed by the WF/ASE Observer and disseminated
    longline for use by various agencies.
       3.4.1. Time. All time entries on surface weather observations will be in Coordinated
       Universal Time (UTC) commonly called “ZULU”.
       3.4.2. Wind Direction and Speed. The ASOS reads wind speed and direction every
       minute and displays a two minute average of the readings. Wind direction is reported to
       the nearest ten degrees and speed to the nearest whole knot. Wind direction is transmitted
       true for longline dissemination and magnetic for local dissemination.
       3.4.3. Prevailing Visibility. This is defined as the greatest visibility equaled or exceeded
       in at least half of the horizontal circle not necessarily continuous. Prevailing visibility is a
       visual determination made by the observer. Obstruction to vision will be determined by
       the observer and reported when the prevailing visibility is six statute miles or less, except
       in the case of precipitation, which is reported when it occurs. All visibilities are reported
       in statute miles.
       3.4.4. Runway Visual Range. Runway Visual Range is an instrumentally derived value
       that represents the horizontal distance that a pilot can see down the runway.
       3.4.5. Weather and Obstruction to Vision. This consists of both weather and non-weather
       phenomena, which are observed and/or restrict visibility.
       3.4.6. Sky Conditions. This consists of sky coverage (Clear (SKC) = 0/8, FEW = 1/8-2/8
       of the sky covered, Scattered (SCT) = 3/8-4/8 of the sky covered, Broken (BKN) = 5/8-
NIAGARAFALLSARSI15-102 6 OCTOBER 2014                                                        7


     7/8 of the sky covered, Overcast (OVC) = 8/8 of the sky covered) and the height above
     ground level (AGL) in hundreds of feet. The lowest layer at which 5/8 of the sky or more
     is covered is the ceiling. Heights of ceilings less than 12,000 feet may be measured using
     a laser beam ceilometer. When measurements cannot be obtained, ceiling heights are
     determined visually or from aircraft flying in the local area.
     3.4.7. Temperature and Dew Point. Instantaneous reading of the temperature and dew
     point are reported in degrees Celsius.
     3.4.8. Altimeter Setting (ALSTG). Altimeter setting values are determined by averaging
     the three ASOS barometric pressure sensor readings. Altimeter Setting is reported to the
     nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury.
     3.4.9. Sea-Level Pressure (SLP). This is the atmospheric pressure at mean sea level
     empirically determined from the average of the three ASOS sensor readings. Sea-Level
     Pressure is reported in millibars.
     3.4.10. Remarks. All supplemental criteria specified in AFMAN 15-111, Table 3.1 will
     be disseminated on all observations to present a more precise picture of existing weather
     conditions.
  3.5. Types of Weather Observations.
     3.5.1. Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR). METAR observations are taken
     between 47- 53 minutes past the hour. The specific contents of a METAR observation are
     listed in paragraph 3.4.
     3.5.2. Aviation Select Special Weather Report (SPECI). Special Observations are taken
     to report significant changes in weather elements at units, which are required to transmit
     surface observations on longline circuits. SPECI observation criteria for Niagara Falls
     ARS are listed in Attachment 3.
4. METWATCH, WEATHER ADVISORIES, WATCHES, AND WARNINGS.
  4.1. General. Certain weather conditions endanger property or life, pose a safety hazard, or
  adversely affect a supported agency’s operations. The WF/ASE, 15 OWS, and NWS BUF
  will monitor for these conditions and notify the duty observer when these conditions are
  observed or forecasted. The WF/ASE will relay this information to the appropriate agencies.
  4.2. METWATCH.
     4.2.1. General. The process of monitoring changing weather conditions and informing
     supported agencies that established weather conditions could affect their operations or
     pose a threat to property or life.
     4.2.2. The Weather Flight, IAW AFMAN 15-129V2 will act as an “eyes forward”
     function to the 15th OWS and provide the 15 OWS with significant information
     concerning local area weather conditions.
  4.3. Observed Weather Advisory (OWA). A special notice provided to the supported
  agency when an established weather condition that could affect operations is occurring. The
  WF/ASE issues and disseminates all OWA. The OWA criteria for Niagara Falls ARS are
  listed in Attachment 4.
8                                          NIAGARAFALLSARSI15-102 6 OCTOBER 2014


    4.4. Weather Watch (WWATCH)/ National Weather Service Weather Watch (NWS
    WWATCH). A weather watch is an informational message to supported agencies that
    conditions are favorable for the formation of threatening weather. WWATCH’s are generally
    issued prior to weather warnings and are intended to provide advance notice of potentially
    significant weather. WA’s will be issued for Niagara Falls ARS by the 15 OWS, Scott AFB
    (WWATCH) and for Niagara County by the NWS BUF (NWS WWATCH); all
    WWATCH’s listed in attachments 5 and 6 will be relayed to support agencies by the
    WF/ASE. WWATCH’s will be cancelled when the potential no longer exists or when
    upgraded to a weather warning. WWATCH/NWS WWATCH criteria for Niagara Falls ARS
    are listed in Attachment 5 and Attachment 6.
    4.5. Observed Weather Warning (OWW). An observed weather warning will be issued
    by the WF/ASE during normal operating hours, for lightning within 5 NM of the airfield
    complex.
       4.5.1. The WF/ ASE will notify the 15 OWS and the local ATC when issuing all OWW
       for lightning within 5NM of the airfield complex.
    4.6. Weather Warning (WW). A weather warning is a special notice provided to supported
    customers that alerts them to weather conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life
    or property. The WF/ASE will include the element of concern, forecast time of occurrence
    for Forecasted WW, or observed time of occurrence of Observed WW, and duration for

  8.1. General. The Weather Equipment at the WF/ASE Office is owned by the Federal
  Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Air Force (AF).
  8.2. Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS).
     8.2.1. The ASOS is owned by the FAA and augmented by an AF certified weather
     observer contractor during normal hours of operations and is a stand-alone system during
     non-operational hours. The ASOS sensors are located on the eastern half of runway 28R,
     off to the south-side. The pressure sensors and main frame are located in the FCT tower.
     The ASOS continuously monitors and displays current weather conditions. It can
     accurately measure wind speed and direction, temperature, dew point, altimeter,
     barometric pressure, cloud heights, present weather conditions (e.g., rain, snow, etc),
     liquid precipitation amounts at a single point at and above the sensors.
        8.2.1.1. Temperature and dew point are measured in Fahrenheit and Celsius.
        8.2.1.2. Wind Speed and Direction. Wind speed is measured to the nearest whole
        knots. Wind direction is from which the wind is blowing, reported in true direction to
        the nearest 10 degree longline and magnetic direction to the nearest 10 degrees
        locally.
        8.2.1.3. Barometric pressure and altimeter settings are measured in millibars and
        inches respectively.
        8.2.1.4. Visibility is measured in increments of 1/16th of a statute mile (SM), up to
        10 SM.
        8.2.1.5. Cloud base is reported in feet above ground level (AGL).
        8.2.1.6. Liquid precipitation is measured to the nearest 1/100th of an inch.
     8.2.2. ASOS Limitations. The ASOS has many limitations, it cannot report weather
     conditions occurring away from the systems sensors, but occurring at other locations on
12                                        NIAGARAFALLSARSI15-102 6 OCTOBER 2014


     the airfield (e.g., tornadoes, lightning, visibility and sky condition throughout the entire
     celestial dome, hail, freezing drizzle, blowing snow, etc).
         8.2.2.1. Sky Condition Limitations. Due to the use of the ASOS system sky
         conditions reports may not be completely representative of the actual sky condition.
         8.2.2.2. Only one FEW layer may be reported.
         8.2.2.3. Only three layers of clouds can be reported below 12,000 feet.
         8.2.2.4. Due to the transmission time of the ASOS system, rapidly changing sky
         condition reports may be delayed.
  8.3. METWATCH Computer System.
     8.3.1. The METWATCH computer system is used by the duty observer to monitor
     changing weather conditions, approaching inclement weather conditions, and Weather
     Warnings/ Watches/ Advisories issued for the Niagara Falls ARS.
     8.3.2. The system is located in the observing section of the Weather Flight.
  8.4. Equipment Restoral.
