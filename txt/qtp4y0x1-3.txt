     Supercedes QTP4Y0X1-3, September 2001
Introduction _____________________________________________i

       Volume 3, Clinical Skills - Chairside Assisting, Qualification Training Package
(QTP) contains modules on the preparation of restorative materials and the
performance of chairside assisting duties with general dentistry, oral surgery,
prosthodontic, endodontic, periodontic, prosthodontic, and examination procedures.
This QTP is designed to enhance 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level OJT of dental assistant
personnel. All eight volumes are intended to be used by trainees, trainers, supervisors,
and task certifiers. Before initiating any training you should review your
responsibilities--as a supervisor/trainer--for conducting on-the-job training (OJT) per
AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.

        QTPs are designed to help you conduct and evaluate your field training. Once
you begin upgrade training you’re required to use the QTPs. QTPs provide continuity
to the trainee’s upgrade training and are divided into the following volumes: 1) Basic
Skills; 2) Clinical Skills - Radiology; 3) Clinical Skills - Chairside Assisting; 4)
Clinical Skills - Preventive Dentistry; 5) Patient Administration – Procedures and
Programs; 6) Logistics Management; 7) Clinic Management, and 8) Supervision and
Training. The QTP modules were written to assist you in preparing for and
conducting training. You must use the QTP modules for training when either: 1) the
STS task is a core task (minimum qualification for the specialty); or 2) you have
identified the STS task as a requirement of the trainee’s job. Each module segments
the major tasks into teachable elements. Your goal is to provide enough training and
guidance so trainees can do all task related steps, without assistance, while meeting
local requirements for speed and accuracy. QTPs also aid OJT task certifiers in
evaluating the trainees demonstrated performance. If you have local training
requirements not covered by a QTP module you should develop “steps in
performance” and “performance checklists” that support and standardize those tasks.

         Accompanying each volume of QTPs is a qualification training progress
record. This QTP record serves as a document to record the date the trainee completes
each module. Individuals in qualification/upgrade training must have this QTP
progress record filed in their OJT folder. Use and annotation of this progress record
are similar to current OJT documentation. When you are satisfied the trainee meets
standards, as prescribed in the QTP performance checklist, you must document and
initial each task completion date in column 2B of the Specialty Training Standard
(STS) and the “date completed” column in the QTP progress record. If a person is
being recertified on a task that is supported by a QTP you must use that module to
complete the recertification process.

        Typically, you will manage each module by first, training the tasks and then,
evaluating performance. Your local steps in performance may vary from the method
listed in the QTP module. If this is the case, you are authorized to make changes to
the first half of each module, (i.e., steps in task performance); however, the
“performance checklist” is considered a standard and cannot be altered. You may
Introduction _____________________________________________ii

train each QTP volume/module in any sequence; however, when conducting training
use an organized and methodical approach. This will reduce your training time and
enhance your efforts.

        When beginning any training process you should first, review the procedures in
each module with the trainee. Second, direct the trainee to review the training
references listed to prepare for task performance. Third, go through the steps in task
performance with the trainee, allowing enough time to adequately train each step
(some modules may take longer to teach). Fourth, evaluate the trainees work at each
critical step--using the performance checklist at this point will be helpful. Fifth,
evaluate the trainee’s performance and provide feedback on any areas for
improvement. Finally, when the trainee has successfully completed the task you must
document and initial both the STS and the QTP progress record. If the trainee does
not accomplish the module, conduct follow-up instruction until the trainee
successfully completes the task.

        The QTP project goal of the 381 TRS/XWAA, Sheppard AFB TX, is to
publish a useable document for trainers and trainees. You are encouraged to write-in
changes or revisions to the QTPs. A corrections/improvements letter is located on the
last page of each QTP volume.

service in this publication is for informational purposes only and does not imply
