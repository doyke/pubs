SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. This
instruction applies many updates to new office symbols, reflecting the new HQ Air Force
 2                                                            AFISRAI33-117 11 APRIL 2011


Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency structure, as well as updating the 668th
Alteration and Installation Squadron (ALIS) responsibilities.
1. Overview. AFISRA E&I capability is vital to National Security Agency (NSA) Information
Technology (IT) and mission systems programs. This instruction formalizes how E&I work will
be planned, programmed, and budgeted. E&I work is generally funded through the Consolidated
Cryptologic Program (CCP).
     1.1. Requirements for CCP E&I work will come from NSA or HQ AFISRA/A6. NSA
     requirements are generally associated with new requirements or upgrades to mission or IT
     projects. HQ AFISRA requirements are generally associated with headquarters support
     initiatives, DoD and Air Force downward directed, or HQ AFISRA units. HQ AFISRA field
     unit requirements are generally associated with major system changes within their respective
     facility.
2. Roles and Responsibilities.
     2.1. HQ AFISRA/A6.
        2.1.1. Is responsible for HQ AFISRA E&I oversight and is designated as the AFISRA
        E&I Program Management Office. HQ AFISRA/A6 is accountable to NSA for planning,
        programming, and budgeting of all HQ AFISRA E&I resources. Oversight, as outlined
        above, will ensure the NSA CCP funds for E&I requirements are properly allocated,
        accounted for, and meet the intended mission requirements.

        Fee For Service requirements.
        2.1.3. Prepares and distributes an E&I data call for communication infrastructure
        requirement to all AFISRA organizations semi-annually. Requirements may be
        submitted by official message, email, or memorandum. If requirements support NSA
        mission systems, additional documentation is prepared through the NSA REMEDY ticket
        process.
        2.1.4. Reviews and validates HQ AFISRA and external customer generated E&I
        requirements.
        2.1.5. Works closely with NSA to ensure proper program funding is available.
