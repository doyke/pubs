                                          Chapter 2

                     CARGO ROUTING AND MOVEMENT POLICY

2.1. Introduction. Air Force Transportation Officers (TOs) and TMFs will use DOD 4500.9-
R, DTR, Parts II, III, V and VI as their primary guide to direct their organization’s shipping
activities. This document is a supplement to the DTR and provides the TMF and other AF
Transportation shipping activities amplification, interpretation and exceptions to DOD shipping
rules. There are many AF programs, tests and other efforts to enhance the movement of
material throughout the AF Supply Chain and this document is set up to explain these AF
unique Transportation solutions without duplicating instructions found in the DTR.
   2.1.1. The Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS) use is mandatory for all Air
   Force traffic management cargo movement functions and is the CSAF IDS directed system
   used for wing-level deployment, contingency passenger and cargo processing. GATES can
   be used in place of CMOS for deployment air manifesting at AMC strategic ports/onload
   locations (see paragraph 3.9.2.1.1).
   2.1.1. (AFSPC) Patrick AFB, FL will use Global Air Transportation Execution System
   (GATES) as the primary manifesting system to manifest wing-level deployment, contingency
   passenger and cargo processing.
   2.1.2. Deployable CMOS (DCMOS) use is mandatory for deployed cargo movement
   activities.
2.2. Establishing Priorities of AF Shipments. Transportation Priority (TP) and applicable
Time Definite Delivery Standards are found in DOD 4140.1-R (DoD Supply Chain Materiel
Management Regulation), Appendix 8. TMFs and other AF shippers will follow the
instructions identified in DTR Part II Paragraph 203-B.3. for establishing movement priorities
for AF Shipments. http://www.transcom.mil/j5/pt/dtrpart2/dtr_part_ii_203.pdf.
   2.2.1. Air Force shipment planners assign the transportation priority based on the supply
   priority designator and/or RDD printed on DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt
   Document, DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document, or Memorandum
   for non-MILSTRIP shipments. See Table 3.1 for converting the supply priority designator
   for MILSTRIP shipments, or Table 3.2 for converting customer RDD for non-MILSTRIP
   shipments, to the appropriate transportation priority (TP).
2.3. Air Force Expedited Service. The AF has determined that certain material (identified
by Project Code and/or other data on the issue document—DD Form 1348-1A, DD Form 1149
etc.) must be moved in accordance with Table 2.1 time standards. The following shipment
categories will be afforded expedited service (sustainment or retrograde):
   2.3.1. TP-1 with N**/999 RDD and eligible for small parcel express service
   2.3.2. Agile Logistics (project code 858)
   2.3.3. Two Level Maintenance (2LM—project code 879)
   2.3.4. Rapid Parts Movement (RPM—project code 880)
   2.3.5. Source of Repair (SOR)

NOTES:
1. Materiel Management and Cargo Movement collective processing standard is 24 hours. This
time starts when Materiel Management or Cargo Movement receives an item for shipment
processing and ends when the selected carrier receipts for pick up. For 2LM items, 24-hour
Materiel Management/Cargo Movement standard starts when Materiel Management or Cargo
Movement receives a not reparable this station (NRTS) item from Maintenance for processing.
2. Transit time is calculated from the time stated in specific contracts/tenders, or from the time
consignor releases shipment to carrier, or from the time AMC receives shipment from
consignor when the consignor and POE are co-located, to time of delivery to ultimate destination.
2.4. Mode/Method Eligibility. Mode is a category of movement (e.g., air, surface) and
method is a means of movement within a mode, such as motor or rail, AMC channel, small
package air carrier, or SEAVAN. See DTR Part II, Appendix GG for complete list of
mode/method codes and descriptions. The TO/Shipment planners determine the appropriate
mode/method and select the carrier to move the materiel to destination consistent with the
delivery requirement. When on-time delivery is not achievable, TO will select carrier/mode with
closest performance to target RDD, preferably one that does not exceed the target RDD.
   2.4.1. Air. The TO must move AF Expedited shipments via door-to-door commercial air
   express carrier service when eligible. Other TP2 shipments coded 777 or 555 can move door-
   to-door air express when this method proves more cost effective than AMC. Rates for
   comparing WWX and channel airlift over high volume routes are available on AMC’s
   website https://private.amc.af.mil/A4/WWX/wwx.htm. Current year AMC rates for all
   channels are available at http://public.transcom.mil/j8/fin/rates_homepage.cfm. Use
   AMC channel service when shipment characteristics preclude movement by commercial
   carrier express service, or host nation customs does not permit entry by a commercial
   method.
   2.4.2. Surface. TP-3 is shipped via surface modes. TP-3 shipments are not air eligible except
   for items with short expiration dates to include whole blood, perishable subsistence,
   biological, batteries, required refrigeration, radioactive, and like items. Shippers must
   ensure the ATCMD properly identifies these exceptional TP-3 shipments.
       2.4.2.1. Commercial air or expedited ground service-modes/methods may be selected
       when the cost is equal to or less than the normal surface cost mode/method.
       2.4.2.2. Deferred Airfreight (TP-4), via AMC, is a possible alternative to surface
       movement, depending on space considerations.
   2.4.3. Deferred Airfreight/TP-4. TP-4 is non-air-eligible materiel moving by military
   air on a space-available basis at or near the surface/sealift cost. This includes movement of
   household goods to non-hardlift areas. TOs are encouraged to request deferred
   airfreight/TP-4 for cargo movement. Pre-clearance must be received from the ACA or port
   before cargo is shipped to the port for TP-4 movement. Clearance of deferred airfreight
   requires that TP-4 be shown in the priority field of the ATCMD. TP-4 must also be shown
   in the priority block of the shipping label. Hazardous, explosive and material requiring
   special handling intransit cannot be shipped as TP-4 without the prior approval of HQ
   AMC/A4TC. See DTR Part II for further guidance.

2.5. Carrier Selection. The TO/Shipment planners will apply best value carrier criteria to the
maximum extent possible when making carrier selections. Refer to Attachment 1, Terms; and
DTR, Part II, Definitions, for additional best value guidance.
     2.5.1. For domestic shipments, carriers must be Power Track capable. This is accomplished
     by carriers establishing a Trading Partner Agreement with US Bank. See DTR Part II,
     Paragraph 212-C2e.
     2.5.2. Carriers, other than USPS, must have an approved tender of service or contract on
     file (hard copy or electronic) with AMC, GSA, or Surface Deployment and Distribution
     Command (SDDC). Local air shipment procedures can be established when the TO can
     document a negative critical mission impact to justify non-usage of AMC-
     arranged/operated/negotiated airlift. Certain contracts specify mandatory use, with
     exceptions noted. Select other carriers, not within the scope of a contract, using best value
     criteria defined in DTR Part II. TOs may use approved munitions carriers, who have FAK
     rates on file, when it is determined by risk assessment decision guidance in DTR, Part II,
     that certain types of general commodities should be afforded added protection services.
     These items include inert (non-explosive) and other non-hazardous items with new
     technology, high value, or by design may be perceived by the public to be hazardous.
     2.5.3. Commercial air express small-package delivery service through approved AMC
     contracts and tenders is the norm for Air Force Expedited shipments to meet Air Force
     sustainment goals. Use AMC approved contracts, tenders, or operating airlift channels for
     other airlift eligible shipments between CONUS/OCONUS and within OCONUS.
     2.5.4. DOD Domestic Express Small Package Service (DESPS)-formerly GSA Multiple
     Award             Schedule               Blanket             Purchase           Agreement
     (https://amclg.scott.af.mil/don/domexpress/spsindex.html). High priority shipments that
     meet the DESPS terms, will move via DOD DESPS carrier(s) to DOD and contract addresses
     to/from CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. The DESPS provides time-definite,
     door-to-door, domestic express delivery of letters and small packages. No single package
     may exceed 150 pounds gross weight. Therefore, Air Force Expedited shipments destined to/
     from CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico should be moving by a DESPS
     carrier(s) from pick-up to delivery at the consigned destination. See Paragraph 5.12
        2.5.4.1. The DOD is a mandatory user of the DOD DESPS, EXCEPT in the following
        instances:
            2.5.4.1.1. DOD shipments between 0 and 500 miles from origin.
            2.5.4.1.2. DOD shipments under DOD contracts in effect prior to award of this
            contract until expiration of the existing contracts or agreements.
            2.5.4.1.3. When required by wartime contingency operations.
            2.5.4.1.4. When shipments are outside the scope of the contract.
            2.5.4.1.5. Individual shipments with a gross weight of 151 pounds or more are
            outside the scope of this contract.
     2.5.5. AMC        Worldwide     Express      (WWX)        Small     Package     Contract
     (https://private.amc.af.mil/A4/WWX/wwx.htm). WWX is an AMC commercial contract
     that provides time-definite, door-to-door, international express delivery of letters and
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                       21


   small packages. No single package may exceed 150 pounds gross weight. Service is
   provided from CONUS (includes Alaska/ Hawaii/Puerto Rico) to OCONUS, OCONUS to
   CONUS (retrograde routes) and OCONUS to OCONUS (lateral routes).
      2.5.5.1. DOD is a mandatory user of WWX.
      2.5.5.2. Classified shipments are not authorized for movement by AMC WWX contract
      service.
      2.5.5.3. Movement of hazardous material (HAZMAT) by WWX contract service is
      restricted. HAZMAT is not covered under WWX basic services. However, very limited
      HAZMAT service is available. If a carrier handles HAZMAT as part of their regular
      commercial practice, then the government is authorized to use that service. If used, the
      DoD customer will be charged the WWX rate, plus an accessorial fee from the carrier’s
      commercial service guide.
      2.5.5.4. Where two or more contract carriers are authorized to serve the same region,
      use best value criteria as specified in DTR Part II to award shipments. Equal sharing of
      tonnage IS NOT a requirement.
      2.5.5.5. Shippers must provide an in the clear address to ensure delivery. OCONUS
      APOs, FPOs, and PO box numbers are not acceptable for WWX shipments. Foreign
      postal     codes    must      be     used      and     may      be     found   at:
      http://www.bitboost.com/ref/international-address-formats.html#Formats.
2.6. Export/Import of Goods
   2.6.1. US Import. To ensure shipments flow through US Customs, OCONUS shipping
   offices must provide the following information on all commercial air shipments.
      2.6.1.1. Airway Bill. The first line of the shipper block must identify United States Air
      Force as the shipper followed by the shipper unit. The consignee block must
      start with United States      (sponsoring military service) followed by the recipient
      name and address. Providing the sponsoring component command is critical on shipments
      consigned to commercial contractors and vendors.
      2.6.1.2. Commercial Invoices. The commercial invoice will be printed on Air Force
      letterhead to ensure US Customs can easily identify the shipment as a DOD shipment.
      Shipper and consignee information must reflect the sponsoring component command
      per Paragraph 2.6.1.1, a clear detailed description of the item, item value, and a
      statement of ownership, i.e., Property of the United States Government.
      2.6.1.3. American Goods Returned (AGR). US Customs requires a statement
      identifying AGR assets be printed on the commercial invoice. The complete statement
      can be found in 19 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 10.103 at website:
      http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html#page1.
   2.6.2. US Export. To ensure host nation customs clearance and routing requirements are met,
   refer to DTR, Part V. The DTR, DOD 4500.54G, DoD Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG), CFR
   Titles and Customs Bulletins can be accessed at the following USTRANSCOM
   website: https://business.transcom.mil/j5/j5p/customs/dodcustoms.cfm.
22                                            AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


        2.6.2.1. Accurate cargo descriptions and complete addresses are essential
        requirements for all international shipments of DOD property, especially when
        commercial transportation is used.
            2.6.2.1.1. Use of terms such as Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), Said to Contain
            (STC), Freight All Kinds (FAK), Consolidated Cargo, General Merchandise, or
            No Description (Blank) are not acceptable for customs clearance purposes. Also
            avoid generic descriptions such as “aircraft part,” which can cause delays in the
            customs clearance process. Use the most descriptive available nomenclature based
            on NSN, part number, or other data presented by supply activity or vendor.
            2.6.2.1.2. For shipments to DOD activities, the correct consignee address can be
            found in the DODAAC database at https://dodaac.wpafb.af.mil listed in the
            Department of Defense Activity Address Directory (DODAAD). Use the in-
            the-clear name of the consignee as well as the required DODAAC address.
        2.6.2.2. In accordance with 22 CFR 120.5, the export of articles covered by the U.S.
        Munitions List (USML) is regulated by the Department of State, except as indicated
        otherwise in the subchapter. If the item is on the USML, it requires a Shipper’s Export
        Declaration (SED) for export. If it is not on the USML (i.e., a general commodity), then
        no SED is required IAW 15 CFR 30.52. See DTR Part V, Para 508-D for additional
        information, including how to determine if the item is on the USML or not
        (http://www.transcom.mil/j5/ppt/dtrart5/dtr_part_v_504_508.pdf).
2.7. In-transit Visibility (ITV) Program. The Air Force is committed to ITV principles and
is determined to improve ITV source data timeliness and quality to support the War Fighter. ITV
is the ability to track the identity, status, and location of DOD units, and non-unit cargo
(excluding bulk petroleum, oils, and lubricants) and passengers; medical patients; and personal
property from origin to consignee or destination across the range of military operations. The
DoD ITV tool is the Global Transportation Network (GTN). Shippers should establish GTN
accounts for tracking cargo shipments. GTN effectiveness and reliability is based on our ability
to provide accurate and timely source transportation data. ITV integrity must be maintained by
providing data feeds to GTN according to the following standards:
     2.7.1. Two hours for all intratheater and CONUS non-unit cargo movements (all modes).
     2.7.2. One hour for all unit personnel and equipment movements.
     2.7.3. One hour for all sustainment air cargo movements.
2.8. Increased Liability Coverage and Excess Valuation. The purpose of purchasing
increased shipment liability coverage or declaring excess valuation is to increase the loss and/or
damage recovery when it is in the best interests of the Government. Specific liability terms,
conditions and rules must be known for each commercial carrier or contractor doing business.
     2.8.1. The Government is normally considered a self-insurer. Requirements to purchase
     additional coverage should be minimal. Consider increased liability coverage or excess
     valuation for prototype and one-of-a-kind items.
     2.8.2. TOs must know the shipment unit commodity and value to effectively protect the
     Government interests. The cost of buying or increasing the level of protective service may
     outweigh a decision to buy increased liability coverage or excess valuation. In addition, the
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         23


  maximum amount of automatic carrier coverage for loss or damage (no accessorial charges)
  must also be known before determining a course of action.
  2.8.3. Small package express carriers/contractors are not always the most economical
  method of transport when determining if the added cost to purchase increased liability
  coverage or excess valuation is a sound decision. Use of small package carrier service, that is
  mandatory and meets Air Force Expedited shipment requirements, will not be waived for the
  purpose of purchasing increased carrier coverage by other methods.

                                            Chapter 3

               SHIPPER, TRANSHIPPER, AND RECEIVER PROCEDURES

3.1. Processing Material for Shipment. The TO processes two types of shipments:
     3.1.1. MILSTRIP Shipments (DD Form 1348-1A). MILSTRIP shipments are processed
     through the base level supply system and CMOS. Use DD Form 1348-1A as the shipment
     planning worksheet for MILSTRIP shipments. Cargo Movement Section action begins on
     MILSTRIP shipments when documentation and materiel are accepted from Materiel
     Management Section. The Cargo Movement Section in-checker may accept originating base
     Materiel Management Section materiel as documented. A piece count is not required unless
     the materiel is classified, hazardous, pilferable, high-value (see Attachment 1),
     999/NMCS/MICAP, or it is obvious the count is different from what is documented. Use an
     electronic signature for materiel where the capability exists, i.e., CMOS or the Supply Asset
     Tracking System.
     3.1.2. Non-MILSTRIP Shipments. Non-MILSTRIP shipments are those presented to the
     TMF for shipment that are not processed through the base level supply system. Normally,
     the organization requesting shipment is responsible to deliver their cargo to the Cargo
     Movement staging area. Shipment planners may use DD Form 1149, DD Form 250, or a
     memorandum from the unit to process non-MILSTRIP shipments. Shipment processing
     time starts when an activity offers a shipment to the Cargo Movement Element for
     shipping. Shipments that are pre-packaged by the shipper can be accepted by the TO
     without an additional piece count as long as the shipping documentation includes the
     statement “Customer Provided Piece Count.”
        3.1.2.1. When DD Form 1149 is used, all shippers, including Guard and Reserve, must
        use the Logistics Support Office’s automated DD 1149 System, hosted on their Web-
        Server at https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/LG/LSO/lol/. All shippers
        currently using an automated management system to create shipping documents may
        continue to do so (e.g. PMEL and engine managers). The CMOS diskette program
        should be utilized in instances when the AFMC LSO System is unavailable. Attachment
        2 provides manual DD Form 1149 instructions for users without computer access.
        3.1.2.2. Review and comply with carrier selection criteria contained in Paragraph 2.5
        Commercial air or expedited ground service modes/methods will be selected when the
        cost is equal to or less than the normal surface cost.
        3.1.2.3. Review and comply with shipment clearance procedures contained in
        Paragraph 3.4 TMFs must submit the ATCMD data to the ACA and receive
        confirmation prior to release of the material to the port.
3.2. Assigning Transportation Priority
     3.2.1. MILSTRIP Shipments. Use Table 3.1 to assign the correct Transportation Priority
     and determine shipment options.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                       25

NOTES:
1. RDD 999 identifies shipments having the most urgent need. It is assigned to NMCS materiel
with a supply priority designator of 01-03, and consigned to U.S. Forces overseas and
CONUS forces alerted for deployment within 30 days of the requisition date. RDD 999 may
not be applied to FMS, Military Assistance Program grant aid, or to retrograde movements.
EXCEPTION: Retrograde aircraft engines will have an RDD of 999.
2. RDD 777 with one of the Air Force Expedited project codes (Paragraph 2.3) should be
moved by express service when eligible. Use AMC or fastest available means when not eligible
for express service. A list of current US Air Force Project Codes and Nicknames can be accessed
on     the     AFMC/A4           web     site    at     https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-

NOTES:
1. *Shippers must provide justification when requesting expedited transportation. Justification
will include signature of a competent authority (e.g., Squadron Commander). This may be
included on the DD Form 1149, or attached memorandum. The TO may waive this
requirement in repetitive or other justifiable customer situations. Items subject to airlift
challenge as shown in Paragraph 11.3.3.1 should typically not be assigned RDD 999.
2. RDD 999 is assigned for air eligible items that are in non-mission capable status, or are
essential to support/repair non-mission capable status assets. Examples of shipments
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        27


typically assigned a RDD of 999 would include lateral support for a weapons system, parts for a
broken fire truck, and similar cases.
3.3. Shipment Planning. Shipment planners determine best value mode/method and select the
carrier to move the materiel to destination consistent with the delivery requirement. The
shipment planner must consider all of the following:
   3.3.1. Shipment identification. Check commodity characteristics.
   3.3.2. Transportation Priority. See Paragraph 3.2
   3.3.3. Consignee location and receiving capability. Consult the SDDC on-line web Terminal
   Facilities Guide (TFG) at https://eta.sddc.army.mil.
   3.3.4. Consignee DOD Activity Address Code (DODAAC) and clear-text address. A
   DODAAC is a 6-position code that identifies a unit’s mailing, shipping, and billing addresses
   used for requisitioning and shipping material. Air Force DODAACs begin with the letters
   “E”,     “F”,     or   “J.”    For    specific    DODAAC         information,     refer    to
   https://dodaac.wpafb.af.mil. If the consignee does not have an assigned DODAAC, the
   non-specific DODAAC F00000 (F plus five zeros) is used. The clear text address of the
   consignee must then be entered on the TCMD as trailer data
   3.3.5. Mode/Method. Shipment planners must comply with Paragraph 2.4
   3.3.6. Movement time standards. See Paragraph 2.3, Table 2.1 and DODR 4140.1-R,
   Attachment 8.
   3.3.7. Special handling needs. See Chapter 4 and Chapter 5.
   3.3.8. Shipment funding and TAC or fund cite assignment. See Chapter 7.
   3.3.9. CONUS - Appropriate National Motor Freight Classification (NMFC) number and
   commodity code. Refer to current SDDC Freight Traffic Rules Publication
   (http://www.sddc.army.mil/public/Global+Cargo+Distribution/). The NMFC number is
   in Block 6 and type cargo code used with the NMFC number is in Block 8 of the DD Form
   1348-1A.
   3.3.10. If shipment requires clearance into an air or water terminal for DTS movement, see
   Paragraph 3.4 for Air Force clearance requirements. Also see DTR Part II, Paragraph
   203-B19 for additional information.
   3.3.11. International Shipments. See Paragraph 2.6
       3.3.11.1. “Customs Only” GBL for shipments to Korea. See Paragraph 6.2.4 This does
       not apply to FMS shipments.
       3.3.11.2. See Paragraph 6.2.5 for shipments to Canada.
       3.3.11.3. OCONUS to CONUS shipments using unit/base O&M funds. OCONUS
       shipping activities must complete the ATCMD to include a miscellaneous trailer data
       record (T_9) with the Standard Document Number (SDN) and Line of Accounting
       (LOA) on all shipments moving under unit/base O&M funds. See Paragraph 7.2.5 for
       additional information. AMC CONUS aerial ports will use the SDN and LOA for onward
       CONUS movement using the CBL payment process under Power Track. On the first T_9
       line enter the letters "SDN" followed by the data. Next enter letters "LOA: followed by
28                                           AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


        data. Use as many T_9's as necessary. Enter a sequence number beginning with one for
        each T_9 entry.
     3.3.12. Selection of Best Value Carrier. See Paragraph 2.5 and Attachment 1, Terms.
     3.3.13. Movement by United States Postal Service (USPS). Make mail movements according
     to DOD4525.8-M/AF Supplement 1, DoD Official Mail Manual. TOs should consider use
     of USPS as they would any other authorized carrier. Absence of ITV capabilities may
     constrain the use of this method for movement. Before using USPS, check with your postal
     representative for availability of ITV service. See Paragraph 5.3.2 for use of USPS for
     movement of small quantities of small arms.
     3.3.14. Ensure a TCN is assigned to every shipment. TCN guidance can be found in DTR
     Part II, Appendix L (http://www.transcom.mil/j5/pt/dtrpart2/dtr_part_ii_app_l.pdf). Use
     the following TCN guidance for non-MILSTRIP shipments.
        3.3.14.1. TCNs for non-MILSTRIP Shipments: Place a record of the transaction into
        your locally developed TCN system. The information should include but is not limited to
        the following:
            3.3.14.1.1. Date--Julian
            3.3.14.1.2. TCN--17 digit alphanumeric code constructed according to DTR, Part II.
            3.3.14.1.3. RDD--A calendar date that specifies when materiel is actually required to
            be delivered to the requisitioner. The RDD field may contain 999, N--, E--, 444, 555
            or 777 to indicate expedited handling required. A blank RDD field indicates routine
            handling.
            3.3.14.1.4. From--The activity offering the materiel for shipment.
            3.3.14.1.5. To--DODAAC of the Consignee or the "in-the-clear-" address of the
            recipient. See Note 1.
            3.3.14.1.6. Mode--Mode code taken from DTR, Part II
            3.3.14.1.7. Remarks--Example name and phone number of person and activity
            directing or authorizing shipment.
        3.3.14.2. Example of TCN Record:
NOTE: OCONUS small package contract carrier services shipments must reflect the
international foreign postal code (zip) of the consignee.
     3.3.15. Shipment Consolidation. Consolidate shipments to the maximum extent possible,
     consistent with delivery requirements, time standards, and DTR direction.
        3.3.15.1. Consolidate shipments using the following criteria:
            3.3.15.1.1. Do not consolidate serviceable and unserviceable materiel.
            3.3.15.1.2. Must have the same TAC or fund citation.
            3.3.15.1.3. Must be compatible with other materiel.
            3.3.15.1.4. Must be consigned to the same ultimate consignee.
            3.3.15.1.5. Must not impact commercial express movement eligibility.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          29


          3.3.15.1.6. Do not consolidate different project codes.
      3.3.15.2. Consolidated 999/NMCS/MICAP shipments must meet the following
      additional conditions.
          3.3.15.2.1. No delay in movement occurs for any item.
          3.3.15.2.2. Must maintain ITV over each TCN.
      3.3.15.3. FMS Consolidation. The following conditions apply to FMS in addition to the
      above:
          3.3.15.3.1. Have the same U.S. Service Code.
          3.3.15.3.2. Must be the same recipient country.

          3.3.15.3.5. Must have the same Delivery Term Code (DTC).
3.4. Shipment Clearance Requirements.
   3.4.1. CONUS Clearance Requirements. The TO must clear shipments moving on military
   owned or arranged airlift and sealift through the appropriate clearance agency prior to
   movement to the aerial or water port of embarkation (APOE or WPOE). See Paragraph
   3.4.1.1.2 for airlift clearance exceptions and Paragraph 3.4.4.1 for sealift clearance
   exceptions. Refer to the DTR, Part II, for the appropriate air and water clearance authorities.
      3.4.1.1. AFMC LSO/LOLA, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, plans and executes the Air
      Force ACA functions for CONUS originating shipments planned for AMC channel lift
      to overseas points. Operational functions are delegated to the two regional ACA
      Shipper Service Liaison Offices (S SLO) co-located with AMC at Dover AF B,
      DE, (ACA-E ast) and Travis AFB, CA, (ACA-West). The responsibilities of the
      SSLO include but are not limited to coordinating movement to the APOE with both
      shipper and project managers; maintaining visibility over cleared air and surface cargo;
      providing shipment status to tracer requests; assisting in the resolution of cargo
      discrepancies; enforcing SDT savings programs such as air challenges; use of deferred
      airfreight and performing cargo pre-clearance for shipments requiring special handling.
      Shipments that are not properly cleared through the SSLO, diversion to surface
      transportation or turn-in to a Defense Reutilization Management Office could occur. See
      DTR, Part II, Air Clearance Authority appendix for the SSLO hours of operation.
          3.4.1.1.1. Use the fastest means available when transmitting the ATCMD to the
          appropriate SSLO. Air Force Bases will use CMOS to clear shipments. If no other
          automated means are available or if CMOS is down, shippers will use website
          (http://www.pats.wpafb.af.mil/atcmd/index.cfm)       to     submit    ATCMDs
          electronically.
          3.4.1.1.2. The following exceptions require that the shipper fax an ATCMD to the
          ACA prior to releasing the shipment unless the shipper is using the website
          ATCMD form in instances cited below. If the website is not being used for cargo
          clearance, then ALL of the shipments listed below must be faxed to the ACA.
30                                           AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


               3.4.1.1.2.1. Explosives. Shipments of explosives may be subject to an explosive
               clearance number, which the ACA must obtain for the shipper prior to release of
               shipment. Annotate explosive clearance numbers on the Military Shipping
               Label. Web users clearing explosives will receive a screen message to hold the
               shipment until contacted by the ACA.
               3.4.1.1.2.2. Dog Shipments (military working dogs with handler). The
               ATCMD will include the dog's name, ID tag number, type of dog (i.e., drug,
               explosive, patrol), and handler's name and rank. Also, indicate on the trailer
               records how the dog and handler will arrive at the aerial port (commercial
               flight number). Dog shipments must be spaced blocked through AMC by the
               shipping activity. Website users will be prompted to enter the mission number on
               which the dog and handler are space blocked. For CMOS users, enter the mission
               number on a T_9 line. As long as all the above information is entered to the
               ATCMD web form, the shipment is cleared for airlift.
               3.4.1.1.2.3. Courier shipments. Include name and rank of courier(s). As long as
               all the required information is entered to the ATCMD web form, the shipment is
               cleared for airlift.
               3.4.1.1.2.4. Ration shipments may be cleared through the ATCMD web form as
               long as trailer records identify icing and other special handling requirements.
               3.4.1.1.2.5. Blood medical emergency shipments must be faxed to the ACA.
               3.4.1.1.2.6. Household goods shipments to other than hardlift areas with
               message of approval from JPPSO-SAT must be faxed to the ACA, unless being
               cleared as deferred airfreight/TP-4.
            3.4.1.1.3. For AMC airlift, send the ATCMD to the appropriate CONUS service
            ACA or OCONUS designated theater ACA via e-mail or fax. The preferred method
            is by electronic transmission. See DTR, Part II, and OCONUS MAJCOM guidance.
            The LSO website listed in Paragraph 3.4.1.1.1 may be used to clear shipments
            through the USAFE ACAs.
            3.4.1.1.4. For CONUS export sealift, send the ATCMD to SDDC Operations
            Center, Ocean Cargo Clearance Authority (OCCA) booking office located at Fort
            Eustis, VA. For OCONUS sealift requirements send to the appropriate Theater CDR
            designated Water Clearance Authority (WCA). Use the SDDC provided Integrated
            Booking System software or submit on DD Form 1086, Export Traffic Release
            Request. The preferred method is by electronic transmission.
     3.4.2. Clearance of Shipments into CONUS Military Air Terminals. The TO requests ACA
     clearance of cargo planned for AMC channel airlift prior to cargo release to the APOE. To
     request a clearance, submit the ATCMD data to the sponsoring service ACA. DTR, Part II
     contains specific clearance instructions.
        3.4.2.1. The Air Force ACA clears or challenges the request for air movement. The
        requisitioner has up to two calendar days to justify airlift of challenged shipments. The
        shipping TO will hold the shipment pending the challenge decision by the ACA. In the
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         31


       event airlift justification is insufficient, the TO will divert the shipment to surface
       movement.
       3.4.2.2. Air Force sponsored TP-1 and TP-2 shipments are airlift eligible. TP-3 is not air
       eligible, except for short expiration date items (see Paragraph 2.4.2). The most current
       airlift eligibility and challenge procedures are accessed from website https://www.afmc-
       mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/LG/LSO/lol/, click on Export Cargo Movement. See
       Paragraph 11.3 for the airlift eligibility and challenge procedures at time of publication
       of this AFI.
   3.4.3. Clearance of Shipments into OCONUS Military Air Terminals. The TO requests
   ACA clearance of cargo planned for movement from or within an overseas area via AMC
   prior to release of the materiel to the port. Furnish ATCMD data to the ACA designated by
   the overseas theater MAJCOM for acceptance decision. DTR, Part II, and MAJCOM
   procedures provide ACA responsibilities and guidance governing clearance of shipments
   into air terminals.
   3.4.4. Clearance of Shipments into CONUS Designated Water Terminals. The TO
   requests WCA clearance of cargo planned for direct delivery to a WPOE prior to
   movement of the materiel. WCA clears cargo offered for export from the CONUS ports.
   DTR, Part II, contains procedures for shipment clearance into water terminals.
       3.4.4.1. When sealift eligible cargo is not sufficient enough for container or flatrack
       loading at origin, send to a Consolidation and Containerization Point (CCP). These
       shipments are exempt from the normal sealift clearance process. DLA operates a CCP on
       the East and West Coast of the United States. The East Coast CCP is the Defense
       Distribution Depot Susquehanna, New Cumberland, PA, (DDSP-W25N14). The West
       Coast CCP is co-located with the Defense Distribution Depot San Joaquin, Tracy, CA,
       (DDJC-W62N2A). The DODAAD, identifies by DODAAC, those destinations served by
       each of the CCPs. The DTR, Part II, contains CCP procedures.
   3.4.5. Clearance of Shipments into OCONUS Designated Water Terminals. The TO requests
   WCA or OCCA clearance on all cargo planned for movement from or within an overseas area
   via MSC. Clearance procedures are in DTR, Part II.
3.5. Purchase of additional liability coverage or excess valuation. The following steps
should be considered when deciding on the purchase of additional cargo liability coverage or
excess valuation on individual shipment units:
   3.5.1. Identify commodity type and value of the shipment unit.
   3.5.2. Compare to the maximum liability or valuation coverage offered by the carrier’s
   contract, tariff or tender, without paying accessorial charges for added coverage.
   3.5.3. Determine the shipment cost difference with and without increased liability or excess
   valuation coverage.
   3.5.4. Consider cost of purchasing or increasing the level of protective service versus
   purchasing increased coverage.
   3.5.5. Consider your selected best value carrier’s track record on loss/damage.

3.6. Same Day Service (SDS) criteria. Care should be given in using SDS because this
service moves on scheduled commercial carriers so there is no guarantee the shipment will arrive
within 24-hours of pick up. Weight/size limits and other restrictions such as destinations, extra
cost, etc., will vary from carrier to carrier and must be verified prior to pick up. This service still
requires the need for the carrier to have an approved HQ AMC tender on file or HQ AMC
approval for a one-time rate quote. For exceptions, see DTR, Part II. The following criteria must
be met for use of SDS except when base O & M funds pay transportation. The base TO makes
the decision to use SDS when expenditure of base O & M funds are involved.
     3.6.1. Shipment must have an Agile Logistics Project Code or an RDD of 999, N           or E .
     3.6.2. SDS cannot be used if usage of the item will not occur before normal next day delivery
     service. This does not apply to shipments delivered to an aerial port for an overseas AMC
     flight.
     3.6.3. TO must certify that all services were performed. When TPB/PowerTrack is used, the
     TO will forward the certification shown in Figure 3.1 below to AFMC LSO/LOL(TPB),
     e-mail address AFMC/LSO.LOLF@wpafb.af.mil. If the certification is not received,
     charges will be borne by the hipper.

Figure 3.1. Certification of Same Day Service.




3.7. Express Carrier Shipment Documentation. The TCN must be entered in the shipper
reference field (17 positions) on the commercial bill of lading to provide ITV. The following
additional procedures will be used for TPB purposes:
     3.7.1. TCNs are automatically entered at CMOS sites using the standard Industry Information
     Processor (I2P) capability. I2P is described in Attachment 1.
     3.7.2. The TCN on the carrier waybill alerts the carrier tracking system to forward shipment
     information to DOD in-transit visibility systems as well as allow for TCN tracking using the
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                       33


   commercial carrier’s tracking system. The TCN links express carrier and shipper
   information systems and provides data for pipeline analysis.
   3.7.3. The billing TAC in the reference field will help track billing information and ensure
   invoices are sent to the correct paying office.
   3.7.4. For non-I2P transactions, enter the TCN in the first 17 positions of the field, enter
   one space, and then enter the TAC in positions 19-22. Spaces, other than the one between
   the TCN and TAC or additional characters not part of the TCN or TAC, should not be
   included. Data must be entered in this order either by using carrier-provided software or
   filling out the air waybill manually. An example of a correctly entered TCN and TAC:
   FB483382120189XXX F2RS (ensuring one blank space between “XXX” and “TAC”).
3.8. Releasing Freight
   3.8.1. REPSHIP. See Paragraph 5.10
   3.8.2. RFID. See Chapter 18.
   3.8.3. Billing. See Chapter 12.
3.9. In-transit Visibility (ITV). Refer to AFI 24-238, In-Transit Visibility (http://www.e-
publishing.af.mil/pubfiles/af/24/afi24-238/afi24-238.pdf).
   3.9.1. Non-Unit Move. Shippers will document all cargo/non-unit re-supply movements in
   CMOS.
   3.9.2. Contingency/Unit Move Deployment and Redeployment. ITV provides the
   Combatant Commander the ability to see forces moving to and within the theater. Good
   ITV enables the Combatant Commander to determine the location of specific units while in
   the DTS and to reprioritize or redirect movement in response to changing circumstances.
      3.9.2.1. Air Force locations will assure ITV of unit movement cargo as follows:
          3.9.2.1.1. At origin/ports of embarkation. Prepare commercial movement
          documentation as required using CMOS. If cargo is moving through the DTS and is
          destined for a POE, assure Advance Transportation Control and Movement
          Document (ATCMD) data is submitted to support receipt and onward movement.
          Prepare automated air manifests using CMOS, or at AMC aerial ports, Global Air
          Transportation Execution System (GATES). GATES is an IDS component for
          CONUS AMC Strategic Aerial Ports. (Note: AMC Strategic ports are defined in the
          DTR). Assure a diskette with the air manifest data accompanies the mission. This is
          also applicable when using Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft under control
          of the Joint Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC).
          3.9.2.1.2. At enroute locations. Access GATES to determine what is inbound.
          (NOTE: Until the GATES/CMOS interface becomes fully functional, the enroute
          location may need to rely on the inbound diskette to assist in remanifesting at
          transload (Intermediate Staging Base) locations. Receipt for cargo. Prepare
          automated air manifest using GATES. Assure a diskette with the air manifest data
          accompanies the mission.
          3.9.2.1.3. At destination/port of debarkation. Receipt for cargo. Prepare
          documentation for onward movement as required by mode. Prepare commercial
34                                            AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


            movement documentation using CMOS. Prepare air or truck manifests using
            GATES, at AMC operated locations, or CMOS. Assure a diskette with the air or
            truck manifest data accompanies the mission/vehicle.
            3.9.2.1.4. At final destination. Receipt for cargo using CMOS.
        3.9.2.2. The requirement for movement documentation applies to both Air Force and
        non-Air Force movement requirements. Non-Air Force units moving through Air Force
        systems (GATES or CMOS) will provide unit deployment data for cargo and
        passengers from TC-ACCIS, TC-AIMS II, MDSS II, or an importable Excel
        spreadsheet, as required in the DTR, Part III, Mobility.
        3.9.2.3. Accurate manifesting at origin/port of embarkation will enable enroute locations
        to electronically re-manifest. Automated manifests and the manifest diskettes must
        accurately reflect cargo/passenger content prior to aircraft departure.
        3.9.2.4. For specific unit move deployment ITV reporting procedures and requirements,
        see DTR, Part III, and AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution.
3.10. Receiving Freight. 999/NMCS/MICAP shipments are receipted and processed 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week.
     3.10.1. When the LRS Materiel Management Receiving Section or Cargo Movement
     Element receives cargo for base, tenant or contractor organizations, the items will be turned
     over to Pickup and Delivery in a timely manner for receipt to the ultimate consignees. If
     Pickup and Delivery is not used or unavailable, ultimate consignees are responsible to pick up
     their shipments in accordance with time standards shown in Table 3.3 below. Capability
     and resources permitting, Receiving Section or Cargo Movement personnel will develop
     local procedures to assist consignees in this process.

Table 3.3. Consignee Pickup Time Standards.
                         PRIORITY                 PICKUP TIME (Hours/Days)
                          999/MICAP/NMCS            12 Hours from notification
                             All other TP1                 2 duty days
                                  TP2                      3 duty days
                                  TP3                      5 duty days

        3.10.1.1. As a minimum, customers will accomplish the following when picking up
        property from
         TMF:

         PRINT NAME
         SIGN NAME
         UNIT
         CONTACT PHONE NO.
         DATE
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          35


       TIME
       (Electronic signature can be used in lieu of the preceding when capability exists).
   3.10.2. Receiving Section or Cargo Movement personnel will annotate on the receiving
   document the date, time and name of the person contacted for pick-up.
   3.10.3. TOs are responsible for training personnel on in-checking procedures. Personnel
   from certain organizations, because of the nature of their business, should be properly
   trained to receipt for shipments directly from commercial carriers. This training should
   include basic documentation rules, overage shortage and damages, and carrier performance.
   3.10.4. Off-loading Truckload Shipments. To the extent possible, truckload shipments
   should be off-loaded at the point of use or consignee facility. Personnel assigned to the Cargo
   Movement Section will assist consignees in quickly servicing commercial carriers and
   completing required documentation.
   3.10.5. When in-checking, the TO representative will acknowledge the number and condition
   of containers received, annotate shortages, damages, or other discrepancies on the carrier's
   freight bills and verify that the carrier has provided special services and equipment
   annotated on the bill of lading. Have the carrier representative acknowledge any
   annotations by signing the carrier delivery receipt and consignee copy. Take necessary
   action to correct discrepancies or file a claim against the carrier if appropriate. For
   misdirected shipments, refer to Chapter 10, Paragraph 10.10 for appropriate handling
   procedures.
3.11. Tracing Shipments and Reporting Discrepancies. See Chapter 10.
3.12. Other Shipment Requirements.
   3.12.1. Aircraft Engine Shipment and Receipt. The TO must process documentation on
   aircraft engines for movement according to T.O. 00-85-20, Engine Shipment Instructions.
   Commercial vehicles moving aircraft engines must have both an air-ride tractor and trailer in
   operating condition when required by T.O. 00-85-20. The TO and Base Engine Manager will
   develop local procedures to ensure engine shipment receipt process meets mission
   requirements. See Paragraph 3.2.1 Note: 1 for movement of retrograde aircraft engines.
   3.12.2. Munitions Shipment and Receipt. The TO must coordinate with installation
   munitions and safety personnel on local procedures to ensure proper documentation,
   movement, and receipt-handling instructions are available. See Paragraph 2.5.2 for
   guidance on carrier selection for inert (non-explosive) movements.
   3.12.3. Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE). TMDE are non-
   MILSTRIP shipments, usually assigned project code 571. Normally TMDE shipments are
   consigned to the destination TMF, with the Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory
   (PMEL) as the ultimate consignee. Shippers will prepare a DD Form 1149 and each package
   should have the appropriate PMEL Shipping Label attached. The TMF and PMEL will
   develop local processing procedures. For transportation funding, refer to the current fiscal
   year memorandum and logistics Tracker system website.
   3.12.4. SOR Shipment and Receipt. The TO at installations with a SOR must coordinate
   with SOR personnel on local procedures to ensure proper documentation, movement,
   and receipt-handling instructions are available.

3.13. Personal Property shipments in the DTS. DTR, Part II, and Part IV, JFTR Vol 1, JTR
Vol II, and AF supplement provide procedures, circumstances and conditions for moving
household goods, unaccompanied baggage, and privately-owned-vehicles at U.S.
Government expense. Controls similar to cargo apply when personal effects are moving in the
DTS.
3.14. Green Sheet Procedures. This is a process where specifically identified cargo in the
AMC system may gain movement precedence over other priority cargo of the sponsoring
Service, including 999 shipments. Use it when expedited movement of specific shipments is in
the national interest, and the ACA certifies that it as an operational necessity. Green Sheet
applies to the final destination APOD.
     3.14.1. Air Force CONUS activities submit AMC airlift export requests to the ACA,
     AFMC LSO/ LOLA, Wright Patterson AFB, OH (refer to Paragraph 3.4.1.1), and overseas
     activities submit to the designated theater ACA. The ACA is the only activity authorized to
     levy Green Sheet action with the aerial port. Blanket application for Green Sheet action is
     not authorized. HQ AMC must have Green Sheet procedures in place at all aerial ports.
     3.14.2. Green Sheet requests must include TCN, pieces, weight, cube, consignee DODAAC,
     APOE/ APOD and valid reason for Green Sheet action (i.e., aircraft down, work stoppage).
     Vague statements such as “urgently required” are not sufficient to warrant Green Sheet
     action. Customers must be specific regarding their urgency of need. The Green Sheet
     request memorandum must be signed by an O-6 or above.
     3.14.3. When necessary origin CONUS and en route OCONUS ACAs will Green Sheet
     cargo when justified and required by the shipper.
     3.14.4. CONUS and OCONUS ACA activities will ensure that AMC Green Sheet cargo from
     the origin or en route APOE to the final destination APOD. The responsible ACA for Green
     Sheeting cargo will ensure that Load Planning enters an alpha code “G” in the special
     priority field of the prime TCMD record and creates a miscellaneous information trailer
     record (Document Identifier Code T_1) containing the term “Green Sheet” as of (insert the
     GMT hour and date the code request was received) in record positions 54-74, for all AMC
     Forms 101, Green Sheet Request, received (AMCI 24-101, Volume 9, Air Terminal
     Operations Center, Section E, 20).
     3.14.5. AMC Load Planners will Green Sheet cargo from the APOE where the request is
     received through to the final destination APOD. AMC Load Planners at en route stops
     will ensure Green Sheeted cargo moves over other priority cargo of the sponsoring Service.
3.15. Purple Sheet Procedures. The Purple Sheet process authorizes specifically identified
cargo in the AMC system in-transit to the Combatant Command (COCOM) area of
responsibility (AOR) to gain movement precedence over other priority cargo in-transit to the
COCOM AOR, including 999 and Green Sheet shipments, regardless of service lane or arrival
date at the APOE. The COCOM requires the ability to prioritize sustainment cargo during Lines
of Communication (LOC) stress or during shifts of contingency/combat operations. The intent
is to outline a process for the supported combat command to prioritize sustainment cargo
already on hand at an APOE for subsequent flow into the COCOM area of responsibility
per the Defense Transportation Regulation, Part III, Chapter 304.2a(3). The COCOM utilizes
Purple Sheeting to expedite movement of specific shipment(s) of national interest and
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                             37


operational necessity. Purple Sheet applies from initial identification to the shipment’s final
destination APOD.
   3.15.1. The COCOM J4 approves Purple Sheet request and forwards to COCOM
   Deployment Distribution Operations Center (CDDOC). CDDOC will forward after
   coordination to the US Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Deployment
   Distribution Operation Center (DDOC). The DDOC tasks the 18 AF Tanker Airlift Control
   Center (TACC), who in turn tasks the applicable Aerial Port (APOE). The Aerial Port
   APOE will info the service Airlift Clearance Authority (ACA). No blanket shipment or
   plane load Purple Sheet request will be approved.
   3.15.2. Aerial Port procedures. The only authorized Purple Sheeting authority to the Aerial
   Ports will be the 18th AF TACC. Once the Aerial Port is tasked by the TACC the following
   actions will occur:
       3.15.2.1. The Air Terminal Operations Center (ATOC) coordinates the request with the
       applicable work centers (i.e., Load Planning, Capability Forecasting, or Air Freight) to
       confirm that the cargo is on hand at the APOE and movement ready.
       3.15.2.2. ATOC notifies the service ACA or Customer Service Branch (CSB) for CONUS
       ports of Purple Sheet cargo.
       3.15.2.3. If applicable the CSB or ACA changes the priority and RDD fields in the
       Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES) to read “1” “999” and enter the
       words “Purple Sheet as of XXXXZ” in the applicable trailer (TX1) data fields. If no
       CSB or ACA assistance is available, ATOC will direct the Air Freight section to
       accomplish the system changes. Since no special priority code exists for Purple Sheet
       cargo, adding the information to the trailer data fields above is key to identifying the
       cargo as Purple Sheet for ITV purposes.
       3.15.2.4. Stage loose shipments in a specific warehouse location for ramp services or
       task the Special Handling work center to upload. These shipments are high-visibility,
       so it is imperative that the Aerial Port leadership ensures expeditious and well-
       coordinated movement.
       3.15.2.5. Plan movement on the first available mission. Purple Sheet cargo will not
       displace cargo already manifested on departing aircraft, unless directed by TACC.
       3.15.2.6. Manifest Purple Sheeted cargo separately with markings “Purple Sheet Cargo.”
       3.15.2.7. Every effort will be made to release the cargo at its end destination as swiftly as
       possible upon aircraft arrival.
3.16. Cargo Inventories. TOs must inventory materiel awaiting movement to know what is on hand to
prevent delays and protect against loss. The TO will use locally developed procedures to document all
in-transit inventory and will act to rectify adverse inventory findings.
   3.16.1. Inventory classified cargo at the start of each working shift.
   3.16.2. Inventory other special handling cargo each day.
   3.16.3. Inventory and move daily, all 999/NMCS/MICAP/Agile Logistics/2LM/RPM/SOR cargo.
   3.16.4. Inventory all other cargo once per week.

                              HAZARDOUS MATERIALS (HM)

4.1. Hazardous Materials Definition. For the purposes of this AFI, hazardous materials are
substances or materials that the UN or DOT has determined are capable of posing an
unreasonable risk to health, safety, and property during transportation.
4.2. General Requirements. Transportation and Packaging personnel must comply with public
law, policy, agreements, and applicable international, federal, and military directives when
packaging, processing, handling, and shipping HM. Table 4.1 contains a list of directives and
certification requirements by mode. The list is comprehensive but not all-inclusive. Violations
of these directives could result in civil and criminal penalties and undue safety risks to the
general population. Hazardous substance shipments must comply with the same DOT and
military regulations required for any other HM. Overseas shippers moving HM to, from, and
within a foreign country must also comply with foreign country directives, applicable
international requirements and DECA/SOFA. Shippers are also required to develop and
maintain/update security plans as required. Inclusive in this plan is the requirement for security
awareness and training for each HAZMAT employee.
     4.2.1. Special Reporting Requirements. 49 CFR, paragraph 172.101, identifies hazardous
     substances and their reportable quantities. TOs must comply with special reporting
     requirements if there is a release of a reportable quantity of a hazardous substance. See 49
     CFR, paragraphs 171.15. and 171.16.

4.3. Hazardous Materials Procedures. Follow the Federal, agency, or departmental documents
regulating the mode of transportation. The Hazardous Materials Information Resource System
(HMIRS) provides guidance to personnel responsible for the packaging, handling, storage,
and transportation of hazardous materials. Use HMIRS as a complementary reference along
with, and not as a replacement for, existing regulations. HMIRS is available on the internet at
http://www.dlis.dla.mil/hmirs.
   4.3.1. Labeling Hazardous Materials. Apply the proper hazard label to the outside of the
   shipping container according to AFMAN 24-204(I) and 49 CFR. AFOSH Standard 48-12,
   paragraph 5d, identifies the labeling required by the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard
   29 CFR 1910.1200.
   4.3.2. Shipper Certification. International, federal, and military regulations require the
   shipper to certify that hazardous materials are properly identified, described, packaged,
   marked, labeled, and in proper condition for transportation. THIS INCLUDES
   HAZARDOUS             MATERIAL             GOVERNMENT            PURCHASE          CARD
   MICROPURCHASE SHIPMENTS. Depending on the mode/ method or whether the
   shipment moves by commercial or by military transportation, the specific language may vary
   and specific forms may be prescribed. Shippers are reminded that when transporting
   hazardous waste, hazardous waste manifests are required as well as appropriate EPA
   generator and transporter identification numbers.
   4.3.3. Preparing Aircraft/Vehicle/AGE Fuel Devices for Shipment. Drain and purge
   aircraft/vehicle/ AGE fuel equipment IAW T.O. procedures prior to shipment. Items shall
   not be accepted (inducted) into supply or transportation without documented proof
   (AFTO Form 20, Caution Tag, or other locally produced documentation) certifying that
   the equipment has been properly drained and purged. Purging for transportation is only
   required if the applicable T.O. requires it, or items that are containerized and not accessible in
   flight with a flash point below 100 degrees per AFMAN 24-204(I) (http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil/pubfiles/af/24/afman24-204(i)/afman24-204(i).pdf).              Ensure      the
   following conditions are met before offering aircraft/vehicle/AGE fuel devices for
   commercial and military transportation (air or surface):
       4.3.3.1. Ensure strict compliance with Tech Order procedures for draining and purging
       the fuel parts. Remove all excess purging fluid as required and ensure the part is
       completely cleaned. Annotate on the documentation “drained and purged” or “drained
       and not purged.” Include residue type (e.g. JP8) and volume remaining.
40                                            AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


        4.3.3.2. The AFTO Form 20 (or other documentation) must be signed (include printed
        full name) in the appropriate block or by the inspection stamp by personnel
        accomplishing the draining and purging procedures.
        4.3.3.3. Cover plates will not be placed on openings until the documentation is
        completed. Then properly cap and seal drain openings, open lines and fittings as specified
        in the item Tech Order.
        4.3.3.4. LRS Materiel Management Flight and the TO must ensure documentation is
        attached to the item(s), checked for completeness and signed (certifying the item is
        drained and purged) prior to turn-in. If hazards are suspected, frustrate the shipment and
        coordinate with appropriate maintenance, vehicle or fuels personnel to resolve. Only
        qualified technicians on the equipment in question will perform the required procedures
        to prepare equipment for shipment.
        4.3.3.5. If the T.O. data covering the parts/equipment does not require drain and/or
        purge procedures prior to shipping, then these parts do not require documented proof.
        This includes but is not limited to aircraft parts and aerospace ground equipment (AGE)
        containing hydraulic fluids, oils and lubricants (fluids non-hazardous for transportation).
        Certain aircraft parts received from Supply have fluid in them and are ready for
        installation on the aircraft. These fluids are essential for parts to operate.
        4.3.3.6. Any item containing residual fluid (fuel) must be packed in a greaseproof,
        waterproof sealed bag (MIL-DTL-117). Use of a proper barrier bag will prevent contact
        of residual fuel with the outer container and reduce petroleum odors. If reusing
        packaging, inspect for presence of residue or stains. If the packaging is stained from a
        petroleum product, do not reuse.
        4.3.3.7. Mark each outer container with the type of material and flash point for the
        purging fluid. This will help identify that odors are from non-regulated purging fluid and
        not from a hazardous material (flammable fuel).
4.4. Management of Hazardous Material Data. Packaging offices at each ALC must
complete transportation data sheets for all Air Force hazardous items they manage. Assistance
can be provided by contacting the Air Force Institute for Environment, Safety and
Occupational Health Risk Analysis (AFIERA), AFIERA/RSH, 2513 Kennedy Cir, Brooks
City-Base, TX. 78235-5116, DSN 240-6159, FAX DSN 240-2315.
4.5. Hazardous Waste. Package hazardous waste in containers authorized in the applicable
modal regulation (i.e., AFMAN 24-204(I) for military airlift, 49 CFR for domestic surface
movement, etc.). The Individual Generation Site (IGS) is primarily responsible for proper
packaging, labeling, marking, and preparing the hazardous waste manifest. Describe hazardous
waste material on the shipping papers by the proper shipping name identified in the HM table in
49 CFR, paragraph 172.101, or AFMAN 24-204(I), Table A4.1. (http://www.e-
publishing.af.mil/pubfiles/af/24/afman24-204(i)/afman24-204(i).pdf), preceded by the word
"Waste." Hazardous waste shipments must:
     4.5.1. Comply with HM rules. Refer to AFPAM 32-7043, Hazardous Waste Management
     Guide, paragraph 5.3
     4.5.2. The IGS must prepare a hazardous waste manifest IAW 40 CFR, Part 262, subpart B.

   subpart C (for hazardous waste shipments to California, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania).
   4.5.5. The IGS prepares a uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest on EPA Form 8700-
   22/22A or an applicable State Hazardous Waste Manifest for all hazardous waste shipments
   to be transported over public highways. The 40 CFR, part 262, Uniform Hazardous Waste
   Manifest and Instructions, gives detailed instructions for completing the form.
   4.5.6. Defense Reutilization & Marketing Offices (DRMOs) must maintain records on
   hazardous waste for which they have manifesting responsibility.
4.6. Radioactive Waste. Handle, document, ship, and dispose of radioactive waste in
accordance with the appropriate modal directive listed in AFI 40-201 Managing Radioactive
Materials in the US Air Force, and Tech Order 00-110N-2, Radioactive Waste Disposal. Do not
ship radioactive waste until it is cleared and has a control number issued by the Air Force
Radioactive and Mixed Waste Office (AL/ OEBZ), 2402 E. Drive, Brooks City-Base TX
78235-5114, DSN 240-1903/1804, Commercial (210) 536-1903/1904.
   4.6.1. The activity that generates the waste, with the installation radiation safety officer
   (RSO), initiates a written request for radioactive waste disposal instructions as
   specified in Tech Order 00-110N-2.
   4.6.2. The     TO      must     comply  with    AFMAN      24-204(I)    (http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil/pubfiles/af/24/afman24-204(i)/afman24-204(i).pdf) and 49 CFR when
   transporting radioactive waste.
4.7. Radioactive Commodities. TOs will package and ship radioactive commodities in
compliance with AFJI 23-504, Radioactive Commodities in the DOD Supply System. All
commodities must be properly packaged, marked, labeled, and certified before being offered to a
carrier.
4.8. Reshipment/Transshipment Procedures. HM, that has been previously packaged and
certified, must be thoroughly checked, and recertified as required, when originating as a new
shipment or changing to a different mode/method at a transship location. If there is any indication
that the HM package does not fully comply with federal, military or international
packaging/certification requirements, then frustrate the shipment and take action to ensure the
required compliance standards are met.
4.9. Secure Holding Areas (Formerly Safe Haven). See Chapter 5, Paragraph 5.14
4.10. Personnel Qualifications. Personnel who certify, prepare, handle, or inspect HM for
shipment must receive initial and subsequent refresher HM training according to Title 49, CFR.
The Commanding Officer or designated representative of units involved with the hazardous
material process ensures that:
   4.10.1. The designated representative is appointed in writing to include scope of authority.
42                                          AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009

     training according to 49 CFR, paragraph 172.704 and AFMAN 24-204(I), Paragraph 1.2.5.
4.11. DOT Special Permits (formerly Exemptions). The Hazardous Materials Safety and
Security Reauthorization Act of 2005 amended the Federal hazardous materials transportation
law by changing the term “exemption’ to “special permit.” DOT special permits waive 49 CFR
requirements on the basis of equivalent levels of safety. DOT special permits for packaging are
valid for domestic transportation of hazardous materials. They are not valid for international
shipments of hazardous materials covered by United Nations Performance Oriented Packaging
requirements. HQ SDDC will obtain DOT special permits for DOD. Special permits issued by
DOT are for a specific period of time. See 49 CFR, paragraph 107.109, Application for Renewal.
DOT special permit web site is located at: http://hazmat.dot.gov/sp_app/approvals/exsys.htm
4.11. (AFSPC) DOT Special Permits (formerly Exemptions). TO will submit a consolidated
DOT-SP Usage Report quarterly to AFSPC/A4R by email at the beginning of January, April,
July, and October. The report will contain the following data: DOT-SP number, number of
shipments made under the DOT-SP number and facts pertaining to any accident or incident
involving a shipment made using the DOT-SP number.
     4.11.1. The DTR requires annual submission of Report Control System: SDDC-158, DOT
     Special Permit Usage Report. TOs are responsible for tracking use of DOT special permits
     for their activity and submitting usage data to their MAJCOMs for consolidation. Activity
     reports are due to MAJCOMs not later than 10 July of each year. The reporting period is 1
     July through 30 June.
     4.11.2. MAJCOMs must prepare a consolidated report each year and submit it to AFMC
     LSO/LOT, 5215 Thurlow Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5540. AFMC
     LSO/LOT will finalize the report and forward it to HQ SDDC. MAJCOM consolidated
     reports are due to AFMC LSO/LOT not later than 20 July each year. AFMC LSO/LOT
     report is due to HQ SDDC not later than 30 July each year.
4.12. Competent Authority Approvals (CAA) and Hazard Classifications. A CAA is an
approval issued by a national agency responsible under its national law for the regulation of
hazardous materials transportation. These may also be referred to as "special approvals." The
US Competent Authority is the DOT. Specific requirements for packaging CAAs are contained
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                       43


in AFJI 24-210, Packaging of Hazardous Material and AFMAN 24-204(I). Requirements for
hazard classifications (sometimes referred to as CAAs) are contained in Tech Order 11A-1-
47, DOD Ammunition and Explosive Hazard Classification Procedures.
   4.12.1. (Added-AFSPC) TO will submit a consolidated CAA Usage Report quarterly to
   AFSPC/A4R by email at the beginning of January, April, July, and October. The report will
   contain the following data: CAA number, number of shipments made under the CAA and
   facts pertaining to any accident or incident involving a shipment made using the CAA
   number.
4.13. Certifications of Equivalency (COE). A COE is a certification that the proposed
packaging equals or exceeds the requirements of 49 CFR Parts 100-199. Use COEs as authority
for shipment by military air, if applicable. Specific requirements for COEs are contained in
AFJI 24-210 and AFMAN 24-204(I).
4.14. Documentation Retention. Per 49 CFR, paragraph 172.202, shipping documents (i.e.,
BOL, manifest) for Hazardous Waste shipments must be retained for 3 years after the material is
accepted by the initial carrier. For all other hazardous materials, shipping documents must be
retained for 375 days after the material is accepted by the initial carrier.

      CLASSIFIED AND PROTECTED CARGO AND ARMS, AMMUNITION, AND
                          EXPLOSIVES (AA&E)

5.1. Need for Special Procedures. Special procedures are necessary to prevent loss and
damage to classified and protected cargo during transportation. As a minimum, TOs must
comply with procedures described in this chapter and the standards prescribed in the DTR, Part
II, DOD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program; AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
Management; DOD 5220.22-R/AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Program Management; DOD
4525.8-M/AF Supplement 1, DoD Official Mail Manual; DOD 5105.38-M, Security Assistance
Management Manual; AFJAM 23-215, Reporting of Supply Discrepancies; AFI 33-201V5,
Controlled Cryptographic Items (CCI); AFGM 20-1, Air Force Guidance Memorandum on
Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel (NWRM) Management and MIL-STD-l29, Standard
Practice for Military Marking. The TO is to process and complete documentation as follows:
     5.1.1. Ensure each DD Form 1348-1A/DD Form 1149 issued for the shipment of classified,
     sensitive, and some controlled items shows the word "CLASSIFIED" or "SENSITIVE"
     followed by the applicable supply controlled item code. NWRM shipments will be stamped
     with the statement “Classified NWRM Item” or “Unclassified NWRM Item” in red ink. The
     DD Form 1348-1A, Issue/Receipt Document is the only shipment document authorized for
     shipping NWRM. The DD Form 1149 is not authorized for shipping NWRM except when
     necessary to meet DOE requirements.
     5.1.2. Use extra copies of the DD Form 1348-1A as a hand receipt in processing SECRET
     and SENSITIVE shipments prior to packaging. The DD Form 1149 serves as a hand
     receipt for non-MILSTRIP shipments.
     5.1.3. Provide hand-to-hand receipt control for classified, sensitive, and controlled
     shipments. The DD Form 1907, Signature and Tally Record, may be used for all receipt
     transactions. The TO may use the DD Form 1907 for internal control as a hand-to-hand
     receipt of classified or sensitive items. Equivalent carrier-furnished forms may be used as
     described in the DTR, Part II. The air/truck manifest may be used for military shipments if
     they adequately control the materiel being transferred. Exception will be for all movements
     to include NWRM via Domestic Express Small Parcel Service (DESPS).
     5.1.4. Shipments of classified material to the FMS purchaser are normally handled
     through DTS. However, if the FMS freight forwarder or a country-arranged pilot or vessel
     pick-up at the POE is indicated, obtain a copy of the country's Transportation Plan detailing
     the approved method of transportation. The Transportation Plan can be obtained from the
     Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) Command Country Manager, Wright-
     Patterson AFB, OH.
     5.1.5. Classified SECRET shipments will be afforded the same Transportation Protective
     Service (TPS) as SRC I/II AA&E. Classified CONFIDENTIAL or Classified CCI shipments
     will be provided the same security as SRC IV.
     5.1.6. The only routing options for classified secret or confidential, sensitive, NWRM and
     controlled shipments to/from OCONUS locations are AMC or USTRANSCOM DCD. The
     U.S. Postal Service will not be used to move NWRM shipments.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           45


  5.1.7. Attachment 6 AF Form 4387, Outbound Transportation Protective Service Materiel
  Checklist, provides a checklist for processing outbound TPS shipments. TOs must use
  Attachment 6 checklist to process TPS materiel for movement. Deviation from the
  checklist is not authorized. Certifiers must inspect and certify each task prior to forwarding
  to another TMF function and prior to shipment release to carrier. Certifications will be
  accomplished by a 7-level, 2T0 technical sergeant or above, or civilian equivalent. Waiver
  authority for a certified, 5-level staff sergeant will be at the LRS commander level. The
  individual performing tasks and the certifiers cannot be the same person.
  5.1.7. (AFSPC) TOs will use AFSPC Form 4387, Outbound Transportation Protective
  Service Material Checklist, when shipping outbound TPS shipments. Noncommissioned
  Officer In-Charge (NCOIC) signatures must be accomplished by at least a Staff Sergeant
  with a 5-level. The Certifier is ultimately responsible to verify that all steps are complete and
  error free by signing and dating the checklist prior to shipment release to carrier. This person
  must be a 2T0 Technical Sergeant or above, or civilian/contractor equivalent. This person
  cannot be the same person that signs as NCOIC. Waiver authority for a 2T0 5-level Staff
  Sergeant to be a Certifier will be at the squadron commander level.
  5.1.8. TOs will use Attachment 7 AF Form 4388, Receiving Transportation Protective
  Service Materiel Checklist, when receiving TPS shipments. The checklist must be
  accomplished in conjunction with in-checking process. It is not the intent to accomplish the
  form after the fact.
  5.1.8. (AFSPC) TOs will use AFSPC Form 4388, Receiving Transportation Protective
  Service Material Checklist, when receiving TPS shipments.
     5.1.8.1. NWRM assets will be in-checked immediately upon receipt and inspected to
     ensure seals are intact and there is no evidence of damage or tampering with the container
     and container marking match information on the movement documents. Only personnel
     appointed and certified IAW with paragraph1.5.5, shall process and in-check NWRM
     assets.
     5.1.8.2. If no discrepancies are detected, receiving personnel will legibly print name and
     sign (block letters: Last, FI, MI, Phone, and Organization) date and complete the AF
     Form 4388.
     5.1.8.3. The receiver must acknowledgement within 2 hours (CONUS) and 8 hours
     (OCONUS) of in-checking a receipt of NWRM. Transportation personnel will use
     official e-mail/fax to notify the consignor that the shipment has been received. The e-mail
     must include the TCN and exact quantity received.
     5.1.8.4. Shipping agency will acknowledge receipt of receipt notification, clear suspense
     file, and maintain all REPSHIP documents, 1348s and AF Form 4388s with the bill of
     lading or manifest pickup report for 10 years.
     5.1.8.5. If discrepancies are detected or the shipment is not received by the RDD, a TDR
     will be immediately initiated by the receiving activity.
     5.1.8.6. If the shipping agency does not receive confirmation of receipt by the RDD the
     shipping activity will initiate immediate tracer actions and notify the shipping
     NWRMAO.
46                                           AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


     5.1.9. For all NWRM shipments, the shipment originator will ensure shipping documents
     have:
        5.1.9.1. Item Nomenclature (item X) and the Controlled Inventory Item Code (CIIC) that
        match the item being shipped.
        5.1.9.2. Printed serial number list along with shipping document.
5.2. Description of Classified Material on a BOL. The TO protects NWRM classified and
protected cargo shipments from compromise and conceals the exact nature of materiel classified
SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL and classified/unclassified NWRM. The BOL description used by
the TO should accurately identify the shipment without disclosing the exact nature of the
material. It should give the same freight rate for the assessment of freight charges as the actual
material shipped.
     5.2.1. Never show security classification on copies of BOLs or documents attached to
     shipments.
     5.2.2. The TO provides a description to use on BOLs sent to a contractor for completion.
5.3. Controlled Inventory Item Codes (CIIC)/Physical Security Codes (PSC) and Mail
Handling Procedures. Table 5.1. provides the CIIC/PSC and the degree of protection risk
categories that are associated with that code. The CIIC or PSC is found in Block 9 of the DD
Form 1348-1A. The information provided in this attachment, used in conjunction with Table 5.2,
ensures that the proper level of protection will be assigned to an item during transportation.
     5.3.1. Risk category codes (e.g., Sensitivity Code, Security Code) use the item stock number
     and the FEDeral LOGistics (FED LOG) Data on Compact Disc. FED LOG is maintained
     by DLA, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084, DSN: 932-4725.
     5.3.2. Further guidance for moving SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL material by mail is
     in DOD5200.1R/AFI 31-401. DOD 4525.8-M/AF Supplement 1 restricts shipments to a
     packaged weight of 70 pounds or less and 108 inches in length and girth combined. USPS
     can also be used for shipments of small quantities (15 or less) of CAT II through IV small
     arms and Air Force M-16 weapons for both CONUS and OCONUS movements. Registered
     Mail/Return Receipt Requested is required. Note: AMC Airlift is the preferred method to
     ship classified Secret or Confidential, sensitive, and controlled material to and from
     OCONUS. If AMC cannot meet mission requirements, USPS can be used as an alternative.
     The TO must retain documentation certifying AMC was not able to meet mission
     requirements.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                            47

shipments are listed in Table 5.3 below. Signature and Tally Record Service (ST) is designed
to provide continuous tracking of shipments from origin to destination. It is considered a tracing
service, not a protective service, when used independently. The DD Form 1907 or equivalent
carrier-furnished signature and tally record is acceptable. TOs must ensure signature and tally
records reflect printed names and signatures for both drivers when dual driver protective service
is used. For additional information refer to DTR, Parts II and III.

Table 5.3. TPS Codes and Protection Requirements.




     5.4.1. For Minimum TPS for Sensitive AA&E and Classified Shipments, see DTR Part II.
5.5. Movement and Handling Requirements. TOs comply with the following requirements:
     5.5.1. Obtain in writing individuals authorized to sign for classified material within their
     organizations.
     5.5.2. Ship weapons and same caliber ammunition in separate containers. During
     contingency, deployment, or military operation other than war (MOOTW), weapons and
     same caliber ammunition can be moved on the same pallet as long as they are packaged in
     separate containers.
     5.5.3. Certify to the highest degree of TPS when more than one classification or security risk
     category shipments are consolidated on a mobility pallet.
     5.5.4. Ship missile rounds separately from launch and control equipment.
     5.5.5. Provide the same protection for firearms and ammunition scheduled for
     demilitarization and retrograde, as other shipments of AA&E.
     5.5.6. Process export shipments through military managed and operated air or ocean
     terminals.
     5.5.7. Store sensitive and controlled items in an approved security cage during any period of
     transportation delay.
     5.5.8. Select commercial carriers that provide single line-haul service from point of origin to
     destination when routing sensitive shipments. Trailer interchange service is acceptable
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         49


   providing the interchange carrier also provides the required service. Classified shipments
   moving internationally must be moved via AMC.
   5.5.9. If deploying and traveling commercially refer to DTR Part III, DoD Foreign
   Clearance Guide, and COCOM reporting instructions for weapons and ammunition
   movement guidance.
   5.5.10. Before releasing a shipment requiring TPS, ensure the driver possesses a valid
   operator’s license, medical examiner’s certificate, employee record card or similar
   document with the driver’s photograph. The TO must be able to verify a driver’s affiliation
   with the TSP named on the BL. DD FORM 626, Motor Vehicle Inspection (Transporting
   Hazardous Materiel), must be used and all blocks completed to ensure drivers have proper
   security clearances and valid driver’s licenses (see DTR, Part II).
5.6. Packaging Classified Material:
   5.6.1. If the classified material is an internal component of a packageable item of equipment,
   the outside shell or body may be considered as the inner enclosure provided it does not
   reveal classified information.
   5.6.2. If the classified material is an inaccessible internal component of a bulky item of
   equipment, the outside or body of the item may be considered to be a sufficient enclosure
   provided observation of it does not reveal classified information.
   5.6.3. If the classified material is an item or equipment that is not reasonably packageable
   and the shell or body is classified, it shall be concealed with an opaque covering that will
   hide all classified features.
   5.6.4. Specialized shipping containers, including closed cargo transporters, may be
   considered the outer wrapping or cover when used.
   5.6.5. Controlled and protected cargo (controlled, sensitive, classified, pilferable, NWRM)
   materiel shall be prepared for shipment, packaged and sealed in ways that minimize risk of
   accidental exposure or undetected deliberate compromise. The container shall not bear any
   classification markings or other unusual marks that might invite special attention to the fact
   that the contents are classified or protected cargo. Additional guidance can be found in DTR
   chapter 205 and DoD 5200.1-R. Mark and label IAW MIL-STD-129, which can be found at.

   and verifying controlled and protected cargo certify that items are properly classified,
   described, packaged, marked and labeled, and in proper condition for movement according to
   applicable regulations. Use AF Form 4387 for certification. Packers and certifiers include
   Technical Specialists, shipment originators and items packaged prior to delivery to the TO
   for movement.
      5.6.5.1. Do not mark exterior containers to indicate the security classification or TPS
      required. However, when a shipment goes by military airlift, DD Form 1387-2, Special
      Handling Data/Certification, must show the TPS required in Block 6. See DTR, PART
      II, Chapter 205, for 1387-2 preparation and distribution. Do not include item description
      (nomenclature) or any information that indicate the nature of the contents on the exterior
      of protected cargo. When shipping material that is both classified and hazardous, the
      shipper prepares and distributes a Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods, (DTR,
50                                            AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009

        replacement, and necessary destruction or obliteration of authorized tags and labels (i.e.
        999, MICAP, 777, etc) is accomplished while in-checking or shipping property
        unless required by directives to be retained (i.e. aircraft engines, ammunition, and
        hazardous materiel). All markings on shipping containers will be obliterated unless
        otherwise required by directives.
        5.6.5.2. For controlled, sensitive, classified, NWRM and pilferable items (except for
        FMS shipments), all shipping documentation shall be placed inside container. Do not
        include copies of the MSDS either in or on the shipment.
        5.6.5.3. NWRM shipment originator will label or stencil the exterior container/packaging
        with NSN clearly visible on the exterior of the outer package IAW MIL-STD-129.
        5.6.5.4. NWRM shipments will not be consolidated.

     contact 542 MSUG/GMBSCAD, Robins AFB, GA., DSN 468-3259, early in the
     procurement stages to identify necessary packaging issues.
     5.7.11. Repackaging Small Arms After Inspection, Exercise and Storage. Qualified
     packaging personnel will do the packaging. They must repackage weapons opened for
     exercises, or other reasons, within ten days of the exercises. Contact 542
     MSUG/GMBSCAD, Robins AFB, GA., DSN 468-3259 for requests on packaging waiver
     authority to deviate (follow paragraph 9.6.12 for additional guidance). Do not store
     packaging materials in the weapons storage area.
     5.7.12. Identification Markings for Small Arms. Mark each individual unit package, the
     intermediate and exterior containers IAW MIL-STD-129, paragraph 4.4.3.14. Do not attach
     packaging lists or other documents identifying the contents to the exterior container. Print
     the serial numbers for firearms shipments onto the DD Form 1348-1A or on a separate list or

   5.7.13. Do not apply these controls to items reduced to scrap or to parts and pieces that do
   not constitute complete firearms.
5.8. Explosives. AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, provides guidance on hazard
classification, firefighting, handling, transportation, storage, and compatibility of explosives.
Use only approved locations to store ammunition and explosives while in the DTS.
5.9. Escort Criteria of AA&E for Carrier Load/Off-Load and Base Surface
Movements. On-base escort of AA&E and classified material will be established and approved
by the Installation Security Council. Origin and destination TOs and transship/intransit locations
must be knowledgeable of their local Installation Security Plan for movement to/from the
processing or storage areas; to/from the carrier’s equipment; and to/from the surface and aircraft
load/off load locations. Escort selection should encompass consideration for who is best
qualified to take action in case of emergencies and the training expertise needed when
considering various levels of protective services. When using military ground transportation for
movement off base to field locations, deployments, etc., refer to AFI 31-101, The Air Force
Installation Security Program, or contact the Security Forces office for procedures.
5.10. Report of Shipment (REPSHIP). The origin shipping TO/approved contractor must send
a REPSHIP to the destination TO/approved contractor for all categories of material requiring
TPS per the DTR, Part II. REPSHIP formats and requirements are found in the DTR, Part II.
Origin TO/approved contractor must also send a REPSHIP to the destination receiving
TO/approved contractor, with an information copy to the receiving unit/activity, when registered
mail is the method of transportation. CONUS to CONUS shippers must use the DTTS II website
to transmit a REPSHIP to the final destination for all shipments that require Satellite Monitoring
Service (SNS). Shippers executing a REPSHIP for other than SNS shipments must utilize an
automated means (e.g., e-mail or FAX) to transmit the REPSHIP to final destination. A
REPSHIP is not required if an automated advanced shipment notice capability exists. All
NWRM shipments and receipts will have 100 percent REPSHIP notification and confirmation.
CONUS REPSHIP notifications will be made within 2 hours of actions taken. OCONUS
notifications will be made within 8 hours of actions taken. Additionally, for all NWRM
shipments, the TO shall notify the Consignee in advance of the shipment and the Consignee shall
acknowledge the ability to receive the shipment. The TO shall await positive acknowledgement
from the recipient before the shipment occurs.
5.10. (AFSPC) Report of Shipment (REPSHIP). Origin TO will produce a REPSHIP for all
TPS shipments. The REPSHIP will contain a statement requesting that the destination
acknowledge receipt of the REPSHIP and the material/shipment.
   5.10.1. Do not classify REPSHIP communications unless they contain classified
   information.
   5.10.2. REPSHIP processes:
       5.10.2.1. The destination receiving TO/approved contractor must acknowledge receipt
       of shipment within 24 hours of receipt when requested by origin. The destination
       receiving TO/approved contractor must immediately inform their security officer and
       the origin shipping TO/approved contractor if the shipment is not received by the
       REPSHIP ETA date and the responsible carrier cannot provide shipment accountability,
       acceptable explanation for delay and new ETA. Specific shipment status will be
52                                        AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


     provided and, if applicable, include proof that the shipment is under carrier's control in
     their system, an acceptable reason for the carrier's delay and their new ETA. The origin
     shipping TO/approved contractor immediately notifies their security officer and
     initiates tracer action when notified shipment is overdue at destination.
     5.10.2.2. Provide all REPSHIPs to the POE.
     5.10.2.3. All Air Force shipping/receiving activities will establish and maintain
     REPSHIP suspense lists to ensure timely receipt of material. Issue a Transportation
     Discrepancy Report (TDR) when REPSHIPs are not received prior to receipt of
     shipment or the receiving activity does not acknowledge receipt of the shipment when
     requested by the origin within 24 hours.
     5.10.2.3. (AFSPC) All Air Force shipping/receiving activities will establish and
     maintain REPSHIP suspense lists to ensure timely receipt of material. If the destination
     has not acknowledged receipt of shipment within 24 hours of delivery/2 hours for
     NWRM, then origin TO will verify with destination via telephone or e-mail that the
     property was received. If the destination is an Air Force activity, then a miscellaneous
     Transportation Discrepancy Report (TDR) can be issued for not acknowledging receipt of
     shipment within 24 hours of delivery/2 hours for NWRM shipments. A miscellaneous
     TDR can be issued to any shipping activity for not sending a REPSHIP to destination
     prior to receipt of shipment.
     5.10.2.4. Disposition for shipping and supporting documentation for all TPS and FMS
     shipments will be 10 years IAW AFRIMS, Table & Rule T24-01 R03.00.
     5.10.2.5. In addition to REPSHIPs, further NWRM shipment notifications are mandatory
     and will be ‘auditable’. Due to current system limitations, official e-mail (NIPRNET)
     notifications will be the primary means. Within 2 hours (CONUS) and 8 hours
     (OCONUS) of processing or receipt of a shipment, the TO will use official e-mail to
     notify the following recipients with shipment information including movement document
     number and TCN.
        5.10.2.5.1. Origin and destination NWRMAO organizational email account, MASO,
        depot or contractor receiving, as appropriate.
     5.10.2.6. For CONUS to CONUS SNS shipments, the TO must verify that shipment
     information is resident in DTTS-II by accessing the website’s BOL screen within 20
     minutes after releasing the shipment from the shipper system to confirm data is resident
     in DTTS-II and a REPSHIP has been transmitted. If the shipment data is not resident,
     users must go to the Add Shipment feature and manually enter shipment information.
     This will enable DTTS-II to generate the automated REPSHIP. This must be
     accomplished prior to releasing the commercial carrier for departure. Air Force activities
     are also required to confirm receipt of all CONUS to CONUS shipments that require SNS
     in DTTS II within 2 hours of shipment delivery. Shipping and receiving offices must
     contact the DTTS PMO and forward the required information if the DTTS-II website is
     inaccessible for any reason.
     5.10.2.7. All other modes of transportation such as BPA and military modes will
     continue to follow normal REPSHIP conveyance methods.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         53


5.11. Pilferable Cargo Protection. Origin and destination TOs identify those shipments
deemed to be pilferable and hold these shipments in a secure area such as a security cage while
in transportation's possession. Report any suspected pilferage to the base security force
authorities and consignor. Assist investigative personnel to include tracing the shipment from
origin to point of pilferage detection.
5.12. Movement of Classified Shipments via DOD Domestic Express Small Package Service
(DESPS) Carriers. SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL freight shipments may be moved within
CONUS and to/from Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico via an authorized carrier. Prior to using a
DESPS carrier for classified shipments, TOs must confirm the initial or continued use of a
carrier for movement of DOD classified material. Authorized carriers can be found at website
https://amclg.scott.af.mil/don/domexpress/spsindex.html. Compliance with the restrictions
and processes in the following paragraphs is mandatory to preclude any security violations
caused by improper handling of classified shipments.

       5.12.1.6. Must ensure the package wrapping, marking, and addressing are in
       compliance with directives, if packed by TO personnel, otherwise the shipper is
       responsible for the integrity of the shipment. The carrier’s package may be used as the
       outer wrapper. Classification markings, packing list, and classified document receipt will
       be located on the inner container.
       5.12.1.7. Will not ship classified to, from or between DOD contractors, unless it has been
       verified that the contractor has the required Defense Security Service approval in
       accordance with DOD5200.1-R. See DTR Part II, Chapter 205-D.2.e.
       5.12.1.8. Must ensure classified material is within the carrier’s standard size and weight

        Agency Contracting Officer's Representative (ACOR) at HQ USAF/A4RM.
5.13. Movement of Small Shipments of CAT IV ammunition and explosives via the DESPS
Carriers. The use of DESPS carriers is an additional option to existing, approved transportation
means for CAT IV, Division 1.4 ammunition and explosives shipments. Classified AA&E
shipments cannot be moved by DESPS carriers at any time. Refer to DOD 5100.76-M, Physical
Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives; DOD 5200.1-R and DTR,
Part II. Use the DESPS carrier only when it is the best value carrier with consideration to security
and accountability. These shipments are limited to small parcel shipments moving to points
within CONUS and to/from Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Shipments must meet the
DESPS carrier's eligibility rules, size and weight limits. For individual shipments exceeding

AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          55


       5.13.1.5. Attach Military Shipment Label (MSL), or I2P label, with the shipper and
       consignee's address, to the outer wrapper of the package. Address shipments to a
       specific addressee, verified in advance as having the ability to receive, process, and
       securely store the arms/ammunition. The TFG, available on the SDDC web site, is a
       source to verify consignee capabilities. A specific MSL format is not required as long as
       the minimum data and bar codes required by the DTR, Part II, are met. The DTR highly
       recommends keeping the block numbers from the DD Form 1387, Military Shipping
       Label, associated with the data content.
       5.13.1.6. To ensure delivery only to the authorized recipient, do not sign the waiver of
       delivery signature or release signature block of the commercial bill of lading.
       5.13.1.7. Verify driver's affiliation with the DESPS carrier before releasing the
       shipment. Verification includes personal recognition, photographic ID, or telephonic
       verification with the driver's local office. DO NOT disclose contents of the shipment to
       carrier personnel unless it is an unclassified, hazardous cargo shipment.
       5.13.1.8. Comply with REPSHIP requirements. See Paragraph 5.10
       5.13.1.9. Access the carrier's tracking system not more than 24 hours after required
       delivery date to verify shipments were delivered as ordered.
       5.13.1.10. Upon notification of possible in-transit loss or missed required delivery date,
       initiate immediate tracer action with the DESPS carrier and notify applicable
       MAJCOM, HQ USAF/ A4RM, SDDC safety and security hotline number, consignee,
       and supporting law enforcement and criminal investigation authorities. Where
       appropriate, initiate a security incident report. DTR, Part II, provides further guidance.
   5.13.2. Destination TO/receiving activity.
       5.13.2.1. Ensure all personnel who receive and process these shipments have appropriate
       hazardous training and meet qualifications of DOD 5100.76-M.
       5.13.2.2. Comply with Paragraph 5.13.1.10 when notified of possible in-transit loss or
       missed delivery.
       5.13.2.3. Report damage or other discrepancies in accordance with Transportation
       Discrepancy Report (TDR) instructions. See DTR, Part II.
       5.13.2.4. Protect shipments received and awaiting delivery to recipient activity as
       sensitive items under constant surveillance or in a security cage. See DTR, Part II.
5.14. Secure Holding Areas (Formerly Safe Haven, Refuge and Secure Holding
Areas). Air Force installations capable of providing holding area will do so to assure positive
security control over movement of DOD munitions and other sensitive cargo. Holding area
safety and security procedures are detailed in the DTR, Part II. For Nuclear secure holding
area requirements, refer to DOD C-5210.41-M, Air Force Supplement, Nuclear Weapon Security
Manual.
   5.14.1. TOs are responsible for ensuring their Installation Commander, in coordination with
   the other installation supporting functions, is aware of the responsibilities set forth in this
   instruction. Installation Commanders should ensure transportation, security forces, disaster
   preparedness, civil engineer, medical, munitions, environmental and safety personnel work
56                                           AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


     closely together to develop and implement their local policy in support of this DOD
     requirement. See DTR, Part II, Chapter 205 and AFI31-101.
     5.14.2. TOs will update their installation holding area capabilities through the TFG
     webpage so inbound and enroute shippers/carriers can successfully plan munitions and
     sensitive cargo movements. For procedures on when and how to update the TFG, see
     instructions in DTR, Part II. User ID and password are required to access the TFG. TOs may
     view the list of secure holding sites from the TFG web page.
     5.14.3. The TO will contact the destination activity to confirm they have the ability and
     intent to receive and secure CAT I and CAT II shipments. To prevent non-emergency in-
     transit temporary parking needs, the origin TO must schedule shipments to arrive at the
     destination within normal receiving hours, making every effort to avoid the layover of
     shipments during weekends, holidays, and non-receiving hours.
5.15. Defense Transportation Tracking System (DTTS). Air Force shippers may monitor
in transit status of their inbound and outbound AA&E and classified shipments in DTTS. To
facilitate this action they should establish both TO and worker accounts to access the DTTS
web-site. New DTTS account requests must be coordinated with AF/A4RM. DTTS will not
establish new accounts without AF/A4RM validation.
     5.15.1. Destination TO will notify DTTS of receipt for CAT I and II shipments (see
     Attachment 1) within established DTR timeframes. Shippers are able to electronically verify
     receipt, and DTTS automatically transmits a receipt verification message to the origin TO
     account.
     5.15.2. Origin shipping TO will verify the operational status of the DTTS monitoring system
     prior to loading TPS shipments. Confirm DTTS is enabled through visual examination of the
     DTTS message display. Record the status of the DTTS system check on page 1 of DD Form
     626, Item 14 A. DTTS monitoring system found to be defective must be corrected prior to
     loading. The CMOS movement document must be released immediately upon conveyance
     departure from the installation to ensure required data is residence in DTTS.
5.16. Emergency Hot Lines. Use the following SDDC and DTTS emergency hot line numbers
to obtain any type of DOD safety or security advice and assistance.
     5.16.1. Defense Transportation Tracking System (DTTS) Commercial: 800 826-0794

                                          Chapter 6

                                     BILLS OF LADING

6.1. Commercial Bill of Lading (CBL). Commercial forms and procedures, commercial
carrier electronic and manual forms, and other commercial processes and documentation are
considered CBLs. The DTR, Part II, also contains procedures for use of CBLs.
   6.1.1. Conversion of a CBL to a GBL should occur only under rare circumstances. Comply
   with guidance in DTR, Part II.
   6.1.2. For CBL shipments that do not have control identification, the TO must assign a
   control number. This number is to contain 10 alphanumeric digits. The first four positions are
   the origin TO Bill of Lading Office Code (BLOC), the fifth is the last digit of the fiscal
   year and the sixth through tenth position is the serial number. Use "00001" for the first
   shipment of the fiscal year and run consecutively through the fiscal year.
   6.1.3. A CBL register for outbound shipments is required, either automated or manual.
6.2. SF Form 1103, GBL, and SF Form 1109, GBL Continuation Sheet. Discontinuance of
GBLs for domestic freight shipments was effective 31 March 2002. However, when GBLs must
be used for international shipments, the TO will ensure adequate and complete preparation and
processing in compliance with the DTR, Part II. The DTR contains detailed information and
direction on GBL use.
   6.2.1. A GBL register for outbound shipments is required, either automated or manual.
   AF Form1335, GBL Register-Outbound, may be used.
   6.2.2. Distribution of GBLs. Also see DTR, Part II. When using ANG Transportation
   Account Code F8E0, a copy of the GBL must be provided to the ANG Readiness Center,
   Transportation Division (ANGRC/LGTT), 3500 Fetchet Ave, Andrews AFB, MD 20762.
   6.2.3. Comply with the procedures for GBL corrections or cancellations contained in DTR,
   Part II.
   6.2.4. Due to customs issues, Korea is the only country that requires a GBL. To enable
   these shipments to move on a GBL yet use TPB for payment, the following applies: On the
   GBL the statement "For Customs Purposes Only" will be shown in the Remarks Block.
   For non-PowerTrack carriers, show AFMC LSO/LOLF, Bldg 262, 4375 Chidlaw Rd,
   Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5006 in the Bill Charges To block. For PowerTrack
   carriers, in the Bill To Charges block show US Bank, 601 Second Ave, South, Minneapolis
   MN 55402. One copy of the GBL will be placed in the Packing List on the outside of the
   number 1 piece and one copy will be given to the carrier. The following procedures should be
   used in processing a “Customs Only” GBL through CMOS:
       6.2.4.1. Prepare Commercial Airway bill using CMOS or carrier system.
       6.2.4.2. Apply Third Party Billing TAC or local funds to the Commercial Airway bill.
       6.2.4.3. Prepare a GBL in CMOS. DO NOT release the GBL from CMOS. It is held in
       temporary memory long enough to print a hard copy. Note: Duplicate GBL numbers
58                                             AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


        should not be used for customs clearance into the Republic of Korea. There have been
        instances of delays because of duplicate GBL numbers.
        6.2.4.4. "For Customs Purposes Only" must be clearly stated in the GBL remarks
        section.
        6.2.4.5. After hard copies are printed, all references to the GBL should be
        erased/cleared from CMOS while the bill is still in temporary memory.
     6.2.5. Most DOD shipments to Canada are exempt from requiring an export license under
     22 CFR126.5, Canadian Exemptions. However, items on the United States Munitions List
     must be shipped using a CBL and a completed Shippers Export Declaration. Refer to DTR,
     Part V.
     6.2.6. Comply with GBL control procedures checklist. See Paragraph 6.4
6.3. Consignee Copies. A copy of the CBL/GBL must be mailed or faxed to the consignee
when electronic transmission cannot be accomplished.
6.4. SF 1103 GBL Control Procedures. All shippers will implement the following procedures
to ensure positive control over GBLs. See DTR, Part II, for additional guidance.
     6.4.1. TOs and their designated representative will be appointed in writing as the responsible
     installation GBL issuing officer and held accountable for GBL control, safekeeping and
     disposition. Other activities will designate in writing their points of contact (POC) to the TO.
        6.4.1.1. TOs will appoint, in writing, all GBL preparers, certifying proper training has
        been conducted.
        6.4.1.2. TOs are responsible for keeping the GBL appointment letter up to date at all
        times and will immediately remove individuals from the list when they are no longer
        authorized to prepare GBLs.
     6.4.2. TOs should either separate duties or provide additional oversight to GBL preparation
     and processing functions.
        6.4.2.1. Supervisors will periodically review a random number of GBLs prior to their
        issue to ensure completeness, accuracy, and monitor compliance with individual GBL
        block changes.
        6.4.2.2. TOs should ensure 100 percent review of GBLs created for classified materiel,
        hazardous cargo, and other sensitive items.
        6.4.2.3. GBLs will not be used for commercial, door-to-door, export shipments except
        where host nation customs requirements dictate.
     6.4.3. TOs will maintain records of both paper and electronic GBLs issued and the supply of
     GBLs on hand.
        6.4.3.1. Electronic records will be maintained electronically.
        6.4.3.2. A file will be kept of numbers given by SDDC.
     6.4.4. Open packages of ordered GBLs immediately upon receipt and inventory to verify
     that none are missing.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        59


  6.4.5. TOs will establish procedures for conduct of audits by personnel external to the office
  controlling SF 1103s. Audits must be conducted at least every 180 days to verify inventories
  and records.
  6.4.6. Blank, unnumbered, original GBLs or reassembled GBL sets that have been issued
  to traffic managers or their designated representatives may not be transferred.
  6.4.7. When GBLs have become unfit for use, have been issued and the planned shipment
  is subsequently canceled, or lost GBLs have been recovered, all parts of the GBL set, except
  for the original, will be destroyed. The original will be marked "canceled" or "void"
  and filed in the “property shipped” bill of lading file. Immediately notify SDDC, who in
  turn will notify all paying activities.
  6.4.8. If the original is unavailable for filing, a substitute form will be annotated with a
  signed explanation on why the GBL is missing.
  6.4.9. Lost, stolen, or otherwise unaccounted for GBLs will be immediately reported to the
  SDDC Operations Center (SDG3-GD-BP).
  6.4.10. Shippers will maintain limited numbers of either unnumbered or pre-numbered
  paper GBLs. As the unit of issue for paper GBLs is 100 per package, no office should have
  more than 100 paper GBLs on hand. Units with automated GBL producing capabilities,
  which maintain unnumbered paper GBLs, should contact SDDC/MTOP-PAS for GBL
  numbers to be used with the unnumbered paper GBLs. These GBL numbers should only be
  used during times of system failure. Do not load these numbers into your automated
  system. These numbers will be maintained on a separate GBL register and kept under lock
  and key. Pre-numbered GBL forms will be ordered from USAPPC. See DTR, Part II, Chapter
  206, for more details.
  6.4.11. The number of electronic GBL numbers ordered at any single time will be based on
  an estimated 6 months' workload.
  6.4.12. GBL controls must be reinforced through training, inspections and briefings.

                                             Chapter 7

                              AF TRANSPORTATION FUNDING

7.1. Transportation Funding Policy. This chapter provides transportation funding policy.
Current procedures are in the annual funding memorandums available on-line at the AFMC
LSO/LOL website: https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/LG/LSO/lol/. Every Air
Force MAJCOM, shipping activity and DLA/DCMA activity with first and second destination
funding requirements must ensure they are using the latest information. Additional shipping
controls may be implemented due to funding shortages. For additional Air Force transportation
funding assistance, contact AFMC LSO/LOLF, DSN787-7912, commercial (937) 257-7912,
fax      DSN      787-7860,     commercial      (937)     257-7860,       e-mail     address
AFMC/LSO.LOLF@wpafb.af.mil
7.2. Transportation Funding Procedures. Whether a MILSTRIP or non-MILSTRIP
shipment, including shipments by other military services and agencies, it is the shipment
originator’s responsibility to identify the correct funding by assignment of the appropriate
TAC or Operations and Maintenance (O&M) appropriation. TMF personnel must make every
attempt to obtain required funding information from their customers or the customer’s unit
Resource Advisor. When the shipment originator cannot provide required information, TMF
personnel will use all available resources such as TRACKER, annual FY Funding
Memorandums, or contact AFMC LSO/LOL for assistance. The TO is authorized to refuse any
shipment without proper funding information but only after all attempts to resolve funding
issues are exhausted.
     7.2.1. The TAC is a 4-position alphanumeric code that identifies the account to pay for
     movements within the DTS via AMC, MSC, and SDDC intermodal lift and port handling
     costs. The TAC also pays for movement by CBL when TPB procedures apply (see
     paragraph 12.3). The complete funding appropriation, to include Standard Document
     Number (SDN), is used on bills of lading when local funds apply. NOTE: TOs must
     forecast and budget for sufficient local O&M funds (462 EEIC) to support shipments for
     authorized base units when use of Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) or Second
     Destination Transportation/Centrally Managed Allotment (SDT/CMA) funds are not
     applicable.
     7.2.2. Funding Identification for MILSTRIP shipment. LRS Commanders will ensure
     procedures are in place to require LRS Materiel Management to validate TACs printed on
     DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document, generated by the Standard Base
     Supply System prior to delivery at TMF. LRS Materiel Management personnel have inherent
     expertise to identify shipments as item manager directed Redistribution Order (RDO) or
     lateral support through interpreting the document identifier. TMF will use AFMC current
     year funding guidance (funding memos, messages, etc.) to verify TAC assignment has been
     appropriately applied. This is especially critical during post/post operations. Use of erroneous
     TACs will result in AFMC/LSO re-imbursement off-set actions against unit funds to
     replenish the SDT CMA.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         61


   7.2.3. For non-MILSTRIP shipments, where the DD Form 1149 serves as the shipping
   document, the TO will use the customer’s funding appropriation or local O&M for
   OCONUS/CONUS movements. Refer to the Air Force Funding Memo for exceptions.
   7.2.4. The TO will refer to DTR Part II, Appendix V5, Paragraph B.3. for
   Munitions/Missile shipments.
   7.2.5. When using customer’s funding appropriation, in addition to the line of accounting
   (LOA), the customer must also provide the Standard Document Number (SDN) which
   equates to the obligating document, i.e., AF Form 406, Miscellaneous
   Obligation/Reimbursement Document (MORD), AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization, or
   DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR). For over ocean
   movement, units with an individual unit TAC must provide the TAC and corresponding
   funding appropriation on the DD Form 1149. Other TACs appropriate for over ocean
   movements are found in the funding memo (Paragraph 7.1).
   7.2.6. AEF/EAF. TOs will ensure shipment documentation, in support of Expeditionary
   Aerospace Forces (EAF)/Air and Space Expeditionary Forces (AEF) deployments,
   humanitarian support, exercises or other special projects contain, if applicable, the assigned
   JCS (9-series) or AF project code and Emergency and Special Programs (ESP) code. The
   assigned ESP code will be annotated on all movement documents that obligate funds for
   the specific program (ESP: *** (insert code). Specific ESP codes are on the SAF/FMB
   web site at http://www.saffm.hq.af.mil. Click on the FMB tab. Access to the AF Portal is
   required.
   7.2.7. Misdirected Shipments. Refer to Chapter 10, Paragraph 10.10 for procedures.
   7.2.8. Air National Guard Shipments. When assets are shipped to an ANG base (DODAAC
   F_6000-F_6599), the funding responsibility belongs to the ANG for non-WCF asset
   shipments (RDOs and returns of serviceable assets from depot repair) and lateral support
   from an active duty base. Contact the receiving ANG base for local O&M fund cite when
   moving CONUS, when moving to OCONUS ANG bases, use the ANG TAC F8E0. Lateral
   support shipments for non-WCF assets from an ANG base to an active duty base is the
   funding responsibility of the receiving base. Receiving base must provide a long line fund
   cite when moving within CONUS.
      7.2.8.1. SDT/CMA TACs will fund movement of ANG assets in support of a
      contingency, but shipment must cite the appropriate JCS 9-series project code.
      7.2.8.2. Munitions shipments directed by the ANG are not a part of the PACER AMMO
      Program and will be funded by ANG units using local O&M funds or ANG TAC as
      directed by NGB/ A4RDT. If munitions movement supports ANG activation in support
      of a contingency, SDT/CMA will fund the movement, see Para 7.2.8.1
7.3. Funding Categories.
   7.3.1. Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). DWCF is a revolving fund that combines
   previously existing commercial or business operations under a single treasury account but
   keeps prior organizational structure and command authority relationships. Revolving funds
   are financial systems that are dependent on the sale of goods and services for the cash
   necessary to finance the activities to certain DOD organizations. They do not have direct

     appropriations and operate at zero profit or loss. The AFWCF, Supply Management
     Activity Group (SMAG) is a subset of the DWCF and consists of the divisions shown in
     Table 7.1 below.

     7.3.2. Air Force Second Destination Transportation/Centrally Managed Allotment
     (SDT/CMA). SDT/CMA pays for certain movements of non-AFWCF materiel. This
     includes movements of munitions, aircraft engines, and investment items that are managed
     on an Air Force Allowance Standard. SDT/CMA funds the following:
        7.3.2.1. CONUS movement from a depot level or contractor repair facility to base.
        7.3.2.2. Over ocean by MSC or AMC.
        7.3.2.3. CONUS port handling by SDDC.
        7.3.2.4. OCONUS inter or intra-theater movement by AMC or MSC, only when more
        cost effective than ground transportation or no other alternative is available. Cost
        comparison or justification documentation must be retained by the shipper.
        7.3.2.5. CONUS inter-MAJCOM movements when IM directed.
        7.3.2.6. Commercial door-to-door (BPA/WWX) where available. Cost comparison
        must prove commercial transportation is cheaper than AMC unless cargo is MICAP/999.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                       63


  7.3.3. MAJCOM or Base Funds. These funds pay for:
     7.3.3.1. CONUS movement of non-AFWCF items moving to a repair or storage facility.
     7.3.3.2. CONUS movement of any non-AFWCF intra-MAJCOM lateral support shipment
     regardless of IM direction, including movement to an APOE/WPOE/CCP.
     7.3.3.3. CONUS movement of shipments coded as ISU, DOR, or MSI in the document
     identifier field of the DD Form 1348-1A.
     7.3.3.4. CONUS movement of any non-AFWCF shipments coded as SHP, FTR, or
     1ET in the document identifier field of the DD Form 1348-1A, including movement to
     an APOE/WPOE/ CCP.
     7.3.3.5. Overseas MAJCOM pays theater port handling of all non-AFWCF materiel.
  7.3.4. Process Exceptions for Personal Property (Household Goods, Unaccompanied
  Baggage, Privately Owned Vehicles (POV), Materiel Movement, Local Purchase and
  Purchase Card Micropurchase Shipments within the DTS. The majority of Air Force
  sponsored personal property and materiel movements within the DTS are charged to the
  funding appropriation and/or TAC cited on the TDY/ PCS order or to the TAC on the base
  supply document. Certain authorized DTS movements must be paid from the unit/base
  O&M funds requiring the establishment of a TAC. These shipments include return of excess
  household goods to non-temporary storage in the CONUS in conjunction with assignment to
  government quarters, micropurchases made through the GPC program, and materiel
  movement when normal TACs do not apply. For these shipments, the following applies:
     7.3.4.1. When shipments of personal property, materiel, local purchase, and purchase
     card shipments are entitled to move in the DTS, but are funded by unit/base O&M funds, a
     TAC chargeable to the O&M funds must be established prior to using AMC, MSC, or
     SDDC services. O&M funds used to pay for purchase card shipments expire on 30 Sep of
     each FY. Unless current FY funding is provided, TACs will be deleted from the system
     on 1 Oct. Purchase card users should be made aware that if a shipment changes mode
     from 30 Sep to 1 Oct, the previous year’s FY funds would cease on 30 Sep. Example: if
     a shipment arrives at a POE on 30 Sep but does not depart the POE until 1 Oct, the new
     FY money will have to be in-place or the shipment will be frustrated at the port until the
     new FY money is provided.
     7.3.4.2. Procedures for providing a LOA and MORD to obtain a TAC and completing
     shipping documents are located under Transportation Funding on the AFMC
     LSO/LOL website. When moving these shipments, normal DTR, Part II, clearance
     procedures apply. TP-4 deferred airfreight is also an option.

                                               Chapter 8

                                PACKAGING AND HANDLING

8.1. Uniform Procedures. Joint Service Publication AR 700-15/NAVSUPINST
4030.28D/AFJMAN 24-206/MCO 4030.33D/DLAI 4145.7, Packaging of Materiel, establishes
uniform procedures for packaging Department of Defense (DoD) materiel. Use Air Force
packaging procedures in accordance with joint directive AFJMAN 24-206, AFPD 24-2 and this
instruction.
8.2. Packaging Operations. The size and mission of an activity determines the required size
of base packaging facilities and the type, kind, and amount of equipment needed to package
materiel. Locate the packaging areas near the shipping or supply processing area.
8.3. Facilities. Each activity must have the basic facilities and equipment to package items that
are:
     8.3.1. Opened for periodic inspections.
     8.3.2. Received inadequately packaged for storage.
     8.3.3. Shipped off-base, including redistribution or return of declared excesses and return of
     reparable items to a ALC or Technology Repair Center (TRC).
8.4. Authorization of Equipment. Allowance Standard 874, part C, authorizes the cleaning,
drying, preserving, packing, and marking equipment for base-level packaging operations.
Authorization and funding for conveyer or other mechanized materiel handling equipment are
subject to AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Vol. VII, Part 1, which explains how to
request assistance in analyzing and recommending improvements in materiel handling methods
and systems installations.
8.5. Packaging Line Layout. Materiel flows from work station to work station according to the
sequence of packaging operations, regardless of the size of the operation and should include:
     8.5.1. An area for receiving, inspecting, and identifying material.
     8.5.2. An administrative and work-process planning area for reference materials, such as
     T.O.s, Special Packaging Instructions (SPIs), specifications, standards, and related logistics
     publications.
     8.5.3. A materials storage and supply area for maintaining bench stock preservative and
     packaging supplies and recycled containers (other than unit-stored reusable containers).
     8.5.4. An industrial equipment area for fabricating bags, boxes, crates, intermodal container
     blocking and bracing, printing labels and tags, and for feeding supplies (like tapes and
     adhesives) into the packaging line.
     8.5.5. A cleaning, drying, and preserving area.
     8.5.6. A unit packing area large enough to handle variable workloads.
     8.5.7. An area for containerizing and packing oversized materiel that cannot be handled in
     the unit packing area. This area must contain or be located near the woodworking machinery
     and be accessible to mechanized materiel handling equipment. Due to hazardous nature of
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        65


   munitions, the TO must ensure personnel are trained and equipped to conduct containerized
   blocking and bracing operations at alternative locations.
   8.5.8. At least one Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protective work station where trained
   personnel can package Electrostatic Discharge Sensitive (ESDS) items. This must include a
   conductive work surface and personnel grounding devices. T.O. 00-25-234, General Shop
   Practice Requirements for Repair, Maintenance, and Test of Electronic Equipment, contains
   detailed information about ESD protective work stations. Post signs prohibiting entry of
   unauthorized personnel and static-producing materials in areas designated for packaging
   ESDS items.
   8.5.9. An area for hazardous materials, if necessary, depending on the types of hazardous
   materials handled at the base.
8.6. OSHA and AFOSH Standards. Ensure that health and safety standards are consistent with
applicable Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and Air Force Occupational Safety and
Health (AFOSH) standards when planning the type and layout of facilities and equipment. See
Chapter 17 for guidelines.
8.7. Packaging Cost Control. Major commands must establish procedures to ensure that all
bases under their jurisdiction include necessary packaging requirements for all procurements.
   8.7.1. Local Purchase Items. As a rule, code items bought at base level for local purchase
   (LP). They are for immediate use. In most cases, the vendor or manufacturer standard
   packaging adequately protects these items; you may use this packaging if it meets DOT
   requirements and safety standards. Purchasing documents for LP materiel must contain the
   statement: "Military packaging is not required." The packaging provided must protect the
   item to destination and conform to applicable DOT or intrastate regulations. This statement
   permits rejection of substandard packaging at delivery based on DOT regulations.
   8.7.2. Packaging Economy. Commanders will emphasize to base personnel that protection of
   materiel enroute to the warfighters is paramount. The importance of proper packaging and
   use of economical packaging techniques can save significant Operations & Maintenance
   (O&M) funds while minimizing the creation of solid waste. Emphasize this philosophy in
   command publications and correspondence and during staff visits to the bases. Examples of
   areas where economies and improvements may be put into effect are:
       8.7.2.1. Recovery and re-use of serviceable reusable containers and packaging materials.
       8.7.2.2. Keeping specially designed packs for reshipment or return of items to the using
       or repair activity.
       8.7.2.3. Standardizing the number and types of packaging materials purchased.
       8.7.2.4. Ensuring that units use materiel for its intended purpose.
       8.7.2.5. Anticipating long term requirements for reusable containers and packaging
       materials so units can purchase them in larger, more economical quantities.
       8.7.2.6. Using the lowest acceptable levels of preservation and packing to meet the
       anticipated logistics and warfighter environment.
8.8. Preserving and Packing Items of Supply and Equipment.
66                                             AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


     8.8.1. Cleaning and Drying. Carefully clean and dry all items by any suitable process that
     does not harm the item before applying preservation techniques.
     8.8.2. Preservation. All items (serviceables, reparables, retrograde, etc.) placed in storage or
     shipped to another activity (including depot) will be preserved, as required, to prevent
     deterioration from corrosion, mildew, decay, and mold and to protect from attack by
     microorganisms, vermin, or rodent. For reparable items, preservation requirements are
     usually of a lesser degree than their serviceable counterparts because this materiel is usually
     shipped to a depot or TRC for short-term or controlled storage.
        8.8.2.1. Selecting the Method of Preservation. The type of preservation required for
        items during processing varies according to the item characteristics and types of
        exposure which may be encountered, and with the materials from which they are
        made. A SPI or T.O. prescribing a method of preserving a particular item or group of
        items takes precedence over general guidelines. When you have no specific instructions,
        use the tables in MIL-STD-2073-1 to select the method/ submethod of preservation and
        the container.
        8.8.2.2. Preservation methods for military packaging are standardized. There are five
        basic Methods of Preservation (MOP). These methods are known as Method 10 (physical
        protection), Method 20 (preservative coating only, with greaseproof wrap as required),
        Method 30 (waterproof or waterproof-greaseproof protection), Method 40
        (watervaporproof protection with preservative as required) and Method 50
        (watervaporproof protection with desiccant). Refer to MIL-STD-2073-1 for various
        specific techniques on these methods of preservation, general requirements and suggested
        methods of application. Additionally, MIL-STD-2073-1 specifies specialized military
        preservation requirements for items with specific characteristics such as ESDS
        Electromagnetic Impulse (EMI) materiel.
        8.8.2.3. Preserving Items for Shipment or Storage. When preserving items for shipment
        or storage:
            8.8.2.3.1. Use a preservative whose application, use, or removal will not damage the
            item or impair item function. For example, do not use petroleum-based preservatives
            on rubber or fabric products.
            8.8.2.3.2. Directly after cleaning and drying of the item, the preservative (where
            required) shall be uniformly applied by any appropriate procedure that permits coating
            all necessary surfaces and wrapped as required.
            8.8.2.3.3. Properly cushion, block, or brace the item in the unit container.
            8.8.2.3.4. If the item is to be exposed directly to precipitation, an over-wrap of
            appropriate conforming barrier material should be used, otherwise any other usual
            method of supplying physical protection will be sufficient.
            8.8.2.3.5. Ensure that all materials used in cleaning, drying, preserving, wrapping,
            cushioning and packing are clean and free from defects.
            8.8.2.3.6. General knowledge of the composition, characteristics, intended uses and
            methods of application of packaging materials (preservation) is found in AFPAM(I)
            24-237, Packaging of Materiel, Preservation.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                              67


8.9. Packing.
   8.9.1. DoD Levels of Packing. DoD established two levels of packing: A and B. These
   packing levels, defined in MIL-STD-2073-1 and AFJMAN 24-206, guide military
   components and their commercial industry suppliers in determining the required protection.
   Attachment 3 provides a table of common applications for the levels of packing.
       8.9.1.1. Level A. Packing protection required to meet the most severe worldwide
       shipment, handling and storage conditions. Level A packs must, in tandem with the
       applied preservative, be capable of protecting materiel from the effects of direct exposure
       to extremes of climate, transportation, terrain and operational environments.
       8.9.1.2. Level B. Packing protection required to moderate worldwide shipment,
       handling and storage conditions. Level B packs must, in tandem with the applied
       preservative, be capable of protecting materiel from the effects of indirect exposure to
       extremes of climate, transportation, terrain and operational environments.
   8.9.2. Guidance Sources for Packing. A SPI, T.O., or other document takes precedence over
   general instructions that provide detailed blocking, bracing, cushioning and packing guidance
   for a particular item or category of items. SPI requirements take precedence over T.O.s or
   other documents. If a SPI or T.O. does not provide specific guidance, use:
       8.9.2.1. MIL-STD-2073-1 to identify and select the unit and intermediate containers,
       preservation, wrap, cushioning and dunnage requirements.
       8.9.2.2. T.O. 00-85-B-3, How to Package Air Force Spares, to identify and select Fast
       Pack and Standard Pack details on packing.
   8.9.3. Primary and Alternate Packs.
       8.9.3.1. Give only one SPI number for NSNs assigned to the primary SPI.
       8.9.3.2. For long-life and short-life containers prescribed for the same item, specify
       them in the same SPI. The long-life container is the primary pack and the short-life
       container is the alternate pack.
8.10. How to Pack Items. Packaging must prevent damage or harm to items during storage,
issue or transfer. Depot reparable items shall have a SPI assigned, whether drawing, Fast Pack
or Standard Pack and SPI packed accordingly. Other non-depot reparable items, based on their
physical characteristics, can also be SPI packed. Pack single items according to the applicable
SPI or T.O., unless otherwise directed by waiver authority to deviate. SPIs offer superior
protection of expensive, mission critical materiel. When consolidating two or more line items in
a single container, place the heaviest or most dense items in the bottom. Avoid packing light,
fragile items in the same pack with heavy, rugged items. Arrange the contents of the pack to
provide the greatest protection to the interior packages. If a single line item is not assigned a SPI,
and no packaging data is available, then use the most appropriate cushioning and container to
minimally pack and protect the item.
   8.10.1. Hazardous Materials and Regulated Articles. Hazardous materials must be preserved,
   packed, and marked according to the applicable directives specified in for hazardous
   materials and hazardous waste. Unitization procedures in this document do not apply to the
   materials regulated by AFMAN 24-204(I).
68                                            AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


     8.10.2. Reparable Returns and Retrograde Shipments. All reparable returns and retrograde
     materiel shall be cleaned, dried, preserved as required, packed and marked before being
     shipped. Materiel shall be packed in their assigned SPIs or Fast Pack reusable containers,
     unless otherwise directed by the Inventory Control Point (ICP) or waiver authority to deviate.
     Authorized packaging, handling, storage & transportation (PHS&T) deviations for Fast Packs
     and Standard Packs when the correct size is unavailable for transportation priority 1 and 2
     shipments of unserviceable and serviceable items are as follows: 1) Use of the next larger
     size of Type I (Vertical Star Pack) or Type II (Folding Convoluted Pack), provided there is
     no decrease in any of the container dimensions; and 2) Use of next larger size standard pack
     containers. A complete list of Fast Pack and Standard Pack types and sizes can be found in
     T.O. 00-85B-3. The item must be wrapped sufficiently to build up the item so it fills up the
     cavity. Cushion, block, and brace each reparable item for return to depot or TRC. Units shall
     provide repairable items the prescribed packaging protection requirements to prevent damage
     or deterioration during intra-base handling and shipment to the ALC or TRC. When moving
     reparable items intra-base (on-base) or inter-base (between bases), transport them in the
     assigned container, specified SPI pack or equivalent special handling device. If the assigned
     SPI container is not available, scope the Reusable Container Worldwide Warehouse
     (RECON) system for lateral support or contact the prime ALC packaging office for
     requesting waiver authority to deviate for authorized shipments of an equivalent or suitable
     substitute container. A waiver authority number to deviate and applicable instructions will be
     provided. Additional guidance on waiver authority to deviate is found in Chapter 9.
        8.10.2.1. Use the replacement part package to repackage the reparable item for return
        shipment. If a SPI or T.O. contains packaging instructions, comply with the applicable
        document.
     8.10.3. Wood Packaging Material (WPM) Restrictions.
        8.10.3.1. The United Nations (UN) imposed restrictions for WPM to mitigate the risk of
        introducing plant pests, including pathogens, that can be harmful to agriculture and to
        natural, cultivated and urban forest resources. DoD components engaged in the
        packaging of materiel for international shipment must comply with the UN
        requirements in order for shipments to move internationally unimpeded. WPM is
        defined as wood or wood products (excluding paper products) used in supporting,
        protecting or carrying a commodity (includes dunnage). This includes, but is not
        limited to, wood pallets, skids, crates, load boards, pallet collars, wooden boxes, reels
        and dunnage.
        8.10.3.2. DOD shipments departing or returning to the United States containing WPM
        must be treated for compliance IAW International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC)
        ISPM 15. WPM must be "Kiln Dried (KD)" or "Heat Treated (HT)" to a standard core
        temperature of 56 degrees Centigrade (133 degrees Fahrenheit) for 30 minutes. It should
        be emphasized that the heat treatment standard is that the "core" of the wood reaches 56
        degrees Centigrade for 30 minutes. Compliant non-manufactured WPM is marked either
        heat-treated or KD/HT as established by American Lumber Standards Committee,
        Incorporated (ALSC) or treated (fumigated) with methyl bromide (MB) as established by
        National Wood Pallet and Container Association (NWPCA). Fumigation by MB is not
        authorized unless specifically approved by the Service or Agency Senior Acquisition
        Official and the Component WPM Program Manager.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                      69


     8.10.3.3. WPM exempt from these requirements are materials that have gone through a
     manufacturing (finished) process (i.e., corrugated fiberboard, plywood, particleboard,
     veneer, and oriented strand board (OSB)), pieces of wood less than 6mm (.024 in) in any
     dimension, and “loose wood packing materials” as defined in 7 CFR Part 319.40-1.
     Examples of loose WPM include excelsior wool (wood wool), sawdust, and wood
     shavings, produced as a result of sawing or shaving wood into small, slender and curved
     pieces. Dunnage is not always loose wood packing materials; when it is not, it must meet
     the WPM requirements.
        8.10.3.3.1. When building plywood boxes, if the plywood is nailed to solid wood
        frames or contains solid wood cleats, the boxes must also meet the WPM
        requirements.
     8.10.3.4. The WPM requirements apply to all DoD shipments worldwide.
     8.10.3.5. Any activity purchasing WPM for use in building or assembling packaging must
     comply with the following requirements for purchasing the wood. If WPM is already
     IPPC stamped, re-marking with the DoD Pest Free stamp is not required, unless the
     IPPC marks are cut off.
        8.10.3.5.1. All wooden pallets and wood containers produced of WPM shall be
        constructed from heat treated (HT to 56 degrees centigrade for 30 minutes) material
        and certified by an accredited agency recognized by the American Lumber
        Standards Committee (ALSC) in accordance with the International Plant Protection
        Convention (IPPC) ISPM 15.
        8.10.3.5.2. All WPM purchased outside of the United States must be in compliance
        with the WPM requirements. Ensure the WPM is permanently marked with the
        country’s authorized IPPC certification mark.
     8.10.3.6. All Air Force activities responsible for establishing preservation and packing
     requirements for contracts resulting in delivery of any product to the Air Force must
     ensure WPM in new contracts include the requirements outlined above. Additionally, all
     existing contracts (including contracts administered by DCMA) and delivery orders that
     result in deliveries to the DoD must be modified to reflect the requirements above.
     8.10.3.7. KD/HT or HT lumber; or KD/HT or HT WPM must be stored separately
     from any non-KD/HT or HT lumber; or non-KD/HT or HT WPM. A minimum
     segregation of four feet is recommended in storage and warehouse conditions to avoid
     intermingling of stock.
     8.10.3.8. Air Force activities shall keep documentation identifying all lumber or WPM
     procured meets the above KD/HT or HT requirement. WPM records retention at each
     certified site shall be for a period of not less than two years. This information will be
     required for audit purposes. As a minimum, these records will identify:
        8.10.3.8.1. Purchase Order/Requisition/Receipt and Quantity of KD/HT or HT
        lumber or KD/ HT or HT WPM purchased.
        8.10.3.8.2. Work order(s) or other documentation that identifies amount of board
        feet (ft) used.

        8.10.3.8.3. Procedures for the control of the IPPC and DoD certification stamps.
        Certification stamps must be secured to ensure only certified personnel use them.
        8.10.3.8.4. Training certifications for any person authorized to use the IPPC and
        DoD certification stamps.
     8.10.3.9. Existing or previously packaged material can be tested, inspected and certified
     as pest free by DoD shipping activities if the WPM meets one of the following
     requirements:
        8.10.3.9.1. If the pack date is less than five years and is not packaged in compliant
        WPM, it will be inspected to ensure the WPM is bark free, contains no bore holes
        larger than 3mm, and the moisture content is less than 20 percent.
        8.10.3.9.2. If the pack date is five years or older (that can be verified/validated), it
        will be inspected ensuring the WPM is bark free, contains no bore holes larger than
        3mm, and is not infested by pests. Moisture content test is not required.
        8.10.3.9.3. When the WPM is inspected as authorized in paragraphs 8.10.3.9.1 and
        8.10.3.9.2 above and found compliant, the WPM will be permanently marked as pest
        free with the DoD pest free mark. The IPPC international mark may not be used for
        this inspection and certification process.
     8.10.3.10. When the WPM is inspected and certified as authorized in paragraphs
     8.10.3.9.1 and 8.10.3.9.2 above, the following information for each shipment must be
     maintained:
        8.10.3.10.1. NSN
        8.10.3.10.2. Quantity
        8.10.3.10.3. TCN
        8.10.3.10.4. Tested Moisture Percentage
     8.10.3.11. Visual inspection of the wood must confirm the WPM contains no bore or
     grub holes larger than 3mm and no presence of visible bark.
     8.10.3.12. Previously packaged material that fails any of the requirements above must be
     repackaged using HT compliant WPM.
     8.10.3.13. Any new container/pallet must be constructed/repaired with only KD/HT or
     HT wood that meets the requirements above.
     8.10.3.14. WPM Markings.
        8.10.3.14.1. The DOD Pest Free mark is accepted by USDA APHIS and US Customs
        and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security for imports
        into CONUS of retrograde materiel packaged in/on WPM. The DOD Pest Free mark
        is to be used for non-compliant ISPM 15 imports back into CONUS. Temporary and
        emergency situations may warrant this certification mark process. The DOD Pest
        Free process is to be used: for any WPM shipments when there are no established
        host nation ISPM 15 programs (non-signatory ISPM 15 country), using visual
        inspection and moisture test standards as applicable; when there are austere
        conditions; when the deploying force will occupy the location for a limited time (less
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          71


          than 180 days); when the WPM brought with the deploying force will be returning
          directly to CONUS; or when importing back into CONUS existing WPM stored at an
          OCONUS location with a valid date of pack earlier than 31 Dec 07. Existing or
          previously packaged materiel that passes the visual inspection and moisture test as
          applicable will be permanently marked (stenciled, branded or stamped) in a visible
          location, preferably on at least two opposite sides of the article, with the DoD Pest
          Free mark. Use the activity DODAAC where required as identified in Figure 8.1

Figure 8.1. DoD Pest Free Mark.




          8.10.3.14.2. WPM (pallets, containers, reels, boxes, crates, etc.) assembled/built at an
          Air Force (including AFRC and ANG) installation utilizing KD/HT or HT compliant
          lumber will be permanently marked (stenciled, branded or stamped) with the ISPM
          15 mark. Unit loads of multiple containers may be marked using marking boards and
          placed on two opposite sides of the load. Wooden pallets will be marked on two
          stringers, opposite sides. DoD Components that are self-certified or ALSC accredited
          are authorized to use the ISPM 15 certification mark on all WPM that fully complies
          with ISPM 15 guidelines. Non-compliant WPM will not be used for shipments in
          which materiel has an ISPM signatory country as the final destination. The ISPM 15
          certification marking (see Figure 8.2) shall display the letters “US” in bold (d), the
          packaging activity’s Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC) (b),
          and either “HT” denoting heat treated WPM or “MB” denoting WPM “fumigated”
          with Methyl Bromide as noted in the Figure C2.F1. by “HT” (c). The marking
          “TRADEMARK” (a) represents the logo of the U.S. services that can be displayed
          under the DODAAC. The marking “DUNNAGE” (f) is used strictly for dunnage,
          otherwise it is left blank. Item (e) is the approved International symbol for compliant
          wood packaging material.

Figure 8.2. ISPM 15 Certification Mark.




          8.10.3.14.3. WPM certification marks to be procured by activities are: 1) A DOD
          Pest Free stamp; 2) AN ISPM 15 certification stamp; and 3) an ISPM 15 certification
          mark applicable to dunnage. Activities must have these stamps on-hand. Marking

        stamps must be permanent, waterproof, use petroleum resistant inks and must
        maintain sufficient durability during exposure to field conditions. Marking shall be
        IAW MIL-STD-129.
     8.10.3.15. Management Controls. Air Force activities shall report, audit and enforce
     WPM standards and measures. Each Air Force activity shall register their DODAAC and
     WPM Site Custodian(s) via the DoD WPM System Toolset at:
     https://www.icptarp.net/wpm/wpm_training.nsf/. Installations that have two or more
     packaging mission support activities, identified by separate DODAACs, shall have
     separate WPM programs in terms of custodial management controls. Accordingly, each
     activity shall register their DODAAC and WPM site custodians via the DOD WPM
     System Toolset, maintain separate WPM certification marks with the packaging activity’s
     DODAAC and execute custodial management controls and reporting requirements. Each
     activity shall provide monthly reports as indicated below to the DOD WPM Management
     Toolset within two weeks (14 days) of the reported month. WPM audits shall be
     accomplished by the host Wing. Each Air Force activity shall also provide the name,
     DODAAC, phone number (DSN and Commercial) and address of their WPM Site
     Auditor(s) to their respective MAJCOM. The MAJCOM WPM Program Manager point
     of contact will consolidate and provide this listing to the WPM Component Manager. Air
     Force activities are advised to direct WPM system access requests, password resets and
     reporting concerns to their appropriate MAJCOM WPM Program Manager point of
     contact.
        8.10.3.15.1. WPM Site Custodian(s) Reporting. Air Force activities shall provide
        two mandatory monthly reports to the DoD WPM System Toolset: 1) Lumber usage
        monthly report; and 2) DOD Pest Free monthly report. The reports must be posted to
        the DoD WPM System within two weeks (14 days) of the reported month. If the
        DOD Pest Free stamp is not utilized, custodians will zero-out the numbers on the
        applicable DOD Pest Free monthly report. The following reporting requirements are
        required:
            8.10.3.15.1.1. Activities using the DoD Pest Free certification will maintain
            records of certified materiel by documenting the following information:
               8.10.3.15.1.1.1. Requisition number, item NSN, moisture reading, visually
               inspected for boreholes over 3mm in diameter (Yes/No), quantity of WPM
               marked, inspector’s signature verifying WPM meets DoD requirements and
               WPM is properly marked, and the date of certification.
            8.10.3.15.1.2. Activities fabricating new WPM or repairing WPM with new
            lumber and applying the IPPC certification mark will track the following:
               8.10.3.15.1.2.1. Lumber receipts including the receipt or requisition
               number, mill code, lumber NSN or identification number, lumber thickness,
               lumber width, lumber length, quantity received and date of receipt.
               8.10.3.15.1.2.2. Lumber used including the cut and fabrication work order,
               lumber NSN or identification number, lumber thickness, lumber width,
               lumber length, quantity received and date of fabrication.
               8.10.3.15.1.2.3. A lumber usage report will be prepared identifying the
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         73


              lumber on hand at the beginning of the month, lumber received, lumber used,
              and final inventory of lumber on hand at the end of the month.
       8.10.3.15.2. WPM Site Audit Inspections. Appointed and certified WPM Site
       Auditors shall perform annual on-site audits. WPM Site Auditors shall not be
       assigned to the Deployment and Distribution Flight. The WPM Audit Inspection
       Checklist is found in Appendix 4. WPM Site Auditors will verify the site
       documentation records contained in Appendix 4 are accurate and on file in the
       packaging and preservation office and/or cargo movement element of the TMF.
       Audit results shall be posted to the WPM Management Toolset in the DOD WPM
       system within two weeks of the reported month as specified in the reporting
       frequency requirement in paragraph 8.10.3.15.2.1 Each MAJCOM will consolidate
       all their bases WPM audit reports and forward their MAJCOM consolidated report to
       401 SCMS/GUMA (AFGLSC) for evaluation. Audit reports will be accomplished
       using the procedures found under the DOD WPM System Toolset. Any discrepancies
       noted during audits will be reported immediately to the squadron commander.
          8.10.3.15.2.1. WPM audit results shall be posted to the WPM system toolset
          within two weeks (14 days) of the reported month. Installations that have
          completed three consecutive compliant monthly WPM audits on time will be
          progressing to quarterly audits. Installations that have completed two consecutive
          compliant quarterly WPM audits will be progressing to semi-annual audits.
          Following are the schedules for quarterly and semi-annual audits:

           December                                                       NLT 14 January
       8.10.3.15.3. Consequences of Audit Failure/Non-Compliance.
          8.10.3.15.3.1. All commercial and Air Force activities responsible for repairing
          or fabricating WPM resulting in Air Force transnational cargo movement to
          American Lumber Standards Committee (ALSC)/National Wood Pallet
          and Container Association (NWPCA) requirements shall receive warnings,
          suspensions and withdrawal of ALSC stamp marking privileges for non-
          compliance as specified in ALSC/NWPCA enforcement regulations.
          8.10.3.15.3.2. At DoD site-certified WPM activities, the following procedures
          apply to audit failures or reported non-compliance:
              8.10.3.15.3.2.1. First Audit Failure/Reported Non-Compliance. The WPM
              site custodian, after notification of the first audit failure/non-compliance, shall
              provide within 15 days written analysis of the problem and proposed
              resolution to the responsible WPM Site Auditor and to the MAJCOM WPM
74                                            AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


                   Program Manager and the Air Force WPM Component Manager. The site
                   shall be re-audited within 30 days to ensure process improvements have been
                   implemented and are sufficient to resolve the discrepancy.
                   8.10.3.15.3.2.2. Second Audit Failure/Reported Non-Compliance. A second
                   audit failure/non-compliance within the 30 days requires further involvement:
                     8.10.3.15.3.2.2.1. Provide within 15 days written analysis of the problem
                     and proposed resolution to the MAJCOM WPM Program Manager and the
                     Air Force WPM Component Manager.
                     8.10.3.15.3.2.2.2. The MAJCOM WPM Program Manager or Air Force
                     WPM Component Manager shall re-audit the site within 60 days to ensure
                     process improvements have been implemented to resolve the discrepancy.
                     8.10.3.15.3.2.2.3. Third Audit Failure/Reported Non-Compliance. A third
                     audit failure/non-compliance within the 60 days requires greater
                     involvement:
                     8.10.3.15.3.2.2.3.1. If the failure/non-compliance results from WPM
                     documentation (records) maintenance or to contract for the delivery of the
                     proper WPM, the DoD site certification shall be withdrawn. The facility
                     shall contact ALSC to perform monthly commercial inspections, contract
                     with a local ALSC operation, or ship materiel to another DoD self-certified
                     site. All costs associated with actions resulting from a third failure shall be
                     the responsibility of the facility.
                     8.10.3.15.3.2.2.3.2. If the failure/non-compliance is related to the shipment
                     of defective packaging, the installation/shipper shall be responsible for
                     repackaging costs (and associated demurrage). All installation personnel
                     shall have their DoD site certifications removed and shall be required to
                     successfully re-accomplish the online WPM certification training prior to
                     reauthorization to apply the certification marks.
                     8.10.3.15.3.2.2.3.3. The site may reapply for DoD site certification after
                     one (1) year. All wood packing and fabrication personnel shall be required
                     to successfully re-accomplish the online WPM certification training for
                     site wood packaging re-certification.
        8.10.3.16. WPM Training Requirements. Personnel involved in audit inspections,
        remediation and marking of WPM must successfully complete the DoD Self-
        Certification qualification training (initial) and refresher training every two years. DoD
        Self-Certification training will be accomplished via DoD WPM System at:
        https://www.icptarp.net/wpm/wpm_training.nsf/. Additional information on the DoD
        certification training information is available by contacting (717) 605-2784. Only
        personnel who have successfully completed the above training may apply the above
        certification markings. Successfully completed training shall be documented and
        maintained in the employees training records.
     8.10.4. Security Assistance such as Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Military Assistance
     Program (MAP). Security Assistance items, including FMS, are especially susceptible
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           75


  to damage due to unknown and unfavorable transportation, climatic, and storage
  conditions. Provide military packing protection (Level A) when outdoor storage conditions
  are anticipated and military packing protection (Level B) when indoor storage conditions are
  anticipated, unless otherwise directed by the procuring country.
  8.10.5. Parcel Post Shipments. Envelopes and tapes used to seal packages must be capable of
  absorbing a postmark.
  8.10.6. Electrostatic Discharge Sensitive (ESDS) Items. Weapon systems are controlled by
  increasingly complex microcircuits composed of components that require ESD protection to
  prevent damage caused by transient electrical overstress. Never handle ESDS items,
  regardless of condition, without their protective packaging except at a grounded ESD
  workstation. T.O. 00-25-234, Section VII, Electrostatic Discharge Control, provides specific
  guidelines for protecting electrical and electronic parts, assemblies, and equipment. It also
  contains guidance on ESD protective workstations. SPIs specify packaging requirements for
  ESD depot reparables.
     8.10.6.1. For "Black Box" items, follow the guidance outlined in T.O. 00-25-234.
     Connectors or plugs (power or data transfer) must be covered with conductive
     caps/plugs for any ESDS end item. The metal chassis or frame acts as a Faraday cage or
     electrostatic shield. Conductive caps or plugs shall be used to complete the Faraday
     cage. Without proper conductive caps or plugs, the connectors serve as an induction
     (pathway) in which ESD pulses can travel. T.O. 00-25-234, Table 7-3, lists various cap or
     plug sizes, conductive materials and substitutes.
     8.10.6.2. ESD items shall be properly packaged in ESD protective packaging while not
     in a protected area to prevent damage during intrabase handling and return to depot or
     TRC.
     8.10.6.3. ESD items shall be properly packaged and handled by personnel knowledgeable
     in ESD precautionary procedures.
     8.10.6.4. Use care in opening ESD items. ESD bags are usually constructed with
     enough extra material to allow for at least one additional heat seal, thereby facilitating re-
     use in the maintenance activity.
     8.10.6.5. Identify ESD items by Type Cargo Code “3” on DD Form 1348-1A and by
     special interior and exterior markings. These markings may include the yellow
     sensitive-electronic-device caution label or symbol. You do not need to repackage ESD
     items packaged before 1 November 1983.
  8.10.7. Industrial Plant Equipment (IPE).
     8.10.7.1. All IPE shall be cleaned, dried, preserved and packaged in accordance with
     MIL-STD-107J, Preparation and Handling of Industrial Plant Equipment (IPE) for
     Shipment and Storage. Guidance for equipment disassembly, cleaning, weatherproofing,
     skidding, preservation, packing protection and approved methods for preparing
     Government-owned IPE for shipment and storage are outlined therein.
     8.10.7.2. Use MIL-STD-107J in conjunction with MIL-HDBK-701, Blocking, Bracing
     and Skidding of Industrial Plant Equipment for Shipment and Storage. The use of DOD
     reusable skids in accordance with MIL-STD-701 is a cost savings effort by the
76                                             AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


        Government. Direct any proposed deviation from the use of DOD reusable skids for
        equipment weighing 42,000 pounds or less to the Defense Supply Center Richmond,
        ATTN: DSCR-VBD, 8000 Jefferson Davis Highway, Richmond, VA. 23297-5610.
     8.10.8. Protecting Metallurgical Failure Exhibits. DD Form 2332, Product Quality
     Deficiency Report Exhibit, must accompany such exhibits. Do not let the packaging and
     handling prevent accurate metallurgical failure analysis. These rules apply:
        8.10.8.1. Do not clean or apply acid to the fracture except for exhibits shipped from
        overseas. Clean exhibits from overseas activities only when necessary to satisfy public
        health requirements. Take care to prevent damage to evidence during cleaning. Foreign
        products on the fracture may aid analysis.
        8.10.8.2. Do not touch the fracture face with fingers, tools, or instruments.
        8.10.8.3. Protect the fracture face from the environment, particularly where corrosion
        can occur. Do not apply preservatives to the fracture face; they could interfere with
        analysis.
        8.10.8.4. Store them in a desiccated, watervaporproof bag, fabricated from MIL-PRF-
        131 barrier material or equivalent. Seal the bag airtight. Include only one item per
        watervaporproof bag.
        8.10.8.5. If the exhibit is shipped intact rather than in parts, ship only the exhibit item in
        the container.
        8.10.8.6. If the item is bent or broken, use a shipping container large enough to prevent
        rearranging or disturbing the bent or broken area.
        8.10.8.7. Pack items to prevent damage to the exhibit evidence during shipment. If you
        pack more than one exhibit in a single container, be sure to use cushioning or wrap
        to prevent contact between each exhibit. NOTE: T.O. 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency
        Reporting and Investigating System, contains further guidance on protecting
        metallurgical failure exhibits and marking exhibits for material deficiency reports.
     8.10.9. War Reserve Materiel (WRM), Readiness Spares Package (RSP) and On-Board
     Spares (OBS):
        8.10.9.1. Give WRM level A or B packing accordingly (see Attachment 3), unless
        otherwise specified by the IM or ALC packaging office.
        8.10.9.2. These requirements, or those specified by the IM or ALC packaging office,
        apply even when the packaging and/or maintenance activities packs the items for
        deployment or mobility within kits or mobility bins (e.g. Cadillac bins). Internal packing
        of assets in SPI reusable containers must remain intact. Specifically, do not remove the
        assets from their prescribed SPI reusable containers. Stuffing assets in mobility bins
        without their SPI reusable containers (with only bubble-wrap cushioning) is a major
        contributing factor in subjecting these assets to damage from adverse shock and
        vibration. Bubble-wrap is authorized only for use as additional cushioning to fill void
        spaces inside the mobility bins.
        8.10.9.3. Keep serviceable and/or depot reparable WRM, RSP, OBS or other critical
        spare assets in their prescribed SPI/Fast Packs to ensure protection during
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                       77


     deployment/mobility and to provide packs for retrograde reparables from forward
     deployed locations. The prime ALC packaging office can assist with proposed
     reconfigured SPI pack inserts to accommodate OBS due to on-board aircraft space
     constraints.
     8.10.9.4. Generally you do not stock packaging materials as WRM, unless otherwise
     directed by Unit Type Codes (UTCs). However, ensure that spare reusable containers are
     available at forward deployed locations during follow-on RSP for retrograde Not
     Mission Capable Supply (NMCS)/ MICAP mission support to the ALC or TRC.
     8.10.9.5. OCONUS bases may maintain up to a 60-day level of bench stock of packaging
     materials, based on current usage.
     8.10.9.6. CONUS bases must maintain at least a 30-day supply.
     8.10.9.7. The MAJCOM may approve storage of additional materials at the base or
     within the region.
  8.10.10. Uncrated Shipments. Crate most items to facilitate handling and item protection. A
  qualified carrier certified to transport uncrated items may ship those uncrated large items
  that require special handling. Obtain lists of qualified carriers from Surface Deployment
  and Distribution Command (SDDC) area offices. You may load packaged items in a vehicle
  partly filled with uncrated items.
     8.10.10.1. Criteria for Large Items. Activities may ship large items, unless otherwise
     specified by an SPI or palletized unit load marking drawings, uncrated if all of these
     criteria apply:
         8.10.10.1.1. The cost of packaging and shipping by other means would cost more
         than shipping the item uncrated.
         8.10.10.1.2. The item is capable of withstanding shipment uncrated. Parts that are
         highly susceptible to damage must be removed from the major component and
         packaged properly. Then firmly attach these parts to the unit being shipped before
         releasing it to the carrier.
         8.10.10.1.3. Qualified carriers are available to handle the shipment.
         8.10.10.1.4. The item does not have a security classification that requires packing or
         crating to prevent disclosure to unauthorized personnel.
         8.10.10.1.5. The item is not hazardous cargo as classified by AFMAN 24-204(I), the
         Department of Transportation (DOT) or other Federal regulatory policy.
         8.10.10.1.6. SDDC approves and authorizes the shipment as required by DOD
         4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation.
  8.10.11. Handling.
     8.10.11.1. Opening and Unpacking. To optimize re-use, carefully open and unpack
     materiel to prevent damage to fiberboard containers and their components. Do not strip
     old tapes and labels from fiberboard containers; it can delaminate (peel the protective
     layers off) the container and reduce the serviceable life. Prevent obliteration of
     stenciled information (e.g. SPI number, NSN, dimensions, etc.) located on most
78                                            AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


        containers. Carefully cut open the flaps by shallowly cutting along the tape line. Cut off
        loose ends of existing tape. Carefully remove all protruding nails, staples, metal
        strapping, and other sharp metal objects. Put all container components inside, or attach
        them to, the container so they do not get lost. Tape over the original tapes and place the
        new label over the old.
        8.10.11.2. Closure, Reinforcement and Sealing. Closure, sealing and reinforcement for
        shipment and storage will be accomplished as required and specified by ASTM D5118
        and PPP-B-1672, depending on the container type, levels of protection and preservation
        methods. The tape used for reinforcement and sealing shall be of the specification, type
        and size specified for each category and type of box. Adhesives will not be used to close
        Fast Packs or standard packs. Do not use staples or glue to make the final closure of Fast
        Packs and standard packs. Surfaces to which tape for closure is to be applied must be free
        of loose soil, oil, or grease. These surfaces should be wiped clean prior to application of
        tape. Guidelines are also specified in T.O. 00-85B-3.
     8.10.12. Marking and Labeling.
        8.10.12.1. MIL-STD-129, Marking for Shipment and Storage. This document
        establishes procedures for marking military supplies and equipment for shipment and
        storage. Specifications, T.O.s, drawings, and SPIs may also contain special marking
        requirements. In all cases except those described in this section, you must comply with
        MIL-STD 129.
        8.10.12.2. Multipack Shipments. Mark all consolidated shipping containers "Multipack."
        Include level of packing, date of pack, and gross weight and cubic measurements
        instead of content and identification markings. MIL-STD-129 contains marking
        requirements for multipack shipments including those containing shelf-life or warranty
        items. Multipacks containing properly packaged ESD sensitive items do not require ESD
        markings on the exterior multipack container. If a consolidation container contains a unit
        container marked "FRAGILE," do not put "FRAGILE" labels on the consolidation
        container unless the gross weight of the consolidation container is 75 pounds (33.75
        kg) or less.
        8.10.12.3. Expedite Shipment Marking. The Air Force uses two codes to identify
        expedite shipments: Code 999 and NMCS (formerly MICAP). Code 999 shipments
        take precedence over all other shipments. While both codes can apply to a single
        shipment, do not apply NMCS markings if you use 999 markings. Mark each unit in the
        shipment.
        8.10.12.4. Expedite Labels. Shipping documents are annotated if the shipments are a
        Mission Capable (MICAP) 999 or NMCS. The 999 shipments are identified by either
        the Optional Form 80, 2.0" x 2.0" (50.80mm x 50.80mm), or Optional Form 81,
        4.0" x 4.0" (101.60mm x 101.60mm), NSN 7540-00-139-4832. Except when 999
        markings apply, the NMCS markings are identified by either the Optional Form 83, 3.0"
        x 1.5" (76.20mm x 38.10mm), or Optional Form 84, 3.0" x 5.0" (76.20mm x
        127.00mm), NSN 7540-00-139-4832. GSA is a source for procuring these forms. Use the
        largest size that space permits. Attach one label on the identification side next to the
        address label. Place another label on the opposite side of the container. Mark
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                       79


     irregularly shaped units where shippers can easily see the markings. Apply as indicated
     in this paragraph for 999 shipments.
  8.10.13. Project Code Markings. Shipping documents tell you if the item has a project code.
  Annotate the applicable project code number in the space provided for it on the MSL IAW
  MIL-STD-129 and AFMAN 23-110. When a project code is assigned or is specified in a
  solicitation or contract, project code labels shall be applied to exterior containers. The
  project code shall appear in the address and also on a white label having a disc of a highly
  contrasting color superimposed on it. Specific guidance on applied project code markings is
  found in MIL-STD-129, Paragraph 5.2.2.
  8.10.14. Fragile Markings. When packaging conforms to specified Air Force packaging
  requirements, you do not need "fragile" markings unless prescribed by a SPI. When
  packaging does not completely conform to Air Force Requirements for a specific item, the
  shipper must decide whether to use "fragile" markings.
  8.10.15. Marking and Identifying Reusable Containers.
     8.10.15.1. Mark the exterior of SPI packs and reusable contractor packs with
     "REUSABLE PACK" (except for Fast Packs, standard packs, and long-life FSC 8140
     and 8145 containers).
     8.10.15.2. Mark the Fast Pack containers only with the words "FAST PACK" and the
     Fast Pack code, not with the complete Fast Pack SPI number. The Fast Pack code
     consists of the last three digits of the Fast Pack SPI number, beginning with an "X" (e.g.
     XE6). See PPP-B-1672 for additional Fast Pack marking guidance.
     8.10.15.3. Standard packs do not need to be marked with "REUSABLE PACK" or with
     the standard pack SPI number.
     8.10.15.4. Ensure that ALC and base logistics systems print the SPI number on the
     DD Form 1348-1A, which provides a convenient record for identifying the item to the
     SPI and for ensuring the accuracy of the SPI number on the shipping container.
  8.10.16. Marking Component Parts of SPI Containers.
     8.10.16.1. If local units fabricate SPI packs, mark the SPI number on the exterior of the
     container before shipment.
     8.10.16.2. Keep together and mark with the SPI number the internal component parts of
     SPI containers that have complex configurations (like die-cuts or special purpose inserts)
     in the container.
     8.10.16.3. Do not obliterate Performance Oriented Packaging (POP) markings from the
     Fast Pack containers.
     8.10.16.4. Do not mark SPI numbers on classified shipments, Fast Packs and standard
     packs.
  8.10.17. Marking Commercially Purchased Materiel Using the Government Purchase Card
  (GPC).

        8.10.17.1. All shipments going overseas (particularly into contingency areas), via
        aerial/water ports and DLA Containerization and Consolidation Points (CCP), must be
        packaged appropriately for overseas shipment and marked IAW MIL-STD-129.
            8.10.17.1.1. Shipments must be clearly marked with the Ship To address (CCP
            address) and the Mark For address (the actual address of the OCONUS customer).
            Shipments must also have the Transportation Control Number (TCN), Required
            Delivery Date (RDD), Project (if any) and Transportation Priority (TP) clearly
            marked on the shipment.
        8.10.17.2. GPC holders are directed to contact their local TMF for assistance.
     8.10.18. Orientation Markings.
        8.10.18.1. This End Up - Orientation Arrows . When a shipper must carry a package of
        restricted articles in an upright position and you must mark it to that effect, use
        Dangerous Goods Packaging “This End Up” Orientation Arrows (Figure 8.3), to show
        how the package should be stowed. The label arrows must point up to indicate the top of
        the package.

Figure 8.3. This End Up - Orientation Arrows.




        8.10.18.2. Marking Top-heavy Shipments.
            8.10.18.2.1. To determine when containers or crates require top-heavy marking (in
            addition to the center of balance requirements of MIL-STD-129):
            8.10.18.2.2. Locate the center of gravity (CG) of a uniformly distributed load. To
            determine the CG, locate the side with the smallest base dimension of either the
            width (w) or the length (l) of the crate (Figure 8.4 and Figure 8.5). When the base
            dimensions of either "w" or "l" are equal (Figure 8.4), either side will work. On the
            chosen side, draw diagonal lines from opposite corners. The intersection of the
            diagonal lines is the CG of the crate.
            8.10.18.2.3. Using the same base dimension used to find the CG, draw an equilateral
            triangle on the crate (Figure 8.4 and Figure 8.5). If the CG is within the triangle
            (Figure 8.2), the container is within the safe limits for normal handling. If the CG
            is not within the triangle (Figure 8.5), the crate is unsafe for normal handling and
            should be marked "TOPHEAVY."
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                       81


Figure 8.4. Uniform Load.




Figure 8.5. Topheavy Load.




   8.10.19. Forklift Entry. You must use a captive forklift entry on crates that are unsafe for
   normal handling even when they are marked "TOPHEAVY."
      8.10.19.1. For loads you suspect might have a normally high CG (machinery, drill
      presses, bandsaws, wing sections), determine the CG as follows:
82                                            AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


        8.10.19.2. Turn the crate on its side and place it over a pipe. Roll the crate back and forth
        until you can balance it.
        8.10.19.3. After you find the CG, mark the crate as "TOPHEAVY." NOTE: If the height
        of the crate is equal to three times the base, you must mark the crate "TOPHEAVY."
     8.10.20. Unitization of Cargo. Unitization is the grouping of like or unlike items for
     shipment, kept together as a unit, until they are received by the user. Pack Air Force cargo
     into units (unitize) at the source of shipment when practical. Unitizing materiel provides
     greater efficiency and economy in handling, transporting and documenting cargo by
     reducing the number of containers that must be individually handled. Properly unitized loads
     reduce the incidents of damage, loss and pilferage. The unitization policies in this section do
     not apply to hazardous materials regulated by AFMAN 24-204(I). Unitization is practiced
     by two basic methods: palletization and consolidation.
        8.10.20.1. Palletized Loads. Unless otherwise specified, palletize materiel when:
            8.10.20.1.1. Containers do not require skids.
            8.10.20.1.2. Quantities to a destination exceed either a total of 250 pounds (112
            kilograms (kg)) excluding the pallet, or a volume of 20 cubic feet (6 cubic meters).
            8.10.20.1.3. Container size permits use of one of the pallet patterns of MIL-HDBK-
            774, Palletized Unit Loads.
            8.10.20.1.4. Special instructions for specific commodities take precedence over
            MIL-HDBK-774.
            8.10.20.1.5. Do not exceed the weight and dimensional limits of MIL-HDBK-774 on
            palletized loads.
            8.10.20.1.6. Use the 40 by 48-inch (101.6 by 121.9 millimeter (mm)) pallet with a
            four-way forklift entry for ease of loading and in support of NATO forces.
            8.10.20.1.7. Keep the height of the vertical center of balance as close as possible to
            one-half the length of the pallet to obtain maximum use of the pallet with maximum
            stability for safe handling.
            8.10.20.1.8. For loading 463L pallets, refer to AMCI 24-101, Vol. 11. Technical
            aspects of 463L pallets are referenced in T.O. 35D33-2-2-2, Instructions with Parts
            Breakdown, 463L Air Cargo Pallets, Types HCU-12/E (Brownline Corporation).
        8.10.20.2. Consolidation. Consolidation is accomplished by placing the unit packages
        into a larger container. Consolidation containers may be constructed of fiberboard, paper
        overlaid veneer, plywood, or lumber. They may be demountable or nondemountable and
        are usually secured to a pallet or to a skidded base. Some consolidation containers are
        designed to be compatible with 463L System, while others may be used as inserts in
        transporters such as CONEX, MILVANS, or SEAVANS, or to be used as a separate
        shipping container. When practical and consistent with DOD Regulation 4500.9-R,
        consolidate containers for a single consignee overseas or, when advantageous, to several
        consignees within the CONUS. The consolidation container must adequately protect
        contents during shipment. Do not use consolidation in lieu of unit packaging. To obtain
        maximum advantages of consolidation:
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        83


         8.10.20.2.1. Restrict total weight and the cubic measurements of the contents so
         they do not exceed the limits prescribed for the selected container.
         8.10.20.2.2. Assemble loose items or small unit packs of the same stock number into
         a single unit by bagging, bundling, tying, wrapping, or putting them into a carton, and
         identifying and marking the contents according to MIL-STD-129 before placing them
         in the container.
         8.10.20.2.3. Facilitate mechanical handling by placing skids on containers that have
         a gross weight greater than 250 pounds (90 kg), or greater than 100 pounds (45.40
         kg) if the dimensions exceed 48" x 20" (121.92 cm x 50.80 cm). Use a pallet base on
         consolidation containers that have a gross weight greater than 250 pounds (112.50
         kg) or a gross cube greater than 20 cubic feet (6 cubic meters).
         8.10.20.2.4. For Tri-walls and other bulk shipments, there should be a skid
         attached with banding. Banding should be such that a forklift is able to get under and
         pick up from all sides of the container.
         8.10.20.2.5. Pack serviceable and unserviceable materiel separately.
  8.10.21. Preservation and Levels of Packing for Unitized Loads.
     8.10.21.1. Levels of Packing for Palletized Units Loads. You must sheath palletized
     unit loads containing Level B or commercial packs for delivery overseas. Supplement the
     fiberboard sheathing with a waterproof barrier unless known favorable storage and
     handling conditions en route to the final destination indicate you do not need to. Do not
     sheath palletized unit loads containing Level A packs destined for overseas solely for
     packaging protection. Loads destined for CONUS installations do not require sheathing
     (unless shipping tire/wheel assemblies) regardless of packing level.
  8.10.22. Preservation and Levels of Packing for Containerized Unit Loads. After considering
  the total logistics pipeline, preservation and levels of packing may be reduced when exterior
  container dimensions permit shipment in CONEXS, SEAVANS or MILVANS. If container
  service can not be used, then allow the shipper at origin or the military ocean terminals to
  overpack exterior containers. If breakbulk and surface transportation is required for
  delivery to the user, or if storage time, storage conditions, or mode of transportation is
  unknown, then a higher level of packing must be used. CAUTION: Containerized hazardous
  materials are not air-eligible cargo. See AFMAN 24-204(I) and 49 CFR.

                     AIR FORCE REUSABLE CONTAINER PROGRAM

9.1. General Information.
     9.1.1. The Air Force Reusable Container Program is an efficient and effective program to
     satisfy the most demanding packaging requirements. This program is designed to pay
     minimum cost in packaging and maintaining high levels of protection for assets during
     storage or shipment. Savings in logistics costs are being realized by this program.
     Reusable containers provide superior packaging protection and performance of critical
     spare parts and increase the reliability of weapons systems. By taking maximum advantage
     of recovering and utilizing reusable containers, packaging costs are reduced, new
     acquisitions of expensive containers are minimized; materiel waste stream (disposal of
     cushioning) is reduced; war-winning capabilities are enhanced through the continuous flow
     of serviceable weapon system specific parts. Lost or missing containers slow down the
     flow of aircraft parts.
     9.1.2. Reusable containers are a shipping and storage container that can be reused without
     impairment of its protective function; and which can be repaired or retrofitted to prolong its
     serviceable life. Reusable containers can be modified for shipment of like items other than
     that for which it was originally intended. They must maintain a high rate of re-use due to the
     nature and value of these items and the Air Force’s diverse logistical requirements. Many
     items can be reused after undergoing recalibration, repair, or retrofitting, but cannot be made
     serviceable by the using base. These items must be returned to the ALC or TRC. Such items
     may include reparable and technical order time change items. Moreover, many of these items
     are assigned reusable containers. Items that are ERRC “T” coded as depot reparable shall
     have a SPI, whether a drawing, Fast Pack or Standard Pack. Other selected items that are not
     depot reparable can also be covered by SPIs based on item characteristics. Although Fast
     Packs are a type of SPI, Fast Packs shall not be depicted in a discreet SPI drawing. Special
     Packaging        Instruction      Retrieval     &      Exchange          System       (SPIRES)
     (https://spires.wpafb.af.mil/) provides the capability to cross-level AF and Contractor
     Supported Weapon System (CSWS) NSN to SPI data (e.g. SPI drawings, Fast Packs and
     standard packs). Additional guidance on SPIRES is found in paragraph 9.6.11 Reusable
     Container Worldwide Warehouse (RECON) (https://recon.wpafb.af.mil/), is a tool that
     cross-levels excess reusable containers and/or packaging materiel from CONUS/OCONUS
     bases, provides worldwide visibility and matches warfighters’ reusable container needs.
     9.1.3. Intermodal containers are not covered under this program. Additional guidance on
     intermodal containers can be found in Chapter 14.
9.2. Serviceable Reusable Containers. To be serviceable, reusable containers must meet all of
the following requirements:
     9.2.1. Protect serviceable items against natural and induced environments and physical
     damage.
     9.2.2. Protect unserviceable items against further deterioration during return to the ALC or
     TRC.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           85


   9.2.3. Be opened and closed without impairing the container's ability to provide its original
   level of protection.
   9.2.4. Have all its components and are in good repair.
   9.2.5. Endure the shipping, handling and storage environment for the number of trips required
   to yield the lowest total packaging, maintenance, storage and transportation costs for the
   expected lifetime of the item it protects.
9.3. Categories of Reusable Containers. Reusable containers fall into four categories,
depending on the durability of the exterior shipping container and complexity of the design:
   9.3.1. Long life containers. Effective for 100 trips minimum. A shipping container that can
   be used repeatedly and whose serviceability can be expected to equal the serviceability
   of the item it is designed to protect. These containers may be refurbished by appropriate
   maintenance practices to their original condition and re-used. NOTE: Slotted angle crates,
   covered by NSNs in Federal Supply Classifications (FSC) 8140 and 8145, are long life
   containers. Slotted angle containers can be constructed and repaired at base level.
   9.3.2. Short life containers. Effective for 10 trips minimum. A shipping container that can be
   re-used for a limited number of times. The container is usually made of wood, plywood,
   fiberboard or similar material that has limited serviceability.
   9.3.3. Multi-application containers. Multi-application containers are designed to protect a
   variety of components within a given fragility and size range. All multi-application
   containers are assigned a National Stock Number (NSN). A multi-application container can
   be either short life or long life. They can be manufactured in a similar manner to that used for
   specialized containers or in accordance with applicable military/federal specifications. Short
   life multi-application containers include Fast Packs, consisting of a family of standard size
   cushioned fiberboard shipping containers. Short life multi-application containers are
   designated as Types I thru IV in MIL-STD-2073-1. Long life multi-application containers are
   made of rugged plastic containing internal cushioning pads or permanent shock mitigation
   systems (e.g. shear mounts, steel coils and springs) and designed to protect reparable
   components during forward and retrograde movements within the Defense Transportation
   System (DTS). Long life multi-application containers are designated as Types VI thru X in
   MIL-STD-2073-1.
   9.3.4. Specialized Containers. Specialized containers are generally long life and are uniquely
   configured to protect a specific item, or limited variety of items during handling, shipping
   and storage or to protect personnel and equipment from hazardous contents. These
   containers are made of metal (e.g. extruded aluminum or steel), fiberglass, plastic, or other
   synthetic materials that are fabricated and produced by industrial equipment according to
   engineering specifications. Containers of this type incorporate many special features (e.g.
   energy absorbing systems, temperature control systems and permanent shock mitigation
   systems, etc.). Engineering drawings define form, fit, function, materials, tolerances and
   fabrication techniques. Internal fixtures or other fitments within result from original design
   or redesign modifications to meet specific weapon systems applications.
9.4. Types of SPI Containers. There are three types of SPI containers (packs) for Air Force
depot or TRC reparables, serviceables and other selected items:
86                                            AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


     9.4.1. Fast Packs. Fast Pack containers are a complete shipping and storage system that
     integrates interior cushioning material with the exterior container. Fast Packs are
     designed for recovery and re-use. A key advantage of Fast Packs is versatility. About ninety
     (90) percent of the items assigned to Fast Packs are either in the slide or star type pack. The
     versatility of Fast Packs is evident when over thirty one thousand (31,000) line items can be
     packed in four (4) sizes of Type II slide packs. Complete details for the construction and
     sizes are outlined in PPP-B-1672, Box, Shipping, Reusable with Cushioning. T.O. 00-85B-3,
     How to Package Air Force Spares, describes the Fast Pack SPI numbering system and is
     used by bases in selecting the proper Fast Pack for shipment of items not covered by a SPI.
     Additional detailed information regarding weight limits and fragility range of items
     applicable to these packs may be found in MIL-STD-2073-1. Fast Packs consist of four
     types. These four container types are:
        9.4.1.1. Type I (Vertical Star Pack). Consists of a polyurethane foam cushion insert with a
        die-cut, star shaped, vertical cavity and top and bottom pads of the same material
        assembled in the container. Type I is used for packaging fragile items, either rectangular
        or cylindrical in shape, such as meters, gauges and instruments (e.g. air speed indicators).
        Items packaged in this star pack type are inserted into the cavity from the top of the
        container prior to placing the top pad in place.
            9.4.1.1.1. Style A – Regular slotted carton (RSC)
            9.4.1.1.2. Style B – Double cover container (DBLCC)
            9.4.1.1.3. Style C – Modified double cover container (Mod DBLCC)
        9.4.1.2. Type II (Modified Triple Slide (Convoluted Foam) Folding Pack). Consists of a
        convoluted polyurethane foam cushion bonded to container board. This assembly is
        subsequently folded up to become the slide of a modified triple slide box. The cushioning
        provides maximum protection against shock, while holding the item in place by pre-
        compression of the convoluted tips. Type II is used for circuit boards, electronic modules
        glass envelope electronic tubes. It is also used for a variety of other items whose depth
        does not exceed the limits of the size of the containers.
        9.4.1.3. Type III (Full Telescoping Encapsulated Pack). Consists of a telescoping
        container with bonded convoluted (some end and side pads are flat sheet stock)
        polyurethane foam cushioning which forms an oblong cavity. Type III is used to pack
        black-box equipment such as receiver-transmitters, amplifiers, power supply units and
        electronic indicators.
        9.4.1.4. Type IV (Double Cover Horizontal Star Pack). Consists of a two piece (top and
        bottom) polyurethane foam insert, which forms a star shaped cavity when the two pieces
        are mated in conjunction with end pads of flat sheet stock. The insert components and
        end pads are bonded in place in a half telescoping container fabricated in accordance with
        ASTM-D5118, Type CF, Style DBLCC. The cushioning insert is similar to the Type I
        star pack insert except that it is cut along (horizontal) its greatest dimensional length to
        facilitate insertion (loading) and extraction of relatively long, rectangular or cylindrical
        items such as control generators, voltage regulators, volt-meters, electronic receivers,
        protection panels, transmitters, transformers, couplers and amplifiers.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          87


   9.4.2. Standard Packs. Standard packs are ASTM D5118, Type RSC, Class Weather-
   Resistant fiberboard containers. Standard packs, for which the packaging components
   (including the shipping container) are standardized as to materiel and size. Appropriate items
   require less cushioning protection than Fast Pack items. The cushioning in a standard pack is
   not bonded to the container walls and varies according to the instruction code in the standard
   pack SPI number. Because many different items are assigned to each standard pack, the
   reusability is increased. An example of a standard pack number is F000004D38. Refer to
   T.O. 00-85B-3 for complete details on defining standard pack numbering positions which
   specifies packaging data (e.g. preservation code, wrap, barrier and cushioning needed and
   container size code to protect the items).
   9.4.3. SPI Drawings. SPI drawings are detailed packaging instructions, usually packaging
   data with 3-D drawing (graphic) illustration, used to construct packages/containers for items
   requiring special preservation, packing and protection. A SPI drawing generally depicts
   details for special blocking, bracing, cushioning, shock mounts, tie-down devices and
   positioning of the item in the package/container. Additionally, a SPI describes the bill of
   materials, container system illustrations, preservation and packaging requirements for one
   item or a limited group of items of similar form, fit and function. Unless otherwise specified,
   DD Forms 2169 and 2169C shall be used when a SPI is required. Additional guidance on DD
   Forms       2169     and     2169C      is     found     in     MIL-STD-2073-1.       SPIRES
   (https://spires.wpafb.af.mil/) provides bases and users the capability to retrieve (download)
   SPI drawings assigned to NSNs. Additional guidance on SPIRES is found in paragraph
   9.6.11.
      9.4.3.1. SPI numbers follow a DOD standard numbering system with Service
      Designator + National Item Identification Number (NIIN) (e.g. F000519053).
      9.4.3.2. Refer to the SPI drawing to manufacture or fabricate the container and for
      packing the item.
9.5. Packaging Engineering and Repair Capabilities.
   9.5.1. AFMC LSO/LOP (AFPTEF Wright-Patterson AFB) and AAC/YBC (Eglin AFB)
   have full container design, build, engineering and repair capabilities to support long life,
   short life, multi-application and specialized containers.
   9.5.2. AFMC LSO/LOP (AFPTEF), upon request on a fee-for-service basis, will provide
   container engineering design, modification, test and evaluation identified by units to
   accomplish mission requirements. Additional AFPTEF guidance is found in Chapter 10.
   9.5.3. Main Operating Bases (MOB) which have full maintenance capability may repair
   specialized long life containers and control them as an accountable item of supply.
   9.5.4. Base TMFs generally do not have the resources (facilities, capability and materials) to
   design, build and repair long life and specialized containers.
   9.5.5. Base TMF’s usually have the materials and ability to build, repair, or refurbish
   multiapplicaton short life containers. Fast Packs may be refurbished by replacing serviceable
   parts. For example, use serviceable cushioning inserts from worn-out Fast Packs in other

9.6. Controlling Reusable Containers.
88                                            AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


     9.6.1. AFMAN 23-110, volume 1, part 1, chapter 10, section W, Container Management,
     assigns engineering responsibility to the using systems manager (SM), or the end-article
     Item Manager (IM) and prescribes procedures for stock listing, managing, controlling and
     returning containers to supply.
     9.6.2. AFMAN 23-110, volume I, part two, chapter 2, identifies management
     responsibilities. For items without an assigned IM, contact the ALC, Product Center, or TRC
     in your geographical area.
     9.6.3. Specialized and multi-application long life containers are subject to AFMAN 23-110
     management, accountability and control procedures.
     9.6.4. Short life and multi-application short life containers are not subject to AFMAN 23-
     110 management, accountability and control procedures once issued for use.
     9.6.5. Stock Listing Short Life and Multi-Application Containers. Short life and multi-
     application containers are stocklisted for central buying and stocking by GSA (see T.O.
     00-85B-3). The prime ALC packaging office works with the IM (or appropriate SM) to
     begin stock listing of these containers in FSC 8110 and 8115 when all these conditions apply:
        9.6.5.1. The volume of usage makes it economical.
        9.6.5.2. A continuing requirement exists.
        9.6.5.3. The pack has multiple applications (as in Fast Packs discussed in TO 00-85B-3).
     9.6.6. Ogden ALC has prime class management responsibilities for FSC 8140
     specialized and multi-application long life containers. Warner Robins ALC has prime class
     management responsibilities for FSC 8145 specialized and multi-application long life
     containers.
     9.6.7. The acquiring activity oversees testing, engineering, and renovating for surplus FSC
     8140 and 8145 containers acquired through the CDRS.
     9.6.8. The prime ALC does not purchase, repair, or re-engineer FSC 8140 and 8145 surplus
     reusable containers transferred to other activities.
     9.6.9. Active reusable containers include all containers for which an immediate or
     projected need exists.
        9.6.9.1. When active reusable SPI containers for most depot reparable items are
        empty, then recover and re-use them within the reusable container program.
        9.6.9.2. Some specialized long-life containers, munitions containers and engine
        containers will be turned-in to LRS Materiel Management Flight or accounted for in
        munitions and engine accounts. Containers managed within the reusable container
        program are not accounted for in special accounts or LRS Materiel Management
        Flight. They are considered a part of, and identified to, the item packed inside during
        shipment and storage. Munitions containers with budget code “H,” FSC code 8140 and
        ERRC XD2 will be managed by the munitions community in CAS. Excess munitions
        reusable containers may be dispositioned for redistribution in RECON.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                      89


  9.6.10. Specialized Containers Not-In-Use. Return FSC 8140 and 8145 specialized
  containers to LRS Materiel Management Flight accountability when any of these conditions
  applies:
     9.6.10.1. Containers are not in use.
     9.6.10.2. An immediate or projected need can not be identified.
     9.6.10.3. Containers are not managed in separate accounts (such as engines).
     9.6.10.4. When using or packaging activities turn-in unused specialized containers to
     TMF, the TMF reports them to the IM or SM as available for redistribution. The IM
     reports them to Eglin CDRS office for redistribution.
  9.6.11. Identifying, Retrieving and Exchanging SPIs.
     9.6.11.1. Special Packaging Instructions Retrieval & Exchange System (SPIRES).
     SPIRES is used worldwide by AF units of varying types with varying missions. Units
     can retrieve AF and CSWS managed weapon system specific SPIs 24x7 for preparing
     materiel for shipment or storage by accessing SPIRES at https://spires.wpafb.af.mil.
     9.6.11.2. SPIRES shall be used as the AF centralized electronic library for AF managed
     and AF Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) Inventory Control Points (ICPs)
     weapon system specific SPIs.
     9.6.11.3. The prime ALC packaging office archives SPI drawings. As required, hard
     copies of SPIs are obtained from the prime ALC packaging office when unavailable in
     SPIRES or if the internet is inaccessible. In addition, the prime ALC packaging office
     can assist if there are any specific questions about item(s) characteristics and their
     assigned SPIs.
     9.6.11.4. At the discretion of the TO, weapon system specific SPIs which are commonly
     used may be locally maintained for mobility, contingency planning and operational non-
     availability of computer resources (downtime). Maintaining SPI libraries and performing
     SPI reconciliation is no longer required.
     9.6.11.5. The prime ALC packaging office SPI developers/illustrators and CSWS
     Inventory Control Points (ICP) shall exchange (upload) SPIs in SPIRES. Copies of
     SPIs can be exchanged in AutoCad DWG, Adobe Acrobat PDF and Microsoft Word
     DOC (image) formats. SPIs are retrieved and viewed by the warfighters in Adobe
     Acrobat PDF and Microsoft Word DOC format. SPIs can be queried by many different
     attributes (e.g. SPI No., NSN, FSC, NIIN, MMAC and SOS).
     9.6.11.6. The SPIRES database stores and displays information from the depot D035T
     (Packaging, Transportation and Regulated Material) item records along with SPI
     attributes exchanged by the ALC developers/illustrators who draw up the SPIs. This data
     system interface process enables any discrepancies or data inconsistencies to be flagged
     for resolution by the prime ALC packaging office.
     9.6.11.7. Jet and reciprocating aircraft engines and certain munitions, are exceptions to
     the SPI system. T.O. 00-85-20, Engine Shipping Instructions, identifies containers for
     engines.
90                                              AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


        9.6.11.8. The Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) stores the SPI number as part of
        the item record, and prints them in-the-clear on off-base issue, due-out release, and
        shipment documents. SBSS receives the SPI number through the Stock Number User
        Directory (SNUD) and depot D035T system interface.
        9.6.11.9. The SBSS computer will store and print SPI numbers and other packaging
        instructions in "Freight Classification Nomenclature" block of the DD Form 1348-1A.
        These entries will be followed by the Routing Identifier Code (RIC) of the prime ALC
        managing the SPI. The SBSS provides the following SPI information:
            9.6.11.9.1. SPI number. Ten-alphanumeric positions followed by the RIC. For
            example, SPI F003036728 FHZ.
            9.6.11.9.2. Fast Pack SPI number. Ten alphanumeric positions. For example, the
            preservation and pack code (the third from last position) will always be an "X"
            preceded by the preservation code and five zeros: F000004XC1 (RIC).
            9.6.11.9.3. Standard pack SPI number. Ten alphanumeric positions. For example, the
            preservation code, simple instruction code, and container size code preceded by five
            zeros: F000004C01 (RIC).
     9.6.12. Requesting SPI Waiver Authority to Deviate. While the prime ALC packaging
     office strives to minimize deviations, SPI waivers are sometimes necessary. This flexibility
     is required to accomplish mission objectives. Requests for SPI waiver authority to deviate are
     processed by the prime ALC packaging office if no SPI is available to accomplish immediate
     mission support. A waiver authority number to deviate and applicable instructions will be
     provided. Mark the waiver number on the lower right hand portion of the identification side
     of the container(s) prior to movement and annotate same on the shipping document. Follow
     paragraph 9.6.12.1 information to provide when requesting SPI waiver.
        9.6.12.1. When requesting SPI waivers include the following information to the prime
        ALC packaging specialist:
            9.6.12.1.1. TCN
            9.6.12.1.2. NSN
            9.6.12.1.3. Nomenclature
            9.6.12.1.4. Quantity
            9.6.12.1.5. SPI Number
            9.6.12.1.6. Condition of Materiel
            9.6.12.1.7. Justification for waiver
            9.6.12.1.8. Replacement container
            9.6.12.1.9. Requester email and phone number.
        9.6.12.2. Routing Identifier Codes (RIC), mailing and message addresses for
        requesting SPI
         waiver authority to deviate are as follows:

  9.6.13. Obtaining Assistance When No SPI Container Is Available. If a SPI container cannot
  be fabricated at the base or a SPI container is not available (e.g. new items, lost, damaged or
  destroyed containers and Credit Due-In From Maintenance (DIFM)), take one of these
  actions:
       9.6.13.1. Scope RECON for SPI container availability and acquire the SPI container as
       a lateral support asset from bases within the same command or the same overseas theater.
       9.6.13.2. Request SPI waiver authority to deviate from the prime ALC packaging office
       authorizing the use of a suitable replacement or alternate pack. Alternate packs may be
       authorized to meet shipping deadlines. Provide the prime ALC packaging office with
       item and packing details for waiver applicability. A waiver authority number to deviate
       and applicable instructions will be provided.
       9.6.13.3. Purchase locally the services or materials to fabricate an approved SPI
       container if the base has the capability. Order Fast Packs and Standard Packs from
92                                            AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


        General Services Administration (GSA) or fabricate SPI packs, when required. Use AF
        Form 451 when fabricating SPI packs, as outlined in Attachment 5.
        9.6.13.4. If the SPI container can not be laterally supported or if there is no local
        packaging capability, then contact the closest ALC packaging office or TRC and request
        lateral support fabrication for the necessary container(s). Use AF Form 451 when
        requesting packaging services.
        9.6.13.5. For a long life or stock listed container, submit a requisition, through TMF
        channels. Include the following information:
            9.6.13.5.1. SPI Number
            9.6.13.5.2. Quantity
            9.6.13.5.3. National Stock Number
            9.6.13.5.4. Ship-To Address
            9.6.13.5.5. Fund Cite
            9.6.13.5.6. Intended Use (shipment or storage)
            9.6.13.5.7. Point of Contact, (include office symbol and phone number)
            9.6.13.5.8. Squadron level authorizing signature
            9.6.13.5.9. Any other applicable information
        9.6.13.6. For items issued under the credit DIFM concept, where the reparable item is
        turned in to supply before the serviceable item is issued, the AF Form 451 must have
        "Credit DIFM – No Reusable Container Issued/Available." Supply will record on the
        shipping document "Credit DIFM - No Reusable Container Issued/Available." Delays
        can be avoided if maintenance units will ensure that the specified container is available.
        9.6.13.7. For SPI containers without stock numbers, contact the prime ALC packaging
        office.
        9.6.13.8. For SPI containers that are Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS)
        managed, contact the applicable contractor source of supply for disposition instructions.
        9.6.13.9. The requesting activity is responsible for all materials and transportation costs
        for fabricated containers and/or the total contract cost associated with their fabrication.
9.7. Excess Reusable Containers for Redistribution. When an activity generates a local
excess over current or projected requirements, identify, segregate and inspect the condition of
the containers. Additional details are as follows:
     9.7.1. Excess Specialized Containers.
        9.7.1.1. Turn in those containers traced to a valid NSN to engine or munition accounts,
        as appropriate, for redistribution action. Redistribute containers that are separately
        accounted for only at the disposition of the IM.
        9.7.1.2. Attempt to cross-level trace to an NSN or SPI number any container not cross
        referenced to an NSN. You may request assistance from base TMF, an ALC packaging
        office or Container Design & Retrieval System (CDRS) office.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         93


     9.7.1.3. TMF may request assistance from the prime ALC packaging office responsible
     for the SPI when redistributing specialized containers that have not been separately
     accounted for.
     9.7.1.4. Because these containers generally are in short supply and may be needed for
     packing other items on the SPI, the TMF will identify these containers in CDRS and
     redistribute directly to other Air Force units needing them.
     9.7.1.5. Contact the IM and request instructions. If the IM does not need the containers
     for any purpose, contact the prime ALC packaging office or CDRS office to find a use
     for the containers. The prime ALC packaging office may have disposition instruction.
     The CDRS database is populated with most of the specialized/engineered FSC 8140 and
     8145 shipping and storage containers from the FEDLOG system. If the containers are
     high quality containers with high value for future applications, the CDRS office may
     request the containers be sent to their station for storage. The CDRS office may look for
     storage options while looking for a using customer for the containers.
     9.7.1.6. Do not transfer specialized or multi-application long life containers to the
     Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) unless directed in writing by the
     IM. As a last resort, after exhausting all available means (CDRS, MAJCOM disposition
     requests, lateral support) to redistribute these containers to other Air Force units and
     written IM disposition instructions, then the containers can be turned-in to DRMO for
     recycling and/or resale.
     9.7.1.7. The requesting unit is responsible for all transportation (shipping and
     handling) costs associated with sending the reusable containers to a storage activity.
  9.7.2. Excess Long Life, Short Life and Multi-Application Containers (Non-
  Specialized). Use RECON to report excess serviceable non-specialized reusable
  containers (including containers for assets no longer on-hand) when the quantity or
  economic value justifies the cost of redistributing them. For unserviceable containers that
  are beyond economical repair, DRMO resell of non-usable excess for recycling is the
  preferred method of disposal.
     9.7.2.1. Redistribution of RECON containers may be funded by AF Working Capital
     Fund (AFWCF) or unit funds. To determine whether or not a container qualifies as
     AFWCF, access the Tracker system, Logistics Data Queries, and use the NIIN/TAC
     query. Refer to the AF cargo funding memorandum (see Chapter 7) for a table of
     AFWCF Transportation Account Codes (TACs) to use (based on budget code). When
     using an AFWCF TAC, ensure the NSN is included on the shipping document, otherwise
     payment on the TAC will be denied. Some of the reusable containers maintained in
     SPIRES (FSC 8115, 8135, 8145 and 9330 materiel) are non-AFWCF, and will reflect an
     alpha budget code or no budget code at all. These shall be funded by the unit’s local
     O&M funds. Contact the appropriate Item Manager (IM) for disposition instructions and
     possible funding options. For non-RECON supported disposition requests, the requesting
     activity is responsible for all transportation (shipping and handling) costs associated with
     container redistribution. Use "Mode I" for Inland OCONUS.
     9.7.2.2. Deliver SPI packs and wood containers to the storage site in a setup condition;
     deliver Tri-wall and fiberboard boxes knocked-down.
94                                             AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


     9.7.3. Excess Consolidation Containers.
        9.7.3.1. Bundle excess used consolidation containers in serviceable condition and report
        them in RECON for disposition and/or lateral support. Return them to the nearest ALC,
        Air Force unit, or other service activities with a valid need by opportune airlift or other
        low-cost transportation.
        9.7.3.2. Flatten disposal containers that are not recovered before they are placed in
        refuse receptacles or pickup sites.
     9.7.4. Excess Consumable Packs and Packing Materials.
        9.7.4.1. Recover and segregate by class and grade all excess reusable packs and packing
        materials (e.g. polyurethane foam cushioning) used to ship consumable items. Ensure
        personnel place packs and packing materials in designated recycling receptacles for re-
        use.
        9.7.4.2. Use RECON to report excess packing materials when the quantity or economic
        value justifies the cost of redistribution.
     9.7.5. Items Inside Recovered Containers.
        9.7.5.1. Be sure that containers are empty before you redistribute, recycle or dispose of
        them.
        9.7.5.2. Return items found in recovered containers to the accountable unit. If the item
        or unit cannot be identified from the container, turn-in the item to Materiel Management
        or Flight Service Center as Found On Base (FOB).
9.8. Selecting and Designing Specialized Long life Containers. These procedures shall be
followed when selecting and designing long life containers:
     9.8.1. The AFPTEF shall review and approve any specifications and statements of
     objectives/statements of work before you procure new long life container designs. Utilize
     the AFPTEF. Activities shall consider the in-house design, prototype, test and evaluation
     capabilities of the AFPTEF before soliciting/contracting such work out. Additional details
     are contained in Chapter 15 herein.
     9.8.2. Use the CDRS to determine if a design already exists to satisfy the mission support
     requirements. MIL-STD-2073-1 contains instructions on how to use CDRS.
        9.8.2.1. After selecting a standardized off-the-shelf container or approving a newly
        designed long life container, the buying activity must send the design data to:
        AAC/ACSSS (CDRS Office), 615 Apalachicola Rd, Suite 101, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-
        6845. DSN 875-3509, Commercial (850) 883-3509. Fax: 850-882-9381. Follow the
        procedures in MIL-STD-2073-1 for submitting new designs to CDRS.
     9.8.3. Contact the prime ALC packaging office. Give preference to standardized off-the-
     shelf containers or standard designs that meet the long life performance requirement.
     9.8.4. If no standardized off-the-shelf container will satisfy the mission requirement, contact
     AFMC LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) for guidance on the design, build and testing of new long life or
     specialized containers (non-munitions) or AAC/ACSSS (CDRS Office) for specialized
     munitions containers.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          95


9.9. Container Standardization. To promote standardization, a series of standard size
containers are established for certain types of multi-application short life SPI packs (e.g.
Fast Packs and Standard Packs). Standardization reduces the cost of fiberboard shipping
containers, simplifies load planning, stacking, storage and reuse. Costs are reduced through
central purchase of large production runs.
   9.9.1. Adding New Multi-application Containers. AFMC LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) must approve
   recommendations for adding new multi-application containers to Air Force packaging
   systems before you develop or use them. AFMC LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) recommends
   approved multi-application containers with potential high use for inclusion in MIL-STD-
   2073-1.
9.10. Reusable Container Program Implementation Guidance.
   9.10.1. Program Roles and Responsibilities. At Installation/Wing/ALC level, an effective
   reusable container program shall be established and implemented, maximizing recovery
   and reuse. This includes but is not limited to reimbursement and transfer of funds from
   host/tenant units for packaging services; lost, destroyed or discarded Fast Packs, standard
   packs, SPI shipping containers, packaging materials; labor hours for constructing or
   replacing SPI containers and commercial transportation (shipping and handling) costs.
   This gives the Wing and/or ALC direct control over their program so they can adapt it to
   specific mission requirements. Following are responsibilities of the BCM and UCM:
       9.10.1.1. The BCM or their designated representative shall ensure that all activities that
       receive, store, issue or ship government materiel:
          9.10.1.1.1. Implement procedures for control, recovery and re-use of reusable
          containers, packaging materials, reimbursement or prior transfer of funds for
          packaging costs.
          9.10.1.1.2. Ensure unit commanders appoint UCMs (primary and alternates) to
          establish and execute a viable, effective program. Units that utilize fewer than
          three (3) SPI containers, excluding Fast Packs, have the option not to have a
          flight/unit RCP at the discretion of the BCM.
          9.10.1.1.3. Ensure the using organizational flights and the TMF recovers and re-
          uses prescribed active government owned short and long-life reusable containers and
          other specialized containers (FSC 8115, 8140 and 8145) that are accounted for by
          Materiel Management and engine accounts.
          9.10.1.1.4. Provide training and awareness to personnel assigned to non-

AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        97


     recovery and reuse of SPI containers. Program instructions implementing these
     procedures shall address the following:
        9.10.1.3.1. Identify procedures and responsibilities for receipt, storage, issue,
        recovery, turn-in, screening, reporting and recycling of reusable containers and
        packing materials. Ensure that reusable containers are separated from refuse (trash)
        and supply pickup sites.
        9.10.1.3.2. Identify procedures and responsibilities for recovering excess serviceable
        reusable containers and/or packaging materiel. Emphasize that reusable containers
        (non-specialized) and packaging materiel excess to the mission be listed on RECON
        for lateral support to other potential bases/units, where needed. Ensure effective
        methods and process for screening of reusable containers and packing materiel
        from recycling sites and waste streams (landfills, DRMO, etc.) are established.
        Reusable containers must not be needlessly discarded in waste receptacles or
        transferred to the DRMO unless directed in writing by the IM. If unable to re-
        distribute, then contact the prime ALC Item Manager (IM) for disposition.
        9.10.1.3.3. Implement training procedures and responsibilities for using
        organizational flights. Generally, training will be performed by the BCM. At a
        minimum, training will include: identification and safeguarding of reusable
        containers and associated packaging materiel, procedures and responsibilities for
        processing AF Forms 451 for packaging services to include reimbursement of
        funds, replacement for wear and tear, lost, destroyed or discarded reusable
        containers. Include grading and marking standards of packaging materiel and lumber
        products used in CONUS and OCONUS. Familiarize personnel to regulations and
        standards associated with the packaging industry, both domestic and international.
        Emphasize requirements and mission support with packaging, handling, storing
        and movement of Air Force assets.
        9.10.1.3.4. Using Organizational Flights must ensure the issued item is not separated
        from its specified container. Transfer the item and the container at the same time.
        Flights requiring second-level repair, periodic bench check, build-up, etc., must
        ensure that the specified container and item are promptly reunited. Upon receipt of
        the item from LRS Materiel Management Flight, ensure the required container is
        available. If the item is received without the required container, annotate on the issue
        document "No SPI container available.” AF Form 451 must be used for all items
        without the required SPI or Fast Pack before shipment turn-in to transportation. TMF
        will maintain a list of unit RCP managers and alternates authorized to sign AF Form
        451. Ensure that copies of SF 364 (ROD) and AF Form 451 are kept with the
        container if the item is in the wrong container. The BCM will forward all AF Form
        451s with all costs of packing to the LRS Resource Adviser (RA). The LRS RA will
        forward to the unit RAs. Packaging services costs will be reimbursed to LRS Cargo
        Movement account.
        9.10.1.3.5. Organizational flights requiring packaging services will complete an
        AF Form451. This form is supporting documentation for obligations made using AF
        Form 616 (or other instruments of payment) and can only be signed by the UCM.
        AF Form 451 will stay with the item during the turn-in cycle and will be
98                                       AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


        administered by the TMF packaging section. AF Form 451 will accompany all
        items turned-in to TMF without prescribed SPI or Fast Pack containers. Items in
        which the proper containers cannot be located, or incorrect containers accompany
        the items, will not be accepted for turn-in without this form. When processing AF
        Forms 451 received from organizational units, annotate the necessary packaging
        materials and labor expenditures for direct packaging services payment
        accountability. All shipping and packaging materials costs incurred are subject to
        reimbursement or prior transfer of funds to procure packaging materials before
        shipment turn-in to transportation. When a unit brings an incorrect container and the
        SPI specifies a more expensive container, then either charge the unit for the use of
        the specified SPI container and give the incorrect container back to the unit, or
        charge the unit the difference between the specified SPI container and the incorrect
        container. Additional guidance in preparing AF Form 451 is found in Attachment
        5.
        9.10.1.3.6. Establish a base reusable container working group, composed of
        journeyman-level representatives from TMF, maintenance and other major using
        groups and resource advisors. This working group will be chaired by the installation
        RCP Manager. Further, this working group will meet annually (and as needed) to
        coordinate actions, analyze budgetary and operational requirements, evaluate
        number of containers lost or destroyed and replacement cost, indications of
        negligence in discarding reusable containers and packing materials, number of
        excess reusable containers on-hand and status of disposition, address deficiencies and
        recommend corrective actions necessary for executing an effective and efficient base
        reusable container program.
        9.10.1.3.7. Establish UCMs to assist unit commanders by ensuring flights are
        responsible for identifying, storing, protecting, recovering and reusing containers
        identified herein.
        9.10.1.3.8. Identify procedures for evaluating deficiencies in the RCP. Establish
        procedures for performing corrective action and flight inspections. Review the AF
        Form 451, SF 364 and requests for SPI waiver authority to deviate.
        9.10.1.3.9. Identify goals and procedures for evaluating and measuring the
        effectiveness and efficiency of the RCP.
        9.10.1.3.10. Ensure organizational flights provide a covered, clean, dry space to
        protect reusable containers and packing materials from inclement weather during
        storage.
     9.10.1.4. Program Evaluation and Efficiency.
        9.10.1.4.1. The following goals are established to enhance the RCP: Improve
        training and awareness; Eliminate reusable container loss, unauthorized waste and
        destruction; Promote reusable container conservation.
        9.10.1.4.2. To measure program effectiveness and efficiency, BCMs will perform
        semi-annual inspections of organizational units reusable container storage areas.
        BCMs will prepare and utilize the semi-annual report. Report distribution will include
        installation, group and applicable unit commanders, primary UCMs, and upon
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                     99

          9.10.1.4.2.3. Shipping Delays.
             9.10.1.4.2.3.1. The objective of measuring shipping delays is to elevate
             program awareness by how the loss/destruction of reusable containers can
             impact the base mission.
             9.10.1.4.2.3.2. To measure, AF Form 451s will be annotated when the item is
             received and the date the item is packaged. The delay is the total days
             accrued between these dates.

              DISCREPANCY REPORTS AND TRACING PROCEDURES

10.1. Inspection. Inspect items systematically to prevent loss or damage from the time you
receive them until you use or dispose of them. Report defects to help the packaging designer
eliminate future damage.
10.2. Responsibilities of the Shipping Activity.
   10.2.1. The shipping activity must package materiel to prevent damage during shipment.
   10.2.2. Personnel performing packaging functions must             meet   minimum      training
   requirements or be supervised by fully trained personnel.
   10.2.3. When the shipping activity receives SF 364, Report of Discrepancy (ROD) or
   electronic Shipment Discrepancy Report (SDR) via WebSDR, they must notify responsible
   persons of deficiencies. They must train their personnel to correct deficiencies.
10.3. Damage Control in Receiving Activities. When you receive a shipment, check to:
   10.3.1. Determine if damage occurred during transit.
   10.3.2. Determine if the item is packaged according to the prescribed packaging
   requirements.
   10.3.3. Ensure adequate packaging is at the proper level to prevent corrosion or deterioration
   during storage.
10.4. Procedures for Stored Items. DOD Regulation 4145.19-1, Storage and Materials
Handling, includes procedures for inspecting stored items.
10.5. Damage to Issues. A major source of damage to delicate items is intrabase transfers.
Protect items that are subject to damage from shock and vibration during handling and
movement.
10.6. Discrepancy Reporting.
   10.6.1. Transportation Discrepancies. TOs process and report over, short, damaged, and
   astray cargo using the DD Form 361, Transportation Discrepancy Report (TDR), in
   compliance with DTR, Part II. Additional information may be found in 41 CFR, Parts 102-
   118, Public Contracts and Property Management. For FMS, refer to Paragraph 10.7 Air
   Force shipping activities are also required to report miscellaneous transportation
   discrepancies. Refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 210, Paragraph H.1., and Appendix I.
   Particular attention will be directed to shipment discrepancies involving TPS and
   HAZMAT shipments.
       10.6.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) TO will send all TDRs sent/received by email to
       AFSPC/A4R by the 5th working day of each month.
   10.6.2. Packaging Discrepancies. When you note shipment damage, packaging deficiencies
   and container marking problems, make the necessary corrections using an electronic
   Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) via the DoD WebSDR system. In the absence of DoD
   WebSDR, use the SF 364. Submit an online System Access Request (SAR) to DAASC for
102                                           AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


   requesting Users’ IDs and passwords to access the DoD WebSDR system at
   https://www.daas.dla.mil/daashome/. Air Force submitters shall use the exact
   identification of four-digit (e.g. P201) packaging discrepancy sub-codes in the DoD
   WebSDR system.
         10.6.2.1. Requirements for Reporting Packaging Discrepancies.
            10.6.2.1.1. When to Complete SF 364. SF 364 will be completed if damage to
            the items occurs and the total cost to correct exceeds $500 per line item or if any of
            the following deficiencies exist, regardless of cost to correct:
            10.6.2.1.2. If the value of the item, shipment or package exceeds $2500.
            10.6.2.1.3. Repetitive deficiencies by a particular activity or repetitive damage
            found upon receipt.
            10.6.2.1.4. Any deficiencies in packaging involving ammunition, explosives, or other
            hazardous materials.
            10.6.2.1.5. Packaging deficiencies resulting in damaged material that may endanger
            life or impair combat or deployment operations.
         10.6.2.2. Compliance With Established Packaging Requirements. Unless items are
         damaged, SF 364 will not be issued against bases or ALCs under the following
         conditions:
            10.6.2.2.1. Items packaged before the current SPI date are acceptable and need not be
            repackaged before shipment.
            10.6.2.2.2. Contractor (with deviation number) or other service packages are
            acceptable for re-use as long as the container is a reusable, rather than one-trip,
            container. The managing packaging office must approve the use of a contractor pack
            by indicating the prime ALC and a deviation number in the lower right corner of the
            exterior container (for example, OC-001). When a contractor pack is used, annotate
            "contractor pack" on the DD Form 1348-1A or condition tag. Contractor packs may
            be recognized by the contractor data markings required by MIL-STD-129, such as
            purchase or delivery order and the name and address of the contractor.
            10.6.2.2.3. The managing packaging office has approved an alternate pack and has
            provided a waiver authority deviation number.
            10.6.2.2.4. Use of the next larger size Fast Pack container for shipments with
            Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue Priority System (UMMIPS) priority 01-08
            if the required Type I (Vertical) or Type II (Slide) is not available. SF 364 will be
            issued if damage occurs or if the next larger size Fast Pack is used for lower priority
            shipments.
            10.6.2.2.5. Use of larger size standard pack containers for shipment of
            unserviceable items when the correct size is unavailable.
      10.6.3. Control Points. AFJMAN 23-215, Reporting of Supply Discrepancies, establishes
      control points for distributing packaging discrepancy reports. Ensure a copy of the
      packaging SDR is provided to the prime ALC packaging office.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          103


10.7. FMS Discrepant Materiel. When FMS discrepant materiel is returned to the custody of
the U.S. Government, the materiel will be turned in on a Supply Discrepancy Report to the
nearest U.S. accountable military activity (regardless of military service responsible for the
materiel) and will be processed in accordance with U.S. procedures. Shipment documentation
retention will be for 2 years at the shipping site and retired to the appropriate Federal Records
Center for a period of 28 years. The shipment must be turned in on a DD Form 1348-1A
showing a proper TAC and DODAAC. No hazardous materials will be accepted without a
properly prepared Shipper’s Declaration of Dangerous Goods. AFJMAN 23-215 is the authority
for this process. For additional information refer to DTR, Part II.
10.8. Suggestions for Improved Packaging. Identify approved or more economical
packaging methods, materials, and techniques by use of SF 364 reports. When submitting a
suggestion recommending an improved pack for a specific national stock number, attach a SF 364
along with supporting photographs if possible that shows the packaging deficiency referenced
and its cause.
10.9. Tracer Action. Tracing shipments that have not been delivered to the destination by the
RDD is an important task. AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual details procedures for
processing and return of the Transportation Tracer Listing (TTL) and the Delinquent Shipment
Listing or R40. The TTL indicates delayed or lost shipments via government transportation
channels. LRS Commanders will establish responsibilities within their squadrons for
completing tracing actions and for tracing shipments valued under $500. TOs will follow the
guidance           in           DTR            Part           II,           Chapter            210
(http://www.transcom.mil/j5/pt/dtrpart2/dtr_part_ii_210.pdf) when tracing efforts do not
locate shipment and a Transportation Discrepancy Report (DD Form 361) must be
accomplished. TOs will ensure an initial attempt is made to collect directly from carriers for lost
(or damaged) shipments valued at less than $500 dollars. If unable to adjudicate under these
local procedures a Transportation Discrepancy Report (DD Form 361) must be accomplished.
Tracer action must be accomplished for all protective and classified, protected or GSA
shipments regardless of dollar value. TOs can obtain shipment information by TCN, BOL or
carrier’s BOL through the GTN at website: https://www.gtn.transcom.mil/index.jsp.
Additional information can be found by accessing the AFMC LSO Tracker System at:
https://tracker.wpafb.af.mil/.
   10.9.1. Inbound Receiving. The Logistics Readiness Squadron Commander is responsible
   for ensuring inbound shipments to their facilities are properly in-checked, inspected and
   receipted. LRS Commanders may provide LRS Management and Systems Flight
   Customer Service personnel limited access to the Inbound Module of CMOS to perform
   research on inbound astray or non-receipted shipments. They will provide a Transportation
   Tracer Listing (TTL) in original and one copy to the Cargo Movement Section twice each
   month. The TTL lists shipments requiring tracer action or receipt information in BOL or
   TCN sequence. If information is incomplete, the Cargo Movement Section will annotate
   accordingly on the listing and return to the Customer Service Section for action. Provide the
   required annotations per AFMAN 23-110, volume 2, part 2, chapter 9 and return the listing to
   the LRS Management and Systems Flight Customer Service Section within 5 workdays of
   receipt.
       10.9.1.1. If an item is missing, LRS Management and Systems Flight Customer Service
       Section will process SF 364 (SDR) according to AFMAN 23-110.
104                                          AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


         10.9.1.2. When the TO receives advance shipping notice or Report of Shipment, they
         will generate DD 361 to satisfy any over/short or damage condition.
   10.9.2. Outbound – Cargo Movement Section will trace originating outbound shipments
   using the R40 (original and one copy), which the Management and Systems Flight
   provides approximately every 2 weeks. The R40 requests the status of originating shipments
   supported by the base level supply system in requisition number sequence. Return the
   annotated R40 listing to the Management and Systems’ document control activity within 5
   business days after receipt (see Para 10.13). NOTE: Efforts are currently ongoing in HQ
   USAF/A4RM to resolve the conflict between Supply inventory reconciliation dollar threshold
   of $100 for missing items, and the Transportation Tracer Listing dollar threshold of $500.
   Pending final resolution, LRS Commanders need to establish and apply cohesive local
   procedures to comply with existing requirements. During self-inspections, staff assistance
   visits or operational readiness inspections, noting the disparity in these two monetary
   thresholds should take into consideration that guidance in higher publications; DoD
   4140.1-R, DOD Supply Chain Materiel Management Regulation, and DLAI 440.55
   (AFJMAN 23-215) Reporting of Supply Discrepancies, are contradictory to TDR policy
   contained in DoD 4500.9R, DTR Part II, Cargo Movement. Air Force Instructions cannot
   contradict existing DoD policy, however, the Air Force position as these DoD documents
   are revised will be that this matter be reconciled at the earliest possible date.
10.10. Disposition of Misdirected Shipments. For astray cargo found in commercial carrier
facilities, see DTR, Part II, for information and guidance on the Joint DOD/GSA Government
Cargo Recovery Efforts (GOCARE), formerly the Astray Cargo Program.
   10.10.1. Re-ship misdirected shipments received through causes other than the commercial
   carrier’s fault to the proper destination. If available, quote the funds on the delivery
   documents to re-ship the misdirected materiel. If fund cite is not available, contact the origin
   shipper. If only the national stock number (NSN) is available, coordinate with servicing base
   Materiel Management Section/item manager for disposition. Errors in a fund cite on the
   origin shipping document must be corrected before onward movement. If available
   information and coordination will not provide a resolution, process through your servicing
   base Management and Systems Flight, Customer Service Section for disposition.
      10.10.2. If the carrier is at fault, ship on a "Free Astray Basis." This includes FMS
      shipments.
   10.10.3. To obtain disposition instructions for misdirected FMS shipments received through
   causes other than the carrier's fault, contact the origin shipping office. If assistance is
   needed, contact AFSAC/COSD, 5490 Pearson Road, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-
   5332 (1-800-448-0361).
10.11. Tracing Process. TOs may use the tracing process to determine the status or location of
shipments that have been delayed, misplaced, or upgraded in priority. Do not initiate tracer action
until the Management and Systems Flight Customer Service Section provides positive
notification that the shipment has been released for movement to the consignee, and that
normal transit time has expired and undue delay has occurred. Initiate tracer action as follows:
   10.11.1. Shipments within CONUS:
         10.11.1.1. NMCS/MICAP, immediately upon request.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         105


       10.11.1.2. Other TP-1 (Expedite), normally not prior to 2 days after shipped date.
       10.11.1.3. TP-2 (Expedite), not prior to 5 days after shipped date, and not later than 10
       days after shipped date.
       10.11.1.4. TP-3 (Routine), not prior to 10 days after shipped date, and not later than 20
       days after shipped date.
   10.11.2. Shipments to/from CONUS and overseas:
       10.11.2.1. 999/NMCS/MICAP, immediately upon request.
       10.11.2.2. Other TP-1 (Expedite), normally not prior to 4 days after shipped date.
       10.11.2.3. TP-2 (Expedite), not prior to 8 days after shipped date, and not later than 14
       days after shipped date.
       10.11.2.4. TP-3 (Routine), not prior to 30 days after shipped date, and not later than 70
       days after shipped date.
10.12. Transportation Tracer Listing (TTL). Compare entries against the property received
files. Annotate each entry after review. The Management and Systems Flight Customer Service
Section should check in Tracker before giving TTL listing to TMF for action, to ensure cargo is
not still at origin. Mark each item on the list with one of the following statements. NOTE: If any
other statement is provided, Customer Service personnel may return the listing to TMF for
appropriate action.
   10.12.1. “Received or in file (date).” This annotation indicates TMF received the shipment
   on base and forwarded it to Logistics Readiness Squadron/Supply Activity for receiving
   action.
   10.12.2. “TMF tracing.” This annotation indicates TMF has initiated tracer action. Trace the
   shipment through automated systems, the carrier, or with the consignor if known. Send tracer
   action requests to the item manager when the consignor can't be identified.
   10.12.3. “Updated shipment status.” This annotation indicates TMF has received updated
   shipment status from the supplier. If Cargo Movement Section information differs with that
   shown on the TTL, circle the outdated transportation data and enter updated status.
   10.12.4. Attach a copy of the DD 361, Transportation Discrepancy Report (TDR), or tracing
   message, to the TTL and annotate "DD 361/Message attached." Preparation and distribution
   of DD 361 is made according to the DTR, Part II.
   10.12.5. If the majority of line items are repeats from the previous TTL, annotate
   "Previously Researched by the Cargo Movement Section,” and return the TTL to the
   Customer Service Section for action.
   10.12.6. The annotation "TM1 action required," requires the Customer Service Section to
   submit a request for transportation status on overseas follow-ups, through DAAS to the Air
   Force Shipper Service Control Office (SSCO), for tracing action.
   10.12.7. “Return the Listing.” TMF will return the annotated TTL to Stock Control within
   5 workdays of receipt. NOTE: TMF may keep copy 2 if desired.

10.13. Delinquent Shipment Listing or R40 Procedures. Compare entries against the property
shipped files. Annotate each entry after review. Return copies of documents with the listing if
they have not previously been provided to the Management and Systems’ document control
activity.
   10.13.1. If the item has been shipped, enter the mode, TCN, date shipped, hold code, etc.
   Alternatively, simply attach a copy of the shipment planning worksheet.
   10.13.2. Enter Julian date shipment was made if confident of the date although unable to
   provide hold data or TCN/GBL.
   10.13.3. Enter "no record of receipt from the Management and Systems’ document control
   activity" if there is no record of the item being received from the Management and Systems’
   document control activity.
   10.13.4. Line out those entries for which movement data was previously submitted.
   10.13.5. Return completed R40 listing to the Management and Systems’ document control
   activity within 5 business days after receipt.
10.14. Additional procedures for CMOS operating locations.
   10.14.1. Check the Volume of the MILSTRIP shipments manually in-checked (without pre-
   positioned data from the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) in file). Too many shipments,
   which have to be manually input, indicate a problem with the Interactive Communication
   Interface (ICI) or SBSS. Check with the Remote Processing Station (RPS) computer room
   supervisor and the LAN manager. Satellite accounts should contact their host SBSS for
   assistance. If all shipments to a specific off-base organization (usually document identifier
   ISU, MSI, or DOR) for a single organization code (X373AA12341234) or all shipments to
   DRMS are having to be manually in-checked (no advanced information from SBSS), have
   base supply ensure the off-base indicator is set correctly. Documents with identifier TRM
   have to be manually input.
   10.14.2. Check the accuracy of the MILSTRIP shipments manually in-checked, without
   pre-positioned data from the SBSS in file. Any variance (e.g. FB instead of FE, transposed
   digits, system designator 01 instead of A1, etc.) between the supply document number and the
   system designator on the document and the input to CMOS will cause the SSC message to fail
   at the SBSS and the correct TCN may appear on both Part 5 and Part 6 of the R40 report.
   Ensure MILSTRIP shipments manually in-checked (without pre-positioned data) are
   assigned "Doc Type" of "M" at the "Shipment Planning Detail" window. CMOS does not
   produce data for the SBSS for any other "Doc Type.”
   10.14.3. Is the Management and Systems’ document control activity researching and
   correcting the rejects (type 260) from SSCs returned to the SBSS with erroneous (non-
   matching) system designators or document numbers?
      10.14.4. Check the inbound message log for messages with transmission mode of "ICI" and
      transmission status of "F" (failed). Review the associated priority message to determine the
      cause of the failure. Have these failures been reviewed with the local supply computer
      room personnel? Has the CMOS team at the SSG FAB (DSN 596-5771) been notified
      and/or has an SBSS discrepancy report been submitted?
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         107


   10.14.5. Release all shipments by close-of-business on the date shipped. Ensure every item in
   all consolidated shipments has been in-checked, linked to the lead TCN, and released in
   CMOS. The release action generates the communication messages for all CMOS
   interfaces, including the SBSS and is essential for ITV and accurate record keeping.
   10.14.6. Do items appear on the R40 even though the shipment was in-checked and/or
   shipped and released, prior to the date of the R40? If so, select three to five examples that
   were in-checked and/or shipped within the last 30 days. Ask the base supply Management
   and Systems’ document control activity supervisor to ensure that the SBSS shipment
   suspense record for each example still does not contain the in-checked or shipment
   information. Check the outbound message log and select the corresponding ICI message and
   delete the Transmission Status field. This will cause the message to be resent to the SBSS.
   Coordinate with the Management and Systems’ document control activity supervisor and
   obtain feedback as to when these messages (specific TCNs) are received and whether they
   loaded data correctly or rejected (failed). If they have not been received within a
   reasonable time, check the transmission status field and ensure it had changed back to a "P"
   (processed). Then ensure all ICI connections are up and talking to each other. If the
   Transmission Status field changed to an "F" (failed), refer to Paragraph 10.14.8 below.
   10.14.7. Are the CMOS R40 monitor, the SBSS computer room supervisor, and the
   Management and Systems’ document control activity supervisor working together to resolve
   problems?
   10.14.8. Are problems which are beyond local capabilities to fix elevated to the SSG Field
   Assistance Branch (DSN 596-5771) for resolution?
10.15. Tracing OCONUS DTS Shipments. Tracing can be accomplished through GTN,
Tracker, GATES, and other automated systems. For customers who do not have access to
automated means of tracing overseas shipments, contact the Air Force ACA/SSLO at Dover
AFB, DE, for east coast or Travis AFB CA for west coast by telephone, fax, or e-mail (see
DTR, Part II). The SSLO will trace shipment(s) by TCN and provide shipping status to the
requesting activity as follows:
   10.15.1. If no record is found, or if there is only a record of the ATCMD, the requester should
   go back to the originating point (shipper or supplier) for status.
   10.15.2. If there is a record of POE receipt, the SSLO will check with the POE Customer
   Service Branch for status and advise the requester.
   10.15.3. If there is a record of receipt and lift, the SSLO will advise the shipper.

             CLEARANCE OF AIR FORCE CARGO AND SHIPPER SERVICES

11.1. CONUS Distribution Management Cell (CDMC). The CDMC is the official
clearance agency for shipments planned for lift on military owned or controlled assets to
overseas points. It coordinates movement to the port of embarkation (POE) with both shippers
and project managers. The CDMC is responsible to maintain visibility over cleared cargo and
provides shipment status to tracer requests. In addition, the CDMC will work the POEs and
shippers to ensure advance movement data are at the ports prior to arrival of materiel.
Elements within the CDMC are the Air Force Airlift Clearance Authority (ACA) and the
Shipper Service Liaison Office (SSLO). The CDMC provides a flexible process to locate, divert,
expedite and/or provides visibility for any mission critical cargo. The CDMC operates from
a Command and Control Center at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, with additional personnel located
within the CONUS aerial ports. A myriad of asset visibility systems, commercial shippers, and
overseas ports will be used to perform its mission. The information gained will be used to meet
the customer needs for their cargo delivery. The data will also be used to focus on and
alleviate systematic conditions slowing the movement of cargo through the DTS and
commercial transportation system. To request the services of the CDMC go to website
https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/LG/LSO/lol/. Click on CDMC - CONUS
Distribution Management Cell
11.2. Theater Consolidation Shipping Point – Europe (TCSP-E). The TCSP-E is the
single theater focal point for timely management of sustainment cargo moving into theater and
transshipment of cargo to final predetermined destinations. The TCSP-E forecasts cargo arrival
through multiple Logistics Information Systems reports to make modal decisions prior to air
cargo arriving via AMC. Modal decisions take place at least 8 hours prior to cargo arrival,
providing an opportunity for TCSP-E to arrange both air and surface modes for onward
transportation to selected destinations within theater. Additionally, the TCSP-E provides a
flexible process to locate, divert, and expedite intra-theater cargo movement for selected
channels.
11.3. Air Force Eligibility and Challenge Procedures. The following Air Force airlift
eligibility and challenge procedures are effective 1 November 2004 and supersede previously
published version. Procedures for implementing current policy are specified in the following
paragraphs. For the most current information on airlift eligibility and challenge
procedures, visit the following website: https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-
AFMC/LG/LSO/lol/.

         11.3.1.3. AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Management
      11.3.2. Airlift Eligibility. Only TP-1 shipments with a valid Required Delivery Date (RDD) to
      include a blank RDD and TP-2 shipments with a valid RDD as shown below are airlift
      eligible. TP-3 is not eligible for air movement and will be automatically diverted to surface.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                             109


   However, certain medical and short shelf life items may be authorized to move by air as TP-3
   only if they have a valid RDD and/or project code. The following table illustrates the
   relationship between the RDD and TP for airlift eligible shipments.

   11.3.3. Challenge Criteria.
      11.3.3.1. RDD 999. The Air Force Airlift Clearance Authority (ACA) will challenge the
      following commodities of AF sponsored shipments with RDD 999. These commodities
      typically would not meet NMCS/MICAP requirements in accordance with Ref A thru D
      policy/procedures. When shipments are offered as RDD 999 with the following
      commodities, the requisitioner or shipper will be notified that the shipment is being
      challenged. Commanders will approve, or delegate in writing to specific personnel the
      authority to approve, all NMCS/MICAP requisitions in writing. The
      requisitioner/shipper will then need to provide this written approval by the
      appropriate authority to support assignment of RDD 999.
       B - Construction Materials
       D - Animals
       E - Engineer Supplies
       G - Printed Forms or Publications
       J – Unaccompanied Baggage

       Z – Human Remains
      11.3.3.2. The requisitioner/shipper has the option to substantiate air transport at the time
      of initial request to the ACA. The requisitioner/shipper should contact the ACA via
      email, fax, or phone with their justification for use of air to prevent delay due to
      challenge procedures on urgently required cargo. Shipments not justified to move as
      999 will be downgraded. The ACA will determine applicable priority and mode.
      11.3.3.3. If a shipment with any of the above commodities is released to the port as
      RDD 999 prior to advance clearance, the shipper service liaison office at the port will
      have the shipment frustrated until the challenged process is completed.
      11.3.3.4. Air Force funded Second Destination Transportation (SDT)/Central Managed
      Account (CMA) (TAC = F_ _ _) shipments assigned a TP-1 with any RDD other than 999
      or TP-2 with any RDD will be challenged when the shipment exceeds 250 pounds or 25
      cube.
      11.3.3.5. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) funded (TAC = S_ _ _) shipments assigned
      a TP-1 with any RDD other than 999 or TP-2 with any RDD will be challenged
      when the shipment exceeds 500 pounds or 50 cube.
      11.3.3.6. TP-2 shipments with blank RDD are not eligible for airlift and will
      automatically be diverted to surface.
      11.3.3.7. TP-3 shipments offered for airlift will automatically be diverted to surface
      movement, with the exception of short expiration date items (see Paragraph 2.4.2).
      However, TP-3 shipments may move as deferred air freight (TP-4) upon approval by Air
      Force ACA. Shipper must receive clearance from ACA prior to shipping to the port.
      11.3.3.8. JCS Project Code Cargo (9_ _ ). JCS project coded cargo is subject to ACA
      challenge/ hold action for purposes of controlling cargo flow in or out of the airlift system
      or to preclude misuse of project codes. Based on hold findings, the ACA will authorize
      (total or partial) airlift or can request shipment diversion to surface.
  11.3.4. Exemptions. TP-1 and TP-2 shipments with one of the characteristics listed below
  are all airlift eligible and exempt from challenge action and will continue to be cleared for
  airlift:
      11.3.4.1. Aircraft Engines.
      11.3.4.2. Foreign Military Sales (FMS): If the delivery term code (DTC), located at the
      fifth position of the TCN, is 6, 7, 9, A, D, F, G, or J.
      11.3.4.3. Shipments destined to FM5655 up to 1,500 pounds.
      11.3.4.4. Shipments with short expiration date (whole blood, perishable subsistence,
      biological, batteries, required refrigeration, radioactive, etc).
      11.3.4.5. AMC Support Shipments (TAC QMRS).
      11.3.4.6. TACs beginning with H, T and X
      11.3.4.7. Courier And Classified Shipments.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                       111


  11.3.5. Deferred Air Freight (TP-4). This allows non-air eligible cargo (TP-3 and excess
  weights/ cubes) to move at surface rates in uncommitted aircraft capacity. Air terminal
  managers in coordination with the ACA will determine the actual amount of TP-4 accepted
  into the aerial ports. Cargo must be cleared through the ACA as TP-4 prior to movement.
  11.3.6. Worldwide Express (WWX). Shipments less than 150 lbs which meet the WWX
  eligibility criteria and WWX carrier provides door-to-door service to final destination should
  move via WWX.

                        TRANSPORTATION PAYMENT PROCESSES

12.1. PowerTrack Payment Process. After the TO certifies the PowerTrack Monthly Billing
Statement (PSI), DFAS will reimburse the US Bank for cargo movement services. The PSI
enables DFAS to establish and liquidate the obligation for the shipper customer.
      12.1.1. Payment Process Flow. The commercial carrier payment business rules relate to ten
      primary functions in the payment process. They are:
         12.1.1.1. Shipment Booking
         12.1.1.2. Documentation. Documentation entered into CMOS is passed to
         USBank/PowerTrack. If CMOS is unavailable, Third Party Billing (TPB) transactions
         may be manually entered into PowerTrack by faxing CBLs to AFMC LSO/LOLB, DSN

         12.1.1.3. Status/Price Confirmation Generation
         12.1.1.4. Accounting Classification Review
         12.1.1.5. Carrier Payment Approval
         12.1.1.6. Carrier Payment

         12.1.1.10. Dispute Resolution
      12.1.2. Shipment Booking. The shipping TO will enter shipment data into the automated
      shipper system, either CMOS or Global Freight Management (GFM)/Electronic
      Transportation Acquisition (ETA). If CMOS/GFM-ETA is unavailable, and CBLs are
      created manually, the data will be entered into PowerTrack direct. If assistance is needed
      with manually entering data into PowerTrack, please contact the PowerTrack Help Desk at
      1-800-417-1844.
         12.1.2.1. PowerTrack will use the DODAAC or BLOC as the sort key for routing CBL
         data to the origin TO's PowerTrack account. The automated shipping systems will
         assign the proper sort code; GFM-ETA uses the DODAAC and CMOS uses BLOC.
         When a site initiates PowerTrack, it must identify which automated shipping system is
         being used. If the wrong identifier is used, the shipment will not be assigned to the
         correct PowerTrack account. If a carrier's proprietary system is used to create the CBL or
         Air Waybill, this information will be input into PowerTrack direct.
         12.1.2.2. PowerTrack will use the SCAC to identify the carrier moving the shipment.
         12.1.2.3. TOs will not accept a shipment without a LOA and an obligation document
         number/ SDN supplied by the shipper. The LOA/SDN will be entered on each shipment
         with a TCN. The TO must ensure there is either a TAC or LOA and SDN on each CBL.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          113


     12.1.2.4. CMOS will auto-populate "US Bank PowerTrack" in the “Bill To:” field to
     identify PowerTrack shipments. If any other entry is entered into the “Bill To” field,
     the CBL will not appear in PowerTrack. CMOS users must ensure that the MRM 15
     indicator is checked on their commercial carrier data screen. This will generate “US
     Bank” in the “Bill To” field.
  12.1.3. Documentation. The TO will print a minimum of two hard copies of the CBL. One
  copy will be given to the carrier and one copy will be retained for file. Additional copies
  may be needed if required by MAJCOM or local procedures.
     12.1.3.1. The TO will provide a paper CBL/manifest to the carrier at pickup. Release all
     shipment information from CMOS to PowerTrack no later than close-of-business on the
     date shipped. This will release the electronic CBL data to PowerTrack.
  12.1.4. Status/Price Confirmation Generation. The carrier will submit delivery status to
  PowerTrack via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) 214 transaction set, the PowerTrack web
  interface or by telephone. If the carrier submits price data to PowerTrack, it will be via EDI
  110/210 transaction sets. The carrier will perform services according to the shipping
  instructions as specified in the CBL and applicable contracts and tenders. The carrier must
  provide notification of delivery of the shipment to PowerTrack before the payment can be
  made. Transportation Offices will track all CBLs issued, and follow-up with carriers on
  shipments that do not have a notice of delivery within a reasonable time-frame.
     12.1.4.1. Locally paid services and/or accessorial charge. If the shipment incurs locally
     paid services or accessorial charges, the carrier will bill the origin TO by creating an eBill
     in PowerTrack that will be linked to the original CBL. Carriers will create eBills for any
     charges not included in the original billing transaction. The eBill will cause the CBL to
     appear in audit exception in PowerTrack. The destination TO must notify the origin TO
     of any additional charges associated with the CBL. If the charges are to be paid by
     destination, the destination TO must provide an LOA/ SDN to the origin TO. The origin
     TO will approve the eBill for payment and input the applicable LOA/SDN. Anytime an
     eBill is created, the “notes” feature of PowerTrack must be annotated with the rationale for
     eBill payment. This is a DOD IG requirement and no exceptions are permitted.
  12.1.5. Accounting Classification Review. At any time during the billing cycle, the individual
  responsible for a local O&M transportation account (can be designated as the Funds
  Manager for that account) and the Accounting Liaison Office will coordinate and review
  the Statement Preview or Expense Distribution in PowerTrack to confirm the proper use of
  the LOA they manage. If it is determined that a change in the LOA needs to be made, the
  individual will coordinate the change with the PowerTrack POC in the TMF. Any errors or
  changes referred to the TO will be corrected and documented in the PowerTrack note
  function. Any changes must be handled promptly, and should not exceed three GBDs.
     12.1.5.1. If an invalid LOA/TAC is identified, the TO will check with the shipment
     originator to obtain a valid LOA/SDN or TAC. Again, all changes must be
     accomplished within three GBDs and rationale for the change annotated in the PT notes
     function.
  12.1.6. Carrier Payment Approval Requirements. TOs will assign each individual
  PowerTrack user, within an office, a maximum dollar amount for carrier payment approval.
114                                         AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


   If the CBL price on a shipment exceeds a user’s maximum approval limit that user will not
   be able to approve carrier payment. Ensure primary and alternate individuals are designated
   for various thresholds. In rare instances when a transaction exceeds all local approval
   levels, contact AFMC LSO/LOLB for assistance. The approval level can be temporarily
   increased, or an LSO representative can make the approval on behalf of the shipper.
   These actions must also be annotated within the notes feature for that transaction. For audit
   processes, the TO should randomly validate notice of delivery by contacting the destination
   TO. If discrepancies are discovered, both origin and destination TOs should take
   appropriate action against the carrier.
      12.1.6.1. The TO will approve payment for the amount determined as the government’s
      responsibility to pay. The amount the government is responsible to pay includes the rate
      for the shipment and any authorized accessorial charges as specified in the contract.
      12.1.6.2. The carrier payment process cannot begin until there is confirmation in
      PowerTrack that services have been performed. The confirmation of performed services
      will be the receipt of the carrier’s notification of delivery. Actual carrier payment will be
      based on services provided under the CBL. The approving official will launch the
      PowerTrack Transaction Manager function daily, review transaction status, and approve,
      deny, or place on hold all shipments with a delivery notification status. The notes
      function must be used to substantiate placing a transaction in “hold”, or “denied” status
      so the carrier is aware of the circumstances and can attempt to remedy the issue.
      12.1.6.3. Automatic Approval of Payment. In the government and carrier invoice
      models, maximum automatic approval price thresholds have been established in
      PowerTrack. TOs may request to change this price threshold based upon workload and
      carrier characteristics. Requests will be routed through MAJCOM for approval before
      submission to AFMC LSO/LOLB.
          12.1.6.3.1. Shipments meeting the automatic approval price, threshold and tolerance
          parameters will be approved for payment without the TO review on-line.
          12.1.6.3.2. TOs will review all shipments that were automatically approved for
          payment. If payment for a late shipment was automatically approved, the TO will
          submit an eBill to request an appropriate adjustment in price, accompanied by a note
          detailing the reason for the reimbursement request.
      12.1.6.4. Manual Approval of Payment. Any transactions that are not automatically
      approved must be approved manually. Wherever possible, a separation of duties should
      be maintained and the person who approves carrier payment should be different from
      the person who created the CBL. For shipments that do not meet the auto approval
      criteria, the TO must take one of the following actions within three GBDs after
      notification of delivery:
          12.1.6.4.1. Approve the payment.
          12.1.6.4.2. Adjust the price and record the reason for the adjustment in a PowerTrack
          note.
          12.1.6.4.3. Place on hold and request additional information from carrier.
          12.1.6.4.4. Deny payment and record reason in a PowerTrack note.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         115


     12.1.6.5. The TO must approve for payment, the amount they determine the
     government is responsible to pay. Differences between this price and the originally
     tendered estimate (if higher) will be resolved in an eBill. Adjustments in the original
     payment estimate must be documented in the PowerTrack note function, for the purposes
     of invoice certification and post payment examination.
         12.1.6.5.1. Once a response from a carrier is received on a shipment placed in hold,
         the TO that placed the hold has three GBDs to approve or deny.
     12.1.6.6. The TO can update a transaction in PowerTrack before US Bank remits
     payment to the carrier. In those situations where transactions are updated, the TO
     approving the change must attach a note to the transaction in PowerTrack explaining
     why the change was made. The following rules apply when updating shipment data prior
     to remitting payment to the carrier:
         12.1.6.6.1. All changes affecting cost must be recorded in PowerTrack either
         directly in the form as a note, or as an update from the shipper system.
         12.1.6.6.2. If a shipment is delivered after the RDD, and the price paid is contingent
         on timely delivery, the TO will adjust the price in PowerTrack prior to approval and
         record the reason in a PowerTrack Note. The price adjustment will be determined by
         the terms of the contract or tender.
     12.1.6.7. After US Bank has paid the carrier, any changes to price or shipment data
     must be entered into PowerTrack via the eBill process and annotated in the transaction
     notes.
     12.1.6.8. Collect Shipments. For a collect shipment to be entered into PowerTrack, the
     customer must obtain the LOA/SDN from the destination prior to bringing to the origin
     TO for shipment. After notice of delivery and approval for payment to the carrier, origin
     TO will notify the destination of the actual shipping charges paid.
  12.1.7. Carrier Payment. US Bank will not pay the carrier until notification of delivery
  and TO approval is received. US Bank will pay the carrier after the TO approves the
  transaction for payment, removes a transaction from hold status or resolves an eBill. The
  carrier payment approval process (referenced in paragraph 12.3) outlines the action the TO
  will use to approve transactions.
  12.1.8. Accounting. Individuals responsible for LOAs or AF Forms 616 will manually adjust
  or post obligations utilizing the information available in PowerTrack (i.e., if the local TO is
  managing an AF Form 616 for a unit assigned to origin, each shipment cost will be annotated
  on the AF Form 616 after payment to the carrier). Once the process becomes fully automated,
  PowerTrack will send obligations and accruals direct to DFAS.
  12.1.9. PowerTrack Summary Invoice (PSI). Procedures for the Prompt Payment Act
  apply. The responsibilities for certifying officers, accountable officials, and reviewing
  officials are contained in DOD 7000.14, DoD Financial Management Regulation
  (DoDFMR), Volume 5, Chapter 33, Accountable Officials and Certifying Officers (see
  Paragraph       3307       for      information        regarding     pecuniary       liability):
  http://www.defenselink.mil/comptroller/fmr/05/05_33.pdf. The LRS/CC is designated
  the appointing authority for the Certifying Official. The appointment must be in writing and a
116                                         AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


   copy of the appointment letter, along with the DD Form 577, Signature Card, must be on
   file with the servicing DFAS OPLOC. Recommend that the individual appointed as
   Certifying Officer complete the DFAS Certifying Officer Course to obtain a complete
   understanding of responsibilities. Contact the DFAS representative at 703-607-5112 or your
   local Financial Services Office (FSO) to obtain information on training courses.
      12.1.9.1. The Certifying Officer will print the PSI two GBDs after the 15th of the month
      or within two GBDs following the date when US Bank generates the PSI, whichever
      occurs later. The Certifying Officer will annotate the availability date on the PSI (i.e.,
      date stamp the PSI). The PSI must be accessed through the PowerTrack website and
      printed out. No hard copy will be mailed to the Certifying Officer.
      12.1.9.2. The Certifying Officer will utilize the Statement Preview to start researching
      PSI entries in advance to speed up the certification process and to identify any
      transactions which do not belong (i.e., “foreign transactions”). Any such discrepancies
      noted must be immediately reported to the PowerTrack Customer Operations Desk for
      investigation and resolution. The Funds Manager report can be accessed daily to review
      shipments that have been paid in Power-Track.
      12.1.9.3. The Certifying Officer will review the PSI from US Bank to ensure that it
      reflects the actual carrier payments.
      12.1.9.4. The Certifying Officer certifies the PSI as correct and proper for payment using
      the following statement: “I certify the charges on this statement are true and accurate to
      the best of my knowledge.” After signing the PSI, and coordinating through the local
      FSO, send the PSI to the DFAS payment center designated for that TO.
      12.1.9.5. The Certifying Officer must certify the PSI and forward it, along with the
      Line Level Detail to the designated DFAS payment center by the 5th GBD following the
      date the PSI is available. This is to ensure the DFAS payment center has sufficient time to
      prevalidate and make payment to US Bank to meet Prompt Payment Act requirements.
      The Line Level Detail for the same time period must be attached to the PSI. Accounts will
      be suspended if delinquent greater than 105 days. Upon suspension, USBank will not pay
      any additional payments to carriers until the delinquency is resolved. Even though the
      shipper may approve payment to the carrier, the payment will not be generated and will
      remain in an “approval final” status vice going to a “payment initiated” status. In
      addition, delinquent accounts generate interest charges to USBank which are funded by
      the shipping base O & M accounts.
      12.1.9.5. (AFSPC) TO will check the AFMC website and review the monthly Power
      Track account status, if any invoices for your location are outstanding, provide status
      within 10 days of the posting to AFSPC/A4R.
          12.1.9.5.1. ANG. The Certifying Officer must certify the PSI and forward it, along
          with the Line Level Detail, to the local FM, by the 5th GBD following the date the
          PSI is available. This is to ensure the FM office has sufficient time to prevalidate
          and make payments to US Bank to meet Prompt Payment Act requirements. The
          Line Level Detail for the same time period must be attached to the PSI.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          117


   12.1.10. Bank Payment. The US Bank’s PSI charges will be summarized by a LOA. The PSI
   will not include SDN level of detail. The Line Level Detail will provide the SDN level detail.
   Additional supporting detail is available in PowerTrack via multiple reporting tools.
       12.1.10.1. If the DFAS payment office receives a certified PSI with a LOA that fails
       edit in the entitlement system because of insufficient funds available, DFAS will
       increase the obligation to the billed value. If the LOA fails the edit because no funds are
       available, DFAS will either establish an obligation, or will debit the service’s alternate
       LOA. If LOA fails the edit because of validity, DFAS will attempt to identify the
       correct LOA by contacting the originating TO. The originating TO will have two
       GBDs to provide a corrected LOA. If unsuccessful, DFAS will assign the service’s
       alternate LOA for billed value and notify the HQ POC for the alternate LOA. The DFAS
       payment office will notify the HQ POC of any obligation increase, the establishment of
       any obligation, or the use of the alternate LOA. DFAS will then process the payment to
       US Bank.
          12.1.10.1.1. ANG. If the ANG FM receives a certified PSI with an LOA that fails
          edit in the entitlement system because of insufficient funds, FM will increase the
          obligation to the billed value. If the LOA fails the edit because of no funds available,
          the FM will either establish an obligation, or will debit the service’s alternate LOA. If
          the LOA fails the edit because of validity, FM will attempt to identify the correct
          LOA by contacting the disbursing office that provided the prevalidation. The
          disbursing office will have two GBDs to provide a corrected LOA. If
          unsuccessful, FM will assign the service’s alternate LOA for billed value and notify
          the HQ POC for alternate LOA. The FM office will notify the HQ POC of any
          obligation increase, the establishment of any obligation, or the use of the alternate
          LOA. FM will then process the payment to US bank.
12.2. Dispute Resolution. The following guidelines will be followed regarding the creation of
eBills for resolving under/over-payments:
   12.2.1. The carrier always has the option to go through the appropriate SDDC office to
   request a price adjustment. However, a billing dispute must first go through the eBill
   process before requesting a price adjustment from SDDC.
   12.2.2. Either the TO or the carrier can submit an eBill. After the eBill is submitted to
   PowerTrack, the other party will have three GBDs after receipt to reply. After receiving an
   eBill from the carrier the TO will either: approve payment, deny payment, or hold payment.
   The notes function will be used to document any action necessary to resolve the transaction
   from a “hold” or “denied” status.
   12.2.3. The carrier must take one of the following actions within three GBDs of receiving
   an eBill from the TO: approve for credit, deny credit, or hold credit. The notes function will
   be used to document any action necessary to resolve the transaction from a “hold” or
   “denied” status.
   12.2.4. When the TO or carrier creates an eBill, they will reference the CBL number, or the
   user will append sequential letters to the CBL number for each eBill created.
   12.2.5. Price disputes that cannot be resolved between the TO and the carrier after 60 days
   will be forwarded to SDDC.
118                                          AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


12.3. Third Party Billing (TPB). TPB procedures apply to authorized TPB certified carriers as
directed by HQ USAF/A4RM. TOs must use TPB when the shipment is funded with an AFWCF
or specific SDT/ CMA TAC. In addition to the following, AFMC LSO/LOL has provided
detailed TPB and TAC information in the FY Memorandums and on the AFMC LSO/ LOL
website:    https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/LG/LSO/lol/.               Under     TPB,
PowerTrack is the commercial carrier payment process allowing US Bank to pay the carrier upon
notice of delivery. In turn, US Bank is reimbursed by the Defense Finance and Accounting
Service (DFAS) after the TO certifies the PowerTrack Summary Invoice (PSI). This commercial
payment process is applicable to carriers, brokers, and third party logistics providers. Refer to
Paragraph 12.1 for PowerTrack procedures.
   12.3.1. All valid AFWCF and SDT/CMA TACs are authorized in TPB. Updates will be
   provided by message. The AFMC LSO/LOL website links to the Master TAC Reference
   Table that shows all valid TACs and their proper usage.
      12.3.2. Do not co-mingle AFWCF and SDT/CMA TACs with LOAs on the same Bill of
      Lading (BOL). EXCEPTION: AMC CONUS aerial ports are authorized to co-mingle TACs
      and LOAs when moving OCONUS-inbound cargo to final destinations.
      12.3.3. The Industry Information Processor (I2P) is not required to accomplish TPB.
      Manual entries may be made directly into PowerTrack although it is highly recommended
      that CMOS is utilized to enter shipper data.
      12.3.4. AFMC LSO/LOL will certify all TPB invoices for payment processing. See
      Paragraph 3.5 for exception.
12.4. Use of Government-wide Purchase Card (GPC) for DESPS shipments. The GPC may
be used to pay for use of the DESPS BPA. Cardholders must coordinate with their TO prior
to setting up an account. The TO will provide advice to cardholders when requested. If the
purchase card is used without first setting up an account, units will be billed at the much higher
commercial rate. Ref: AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-Wide Purchase Card (GPC)
Program. See Paragraph 1.6.6
   12.4.1. Contractor Reference Guide. TOs must ensure they obtain a copy of the DESPS
   carrier(s) reference guide that provides added guidance. Additional information is
   available at AMC website: https://amclg.scott.af.mil/don/domexpress/spsindex.html.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          119


                                            Chapter 13

                                 CONTRACTOR SUPPORT

13.1. Transportation and Traffic Management Guidance. Transportation and traffic
management guidance pertaining to contract support is in numerous DOD, Joint Service, Air
Force instructions, manuals, and civilian agency directives. TOs provide transportation and
traffic management support to contracting as contained in these publications, to include cargo
movement support to government contractors, when designated. The most used publications are
listed below:
   13.1.1. DOD 4500.9-R, DTR, Part II.
   13.1.2. AFMAN 24-204(I)
   13.1.3. Title 49, CFR, Transportation.
   13.1.4. AFMAN 16-101, International Affairs and Security Assistance Management.
   13.1.5. FAR, Particularly Parts 42, 47, and 52.
   13.1.6. DOD FAR Supplement.
   13.1.7. Air Force FAR Supplement.
13.2. Traffic Management Support. TOs provide advice to the contracting officer to include
appropriate traffic management and logistics contract language. They also evaluate prospective
contractor offers to assist the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) in obtaining the most
economical and responsive transportation service for the Air Force customer. It is essential
that liaison is established between the two offices to produce the best possible contractual
instrument, clearly defining packaging and transportation mode/method, documentation and
payment.
13.3. Assistance to Contracting. The transportation advisor to contracting must exercise
judgment and technical skill in providing advice that will result in transportation terms in the
contract or purchase order that are most advantageous to the government.
   13.3.1. As a minimum, the TO considers the following factors when providing
   transportation advice to the PCO:
       13.3.1.1. Free on Board (FOB) terms.
       13.3.1.2. Specific Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses and/or relevant DOD,
       Air Force and MAJCOM supplement clauses. The requirement to obtain airlift or
       surface clearance for export shipments moving via the DTS must be included in any
       contract involving international shipments.
       13.3.1.3. Identification of correct transportation funds to pay for movement.
       13.3.1.4. Detailed identification of the required "ship to" and "mark for" addresses.
   13.3.2. Use the detailed shipping instructions in Paragraph 13.5 when using "FOB Origin-
   Contractor Prepaid." Paragraph 13.5 only applies when the base contracting office
   administers the contract. Paragraph 13.5 does not apply to contracts administered by the
   Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA).
120                                          AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


   13.3.3. The MAJCOM/base financing procurement of assets with O&M funds on a FOB
   origin basis must fund the first destination transportation with its O&M-type funds.
   13.3.4. TOs advise the PCO to consider delegating, where applicable, transportation,
   packaging and quality control responsibilities to DCMA when a contract is awarded. NOTE:
   DCMA MUST HAVE CONTRACTS DELEGATED TO THEM TO PROVIDE THIS
   ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT. See Paragraph 13.7 for AF Form 9, Request for Purchase,
   procedures.
13.4. Depot-level Reparable Shipments. For AFWCF depot-level reparable shipments,
door-to-door commercial express carrier movement should be contracted/arranged with the
contractor source as part of the process. This supports Agile Logistics principles.
13.5. Contractor Prepaid Shipping Instructions. The TO may include the following 3
paragraphs verbatim into shipping instructions of contractual instruments when FOB Origin
contractor prepaid transportation is contemplated. Methods of shipping include USPS, other
commercial small package carriers or any other carrier authorized use of commercial forms and

upon initial assignment and whenever there is a change in equipment, procedures, processes or
safety, fire protection, and health requirements. Well-trained and educated personnel are the
greatest deterrent to mishaps in the workplace. Supervisor’s document safety-related training on
AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, or other form/automated system approved by
the Chief, Ground Safety, IAW AFI 91-301.
17.5. Safety Inspections. Accomplish hazard assessment and identification through the
application of occupational safety, fire prevention, and health inspections, evaluations, and
surveys. Supervisors perform self-inspections to assess the safety environment of the unit. Most
AFOSH standards contain sample checklists for unit self-inspections. Also, use locally developed
checklists tailored to specific unit requirements. Wing or base-level safety, bioenvironmental
engineering, fire protection, and environmental inspectors conduct unit inspections,
evaluations, and surveys according to AFI 91-301 and AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials
Management.
   17.5.1. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) officials, as
   representatives of the Secretary of Labor may conduct inspections of nonmilitary-unique
   workplaces and operations where Air Force civilian personnel work. (The inspections may
   be unannounced). OSHA inspectors may question or privately interview any employee,
   supervisory employee, or official in charge of an operation or workplace.
   17.5.2. Federal OSHA officials may perform OSH inspections of Air Force workplaces
   in areas where the US holds exclusive federal jurisdiction (including government owned
   contractor operated facilities).
   17.5.3. State OSHA officials, operating under a federally approved plan and subject to the
   terms of any variance, tolerance, or exemption granted by the Department of Labor, may
   enforce state OSHA standards in contractor workplaces. At overseas locations, local
   government agencies may conduct inspections of contractor facilities or operations as
   stipulated in the status of forces or country-to-country agreement IAW AFI 91-301.
17.6. General Safety Guidance. Packaging and preservation personnel are exposed to a large
variety of hazardous situations, machinery, equipment, and chemicals. Most hazardous situations
can be avoided by simply following procedures, asking for help when needed, and using
personal protective equipment (PPE). Supervisors must be knowledgeable of the AFOSH
Standards, TOs, and AF instructions applicable to their operations and ensure their personnel are
educated on the safety requirements applicable to the job. Personnel work more safely and
effectively when properly trained and motivated. For example, ensure personnel who work
with hazardous chemical are trained as outlined in AFOSH-STD-91-501 on personal protective
equipment.
   17.6.1. Use the general work center safety guidance in AFOSH-STD 91-66, General
   Industrial Operations, and local instructions. Follow AFOSH-STD-91-66 for safe practices
   in operation and maintenance of base facilities, such as, buildings and grounds, general
   housekeeping, ladders, office safety practices, emergency eyewash and showers, and finger
   ring policies. It also addresses safety precautions for electrical facilities and electronic
   equipment, such as, electrical emergency equipment, protective equipment, fire prevention,
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), first aid training, clothing and jewelry. It also
   contains guidance for tool safety, material handling, fall protection, housekeeping, and
   operation and maintenance of compressed air systems.

17.7. Work Safety Guidance. Follow safety guidance found in AFOSH-STD-91-66 and
equipment TOs. AFOSH-STD-91-66 contains safety guidance for general housekeeping and
office safety principles. See Attachment 1 for AFOSH standards applicable to packaging and
preservation activities.
      17.7.1. Adhere to AFOSH-STD-91-501 for requirements on safe operation, inspection and
      maintenance of industrial machinery. Packaging and preservation personnel must inspect
      equipment prior to use. Supervisors are required to instruct machine operators on the proper
      use, inspection, maintenance and documentation requirements. Industrial machines will be
      scheduled for preventive maintenance (inspection and minor maintenance) on a weekly
      basis, the AFTO Form 244, Industrial/Support Equipment Record, will be used to
      document inspection and maintenance action requirements and accomplishments.
      Documentation will be accomplished using T.O. 34-1-3, Machinery and Shop Equipment.
17.8. Flight Line Driving. Motor vehicles operating on the flight line present a clear and
possible danger to aircraft, equipment, and ground personnel. Guard against carelessness, haste,
and disregard of safety standards. These factors are the primary sources of collisions and
personnel injury. All operators of vehicles on the flightline must first obtain training and
possess a valid flightline driving permit. Follow the general safety requirements for flight line
vehicle operations found in AFOSH-STD 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line Ground Operations and
Activities and AFJMAN 24-306, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Driver, AFI 13-213, Airfield
Management and Base Operations, and local instructions. Familiarize all personnel authorized
to operate vehicles on the flight line with the aircraft marshaling signals found in AFI 11-218,
Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground.
17.9. Warehouse Entry/Exit. Driving in and out of warehouses, the basic rule is to blow
horn upon entering and exiting building. While driving a forklift, the tines should be 4-6 inches
above ground. When driving MHE 10K or larger, the use of a spotter is mandatory. This also
applies when operating 4K or 6K forklifts carrying oversize bulk items, as referenced in
paragraph 17.6 above.
17.10. AFOSH Guidance. Use AFOSH standards where federal standards either do not
exist, do not adequately cover a function, contain less stringent criteria, or when consolidation
of information is beneficial for use in the workplace. Use Air Force functional directives and
technical data in conjunction with AFOSH standards. If conflicting guidance exists, the weapon
system specific technical data will take precedence. See Attachment 1 for AFOSH standards
applicable to packaging and preservation activities.
17.11. Hazardous Energy Control (Lockout and Tagout). Use of procedures to isolate
machinery or equipment (in off-equipment areas) from all potentially hazardous energy shall
be implemented IAW AFOSH-STD 91-501. When the unexpected energizing, startup, or
release of stored energy could cause injury, machinery or equipment is locked out or tagged out
before qualified personnel perform any servicing or maintenance. Instruct all personnel in the
safety significance of lockout or tagout procedures. Additional guidance for instituting an
effective program for Hazardous Energy Control (Lockout and Tagout) and Mishap Prevention
Signs and Tags is found in AFOSH-STD 91-501, Chapter 21.
17.12. Safety Equipment. Hazards should be engineered out, isolated, guarded against or a
safer chemical used as a substitute whenever possible before considering the use of personal
protective equipment (PPE). PPE devices alone should not be relied on to provide protection
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        133


against hazards, but should be used in conjunction with guards, engineering or administrative
controls. When PPE is required, ensure personnel are provide the appropriate PPE for the
hazard and are trained in its use, inspection and care. Contact the installation ground safety or
bioenvironmental engineering staff for assistance in the selection of PPE. Review AFOSH-STD-
91-501 for additional information on personal protective equipment.

                                          Chapter 18

                AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY (AIT)

18.1. Introduction. Automated Identification Technology (AIT) is the proper mix of
technology that allows each user to efficiently and effectively capture, aggregate, and transfer
data and information, and as a consequence, integrate with automated information systems (AISs)
using the optimum technology for their particular application. AIT will facilitate data collection
and flow to all AISs to better achieve Total Asset Visibility (TAV) enhance and streamline
business processes and warfighting capability.
18.2. Primary AIT. Primary AIT used in the Defense Transportation System (DTS) are bar
code labels (both linear and 2-dimensional) and active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID).
Passive RFID is an emerging capability in the USAF. It will be incorporated into shipment
process, primarily on a pilot project basis, starting in FY06. AIT is used to capture and report
data to CMOS to support additional processing.
18.3. Bar Coding. Bar Coding (Bar Code Symbol) is a graphic representation of numeric or
alphanumeric data in the form of variable width bars and spaces. The general format of a bar code
symbol consists of a leading margin, start character, data or message characters, check character
(if any), stop character, and trailing margin. Bar codes are read by an optical scanning device,
such as a laser, then translated (decoded) and transferred to a Host computer for subsequent
data manipulation. Using bar code is one method of providing fast, virtually error-free data
input. The use of “multi-row”, “stacked” or “two dimensional” bar codes allows the
encoding of more information in a smaller space than with conventional, single-row bar codes.
   18.3.1. Transportation activities use bar coded DD 1348-1 and Military Shipment Labels to
   facilitate cargo receipt and processing.
       18.3.1.1. Bar coding on the 1348-1A can be used to receive cargo from supply and to
       build consolidated shipments. If pre-positioned data has not been provided from SBSS,
       the bar coded information can be used to initiate creation of an inbound record.
       18.3.1.2. Bar coded military shipping labels are the AIT backbones of the DTS. They are
       used at destination for receipt and at in-transit locations for receipt and processing. At
       in-transit points, 2-D TCMD data can be used to populate missing data in WPS, GATES
       or CMOS.
       18.3.1.3. Traffic management offices will maintain the capability to produce and read
       bar coded 1348-1As and MSLs.
           18.3.1.3.1. Maintain sufficient bar code capable printers to support MSL production.
           During 2006, RFID-enabled printers will be deployed at several of the Air Force
           base shipping locations. The deployment of the RFID-enabled printers will be
           phased to these Air Force locations based on the current volume of shipments
           generated from the Air Force Locations. The Air Force will apply RF MSLs to all
           palletized cargo.
           18.3.1.3.2. Maintain hand held terminal and/or wedge readers to support in-check
           processes. The CMOS-Radio Frequency (RF) system incorporates RF transfers
           between Handheld Terminals (HHTs) and the host database. CMOS uses RF HHTs to
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          135


           in-check in-bound, out-bound, packing and crating, consolidation, and piece data. No
           more HHTs uploading and downloading from the PC. Information is relayed onto
           the HHTs in real time. The installation of bar code scanners enabled personnel to
           scan the bar codes, rather than keypunch the data into CMOS.
18.4. Active RFID (aRFID). Active RFID uses an internal power source (battery) within the
tag to continuously power the tag and it RF communication circuitry. Active RFID allows very
low-level signals to be received by the tag (because the reader does not need to answer the
tag), and the tag can generate high-level signals back to the reader, driven from its internal
power source. Additionally, the Active RFID tag is continuously powered, whether in the reader
field or not. Active RFID readers (interrogators) generally operate at the .3 mill-watt power
level, and can provide communication ranges of 100 meters or more. Active RFID operating
at 433.92 MHz is almost universally applicable over the globe and has approvals. Active
RFID is a proven tool for providing inside-the-box, in-transit visibility of contents in containers
and pallets and it has mitigated some of the cost experienced during current deployment
operations. The infrastructure to support deployment operations has begun fielding.
   18.4.1. OSD policy requires origin to prepare aRFID for certain shipments moving to, from,
   or between OCONUS locations. Under normal circumstances, USAF traffic managers will
   tag sustainment 463L pallets, 20/40 containers, and vehicles that meet the criteria. Regional
   Combatant Commands may establish requirements above those identified in OSD policy and
   this paragraph. Traffic managers will comply with the additional requirements when
   disseminated by HQ USAF. Unit move tagging requirements are covered in the Under
   Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (USD) (AT&L) Memo of 30
   July 2004, Subject: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Policy for both active and passive
   RFID: http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/rfid/Policy/RFID%20Policy%2007-30-2004.pdf.
   18.4.2. Traffic management offices will maintain aRFID read/write capability at their
   location to support both sustainment and unit deployment requirements. CMOS will be used
   to write RFID tags for sustainment/retrograde and unit move shipments. In addition, TOs
   will maintain sufficient tags on hand to support sustainment and unit move cargo
   (deployment and redeployment).
       18.4.2.1. Register read station(s), maintain docking station(s) and/or wireless write
       capability. Bases will maintain sufficient RFID tag docking stations to support
       sustainment and unit deployment. The docking stations will be Cargo Movement
       Operations System (CMOS) peripherals. Bases will support installation and
       maintenance of fixed RFID interrogators. The interrogator (s) will be positioned to read
       tags for cargo arriving/departing the installation via military airlift and or/via
       military/commercial trucks. RFID write stations and interrogators will be procured
       through the Air Force AIT Program Management Office. Purchase of RFID tag docking
       stations will be coordinated through HQ OSSG/ILR, Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex, AL,
       to assure compatibility with CMOS. Bases/MAJCOMs will be responsible for
       maintenance and replacement of RFID hardware.
       18.4.2.2. Set up, register and maintain fixed and/or portable reader capability. Mobile
       and handheld readers must be available to facilitate the automatic identification of tagged
       materials by both material custodians and operational forces. Fixed, mobile and handheld
       readers, and the supporting communications and computers and database capability,
136                                          AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


       must be available in order to ensure that data on the tags can be readily acquired and
       interpreted by any authorized person, anywhere, and at any time the operational need
       arises.
       18.4.2.3. Maintain tags and batteries. Replace batteries on received, stored and transiting
       tags as required. Activities will maintain an adequate stock of active RFID tags to support
       unit move and sustainment cargo movement requirements. Bases will also maintain a
       stock of 3.6 Volt AA Lithium replacement batteries. These are ordered from Defense
       Supply Center Richmond (DSCR), ICP Routing Identifier Code S9G. The NSN is 6135-
       01-301-8776. (Note: Lithium ion batteries, in large quantities, are considered hazardous
       items for air movement. However, the batteries used in the Savi RFID tags have been
       determined to be non-regulated and can be moved via air transport as long as they are
       separated to prevent movement and short circuit and packed in strong packaging with
       less than 12 batteries per package. The batteries are not regulated when installed in Savi
       tags battery compartment.
   18.4.3. As bases receive tags on inbound pallets, containers, etc; they will (1) induct tags
   into base inventory, (2) return them to the nearest aerial port or (3) return them to DLA. If
   the inbound tags are from a deploying unit, every effort will be made to retain those tags and
   apply them to the same unit’s retrograde cargo. The tags will be maintained and stored by
   the deployed traffic management function. USAF base level activities will assure
   procedures are in place for recovery and reutilization of active RFID tags.
18.5. Passive RFID (pRFID). Passive RFID relies on RF energy transferred from the reader to
the tag to power the tag. Passive RFID operation requires very strong signals from the
reader, and the signal strength returned from the tag is constrained to very low levels by the
limited energy. Passive RFID readers operate at the 1-5 mill-watt power range. Power and
frequency determine the read and write range of the signal and must have appropriate
certification. Passive RFID will operate in a range from 860-960 MHz in order to have global
application.
   18.5.1. OSD policy is driving increased use of pRFID. Current DoD RFID policy requires
   the lowest level of passive RF tagging at the case level. However, this technology is still
   maturing. USAF conducted a pilot project demonstrating use of pRFID enabled MSLs. The
   Passive Radio Frequency Identification Military Shipping Label (RFMSL) Initial
   Capability project encompasses passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) insertion
   into the current transportation business processes of the U.S. Air Force (USAF), U.S.
   Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and U.S.
   Army. Systems with which the project interfaces are Cargo Movement Operations System
   (CMOS), Distribution Standard System (DSS), Global Air Transportation Execution
   System (GATES), and Defense Automatic Addressing System (DAAS), and the Radio
   Frequency In-Transit Visibility (RF-ITV) sever.
   18.5.2. The introduction of EPC Passive RFID will require the use of Advanced Shipping
   Notices (ASN) in 856 formats. Without the ASN, the system does not know how many tag
   reads to look for in order to successfully determine if all material arriving at destination is
   accounted. Once passive RFID is fielded, it is anticipated that the ASN requirement will be an
   integrated part of the logistics information flow and may reduce the overall logistics
   communications requirement.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         137


  18.5.3. Passive RFID implementation will require significant training to assure proper use
  throughout the Department. Lack of training will impact proper implementation and
  utilization of the technology. There is risk that there will be insufficient training to support
  effective implementation.

 COUNTER-CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR HIGH
 YIELD EXPLOSIVES (CBRNE) REQUIREMENTS, TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND
       PROCEDURES FOR IDENTIFYING, MARKING, AND MANAGING
                CONTAMINATED CARGO SHIPMENTS

20.1. General Information. This chapter contains the procedures for identification, marking,
and maintenance of cargo shipments contaminated during hostilities or contingencies. Cargo
shipments may be contaminated by any number of means, whether chemical, biological,
radiological, or nuclear. Contamination by chemical means is considered the primary threat to
cargo shipments. During a conflict or contingency, minimize the potential for cargo
contamination, while continuing to support the mission. If cargo shipments become
contaminated, the shipments must be decontaminated as soon as possible, identified, and
properly marked in accordance with Air Force guidance. The primary resources for the data
contained in this chapter are AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and
Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards, and the Counter-Chemical Warfare
Concept of Operations (C-CW CONOPS) approved MAJCOM training materials.
   20.1.1. The development of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) within the cargo
   movement operations realm used analysis of field operations, functional area publications,
   lessons learned, as well as feedback from functional area managers and subject matter
   experts.
   20.1.2. These TTPs also incorporate best practices and solutions to mitigate the
   consequences of Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) attacks and
   sustain operations in NBCC environments. The decision to use them depends upon the threat
   and conditions present at the airbase. Include NBCC defense TTP in unit or work center
   checklists and job guides. Functional Area Managers (FAM) should review field unit
   solutions and include common TTP into functional area publications and enlisted Career
   Field Education and Training Plans (CFETP). The Civil Engineer Readiness Flight can
   provide assistance on NBCC defense actions and help functional area experts develop TTP to
   support specific operations.
   20.1.3. The TTPs in the following paragraphs do not supercede or replace requirements
   within equipment T.O.s. Follow established procedures for safe operations. Identify
   conflicts or hazards through the Air Force T.O. System or Safety System.
20.2. Cargo Movement Responsibilities:
   20.2.1. Airbase contamination can significantly disrupt air and ground cargo movements if
   the Unit Control Center (UCC) and cargo handlers do not plan and execute preand post-
   attack actions. The UCC must coordinate and identify task priorities and obtain airbase
   support when needed. Cargo handlers must effectively employ preand post-attack measures
   to minimize mission degradation and enable sustained operations. This includes the
   coordinated use of a system that balances the mission criticality level (importance) of the
   cargo with the hazard category (residual danger) associated with the materials to determine
   the appropriate action. Cargo handlers will require assistance from their unit post-attack
   reconnaissance team and Civil Engineer Readiness to determine the degree of

     contamination that may be present on the cargo or in the cargo storage and movement areas.
     Note: The term “Cargo Handlers” applies to personnel in Air Force Specialty Codes
     2T0XX and 2T2XX. Personnel in other AFSCs exercise CBRNE procedures outlined in
     their career field directives.
     20.2.2. The UCC controlling cargo movement will use Table 20.1 to identify the mission
     criticality of the material. Conspicuously mark this code on the cargo.

Table 20.1. Cargo Movement Mission Criticality Level.
 Mission Criticality     Definition
 Level
 C - Critical            Cargo is sufficiently important that it must be transported within 4 hours if
                         possible, regardless of the existence of contamination.

 P - Priority            Cargo is sufficiently important that it must be transported within 12 hours if
                         possible, regardless of the existence of contamination.

 A – Accelerated         Cargo is sufficiently important that it must be transported within 24 hours if
                         possible, regardless of the existence of contamination.

 R – Routine             Mission can be delayed until contamination levels are such that MOPP 4 is not
                         required, regardless of how long the contamination takes to dissipate.

 N – Negligible          Mission can be delayed until there is no measurable indication of contamination.
                         This type cargo should not normally be accepted inside the cargo movement
                         area. Room must be saved for higher priority cargo.



     20.2.3. Use Table 20.2 to determine the hazard category associated with the cargo.

Table 20.2. Cargo Movement Hazard Category.
 Hazard
                Definition
 Category
 1              Actual or suspected surface deposition of biological pathogens.
 2              HD, L, or GB vapor present without contact hazard.
 3              VX, L contact hazard present without measurable vapor hazard.

                HD, GB contact hazard combined with medium level of danger associated with vapor
 4              concentrations (four or five CAM bars with HD and up to six CAM bars with GB)
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                            143


               HD, L, GB, VX contact hazard combined with high level of danger associated with vapor
               concentrations (six or more CAM bars with HD, positive M256A1 tab for L, seven or more
               CAM bars with GB, or six or more CAM bars with VX). Note: In the case of GB, high-
 5             vapor hazard alone can drive this category designation.



     20.2.4. To support cargo movement activities in a contaminated environment, cargo
     handlers must possess 20 books of M8 paper and 1 NBC marking kit (with two chemical
     sign refills).
     20.2.5. Contamination avoidance is the key to success with cargo movement operations.
     Because of time constraints required by Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD)
     operations or other mission requirements and our technological inability to decontaminate
     several substances, contamination avoidance is the single most effective protective
     measure. As with all other operations, the proper implementation of contamination
     avoidance and contamination control measures will directly influence the amount and
     extent of decontamination operations required in a post-attack environment. These
     measures also directly influence when an individual or work center has to assume Mission-
     oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) 4 in an otherwise clean area because contaminated cargo
     entered the site. Accomplish the following pre-attack contamination avoidance measures.
        20.2.5.1. To the maximum extent possible, place cargo underneath overhead cover. This
        can be provided through storage space inside facilities or the use of barrier materials.
        If using barrier materials, triple wrap each pallet. Place one layer under the pallet net and
        two layers over the pallet net. Remove the top layer and replace if it becomes
        contaminated. Place M8 paper on the outermost horizontal layer of the barrier material.
        When a contaminated layer of material is removed, place M8 paper on the next horizontal
        layer.
        20.2.5.2. Develop a Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM) or an Improved CAM (next
        generation CAM) footprint of the cargo storage and movement areas. By annotating
        what CAM readings exist in a known clean environment (false positive), personnel
        will not misidentify the hazard associated with a pallet of cargo and they will not waste
        time and energy attempting to decontaminate something that is clean. Refer to T.O. 11H2-
        20-1, Operator’s Manual for the Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM), for CAM operating and
        maintenance procedures.
        20.2.5.3. Place M8 paper in multiple locations throughout the area. As a minimum,
        position it on every pallet and on flat surfaces in open areas. Do not place it under
        facility eaves or pavilion roofs.
     20.2.6. In addition to the required post-attack reconnaissance and self-aid, buddy care
     activities, accomplish the following actions. Note: The timing of post-attack reconnaissance
     and self-aid, buddy care activities depend on the situation and direction from the airbase
     and unit chain of command. Unless otherwise directed, do not accomplish the following
     activities until after the liquid deposition phase has ended (about 60 minutes).
        20.2.6.1. Determine the contamination status of each individual cargo pallet. Annotate
        and report the result.
144                                              AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


         20.2.6.2. If a single sheet of plastic protected contaminated assets, remove and replace
         the covering within six hours (the faster the better). If a double or triple sheet of plastic or
         canvas protected contaminated assets, carefully remove the outer layer and replace it as
         time permits. Carefully roll the material so the contaminated side is rolled to the inside
         and dispose of the material as contaminated waste.
         20.2.6.3. If barrier materials of any type did not protect the contaminated cargo, mark the
         item as contaminated in accordance with Air Force and unit marking procedures, (NBC
         marking kit, signs on all sides). If contaminated with more than one type of agent
         (chemical and biological for instance), attach both types of signs to the cargo.
             20.2.6.3.1. Further, for prioritizing cargo movement, cargo handlers should annotate
             the front of the appropriate NBC Marking Kit sign with the mission criticality (see
             Table 20.1) and hazard category (see Table 20.2) designator. The code for the
             mission criticality designator will be the first letter of the appropriate word i.e., “C”
             represents critical, and “N” represents negligible. The code for the hazard category
             is the number designator itself (i.e., “3” represents a VX, L contact hazard without a
             measurable vapor hazard).
             20.2.6.3.2. Annotate the specific agent or agents, date, time of marking, and the
             temperature (either Fahrenheit or Celsius) at the time of the marking operation on the
             rear of the marking sign or signs. If using DoD Sampling Kits (biological agent
             samplers), annotate the rear of the sign whether the hand-held assay tests are positive
             or negative. Report the contamination status of each pallet to the UCC.
      20.2.7. Cargo handlers should use Table 20.3 through Table 20.7 to determine what
      decontamination actions, if any, are necessary based on the contaminated cargo’s mission
      criticality level and its hazard category.

  20.2.8. Movement of contaminated cargo. Use the following guidelines when loading and
  transporting contaminated cargo.
     20.2.8.1. Determine the contamination status of the material handling equipment (K-
     loaders or forklifts) and the transport vehicle or vehicles. Determine if the items have
     measurable amounts of contamination. Attempt to locate the pockets of contamination if
     possible. This may entail the use of a CAM to pinpoint pockets of dirt and grease that may
     house agents in liquid or dusty form that M8 paper does not readily identify.
     20.2.8.2. If the transport vehicle is uncontaminated, take the following precautions to
     keep it clean during the cargo movement process.
        20.2.8.2.1. Expediently decontaminate the portions of the material handling
        equipment exposed to either the cargo pallet or the transport vehicle (forklift tines
        and rollers on the K-Loader). Use M295 decontamination kit or 5 percent chlorine
        bleach solution to decontaminate.
        20.2.8.2.2. Personnel should ensure to place plastic or another barrier material in
        the bed of the transport vehicle over the area that the cargo pallet(s) will sit on.
        20.2.8.2.3. Replace the outer layer of barrier material on the cargo pallet(s) if
        necessary.
        20.2.8.2.4. The transport vehicle operator should be the only person in the transport
        vehicle and must wear the appropriate level of IPE.
        20.2.8.2.5. Local cargo handlers should perform the actual cargo loading. Cargo
        handlers should not touch or stand on or inside the vehicle unless absolutely
        necessary. If they must touch or stand on or inside the vehicle, they should use
        decontamination troughs containing 5 percent chlorine solutions to decontaminate
        their gloves and boots before they make contact.
        20.2.8.2.6. Check the clean transport vehicle for evidence of cross-contamination
        and decontaminate with the M295 decontamination kit if contaminated.
        20.2.8.2.7. Seal vehicle chocks or other transport vehicle accessories that may have
        come in contact with contaminated surfaces inside a plastic bag prior to loading.
     20.2.8.3. Appropriately mark the vehicle and the cargo to clearly identify the hazard
     associated with the contaminated cargo.
  20.2.9. Use the following guidelines when loading and transporting clean cargo after
  attacks with chemical or biological agents.
     20.2.9.1. Determine the contamination status of the material handling equipment
     (forklifts and K-loaders) and the transport vehicle or vehicles.
     20.2.9.2. If the material handling equipment and/or transport vehicle is contaminated, take
     the following precautions to prevent them from cross-contaminating the 463L cargo
     pallet during the cargo movement process.
        20.2.9.2.1. Expediently decontaminate the portions of the material handling
        equipment that will come in contact with the cargo pallet.
148                                          AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009


         20.2.9.2.2. Place at least two sheets of plastic or another layer of barrier material in
         the bed of the transport vehicle over the area that the cargo pallet or pallets will sit on.
         20.2.9.2.3. Ensure that the pallet has at least a double wrap of barrier material.
         20.2.9.2.4. The transport vehicle operator should be the only person in the transport
         vehicle and must wear the appropriate level of IPE.
         20.2.9.2.5. Local cargo handlers should perform the actual cargo loading. Cargo
         handlers should not touch or stand on or inside the vehicle or vehicles unless
         absolutely necessary. If they must touch or stand on or inside the vehicle or vehicles,
         they should use decontamination troughs containing 5 percent chlorine solutions to
         decontaminate their gloves and boots after they make contact.
         20.2.9.2.6. Check the pallet or pallets for evidence of cross-contamination and
         decontaminate with the M295 decontamination kit if contamination is present.
      20.2.9.3. Appropriately mark the vehicle to clearly identify the associated hazard.
  20.2.10. Cargo movement personnel should accomplish the following actions when they
  discover they will be receiving contaminated cargo from another location.
      20.2.10.1. Acquire all available information concerning the cargo. To include the
      following information:
         20.2.10.1.1. A description of what the specific cargo is (spare parts for special
         purpose vehicles for example) and to whom on the airbase it belongs.
         20.2.10.1.2. A description of what type of suspected contamination is present on the
         cargo.
         20.2.10.1.3. The physical condition of the cargo (i.e., triple wrapped with barrier
         material, unconstrained rolling stock).
         20.2.10.1.4. The time of cargo contamination in relation to the anticipated reception
         time at the installation.
         20.2.10.1.5. The status of the vehicle operator or operators (i.e., are there any
         casualties and will anyone require the use of a Contamination Control Area (CCA)).
      20.2.10.2. Contact Civil Engineer Readiness and the unit expecting delivery. Request
      assistance with an assessment of the contamination hazard and mission criticality
      associated with the cargo. Use this assessment to determine the degree of required IPE or
      reception activities. Also, use this assessment to change the specific cargo delivery
      location on the installation if necessary.
      20.2.10.3. If the cargo does not have a high mission priority (as stated by the
      receiving unit), assess the ability of the unit and/or cargo handlers to isolate the cargo
      upon reception. If choosing the isolation option, clearly cordon off the area surrounding
      the pallet or pallets with the NBC Marking Kit. Use a cordon radius of 25 feet or as
      directed by Civil Engineer Readiness personnel.
      20.2.10.4. If personnel must expediently use contaminated cargo to facilitate mission
      operations, the receiving unit and/or cargo handlers should take the following actions:
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                   149


       20.2.10.4.1. Ensure reception personnel are in the appropriate MOPP (normally
       MOPP 4).
       20.2.10.4.2. Remove the layers of barrier material (if present), cargo nets, and/or
       pallet banding and dispose of these items as contaminated waste.
       20.2.10.4.3. Verify the type and level of contamination (for example, VX in liquid
       form on metal boxes with no measurable vapor hazard).
       20.2.10.4.4. If feasible, remove the specific cargo from its packaging configuration
       (wooden boxes for instance) and dispose of the packing material as contaminated
       waste.
       20.2.10.4.5. Accomplish appropriate decontamination activities based on the extent
       of contamination, agent or agents present, cargo surface, and time available. Contact
       Civil Engineer Readiness to determine the most effective method.
       20.2.10.4.6. If the cargo items themselves are contaminated, mark them
       appropriately so that work center personnel will immediately recognize the potential
       residual hazard.
       20.2.10.4.7. Each individual should accomplish immediate decontamination and
       process through the airbase CCA when directed by the UCC.

                                         Chapter 21

      OTHER CARGO MOVEMENT INFORMATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE
                        REQUIREMENTS

21.1. Forecasting Cargo Requirements. The Air Force is required to submit forecasting
requirements for airlift and sealift to AMC and SDDC for the purpose of scheduling
movements and setting billing rates. SSCO consolidates inputs from MAJCOMs and submits
forecast requirements in the format prescribed by the DTR, Part II. The forecast incorporates
historical movement data combined with known or projected movement requirements. Program
managers will identify ammunition, aircraft engine, missile, Tactical Air Missile Program
(TAMP), helicopters, support equipment, special weapons, communications equipment, and
vehicle requirements to the SSCO when known, for budget and forecasting purposes. The SSCO
will submit required forecasts to meet established suspense dates.
   21.1.1. Submission of long-and short-range cargo airlift requirements will follow the
   timelines and formats in DTR, Part II.
   21.1.2. Submission of sealift cargo requirements will follow the timelines and formats in
   DTR, Part II.
21.2. SAAM Requests. See DTR, Part II, for SAAM request format and instructions.
21.3. Shipment of Human Remains. Refer to AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program,
Chapter 5; AFI 24-101, paragraph 3.22.; and AMCI 24-101, volume 11, section C, paragraph 30.
For additional guidance, refer to DTR, Part I.
21.4. USAF User-Operated Small Terminal Cargo Operations. Replaced by AFJI 24-114.
21.5. Public Highway Movements. The TO is the installation focal point for ensuring that
Air Force cargo moving over public highways conforms to Federal, State, and local laws,
regulations, and ordinances relating to vehicle size and weight limitations. Except as shown in
the DTR, Part II, and Part III, vehicular movements over public highways must have required
permits issued by State authorities.
   21.5.1. Directory of Permit Officials. TOs maintain a copy of SDDCTEA's The Directory of
   Highway Permit Officials and Mobilization Movement Control Coordinators (MOBCON).
   It contains contact information for state permit officials and a summary of state size and
   weight limits. SDDC Transportation Engineering Agency (SDDC-SA), 720 Thimble Shoals
   Blvd., Suite 130, Newport News VA 23606-4537, publishes and issues this directory.
   The Directory may be accessed at SDDCTEA web-site: http://www.tea.army.mil/ (user
   identification and password must be requested).
   21.5.2. Military Cargo Essential to National Defense. Occasionally, certain highway
   movements require certification, as "Essential to National Defense" due to mission needs.
   This normally applies to essential cargo that must move over the public highway because the
   cargo cannot be reduced in size or weight to move by another mode. Certification for this
   type of movement is supported differently depending on whether movement is via
   commercial carriers or military resources.
AFI24-203_AFSPCSUP_I 30 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           151


      21.5.2.1. For certification for movement via commercial carrier refer to DTR, Part II,
      and submit certification with the rate tender. Justification of essentiality should be
      generated by the shipping activity and submitted to the TO. Request assistance from the
      SDDC Deployment Support Command or theater Combatant Commander.
      21.5.2.2. For certification of movement via organic military resources refer to DTR, Part
      III. Justification of essentiality will be generated by the shipping activity and submitted to
      the TO. Refer to SDDCTEA’s Directory of Highway Permit and MOBCON Officials for
      further guidance. See DTR, Part III, Appendix F.

Transportation Account Code (TAC)—A four-digit code that identifies the appropriate service,
agency, Foreign Military Sales case code, or contractor account responsible for funding
Defense Transportation System transportation charges. The Master TAC Reference Table is
linked from website https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/LG/LSO/lol/ under
Transportation Funding.
Transportation Component Command—(DOD) The three component commands of
USTRANSCOM: Air Force Air Mobility Command; Navy Military Sealift Command; and
Army Surface Deployment and Distribution Command. Each transportation component
command remains a major command of its parent Service and continues to organize, train, and
equip its forces as specified by law. Each transportation component command also continues
to perform Service-unique missions. Also called TCC. (See also United States Transportation
Command in Joint Pub 1-02).
Transportation Control Number (TCN)—The DOD standard shipment identifier
composed of a l7-position number assigned to control a shipment unit throughout the
transportation cycle.
Transportation Plan—A Transportation Plan is required if the FMS purchaser proposes to take
delivery or custody of classified material in the U.S. and use its own facilities and
transportation for onward movement to its territory.
Transportation Priorities—(DOD) Indicators assigned to eligible traffic which establish its
movement precedence. Appropriate priority systems apply to the movement of traffic by sea
and air. In times of emergency, priorities may be applicable to continental United States
movements by land, water, or air. (Joint Pub 1-02).
Two—Level Maintenance (2LM)—2LM is a logistics program used to transfer the repair-
level of select items from base to depot, eliminating high overhead and resource costs. The
three-level maintenance (3LM) process of on-system, base level and depot repair continues for
a number of items. The task for transportation is to move 2LM assets between issue, use and
repair points in a time-definite manner.
Unitization—Assembly of exterior packs of one or more line items of supply into a single load so
that the load can be handled as a unit through the distribution system. Unitization (unitized
loads or unit loads0 encompasses consolidation in a container, placement on a pallet or load base,
or securely binding together. The advantages are reduced damage, increased safety from
handling, reduced pilferage and efficient utilization of space.
Water Clearance Authority (WCA)—An activity that controls and monitors the Continental
United States flow of cargo into Continental United States water terminals.
Working Capital Fund—(DOD) A revolving fund established to finance inventories of
supplies and other stores, or to provide working capital for industrial-type activities. (Joint Pub 1-

  PROCEDURES FOR COMPLETING AF FORM 451, REQUEST FOR PACKAGING
                           SERVICE

A5.1. Instructions for Completing AF Form 451. All entries on AF Form 451 (Figure A5.1.
below) may be handwritten. The guidance that follows corresponds to the blocks shown on the
AF Form 451.
      A5.1.1. Date. Enter the date that you initiate the form.
      A5.1.2. Priority. Enter the supply priority and required delivery date assigned to the
      shipping document. If the request is not for a shipment, enter the date that you need the
      service.
   A5.1.3. Request No. Use this block (packaging activities) for document control purposes.
   The number of copies required of AF Form 451 will depend on local requirements. A
   minimum of five copies is recommended. Three copies are provided to the Packaging and
   Preservation section. The original should remain with the item until packaging is completed.
   Another copy should be used for document control purposes. Document control request
   numbers should be assigned as requests are received. Recommend numbers be assigned in
   ascending sequence for 1 year, starting at the beginning of each calendar year. Document
   control copies are not required if a request control log is maintained. Request control logs, as
   a minimum, should reflect information from blocks 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, and the date completed
   from block 16. If a log is maintained, original copies should be filed, in request
   number sequence, after the packaging service is completed. If a copy is maintained for
   document control purposes, it may be replaced with the original after the packaging service is
   completed. Analysis of completed requests will provide management information to
   evaluate reusable container program deficiencies and trends, and to provide a basis for
   corrective action.
   A5.1.4. To. Enter the organization symbol or name of the packaging activity.
   A5.1.5. From. Enter the organization symbol or name of the activity initiating the request. If
   the form is prepared during the supply turn-in process, enter the symbol or name of the
   activity turning-in the item. Do not enter the symbol or name of the supply activity unless the
   item is being shipped (or packaged for storage) from supply stock. Enter the name of the
   person to contact for information on the request.
   A5.1.6. Shipping Document No. Enter the Transportation Control Number (TCN) from
   accompanying documents. If none is available, enter not applicable (N/A).
      A5.1.7. Issue Document No. Enter the supply document number from accompanying
      document. If none is available, enter N/A.
      A5.1.8. Reason for Request. Check the applicable block, as follows:
         A5.1.8.1. Container Destroyed by User. Check this block when reusable container has
         been disposed of by the user according to local procedures, and a replacement is not
         available from reusable container program resources. If the required SPI container is
         the long-life variety, attach a copy of the document used to turn the unserviceable
