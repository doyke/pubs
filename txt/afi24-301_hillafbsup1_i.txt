           (except Due-In for Maintenance (DIFM) turn-ins) within the confines of the installation 24
           hours per day and 7 days per week. Provide pickup and delivery of supplies and equip-
           ment, except base service store items, to base units by using a time definite delivery con-
           cept of operations. Recommend periodic meetings between Vehicle Operations, Traffic
           Management (TM), Supply, and major customers to ensure delivery schedules/sweeps
           meet mission priorities and customer needs.
               1.2.8.2.10.3.1. Intra supply movement of cargo will remain a Supply responsibility;
               however, movement of cargo from supply storage/issue locations to the Aircraft Part
               Stores (APS) and Flight Service Centers (FSC) will be supported by Vehicle Opera-
               tions.
               1.2.8.2.10.3.2. The movement of DIFM turn-in items will be supported and managed
               by the Supply Flight Service Center (FSC). DIFM issues will be handled in the same
               manner as other MILSTRIP cargo and will be supported by Vehicle Operations.
               1.2.8.2.10.3.3. Movement of cargo internal to a unit i.e., maintenance squadrons, civil
               engineer, communication squadron, operations squadrons, etc, will remain a unit
               responsibility. This does not preclude Vehicle Operations from providing normal
               cargo movement support when the unit does not have the capability to move such
               item(s).
               1.2.8.2.10.3.4. Supply retains primary responsibility for facilitating communication
               between Supply elements, customers, and Vehicle Operations. Time Definite Delivery
               concept of operations is the prime method for all cargo delivery i.e. scheduled sweeps.
               Supply will inform Vehicle Operations of priority deliveries (01, 02, and MICAP),
               identification of turn in requirements, notification of special equipment needs for bulk
               cargo, etc.
               1.2.8.2.10.3.5. Residual workload e.g., sorting and staging of cargo, facilitation of
               customer requirements, etc, will remain Supply responsibilities. Supply will presort to
               accommodate established sweep/route schedules.
               1.2.8.2.10.3.6. Use the Supply Asset Tracking System (SATS) in concert with pickup
               and delivery requirements. Deployment of SATS is not a prerequisite to establishing
14                                                     AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


                   Vehicle Operations P&D services. Base Supply will be responsible for all SATS hard-
                   ware (i.e. warranty, maintenance, and replacement).
                   1.2.8.2.10.3.7. Assist Supply Document Control Element in resolving document
                   errors generated in the P&D function. Supply is the overall OPR for all delivery docu-
                   ment issues.
                   1.2.8.2.10.3.8. Deliver shipments/materiel to DRMO generated from base supply
                   turn-ins or transfers (TRM). This also includes directed and lateral shipments
                   (non-directed) originating from the flight service center and aircraft parts store to TM
                   outbound freight.
                   1.2.8.2.10.3.9. Customers who normally get support from the flightline parts store are
                   responsible for pickup of these items. Vehicle Operations will deliver items to custom-
                   ers not normally supported by a flightline parts store.
            1.2.8.2.11. Provide Prime Knight aircrew support IAW AFI 34-246.
     1.2.9. Operations Supervisor:
        1.2.9.1. Reviews vehicle operations services semiannually.
        1.2.9.2. Provides budgetary data to the Vehicle Operations Officer and/or the Vehicle Operations
        Superintendent (VOO/VOS) for inclusion in the annual flight budget input.
        1.2.9.3. Provides required safety and informational briefings to assigned personnel.
        1.2.9.4. Maintains the training status of all personnel.
        1.2.9.5. Ensures sufficient resources are available to meet contingency or wartime requirements.
        1.2.9.6. Ensure sufficient resources are available to support Time Definite Delivery and Priority
        Delivery of supplies, equipment, and cargo to installation units.
            1.2.9.6.1. Time definite delivery concept of operations is the standard for delivery of supplies,
            equipment, and cargo. Time definite delivery utilizes scheduled sweeps over designated
            routes/areas of the installation. Frequency of scheduled sweeps and number of delivery routes/
            areas is a local determination driven by mission, volume of cargo and customer needs.
               1.2.9.6.1.1. Delivery of priority cargo to include 01, 02, and MICAP, will be delivered
               within 30 minutes. Scheduled sweeps may be used if delivery will be provided within 30
               minutes. Supply is responsible for notifying vehicle operations when priority 01, 02, and
               MICAP items/parts cannot wait for scheduled sweeps.
               1.2.9.6.1.2. Vehicle Operations, in concert with Supply and all customers, will tailor
               sweep frequencies/routes to provide support for primary mission of the installation/base.
               Delivery frequencies/routes should minimize the need for individual unit delivery require-
               ments.
               1.2.9.6.1.3. Priority items/parts resulting from due-out release (DORs) will be delivered
               via scheduled sweeps, unless vehicle dispatch is contacted for an unscheduled delivery.
               1.2.9.6.1.4. Establish operating instructions for items that require special handling
               instructions/procedures, e.g., classified, health hazard, pilferable, electrostatic discharge.

     establish alternative locations (sub-motor pools) to support pickup and delivery services.
         1.2.10.13.1. Develop local procedures in conjunction with Supply to ensure current copies of
         delivery destinations, unit supply POCs, and the Classified Receipt Listing are available.
         When SATS is in use, the smart card contains most of this information, however, in the event
         SATS is unavailable, hard copy documents containing this information will be required.
         1.2.10.13.2. Notify Supply immediately of all unnecessary delays caused by the absence of
         receiving personnel, incorrect addresses, organizational refusal, improper documentation, etc.
         Items precluded from delivery due to these circumstances will be returned to Supply for reso-
         lution and included on the next scheduled sweep or may be picked up from Supply by the cus-
         tomer.
         1.2.10.13.3. Ensure duty dispatcher(s) and all vehicle operator(s) are briefed on established

NOTES:
          1. Fractional manpower noted above based on base population of 3,055.
          2. Core Processes ranked in priority order.
          1.2.13.1.1. Every Vehicle Operations flight should have a copy of their applicable Air Force
          Manpower Standard (AFMS) and ensure all supervisory personnel are familiar with content
          and methodology used to earn Vehicle Operations manpower.
          1.2.13.1.2. AFMS 42A1 applies to locations with a flying mission and AFMS 42A2 applies to
          locations without a flying mission. Contact the MAJCOM Functional Manager to verify the
          AFMS applicable to your location.
          1.2.13.1.3. Reviewing the AFMS’s Statement of Conditions, Process Oriented Description,
          Approved Variances, and Process Analysis Summary is the first step in determining the
          expected level of customer service, identifying potential variances, and measuring the flights
          ability to support mission demands.
          1.2.13.1.4. Workload Data Collection and Productivity. The accuracy of workload data
          entered in the automated dispatch program is critical to assessing flight productivity, substan-
          tiating existing manpower variances, and building historical data to support potential man-
          power variances. A minimum of 12 months historical work load data will be maintained on
          file.
              1.2.13.1.4.1. At a minimum, collect the following data monthly.
                 1.2.13.1.4.1.1. Dispatch Supervision Monthly Workload Record (automated).
                 1.2.13.1.4.1.2. Summary of work by Dispatch Automated Fleet Information System
                 (DAFIS) category codes; i.e., number of requests supported and total in-service time in
                 man-hours.

                   1.2.13.1.4.1.3. Summary of work for approved driving related variances i.e., number
                   of requests supported and total in-service time in man-hours.
                   1.2.13.1.4.1.4. Summary of work by master organization code/user (customer) i.e.,
                   numbers of requests supported and total in-service time in man-hours.
                   1.2.13.1.4.1.5. Workload Analysis (Peak workload) reports for both weekdays and
                   weekends, collect three sets of reports covering the following time periods: 1st thru
                   10th, 11th thru 20th, 21st thru 30th or last day of the month.
                1.2.13.1.4.2. Vehicle Operations Flights will develop local operating procedures that
                address the following:
                   1.2.13.1.4.2.1. Training/continuity procedures used to ensure workload data is entered
                   into vehicle dispatch module in a standardized format.
                   1.2.13.1.4.2.2. Procedures established to ensure required workload data is collected/
                   maintained, and completed transportation requests are reviewed for accuracy within
                   three duty days.
                   1.2.13.1.4.2.3. Workload data back-up procedures.
     1.2.14. Flight Training. The VOO/VOS is responsible for training in the Vehicle Operations Flight.
     Training for the 2T1X1 career field is accomplished through a combination of formal technical train-
     ing, on-the-job training (OJT) and Career Development Courses (CDCs). Training may be further
     enhanced by using commercial sources and/or locally developed programs as appropriate.
        1.2.14.1. The following describes the different forms of training required in this AFSC.
            1.2.14.1.1. 3-Level Initial Skills Course. All airman entering the vehicle operations AFSC
            must complete a initial skills course. Each trainee will receive in-depth training on the func-
            tions of the Vehicle Operations Flight. Upon arrival to the first duty station, new airmen will
            enter a job qualification training (JQT) period to become proficient on the vehicles they are

                                               Chapter 2

                                   OFFICIAL USE OF VEHICLES

2.1. Official Use of Government Vehicles. Statutory law (40 U.S.C. Section 491) prescribes that DoD
establish (DoD 4500.36-R, Management, Acquisition, and Use of Motor Vehicles) an effective means of
limiting the use of government motor vehicles (GMV) to official governmental purposes. One simple
rule applies with respect to official use of government vehicles:
Restrict the use of all DoD motor vehicles, including those rented or leased, to official purposes only,
that is, uses that would further the mission of the Air Force. Providing a government vehicle solely or
even principally to enhance the comfort or convenience of the member(s) is not permitted.
Unauthorized use of government vehicles often results in unnecessary expenditure of funds and public
criticism. Although the major goal of the vehicle operations flight is to provide quality support, com-
manders and vehicle managers must know vehicle use restrictions and ensure the base populace is knowl-
edgeable on what constitutes official use. Refer requests not conforming to governing directives to the
VOO or VOS.
2.1. (HILL) Official Use of Government Vehicles. Refer requests not conforming to governing direc-
tives to the 75th Logistic Readiness Squadron (LGRVO, OR&L/DISPATCH section).

2.2. Penalties for Misuse of DoD Motor Vehicles. Misuse and/or failure to prevent misuse of govern-
ment-owned or -leased vehicles is punishable under Title 31 U.S.C. Section 1349. The unauthorized or
willful misuse of a government motor vehicle can be cause for the following disciplinary actions:
2.2. (HILL) Penalties for Misuse of DoD Motor Vehicles. All suspected government vehicle misuses
will be reported to 75 LRS/LGRVO, Operator Records & Licensing Section (OR&L). After duty hours
contact vehicle dispatch. When vehicle operations is notified, an initial joint technical assessment
between the unit's Vehicle Control Officer (VCO) and 75 LRS/LGRVO Operator Records & Licensing
Section personnel will be conducted using this instruction, Air Force directives, and DoD regulations. If
joint assessment reveals a misuse violation has occurred, 75 LRS/LGRVO Operator Records & Licensing
Section will forward a detailed report to the appropriate unit commander through the 75 LRS/CC who, in
turn, may request a written reply. If requested, the response must include actions taken to prevent recur-
rence of similar misuse cases.
   2.2.1. Military Personnel. Subject to disciplinary action under provisions of the Uniform Code of
   Military Justice or other administrative procedures deemed appropriate.
   2.2.2. Civilian Personnel. Subject to suspension from duty by SECAF, without pay, for not less than
   1 month, and shall be suspended for a longer period or summarily removed from office if circum-
   stances warrant.

2.3. Vehicle Misuse Investigation. Report all suspected misuses to the base transportation office. Trans-
portation conducts a technical assessment of the incident to determine if regulatory official use guidance
has been violated. All substantiated allegations, along with the technical assessment, will be forwarded
to the appropriate unit commander for investigation. Maintain a log of all suspected misuse cases
reported to transportation and a case file on each substantiated allegation.
24                                                     AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


2.3. (HILL) Vehicle Misuse Investigation. All cases must be logged and filed for audit and reference
purposes in 75 LRS/LGRVO Operator Records & Licensing Section. Case files must contain date of mis-
use, unit involved, case number, date VCO was notified, and date the report was sent to the unit com-
mander.

2.4. Priority of Transportation Services/ Making Official Use Determinations. When vehicle trans-
portation is essential to the performance of official business, the following methods shall be considered
in the order shown, to the extent they are available and capable of meeting mission requirements:
     2.4.1. DoD scheduled bus service.
     2.4.2. Scheduled public transportation.
     2.4.3. DoD-owned, rented or leased motor vehicle.
     2.4.4. Voluntary use of privately owned vehicle (POV) on a reimbursable basis.
     2.4.5. Commercial taxicab on a reimbursable basis.

2.5. Making Official Use Determinations. When questions arise about official use of motor vehicles,
they shall be resolved in favor of strict compliance with statutory provisions and the policies of this
instruction. When guidance does not specifically fit a request for transportation support, commanders
will use the following factors when making official use determinations:
     2.5.1. Is the purpose of the trip official?
     2.5.2. Does the request have the potential to create a perception that will reflect unfavorably on the
     Air Force or cause public criticism?
     2.5.3. Will the request impact on mission requirements?
     2.5.4. Is commercial or DoD scheduled transportation available? It is important to note that the Air
     Force does not provide transportation support that competes with commercial services.

2.6. Authorized Uses of Government Vehicles (non-inclusive):
     2.6.1. Temporary Duty. Transportation may be provided between lodgings and duty stations for per-
     sonnel on temporary duty when public or commercial facilities are inadequate or nonexistent. The
     temporary duty status of an individual does not necessarily justify the use of a DoD motor vehicle.
     Use of the vehicle will always be predicated on need, distance involved, and other conditions that jus-
     tify their use. When an adequate DoD or commercial bus system is available, the use of any individ-
     ual motor vehicle or commercial rental car is prohibited. When authorized, a government motor
     vehicle may be operated:
         2.6.1.1. Between places where the member’s presence is required for official business, or
         between such places and temporary lodgings.
         2.6.1.2. Between places of business or lodging and eating establishments, drugstores, barber
         shops, places of worship, cleaning establishments, and similar places required for sustenance of
         the member. If used off-base, restrict the use of these vehicles to reputable eating establishments
         in reasonable proximity to the installation.

     2.6.1.3. Between places of business or lodging and installation bowling centers, officer and non-
     commissioned officer clubs, gymnasiums or any on-base non-appropriated fund activity (i.e., golf
     courses, rod & gun clubs, etc.) facilities required for the comfort or health of the member. Use of
     motor vehicles for transportation to or from any other entertainment or recreational facilities is
     prohibited.
  2.6.2. Units may provide transportation to military and civilian personnel officially taking part in
  public ceremonies, parades, and military field demonstrations. This is not to be interpreted as author-
  ity to transport a member’s relatives or personal friends invited to attend activities such as retirements,
  promotions, awards ceremonies, dedications, funerals, or any other similar type functions.
  2.6.3. Transport civilian organizations (nonreimbursable) to military installations to take part in base
  activities in the interest of community relations when officially invited and approved by the installa-
  tion commander or other competent authority. This is not to be interpreted as authority to transport a
  member’s relatives or personal friends invited to attend activities such as retirements, promotions,
  awards ceremonies, dedications, funerals, or any other similar type functions.
  2.6.4. Authorize reimbursable transportation support for community service programs as prescribed
  by AFI 35-201, Community Relations Program, when certified by the installation Public Affairs
  Officer.
  2.6.5. Official use for active duty personnel include transportation to or from Air Force scheduled
  appointments, i.e., MPF records check, dental appointments, hospital outpatient appointments, etc.
  Use transportation priorities specified in paragraph 2.4.
  2.6.6. Transportation of family members is the responsibility of the sponsor. Dependents may use
  publicized, regularly scheduled shuttle buses or mass transportation services on a space-available
  basis.
  2.6.7. Personnel conducting official off-base duties are authorized to stop at off-base eating establish-
  ments in the immediate vicinity of the off-base work site.
     2.6.7.1. This authority does not include eating or stopping at private quarters.
     2.6.7.2. Personnel are not authorized to stop at shopping or dining facilities on, or in the close
     proximity of, the installation while in route to off-base locations.
  2.6.8. The installation commander may approve alert aircrews, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile
  (ICBM) personnel, and emergency response forces use of government vehicles to and from on-base
  activities or facilities. Provide a listing of units approved by the installation commander to each unit
  commander and VCO. Alert crews, ICBM personnel, and emergency response force may not drive
  vehicle to private quarters, for domicile-to-duty purposes, or to conduct personal business.
  2.6.8. (HILL) The following quick response units are authorized to take a unit response vehicle to
  and from on-base activities or facilities.
     2.6.8.1. (Added-HILL) 75 Security Forces (75 SFS).

     2.6.9. The installation commander may authorize Operations Group Commanders (OG/CCs) to drive
     their vehicles to on-base quarters incident to the performance of their duties in connection with
     on-going flight operations. This should not be interpreted as having Command and Control Vehicle
     (CACV) authority. The intent of the policy is to allow OG/CCs to go home to eat during ongoing
     flight operations without having to transfer to a POV. Vehicles will not be driven to quarters and
     parked overnight.
     2.6.10. The use of government vehicles is authorized to support mental health facilities when mental
     health patients are in outpatient status. Mental health must prearrange transportation support and such
     support must be part of patient therapy ordered by a medical physician. Medical personnel must
     accompany the patients.
     2.6.11. Vehicle Allowance Standards authorize intercity buses to installations supporting AF bands.
     Authorize and assign these vehicles to the Vehicle Operations Flight with the band as the primary user.
     Use the buses for other transportation needs when no band requirements exist. The band pays all TDY
     expenses for transportation personnel who provide operator support. If Air Force owned intercity
     buses are not available to meet band requirements, the base transportation squadron must arrange ade-
     quate alternative transportation, to include commercial charter buses. The AF band funds for com-
     mercial charter buses.
     2.6.12. When DoD scheduled bus service or scheduled public transportation is not available or
     impractical, AFRC and ANG members in official status (active duty, active duty for training, annual
     tour, inactive duty for training pay and non-pay) are authorized transportation for line of duty travel
     including to and from temporary lodging quarters.
     2.6.13. Authorize transportation support to liaison officers of (chartered) Civil Air Patrol (CAP) orga-
     nizations for annual programs when it is not detrimental to the mission.
     2.6.14. Authorize child care centers limited transportation support based on the availability of vehicle
     operators and vehicles when it is not detrimental to the mission. Limit support to child development
     center sponsored activities. Do not provide transportation between on or off-base housing areas and
     the child development center. Do not authorize Air Force vehicles on a permanent basis to child
     development centers.
     2.6.15. Each organization must develop its own local policy directives for the transport of family
     pets. Commanders should only allow this pursuant to official business. GOVs should be used on a
     space-available basis with no detriment to the mission. The family pet must always be under the con-
     trol of the owner, either leashed or caged, in order to ensure the safety of the driver and passengers.
     Owners should be held responsible for the behavior of their pets and any damage caused to a vehicle
     should be charged to the owners.
     2.6.16. Chapel Support. Provide transportation to the installation chaplain and chapel personnel per-
     forming official duties in the same manner as other mission support activities. Support includes direct
     administrative support and staff assistance visits to off-base locations. The installation staff chaplain
     submits the transportation request for chapel program activities such as picnics, special groups, social
     activities, renewal activities, chapel youth trips, or summer camps. Submit all requests to transporta-
     tion well in advance of the date required. Support is predicated on the availability of vehicles and
     vehicle operators and must not pose a detriment to higher priority missions.
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                    27


      2.6.16.1. Provide transportation from installation housing areas to installation chapels for weekly
      worship and religious education programs when resources are available, to include UDI vehicles.

      base-level transportation for inclusion in the installations annual budget submission.
   2.6.17. Federal Prison Camp (FPC) Support. Express any arrangements concerning FPC inmates
   operating Air Force vehicles in a written support agreement between the federal agency and the Air
   Force. The support agreement must include provisions that indemnify the Air Force from claims from
   the inmates’ driving activities as well as provisions to reimburse the Air Force for any vehicle or other
   property damage that may occur. HQ USAF/XO/IL must approve all agreements.
      2.6.17.1. Use Air Force vehicles to perform work stipulated by a support agreement. Do not use
      Air Force vehicles to conduct other prison business or for inmates to conduct personal business.
      2.6.17.2. Do not authorize or assign Air Force vehicles to a prison facility. Air Force flights using
      FPC inmates for labor may transport them to and from work sites.
   2.6.18. Air Force Museum Support. Transportation service (U-Drive, Radio Taxi, Non-Radio Taxi
   and Mass Transportation) in support of appropriated funded AF Museums may be provided when
   such transportation can be made available without detriment to the DoD mission. Figure 2.1. lists AF
   Museums that receive appropriated funds.
      2.6.18.1. Museums cannot have vehicle authorizations for passenger carrying vehicles. Restrict
      support to utility type vehicles for use in maintaining facilities and displays. Process requests for
      Air Force vehicle support as any other vehicle support request. They must comply with all estab-
      lished guidelines.
      2.6.18.2. Provide support using the means most economical to the Air Force. Museums that do
      not receive Air Force appropriated funds are private organizations and not authorized permanent
      Air Force vehicle support.
NOTE: The above policy does not apply to the Air Force museum at Wright-Patterson AFB OH.
   2.6.19. Government motor vehicle support for USAF sponsored counterpart and foreign attachè trips
   for both the principals and their spouses is authorized. This authority applies when GMVs are avail-
   able; otherwise Official Representation Funds (ORFs) or other government fund cites will be provided
   for rental vehicles.
   2.6.20. Air Force vehicles assigned to housing offices may be used to transport newly arrived mem-
   bers in overseas areas to available or potential rental properties in local communities. The following
   guidelines apply:
   2.6.21. Only housing office employees can transport members in GMVs to search for off-base hous-
   ing.
   2.6.22. The base housing manager should consider the adequacy of local sponsorship programs and
   the availability of private or commercial transportation before authorizing the use of assigned GMVs
   to support members obtain off-base quarters.
   2.6.23. Do not provide base-level transportation and operator support, to include U-Drive-It (UDI)
   vehicles, to individual members for the purpose of house hunting. UDI support maybe provided to the

     housing office to facilitate mass transportation movements. Support will be based on the availability
     of GMVs in relation to mission support requirements.
     2.6.24. Air Force Recruiters may use government vehicles to provide transportation to prospective
     military recruits for interviews, in-processing, and orientation only. The SECAF must approve all
     domicile-to-duty transportation requirements for recruiters.

2.7. Unauthorized uses of Air Force Vehicles (non-inclusive):
     2.7.1. Do not provide exclusive assignment of Air Force vehicles (owned, rented, or leased) to one
     official or employee based solely on grade, prestige or personal convenience.
     2.7.2. Unless authorized under Chapter 5, transportation to, from, or between locations shall not be
     provided for the purpose of conducting personal business or engaging in other activities of a personal
     nature by military or civilian personnel, members of their families, or others.
     2.7.3. As a rule, transportation to on-base dining facilities is an individual responsibility. However,
     the installation commander may authorize personnel to take DoD-owned, rented, or leased vehicles to
     on-base dining facilities.
        2.7.3.1. Do not grant this authority for personal convenience of the member.
        2.7.3.2. Restrict approvals to personnel requiring an emergency or rapid response capability, i.e.,

        mander and VCO.
     2.7.4. Members and their family members will not use government vehicle transportation for per-
     sonal social engagements or personal business. Members and their dependents may use publicized,
     regularly scheduled transportation services (i.e. shuttle buses, airport transportation service, etc.) on a
     space available basis. Do not provide a larger vehicle to accommodate space-available passengers.
     2.7.5. As a rule, do not provide vehicle support to spouses at additional expense to the government
     when accompanying the member on official business.
        2.7.5.1. The spouse may travel with the member at added expense only when there is an unques-
        tionable official requirement for the spouse to actually participate in the function.
        2.7.5.2. Spouse travel on a space available basis when accompanying the member is authorized as
        long as the size of the vehicle is no larger than that required for the performance of the members
        official business.
     2.7.6. Do not use Air Force-owned, rented or leased vehicles for personal or government directed
     household good moves.
        2.7.6.1. Members are not provided vehicle support for moves related to dormitory renovation or
        commander directed relocations. Members facing such moves are authorized to receive all appro-
        priate personal property shipping entitlements.
        2.7.6.2. Installation commanders may waive this personal property shipping entitlement for emer-
        gency or unusual circumstances as set forth in Title 37 U.S.C. Section 406(e). Refer personnel
        requesting transportation support for household good moves to TMO.
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                      29


   2.7.7. Unless incident to the performance of official duty, do not use or park government vehicles at:
   commissaries, base exchanges (including all concessions), bowling centers, officer and noncommis-
   sioned officer clubs, gymnasiums or any non-appropriated fund activity (i.e., golf courses, rod & gun

   status may use publicized, regularly scheduled transportation services (i.e. shuttle buses, airport trans-
   portation service, etc.) on a space available basis. Do not provide a larger vehicle to accommodate
   space-available passengers.

2.8. Transportation Between Domicile and Place of Employment. With the exception of Command
and Control Vehicle Authorizations (CACV), the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) must approve all
domicile-to-duty authorizations. Title 31 U.S.C. Section 1344, is the sole authority for use of government
transportation between a residence and place of employment, and section 1344(b) designates specific
positions authorized home-to-work transportation. For the Air Force, those are the SECAF and the Chief
of Staff. The SECAF may authorize others home-to-work transportation only when one of three condi-
tions exist: (1) a highly unusual circumstance presenting a clear and present danger (for example, the
threat of terrorist attack), (2) an emergency (for example, a public transportation strike), or (3) other com-
pelling operational considerations (defined as those circumstances with an element of importance which
are essential to the successful accomplishment of the Air Force mission or are necessary for the Air
Force’s efficient operation). Installation commanders may authorize the use of government transportation
to those not otherwise entitled when danger to public health and safety is of such imminent seriousness
that timely approval by the SECAF would be impossible. If provided, immediately notify HQ USAF/ILT
to begin the approval and notification process. Unless waived by the Assistant Secretary of Defense
(Comptroller), obtain reimbursement.
   2.8.1. Approval Procedures. Federal law requires the SECAF (non-delegatable) to approve written
   determinations for domicile to duty requirements cited above. The determination must include: (1)
   the name (or other identification, if confidential) and the title of the individual, (2) the reason for the
   determination, and (3) the anticipated duration of the authorization. The initial approval will not
   exceed 15 calendar days. If the circumstances continue, the SECAF may approve a subsequent deter-
   mination of not more than 90 additional calendar days. The process may continue as long as required
   by the circumstances. Submit original or subsequent determination requests to HQ USAF/ILT. The
   SECAF advises the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House of Representatives
   Committee on Government Operations of each determination.
   2.8.2. Field Work. The SECAF determines who is eligible to use home-to-work transportation for
   field work. IAW 41 CFR, Subpart 101-6.401(g), field work means official work performed by an
   employee whose job requires itinerant-type travel involving multiple stops within or outside the
   accepted local commuting area. Some examples of field work could include:
       2.8.2.1. Medical officers performing outpatient medical service away from a hospital.
30                                                      AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


        2.8.2.2. Military recruiters who proceed directly from their domiciles to conduct official recruit-
        ing matters, when it is determined to be infeasible or impractical for the recruiter to first proceed
        to an office location where the government vehicle is normally garaged.
     2.8.3. Do not use the field work exception when: (1) the individual’s workday begins at his or her
     official government duty station, or (2) the individual normally commutes to a fixed location, however
     far removed from his or her official duty station. In situations where it’s more cost-effective to pro-
     vide the member a vehicle for home-to-work transportation rather than have the member travel a long
     distance to pick up a vehicle and drive back toward or beyond his/her residence to perform his/her job,
     MAJCOMs should consider requesting home-to-work authorization under compelling operational cir-
     cumstances. Submit all Air Force field work requirements biannually to HQ USAF/ILT for consoli-
     dation and submission to the SECAF for approval. HQ USAF/ILT will forward approvals to affected
     units. Submit out of cycle requests to HQ USAF/ILT.
     2.8.4. Logging Home-To-Work Transportation Requirements. The person(s) or position(s) autho-
     rized home-to-work transportation by the SECAF under provisions of paragraph 2.7.4. must maintain
     a log to enable an auditor or inspector to establish that the transportation was used only for official
     purposes. The log must contain: (1) the name and title of the individual (or other identification, if con-
     fidential); (2) the name and title of the authorizing individual; (3) the vehicle registration number; (4)
     the dates, location, duration, and circumstances requiring the home-to-work transportation; and (5)
     precautions taken to ensure the security of the vehicle. Maintain this log for a period of 3 years.
2.9. (Added-HILL) Safety and Security.
     2.9.1. (Added-HILL) All operators of GOVs are responsible for the safe operation of assigned vehi-
     cles. Perform operator care and maintenance inspections prior to use of all GOVs and document the
     inspection using the appropriate AF Form 1800, Operator's Inspection Guide and Trouble Report.
     Operators will sign the back of the form to verify an inspection was completed. Operators must iden-
     tify and document all mechanical discrepancies. Immediately report all safety discrepancies to Vehi-
     cle Maintenance Customer Service Center at building 1253 or local vender for GSA leased vehicles.
     Do not operate unsafe vehicles or vehicles with discrepancies where operation may cause further dam-
     age. Only 75 LRS personnel (mechanics) or local venders will perform vehicle maintenance beyond
     normal operator care responsibilities.
     2.9.2. (Added-HILL) Operators and passengers will use lap and shoulder restraints (seat belts).
     Vehicle operators must adhere to all posted speed limits (GOVs will not exceed posted speed limits)
     and ensure all cargo is properly loaded and secured.
     2.9.3. (Added-HILL) Do not consume alcoholic beverages within 8 hours of, or while, operating a
     GOV. Do not use tobacco products in GOVs (AFI 40-102, Tabacco Use in the Air Force, paragraph
     2.2.5).
     2.9.4. (Added-HILL) Do not eat or drink while operating a GOV.
     2.9.5. (Added-HILL) Do not take GOVs on unimproved roads unless in direct mission support.
     2.9.6. (Added-HILL) If involved in an accident while operating a GOV, do not move the vehicle
     until you have contacted the appropriate authorities. Moving a GOV is permitted only if absolutely
     necessary to prevent another accident or if it compromises safety.
     2.9.7. (Added-HILL) Contact 75th Security Forces Squadron for on-base accidents.
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                31


   2.9.8. (Added-HILL) Contact local police department for off-base accidents.
   2.9.9. (Added-HILL) If the vehicle is a safety hazard, move it only enough to clear the hazard. For
   further instructions on what to do if involved in an accident, refer to SF 91, Motor Vehicle Accident
   Report, and DD Form 518, Accident Identification Card, which are required in every vehicle.

                                         FLEET MANAGEMENT

3.1. Fleet Management. Fleet Management is responsible for the efficient and economical operation of
the base vehicle fleet. The element provides written management analyses and is responsible for base
vehicle buy submissions, establishing and management of the vehicle control program, the licensing of
vehicle operators, accountability of the vehicle fleet, and performing quality assurance evaluations. The
Fleet Management element:
     3.1.1. Supports AF Form 1252/1252A, USAF Vehicle Serv-O-Plate and Vehicle Identification
     Link (VIL). The Base Fuels Management Office (BFMO) is responsible for serv-o-plate manage-
     ment and the automated fuel service station (AFSS) equipped for VIL. Vehicle Operations will pro-
     vide the BFMO a semi-annual, or as required, master list depicting all assigned vehicles and
     organizations codes. A system will be developed between the BFMO and Fleet Management to
     ensure notification of vehicle deletions, assignments, and rotations.
     3.1.2. Records On-Base Fuel Consumption. Air Force vehicles operated solely on government instal-
     lations are exempt from Federal taxes charged on the fuel consumed. In order to get appropriate tax
     credit for the fuel consumed by these vehicles, they must be identified and tracked. Fleet Manage-
     ment provides a list of vehicles that operate only on the installation to the BFMO. This list is updated
     quarterly, and must include the vehicle registration number, unit, and all grades of product that will be
     used (e.g. MUR, MRR, DL1, DL2, CNG, LNG etc.). BFMO will use this list to encode the VIL with
     a Type Issue/Defuel (TID) code. Tax refunds are filed quarterly by SA-ALC/SFRF for ground prod-
     ucts consumed at all AF bases. If any vehicle uses a county, state, or federal highway one or more
     times during the quarter, that vehicle cannot be tax exempt and will not be included on the list pro-
     vided to the BFMO. Crossing over a county, state, or federal highway at an intersection does not
     count as use.
     3.1.3. Records Off-Base Mileage. Fleet Management will develop procedures for documenting
     off-base mileage data to distinguish between on-base and off-base accrued mileage. AF Form 1380,
     Record of Off Base Mileage, will be used to record the mileage data. Documentation will be for-
     warded to Accounting and Finance (ACF) to recoup state taxes paid for mileage traveled on the instal-
     lation. If the state does not charge taxes on government fuel purchases, documentation of off-base
     mileage is not required.
     3.1.4. Manages Toll Tickets. Locations where travel requires payment of tolls will develop proce-
     dures to maintain and issue tickets to operators in the proper denominations to cover passage.
     3.1.5. Administers Emergency Roadside Repair Forms. Fleet Management controls and issues AF
     Form 15, United States Air Force Invoice, and SF 44, Purchase Order-Invoice Voucher, for emer-
     gency roadside repairs. Either form may be used.
NOTE: Contract locations where maintenance costs are paid as part of the contract, and there is an alter-
native method of paying for off-base repairs, are exempt from maintaining the AF Form 15.
     3.1.6. Analyses and Reports. Effective vehicle management includes continuing process improve-
     ment by constantly assessing customer needs, analyzing services, and monitoring efficiency, econ-
     omy, and utilization of the vehicle fleet. The VOO/VOS are responsible for ensuring the analyses for
     evaluating fleet performance and utilization, transportation services, and vehicle authorizations are
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                33


  accomplished. Recommendations from an analysis must be validated and documented. Fully docu-
  ment decisions, process improvements, or corrective action taken as a result of analyst recommenda-
  tions. The fleet management module of OLVIMS complies data necessary to accomplish these types
  of analyses. The following are minimum analyses requirements:
     3.1.6.1. Authorization Analysis. Fleet Management will conduct an authorization analysis on all
     vehicle authorization requests (refer to Chapter 6 for justification requirements). The objective
     of the analysis is to validate the requirement and determine whether a more cost effective avenue,
     such as short-term leasing or co-utilization of assets, can satisfy the requirement without adding
     additional authorizations. VOO/VOS will use the conclusions of the analysis to make approval/
     disapproval recommendations to the Logistics Commander (LG).
     3.1.6.2. Annual Utilization/Rotation Analysis. Rotate vehicles when practical and economical to
     help ensure they will reach their programmed life expectancy. The fleet management module of
     OLVIMS will be used to determine how well the fleet compares to established Air Force and base
     mileage averages and other vehicle management objectives. Air Force goals listed in TO
     36A-1-1301, Vehicle Management Index File, are used as the basis for utilization/rotation analy-
     sis. Analysis and summary of actions need to be documented. Authorization deletions, changes,
     and rotation need to be considered for under utilized vehicles. Consider utilization data, mission
     requirements, and the cost of moving equipment when determining if rotation actions are neces-
     sary. Results of this analysis must be documented to include rationale for action(s). NOTE: GSA
     or other leased assets are required to be included in this analysis.
     3.1.6.3. Semiannual Vehicle Operations Services Analyses. Vehicle Operations services must be
     continually analyzed to ensure process improvement, cost effectiveness, efficiency, and quality
     customer service. are achieved. Each analysis must document corrective actions or operational
     adjustments to enhance services. Results and recommendations are reviewed by the VOO/VOS in
     concert with the Vehicle Operations Supervisor and Fleet Manager and implemented as appropri-
     ate. All analyses will be derived from data complied over a consecutive seven (7) day period.
     Longer time periods may be used as deemed appropriate by the VOO/VOS.
         3.1.6.3.1. Bus Service Analysis (base shuttle, mass transit, etc.). As a minimum, this analysis
         will address the following:
            3.1.6.3.1.1. The number of authorized and space available users boarding at each stop.
            3.1.6.3.1.2. Any recommendations the operators and customers submit.
            3.1.6.3.1.3. Computation of the cost per mile.
            3.1.6.3.1.4. Comparison of bus stops versus high-usage taxi request locations.
            3.1.6.3.1.5. Review of the size of vehicle(s) being used to support the requirement.
         3.1.6.3.2. Taxi Service Analysis (Radio/Non-radio). As a minimum, this analysis will address
         the following:
            3.1.6.3.2.1. Taxi response time. USAF standard is 10 minute response time. If excessive,
            recommendation to improve services are made.
            3.1.6.3.2.2. Average response time, if exceeds, USAF standard, document rationale and
            corrective action.

        3.1.6.3.2.3. Number of requests canceled or number of pickups delayed due to the lack of
        vehicles or manpower.
        3.1.6.3.2.4. Analyze taxi standby point versus frequent pick-up and drop-off locations.
     3.1.6.3.3. Transient Aircrew Transportation Analysis. As a minimum, this analysis will
     address the following:
        3.1.6.3.3.1. Response time. USAF standard is 10 minute response time. If excessive, rec-
        ommendation to improve services are made.
        3.1.6.3.3.2. Average in-service time.

AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                    35


   3.1.7. Establishes a Vehicle Control Program. The purpose of the vehicle control program is to
   ensure units meet Air Force vehicle management goals. Base activities with vehicles assigned on a
   permanent basis will have a Vehicle Control Program. Unit Vehicle Control Officers (VCOs) and
   Vehicle Control Noncommissioned Officers (VCNCO) are appointed by the unit commander to act as
   designated liaisons with the base transportation activity. Fleet Management is responsible for orient-
   ing all newly appointed VCO/VCNCOs on Air Force vehicle management policies. Associate units
   will participate in and support the host vehicle control program. Associate unit vehicle control pro-
   grams are subject to assessment by the host command IG.

NOTES:
     1. The Vehicle Operations Flight is exempt from inspections and staff assistance visits under the
        VCO program.
       2. AFOSI vehicles leased through GSA in CONUS are exempt from inspections and staff assis-
          tance visits.
       3.1.7.1. Conducts Annual Vehicle Control Function Assistance Visits. A Vehicle Control Func-
       tion (VCF) assistance visit will be conducted annually. The results will be documented to include
       the topics discussed, noted discrepancies and noteworthy comments, and provided to the unit
       commander. Copies may be provided to tenant command staff assistance teams and IG teams upon
       request. The VCO/VCNCO is provided the following information during each visit:
          3.1.7.1.1. An analysis of vehicle utilization as it compares to base averages and Air Force
          goals.
          3.1.7.1.2. Issues such as operational problems, vehicle rotations, utilization, requirements,
          security, operator training and licensing, lesson plans, and misuse, will be discussed.
          3.1.7.1.3. A computation of O&M cost per mile for each unit vehicle.
       3.1.7.2. Performs Semiannual Wing Assessment Vehicle Inspections. At a minimum, Fleet Man-
       agement will conduct a random inspection of a least 10 percent of the installation fleet (owned or
       leased) every six months. Fleet Management determines the types based on trends that could
       affect mission support. Inspections will emphasize safety items, unreported damage and operator
       care. Inspection criteria will be developed locally and provided to each unit commander. A con-
       solidated report will be provided to the Logistics Commander after each inspection cycle.
   3.1.8. Manages the DoD Fleet Credit Card System. The DoD Fleet Credit Cards are used to obtain
   fuel and services from off-base commercial service stations. Defense Energy Support Center (DESC)
   is the program manager and policy oversight for the DoD card. Each registered Air Force motor vehi-
   cle authorized for off-base dispatch may be assigned a fleet services card. As a rule, vehicle operators
   should obtain approval from the host base vehicle maintenance activity before using the Fleet Service
   Card to obtain off-base maintenance services. Units should develop local use procedures. The vehi-
   cle registration number and “United States Air Force” should be embossed on each card. To facilitate
   bulk fuel issues, each host base vehicle operations flight is authorized to obtain generic cards. Generic
   cards may reflect work section descriptions, i.e., 96th Vehicle Operations.

NOTES:
     1. Transportation commanders have the option of establishing alternative off-base refueling pro-
        grams if more conducive to local vehicle operations functions. Develop local procedures to
        ensure control and security.
       2. AFMC and AFOSI activities with indigenous assets assigned are exempt from this policy.
       3.1.8.1. Ordering the Fleet Service Card. Each host base fleet management staff must establish a
       account with the authorized vendor.
       3.1.8.2. Funding and Payment Procedures. Specific payment procedures must be established at
       each host base when accounts are established. Make all payments directly to the authorized ven-
       dor. Provide ACF an estimate of non-fuel purchases to be made against all fleet credit cards each
       fiscal quarter. This is accomplished by preparing an AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization,
       and forwarding the original and one copy to ACF for approval at the beginning of each quarter.
       The approved copy is authority to cite funds for purchases. A separate funding file will be main-
       tained for each account. The file will include:
          3.1.8.2.1. Copies of the AF Form 616, current quarterly funding documents
          3.1.8.2.2. Fund cite authorization
          3.1.8.2.3. Current quarterly funding documents
          3.1.8.2.4. Requests for additional or supplemental funds.
       3.1.8.3. Administering the Fleet Credit Card. The Fleet Management staff is responsible for issu-
       ance and administration of the fleet credit card. Duties include:
          3.1.8.3.1. Developing a local driver training/user guide.
          3.1.8.3.2. Acquiring the minimum amount of fleet credit cards to meet installation require-
          ments.
          3.1.8.3.3. Controlling the credit card register and the issuance of fleet credit cards.
          3.1.8.3.4. Reviewing user control documents and credit register semiannually to include a
          physical inventory.
          3.1.8.3.5. Reporting questionable purchases to unit commanders.
          3.1.8.3.6. Posting all non-fuel delivery tickets on AF Form 616.
          3.1.8.3.7. Forward a copy of all delivery tickets to Maintenance Control & Analysis (MC&A)
          weekly for processing.
          3.1.8.3.8. Verifying and certifying vendor’s invoice when received.
          3.1.8.3.9. Forwarding invoice and delivery tickets to the ACF.
          3.1.8.3.10. Preparing and issuing an SF 1094, U.S. Tax Exemption Certificate, when tax due
          on invoice exceeds $10.00. The monthly vehicle analysis report includes tax reported and
          exemption summaries.
       3.1.8.4. Control of the fleet credit card. Fleet Management will maintain a control file to account
       for the fleet credit cards. The control file will contain, but not be limited to, a receipt for on-hand

                               OPERATOR RECORDS AND LICENSING

4.1. Policy. Air Force motor vehicles shall only be operated by military, civilian employees, approved
civilian contractors, and Nonappropriated fund (NAF) employees who meet all criteria of this instruction.
The vehicle operations officer (or personnel designated by the VOO as authentication officials) is the
installation licensing authority. All exceptions to this licensing policy must be approved by HQ USAF/
ILTV.
     4.1.1. Air Force Academy cadets are considered “military” (10 U.S.C. Section 8075).
     4.1.2. ROTC cadets in their junior/senior year whom are issued military identification cards on
     annual training are considered active duty military.
     4.1.3. Individuals serving as Civil Air Patrol corporation liaison officers are authorized to operate Air
     Force vehicles while engaged in official Air Force missions.
     4.1.4. JROTC instructors are technically employees of their school districts and not the government.
     Therefore, they are not covered under the federal torts claim act in case of accident and are not autho-
     rized to operate government motor vehicles.
     4.1.5. Foreign military personnel may operate Air Force vehicles when on official orders performing
     temporary duty at an Air Force installation. The individual must present an international license
     issued outside the country the Air Force installation is located, or applicable military license issued by
     their military service. Before operating any Air Force vehicle, the vehicle operator must demonstrate
     proficiency and be briefed by the sponsoring unit on official use polices, accident reporting, vehicle
     abuse, and operator care responsibilities.
NOTE: For entry, award, and retention of the 2T1X1 Vehicle Operator/Dispatcher Air Force Specialty
(AFS), personnel must possess a valid state driver’s license.

4.2. Operator Records and Licensing Office. The Operator Records and Licensing (ORL) office is a
subfunction of Fleet Management. This office is responsible for licensing and maintaining motor vehicle
operator records for assigned military and civilian personnel authorized to operate Air Force owned,
rented, or leased motor vehicles.

4.3. Driver Records.
     4.3.1. The ORL staff maintains active records (AF Form 2296, Vehicle Operator Information (Part
     3)) for all authorized operators, regardless of motor vehicle type or Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW),
     assigned to the installation. Operator records are retained in the Licensing module of OLVIMS.
     Backup files are to be maintained for all system records.
     4.3.2. When personnel transfer from one installation to another, their driver record must be activated
     by the ORL office at the gaining base before operating a GMV.
        4.3.2.1. Each month, the Military Personnel Flight distributes a list of personnel who are sched-
        uled for permanent change of station (PCS). The VOO/VOS (or designee) must ensure receipt of
        the list and forward a hard copy of the AF Form 2296 to the MPF.

       license for medical or physical restrictions and notes them in Section I on the AF Form 171,
       Request for Driver’s Training and Addition to U.S. Government Driver’s License, if applica-
       ble. Any restrictions are annotated on the AF Form 2296 and printed on the AF Form 2293 (if
       issued).
       4.4.1.2. The unit VCO will brief the member on Air Force policy regarding official use, accident
       reporting procedures, vehicle abuse, discrepancy reporting, the use of DD Form 518, Acci-
       dent-Identification Card, and the use of SF 91, Operator’s Report of Motor Vehicle Accident.
       4.4.1.3. The member presents the AF Form 171 to the ORL staff who establishes a AF Form 2296
       and issues AF Form 2293 (if required) to the member.
       4.4.1.4. Issuance of an Air Force license to personnel possessing a valid motor vehicle license
       issued in any of the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, or a similar licensing
       jurisdiction is waived for operation of government owned or leased, commercial design, general
       purpose vehicles, telephone maintenance trucks and military designed general purpose vehicles of
       14,000 pounds GVW or less, when authorized by the unit commander. NOTE: An AF Form
       2296 must still be maintained in OLVIMS.
       4.4.1.5. When military personnel transfer from one installation to another, their government oper-
       ators permit must be validated by the ORL office at the gaining base before operating a GMV.

       4.4.1.7. Duplicate AF Form 2293. A duplicate AF Form 2293 may be issued to replace an AF
       Form 2293 that is misplaced, damaged, or stolen. A verification of the individual’s AF Form 2296
       is required to issue a duplicate license without recertification.
   4.4.2. FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL. The AF Form 2293 issued to military personnel (including
   members of the Reserve and National Guard that are subject to the UCMJ) is valid indefinitely, unless
   suspended or revoked. When military personnel separate from the service, they may keep their AF
   Form 2293 if the words “NOT VALID-SEPARATED FROM THE SERVICE” are overstamped or
   legibly marked on the front and back of the form. See paragraphs 4.7. and 4.8. for civilian and con-

     tor. A temporary license will not be issued to a student with a suspended or revoked state or commer-
     cial license. Ensure the expiration date of the temporary permit is entered in the AF Form 2296.
        4.4.4.1. Only the USAF Vehicle Operator Apprentice Course may utilize “span of control” for
        training students in vehicle operations. Technical Training students in formal training may operate
        vehicles in a controlled environment (range, obstacle concourse--not open for public use) without
        an instructor inside the vehicle. Instructor must be present in the immediate area and maintain
        communication with student operator at all times. “Span of control” cannot be utilized for
        base-level on-the-job (OJT), a qualified trainer is required to be in the vehicle.
     4.4.5. Personnel in TDY status may operate Air Force vehicles when on official orders and they pos-
     sess a valid state or military license for the vehicle to be operated. All personnel will be briefed on
     official use policies and operator care responsibilities prior to operating Air Force vehicles. Do not
     maintain a driver record of TDY personnel operating Air Force vehicles in the Licensing module of
     OLVIMS.
     4.4.6. Qualifying a Non-US Citizen. Unit instructors must prepare bilingual, written, or verbal tests
     to cover foreign country driving laws and regulations for non-US citizens employed by the Air Force.

        ing the driver), any vehicle transporting hazardous materials in such quantities that the vehicle is
        required to be placarded under the hazardous materials transportation regulations (49 CFR 383.5),
        must possess a CDL. Civilian employees will purchase CDLs at their own expense and obtain any
        subsequent renewals.
        4.4.7.2. Exceptions (DoD Civilians). The following are the only waivers that apply to civilian
        employees.

4.6. Operation of Motor Vehicles on Air Force Flightlines. See AFMAN 24-306.

4.7. Federal Civilian Employees.
   4.7.1. Policy. A civilian who is employed as a motor vehicle operator and/or incidental operator must
   meet the training requirements in the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) and 40-series Air Force publi-
   cations.
      4.7.1.1. The OF Form 345, Physical Fitness Inquiry for Motor Vehicle Operators, is used to
      review and certify an employee’s capability to operate a government -owned or -leased motor
      vehicle. The OF Form 345 is only required for civilian employees who possess an AF Form 2293.
      4.7.1.2. Physical standards referred to in the FPM do not apply to the Air Force Reserve and the
      Air National Guard technicians. Their vehicle operator records are handled in the same manner as
      active duty military operators.
      4.7.1.3. The expiration date of the AF Form 2293 issued will be the same as the civilian member’s
      state or CDL.
      4.7.1.4. Every 4 years (after a physical examination if required) the VCO reviews each federal
      civilian employee’s capability to operate a GMV or continue to retain the AF Form 2293. Civilian
      operators must meet prescribed physical standards and demonstrate competence to operate a
      motor vehicle.
   4.7.2. Although base maintenance, construction, and materiel handling vehicles are excluded from
   the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) motor vehicle definition and operator requirements,
   civilian operators of these vehicles will comply with licensing requirements in this chapter.

4.8. Licensing Contractor Personnel:
   4.8.1. A contractor employee required to operate government vehicles in the execution of a govern-
   ment contract must be licensed by the state on the vehicles they operate. It is the responsibility of the
   contractor, not the Air Force, to ensure operators are appropriately licensed as a condition of employ-
   ment. A state or commercial license will be used as certification to operate vehicles specified in the
   contract. No further government licensing is required unless:
      4.8.1.1. The contractor operates a government provided vehicle when commercial licensing is
      waived under P.L. 99-570 (such as fire fighting vehicles) issuance of the AF Form 2293 is
      required. The AF Form 2293 is issued only for the inclusive dates of the contract and appropri-
      ately annotated with any required restrictions such as “on base only”.
   4.8.2. Prior to allowing any contract personnel to operate government vehicles the contractor must:
      4.8.2.1. Certify individuals are trained, licensed, and physically qualified to operate the vehicles,
      and briefed on official use policies. This will be accomplished by letter, signed by the contractor,
      listing each individual and the types of vehicles they will be operating. This certification will be
      updated as necessary and remain on file in ORL.
44                                                    AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


        4.8.2.2. ORL will maintain a file in the Licensing Module of OLVIMS on each contractor
        employee operating special purpose vehicles licensed with a CDL or AF Form 2293. Only the
        minimum amount of information is necessary for identification to assist in accounting, control-
        ling, and investigations.
        4.8.2.3. Fleet Management will void any issued AF Forms 2293 upon completion of the contract
        or upon individual termination of employment. The employee may keep the voided copy.

4.9. Licensing of Federal Prison Camp (FPC) Inmates. FPC inmates are not licensed by the Air Force
to operate Air Force vehicles. Inmates that are allowed to operate Air Force vehicles under the terms of a
HQ USAF approved support agreement will be appropriately licensed by the state on the vehicle required
to be operated.
Operator licenses issued by the Federal Prison may be accepted in place of a state license. Draft support
agreements should be submitted to HQ USAF/ILTV for review and coordination. They should include
provisions to indemnify the Air Force for claims flowing from the inmates’ driving activities, as well as
provisions to reimburse the Air Force for any vehicle or other property damage which may occur.

4.10. Requirements for Contingency and Remote Areas. Certain personnel assigned to contingency
and remote areas are required to have an AF Form 2293 before they report for duty, since facilities for
examining and training operations at these sites may be limited or nonexistent. The parent or losing com-
mand will ensure that licenses and qualification records are issued to these personnel.

4.11. Suspension/Revocation of Government Vehicle Operator’s Driving Privileges. Vehicle opera-
tor driving privileges will be suspended, revoked and reinstated using the guidance contained in AFI
31-204. Base law enforcement activities, acting on behalf of the installation commander, administer the
program.
     4.11.1. Security Police notifies the ORL office when individuals have their driving privileges sus-
     pended, revoked, or reinstated.
     4.11.2. Individuals who have their driving privileges suspended or revoked must return their AF
     Form 2293 to the Operator and Licensing Section. Action causing the revocation/suspension will be
     entered in the Licensing Module of OLVIMS.
     4.11.3. All GMV driving privileges are suspended when an individual’s authority to drive civilian
     vehicles on base is suspended. Upon reinstatement of on-base driving privileges for civilian vehicles,
     full GMV driving privileges (including off-base) will be restored (including reissue of the AF Form
     2293) unless specifically withheld by competent authority, i.e., Security Police, individual’s com-
     mander.
     4.11.4. Unit commanders or equivalent may suspend or revoke a vehicle operator’s GMV driving
     privileges for due cause. The commander must notify the ORL office in writing of this action and
     ensure the operator’s AF Form 2293 is returned to the Operator Records and Licensing section.
     4.11.5. Suspension for Substance Abuse. The unit commander determines if a person involved in
     substance abuse will have their government vehicle operation privileges suspended and reinstated.
     The commander must notify the VOO of all suspension and reinstatement actions.
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                    45


4.12. Restoration of Driving Privileges:
   4.12.1. While the State Operator’s Permit is Still Suspended. Government vehicle driving privileges
   may be restored while the on-base driving privileges are suspended if requested by appropriate com-
   mand authority. The level of authority who approves the government vehicle driving suspension must
   also approve the reinstatement. A copy of the approval must be maintained in the ORL office. An AF
   Form 2293 is then issued for on-base operation only. Reinstatement in these cases is based on mission
   essentiality of the person involved and a certification that the person cannot be assigned duties that do
   not involve driving.
   4.12.2. Reinstatement of a State Operator’s Permit. Government vehicle driving privileges are rein-
   stated, unless deemed inadvisable by competent command authority.

4.13. Reexamining an Operator. An operator is given a reexamination on abilities to safely operate a
vehicle when:
   4.13.1. Considered necessary by the unit commander due to an accident, evidence of abuse or mis-
   use, moving violations, or a display of poor judgment or behavior.
   4.13.2. Affected by a physical impairment that results in a physical profile change as determined by

                                                  Chapter 5

                                     VEHICLE AUTHORIZATION

5.1. Vehicle Requirements. Federal law controls the purchase of passenger-carrying vehicles for gov-
ernment use. Congress authorizes the purchase of government vehicles through the Appropriations Act
and sets statutory price limitations for purchasing certain vehicles. Quantities listed in authorization doc-
uments for vehicles determine budgetary requirements and must not include additional assets for in-main-
tenance replacements, pipeline, or vehicles in depot maintenance. Meet peak workload and unusual
requirements for vehicles by borrowing from other government agencies, renting, or leasing vehicles
from GSA or commercial sources. Use POVs on a reimbursable basis according to JTR.
     5.1.1. Limousines. Restrict the use of Class V sedans (see Figure 5.1.) to these DoD officials and
     visiting foreign officials of comparable rank (Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 41, Chapter 101,
     Subpart 101-38.1 and 101-39.2):
        5.1.1.1. The Secretary of Defense.
        5.1.1.2. The Deputy Secretary of Defense.
        5.1.1.3. The Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.
     5.1.2. Large Sedans. Restrict the use of Class IV sedans to these DoD officials and to visiting foreign
     officials of comparable rank:
        5.1.2.1. The Secretaries of the Air Force, Army, and Navy.
        5.1.2.2. The Chiefs of Staff of the Air Force, Army, Chief of Naval Operations, and the Comman-
        dant of the Marine Corps.
        5.1.2.3. The Under Secretaries of Defense.
        5.1.2.4. All four-star commanding officers.
        5.1.2.5. Directors of defense agencies.
        5.1.2.6. Class IV vehicle requirements for protective services must be approved by SECAF. The
        requesting official must successfully demonstrate that the use of a smaller vehicle will not meet
        the protective mission requirements. Submit requests to HQ USAF/ILSR.
     5.1.3. Other Classes. Passenger sedans and station wagons acquired for support, other than those
     specified in 5.1.1. and 5.1.2. above, will be Class IA, IB, or Class II. SECAF may grant exceptions to
     this restriction. Fully justify the request for an exemption and forward through MAJCOM transporta-
     tion to HQ USAF/ILSR.
     5.1.4. Authorization of Class III Midsize Sedans. Public Law stipulates that Class I or Class II sedans
     be used to meet daily mission requirements. When Class I or Class II sedans clearly do not meet mis-
     sion requirements, the law allows limited exception authority to authorize the use of midsize sedans.
     Forward all requests for Class III sedans to HQ USAF/ILSR. Retain all justification documentation
     on approved Class III sedan authorizations at the MAJCOM and by the approval authority (SECAF).
     Class III sedan authorization requests will include the following information in justification requests:
        5.1.4.1. The intended use of the sedan. Will the vehicle be used for domicile-to-duty or command
        and control purposes? If so, has approval been obtained?
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                             47


      5.1.4.2. A clear statement of why a smaller vehicle will not meet mission requirements. Class III
      sedans will not be authorized based on position, rank, or personal preference.
      5.1.4.3. State the intended source of the vehicle and that the source is the most economical to the
      Air Force. Submit a cost comparison analysis for each sedan requirement with the justification.
      The analysis must clearly indicate the most cost effective method for sourcing the requirement.
      Failure to provide the analysis will result in disapproval of the request. Only use leasing when
      there is a clear cost savings to the Air Force.
      5.1.4.4. Who will drive the vehicle? Identify the AFSC or job series of the driver.

5.2. Vehicle Authorization Review Authority. IAW Title 40 U.S.C. Section 491, only the minimum
number of vehicles necessary to support the mission should be authorized. The wing Logistics Group
(LG) Commander is the vehicle authorization review authority for the installation. The LG:
   5.2.1. Reviews and validates vehicle requirements, and vehicle change requests.
   5.2.2. Recommends increases or decreases in vehicle authorizations.
   5.2.3. Reviews and approves the annual base priority buy submission.
   5.2.4. Approves the Vehicle Priority Recall List and the Minimum Essential List (MEL) annually.
   5.2.5. Reviews the vehicle distribution and sourcing plan to support the Emergency War Order
   (EWO) and/or other contingency taskings during the Base Support Plan (BSP) process.
   5.2.6. Evaluates effectiveness of the local rotation program using data in the annual utilization and
   rotation report.
   5.2.7. Evaluates operation and maintenance cost data against Air Force cost program objectives.
   5.2.8. The LG considers the following to address additional vehicle authorizations:
      5.2.8.1. Use vehicles from the UDI fleet to satisfy short duration or sporadic mission require-
      ments.
      5.2.8.2. Types and quantities of vehicles must be clearly the minimum number to accomplish the
      mission.
48                                                     AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


        5.2.8.3. Do not authorize vehicles for reasons of grade, prestige, personal convenience, or to indi-
        vidual persons except as stated above.
        5.2.8.4. Review vehicles that do not meet Air Force or base utilization goals for possible authori-
        zation or rotation actions.
        5.2.8.5. Services staff engaged in direct administrative support may use general purpose vehicles
        acquired with appropriated funds. Do not acquire vehicles with appropriated funds justified either
        partially or wholly for transportation support of MWR activities. See AFI 65-106, Appropriated
        Fund Support for Morale and Recreation and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalties for addi-
        tional guidance.
NOTE: Allowance Standards 019 through 032 prescribe the maximum allowances (not authorizations)
to accomplish organizational and functional missions. Establish special allowances to meet unusual mis-
sion requirements when properly justified.

5.3. Air Force Zero Growth Policy. MAJCOM vehicle ceilings, set and managed by HQ USAF/ILSR,
implement the USAF zero-growth vehicle policy. MAJCOMs will not exceed these ceilings without AF/
ILSR approval. MAJCOM requests to exceed ceilings must be supported by a verifiable mission change,
e.g., POM, OPLAN, PPLAN, etc. Any non-mission change increase will be offset by adjustments to
other vehicle authorizations to preclude an overall increase in authorizations. Each MAJCOM will estab-
lish policy to maintain ceilings.

5.4. AF Form 601, Equipment Action Request. Use an AF Form 601 to justify adjustments to vehicle
requirements. Use the same form to justify vehicles if they are the same type, they perform similar func-
tions, or they fall under the same allowance source code in the allowance standards. The allowance stan-
dard is the allowance document for validating vehicle authorizations and is not an authorization
document.

5.5. Excess Vehicles. The VOO or VOS redistributes excess vehicles to base activities having open vehi-
cle authorizations or reassigns them to replace older vehicles eligible for replacement. Do not assign
excess vehicles to organizations waiting approval for additional vehicle requirements. Vehicle Operations
will control excess vehicles pending MAJCOM action.
     5.5.1. If reassignment to another base activity is not possible, vehicle maintenance accomplishes a
     limited technical inspection. Send the AFTO Form 91, Limited Technical Inspection --Motor Vehi-
     cles, and the request for disposition instructions, to MAJCOM transportation within 60 calendar days
     from the date the vehicle becomes excess.
     5.5.2. Initiate follow-up disposition action after 60 calendar days.

5.6. Vehicle Requirements Process. WR-ALC/LE programs vehicle acquisitions for the Air Force
through the vehicle Priority Buy (PRIBUY) program.
     5.6.1. WR-ALC/LE annually:
        5.6.1.1. Provides MAJCOM/LGTs with specific PRIBUY submission instructions/guidelines.
        5.6.1.2. Compares MAJCOM PRIBUY submissions against requirements stated in AFEMS
        (DSDC001).
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                  49


       5.6.1.3. Jointly resolves any inventory discrepancies with MAJCOM/LGTV staffs.
       5.6.1.4. Compiles the Air Force vehicle budgetary requirement.
       5.6.1.5. Is the review authority for specifications, purchase options, purchase descriptions, and
       standards for procuring Air Force vehicles.
       5.6.1.6. Determines MAJCOM allocations, and coordinates shipment of assets acquired.
   5.6.2. MAJCOMs annually:
       5.6.2.1. Provide priority buy submission guidelines to base level transportation activities.
       5.6.2.2. Compile and prioritize MAJCOM requirements.
       5.6.2.3. Submit MAJCOM vehicle requirements through an off-line PRIBUY program (0204).
       5.6.2.4. Work with WR-ALC/LE to resolve any inventory data discrepancies.
       5.6.2.5. Provide WR-ALC/LE with shipping information and special specification requirements.
       5.6.2.6. Monitor due-ins.
   5.6.3. Mission Need Statements. Document all vehicle requirements and modifications in a Mission
   Need Statement (MNS) when R&D efforts are required during program development or the program
   has joint service or allied nation applicability. Follow procedures in AFI 10-601 for processing a
   MNS.

5.7. Specification Review. WR-ALC/LE forwards the vehicle specifications for all other vehicles by 15
October to the lead command for use during the following fiscal year’s buy process. The lead command
is usually the dominant user of a specific vehicle type. WR-ALC/LE does not review specifications for:
vehicles bought through GSA, M-series vehicles, or vehicles on an optional or multi-year contract for the
follow-on fiscal year.
   5.7.1. The Lead Command:
       5.7.1.1. Coordinates the specifications with appropriate agencies within that command.
       5.7.1.2. Forwards one copy of the specifications to each using command senior transportation
       official.
       5.7.1.3. Consolidates all responses and works out all disparities and forwards a single coordinated
       response with recommended changes by 15 February to WR-ALC/LE.
   5.7.2. Using Commands:
       5.7.2.1. Coordinates the specifications with the appropriate command agencies.
       5.7.2.2. Forwards a single consolidated response to the lead command by the suspense date.
NOTE: Specifications will not be “gold-plated” with “nice-to-have” items or capabilities.

5.8. First Article Testing. Normally, contractors must develop at least one first article vehicle for full
testing. Commands may observe and participate in these tests. WR-ALC/LE is the liaison in this effort.
50                                                      AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


     5.8.1. Test Parameters. Contractors define the test parameters for in-plant first article testing. When
     possible, WR-ALC/LE will provide a copy of the parameters to the lead command 15 days prior to the
     test. WR-ALC/LE can address questions about the test parameters.
     5.8.2. Test Procedures. For tests in the factory, the manufacturer normally accomplishes the tests and
     the Defense Contract Administration Service (DCAS) monitors those tests.
        5.8.2.1. WR-ALC/LE can require a second first article vehicle. Commands may assist in making
        that decision. Request a second prototype at the same time the specification review response is
        made. The lead command provides recommended user test parameters and pass or fail criteria.
        Send the second prototype to the Air Force base designated by WR-ALC/LE and the lead com-
        mand.
        5.8.2.2. Air Force personnel and the manufacturer conduct tests at a base. The lead command
        ensures the primary users of the vehicle participate in the tests.
        5.8.2.3. The lead command forwards a report of the test results to WR-ALC/LE 15 days after the
        test is complete.
        5.8.2.4. WR-ALC/LE makes the final decision on specifications, revisions, user test parameters,
        and pass or fail criteria.
     5.8.3. Operational Test & Evaluation. Use operational test and evaluation (OT&E) procedures on
     major 463L vehicles, aircraft tow tractors, large refueling vehicles and most crash fire equipment.
     The lead command and the vehicle system program manager coordinates the use of OT&E on vehicle
     types within 6 weeks after the Annual Buy Budget Review.

5.9. Vehicle Rental and Lease Administration:
     5.9.1. DoD components may rent or lease motor vehicles when any of these conditions exist:
        5.9.1.1. An economic analysis verifies a cost benefit to the government. Reference AFI 65-501,
        Economic Analysis, for economic analysis requirements and procedures.
        5.9.1.2. Unforeseen requirements demand vehicles prior to acquisition through normal procure-
        ment.
        5.9.1.3. Local laws or status of forces agreements prevent using government vehicles.
        5.9.1.4. Normal REMS procedures or resources cannot fill the authorization.
     5.9.2. SECAF must approve authorizations for Class III and Class IV sedans prior to initiating rentals
     or leases.
     5.9.3. The requester may accept the next larger size vehicle (if rented less than 60 days) without
     obtaining SECAF approval if the rental agency does not have the authorized size vehicle. This does
     not apply to Class III and IV sedans.
     5.9.4. Transportation activities are the office of primary responsibility (OPR) on all installation rental
     and lease approvals. The Transportation Squadron Commander will coordinate on all lease requests
     prior to submission to contracting.
        5.9.4.1. Fleet Management validates all requests for rentals and leases for installation activities.
        Coordinate with Contracting to ensure vehicles are not rented/leased without prior validation
        regardless of who funds for the rental/lease. Lease or rental may be executed with AF Form 9 or,
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                  51


      where guidance allows, IMPAC government credit card. A copy of validated AF Form 9 or
      related IMPAC documents will be retained in Fleet Management.
      5.9.4.2. Fleet Management will maintain a log of all leases/rentals. The log should list each pur-
      chase request in numerical sequence and the reason for its initiation.
      5.9.4.3. Requesting units/users provide funds for each lease.
NOTE: All requests for long-term leases are justified on an AF Form 601, Equipment Action Request,
and forwarded to MAJCOM Transportation for action. Approved requests must remain on file until the
lease is terminated.
   5.9.5. Upon termination of a vehicle rental or lease, Fleet Management verifies and certifies charges.

5.10. Vehicle Lease Procedures:
   5.10.1. Short-Term Lease. Transportation commanders may rent or lease vehicles to meet peak
   workloads and unusual or emergency requirements for periods not to exceed 1 year (provided organi-
   zational O&M money is available) without established authorizations. When rental or leases of vehi-
   cles exceed 60 days, request written support from the host MAJCOM/LGT identifying the vehicle
   type, quantity, and duration of the lease. Use GSA vehicles if they are available. Confirm nonavail-
   ability from the MAJCOM before executing a commercial lease exceeding 60 days for general pur-
   pose vehicles. Keep nonavailability certification documents for 1 year. Do not use this authority to
   provide transportation for normal or routine purposes, when vehicles are available. Rentals or leases
   that exceed 1 year must have a valid authorization.
   5.10.2. Long-Term Lease. Leasing over one year is generally to fill open authorizations not filled
   through normal acquisition procedures.
      5.10.2.1. Requests must be sent to MAJCOM/LGT for approval. MAJCOM/LGT approves all
      lease requests except lease to buy clauses.
      5.10.2.2. Base transportation reviews and validates all vehicle lease requests. Transportation will
      process requests to the base LG for approval or disapproval recommendations. Forward an AF
      Form 601, Equipment Action Request, to MAJCOM/LGT for processing. Enter the allowance
      source code of the authorization temporarily filled by a lease vehicle in the allowance identifica-
      tion column of the form. Obtain written approval to extend leases past the approval period. Justi-
      fications will include:
          5.10.2.2.1. Current authorizations and assets by type to be leased.
          5.10.2.2.2. Number of vehicles on hand that exceed the Air Force standards for age and mile-
          age.
          5.10.2.2.3. Model year, mileage, and estimated repair cost of the vehicle to be replaced.
          5.10.2.2.4. Other types of excess vehicles on-hand which are suitable for substitution.
          5.10.2.2.5. Whether the vehicles are required to fill open authorizations or required to replace
          existing inventories.
          5.10.2.2.6. Impact or course of action if authority to lease is not granted.
          5.10.2.2.7. Whether the request is a new or renewal lease.
52                                                    AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


            5.10.2.2.8. Monthly and annual costs for the lease. It must include the basic cost, mileage
            charges, and fuel and maintenance costs.
            5.10.2.2.9. Anticipated period of use.
        5.10.2.3. Use short-term leases to satisfy emergency requirements pending receipt of long-term
        lease approval.

5.11. Funding for Long-Term Leased Vehicles. Vehicle rentals are funded by unit Operations and
Maintenance (O&M) funds. Vehicle acquisitions are funded with investment funds, BP8200-3080 from
congressional authorization and appropriation acts annually. The purchase of vehicles using O&M funds
is not authorized. When executing a long-term lease, contracts with option to buy requires prior approval
by WR-ALC/LE.

5.12. Lease with Option to Buy. Lease with option to buy is an accepted method of entering into
long-term vehicle leases per the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Sections 7.401, 7.402, and 17.201.
WR-ALC/LE must approve all leases with an option to buy clause. In a lease with option to buy contract,
the cumulative lease costs and the cost to exercise the purchase option must not exceed the purchase cost
unless fully justified in writing. Execute leases with O&M funds but do not procure vehicles with these
appropriations. If approved for purchase, and an offset is provided, HQ USAF/ILSR will send BP8200
(3080 investment) funds through channels to the base.

5.13. Vehicles Procured Using Fast Payback Capital Investment Procedures (FASCAP). FASCAP
procedures apply to special purpose type vehicles only.

5.14. Insurance Coverage and Maintenance for Rented or Leased Vehicles:
     5.14.1. “For Hire” solicitations and resulting contracts provide insurance coverage as prescribed by
     applicable portions of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Unless the rental company requires pur-
     chasing insurance, rented or leased vehicles are obtained with the Air Force providing self-insurance.
     5.14.2. Vehicle operators conduct daily operator care on rented or leased vehicles unless otherwise
     specified in the contract.
     5.14.3. The contractor performs all maintenance on rented or leased vehicles, unless a prior agree-
     ment is made showing it is more economical for the Air Force to perform maintenance.

5.15. Installation of Radio Equipment in Rented or Leased Vehicles. When two-way radio sets are
required, hire vehicles having radio equipment already installed. Install radio sets in government-owned,
rented, or leased vehicles when it is not economical to rent or lease equipment. Use portable or non-fixed
radios when feasible.

5.16. Management Reports. AFI 24-303 details the requirements for operations and maintenance cost
summaries and maintenance labor hours summaries for general purpose vehicles. It also provides guid-
ance for preparing quarterly management reports for all vehicles reported in OLVIMS DSD0009. AFI
24-303 describes how to collect, report, and process data to support IRCN: 1102-GSA-AN, Agency
Report of Motor Vehicle Data.
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                  53


5.17. AF Form 1474, Agency Report of Motor Vehicle Data. The reports require detailed information
concerning the types of vehicles hired, the source of hire (GSA or commercial), and the cost of the vehi-
cles hired.
   5.17.1. AF Form 1474. Reporting Instructions—Unit or Activity:
       5.17.1.1. Reported information includes the 12-month vehicle usage period covering from 1 Sep-
       tember through 31 August of each year.
       5.17.1.2. Send reports to the major command transportation vehicle division by 15 September of
       each year.
       5.17.1.3. Form entries are self-explanatory. Direct any questions about this report to the major
       command headquarters. GSA and the Congress receive summarized data from these reports.
       Accurate data is essential.
   5.17.2. AF Form 1474. Major Command:
       5.17.2.1. Review and consolidate AF Form 1474 data received from base-level activities.
       5.17.2.2. Report AF Form 1474 to WR-ALC/LE via CARS or mail (WR-ALC/LE, Robins AFB
       GA 31098-5609). Send an information copy to HQ USAF/ILTV. Submit the report by 15 October
       of each year.

NOTES:
           1. For completion of this report, the terms “hire,” “contract,” “lease,” and “rent” mean the
              same. Vehicles hired from GSA contractors are the same as capital interagency, capital
              motor, or capital pool vehicles.
           2. Under normal conditions, this report is necessary for planning or implementing
              short-range programs. Agencies assigned C-1 will prepare and submit this report.
           3. This report is designated emergency status code C2. Continue reporting during emer-
              gency conditions, normal precedence. Submit data requirements in this category as pre-
              scribed, or as soon as possible after submission of priority reports. Do not electronically
              transmit this report during MINIMIZE.

5.18. Interagency Motor Pools and Systems. Title 10 U.S.C, 133(d) delegates authority to the Secretar-
ies of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to establish and operate interagency motor pools and systems. Title
40 U.S.C. 486 gives this responsibility to the Administrator of GSA for the actual establishment and oper-
ation. GSA develops necessary data and cost statistics to determine the economic feasibility of establish-
ing a motor pool in an area. DoD components are notified if consolidation is feasible.
   5.18.1. Services Provided by Interagency Motor Pools:
       5.18.1.1. Rent vehicles by the month.
       5.18.1.2. Maintain and provide fuel, oil, and lubricants (POL,) for other government-owned vehi-
       cles.
       5.18.1.3. Store government owned vehicles.
54                                                     AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


     5.18.2. Discontinuing Interagency Motor Pools. If an established interagency motor pool fails to
     achieve a savings during a reasonable period, i.e., 2 successive fiscal years, the GSA administrator
     gives a 60 day notification to discontinue the pool.
     5.18.3. Managing GSA Vehicles. Use GSA vehicles for official purposes only. If leasing GSA vehi-
     cles is more expensive than using Air Force-owned vehicles, or the Air Force cannot resolve opera-
     tional problems with the interagency motor pool, Air Force activities will send full details through
     channels to HQ USAF/ILTV and ILSR for resolution.

5.19. Exceptions for Acquiring, Renting, or Leasing Foreign Made Buses. Federal law requires the
armed forces to use United States manufactured buses to satisfy requirements, unless their use is not eco-
nomical or not in the best interest of the United States. The rule applies when you purchase, lease, rent or
make contractual arrangements for transportation services. These are exceptions to the Federal Law:
     5.19.1. When United States manufactured buses are not available to meet requirements that cannot be
     postponed, foreign manufactured buses may be used temporarily. However, this time must not exceed
     the lead time required for acquiring and delivering United States manufactured buses.
     5.19.2. To meet a special but nonrecurring requirement or where a recurring requirement is sporadic
     and infrequent. The time of use must not exceed the time needed to meet the nonrecurring or recur-
     ring infrequent requirement.
     5.19.3. Where foreign manufactured buses are available at no direct or indirect acquisition cost to the
     US Government.

               REGISTERED EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (REMS)

6.1. Introduction. Air Force motor vehicles are selectively managed by HQ USAF and must be reported
accurately in the Registered Equipment Management System (REMS) reportable assets.

6.2. REMS Duties. REMS managers:
   6.2.1. Process vehicle authorization/asset transactions in the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS).
   Monitor and maintain individual MAJCOM vehicle authorization lists (VALs) for changes, updates,
   additions, and deletions.
   6.2.2. Administer, maintain, and monitor Custodian Authorization/Custody Receipt Listings (CA/
   CRLs) for host and tenant units.
   6.2.3. Document reviews of Allowance Standards (AS) and updates to individual VALs and make
   transactions in the SBSS to reflect changes.
   6.2.4. Maintain allowance source documents (AF Form 601) approved by WR-ALC, HQ AFMC and
   HQ USAF until vehicle requirements no longer exist (ASCs 048, 051, etc.). Retention of support doc-
   umentation is also required as specified in the command sections of the Allowance Standard.
   6.2.5. Process D-16 inquires (XJE9JU). On occasion, an authorization or vehicle has not been cor-
   rectly reported to the Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS). Most correspondence
   received is self-explanatory and may require coordination with base supply EMS section to make data
   correction inputs. Reconcile D-16 processing errors with the Base Supply D-16 monitor in the equip-
   ment management section (EMS) of base supply.
   6.2.6. Monitor associate unit vehicle accounts. Generally, the same procedures apply for disposition,
   issue, turn-in, receipt and authorization of vehicles. However, correspondence is normally sent to, or
   received from, the associate account custodian. A standard exception are vehicles authorized and
   assigned to the Office of Special Investigation (OSI) which are controlled and accounted for at HQ
   AFOSI. No REMS records are loaded at base level for OSI vehicle requirements.
   6.2.7. Clear computer rejects. Correct rejected REMS transactions in a timely manner. Close coordi-
   nation with the EMS D-16 monitor and Document Control Section is necessary.
   6.2.8. Perform SBSS computer transactions. REMS managers will request authority from base sup-
   ply to sign as inspectors for REMS transactions. If approved, REMS managers must request a block
   of off-line requisition numbers from stock control in base supply for vehicle SPRs and RECs.

6.3. Training. REMS managers do not require Block III, General Equipment Custodian Training.
   6.3.1. Ensure personnel assigned REMS manager duties have completed Registered Equipment Man-
   agement Course, J6ANU2T151-000.

6.4. Vehicle Authorization List (VAL). All registered vehicle authorizations will be identified on a
MAJCOM VAL. MAJCOM transportation generates the VAL using the standard format identified in the
MAJCOM module of OLVIMS (formerly MAFIS). This system is the source for all Air Force vehicle
authorizations and is used as a basis on base-level CA/CRLs and in the Air Force Equipment Management
56                                                    AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


System (AFEMS). MAJCOM Transportation transfers VAL data to AFEMS using the AFEMS/MAJ-
COM VAL interface.
     6.4.1. AFEMS/MAJCOM VAL Data Interface. MAJCOM VAL data is used to populate the follow-
     ing authorization tables in AFEMS:
        6.4.1.1. DB86 - Vehicle Authorizations
        6.4.1.2. DB11 - War Plans Additive Requirements
        Incoming MAJCOM VAL data must pass edits within AFEMS in order to populate the above
        database tables. MAJCOM /LGT emphasis should be placed on correcting rejected MAJCOM
        VAL records since they inhibit base-level reporting.
        6.4.1.3. There are two types of edits; Rejects and Variances. A rejected MAJCOM data record is
        not processed and results in base-level (SBSS) data rejecting in AFEMS because the authorization
        record is not loaded. A variance MAJCOM VAL record is processed in AFEMS but requires mod-
        ification.
        6.4.1.4. MAJCOM Transportation should research rejects and variances 24 hours after Val data
        has transmitted to AFEMS. Use the following procedures to access the AFEMS AD HOC query
        application and view specific reject/variance data:
           6.4.1.4.1. Select AD HOC query from the AFEMS main menu. After the selection has exe-
           cuted, query menus will be displayed.
           6.4.1.4.2. Position cursor at the bottom left of the screen next to the word "table:", type "rej*"
           and press enter. This will display AFEMS reject and variance query programs (pub-
           lic.rej_trans & public.rej_trans_db).
           6.4.1.4.3. Position cursor on number 2, press enter or next to the word "table:" at the bottom
           left of your screen, type "2" and press enter.
           6.4.1.4.4. The following screen should be displayed:
                   1 info_sys_desig...: Mafis
                   2 doc_id...........:
                   3 rej_trans_maj_cmd:
                   4 rej_trans_dt.....:
                   5 rej_trans_time...:
                   6 rej_trans_edit_cd: cb (leave blank for
                     all or specify an edit code)
                   7 rej_trans_img....:
                   8 sran.............:
                   9 rej_val..........:
           6.4.1.4.5. Enter the applicable MAJCOM code in "rej_trans_maj_cmd:" field And press PF6
           to initiate the query.
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                   57


          6.4.1.4.6. Once the data is displayed you can format the query (PF5) to restrict data fields or
          move left (PF10) and right (PF11) to view the data. Page forward (PF8) and page backward
          (PF7) are also available.
          6.4.1.4.7. Process rejects and variances by utilizing the edit logic/corrective action informa-
          tion. Once MAJCOM VAL record corrections and/or corrective action has been implemented
          by another agency (i.e. LGS ROF monitor) retransmit the VAL data to AFEMS.
NOTE: It is vital to retransmit the VAL data file after discrepancies are corrected. The AFEMS "Daily
Curupt Report" can also be used to locate rejects/variances.
   6.4.2. Non-registered vehicles, including “scooters” will not appear on the VAL and are handled as
   Non-REMS equipment items reflected on the equipment accounts of the owning unit. MAJCOMs
   with WRM vehicle authorizations must ensure LGX receives a copy the VAL.

6.5. Allowance Standard (AS) 019. 6.5. AS 019 identifies core Air Force vehicle allowances. Core
allowances are those allowances common to all Air Force commands. AS 020 through 034 identifies
vehicle allowances unique to specific MAJCOMs or equivalents. If a BOI does not exist, a request to
establish a BOI must be sent to the MAJCOM. If approved by the MAJCOM, the request will be sent to
WR ALC for final approval and inclusion in the applicable AS.

6.6. Allowance Standards (AS). ASs are identified in AFMAN 23-110V2. The ASCs most commonly
used in vehicle fleet management are:
   6.6.1. 000 - Unauthorized Equipment on Hand: Reports excess vehicles awaiting disposition instruc-
   tions. Vehicles in ASC 6.6.2.
   6.6.2. 000 will have status code “X” assigned and not be in 000 more than 90 days.
   6.6.3. 000A - Excess Equipment: Reports excess vehicles awaiting AF Form 601 action. Vehicles in
   ASC 000A will be status code “J.”
   6.6.4. 019 - 034 - Allowance Standards: Prescribes maximum allowances for vehicles to accomplish
   functional and organizational missions. Allowance Standards 019 - 034 are source documents only
   and do not constitute authorization or approval authority for vehicles.
   6.6.5. 048 - Retention authority: Under certain conditions, it is more economical to retain a vehicle
   than to have it redistributed or salvaged. When these conditions exist, request an 048 retention author-
   ity through MAJCOM transportation on an AF Form 601. An AFTO Form 91, Limited Technical
   Inspection-Motor Vehicles, must accompany the request. Once approved, major repairs cannot be
   accomplished. When the vehicle is no longer required or meets disposal criteria, request disposition
   instructions.
   6.6.6. 051 - Contractor Support. Use when Air Force vehicles are Government Furnished Equipment
   (GFE) to a contractor and will not be replaced by the Government (USAF). Fleet Management will
   not rotate vehicles to/from a contractor authorized/assigned under AID 051. Authorizations under this
   allowance will be reduced/deleted upon final disposition of the vehicle.
   6.6.7. 054 - Special project: Use to report authorizations supporting a MAJCOM or USAF approved
   special project/program.
   6.6.8. 076 - Base closure: Reports authorizations at installations projected for closing.
58                                                     AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


     6.6.9. 987 - A temporary authorization not to exceed 179 days: Use for short-term vehicle require-
     ments or projects. Consecutive 987 authorizations for the same requirement or project are not autho-
     rized.
     6.6.10. 037 - Appropriated Funded Vehicles for Contractors. Use when Air Force vehicles are pro-
     vided as “agency-peculiar” Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to a contractor and the Air
     Force is responsible for replacing the vehicle.

6.7. Justification Requirements. Each of the following questions must be addressed in the justification
block of the AF Form 601, and answered in the affirmative before the request can be sent to the applicable
MAJCOM/LGTV for disposition:
     6.7.1. Does the justification indicate the current VAL using activity or the proposed user?
     6.7.2. Does the justification cite the directive, project, or publication that generated the request, if
     appropriate?
     6.7.3. Does the justification fully explain proposed use of the vehicle?
     6.7.4. Does the justification identify expected utilization information (miles, hours, passengers,
     equipment, supplies, materials, number of trips, etc.)?
     6.7.5. Does the justification list the number of vehicles currently authorized and assigned to the
     requesting unit and justify why co-utilization will not meet mission requirements?
     6.7.6. Does the request justify why transportation support from Vehicle Operations (taxi or UDI) can-
     not satisfy the vehicle requirement (OLVIMS data must substantiate lack of support)?
     6.7.7. Does the justification include a mission impact statement on the organization, base, or wing if
     the request is denied?
     6.7.8. Does the justification cite any actions taken to realign other authorizations to accommodate the
     requirement?
NOTE: The base LG signs the AF Form 601. The justification should be attached.

6.8. Control Numbers. Assign a control number to AF Forms 601 using AFIS/MAFIS. For example; a
9-digit code like “V91250001” where:
     6.8.1. “V” denotes vehicle request.
     6.8.2. “9125” denotes the Julian date the request was submitted to higher headquarters for action.
     6.8.3. “0001” denotes the next available control number from the log for that Julian date.

6.9. Processing of Returned AF Forms 601, Equipment Action Request. Requests returned from
higher headquarters will be processed as follows:
     6.9.1. Update the OLVIMS control log approved or disapproved.
     6.9.2. Update REMS records and annotate the VAL if approved.
     6.9.3. Notify the unit of approval or disapproval action.
     6.9.4. Maintain the AF Form 601 with the VAL until the VAL is superseded.
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                 59


   6.9.5. Retention of disapproved AF Forms 601 is determined locally.
   6.9.6. Retain requests for special authorizations (048, 054, 987, etc.) for as long as the requirement
   exists.

6.10. Rental and Leased Vehicle Authorizations. The following actions will be taken to establish
accountability for rental/leased vehicles.
   6.10.1. The lease record will reflect the applicable prime national stock number (I&S NSN) identified
   in AS 019 - 032 and loaded in REMS upon receipt of the approved AF Form 601. Use equipment
   code “L” in FCI 1; REMS authorization load input.
   6.10.2. Establish asset records and report locally assigned stock numbers (L or P number). Upon
   receipt of the rental or lease from the contractor, submit a DD Form 1348-6 to base supply records
   section to have the local number loaded in budget code “Z.” Process the FED issue transaction as fol-
   lows:


  COLUMN                ITEM
  1-3                   FED
  4-7                   SRAN
  8 - 22                Asset NSN (local number)
  23 - 24               System Designator (01) (Single Site)
  25 - 29               Quantity
  30                    Type Detail Code (B)
  31-44                 Document Number (E--VV----)
  50                    Item Code (S)
  53                    Use Code (B)
  54 - 60               ASC (012----)
  69 - 73               SRAN (E----)
  106 - 109             EAID
  110                   2
   Since these vehicles are not controlled by registration numbers or budget code “V”, more than one
   vehicle of the same type can be issued on the same document. When the rental/lease expires, process
   an FME transaction. This input will produce documents necessary to return the vehicle to the contrac-
   tor. FED and FME transactions are not routinely run by the REMS manager. Seek assistance from the
   equipment management section of base supply for proficiency training.

NOTES:


      1. Input of FED creates a receipt (verification of receipt from the contractor) and an issue (of
         vehicle to the using activity). Sign copy one of both documents and deliver to document con-
         trol.
60                                                     AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


        2. FME transactions are run in demand mode/on-line using a separate password. Coordinate
           closely with the RPS section in base supply.

6.11. WRM Vehicles. Refer to AFI 25-101 for WRM authorizations and assignments.

6.12. Vehicle Allocations and Due-In Listing. Each MAJCOM is provided vehicle procurement alloca-
tion and delivery information from WR-ALC/LE. The MAJCOM provides shipping information, to
include add-ons such as special paint/air conditioning/etc., to the item manager, and notifies each base of
allocations they can expect to receive with delivery dates if available. Changes affecting allocation or sta-
tus information are provided to each installation when they become available. Vehicle allocation listings
(due-ins) should be updated as required. This data is also used to validate annual priority buy require-
ments and as a source for vehicle repair decisions.

6.13. Vehicle Receipts and Issues. The following are basic procedures for the receipt and issue of vehi-
cles:
     6.13.1. DD Forms 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, are shipped with new vehicles
     from the manufacturer. Use this form to verify shipping destinations.
     6.13.2. If the asset NSN is new (not loaded in the supply computer), obtain the information from TO
     36A-1-1301 and contact base supply, research unit, to have the asset NSN loaded into the system. If
     the NSN is not listed in TO 36A-1-1301, use indicative data on the master interchangeability and sub-
     stitutability (I&S) NSN for initial upload. Load the NSN with an equipment code “V”.
     6.13.3. After the vehicle is received, verify the NSN and process a special requisition (SPR) and
     receipt (REC) to receive the vehicle. Do not process an SPR if the vehicle is received from another
     Air Force activity. However, do process a REC using the shipping base’s document number. This
     action clears intransit records and establishes accountability and reporting through the C008 data
     bank. Notify the MAJCOM of all vehicle receipts via letter, message, OLVIMS transfer disk, and
     update allocation/due-in listings.
     6.13.4. After processing the REC, process an issue (ISU). Issues must always be for a quantity of one
     (1) since a REMS detail is created for each registration number issued. ISU inputs must contain a
     transaction exception code of “6”, indicating a “post-post” transaction. Ensure the detail record con-
     tains equipment code “V”; otherwise, the REMS detail will not be established during issue process-
     ing.
     6.13.5. Once the vehicle has been received, complete the DD Form 250, block 22, with the date the
     vehicle(s) were received. Forward one copy to the activity shown in block 12.

6.14. Withdrawing Vehicles from the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO).                  The
following procedures apply for withdrawing vehicles from DRMO:
     6.14.1. Vehicles may be considered for withdrawal from DRMO only when an open authorization
     exists, or when the vehicle in DRMO is in better condition than the vehicle assigned. MAJCOM/LGT
     must approve vehicles withdrawn from DRMO to be placed in the Air Force inventory. Vehicle Main-
     tenance Manager (VMM) must certify a vehicle as economically repairable and warrants withdrawal
     action. Refer to AFI 24-302, Vehicle Maintenance Management for additional considerations.
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                   61


   6.14.2. Non-REMS vehicles can be withdrawn for use in Air Force training courses as training aids
   with approval from MAJCOM/LGTV. Submit request through the base supply materiel management
   flight.

6.15. Repair Authority and Disposition. Guidelines for determining repair allowances and approval
levels are in TO 00-25-249 and AFI 24-302. Vehicle maintenance initiates requests for repair approval or
disposition on an AFTO Form 91, Limited Technical Inspection-Motor Vehicles. Requests are routed
through Vehicle Operations to the LGT who has authority to exceed one-time repair limits.

6.16. Reporting Excess Vehicles. Report all vehicles excess to MAJCOM/LGTV. Vehicle maintenance
performs an LTI within 45 days. Change the vehicle status code to “X” and place in an excess detail using
ASC “000.” Only vehicles on record can be transferred to an excess detail. Vehicles in “000” will appear
on the Q09 report. Retain the Q09 report only when equipment code “V” appears on the list.

6.17. Vehicle Disposition Instructions. MAJCOM/LGTV and/or WR-ALC approves disposition
instructions.

6.18. Vehicle Shipments. MAJCOM/LGTV normally directs vehicle shipments. When a vehicle is
shipped, the AF Form 1828, Vehicle Historical Record, Vehicle Master Transfer Report and floppy disk,
Historical Records Jacket and pertinent technical data will be sent to the gaining installation. Process an
AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn-In Request a vehicle turn-in, to remove the vehicle from REMS records. The
turn-in input will create either a “A5J” salvage document or a “SHP” shipping document. In either case,
the REMS manager must sign in block one. Send vehicle record jacket and either the “A5J” or “SHP”
document to TMO. The gaining REMS manager initiates follow-up action on vehicles not received
within the specified time frame.

6.19. Vehicle Shipments to Depot Repair. Certain types of vehicles are eligible for depot-level repairs.
Criteria for these vehicles are contained in TO 36A-1-112, Section II. MAJCOM/LGTV will provide
shipping instructions for vehicles scheduled for depot repair. Three vehicle status codes apply to depot
shipments. Status codes “B” and “G” (accountability not retained by the shipping base) require process-
ing of turn-in documents. Input of either of these two codes will automatically create shipping docu-
ments. Status code “R” (vehicle programmed for return to the base) requires preparation only of an
off-line “DO NOT POST” shipping document. An FCI 2C transaction is required to enter status code “R”
into the REMS records.

6.20. Vehicle Data Reconciliation. The REMS manager and Maintenance Control & Analysis
(MC&A) will perform a monthly reconciliation between the SBSS, and the On-Line Vehicle Interactive
Management System (OLVIMS) computer to ensure data integrity. The REMS manager receives a
vehicle asset list (M06) listing and a floppy disk by the 10th of each month from base supply. The REMS
manager will retain one copy of the M06 to update OLVIMS. The second copy of the M06 and the floppy
disk are given to MC&A for processing of the REMS/VIMS Reconciliation List, PCN SB004-013. The
REMS manager and MC&A perform a joint review of the PCN13. Discrepancies will appear as “Not
Found In VIMS” or “Not Found in REMS.” When a valid vehicle’s data is not reflected in OLVIMS,
MC&A personnel take appropriate action to research and load the vehicle into OLVIMS. When a vehicle
has been shipped or otherwise disposed of, MC&A must delete the vehicle from OLVIMS. MC&A anno-
tates the PCN13 indicating corrective action(s) taken and provides the REMS manager the FCI transac-
62                                                     AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


tion file (PCN SB004-014) on floppy disk in order to update the vehicle replacement codes in the SBSS.
The REMS manager will receive DD Forms 1348-1 from supply confirming replacement code updates.
Although vehicle receipts must be processed within one workday after receipt of the vehicle(s), occasion-
ally, a vehicle is not loaded in REMS. With the exception of AFOSI vehicles, these unreported vehicles
are normally new vehicles not loaded in REMS. The REMS manager must take action to REC/ISU these
vehicles and review and correct the circumstances which led to the receipt failure to preclude recurrence.
Vehicles shipped or disposed of which still appear in REMS must be cleared with the assistance of the
supply D-16 monitor. In addition to unreported assets, the reconciliation may reveal incorrect NSNs or
registration numbers. The following actions should be taken to correct these discrepancies:
     6.20.1. Process a serviceable turn-in (status code Q) against the REMS record in error.
     6.20.2. Re-issue the asset with the correct registration number if the number is in error.
     6.20.3. Contact the base supply inspection section to process an NSN identity change (FCH) if the
     NSN is in error. The REMS manager may be required to submit a letter to the inspection section to
     have the NSN changed.
     6.20.4. The REMS manager corrects error rejects for vehicles. The REMS manager must work with
     the D-16 monitor to ensure receipt and correction of vehicle errors or rejects. The REMS manager
     will annotate the PCN13 of all corrective actions taken.

6.21. Vehicle Replacement Codes. MC&A assigns these codes. Replacement codes have a direct
impact on replacement vehicle programming. Further, these codes are updated in REMS records by pro-
cessing the reconciliation between REMS and OLVIMS. To ensure replacement vehicles are identified
correctly in REMS, MC&A personnel and the REMS manager must ensure the accuracy of the replace-
ment codes in the monthly M06. An explanation of each code is listed below:

6.23. TO 36A-1-1301, Vehicle Management Index File. This TO is the source document for several
data elements used in Vehicle Maintenance and Vehicle Operations for management of the vehicle fleet.
Section II of the TO provides NSNs, management codes, replacement criteria, and standard pricing infor-
mation for all vehicles. Use of this section helps correct programming of OLVIMS vehicle master records
and communications compatibility between base supply and transportation activities. This TO provides
information for identifying suitable substitutes for similar vehicle types. A vehicle will be loaded into
REMS as a suitable (S) substitute only if the asset stock number cross-references to the I&S stock number
listed in this TO. When the asset does not cross to an I&S stock number, but has similar capabilities, load
it as an unsuitable (U) substitute. There may be instances when new production vehicle NSNs are not in
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                     65


the TO; When this occurs, use the applicable I&S stock number. NOTE: The maintenance activity will
normally load the vehicle using the NSN stamped on the vehicle data plate. This could result in reconcil-
iation errors.

6.24. Unreported Assets. WR-ALC/LE, Robins AFB, GA, maintains a worldwide inventory of Air
Force vehicles. This inventory accounts for a vehicle from the time it is assigned a registration number
until it is disposed of. REMS unreported assets are records that WR-ALC has flagged because the USAF
equipment data bank has not reported an active record, nor has a deleted record been processed. The fol-
lowing actions correct asset records determined to be REMS unreported assets:
   6.24.1. If a vehicle has been disposed of send a copy of the H-63 to the item manager with method
   and date of disposition.
   6.24.2. If the vehicle is still active in the base inventory, the following procedures apply:
   6.24.3. The REMS manager must process an “XJE” for the authorized in-use detail record document
   of the unreported vehicle. Process the XJE format with “9JU” in card columns 5 and 6, blanks in
   positions 7-27, and the original date in positions 71-75. Processing the XJE will cause all in-use detail
   records for the input document number to appear in the D-16 report. Process XJE transactions using
   the Worldwide Keypunch Program (WWKRP) and dropped main-line to the RPS. The D-16 monitor
   will verify all authorized and in-use detail records, including the authorized record and vehicle asset
   records, are on the report with action code “X.”
   6.24.4. If the next monthly update does not report the vehicle, WR-ALC will notify the base. The
   D-16 monitor verifies previous actions and contacts the C008 management group with the date of the
   D-16 report and sequence number. The C008 management group will research the cause of the unre-
   ported vehicle.

6.25. Transient Vehicles. Vehicles in transit over 90 days are records WR-ALC flags because they are
not receipted for, or shipped from a base and not receipted for by the gaining base. If the vehicle is loaded
in the SBSS an inquiry (XJE9JU) will reload it to the daily transaction report (D16).

6.26. Computer Documents and Listings. The documents below are “fileable documents.” Copy one
of these documents (DD Form 1348-1, DOD Single Line Item Requisition System Document) is sent to
the document control section within five workdays with appropriate signatures:
   6.26.1. REC - Vehicle receipt.
   6.26.2. FED - Leased vehicle receipt from contractor.
   6.26.3. ISU - Post Post issue.
   6.26.4. SHP - Vehicle Shipment.
   6.26.5. FME - Return of leased vehicle to contractor.
   6.26.6. A5J - Salvage document.
   6.26.7. TIN - Vehicle turn-in, AF Form 2005, if required.
   6.26.8. FET - Transfer of vehicle from one on-base account to another. The following documents do
   not require controls. However, it is suggested one copy be retained with notification letters, AF Forms
   601, messages, etc., to establish audit trails.

     6.26.9. FCI - Authorization load, increase, decrease, or deletion.
     6.26.10. INQ - Inquiries related to REMS details.
     6.26.11. All suspended rejected transactions.
     6.26.12. Retain CA/CRLs (R14 or R23) until replaced. The REMS manager submits an AF Form
     2011, Base Supply ADPE Work Request, to the supply computer section to produce CA/CRLs. New
     copies should be run at least monthly. Request CA/CRLs in stock number sequence or by account
     code (A6 format) to simplify the review process. The equipment management section in base supply
     retains an original signed copy of the CA/CRL (R14) for each vehicle account. All accounts are
     updated annually.
     6.26.13. Retain the M06, Vehicle Asset List, and the PCN 310013, REMS/VIMS Reconciliation List,
     for one year.
     6.26.14. Retain the Q09 report, Allowance Source Code Listings, for one year.

6.27. P-Series Registered Vehicles. The Office of Special Activities (HQ AFMC/XRJ) is the Air Force
focal point for special project vehicles. Do not report P-series vehicles through REMS. HQ AFMC/XRJ
assigns P-series registration numbers, and accounts for the acquisition, procurement, and distribution of
the vehicle fleet until disposition.

6.28. Golf Cars and Low Speed Vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has
established law in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) which address slow moving conveyances that
do not meet traditional Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These conveyances, commonly referred
to as scooters or utility carts, are legal to operate on military installation public roadways if specific crite-
ria are met. Conveyances procured as golf cars/low speed vehicles will be configured to carry no more
than two passengers (driver plus one passenger). Golf cars/low speed vehicles are non-registered assets,
procured as equipment items, using unit funds, and accounted for on the owning unit’s CA/CRL. These
equipment items will not be loaded in REMS. The following definitions and criteria apply:
     6.28.1. Golf cars (not golf carts) are small utility conveyances that are incapable of exceeding 20
     mph. They are only subject to state and local requirements regarding safety equipment for use on mil-
     itary installation public roads. If golf cars are modified from original manufacture specifications to
     obtain speeds in excess of 20 mph, they are classified as motor vehicles and must meet federal safety
     standards.
     6.28.2. Low Speed Vehicles (LSV) are any four-wheeled conveyance with a top speed greater than 20
     mph, but less than 25 mph. LSVs are classified as motor vehicles and must meet specific Federal
     Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (49 CFR 571.500) to operate primarily on military installation public
     roads. LSVs must be equipped with specified headlamps, stop lamps, turn signal lamps, reflex reflec-
     tors, parking brakes, rear view mirrors, windshields, seat belts, and vehicle identification numbers.
     6.28.3. Conveyances designed or modified to operate at speeds greater than 25 mph must meet all
     Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards which apply to passenger carrying vehicles if the vehicle is to
     be operated primarily on military installation public roads. These standards are much more stringent
     that LSV safety standards.
     6.28.4. LSVs of truck design, operating primarily on installation/public roads, must meet the Federal
     Motor Vehicle Safety Standards specific to trucks.
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                              67


  6.28.5. Golf cars and LSVs will be purchased IAW AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual and AFI
  91-207, Air Force Traffic Safety Program:
     6.28.5.1. Units should consider reducing motor vehicle authorization levels prior to purchasing
     utility carts as an alternative mode of transportation.
     6.28.5.2. Purchase requests will be processed through Base Supply.
     6.28.5.3. Purchase requests will be coordinated through Base Ground Safety. Utility carts pur-
     chased for use on Air Force installations will meet all safety requirements.
  6.28.6. Golf car and LSV purchase requests will be coordinated through Base Transportation to
  ensure:
     6.28.6.1. Owning organizations have made financial arrangements to procure all maintenance
     through purchase agreements or the IMPAC card. Maintenance will be performed according to
     manufacture specifications. Base Transportation manpower and facilities will not typically be
     used to maintain golf cars and LSVs, refer to AFI 24-302, Vehicle Maintenance Management.
     6.28.6.2. Owning organizations have made financial arrangements to ensure annual safety inspec-
     tions are completed every 12 months, according to utility cart manufacturers specifications. Base
     Transportation manpower and facilities will not be used to perform annual safety inspections.
  6.28.7. Salvage Procedures. Golf cars and LSVs will be processed for disposal by the owning unit in
  the same manner as local procedures dictate for disposal of other organizationally owned government
  equipment.

                                                 Chapter 7

              IDENTIFYING, MARKING, AND REGISTERING MOTOR VEHICLES

7.1. Prescribed Identification. Except for vehicles hired for 60 days or less, vehicles acquired for offi-
cial purposes are identified by specific markings (Title 40 U.S.C. 491). Specific marking instructions are
in T.O. 36-1-191. Identification consists of three parts:
     7.1.1. Title of DOD component.
     7.1.2. The registration number.
     7.1.3. The legend, “Official Use Only.”
NOTE: This legend must not be covered or blacked out with organizational markings.

7.2. Markings.
     7.2.1. Removing Markings. Remove all prescribed or authorized vehicle markings when the vehicle
     is permanently disposed of.
     7.2.2. Special Marking Procedures. Only a minimum number of special markings may be affixed to
     vehicles. For economical reasons, they must be removable to speed the rotation of vehicles. All
     markings must comply with T.O. 36-1-191.
     7.2.3. Installation and Activity Markings. T.O. 36-1-191 prescribes using Air Force installation,
     activity, or organizational markings.

7.3. Exemptions From Identification Markings. Vehicles which are exempt from DoD identification
markings as outlined in Chapter 11 shall be registered and inspected in accordance with the laws of the
State, Commonwealth, terrority or possession in which they are primarily used (41 CFR 101-38.201-2).
     7.3.1. Records of Exempt Vehicles. Each major command must keep a record of vehicles that are
     exempt from identification and marking. They must institute measures to ensure all vehicles are used
     for official purposes only.
NOTE: Executive sedans assigned to those officials listed in Chapter 5 must display official U.S. Gov-
ernment license plates.

7.4. Registration Numbers:
     7.4.1. Registration numbers are assigned to motor vehicles and designated non-motorized vehicular
     equipment. Vehicular equipment in Federal Stock Guides (FSG) 17, 23, 24, 38, and 39; Federal Stock
     Code (FSC) 4210, and Material Management Aggregation Codes (MMAC) CT and YW have regis-
     tration numbers. Registration numbers are also required for all Air Force activities (including the Air
     National Guard and the United States Air Force Reserve) that record vehicles on any type of property
     account.
     7.4.2. These vehicles do not require registration numbers:
        7.4.2.1. Any vehicular-type equipment in FSGs, FSCs, or MMACs not listed in paragraph 7.4.1.
        7.4.2.2. Non-self-propelled materiel handling equipment. Examples include two- or four-wheeled
        hand trucks, warehouse trailers, or hoists.
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                69


     7.4.2.3. Aerospace ground or hanger equipment. Examples include bomblift trailers,
     trailer-mounted air conditioners, and oxygen or nitrogen-servicing carts.
     7.4.2.4. Vehicle attachments. Examples include bulldozer and snowplow blades or refuse con-
     tainers.
     7.4.2.5. Non-motorized bicycles.
     7.4.2.6. Non-self-propelled agricultural implements.
     7.4.2.7. Mobile homes or house trailers.
     7.4.2.8. Vehicles earmarked for the Military Assistance Program (MAP).
  7.4.3. The vehicle IM at WR-ALC/LE assigns all REMS vehicle registration numbers. Registration
  numbers will be applied by vehicle maintenance as specified in T.O. 36-1-191.
  7.4.4. The owning base assigns local identification numbers for equipment listed in paragraph
  7.4.2.1. thru 7.4.2.8., or considered by the IM as not requiring REMS control. Local identification
  numbers are not reportable in REMS.
     7.4.4.1. Vehicles changed by modification to a different basic type must have old registration
     numbers canceled by the losing IM and new registration numbers assigned by the gaining IM.
     7.4.4.2. The responsible inventory manager obtains registration numbers for vehicular support
     equipment from WR-ALC/LE. These numbers must have an alpha “W” in the third position.
     They are not reportable in REMS.
  7.4.5. The base vehicle maintenance activity destroys license plates or obliterates registration num-
  bers according to T.O. 36-1-191 when vehicles are removed from the Air Force inventory and trans-
  ferred to:
     7.4.5.1. The Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO).
     7.4.5.2. Another agency for other than repair and return.
     7.4.5.3. A military assistance program.
     7.4.5.4. Conversion to a training aid.
  7.4.6. The VCO submits a request for a registration number to fleet management. The Fleet Manager
  forwards approved recommendations through the MAJCOM/LGTV to the appropriate IM at
  WR-ALC/LE for any vehicle that does not have a registration number but meets the above criteria. If
  doubt exists, Fleet Management will request a registration number. The IM either assigns the number
  or advises Fleet Management to assign a local identification number.
     7.4.6.1. Registration number requests will include stock number, description, model year or year
     of manufacture, and chassis serial number of the vehicle. AF Form 86, Request for Cataloging
     Data/Action, lists this information if the vehicle does not have a valid national stock number
     (NSN).
     7.4.6.2. Government license plates are applied to vehicles as soon as practicable after the receipt
     of registration numbers.
     7.4.6.3. When a new registration number is applied to a license plate and mounted on the vehicle,
     and entered on applicable vehicle records, a report is submitted to the IM.
70                                                     AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


     7.4.7. WR-ALC/LE:
        7.4.7.1. Assigns registration numbers or advises activities to assign local control numbers.
        7.4.7.2. Makes sure a current listing of reportable vehicle stock numbers is maintained.
        7.4.7.3. Makes sure that other Air Force publications citing definitions or registration techniques
        conform to this AFMAN.

7.5. General and Flag Officer Identification. Plates indicating the occupancy of a vehicle by a general
or flag officer are affixed to the front of the vehicle. In addition, Air Force commanders at the installation
group level or above and other persons as designated by MAJCOM commanders may display distinguish-
ing metal plates on their motor vehicles.

7.6. Vehicles in the District of Columbia. The 11 NCRSPTG/DOXL is the single point of contact with
the District of Columbia Government and GSA for registering, inspecting, and licensing motor vehicles in
the District of Columbia. Liaison representatives approve requests for regular District of Columbia tags
and other identification. The name and a file-signature of each liaison representative must be furnished
annually to the District of Columbia, Department of Highways and Traffic.
     7.6.1. Registration:
        7.6.1.1. All vehicles acquired for official use and regularly based or housed in the District of
        Columbia are registered with the District of Columbia, Department of Highways and Traffic,
        according to District of Columbia Code, Section 40-102(b)(2). Vehicles are re-registered during
        February of each year. Special forms for registering motor vehicles are available from the Depart-
        ment of Highways and Traffic, District of Columbia.
        7.6.1.2. The District of Columbia Code requires a certification of origin, bill of sale, or other doc-
        ument attesting to government ownership when requesting the registration and title. If these
        documents are misplaced, destroyed, or are otherwise unavailable, upon presentation of adequate
        proof of ownership, GSA Form 1020, US Government Certificate of Ownership, may be
        obtained from GSA, Transportation and Communication Services, Motor Equipment Division,
        General Services Building, Washington DC 20406. Shipping documents are acceptable. The
        District of Columbia will accept the GSA Form 1020, if GSA certifies the form, in lieu of mis-
        placed or destroyed documents.
        7.6.1.3. When vehicles regularly based in the District of Columbia are transferred to another
        agency, or removed from government service, the District of Columbia, Department of Highways
        and Traffic is advised.
     7.6.2. Annual Inspection:
     The District of Columbia Code, Section 40-204, exempts government-owned vehicles registered in
     the District of Columbia from annual inspection.
        7.6.2.1. The owning agency may perform an annual inspection using the official inspection
        record of the Department of Highways and Traffic of the District of Columbia.
        7.6.2.2. The completed report of inspection must be submitted to the Department of Highways
        and Traffic, District of Columbia, by the last day of the month, when the vehicle undergoes a
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                    71


       scheduled maintenance inspection. Since this record is frequently used by the courts as evidence,
       it must show the true condition of the vehicle before and after the inspection.
       7.6.2.3. The Director of Highways and Traffic, District of Columbia, does not issue an approved,
       rejected, or condemned sticker for a vehicle inspected by a DOD agency. These stickers are not

                                                 Chapter 8

                            QUALITY ASSURANCE EVALUATORS (QAE)

8.1. QAEs for the Vehicle Operations Flight. QAEs ensure contractors provide the services required
under the contract.

8.2. Duties of the QAE. The QAE ensures satisfactory performance of the technical area of the contract.
The base contracting officer provides guidance to determine if the contractor’s performance meets con-
tractual obligations. The QAE:
     8.2.1. Represents the contracting officer in all technical matters concerning the contract.
     8.2.2. Assists in developing and updating the Statement of Work (SOW), Performance Work State-
     ment (PWS), surveillance plans, and evaluation guides.
     8.2.3. Provides a monthly summary of QAE surveillance activities to the Contracting Officer.
     8.2.4. Certifies contractor invoices.
     8.2.5. Performs contract surveillance, evaluates and documents contractor performance.
     8.2.6. Submits contractor performance reports to the contract administrator in the frequency, format,
     and detail prescribed by the contracting officer.
     8.2.7. Reviews contractor’s quality control program.
     Periodically reviews contractor’s performance with the commander and contract administrator.
     8.2.8. Reviews and purges all incoming correspondence before routing it to the contractor.
     8.2.9. Reviews the contractor’s reports for accuracy, adverse trends and mission accomplishment.
     8.2.10. Reviews contractor reports submitted to higher headquarters.
     8.2.11. Reviews all contractor outgoing Air Force correspondence.
     8.2.12. Validates contractor technical order requirements.
     8.2.13. The QAE will not:
        8.2.13.1. Clarify, make, or infer legal interpretation on the scope or intent of the contract. Ques-
        tions pertaining to interpretation of any contract provisions shall be referred to the contracting
        officer for resolution.
        8.2.13.2. Approve contractor’s procedures.
        8.2.13.3. Authorize the expenditure of funds.
        8.2.13.4. Levy or impose upon a contractor any task or permit any substitution not specifically
        provided for in the contract.
        8.2.13.5. Enter into contractual agreements with the contractor.

AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                   73


8.3. Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP). An inspection plan is necessary to conduct proper
surveillance of a contractor. The plan should utilize the surveillance methods specified in the QASP.
Make modifications as necessary to meet unique situations.
   8.3.1. Use the QASP to evaluate the services provided by the contractor. The QASP provides for
   effective and efficient monitoring to ensure acceptable service. It provides data and a historical per-
   spective to evaluate performance. The surveillance plan includes:
       8.3.1.1. A Performance Requirement Summary which contains the necessary information to
       develop the plan.
       8.3.1.2. A Sampling Guide and Tally Checklist to describe and record random sampling sur-
       veillance.
       8.3.1.3. AF Form 779, Surveillance Activity Checklist, to inspect periodic items as specified in
       the performance requirement summary.
       8.3.1.4. AF Form 714, Customer Complaint Record, to record customer complaints and docu-
       ment unacceptable contractor services.
NOTE: Use AF Form 801, Quality Assurance Evaluator Schedule, to implement the plan. Provide a
copy of the plan to the contracting officer.
       8.3.1.5. Application of the QASP. The QAE performs the surveillance according to the QASP.
       Document satisfactory or unsatisfactory job tasks on tally checklists. Satisfactory performance is
       determined by performance criteria in the contract which specifies an acceptable quality level.
       Unacceptable performance is brought to the attention of the contractor, and the QAE prepares an
       AF Form 802, Contract Discrepancy Report. The QAE uses subjective judgment and criteria
       set out in a “decision table” to determine unacceptable levels of performance. Provide the report
       to the contracting officer who can initiate action against the contractor. The objective of the QASP
       is to ensure acceptable performance, good quality control, and a beneficial contract for the Air
       Force.

8.4. Surveillance Methods. The first source of information for a contract surveillance function is the
Management Information System. The purpose of having an information system is to collect data to iden-
tify problems in the work area. The data is useful to both the contractor and the QAE, but since data is
mostly supplied by the contractor, the system should not be relied on exclusively to evaluate performance.
   8.4.1. Random Inspection/Sampling. Random inspections to evaluate performance provides the
   QAE with a valuable management tool. Random samplings provides good overall performance indi-
   cators. Each job is evaluated in detail and the level of performance recorded. The critical element in
   a random sampling evaluation is that the samplings taken are truly random and they depict the true
   average performance.
   8.4.2. Checklists. The checklist system is an easy method to identify the routine functions of the con-
   tractor’s activities. Prepare initial checklists from previously existing inspection guidelines and spe-
   cific provisions in the contract. Review and modify the checklist as necessary to ensure accuracy and
   currency.
   8.4.3. Customer Complaints. The QAE can use customer complaints to identify potential problem
   areas. The QAE must respond quickly to the customer complaint with an objective evaluation. Feed-
   back and involvement with the dissatisfied customer is key if the complaint system is to have validity.

8.5. QAE Administrative Duties. The QAE will maintain an organized filing system. Records are sub-
ject to inspection/review by the IG and auditors, etc., and can be used in litigation to support either the
government or contractor positions in disputes.
     8.5.1. QAE File Content. QAEs will establish and maintain a contract surveillance file for each
     active service contract. The file normally contains the following as applicable:
        8.5.1.1. A duplicate copy of the QAE appointment letter signed by the contracting officer.
        8.5.1.2. A copy of the contract with attachments, special reports from the contractor, and any
        technical specifications.
        8.5.1.3. A copy of all modifications to the contract. Modifications are executed on a SF 30,
        Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of Contract. Amendments to solicitations become
        part of the contract.
        8.5.1.4. Copies of all receipt and acceptance documents.
        8.5.1.5. Correspondence to and from the contracting officer and contractor. This correspondence
        should include special instructions from the contracting officer, interpretation of the terms and
        conditions of the contract from the contracting officer, clarification of specifications to the con-
        tractor, or questions on interpretations of terms, conditions, and specifications from the contractor.
        8.5.1.6. A copy of any memoranda for the record to document:
        8.5.1.7. Telephone conversations with the contractor’s representative and the contracting officer.
        8.5.1.8. Pre-work or pre-performance conference meetings.
        8.5.1.9. Any other conversations or meetings with the contractor or contracting officer.
        8.5.1.10. Records of the contractor’s inspection system, if obtained from the contractor.
        8.5.1.11. Records of inspections describing how, when, and where the inspections are accom-
        plished and the results of those inspections.
        8.5.1.12. Samples, photographs, witness statements, and other factual data to support documenta-
        tion.
        8.5.1.13. Records of unusual conditions that could delay performance of a provision of the con-
        tract.
        8.5.1.14. Names of individuals who are functioning as technical and administrative assistants.
        8.5.1.15. Applicable test reports, data required by the contract, AF Forms 9, Request for Pur-
        chase, and funding obligations for the contract.
        8.5.1.16. A copy of the surveillance plan.
        8.5.1.17. A copy of all forms and letters containing surveillance and evaluation data applicable to
        the contract(s).
     8.5.2. Disposition of QAE Files. The QAE forwards all records to the contracting officer.
     8.5.3. Suspense Files. A suspense system will be established to advise the contracting officer of the
     contractor’s failure to complete acceptable performance or delivery in accordance with the contract
     schedule or provisions.

8.6. Contract Administration. The QAE has certain lines of authority and responsibilities to be familiar
with. The following are the primary functions/personnel the QAE will routinely deal with:
   8.6.1. Functional Area Chief (FAC). The FAC is a functional director or commander of any func-
   tional area with government program management responsibility for contracted services which pro-
   vide some or all of the functional mission. For example, for Transportation, the squadron commander
   is the functional area chief. They are generally responsible for:
       8.6.1.1. Developing and sustaining a sound Quality Assurance Evaluation Program (QAEP).
       8.6.1.2. Implementing the QASP.
       Establishing a comprehensive training program.
       8.6.1.3. Developing the SOW or PWS surveillance plans and evaluation guides.
   8.6.2. The Contract Administrator. A qualified contracting individual that the contracting officer
   appoints to administer a particular contract.
   8.6.3. The Contracting Officer. The Air Force agent empowered to award and/or administer con-
   tracts. The Contracting officer acts as an agent between the Air Force and the contractor. The con-
   tracting officer is the only person authorized to enter into contracts and is responsible for reviewing
   the contractor’s performance to ensure that it is satisfactory and that the Air Force receives the prod-
   ucts and/or services requested.

                                                Chapter 9

                                       BUS TRANSPORTATION

9.1. Bus Transportation Services. The Air Force provides bus service for official purposes and as the
law allows. The Air Force operates enough buses to effectively support the mission. The capability to
transport groups of people on official business reduces the requirement for small passenger-carrying vehi-
cles. Do not provide this service to nonessential activities when private or commercial transportation is
available. The availability of vehicles and operators may limit military support. This chapter describes
the categories of bus service the Air Force is authorized by statute to provide.

9.2. Group Transportation Service (10 U.S.C. 2632). This is a fare-charging service which requires a
vehicle with a minimum of 12 passenger seats to transport military and civilian employees. This service
provides domicile-to-duty transportation from other than government installations. For example, an
installation that is located so far from the source of manpower that government assistance is necessary to
make sure personnel have adequate transportation. Another example is a situation where an overseas area
does not have adequate public or private transportation, or where local political situations, security, per-
sonal safety, or geographic locations of duty stations make this transportation essential to conduct Air
Force business. Each MAJCOM or field operating agency (FOA) reviews operational data annually to
ensure continued service is justified. Provide a certification of review completion, the results of the
review, and a current list of locations to HQ USAF/ILTV by 1 November each year (RCA: HAF-ILT(A)
8103, Annual Group Transportation Review Certificate). This report is designated emergency status code
D. Immediately discontinue reporting data requirements during emergency conditions. Discontinue
reporting during MINIMIZE. The use of government-owned buses, contractor-owned buses, leasing or
chartering equipment to private or public carriers is authorized under terms approved by HQ USAF/ILT.
     9.2.1. To Establish Group Transportation Service:
        9.2.1.1. Submit requests through command transportation channels to HQ USAF/ILT for
        approval. Requests must include the following information:
        9.2.1.2. The name, mission, and location of the activity.
        9.2.1.3. The current military and civilian strength and any authorized changes that might affect
        transportation requirements to include a breakdown of shifts if necessary.
        9.2.1.4. A description of existing transportation available including the use of privately owned
        vehicles, car pools, and group riding arrangements.
        9.2.1.5. Location where the service is required and the distance between the installation and each
        point.
        9.2.1.6. The number of people requiring recurring transportation between the installation and
        each point. Estimates based on customer surveys are acceptable for establishing a new service.
        9.2.1.7. A statement describing any efforts to make existing transportation (public or private) ade-
        quate and any effort to induce private operators to provide the required service.
        9.2.1.8. The type of service proposed and pertinent information about arrangements such as rent-
        als, charters, rates, routes, and schedules. Include the type, source, number, and seating capacity
        of the equipment to be used. Enclose a fare quote and a map of the area. The request must indi-
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                      77


       cate that local commercial carriers do not have a desire nor the capacity to provide the service if
       government vehicles will perform the service.
       9.2.1.9. A statement of appropriated funds availability to operate the service.
       9.2.1.10. The proposed start date.

9.3. Military Mass Transit Service (10 U.S.C. 2632). A fare-charging bus service that provides domi-
cile-to-duty transportation on military installations or between subinstallations within the established
POD. It may be used to provide service to and from on-base domiciles, on-base shopping areas, or instal-
lation recreation areas on a routine basis if the traffic volume warrants. Review services provided every 6
months to ensure the fare schedule is adequate to recover the costs. For audit purposes retain these
reviews for 3 years.
   9.3.1. To Establish Mass Transportation Service:
       9.3.1.1. The MAJCOM must determine that:
       9.3.1.2. A potential exists for saving energy and reducing air pollution.
       9.3.1.3. A reasonable effort was made to induce local public or private firms to provide the ser-
       vice.
       9.3.1.4. The service utilizes transportation assets properly and efficiently.
       9.3.1.5. If the MAJCOM validates that the service may produce fuel economies and a reduction in
       pollution, it may:
       9.3.1.6. Rent or lease motor vehicles. Compute the fare to recover all rental and lease costs
       including contract administration costs, salaries, operations and maintenance.
       9.3.1.7. Program procurement of vehicles to support mass transportation. When assets are pur-
       chased specifically and exclusively for mass transit, a fare must be charged to recover all acquisi-
       tion costs.
       9.3.1.8. Lease or charter vehicles from private or public carriers. Costs must be recovered in the
       fare system.
   9.3.2. The installation commander requests authority to establish a mass transit service to the MAJ-
   COM transportation staff. Include the following information:
       9.3.2.1. The name, mission, and location of the activity. Show the relationship of the main instal-
       lation to the sub-installations. Military leased housing areas located off the installation are consid-
       ered subinstallations. This does not include housing privately leased by DoD employees or
       military members.
       9.3.2.2. The number of persons to use the service. Persons authorized to use this service include
       active duty military, DoD, or other government civilian employees working on the installation;
       contractor employees working on the installation in overseas areas; and dependents living, work-
       ing, having business on the installation, or attending school on the installation where school bus
       travel is not authorized.
       9.3.2.3. A description of the existing transportation services including privately owned vehicles,
       private or commercial transportation, car pools, and group riding arrangements. Include any
       potential for saving energy and reducing air pollution.
78                                                      AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


         9.3.2.4. A definition of the locations where service is required. Use the most direct route of travel
         between sub-installations consistent with safe operations.
         9.3.2.5. A statement indicating the service does not compete with commercial enterprises in the
         area.
         9.3.2.6. The type of service proposed and information about all necessary arrangements such as
         rates and methods of computation, routes, schedules, and seating capacities of the vehicles. State
         the proposed fare and include a map of the route.

9.4. Military Mass Transit Service for Isolated Areas (10 U.S.C. 2632). T h i s s e r v i c e p r o v i d e s
no-fare bus transportation (12 passenger or more) service for locations designated as an isolated area. Iso-
lated areas are those locations not adequately serviced by regularly scheduled commercial or municipal
transit services. Provide transportation to military members, DoD civilians, contractors, and their depen-
dents. Consider CONUS locations as isolated areas only under unique circumstances. Forward requests
for CONUS locations through command transportation channels to HQ USAF/ILT for approval. For
overseas commands, forward requests to the MAJCOM LGT for approval. Requests for both CONUS
and overseas will include the same information as requested in paragraph 9.3.1. Reporting and review
procedures as outlined in paragraph 9.3. apply.

9.5. Emergency Bus Service (10 U.S.C. 2632). This is a fare-charging bus service for military and
DoD civilian personnel during public transportation strikes or transportation stoppages. Establish this
service to support projects when a continued delay would adversely affect national defense. Transporta-
tion for routine workloads such as constructing, repairing, or overhauling aircraft, ships, or materiel pecu-
liar to the military departments does not qualify under this policy. When public transportation strikes are
imminent or in progress, commanding officers who determine that transportation between domiciles and
places of employment is essential must submit the following information through MAJCOM transporta-
tion channels to HQ USAF/ILT for authority:
     9.5.1. The name of the installation or activity requiring transportation support.
     9.5.2. The general nature of the transportation requirements, including any efforts to induce private
     transportation companies to provide this transportation.
     9.5.3. The titles of critical projects.
     9.5.4. The availability, type, and number of vehicles required.
     9.5.5. The number of personnel, by project, to be transported.
     9.5.6. The proposed fares.

9.6. Fares and Proceeds. Figure 9.1. describes how to compute a reasonable fare. Accounting and
Finance (ACF) and LGT will determine how to account for and deposit fares and proceeds. As a general
rule, return proceeds to transportation O & M accounts for unfunded support. Deposit proceeds in the
U.S. Treasury, as “Miscellaneous Receipts,” according to Air Force finance AFIs, when transportation
budgets for support. Recover only costs directly related to category of transportation provided if the vehi-
cle supports both operational (mission) and group/mass transportation. In overseas areas only, the fare
may not exceed the fare charged by commercial municipal transportation (if such transportation were
available).
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                  79


9.7. Shuttle Bus Service (10 U.S.C. 2632). Provide shuttle bus service using DoD-owned or contract
vehicles with expenses paid from appropriated funds. Use the most efficient vehicles to accommodate
duty passengers. Conduct semiannual surveys to ensure the service remains valid.
   9.7.1. Authorized Users. Shuttle bus service provides support on or between installations for trans-
   porting:
       9.7.1.1. Military personnel and DoD employees between offices and work areas of the installation
       or activity during normal duty hours. Routes will service offices and work centers only. Unautho-
       rized stops include base housing areas (to include government leased housing) and any recre-
       ational or shopping areas unless these areas are reasonably unavoidable. Domicile-to-duty
       transportation using a shuttle service is not authorized.
       9.7.1.2. Enlisted personnel residing in dormitories, between the dormitory and work areas when
       they are required to support the defense mission. Do not provide this service when other forms of
       transportation such as mass transit, privately owned conveyance, or car or van pools are adequate
       to meet the needs of the member. The installation commander makes these determinations.
       9.7.1.3. Employees from non-DoD Federal agencies conducting official business. Do not alter
       established (mission) routes to support these people.
NOTE: DoD contractor personnel conducting official defense business. Domicile-to-duty transportation
is not authorized.
   9.7.2. Space-Available Transportation. The following categories of passengers may use shuttle-bus
   services on a space-available (Space A) basis only. Do not change the size of vehicle required to sup-
   port active duty personnel to accommodate space A personnel.
       9.7.2.1. Off-duty military personnel or DoD civilian employees.
       9.7.2.2. United States Reserve and Air National Guard members.
       9.7.2.3. Dependents of active duty personnel.
       9.7.2.4. Retirees.
       9.7.2.5. Visitors to the base (intra-installation only).
   9.7.3. Shuttle Bus Service in Support of TDY Personnel and Transient Air Crews. Establish special
   shuttle bus services at installations to accommodate large numbers of TDY personnel and transient
   aircrews when the service would be the most cost effective and efficient support. The following
   guidelines apply:
       9.7.3.1. Transportation Squadron Commander must approve the service.
       9.7.3.2. Limit designated stops to those specified in the Federal Travel regulations (U3200 and
       C2050).
       9.7.3.3. Analyze this service semiannually using criteria specified in Chapter 2.

9.8. Services Support. Bus transportation in support of DoD-authorized services programs or family
service center (FSC) programs may be provided when such transportation can be made available without
detriment to the DoD mission. This support is limited to bus transportation only unless specifically noted
otherwise. The installation commander is the approval authority for this type of transportation support.
When available, NAF and/or commercial transportation sources will be used. All requests must be coor-
80                                                     AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


dinated with the installation Transportation and Services. Such services cannot be provided for domi-
cile-to-duty transport. Additionally, it is subject to the following restrictions:
     9.8.1. The following are examples of general mass transportation services that are routinely provided
     when it can be made available without detriment to the mission:
        9.8.1.1. Nonreimbursable.
            9.8.1.1.1. Command or base varsity teams composed of personnel who officially represent the
            installation in scheduled events.
            9.8.1.1.2. Military personnel or dependent spectators attending local events in which a com-
            mand or base-sponsored team is participating.
            9.8.1.1.3. Entertainers, guests, and their supplies and equipment essential to morale and wel-
            fare programs. NOTE: Use of utility type vehicles for cargo movements is authorized.
            9.8.1.1.4. Civilian groups transported to military installations in the interest of community
            relations when officially invited by the installation commander or other competent authority.
            9.8.1.1.5. Base sponsored tours and trips when operated on a nonprofit basis. Assets may be
            used only after mission requirements have been met.
NOTE: Use of utility type vehicles is authorized.
            9.8.1.1.6. Scouting programs (Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America) operating at U.S. mil-
            itary installations located overseas.
            9.8.1.1.7. Child development center sponsored activities when vehicles and personnel are
            available without detriment to the mission.
        9.8.1.2. Reimbursable. Transportation may be provided to MWR/NAF category C revenue gen-
        erating organizations. Such service shall be accomplished on a reimbursable basis. A fare, using
        the formula in Figure 9.1. is charged for all operations and maintenance costs. Do not use vehicle
        acquisition costs when determining the fare.
     9.8.2. Categories of NAF Programs. Refer to AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support Of Morale,
     Welfare, And Recreation And Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, for information on activities
     by category.
     9.8.3. Specific guidance for supporting Private Organizations can be found in AFI 34-233, Private
     Organizations (PO) Program. Private organizations generally do not get either NAF or APF support.

9.9. Transporting Dependent School Children in the United States. These policies apply to all DoD
dependent students who attend schools in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
     9.9.1. Authorities. There are two distinct authorities for providing this transportation:
        9.9.1.1. Public Law 81-874, as amended. In consideration for federal assistance to local educa-
        tion agencies providing education for children residing on federal property, the agencies that pro-
        vide transportation to school children in their districts shall provide transportation to children
        residing on Air Force installations located within their school districts. If transportation is pro-
        vided for local students but not Air Force dependent students, the Air Force may provide transpor-
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                 81


     tation to those students. The cost of providing this transportation may be sought from the local
     education agency pursuant to Department of Education procedures.
     9.9.1.2. Title 10 U.S.C. 2639, authorizes each military department to provide funds specifically
     appropriated for the transportation of military dependents between their school and the military
     installation when schools are not accessible by regular means of transportation. Provide support
     when an appropriate official of the local education agency advises the school district will not pro-
     vide school transportation. Once these requirements are met, the installation commander forwards
     a letter to the Transportation Squadron Commander indicating that transporting school children is
     authorized. Provide the most economical, efficient service using government owned, leased, or
     contracted bus service. Revalidate the commander’s letter annually through the local school dis-
     trict.
  9.9.2. Provide transportation to:
     9.9.2.1. Local public schools when the school is not accessible.
     9.9.2.2. Nearby public schools, other than the local public schools, when either the nearby
     schools are not accessible or when the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) determines that local
     public schools where children would normally attend are unable to adequately provide for their
     education and that attendance at other public schools (to include public schools for the handi-
     capped) in a nearby school district can be arranged and that the transportation cannot be provided
     as described above.
  9.9.3. Note that each child may make one trip to and one trip from the school per day.
  9.9.4. The dominant user coordinates transportation arrangements to minimize transportation
  resources involving more than one DoD installation.
  9.9.5. The walking distance between residence and school or between residence and designated bus
  stop is established for dependent children by the local public school authority.
  9.9.6. To make connections with a regular means of transportation, children may use available, regu-
  larly scheduled DoD transportation within and between installations when they travel to and from
  school. Similarly, provide special transportation within the installation if this will serve to make
  schools accessible by a regular means of transportation.
  9.9.7. Develop written agreements that specify the services and support provided (include reimburse-
  ment procedures) to local education agencies when it is necessary for the Air Force to provide trans-
  portation for dependents to public schools or to schools operated on DoD installations.
  9.9.8. Credit reimbursement costs to applicable appropriations. Reimbursement costs consist of all
  costs of; operations, maintenance, depreciation of equipment, and compensation costs of the drivers
  directly engaged in providing the service. The DoD Accounting Manual, DoD 7220.9-M (Ref. D)
  Chapter 26 governs reimbursement.
     9.9.8.1. For civilian drivers, compute the compensation cost on the basis of their gross payroll
     compensation, plus a factor of 29 percent of their gross payroll compensation for fringe benefits.
     9.9.8.2. For military operators, compute the compensation cost on the basis of the reimbursement
     rates for military personnel accelerated by the factors specified by the local finance officer.

     9.9.9. Transportation may be provided to private or parochial schools within a reasonable distance
     when:
        9.9.9.1. The private school is not accessible by a regular means of transportation and private
        school transportation, (either with or without cost to the member) is not available; and the parent
        of a child submits a written request for transportation to the head of the installation    (Do not
        approve requests to avoid transportation costs to the member).
        9.9.9.2. The installation commander may approve transportation support when one of the follow-
        ing conditions exist:
            9.9.9.2.1. The public schools available in the locality are inadequate for the educational wel-
            fare of the children concerned. An adequate education is considered one that meets the State
            certification and regional accreditation requirements.
            9.9.9.2.2. The vehicle used for transporting dependent children to public schools has extra
            space and can transport the child attending private or parochial schools without materially
            deviating from the established route, or
            9.9.9.2.3. The DoD installation is so remotely located that the private school is not accessible
            by regular means of transportation.
        9.9.9.3. Upon validation of student transportation requirements by the installation commander:
            9.9.9.3.1. Military in-house transportation resources must be used to the maximum extent
            possible.
            9.9.9.3.2. If funds are available, installation commanders may authorize commercial transpor-
            tation when in-house transportation resources are not available. Each commercial contract
            must contain an agreement by the contractor to furnish the service without discrimination on
            the grounds of race, creed, color, sex, or national origin. The MAJCOM/FOA Director of
            Transportation must approve all requests and subsequent changes.
     9.9.10. Use vehicles for other official transportation needs when not transporting students.
     9.9.11. Normally, military transportation using part-time drivers is used except when it is more eco-
     nomical to use commercial contract transportation services, based on comparative cost analysis of
     in-house versus commercial contract school bus service.
     9.9.12. Exceptions to General Policy. The installation or community commander may make excep-
     tions to the school routes when the existing route is through areas of heavy traffic, blighted urban or
     residential districts, or potentially dangerous construction, industrial areas, or during severe weather
     conditions. All other exceptions require Secretary of the Air Force approval. The installation com-
     mander must send requests, with full justification, through the MAJCOM or FOA LGT to HQ USAF/
     ILT.

9.10. Transporting Dependent School Children in Overseas Areas. These policies apply to all stu-
dents attending DoD-operated or non-DoD schools located outside the United States.
     9.10.1. Authority. The Secretary of Defense may establish and operate a program to provide a free
     public education, through secondary schools, for dependents in overseas areas per 20 U.S.C. 921.
     This authorization includes the provision of any necessary incidental services.
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                     83


  9.10.2. Commuting Area:
     9.10.2.1. The DoD Education Activity (DoDEA) Area Transportation Management Office estab-
     lishes a commuting area to determine eligibility for transportation at each DoDDS school. This
     area is based on availability of adequate housing within the proximity of the school, DoDEA com-
     muting distance policy, and available resources. Elapsed travel time from the farthest point within
     the commuting area should not exceed 1-hour unless waived by the Chief, DoDEA Area Transpor-
     tation Management Office. The commuting area does not have to be equidistant in all directions
     from the school, nor must it be as far as 1-hour commuting time if sufficient adequate housing is
     available within a closer distance. If a locality otherwise within the commuting area has difficult
     or unsafe access (e.g., during the winter), it should be excluded from the commuting area.
     9.10.2.2. The installation or community commander will give the commuting area widespread
     publicity during incoming personnel processing, Housing Referral Officer visits, sponsor pro-
     grams, etc., so every sponsor is well informed before looking for family housing.
     9.10.2.3. The installation or community commander will ensure that all incoming sponsors certify
     in writing that they are aware of the commuting area and understand that, if they choose to live in
     housing outside the commuting area, they are responsible for transportation of dependent students
     between their home and the school or an existing stop within the commuting area.
  9.10.3. Walking Area. The DoDEA Area Transportation Management Office also establishes a walk-
  ing area for each school. Normally, walking distance to a school or bus stop should not exceed 1 mile
  for students in kindergarten to grade 6 and 1.5 miles for students in grades 7-12. Walking areas are
  expanded and contracted to conform to the natural boundaries such as a housing area, neighborhood,
  etc. Do not provide transportation to students within the walking area except for students with disabil-
  ities when required by their Individual Education Plan (IEP).
  9.10.4. Authorized Transportation. In many areas, the DoDEA Area Transportation Management
  Office manages school bus service. The following policies apply where the Air Force provides school
  bus services.
     9.10.4.1. DoD Operated Schools:
         9.10.4.1.1. Provide one round-trip between family residential areas and DoDDS schools for
         dependent students who reside outside the walking area and within the commuting area (or
         who are transported at the sponsor’s expense to an existing bus stop within the commuting
         area) of a DoDDS. Do not provide a second round trip to/from home for lunch. Establish cen-
         trally located school bus stops in the area of student residences and/or alternate care providers,
         such as a Child Development Center within the commuting area. Provide curb-to-curb service
         only for students with disabilities when required by their IEP.
         9.10.4.1.2. Provide commuting transportation to non-federally connected space-available stu-
         dents on existing routes only if space is available on the route(s) to be used. Do not provide
         commuter passes or bus tickets instead of transportation in kind to non-federally connected
         students.
         9.10.4.1.3. Provide transportation to students participating in school-sponsored educational
         activities such as field trips if vehicles and operators are available and support will not conflict
         with mission support requirements.
84                                                     AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


            9.10.4.1.4. Provide transportation for students participating in voluntary after-school activi-
            ties (e.g. sports programs) from the school to a limited number of central locations, such as
            major housing areas and public transportation terminals, as approved by school officials and
            subject to the availability of funds, vehicles, and drivers.
        9.10.4.2. Non-DoD Schools.
            9.10.4.2.1. Students who attend a non-DoD school at DoD expense and who reside beyond
            the walking distance of the non-DoD school shall use transportation provided or arranged by
            the non-DoD school when included as part of the tuition fee. When non-DoD schools do not
            provide transportation, or when the cost of providing transportation is charged separately, the
            Chief, DoDDS Area Service Center, will determine the proper transportation.
            9.10.4.2.2. Provide transportation to dependent students of DoD military or civilian personnel
            who attend non-DoD schools in overseas areas at no expense to the U.S. Government only
            when such attendance has been approved by the DoDDS Area Superintendent.
        9.10.4.3. Special Education Transportation. Place special emphasis on meeting the transportation
        needs of students with disabilities. The installation must provide equitable transportation to these
        students. The Chief, DoDEA Area Transportation Management Office, after consultation with the
        base Transportation Squadron Commander will determine the most cost effective method of trans-
        porting students with disabilities (e.g. conventional Government vehicles, modification of existing
        Government vehicles, lease, or contract support).
            9.10.4.3.1. Provide commuting transportation to special education students who reside within
            walking distance of the school or bus stop or at any distance within the commuting area, when
            the nature of their handicap so dictates, as documented in the IEP.
            9.10.4.3.2. Provide any special transportation services prescribed by the Case Study Commit-
            tee (CSC) of the receiving school. Examples of special services include, but are not limited to,
            curb-to-curb service, a special bus stop within an IEP-specified distance of the student’s resi-
            dence, use of special harness or child seat, transportation of a seeing eye or hearing dog, or a
            one-on-one safety attendant for medically fragile or physically aggressive children.
            9.10.4.3.3. Ensure that all vehicles transporting special education students are equipped with
            a seat belt for each passenger.
            9.10.4.3.4. Provide a safety attendant who is trained to assist students with disabilities for all
            vehicles transporting more than two special education students or transporting any student
            requiring a special four point harness. Ensure that vehicles used to transport students who nor-
            mally use wheelchairs are equipped with a lifting device or ramp which can be secured to the
            vehicle and are equipped with approved wheelchair restraining devices.
NOTE: Before providing transportation to special education students for whom a safety attendant is
required, the Chief Dispatcher and the vehicle operator must ensure trained personnel are available to
accompany those students during travel.
     9.10.5. Transportation Resources. Students shall be transported at the lowest practical cost to the
     U.S. Government.
        9.10.5.1. Periodic Review. The DoDEA Area Transportation Management Office will analyze
        transportation services regularly, in coordination with the base Transportation Squadron Com-
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                85


     mander. Analysis will include a thorough review of student demand, school bus routes, and
     schedules, and will consider the following factors:
        9.10.5.1.1. Staggering school operating hours to permit buses to operate multiple trips per
        day.
        9.10.5.1.2. Altering school organization plans and establishing flexible school boundaries to
        maximize transportation resources.
        9.10.5.1.3. Consolidating school closures for administrative activities (meetings, training,
        conferences, etc.) to avoid half-day sessions and scheduling these activities to coincide with
        host nations’ holidays whenever possible.
        9.10.5.1.4. Developing routes and schedules to optimize the use of buses and seating capacity
        and to reduce total mileage and driving time. Use the projected number of space-required stu-
        dents as the basis for routes. Do not use larger capacity vehicles to accommodate space A stu-
        dents or other ineligible passengers.
        9.10.5.1.5. Allowing students in kindergarten through grade 6 to ride three to a bench seat on
        trips of 30 minutes or less.
        9.10.5.1.6. Using part time employees for in-house operations whenever possible.
        9.10.5.1.7. Requiring students in grades 7-12 to use regular public or DoD transportation
        (e.g., base shuttle buses) where available, feasible, and cost-efficient. DoDDS would reim-
        burse for this service if student use resulted in direct costs increase to the military.
     9.10.5.2. Economic Cost Analysis. Determine the most economical means of providing school
     bus services through in-depth comparative analysis of in-house to contract operations. Analysis
     must consider the overall cost to the Government of providing school bus transportation with DoD
     vehicles. Use commercial contract vendors to provide transportation support to DoDDS schools
     when it is determined to be more economical. Otherwise, use military transportation, with
     part-time drivers when possible. Integrate school busing with other installation mass transporta-
     tion functions whenever reasonable to do so. Include equipment acquisition costs as a factor in the
     cost analysis. However, DoDDS shall not be required to reimburse the Air Force for Govern-
     ment-owned equipment, acquisition costs, or amortization of these equipment costs, or for lease,
     rental, or other equipment usage costs when the underlying cost analysis has indicated that the
     leased equipment is less costly than the government-owned equipment. Conduct an economic
     cost analysis in accordance with DoD Instruction 7041.3 under any of the following circum-
     stances:.
        9.10.5.2.1. When arranging for initial transportation services to a new school or before chang-
        ing from existing military transportation to contract transportation.
        9.10.5.2.2. When the number of contractors is insufficient to ensure competitive bids for
        transportation services to schools currently serviced by contract transportation.
        9.10.5.2.3. When requested by the Chief, DoDEA Area Transportation Management Office.
     9.10.5.3. Proposed Changes to Services. Base Commanders shall coordinate with the Chief,
     DoDEA Area Transportation Management Office, on any significant proposed change to school
     bus services. The concurrence of the Chief, Area Transportation Management Office, or designee,
     shall be obtained before implementing any such change. All documentation associated with the
86                                                     AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


        provision of school bus services, e.g., cost studies, solicitation packages and amendments thereto,
        shall be provided to DoDDS upon request.
     9.10.6. Bus Safety and Security.
        9.10.6.1. Student Conduct. The DoDEA has developed standards of behavior for students riding
        school buses and guidelines for disciplinary actions when students misbehave on buses.
            9.10.6.1.1. Installation/community commanders must ensure that students and their parents/
            guardians/sponsors know what the standards of student behavior aboard school buses are
            before the school year begins. School bus riding is a privilege which may be withdrawn if a
            student misbehaves.
            9.10.6.1.2. At bases where the installation commander has retained primary responsibility for
            school buses passenger management, the commander will apply the guidelines established by
            DoDEA so the consequences of misconduct are applied equitably throughout the overseas
            area.
        9.10.6.2. Safety Reviews. Installation/community commanders must conduct periodic safety
        reviews of school buses and loading and unloading areas. Ensure that any contracts for school bus
        services contain a provision permitting similar safety reviews of contractor vehicles and services.
        9.10.6.3. School Bus Monitors. Do not hire, or contract for, school bus monitors to maintain
        order on the bus except where required by host nation statute.
        9.10.6.4. Safety Attendants. The Chief, DoDEA Area Transportation Management Office, may
        authorize school bus safety attendants for vehicles transporting special education students or vehi-
        cles transporting only kindergarten through grade 2 students. Duties of a safety attendant are to
        ensure that children enter and exit the school buses safely and/or to assist students with disabili-
        ties. Normally, only one adult other than the driver shall be assigned to a vehicle. Where drivers
        speak English, safety attendants are authorized only when required for special education buses.
        9.10.6.5. Security Personnel. When the installation/community commander deems that local
        conditions jeopardize the security of school bus services, the commander may place appropriately
        trained security personnel aboard those buses. Security personnel will not concern themselves
        with passenger conduct. DoDDS funds will not be used for this purpose.
        9.10.6.6. Contingency Plans. Installation/community commanders shall work with appropriate
        DoDDS officials to develop and publish contingency plans for transporting students. Ensure that
        overall base contingency plans for natural disaster, bomb threat, etc. include DoDDS schools and
        student transportation.
     9.10.7. Exceptions for Commuting Area or Walking Distance. The Chief, DoDEA Area Transporta-
     tion Management Office, may grant exceptions to the commuting area or walking distance criteria
     after considering circumstances and alternatives. Requests for exceptions are initiated by the installa-
     tion or community commander, endorsed by the local concerned principal and the DODDS District
     Superintendent and forwarded to the Chief, DoDEA Area Transportation Management Office.
     Waiver requests will address:
        9.10.7.1. Name of the school.
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                       87


          9.10.7.2. Reason for the waiver request. When safety considerations are a factor, include a state-
          ment of verification from the base safety officer. The base safety officer reviews and certifies
          these conditions annually.
          9.10.7.3. Statement of alternatives that may eliminate or alter the conditions requiring a waiver,
          i.e., construction of sidewalks or pedestrian overpass, installation of traffic lights, or use of the
          crossing guards.
          9.10.7.4. The number of students involved.
          9.10.7.5. Impact if the waiver is not approved.
          9.10.7.6. Budgetary impact if the waiver is granted.
          9.10.7.7. Comments and recommendations from endorsing officials.

Figure 9.1. Two-Step Method for Computing Reimbursement and Bus Fares.

                         COMPUTING REIMBURSEMENT AND BUS FARES
Step 1:
(Operator Cost ¥ Hours Worked) + (Total Miles ¥ Vehicle Cost) = Cost of Trip

EXAMPLE: E-4 ($12.84 per hour) required for 8 hours, driving 250 miles. Cost per mile (.47) is an esti-
mate for a 28 passenger bus.

                 $12.48 x 8 (hours) = $ 99.84
                  250 (miles) x .47 = $117.50
                 Total cost of the trip: $217.34
Step 2:
Cost of Trip __________________________ = Fare Per Person


Number of Passenger Seats
EXAMPLE: (28 Passenger Bus)
                                                     $217.34
                                                                 = $7.76 (Per Person)
                                                       28

NOTES:
             1. If total costs are all that is required, step two need not be computed.
             2. Use the average number of passengers transported to determine the fare per person for
                mass transit.

NOTE: Formula Interpretations:
       a. Determine vehicle operator cost using the average hourly pay for the operator, multiplied times
the number of hours necessary to complete the transportation. Use a rate for an E-4 (obtain most current
rate from local accounting & finance office) when an average cost is required.
      b. Determine the vehicle cost by obtaining the annual fleet average direct cost per mile for a partic-
ular vehicle type from OLVIMS data. Multiply the average direct cost by the number of miles driven to
determine the total cost for the transportation. In the example, a 28-passenger school bus (management
code B119) is used with an average cost per mile of 47 cents.
      c. Include all mileage driven to support the fare transportation in the computation. For example, if
the vehicle travels 10 miles to pick up the first passenger, include that mileage in the computation.
     d. An operator cost is not charged if an off-duty volunteer drives the vehicle.

                               INTERSERVICE VEHICLE SUPPORT

10.1. Interservice Support. Interservice support among DOD components will be used where econo-
mies can be realized without impairing mission effectiveness. DOD Directive 400.19R, Interservice,
Interdepartmental and Interagency Support, implements DoD policy concerning interservice support. As
a rule, the DOD component having the greater area of responsibility (equipment and manpower) furnishes
the support requested to the extent capabilities and military commitments permit.

10.2. Arranging for Interservice Vehicle Support. Arrangements for interservice support generally
provide that DOD components furnishing the service may not assume any liability whatsoever for per-
sonal injury or property damage caused by any vehicle while it is in the custody of the using component.
The using DOD components must:
   10.2.1. Assume the cost of picking up and delivering vehicles.
   10.2.2. Properly operate, maintain, and use vehicles in their custody.
   10.2.3. Take administrative action relating to damage or theft of the motor vehicle in their custody.
   10.2.4. Assume responsibility for any damages resulting from accidents or incidents while the vehicle
   is in their possession.

10.3. Activity Pooling. A transportation and equipment pool:
   10.3.1. Operates where it will be most economical or provides the most satisfactory transportation
   service.
   10.3.2. Pools full or partial transportation assets of separate activities. The pool segments are located
   within an area most convenient to the majority of the vehicle users.
   10.3.3. Is administered by a lead activity designated by the components. It may be subdivided locally
   as necessary. Agreements for activity pooling are sent through channels to HQ USAF/ILTV for coor-
   dination.

      TRANSPORTATION REQUIREMENTS RESULTING FROM TERRORIST THREATS

11.1. Vehicle Support Resulting From Terrorist Threats. Because of terrorist activities, the Air Force
has a program to provide heavy and light armored vehicles, domicile-to-duty transportation, and vehicle
painting and marking exceptions for threatened key personnel and senior officers. HQ USAF Criminal
Investigation & Counterintelligence (SAF/IGV) consolidates and validates all requests for these special
vehicles or marking waivers in response to terrorist threats.

11.2. Submission Procedures:
     11.2.1. The requesting MAJCOM or FOA submits all requests for special vehicle requirements to
     SAF/IGV.
     11.2.2. SAF/IGV validates special vehicle requirements based on terrorist threats. Once validated,
     SAF/IGV provides a recommendation to HQ USAF/ILT and ILS.

11.3. Armored Vehicle Requirements:
     11.3.1. New Vehicle Procurement. HQ USAF/ILSR ensures the recommendation is consistent with
     public law, executive orders, and DoD directives, and approves the recommendation. Procurement,
     both quantity and unit cost, must be authorized by Congress. If approved, HQ USAF/ILSR allocates
     necessary BP8200 funds.
     11.3.2. Light Armored Vehicles. MAJCOMs, FOAs, or DRUs may request SAF/IGV approval for
     procuring and installing approved protection on existing vehicles. Submit requests when any of these
     conditions exist:
        11.3.2.1. The level of protection required makes the installation of armor on an existing vehicle
        more advantageous or economical.
        11.3.2.2. Agreements provide separate funding for vehicles and armor.
        11.3.2.3. Application of armor on an existing vehicle is the only method for obtaining armored
        vehicles.
NOTE: Domicile-to-duty requirements. See Chapter 2.

11.4. Painting and Marking Exemptions:
     11.4.1. Unlimited Exemptions. Motor vehicles regularly used for intelligence, investigative, or secu-
     rity purposes are exempt from identification and marking provisions. These include vehicles:
        11.4.1.1. Used by the Air Force Office of Special Investigation (AF/OSI).
        11.4.1.2. Required to be exempted under a Status of Forces Agreement.
     11.4.2. Exemptions Based on Terrorist Threats. Unified commanders of overseas commands (dele-
     gatable to theater component commanders) and the CSAF for CONUS requirements can grant exemp-
     tions. Exemptions are for motor vehicles assigned to key military leaders in positions vulnerable to
     terrorist attacks when conspicuous identification will endanger their security or that of the U.S. Gov-
     ernment.
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                91


  11.4.3. Additional Exemptions:
     11.4.3.1. MAJCOMs may request exemptions if conspicuous identification will hamper mission
     accomplishment or endanger the security of persons or that of the US Government. Justification
     must explain how identification as a government vehicle will preclude mission performance or
     endanger individuals or the U.S. Government. Submit marking exemption requests for covert
     operation and mission requirements through command transportation channels to HQ USAF/ILT.
     Requests must contain the following information:
         11.4.3.1.1. The specific use of the vehicle.
         11.4.3.1.2. Any reasons why an available exempted vehicle cannot be used.
         11.4.3.1.3. The length of time for the exemption.
     11.4.3.2. For overseas commands, MAJCOM/LGTs may authorize marking exemptions for vehi-
     cles located within their area of responsibility when conspicuous identification could endanger the
     security of individuals or U.S. Government interests. Theater component commanders may be
     delegated this authority. Do not delegate further.
     11.4.3.3. To ensure standardization, all exemption requests will ensure:
         11.4.3.3.1. The servicing AF Office of Special Investigations (OSI) headquarters validates the
         request.
         11.4.3.3.2. Coordination by the Air Force component anti-terrorism council or focal point for
         anti-terrorism.
         11.4.3.3.3. The Air Force component maintains records and documentation of exemption
         requests.

                                       CONTRACTOR SUPPORT

12.1. Policy. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Sub-part 45.304, contractors
shall ordinarily furnish any motor vehicles needed in performing Government contracts. When Govern-
ment Furnished Equipment (GFE) is provided, the contractor will bear all operations and maintenance
costs associated with vehicles approved as GFE. This includes vehicle operations and maintenance
(O&M) expenses, preventive maintenance, inspections, diagnostics, and repair parts and labor.
     12.1.1. Activities shall obtain MAJCOM/LGT (or equivalent) approval prior to including any
     government-owned vehicles as GFE in a Statement of Work (SOW) and contract solicitation.
     12.1.2. In accordance with FAR Sub-part 45.310, agency-peculiar vehicles may be furnished to
     a contractor when a prospective contractor cannot, through commercial buy or lease sources,
     obtain these assets with similar capabilities that meet mission requirements or for other reasons
     the contracting officer determines to be in the Government’s best interest and coordinated by
     the MAJCOM/LGT. Replacements for Air Force peculiar or unique vehicles provided as GFE
     in the contract will be programmed through the Air Force vehicle buy process.
     12.1.3. Approved GFE vehicle authorizations will typically be authorized using one of two Allow-
     ance Standards (AS):
        12.1.3.1. AS 037: Appropriated Funded Vehicles for Contractors: Use when Air Force vehicles
        are provided as “agency-peculiar” Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to a contractor and
        the Air Force is responsible for providing replacements. Normally provided when a contractor
        cannot, through commercial buy or lease sources, obtain these assets with similar capabilities that
        meet mission requirements.
        12.1.3.2. AS 051: Contractor Support: Use when Air Force vehicles are provided as Government
        Furnished Equipment (GFE) to a contractor and will not be replaced by the Government (USAF).
        Fleet Management will not rotate vehicles to/from a contractor authorized/assigned under AID
        051.
        Authorizations under this allowance will be reduced /deleted upon turn in of the asset to DRMO.

12.2. AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program, Chapter 9, provides contracting guidance pertaining
to furnishing existing government property to contract/ISSA providers. Units should apply the decision
matrix in Table 9-1 to determine the potential advantage of providing GFE.
     12.2.1. If, after applying the matrix, the host unit determines government furnished vehicles are
     potentially advantageous to the Government, the host financial analysis office will perform a cost ben-
     efit analysis (CBA) to substantiate the cost advantage of providing vehicles
        12.2.1.1. The CBA will include a Certificate of Satisfactory Economic Analysis stating the anal-
        ysis follows AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis, and AFMAN 65-506, Economic Analysis guidance.
        The Certificate of Satisfactory Economic Analysis will include signed coordination with Base
        Finance, Base Contracting, and Base Transportation.

                               ALTERNATIVE FUELED VEHICLES

14.1. Background. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) (Public Law 102-486) and Executive
Order (EO) 13031 (13 Dec 96), “Federal Alternative Fueled Vehicle Leadership,” directs federal agen-
cies to acquire specific minimum levels of alternatively fueled vehicles (AFVs). These mandates were
established to improve the Nation’s air quality and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Our national
strategy is to create a Federal fleet which drives the country to commercialize AFVs and the infrastructure
to support them. DoDI 4715.4, Pollution Prevention, 18 Jun 96, further requires that the Secretaries of the
Military Departments establish programs to purchase and operate AFVs in accordance with EPACT. The
Air Force established the Alternative Fueled Vehicle System Program Office (AFVSPO) at Warner-Rob-
ins Air Logistics Center with primary responsibility to promote, plan, coordinate, and assist MAJCOMs/
installations as necessary to field AFVs and develop the infrastructure to support them throughout the Air
Force.

14.2. Acquisition. EPACT specifically applies to general purpose light-duty vehicles (LDVs, under
8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight) based in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) (cities, counties, or
consolidated areas with a 1980 population of 250,000 or more). AFV requirements for each MSA instal-
lation in a given fiscal year are calculated by multiplying the number of LDVs procured (new acquisitions
and long-term leases) times the EPACT percentage required for that fiscal year. Beginning in FY99 and
each year thereafter, 75 percent of all MSA-based LDVs acquired each year must be AFVs. (For a list of
MSAs, see http://www.afdc.doe.gov/legislation/msacnty.pdf)
   14.2.1. Exemptions. Section 303(b)(3) of EPACT exempts most law enforcement vehicles, emer-
   gency vehicles, and vehicles used for military purposes that must be exempt for national security rea-
   sons. AFVSPO will serve as the clearing house for exemption requests, exemption data collection,
   and exemption reporting. The following instructions are based on Deputy Under Secretary of Defense
   (Environmental Security) memo, Guidance for Claiming Exemptions From the Alternative Fueled
   Vehicle (AFV) Requirements of the Energy Policy Act (EPACT), 23 Oct 97:
       14.2.1.1. A law enforcement vehicle may be:
           14.2.1.1.1. Any vehicle which is (1) specifically approved in an agency’s appropriation act for
           use in apprehension, pursuit, patrol, or protection, or is routinely used for other law enforce-
           ment activities such as surveillance, or (2) covered by the current version of Item 17 or Item
           17A, Federal Standard Number 122, published by GSA.
           14.2.1.1.2. A leased vehicle equipped with at least the following components: (1) for passen-
           ger automobiles, heavy-duty electrical, cooling, and suspension systems and at least the next
           more powerful engine than is standard for the automobile concerned; or (2) for light trucks,
           emergency warning lights or identification or markings such as “police.”
           14.2.1.1.3. An unmarked vehicle which is certified by the Secretary of the Air Force as essen-
           tial for the safe and efficient performance of intelligence, counterintelligence, protective, or
           other law enforcement duties.
       14.2.1.2. An emergency vehicle is any vehicle that is legally authorized by a government author-
       ity to exceed the speed limit to transport people and/or equipment to and from a situation in which
       speed is required to save lives or property, such as a rescue vehicle, fire truck, or ambulance.

         14.2.1.3. National Security Vehicles:
             14.2.1.3.1. Vehicles defined as “tactical vehicles” are automatically exempt from EPACT
             AFV requirements, and a national security exemption need not be claimed for them.
             Light-duty vehicles similar to those driven by the general public are also automatically exempt
             as tactical vehicles if the vehicles have been modified (such as the addition of a 24-volt elec-
             trical system) to meet military specifications, unless the vehicle is normally used as an admin-
             istrative vehicle.
             14.2.1.3.2. Administrative vehicles that may have to be deployed as part of a military opera-
             tion will not automatically receive a national security exemption. Many vehicles can operate
             on alternative fuel when performing their administrative missions at home station and operate
             on a petroleum-based fuel when deployed as part of a military operation. A national security
             exemption should be claimed for such a vehicle only when there is substantial possibility that
             the vehicle will be deployed, and the vehicle could not be deployed if it were an AFV, or when
             the AFV attributes of the vehicle would affect performance of its mission when deployed.
         14.2.1.4. MAJCOMs/units are encouraged to acquire alternatively fueled law enforcement and
         emergency vehicles if such vehicles are capable of meeting mission requirements. Such AFVs
         should be counted as credits toward the total AFVs required under EPACT.
      14.2.2. AFV requirements may be satisfied through original equipment manufacturer (OEM) vehicle
      purchases, long-term vehicle leases, or conversions of existing vehicles. EO 13031 grants extra LDV
      credits for alternatively fueled medium-duty vehicles (MDVs), heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs), and
      zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) regardless of source. Each MDV or ZEV counts as two LDVs; each
      HDV counts as three LDVs. ZEV credits may be combined with MDV/HDV credits.
      14.2.3. Air Force AFVs, whether purchased, leased, or converted, are either bi-fuel, flex-fuel, hybrid
      electric vehicles (HEVs), or dedicated AFVs.
         14.2.3.1. Bi-fuel AFVs have two mutually exclusive fuel systems and are designed to operate on
         either gasoline or an alternative fuel such as compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied petroleum
         gas (LPG), also known as propane, using one fuel at a time.
         14.2.3.2. Flex-fuel AFVs are capable of using gasoline, an alternative fuel such as E85 (85 per-
         cent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline), or a mixture of gasoline and alternative fuel through the
         same tank/system.
         14.2.3.3. HEVs have two sources of propulsion. There are many hybrid system concepts using
         fuel cells, gas turbines, diesels, and lean burn gasoline engines in combination with battery power.
         14.2.3.4. Dedicated AFVs are vehicles which operate on alternative fuel only.
             14.2.3.4.1. Electric vehicles (EVs) operate solely from power stored in a system of batteries.
             14.2.3.4.2. In the case of CNG vehicles, MAJCOMs / installations, after taking into account
             contingency support requirements, are encouraged to request dedicated vehicles for purchase
             or lease. Benefits of dedicated CNG vehicles generally include decreased purchase / lease
             costs, increased fuel load, higher efficiency, and reduced maintenance, as compared to bi-fuel
             vehicles.
      14.2.4. MAJCOMs / installations are responsible for requesting and prioritizing through the Priority
      Buy (PRIBUY) Program the appropriate number of new OEM AFV purchases to meet annual
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                               101


   EPACT/EO 13031 requirements. MAJCOMs and installations must continue to monitor vehicle allo-
   cations to ensure any shortages in OEM AFV acquisitions are compensated through additional AFV
   long-term leases or conversions.
   14.2.5. MAJCOMs / installations are also responsible for ensuring that long-term lease requests (para
   5.9.) meet EPACT/EO 13031 requirements for each requesting base. In most cases, AFV leases will
   require funding from installation operations and maintenance (O&M) sources. (For information on
   General Services Administration (GSA) AFV leases visit http://pub.fss.gsa.gov/motor/lease.html.)
   14.2.6. If the combination of purchases and long-term leases fails to satisfy overall AFV require-
   ments due to limited availability of OEM AFVs, installation transportation functions must pursue
   vehicle conversions. Coordination with the MAJCOM and AFVSPO are essential to ensure compli-
   ance with federal laws.
       14.2.6.1. Candidates for conversion will meet the following requirements. MAJCOMs may
       establish more stringent requirements as long as EPACT mandates are being met:
           14.2.6.1.1. Vehicle will be no more than four years old.
           14.2.6.1.2. Vehicle will have less than 40,000 miles.
           14.2.6.1.3. Vehicle will be fuel-injected/gasoline.
           14.2.6.1.4. Vehicle will be from one of the following management codes:
              14.2.6.1.4.1. LDVs: B101, B102, B103, B104, B106, B150, B168, B185, B188, B197,
              B198, B199, B200, B204, B205, B207, B211, B227, or C156.
              14.2.6.1.4.2. MDVs: B180, B190, B191, B192, B217, B222, C157, C158, or B176.
              14.2.6.1.4.3. Vehicles in other management codes, including B999, will be considered on
              a case-by-case basis.
       14.2.6.2. Diesel MDVs or HDVs may be converted to a dedicated CNG / propane engine. Seek
       expert help from AFVSPO before pursuing this option.
       14.2.6.3. All vehicle conversion applications must be installed and tested in accordance with the
       Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Addendum to Mobile Source Enforcement Memoran-
       dum 1A, 4 Sept 97. Because of the complexity of the certification process, all conversion efforts
       must be approved by the MAJCOM LGTV and AFVSPO. MAJCOMs or installations initiating
       such efforts must fund for the conversion certification. Conversion contracts must also include
       maintenance technician training on servicing of the conversion units. Failure to comply with the
       Addendum to Memorandum 1 A could result in EPA charges of tampering under Section 203(a) of
       the Clean Air Act.
   14.2.7. Once procured, AFVs count as credits toward EPACT/EO 13031 requirements regardless of
   whether they are assigned to an MSA. Nevertheless, MAJCOMs are encouraged to assign AFVs
   where infrastructure is available or the AFVs can be used to leverage potential infrastructure.

14.3. Infrastructure. Funding for development of on-base alternative fuel infrastructure is limited. The
EPACT mandates that agencies in MSAs arrange for fueling of AFVs at commercial, publicly accessible
facilities to the maximum extent practical.
102                                                      AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


      14.3.1. If a commercial station proves impractical in terms of fuel costs, vehicle wear, and manpower,
      a very advantageous means of acquiring fueling capability is through a contractor-owned / maintained
      equipment agreement.
      14.3.2. Base civil engineers are responsible for developing and programming local infrastructure in
      coordination with the installation transportation function, the Defense Energy Support Center
      (DESC), the installation fuels branch, other federal or state agencies with AFVs in the area, local util-
      ities, local commercial AFV fleet operators, etc.. For the AFV Program to continue to meet the man-
      dated requirements, MAJCOMs / installations must include infrastructure improvements in the
      Program Objective Memorandum (POM) process. Some local operations and maintenance funds may
      also be required. On-base AFV fueling pumps must be capable of accepting vehicle identification
      link (VIL) keys.
      14.3.3. Negotiating agreements with commercial fuel providers for alternative fuel stations can be
      complicated. Installations are encouraged to obtain access to commercial alternative fuel infrastruc-
      ture through their own efforts if possible, but are advised to seek expert help from MAJCOM or
      AFVSPO if the negotiations become complicated. Pitfalls that may be avoided through seeking
      expert help include disadvantageous agreements that require DoD to pay exorbitant fuel prices for
      long periods or agreements that provide for exorbitant penalties in the event that DoD installations fail
      to reach specified alternative fuel usage levels.
      14.3.4. HQ USAF/CE/LGS 4 Mar 96 policy memo, Acquiring Compressed Natural Gas Vehicle
      Fueling Capability, remains in force.

14.4. Alternative Fuel Usage. In accordance with EPACT; EO 13031; and the Deputy Under Secretary
of Defense (Environmental Security) memo, Guidance Regarding Use of Alternative Fuels, 12 Nov 97,
Air Force-owned or leased bi-fuel and flex fuel AFVs should be refueled with alternative fuel to the max-
imum extent practicable.
      14.4.1. If an Air Force-owned/leased AFV is usually driven on or near an installation that has an
      appropriate on-base alternative fuel station or has one or more formal agreements to use nearby public
      or private alternative fuel stations, the AFV should always be refueled at the alternative fuel station,
      except as stated in para 14.4.3. below. Air Force AFVs used under those conditions should achieve
      nearly 100 percent use of alternative fuel.
      14.4.2. If an installation has a nearby public or private alternative fuel station but no formal agree-
      ment has been established for its use, the installation should attempt to establish an economically
      advantageous use agreement, as described in para 14.3.3. In the interim, if an AFV is usually driven
      on or near the installation, it should be refueled at the nearby alternative fuel station to the greatest
      extent practical.
      14.4.3. All OEM and converted bi-fuel AFVs will be operated on 4-6 gallons of gasoline once every
      6-8 weeks. The vehicle should be operated in gasoline mode until the fuel tank is almost empty. The
      tank should then be replenished with 4-6 gallons of fresh gasoline. This periodic introduction of fresh
      fuel into the tank helps avoid malfunction due to “stale” or aged fuel when the vehicle is switched to
      gasoline mode. Any automatic switch-over from the primary alternative fuel supply to gasoline and/
      or subsequent gasoline mode operation that occurs during normal vehicle usage is equivalent to the
      above procedures, as long as at least four gallons of gasoline is consumed and replaced within two
      months.
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                    103


   14.4.4. If an AFV is frequently driven off base for substantial distances, it should be refueled at alter-
   native fuel stations to the greatest extent practical. Such vehicles should always be equipped with a
   regional map or directory of appropriate alternative fuel stations. Maps or directories may be obtained
   from the following:

document compliance with EPACT and EO 13031. WR-ALC/LE will submit each completed report
through HQ USAF ILSR to DUSD(ES)EQ/PP and OMB. MAJCOM inputs for this report should cover
the fiscal year and are due at WR-ALC/LE NLT 15 Nov each year. Submissions must include the follow-
ing information:
      14.5.1. Reporting Air Force owned AFVs:
         14.5.1.1. WR-ALC/LE will compile Air Force owned AFV data from automated reporting sys-
         tems to the maximum extent possible. Manual data inputs from the MAJCOMs may also be
         required to some extent.
         14.5.1.2. MAJCOMs are responsible for ensuring that bases report AFVs by the appropriate fuel
         type in the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) as well as the Air Force Equipment Management
         System (AFEMS). Upon request from WR-ALC/LE, MAJCOMs will manually report AFVs in
         order to reconcile inventory with the automated systems. Once the automated systems are fully
         updated, manual reporting or Air Force owned vehicles will only be necessary to reconcile indi-
         vidual discrepancies. The manual report of inventory must include at least the following of each
         AFV:
             14.5.1.2.1. Registration number
             14.5.1.2.2. Management code
             14.5.1.2.3. Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)

             14.5.1.2.6. Owning command
      14.5.2. Reporting leased AFVs: MAJCOMs are responsible for reporting long-term commercial
      (non GSA) leases of AFVs to AFVSPO. GSA will provide GSA AFV lease data to WR-ALC/LE for
      inclusion in the annual OMB report. The commercial lease submission must include at least the fol-
      lowing data for each AFV ordered during the current fiscal year and any projected commercial
      long-term AFV leases for two subsequent fiscal years:
         14.5.2.1. Management code
         14.5.2.2. Fuel type
         14.5.2.3. Base location
         14.5.2.4. Owning command
         14.5.2.5. Year of lease order (actual or projected)
      14.5.3. Reporting Vehicle Conversions: MAJCOMs must report to AFVSPO all conversions of con-
      ventional fuel vehicles outside of those centrally managed by AFVSPO. Locally initiated vehicle
      conversions must be reported for the fiscal year of the contract award or the year the order was placed
      against an existing contract. Conversion awards/orders projected for the two subsequent fiscal years
      must also be reported. The following data for all such conversions must be reported:
         14.5.3.1. Registration number
         14.5.3.2. Management code

     14.5.3.7. Base location
     14.5.3.8. Owning command
  14.5.4. Reporting Fuel Consumption: MAJCOMs are responsible for ensuring that bases report fuel
  consumption in OLVIMS. Since OLVIMS cannot accommodate all AFV fuel usage, MAJCOMs are
  responsible for manually reporting AFV fuel consumption data to AFVSPO. This will continue until
  automated fuel tracking is implemented. Installation transportation functions must obtain alternative
  fuel usage data from their base Supply Fuels office, including at least the following:
     14.5.4.1. Base location
     14.5.4.2. Owning command
     14.5.4.3. Fuel type

                                                  Chapter 15

                                      COMMAND AND CONTROL

15.1. General Information on Command and Control Vehicle (CACV) Authorization. Air Force
commanders with overall responsibility for operations or installation security, and who have a 24 hour
emergency response and continuous communications requirement, are authorized command and control
vehicles. Authorizations for these vehicles are strictly limited to key command positions, especially in
light of statutory restrictions on the use of government vehicles for “domicile-to-duty” transportation (31
U.S.C. 1344).

15.2. Qualification for Command and Control. The authority for command and control vehicles is
premised on a commander’s mission requirement for around-the-clock mobility and a vehicle based com-
munications capability. The commander must be assigned dedicated installation quarters.

15.3. Command and Control Vehicle Authorizations. Commanders occupying the following positions
are authorized command and control vehicles: MAJCOM Commanders, Numbered Air Force Command-
ers, and Center, Sector, Wing and Missile Group Commanders with overall responsibility for operations
(host or tenant) or installation security. Commanders of detached flying units, who qualify for a com-
mand and control vehicle, may request authorization for CACV authority through MAJCOM/LGT chan-
nels to HQ USAF/ILT. Other qualified commanders may apply for command and control vehicle
authority through MAJCOM/LGT channels to HQ USAF/ILT. Overall responsibility cannot be dele-
gated. For this reason, there will be only one command and control vehicle authorization per base unless
otherwise approved.

15.4. Command and Control Vehicle Use. Incidental use of command and control vehicles, to include
travel to physical conditioning facilities, eating places, the post office, cleaners, banks, etc., is authorized.
This authority accommodates the commander’s around-the-clock responsibility to assure an immediate
response and communications capability with the acknowledged need to accomplish certain tasks related
to personal health and sustenance. This incidental use should be exercised reasonably and at no signifi-
cant cost to the government. All other “official use” constraints, as described in Chapter 3, including the
provisions on spouse and family member travel, apply to command and control vehicles. In case of leave
or extended absence from the duty station, the commander passes CACV authority to the individual
assuming the responsibility.

15.5. Forms Prescribed:
      15.5.1. AF Form 171, Request for Driver’s Training and Addition to U.S. Government Driver’s
      License.

members of other Federal agencies when specifically indicated) attending primary or secondary schools,
including kindergarten (or “primary” or “junior primary,” etc.) where this group or class:
Is conducted during the regular school year to provide educational experiences for the year immediately
preceding the first grade.
Is under the control of the local public board authority having administrative control and direction of free
public education in a county, township, independent, or other school district within a state.
DoD Dependent Student (Overseas Only)—A minor student who:
Is the child, stepchild, adopted child, ward, or spouse of a dependent sponsor, or who is a resident in the
household of a DoD sponsor who stands in loco parentis (resides with) to such an individual and who
receives one-half or more of his or her support from such a sponsor; and
Is authorized transportation at US Government expense to or from an overseas area, if the DoD sponsor is
military; or
Is an authorized member of the household of a DoD sponsor entitled to a living quarters allowance, as
authorized by the Department of State Standardized Regulations and DoD 1400.25 if the sponsor is a

Permissible Operating Distance (POD)— DoD maintains and operates in peacetime only those owned
or leased motor vehicle assets needed to meet approved DoD emergency and wartime requirements that
cannot be met from commercial transportation resources. Requirements in excess of DoD capability shall
be met by the use of commercial carriers. The POD is that distance from the installation that GMVs travel
before competing with commercial carriers (Ref. DoD Directive 4500.9).
As a guide, a 75-mile radius is sufficient to support operations at most bases. Identify frequently traveled
points that exceed the standard radius.
Vehicles used to support the United States Air Force Courier transfer stations, Armed Forces Courier Ser-
vice, Air Force Bands, the Air Force Academy, and the Air Force Office of Special Investigation are
exempt from POD limitations.

7 DECEMBER 1999


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This Interim Change (IC) 99-2 provides clarified guidance for watercraft management. Provides policy
for management of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE)
as it relates to vehicle support for contractors. Additionally, it provides amplifying guidance regarding
official use of government motor vehicles. A bar (|) indicates revision from the previous edition.


1.2.4.7. Procures, manages, inventories, and controls Air Force owned and/or operated watercraft in
excess of 32 feet in length. Air Force watercraft are boats and vessels used to support an Air Force mis-
sion. Those purchased with nonappropriated funds, such as Morale, Welfare and Recreation boats are not
in this group.


1.2.4.7.1. Air Force units with watercraft must operate them safely in accordance with Air Force policy
directives, instructions, and MAJCOM supplements that embrace good marine practices and Coast Guard
recommendations. Equip and maintain vessels with fire fighting and life saving equipment prescribed in
Title 46, Code of Federal Regulations. Operate and maintain vessels in compliance with environmental
standards. Units will institute strong vessel safety programs that include accident prevention and proce-
dures for reporting all safety related incidents and mishaps.


1.2.4.7.2. Approve watercraft requirements. Maintain record keeping for cost analysis, reassign vessels
within the command, and arrange disposition of vessels after coordination with other MAJCOMs.


1.2.4.7.3. Ensure tracking and reporting of all watercraft related costs are accomplished. Develop proce-
dures for and use of the AF Form 615, Unit Watercraft Operations and Cost Summary Report.


1.2.8.2.10.2. Ensure procedures are established, in concert with the Vehicle Maintenance Manager, for
reporting and accounting of indirect non-productive labor hours. At a minimum, this includes reporting
these hours for the VOO/VOS; Operations Supervisor; Fleet Manager; Fleet Management personnel;
OR&L personnel; Chief Dispatcher and dispatchers. Reference AFMAN 24-307 and AFSCM 24-1.


2.6.5. Official use for active duty personnel include transportation to or from Air Force scheduled
appointments, i.e., MPF records check, dental appointments, hospital outpatient appointments, etc. Use
transportation priorities specified in paragraph 2.4.
118                                                    AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


2.6.16. Chapel Support. Provide transportation to the installation chaplain and chapel personnel perform-
ing official duties in the same manner as other mission support activities. Support includes direct admin-
istrative support and staff assistance visits to off-base locations. The installation staff chaplain submits
the transportation request for chapel program activities such as picnics, special groups, social activities,
renewal activities, chapel youth trips, or summer camps. Submit all requests to transportation well in
advance of the date required. Support is predicated on the availability of vehicles and vehicle operators
and must not pose a detriment to higher priority missions.


2.6.16.2. In all cases, the chapel must program and identify chapel transportation requirements to
base-level transportation for inclusion in the installations annual budget submission.


2.6.18. Air Force Museum Support. Transportation service (U-Drive, Radio Taxi, Non-Radio Taxi and
Mass Transportation) in support of appropriated funded AF Museums may be provided when such trans-
portation can be made available without detriment to the DoD mission. Figure 2.1. lists AF Museums
that receive appropriated funds.


2.7.3. As a rule, transportation to on-base dining facilities is an individual responsibility. However, the
installation commander may authorize personnel to take DoD-owned, rented, or leased vehicles to
on-base dining facilities.


3.1.1. Supports AF Form 1252/1252A, USAF Vehicle Serv-O-Plate and Vehicle Identification Link
(VIL). The Base Fuels Management Office (BFMO) is responsible for serv-o-plate management and the
automated fuel service station (AFSS) equipped for VIL. Vehicle Operations will provide the BFMO a
semi-annual, or as required, master list depicting all assigned vehicles and organizations codes. A system
will be developed between the BFMO and Fleet Management to ensure notification of vehicle deletions,
assignments, and rotations.


3.1.2. Records On-Base Fuel Consumption. Air Force vehicles operated solely on government installa-
tions are exempt from Federal taxes charged on the fuel consumed. In order to get appropriate tax credit
for the fuel consumed by these vehicles, they must be identified and tracked. Fleet Management provides
a list of vehicles that operate only on the installation to the BFMO. This list is updated quarterly, and must
include the vehicle registration number, unit, and all grades of product that will be used (e.g. MUR, MRR,
DL1, DL2, CNG, LNG etc.). BFMO will use this list to encode the VIL with a Type Issue/Defuel (TID)
code. Tax refunds are filed quarterly by SA-ALC/SFRF for ground products consumed at all AF bases. If
any vehicle uses a county, state, or federal highway one or more times during the quarter, that vehicle can-
not be tax exempt and will not be included on the list provided to the BFMO. Crossing over a county,
state, or federal highway at an intersection does not count as use.
4.4.2. FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL. The AF Form 2293 issued to military personnel (including mem-
bers of the Reserve and National Guard that are subject to the UCMJ) is valid indefinitely, unless sus-
pended or revoked. When military personnel separate from the service, they may keep their AF Form
2293 if the words “NOT VALID-SEPARATED FROM THE SERVICE” are overstamped or legibly
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                   119


marked on the front and back of the form. See paragraphs 4.7. and 4.8. for civilian and contractor licens-
ing requirements.


4.4.4.1. Only the USAF Vehicle Operator Apprentice Course may utilize “span of control” for training
students in vehicle operations. Technical Training students in formal training may operate vehicles in a
controlled environment (range, obstacle concourse--not open for public use) without an instructor inside
the vehicle. Instructor must be present in the immediate area and maintain communication with student
operator at all times. “Span of control” cannot be utilized for base-level on-the-job (OJT), a qualified
trainer is required to be in the vehicle.


4.5.4. Training Lesson Plans. Unit commanders will ensure vehicle training lesson plans are developed
and on file for vehicles assigned to their organization. The unit explosives or weapons safety manager is
required to coordinate on lesson plans for vehicles that handle or transport explosives.


5.9.1.1. An economic analysis verifies a cost benefit to the government. Reference AFI 65-501, Eco-
nomic Analysis, for economic analysis requirements and procedures.


5.9.4.1. Fleet Management validates all requests for rentals and leases for installation activities. Coordi-
nate with Contracting to ensure vehicles are not rented/leased without prior validation regardless of who
funds for the rental/lease. Lease or rental may be executed with AF Form 9 or, where guidance allows,
IMPAC government credit card. A copy of validated AF Form 9 or related IMPAC documents will be
retained in Fleet Management.


6.3.1. Ensure personnel assigned REMS manager duties have completed Registered Equipment Manage-
ment Course, J6ANU2T151-000.


6.5. Allowance Standard (AS) 019. AS 019 identifies core Air Force vehicle allowances. Core allow-
ances are those allowances common to all Air Force commands. AS 020 through 034 identifies vehicle
allowances unique to specific MAJCOMs or equivalents. If a BOI does not exist, a request to establish a
BOI must be sent to the MAJCOM. If approved by the MAJCOM, the request will be sent to WR ALC
for final approval and inclusion in the applicable AS.


6.6. Allowance Standards (AS) ASs are identified in AFMAN 23-110V2. The ASCs most commonly
used in vehicle fleet management are:


6.6.4. 019 - 034 - Allowance Standards: Prescribes maximum allowances for vehicles to accomplish
functional and organizational missions. Allowance Standards 019 - 034 are source documents only and
do not constitute authorization or approval authority for vehicles.

6.6.6. 051 - Contractor Support. Use when Air Force vehicles are Government Furnished Equipment
(GFE) to a contractor and will not be replaced by the Government (USAF). Fleet Management will not
rotate vehicles to/from a contractor authorized/assigned under AID 051. Authorizations under this allow-
ance will be reduced/deleted upon final disposition of the vehicle.
6.6.10. 037 - Appropriated Funded Vehicles for Contractors. Use when Air Force vehicles are provided
as “agency-peculiar” Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to a contractor and the Air Force is
responsible for replacing the vehicle.


6.14.1. Vehicles may be considered for withdrawal from DRMO only when an open authorization exists,
or when the vehicle in DRMO is in better condition than the vehicle assigned. MAJCOM/LGT must
approve vehicles withdrawn from DRMO to be placed in the Air Force inventory. Vehicle Maintenance
Manager (VMM) must certify a vehicle as economically repairable and warrants withdrawal action.
Refer to AFI 24-302, Vehicle Maintenance Management for additional considerations.


6.14.2. Non-REMS vehicles can be withdrawn for use in Air Force training courses as training aids with
approval from MAJCOM/LGTV. Submit request through the base supply materiel management flight.


6.28.6.1. Owning organizations have made financial arrangements to procure all maintenance through
purchase agreements or the IMPAC card. Maintenance will be performed according to manufacture spec-
ifications. Base Transportation manpower and facilities will not typically be used to maintain golf cars
and LSVs, refer to AFI 24-302, Vehicle Maintenance Management.


9.8. Services Support. Bus transportation in support of DoD-authorized services programs or family ser-
vice center (FSC) programs may be provided when such transportation can be made available without
detriment to the DoD mission. This support is limited to bus transportation only unless specifically noted
otherwise. The installation commander is the approval authority for this type of transportation support.
When available, NAF and/or commercial transportation sources will be used. All requests must be coor-
dinated with the installation Transportation and Services. Such services cannot be provided for domi-
cile-to-duty transport. Additionally, it is subject to the following restrictions:


9.8.1.1.6. Scouting programs (Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America) operating at U.S. military instal-
lations located overseas.


9.8.1.2. Reimbursable. Transportation may be provided to MWR/NAF category C revenue generating
organizations. Such service shall be accomplished on a reimbursable basis. A fare, using the formula in
Figure 9.1. is charged for all operations and maintenance costs. Do not use vehicle acquisition costs
when determining the fare.


9.8.3. Specific guidance for supporting Private Organizations can be found in AFI 34-233, Private Orga-
nizations (PO) Program. Private organizations generally do not get either NAF or APF support.
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                  121



12.1. Policy. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Sub-part 45.304, contractors
shall ordinarily furnish any motor vehicles needed in performing Government contracts. When Govern-
ment Furnished Equipment (GFE) is provided, the contractor will bear all operations and maintenance
costs associated with vehicles approved as GFE. This includes vehicle operations and maintenance
(O&M) expenses, fuel and lubricants, preventive maintenance, inspections, diagnostics, and repair parts
and labor.


12.1.1. Activities shall obtain MAJCOM/LGT (or equivalent) approval prior to including any gov-
ernment-owned vehicles as GFE in a Statement of Work (SOW) and contract solicitation.
12.1.2. In accordance with FAR Sub-part 45.310, agency-peculiar vehicles may be furnished to a
contractor when a prospective contractor cannot, through commercial buy or lease sources, obtain
these assets with similar capabilities that meet mission requirements or for other reasons the con-
tracting officer determines to be in the Government’s best interest and coordinated by the MAJ-
COM/LGT. Replacements for Air Force peculiar or unique vehicles provided as GFE in the
contract will be programmed through the Air Force vehicle buy process.


12.1.3. Approved GFE vehicle authorizations will typically be authorized using one of two Allowance
Standards (AS):


12.1.3.1. AS 037: Appropriated Funded Vehicles for Contractors: Use when Air Force vehicles are pro-
vided as “agency-peculiar” Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to a contractor and the Air Force is
responsible for providing replacements. Normally provided when a contractor cannot, through commer-
cial buy or lease sources, obtain these assets with similar capabilities that meet mission requirements.


12.1.3.2. AS 051: Contractor Support: Use when Air Force vehicles are provided as Government Fur-
nished Equipment (GFE) to a contractor and will not be replaced by the Government (USAF). Fleet Man-
agement will not rotate vehicles to/from a contractor authorized/assigned under AID 051.
Authorizations under this allowance will be reduced /deleted upon turn in of the asset to DRMO.


12.2. AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program, Chapter 9, provides contracting guidance pertaining
to furnishing existing government property to contract/ISSA providers. Units should apply the decision
matrix in Table 9-1 to determine the potential advantage of providing GFE.


12.2.1. If, after applying the matrix, the host unit determines government furnished vehicles are poten-
tially advantageous to the Government, the host financial analysis office will perform a cost benefit anal-
ysis (CBA) to substantiate the cost advantage of providing vehicles
122                                                    AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004


12.2.1.1. The CBA will include a Certificate of Satisfactory Economic Analysis stating the analysis fol-
lows AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis, and AFMAN 65-506, Economic Analysis guidance. The Certifi-
cate of Satisfactory Economic Analysis will include signed coordination with Base Finance, Base
Contracting, and Base Transportation.

1 NOVEMBER 2001


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS


This Interim Change (IC) 01-1 provides policy for pickup and delivery operations. A bar (|) indicates revi-
sion from the previous edition.


1.2.8.2.10.3. Vehicle Operations is responsible for all pickup and delivery services (except Due-In for
Maintenance (DIFM) turn-ins) within the confines of the installation 24 hours per day and 7 days per
week. Provide pickup and delivery of supplies and equipment, except base service store items, to base
units by using a time definite delivery concept of operations. Recommend periodic meetings between
Vehicle Operations, Traffic Management (TM), Supply, and major customers to ensure delivery sched-
ules/sweeps meet mission priorities and customer needs.


1.2.8.2.10.3.1. Intra supply movement of cargo will remain a Supply responsibility; however, movement
of cargo from supply storage/issue locations to the Aircraft Part Stores (APS) and Flight Service Centers
(FSC) will be supported by Vehicle Operations.


1.2.8.2.10.3.2. The movement of DIFM turn-in items will be supported and managed by the Supply Flight
Service Center (FSC). DIFM issues will be handled in the same manner as other MILSTRIP cargo and
will be supported by Vehicle Operations.


1.2.8.2.10.3.3. Movement of cargo internal to a unit i.e., maintenance squadrons, civil engineer, commu-
nication squadron, operations squadrons, etc, will remain a unit responsibility. This does not preclude
Vehicle Operations from providing normal cargo movement support when the unit does not have the capa-
bility to move such item(s).


1.2.8.2.10.3.4. Supply retains primary responsibility for facilitating communication between Supply ele-
ments, customers, and Vehicle Operations. Time Definite Delivery concept of operations is the prime
method for all cargo delivery i.e. scheduled sweeps. Supply will inform Vehicle Operations of priority
deliveries (01, 02, and MICAP), identification of turn in requirements, notification of special equipment
needs for bulk cargo, etc.


1.2.8.2.10.3.5. Residual workload e.g., sorting and staging of cargo, facilitation of customer requirements,
etc, will remain Supply responsibilities. Supply will presort to accommodate established sweep/route
schedules.
AFI24-301_HILLAFBSUP1_I 5 AUGUST 2004                                                                   125



1.2.8.2.10.3.6. Use the Supply Asset Tracking System (SATS) in concert with pickup and delivery
requirements. Deployment of SATS is not a prerequisite to establishing Vehicle Operations P&D services.
Base Supply will be responsible for all SATS hardware (i.e. warranty, maintenance, and replacement).


1.2.8.2.10.3.7. Assist Supply Document Control Element in resolving document errors generated in the
P&D function. Supply is the overall OPR for all delivery document issues.


1.2.8.2.10.3.8. Deliver shipments/materiel to DRMO generated from base supply turn-ins or transfers
(TRM). This also includes directed and lateral shipments (non-directed) originating from the flight ser-
vice center and aircraft parts store to TM outbound freight.


1.2.8.2.10.3.9. Customers who normally get support from the flightline parts store are responsible for
pickup of these items. Vehicle Operations will deliver items to customers not normally supported by a
flightline parts store.


1.2.8.2.11. Provide Prime Knight aircrew support IAW AFI 34-246.


1.2.9.6. Ensure sufficient resources are available to support Time Definite Delivery and Priority Delivery
of supplies, equipment, and cargo to installation units.


1.2.9.6.1. Time definite delivery concept of operations is the standard for delivery of supplies, equipment,
and cargo. Time definite delivery utilizes scheduled sweeps over designated routes/areas of the installa-
tion. Frequency of scheduled sweeps and number of delivery routes/areas is a local determination driven
by mission, volume of cargo and customer needs.


1.2.9.6.1.1. Delivery of priority cargo to include 01, 02, and MICAP, will be delivered within 30 minutes.
Scheduled sweeps may be used if delivery will be provided within 30 minutes. Supply is responsible for
notifying vehicle operations when priority 01, 02, and MICAP items/parts cannot wait for scheduled
sweeps.


1.2.9.6.1.2. Vehicle Operations, in concert with Supply and all customers, will tailor sweep frequencies/
routes to provide support for primary mission of the installation/base. Delivery frequencies/routes should
minimize the need for individual unit delivery requirements.


1.2.9.6.1.3. Priority items/parts resulting from due-out release (DORs) will be delivered via scheduled
sweeps, unless vehicle dispatch is contacted for an unscheduled delivery.

1.2.9.6.1.4. Establish operating instructions for items that require special handling instructions/proce-
dures, e.g., classified, health hazard, pilferable, electrostatic discharge.


1.2.10.7. Retrieves disabled government vehicles. Local policy and/or instruction should be developed to
address retrieval of disabled vehicles on the installation under the guise of official business/use. Dispatch
Operations may be called to move disabled POVs, NAF, or AAFES vehicles causing traffic safety or fire
fighting obstacles on base. Only security forces or fire department authorities may make these requests.
Wrecker operators are not liable for any damages incurred to any POV, NAF, or AAFES vehicle being
towed/removed under these conditions.


1.2.10.13. Provide priority and time definite delivery of supplies, equipment, and cargo to installation
units. Pickup and delivery transportation services will be supported out of Dispatch Operations and man-
aged/controlled in the same manner as all other requests for dispatch/service. Do not establish alternative
locations (sub-motor pools) to support pickup and delivery services.


1.2.10.13.1. Develop local procedures in conjunction with Supply to ensure current copies of delivery
destinations, unit supply POCs, and the Classified Receipt Listing are available. When SATS is in use, the
smart card contains most of this information, however, in the event SATS is unavailable, hard copy docu-
ments containing this information will be required.


1.2.10.13.2. Notify Supply immediately of all unnecessary delays caused by the absence of receiving per-
sonnel, incorrect addresses, organizational refusal, improper documentation, etc. Items precluded from
delivery due to these circumstances will be returned to Supply for resolution and included on the next
scheduled sweep or may be picked up from Supply by the customer.


1.2.10.13.3. Ensure duty dispatcher(s) and all vehicle operator(s) are briefed on established procedures to
properly dispatch and transport-classified materiel and cargo.


1.2.10.14. Ensure proper (standard) dispatch category code is used for each transportation service request
in the Dispatch modules of OLVIMS.


1.2.10.15. Control and account for assigned SATS equipment. Issue SATS equipment to operators prior to
dispatch, if required.


1.2.11.6. Ensure qualified vehicle operators are available to support all transportation requests for dis-
patch service(s).

1.2.11.7. Ensure vehicle operators adhere to established procedures for delivery of classified materiel to
respective organizations. Allow only unit individuals identified on the Classified Receipt Listing to sign
for classified property.


1.2.11.8. Operator will ensure supplies, equipment, and cargo are properly secured and protected while in
transit.


1.2.11.9. Establish procedures to ensure vehicle operator(s) safeguard assigned SATS equipment.


1.2.11.10. Ensure items that must be signed for have an authorized individual’s signature on the pickup or
delivery document.


1.2.13.1.4.1. At a minimum, collect the following data monthly.


1.2.13.1.4.1.1. Dispatch Supervision Monthly Workload Record (automated).


1.2.13.1.4.1.2. Summary of work by Dispatch Automated Fleet Information System (DAFIS) category
