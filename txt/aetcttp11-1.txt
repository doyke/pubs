                                           Chapter 1
                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1 Overview. War in the aerospace environment is currently in a period of fast-paced evolution.
Since the beginning of aerial combat, technological development has driven, and been driven by,
progress in building more efficient and effective aircraft and weapons. Nevertheless, the very
basic principles of aerial combat remain virtually unchanged. As technology advances, mutual
support and situational awareness (SA) are still critical to effective employment of airborne
weapons. Current data link systems and situation displays will not replace core competence in
basic skills. These fundamentals, or standards, are only part of training for combat, and provide
the building blocks for effective tactical employment. Discussions on formation flying, air-to-air
(A/A) and air-to-surface (A/S) in the T-38C are designed to aid in building a strong foundation
of tactical skills. The maneuvers addressed are a means to an end, a starting point for pilots to
study and explore first hand describing the methods used to achieve desired results in air combat.
1.2 Purpose. This manual contains fundamental procedures and techniques to accomplish T-38C
Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) missions. It is designed to supplement training
programs; and when used in conjunction with applicable Air Force instructions, flight manuals,
and syllabi, provides a solid foundation on which IFF training can be accomplished. This volume
is not directive in nature and provides no authority to depart from established training
procedures, regulations, or directives.
1.3 Change Procedures. Aircraft modification and operational/training experience will, and
should, dictate changes to this text. Old procedures and tactics should never be disregarded
simply because they have been around for a while. However, new and better ways of
accomplishing the mission will evolve and will need to be incorporated into this document.
Safety-of-flight changes will be incorporated as soon as possible. Other inputs will be included
during normal review cycles. Suggested changes should be forwarded from any level of
command using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Send AF Form 847
to 19 AF/DOG.

                                        PREPARATION

2.1 Introduction. Mission preparation, individually and as a flight, is the foundation of
successful fighter operations. It encompasses cockpit resource management (CRM),
psychological considerations, objective application, the prioritization based on SA, and flight
leadership. Each factor is part of a professional attitude, which enhances safety and increases
tactical potential. The CRM core concepts of SA—flight integrity, communication, risk
management and decisionmaking, task management, mission planning and debrief—are
addressed throughout this chapter. The success of all that follows (briefing, execution, and
debriefing) is directly related to the amount and quality of preparation. First, individually prepare
yourself for the mission. Second, determine mission objectives in terms of measurable combat
capability and related basic pilot skills. Finally, decide how to brief and execute the mission.
2.2 Psychological and Physiological Considerations. A fighter mission demands total
involvement, whether it is actual combat or continuation training. This means being mentally and
physically prepared for the mission. Mental preparation requires setting aside outside stresses,
allowing for total concentration on the mission. Physical preparation means conditioning the
body for the extraordinary demands of aerial combat and adopting a healthy lifestyle. This is an
attitude! A fighter pilot's attitude is a proper blend of pride, desire, aggressiveness, and
knowledge.
     2.2.1 Psychological Considerations. In combat, you will not have the option of calling;
     “KING’S X, I HAVE LOST MY LEADER,” or “BINGO, KNOCK IT OFF.” You cannot
     plan on the enemy making a mistake. No one knows for sure how they will react in the next
     combat situation. This fact in itself causes anxiety. Anxiety is also caused by fear or
     misunderstanding one's own abilities or an opponent's abilities in the aerial arena under
     adverse conditions. The foundation for overcoming anxiety is established by developing
     confidence in the following:
          Your aircraft.
          Your wingman.
          Your ability to accomplish the mission.
           2.2.1.1 Situational Awareness (SA). SA is the continuous perception of self and
           aircraft in relation to the dynamic environment of flight, threats, and mission and the
           ability to forecast, then execute, tasks based on that perception. It is gained through
           assimilating information obtained through:
                  Visual cueing and perceptions.
                  Flight members.
                  Communication.
                  On-board avionics.
           One of most important factors in maintaining SA is a common understanding of the
           briefed plan. That understanding, overlaid with current fight conditions to arrive at an
           overall picture of what is happening and what will happen defines SA.
           2.2.1.2 Habit Patterns. It is a documented fact that when fighter pilots find
           themselves in stressful situations, their performance tends to follow previously
8                                                        AETCTTP11-1          4 SEPTEMBER 2009

          learned habit patterns. Habit patterns cannot be turned on and off at will. The same
          skills developed in training will be the ones used during actual combat. Combat does
          not act as a catalyst and bring hidden qualities magically to the surface or suddenly
          quench poor habits developed in the past. Do not expect instant success to come to
          you. Being a good fighter pilot is, to a large extent, just plain old hard work.
          Professionalism is one quality that must be common to all fighter pilots. Excessive
          pride can result in not admitting your faults; excessive desire can cause you to
          overlook small details along the way; overly aggressive attitudes can cause you to
          override good judgment. Professionalism is the only quality that can achieve the
          proper blend of pride, desire, and aggressiveness.
    2.2.2 Physiological Considerations. For a fighter pilot to be mentally and physically
    prepared to meet demanding mission tasks, a good diet, proper physical conditioning, and
    adequate rest are a must. Proper mission planning begins with good physical and mental
    preparedness.
    2.2.3 G-Awareness. US Air Force fighter aircraft capability can meet or exceed pilot
    tolerance for sustained high Gs. This capability often allows pilots to apply more Gs than
    their body can tolerate; after a "short grace period," oxygen available to the brain is depleted
    and consciousness is lost. Pilots must anticipate G-onset, control G-onset rate, and
    coordinate an effective anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM)—this takes mental discipline
    and practice to master. G-induced loss of consciousness (GLOC) is extremely dangerous for
    two reasons. GLOC episodes have historically resulted in loss of both the aircrew and
    aircraft, and unlike other pilot stresses, it is not possible for pilots to accurately and reliably
    know how close they are to the GLOC threshold. The best solution to the GLOC problem is
    pilot awareness. The pilot has ultimate control over G-stress factors.
          2.2.3.1 Flight Factors. Sustained high G for long periods can bring the pilot's body to
          near exhaustion more quickly than at lower G levels. High onset rates can bypass the
          normal stages of reduced vision resulting in nearly instant unconsciousness.
          2.2.3.2 Conditioning. Be prepared mentally and physically for high-G stress. Proper
          physical conditioning involving anaerobic training (free weights, nautilus, universal
          gym, hydra fitness, etc.) and aerobic training (running, racquetball, cycling, etc.) play
          an important role in improved G-tolerance and endurance.
          2.2.3.3 Currency, Anxiety, and Aggressiveness. G-tolerance is increased through
          practice. Layoffs such as a long leave, duty not including flying, or even just coming
          out of a low-G flying phase require a buildup of G-tolerance. Anxiety in new
          situations or other pressures can mask your objectivity in assessing tolerance.
          Aggressiveness, if not properly controlled, can lead to overconfidence and inattention
          to, or disregard for, bodily warning signs of fatigue and stress. Pilots need to be aware
          of these factors and be on guard for signs of G-stress limits. An individual's G-
          tolerance and warning signs can vary from day to day. Fatigue, tunnel vision, or
          grayout are critical warning signs that the pilot is already at the limit. Do not push this
          limit; there is no buffer or reliable safety margin. Expect G-tolerance to vary at
          different times even on the same flight, based on all the factors discussed. When
          pilots suspect their effectiveness is being reduced, they must take appropriate action.
AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            9

           In combat, it may mean separation if able. In training, it may mean knock-it-off
           (KIO).
           2.2.3.4 Anti-G Straining Maneuver (AGSM). The AGSM is the best defense
           measure available to pilots. It is very important to perform the same, correct AGSM
           each time you anticipate and/or apply G. The proper technique needs to become a
           skill that is integrated with other flying skills.
           2.2.3.4.1 Preparation. The straining maneuver should begin prior to G onset. It can
           be difficult to “catch up” to the Gs if you get behind from the start. Begin by leading
           with lower body tensing and then the breathing component.
           2.2.3.4.2 Tensing Muscles. Ensure a squeezing or contracting of the muscles. Avoid
           a tendency to push with the legs. Tense and maintain all the lower body muscle
           groups to include the following:
               Legs–thighs, hamstrings, quadriceps, and calves.
               Gluteus maximus.
               Abdominal muscles.
           2.2.3.4.3 Breathing Component. This consists of a forced exhalation against a
           closed airway. The following items are highlights of the breathing component:
                 Sufficient initial breath.
                 Block the airway, not just the lips.
                 Short, quick air exchange every 3 seconds.
                 Prevent air leaks such as groaning or breathing through the nose.
                 Vary upper body intensity depending on the G-load.
                 Maintain the technique until the Gs are unloaded.
           For more information, refer to AFPAM 11-419, G-Awareness for Aircrew.
2.3 Effective Communication (Comm). This includes knowledge of common errors, cultural
influences, and barriers (rank, age, experience, and position). Skills will encompass listening,
feedback, precision, and efficiency of comm with all members and agencies (that is, pilots,
wingmen, weather, air traffic control, and Intelligence). Comm ties the mission together. From
the beginning of mission planning through the lessons learned in the debrief, comm is the basic
determinant of both mission accomplishment and success. The flight lead must effectively
translate the plan and objectives to each wingman so assets can be directed to achieve the goals.
The flight leads must communicate thoroughly during planning to produce the correct flight
products for their mission. In the briefing, they must address the flight’s execution plan and
major contingencies that can be expected during flight and the planned reactions. Standards must
be established to cover those contingencies that are not briefed. Briefings must be complete and
understood so that contingencies can be executed in the air using concise radio communications.
Visual signals must be understood and used correctly to be effective. Preparation to ensure
effective in-flight communication includes the following:
   Know and adhere to accepted and standard terminology (squadron standards, AFTTP 3-1.1,
    General Planning and Employment Considerations, and ATC) (located at
    https://wwwmil.nellis.af.mil/units/561jts/dn/volumes.aspx).
   Brief anticipated comm flow.

   Have zero tolerance for complacent, sloppy, or ambiguous radio calls (in flight and during
    debrief).
   Establish an appropriate assertion level; ensure two-way communication.
   Assume nothing.
   State concerns and intentions and get an acknowledgment/decision.
2.4 Task Management. Task management involves establishing priorities for maximum
efficiency and avoiding task saturation.
     2.4.1 Establish Priorities. There are occasions during nearly every mission when you
     cannot do everything in the time available. This requires assigning priorities (task
     prioritization). At the top of the list are Critical Tasks – things you have to do. Lower on
     the list are things you would like to do – Noncritical Tasks. The list of have-to-do tasks
     should be established long before getting near an aircraft.
           2.4.1.1 Critical Tasks. These are tasks that cannot be ignored without catastrophic
           consequences. If noncritical tasks begin to cause inattention to critical tasks,
           immediately disregard the non-critical tasks until all critical tasks are accomplished.
           Critical tasks include:
                 Maintaining aircraft control.
                 Deconflicting flightpath.
                 Avoiding terrain.
                 Being aware of fuel.
           2.4.1.2 Prioritizing Noncritical Tasks. Lower priority tasks fall into two general
           categories: formation tasks and mission tasks. Formation tasks range from ops checks
           to proper execution of tactical turns. Critical tasks, such as element deconfliction, can
           never be disregarded, but other tasks will require monitoring and management. For
           example, Fencing in during military operations area (MOA) entry, formation tasks
           (deconfliction, staying in formation, and radio awareness) should be prioritized above
           mission tasks (heads-up displays (HUD), weapons checks, and avionics). Although
           mission success is usually measured by how well mission tasks are accomplished,
           keep overall mission success in perspective. Remember, if the aircraft does not get
           back home, the mission has failed. If formation tasks become secondary to mission
           tasks, as a general rule, mission success will suffer. Letting nice-to-do things take
           priority over have-to-do things will jeopardize yourself and those around you.
           2.4.1.3 Misprioritization. Mispriortization can have disastrous results. Remember
           the basics of Aviate, Navigate, and Communicate. Be alert for situations that
           regularly require prioritization of critical and noncritical tasks: Switch changes during
           formation; Fencing out during a rejoin; digging out an approach plate while in
           instrument meteorological conditions (IMC); etc.
     2.4.2 Task Saturation. Task saturation is a temporary failure to properly assess available
     information and initiate required pilot actions.
           2.4.2.1 Hazards. Some of the possible hazards of task saturation include the
           following:
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                          11


               Loss of mission effectiveness due to inability to perform mission tasks.
               Interference with the tasks of others.
               Fuel waste.
               Training rule violations.
               Loss of control of the aircraft.
               Ground collision.
               Midair collision.
        2.4.2.2 Causes. The main cause of task saturation is the sheer number of duties which
        must be handled by the pilot or crew. Among the tasks to be performed are aircraft
        control, navigation, formation, tactics, and weapons employment. Pilots can become
        saturated by trying to do too many of these tasks at once. Loss of visual references,
        which occurs most often while flying in weather or at night, increases the possibility
        of task saturation. Other contributing factors include complex training or combat
        scenarios as well as habits formed while flying other types of aircraft (such as switch
        and display locations). Managing cockpit tasks requires good judgment and strong
        interpretive and discriminatory skills.
        2.4.2.3 Task Saturation. Symptoms of task saturation include:
               Missing radio calls.
               Difficulty controlling the aircraft.
               Getting behind the aircraft.
               Loss of SA.
               Spatial disorientation.
               Channelized attention.
   2.4.3 Task Management Techniques. The following techniques will assist in preventing or
   overcoming task saturation:
        2.4.3.1 Preflight:
             Ensure aircrews are well rested, properly nourished, and mentally prepared.
             Know what is expected on the mission. Ask questions if any aspects of the
              mission are unclear.
             Ensure checklist items and habit patterns are followed. If events interrupt habit
              patterns (ground abort, night, etc.), slow down to ensure everything is
              accomplished.
        2.4.3.2 In Flight:
             Anticipate and be prepared for the next briefed event. Always try to stay ahead
              of the aircraft.
             Do not dwell on mistakes.
             Control false sensations and quickly transition to instruments when visual cues
              become unreliable.
             Be prepared for changes in task priorities.
             Reduce head-down time by maintaining a good cross-check among
              instruments, sensors, and visual references.
             Watch for symptoms of task saturation and act to minimize them:
12                                                        AETCTTP11-1          4 SEPTEMBER 2009

                 -   If low altitude, climb to cope.
                 -   Reprioritize current tasks, placing aircraft control first.
                 -   Inform crew mate or flight member about situation.
                 -   Pass control of aircraft.
                 -   Call a KIO if tactically maneuvering.
     2.4.4 Mission Accomplishment. This task has a high priority; however, in peacetime there
     is no mission more important than safe recovery of the flight. The aircrew cannot afford to
     exceed personal limits in the desire for mission accomplishment. Aircrew limits vary from
     day to day, based on capabilities and experience, as well as psychological and physical
     preparation.
2.5 Mutual Support. Mutual support is a contract within a flight of two or more aircraft that
supports the flight’s mission accomplishment. It is directly related to SA in that it requires
positional awareness and performance evaluation of all flight members and any threats, as well
as an understanding of both the flight’s and threat’s capabilities.
     2.5.1 Flight Leadership. Flight leads have the general responsibility for planning and
     organizing the mission, leading the flight, delegating tasks within the flight, and ensuring
     mission accomplishment. They are in charge of the resources entrusted to them; they must
     know the capabilities and limitations of each member of the flight. Once airborne, they have
     the final responsibility and controlling authority for establishing formations, maximizing the
     flight’s effectiveness, and leading the flight successfully during the mission.
     2.5.2 Wingman Responsibilities. Wingmen have the supporting role in the flight. They
     help the flight lead plan and organize the mission. They have visual lookout and sensor
     responsibilities and provide backup navigation for the flight as required. Wingmen execute
     as briefed or when directed by the flight lead and provide mutual support throughout all
     phases of the mission.
2.6 Flight Discipline. Discipline is perhaps the most important element for success in any aspect
of aerial combat. On an individual basis, it consists of self-control, maturity, and judgment.
Teamwork is an integral part of discipline; individuals evaluate their actions and how they affect
the flight and mission accomplishment. If all flight members know their respective duties, they
work together as a flight. Experience and realistic training leads to professional air discipline.
2.7 Mission Planning:
     2.7.1 Planning Considerations. The flight lead establishes priorities for mission planning
     and delegates them to flight members to ensure all planning considerations are addressed
     and to preclude any duplication of effort. All flight members should be involved in the
     mission preparation. The depth of planning detail is dictated by the syllabus, mission and
     flight experience level, but the bottom line is “All necessary mission planning is completed
     in time to conduct a concise, comprehensive briefing.”
           2.7.1.1 Flight Lead/Direct Support Instructor Pilot (IP) Responsibilities. Flight
           leads have the general responsibility for planning and organizing the mission, leading
           the flight, delegating tasks within the flight, and ensuring mission accomplishment.
           They are in charge of the resources entrusted to them; they must know syllabus
           requirements and the capabilities and limitations of each member of the flight. Once
           airborne, they have the final responsibility and controlling authority for establishing
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            13

          the formations, maximizing the flight’s effectiveness, and leading the flight
          successfully during the mission.
          2.7.1.2 Wingman Responsibilities. Wingmen have critical responsibilities of helping
          the leader plan and organize the mission. Wingmen should contact their flight lead the
          day prior for specific direction and arrive early enough to complete prebrief
          administration items. Check with the flight lead again the day of to see if he requires
          any special items, other than the standard for the brief. Check the schedule for last-
          minute changes; fill out your mission data card and sign out on the flight orders as
          required (students normally sign out only on solo flights). Check the weather, notices
          to airmen (NOTAM), safety and/or time-critical notices such as flight crew
          information file, and pilot read file. Review the standard departure and recovery for
          the mission and study a map of the working area; ensure familiarization with
          boundaries, altitudes, and restrictions.
        2.7.2 Mission Objectives. Preparation for any given mission should be based on
        mission objectives. Mission objectives will normally be driven by the syllabus on IFF
        missions. The mission objectives should give the “big picture” of what is happening for
        each mission and are used to measure individual and team mission success. Well-
        defined objectives should be based on the mission requirements and tasking,
        environment, threat, and other factors such as wingman experience. Clear objectives
        limit the impact of distractions and focus attention on mission accomplishment. A valid
        objective has three parts: performance, conditions, and standards.
          2.7.2.1 Performance. Describes what each pilot or the flight does during the mission.
          It is action and is not vague. Use action verbs such as employ, practice, negate.
          2.7.2.2 Conditions. Describes starting parameters such as "from an offensive perch"
          or "given two Bandits with noise jamming and a BVR setup."
          2.7.2.3 Standards. States how well the performance must be done and is categorized
          by time limits, accuracy, and quality (such as, “meeting valid kill criteria,” or
          “ranging within +500 feet”).
    2.7.3 Operational Risk Management (ORM). Part of mission planning is assessing and
    managing the risks inherent in fighter operations with respect to individual limitations and
    vulnerabilities. Review the mission and clearly define what is to be accomplished. Then
    focus on critical phases throughout the flight; keep in mind many mishaps occur during
    takeoff, en route, rejoins, and landing, not just during tactical operations in the MOA.
    Attempt to assess all possible risks during these flight phases by building a mental picture
    of the sequence of events—look for the obvious risk factors, then ask yourself: if something
    goes wrong, how do I adapt? In addition, critically assess each of these areas:
        Pilot—proficiency/currency issues; physical and mental health, skill level, and
         experience.
        Environment—weather, time-of-day (TOD), terrain, altitude, Gs, and temperature.
        Aircraft—configuration limitations, cockpit setup, and potential distractions.
        Supervision—personality conflicts, discipline, supervisory, and peer pressures.
2.8 Briefing. The purpose of the briefing is to clearly convey the “what” and “how to” of the
mission.
14                                                       AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009

     2.8.1 Preparation—The Key to a Quality Briefing. If the briefing time is limited, and/or a
     large amount of information needs to be covered (instructional or highly complex missions),
     management of the allotted briefing time will be improved by practicing the briefing. This
     will allow the briefer to formulate verbiage and rework areas that may not have been well
     thought out.
           2.8.1.1 Briefing Guides. Briefing guides are one of the most useful tools for
           preparing and delivering flight briefings. They help the briefer organize thoughts and
           identify areas where knowledge may be lacking. Using another aviator’s briefing
           guide, or a generic, can be useful as a reference; however, developing an individual
           briefing forces the briefer to think through the briefing material. The detail contained
           in the briefing guide will depend on the familiarity with the subject. The less familiar
           a briefer is with the topic, the more detailed the briefing guide should be. If a briefer
           is familiar with a topic, an outline may be sufficient.
           2.8.1.2 Briefing Room Boards and Computer Slide Usage. Preparing white boards
           and/or slides is essential to enhancing the overall quality of the briefing. Information
           on boards should be limited to essential information. As a general rule, the less
           cluttered the briefing boards, the less distracted the flight will be during the briefing.
           Avoid filling the boards with laundry lists for the mission or "memory joggers" for
           the briefing. If utilizing computer slides for a presentation, turn off the screen or use a
           black slide when proceeding to the next topic.
           2.8.1.3 Briefing Room Interactive (BRI) Usage. BRI is an outstanding tool for
           making expeditious briefs that can quickly incorporate high fidelity visual aids. BRI
           is also very useful for premission study and preparation. On instructional sorties,
           using BRI allows students to go back and review areas on their own. Consider using
           example videos to put a picture to instruction.
           2.8.1.4 Speaking Ability. A briefer may be very knowledgeable in a subject, but if
           the individual is unable to communicate ideas in a clear and logical way, the briefing
           will not be effective. Practice, including "dry runs," will help improve speaking skills
           as well as prevent some of the most common pitfalls during briefings: improper
           focus/time allotment, excessive rambling/going off on tangents, and not presenting in
           a logical order/disjointed flow. Practice also aids in eliminating distracting verbal
           pauses (for example, “with that,” “basically,” “big picture,” or “um”).
     2.8.2 Flight Lead/Direct Support Coordination Briefing. The "coord" briefing describes
     what is to be accomplished and sets the tone for the entire mission. Establish objectives that
     include a standard that measures successful performance. Admin, or "motherhood," items
     should be covered in an efficient manner. Locally developed standards can be used to brief
     common or repetitive elements of the mission. Most of the time should be spent on the
     "meat," or primary focus, of the mission. Alternate missions should be less complex than
     the original mission but also have specific objectives. The flight lead controls the brief and
     should be dynamic, credible, and enthusiastic. He should motivate and challenge the flight
     to perform to planned expectations, asking questions to involve flight members and
     determine briefing effectiveness. The IFF coordination briefing should not normally last
     longer than 15 minutes to allow adequate time for the instructional briefing.
AETCTTP11-1      4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             15

         2.8.2.1 Techniques for a Good Briefing:
             Ensure the boards are clean prior to setting up any presentation.
             Ensure all writing and drawings are neat and legible from where the flight is
              sitting.
             Always stand when presenting the briefing.
             Start the briefing on time and with a precise and correct time hack.
             After any necessary introductions, lead the briefing with the overall mission
              objective(s) and "big picture" overview.
             Maintain eye contact with the flight while briefing.
         2.8.2.2 Wingman Briefing Role. Wingmen should be prepared to brief all topics
         required by the flight lead, syllabus, and/or squadron standards. Topics normally
         include the weather, NOTAMs, emergency procedure (EP), and threat of the day. Be
         organized and efficient while briefing. Stay focused and pay attention during the
         brief. Write down any questions you may have and ask them at the appropriate time.
         Never leave a briefing with doubts or unanswered questions.
   2.8.3 Instructional Briefing. The instructional briefing describes how to accomplish
   specific mission tasks. Like the coord briefing, the focus should be on the primary mission
   objectives—the "meat" of the mission. The instructor must take into account the experience
   level of the wingmen and adjust the brief accordingly. Be sure to end your brief with
   adequate time for everyone to mentally review the mission and accomplish any other
   prestep requirements—normally not less than 10 minutes.
         2.8.3.1 Briefing Flow. The briefing should start with the mission objectives and
         narrow to the specific mechanics, incorporating how to recognize the pictures and
         describing techniques to execute the correct maneuvers – Picture, Plan, and
         Execution. Philosophical discussions and blanket statements should be avoided.
         2.8.3.2 Visual Aid Usage. Correct integration of visual aids in a briefing will enhance
         a briefing and better communicate the message to the flight. Conversely, the
         inappropriate or inaccurate use of visual aids can confuse the flight and distract from
         the overall quality of the brief. Some common visual aids include drawings and
         canopy/HUD cutouts, briefing sticks, air combat maneuvering instrumentation
         (ACMI), and BRI.
         2.8.3.2.1 Drawings and Canopy Bow/HUD Cutouts. Drawings and canopy
         bow/HUD cutouts must be accurate enough to support the desired point. Common
         errors include talking at the board while drawing and blocking the drawing from the
         student’s view. A good way to avoid these errors is to limit one’s action to one at a
         time. When using the board for drawings or canopy bow references, look at the board
         and make an accurate drawing or depiction—without talking. When finished, move to
         a side allowing the student to see the picture, and look at the flight while briefing to
         the visual aid. Drawings may also be put up prior to the instructional brief. If using
         the same room as the coord brief, be sure coordinate with the flight lead to avoid
         stealing his boards or cluttering his presentation.
         2.8.3.2.2 Briefing Sticks. Briefing sticks must be used in a manner accurate enough
         to convey aircraft relationships and movement. When using sticks for offensive basic
16                                                      AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009

           fighter maneuvering (OBFM) and defensive BFM (DBFM), hold them underhanded
           and anchor the student’s aircraft with either the nose or tail aimed at the student’s ear
           so the perspective makes sense from the student’s view. Look at the sticks while
           positioning them, then look at the student while briefing. The student’s jet should
           remain stationary, and only the adversary’s jet should move to present the
           instructional picture. Upon completing the briefing point, put the sticks down. Do not
           use the briefing sticks as a pointer.
           2.8.3.2.3 ACMI and BRI. IP demo ACMI files can be used to show the student
           expected lines and fight progression as well as cockpit views. BRI can be used to
           view animations and IP demo HUD footage. Prior setup is recommended and system
           knowledge is essential to coherently integrating these instructional tools
2.9 Debrief. It is a well-accepted axiom that the majority of the learning takes place in the
debrief. Because of this, it is important each flight member devotes as much intensity to this part
of the mission as to the briefing and in-flight execution. The objective of the debrief is to
determine if the desired mission objectives were achieved, identify lessons learned, and define
aspects of training needing improvement. An honest assessment of performance is more
important than “winning the debrief.” Do not allow pride to stand in the way of admitting
mistakes. Receive instruction openly using the debrief as a tool for improvement. Furthermore,
the debrief should also cover those areas that were executed well, and the overall performance
should be compared with the mission objectives. The end result should be all participants gaining
solid direction on how to do it better next time. All debriefs include the following main areas:
preparation, reconstruction, analysis, instruction, and summary.
     2.9.1 Preparation. Flight leads should have a specific mission debriefing guide aligned
     with the mission briefing guide – this will ensure a logical structure and flow. All
     participants should know (from the briefing) what will be required from them during the
     debrief, and sufficient time between arriving in the debrief area and starting the debrief
     should be allowed to gather that information (normally 20 to 30 minutes). Use everything
     available (notes, tapes, ACMI, etc.) to best gather the needed data. Have tapes cued for
     review. Preflight the debriefing room—clean boards; sufficient pens, sticks, props; operable
     playback equipment; etc.
     2.9.2 Reconstruction. Flight leads set the rules of engagement (ROE) for the debrief to
     ensure accurate mission reconstruction. Additionally, they should be aware of all
     participants’ time constraints – tight turn times, follow-on training events, other
     commitments, etc. The debrief is conducted in a professional atmosphere and critiques of
     execution should not be taken personally. Follow debrief etiquette – give only the
     information asked for when asked and save questions for the appropriate time. Avoid
     defensive attitudes and do not make excuses for poor performance. Take notes for later
     review.
     2.9.3 Analysis. Once execution has been reconstructed, the next step is to highlight the
     areas that require further analysis. In any given mission or engagement, there are dozens of
     execution areas that could be discussed in detail. The problem with doing so is that it is
     impossible for the average flight member to absorb more than three or four major points per
     engagement. For this reason, it is critical to determine which errors were key to the overall
     outcome of the engagement and focus on these during the instructional phase of the debrief.
AETCTTP11-1      4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            17

   2.9.4 Instruction. There are two basic components to providing an instructional fix to a
   particular error. First, IPs must determine if the error was due to perception, decision, or
   execution so the student can understand why the error was made. This is important to
   consider because there may be cases where the end result was acceptable, but it was more
   due to luck or a gross error on the part of the adversary than on correct execution on the
   student’s part. Second, the instructor must provide the student with quantifiable techniques
   or procedures to correct the flaw on future missions. If there are numerous methods for
   correcting the execution flaw, IPs must determine which one(s) will be most effective for
   each particular case. Too much information can create confusion; too little can leave the
   student with insufficient understanding. Like the mission briefing, if used correctly, visual
   aids can reinforce instruction and significantly enhance a student’s understanding.
   2.9.5 Summary. Use the mission objectives to provide a quantifiable measure of
   performance. In addition, look to each event to find learning points and determine trend
   items. At the conclusion of the debrief, summarize the key performance areas that are
   working well and those that need to be improved upon for the next mission.
   2.9.6 Debrief Techniques. Begin the debriefing with an overview of the debriefing flow.
   While exact formats will vary depending on mission types, a normal debrief flow for an IFF
   mission is: plan/brief, flight admin to and from the working area, area/fight admin, and
   primary mission execution. In most cases, debrief of the plan/brief and admin should be
   expeditious – the focus should be on the execution of the primary mission. To ensure this,
   review tape/notes and be prepared at the beginning of the debrief with desired points. If a
   major execution error will be caused by the plan/brief, emphasize that point when
   debriefing the execution. There are numerous techniques to run an effective debrief. Two of
   the most common are:
         2.9.6.1 Performance Measure Technique. When accomplishing multiple repetitive
         events, such as BFM sets or container pattern bombing, a good technique is to
         evaluate the performance at each event. See Table 2.1. When doing this, look to
         answer the following questions:
         2.9.6.1.1 What Happened? This involves reconstructing of the event and
         determining “what” occurred. This portion helps focus the use of ACMI, drawings,
         and tapes to find a cause for the error.
         2.9.6.1.2 Why Did It Happen? This involves determining the cause or causes of why
         things went wrong. In this phase, the answer to “why” the event occurred should be
         drawn back to perception/"picture," plan, or execution.
         2.9.6.1.3 How to Prevent This Error from Happening Again? This is the most
         important portion of the debrief. The “how” gives all of the flight members a concrete
         lesson to pull from the training that just took place. Without this step in the debrief
         process, the opportunity for flight members to grow as combat aviators is lost. When
         answering the “how,” the instructor is offering recommendations to the student as the
         best method to:
              Recognize the error.
              Prevent the error.
              Fix the error if it occurs again.

          2.9.6.2 Debrief Focus Points (DFP) Technique. DFPs are a way of selecting the
          major points in a sortie requiring analysis. This technique is especially effective
          during complex mission debriefs where it is not reasonable to analyze every
          individual event. Instead, DFPs focus the overall debrief to find the major lessons
          learned. See Table 2.2.
          2.9.6.2.1 Points to Ponder (PTP) Previously referred to as PTPs, DFPs are usually
          phrased in the form of a question and point the learning in the direction of where the
          mission failed to meet objectives. A mission may have numerous DFPs, it may have
          sub-DFPs to help answer the main DFP, or, if all objectives were met, there may be
          no DFP.
          2.9.6.2.2 Contributing Factors (CF). CFs are events or occurrences that potentially
          contributed to the DFP. They can be further classified into the particular type of error:
                Perception – fight analysis.
                Decision – manuever selection.
                Execution - manuever mechanics.
          2.9.6.2.3 Instructional Fixes (IF). Once all DFPs and their associated CFs have been
          identified, IPs are responsible for providing the "how-to" fix to help ensure better
          performance next time.
          2.9.6.2.4 Root Cause (RC). Following IFs, IPs should highlight the initial or primary
          CF that led to the DFP.
          2.9.6.2.5 Learning Points (LP). LPs are used when no DFP is warranted but where
          an error occurred that merits increased emphasis in the debrief. LPs may exist in
          cases where the objectives were met, but mistakes were made which on another
          mission may have led to failure. LPs are answered with IFs the same as with DFPs.
          2.9.6.2.6 Lesson Learned (LL). LLs are the overall/"big picture" takeaways for an
          engagement or sortie that highlight fundamental changes to be applied next time.

           2.9.6.2.7 Trends. Trends are similar events that occurred numerous times during a
           sortie or engagement. Whether good or bad, identifying trends can be helpful during
           summary.

to assess valid separation cues. If you are not sure you have valid separation cues, do not attempt
to separate.

                                            Chapter 3
                                          FORMATION

This chapter builds on the formation fundamentals learned in undergraduate flying training—
refer to AFMAN 11-251, Volume 1, T-38C Flying Fundamentals.
3.1 Introduction. We generally understand formation to mean two or more aircraft working
together with understood roles under one flight lead’s control. Control of the formation and flight
integrity are essential to coordinated effort, and can only be maintained if the lead has complete
knowledge and control of all the wingmen’s actions. It is the lead’s responsibility to brief and
direct the desired formation position and the wingman’s responsibility to be in that position until
the flight lead directs another, or the wingman gets permission to change his position.
3.2 Purpose. The two-ship is the basic employment standard for tactical aviation. Even when
part of a four-ship, you will have element leads and wingmen. The primary reason for two-ship
execution is mutual support. This concept follows the basic rules of war: mass of firepower and
coordinated maneuvering. Additionally, aerial warfare moves at a rapid pace and in multiple
dimensions. As a result, visually supporting one another in the air increases our likelihood of
survival and mission success. In many fourth- and fifth-generation fighters, this visual mutual
support is enhanced with “sensor” mutual support as well.
Solid formation flying by both flight leads and wingmen is the foundation upon which element
tactics are built. Flight leads are responsible for directing the formation to maximize lethality and
survivability. Wingmen are responsible for being in position and ensuring flightpath
deconfliction from their element lead as well as other members of the flight. As a wingman, your
priorities are remaining visual, being in the correct/correcting to the correct formation position,
and then working the radio and navigational aids (NAVAID). This can be remembered with the
acronym VFR. When multiple tasks are required, the key to success as a wingman is task
prioritization—knowing what to do first. At FENCE OUT, it is preferable to be padlocked and
momentarily on the wrong frequency than blind on the correct frequency.
3.3 Communications. All communications must be received and understood by every member
of the flight in order to be effective. As a guide to clear, concise, and correct communication,
utilize the brevity words found in AFTTP 3-1.1, Attachment 1. As a rule, you will use visual
signals in accordance with (IAW) AFI 11-205, Aircraft Cockpit and Formation Flight Signals, to
the max extent possible in order to preserve communication time available on our working
frequencies. While in IFF, you and your flight lead will likely be the only players using your
tactical frequency. Nonetheless, we will strive to use visual signals whenever possible to train for
future tactical environments where multiple players are using the same frequency
simultaneously.
     3.3.1 Radio Discipline. Efficiency on the radios requires discipline. By discipline we mean
     not only clarity and brevity when you transmit, but also limiting unnecessary transmissions.
     An old fighter pilot mantra says that a pilot, and especially a wingman, should never miss
     the opportunity to be quiet on the radio. However, there will be times when it is necessary
     to communicate information that is crucial to mission success. The fine line of silence
     versus transmission varies from mission to mission and is something that should be
     debriefed on every sortie.
AETCTTP11-1          4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                21

      3.3.2 Transmission Format. The first part of every call should always be the call sign. In
      the case of directive or interrogative communication, this should be the call sign of the
      aircraft you are transmitting to. This serves to get the attention of the person to whom you
      are directing the transmission. After the call sign, the communication should be directive,
      then descriptive. This format is important because it gets the flight moving in a very
      dynamic environment, and then tells why the action was necessary. EXAMPLE: “SMURF
      1, CLIMB, TRAFFIC 12 O’CLOCK, 1 MILE LEVEL.”
      3.3.3 Acknowledgement. When responding to radio transmissions, you should mimic flight
      lead whenever possible. EXAMPLE: "SMURF 1 OPS CHECK, 1 IS 2.7, 5.0 Gs." "2 IS 2.5,
      6.1Gs." Not all radio calls require a radio response, such as when you can signal
      acknowledgement with your actions. EXAMPLE: "SMURF 2 GO FIGHTING WING." As
      a general rule, if flight lead’s direction involves safety of flight (aircraft separation, terrain
      avoidance, fuel, etc.) or switches related to weapons, wingman should acknowledge on the
      radio.
3.4 Ground Operations. Working as an element starts on the ground. Ensure that during the
preflight and engine start you cross-check your flight lead. A frequent glance to your flight lead
will build your SA (ground aborts, etc.) and start good habit patterns that will transfer well once
airborne. Additionally, it will allow you to match your flight lead’s configuration in a timely
manner.
The initial check-in is a great opportunity to build your flight lead’s confidence in your
capabilities. Be aware of and ready for check-in time. As a general rule, if you’re not moving
switches with your left hand, have it on the throttle ready for a check-in at all times (unless
maintenance personnel are under the aircraft). Strive to be timely and crisp. If your mask is
hanging, raise it first. Be aware that there is a slight delay from the time you move the mike
switch to the time the radio actually transmits.
On taxi out, maintain the correct spacing from the flight lead. When taxiing as a four-ship,
number 3 and number 4 should mirror number 2’s spacing. All formation members should mimic
flight lead’s configuration and checks.
3.5 Basic Formation. Basic formation is IAW AFMAN 11-251, Volume 1. However, more is
expected from a fighter wingman than just the basics of ensuring deconfliction, maintaining
visual, and being in position. A smart wingman should also back up his flight lead by "staying
ahead of the jet." One example is being in close route formation anticipating fingertip when
approaching clouds or coming up initial, yet moving out and forward during longer during visual
meteorological conditions (VMC) transits in order to better clear for the formation. Being a
smart wingman involves, but is not limited to:
     Maintaining SA on the profile.
     Keeping up with the NAVAIDs.
     Clearing for the flight both visually and by LISTENING on the radios.
     Anticipating the next radio calls.
     Querying lead when unclear or when necessary to prevent safety or rule violations.
3.6 Two-Ship Tactical Formation. Two-ship tactical formations are the baseline formations for
employment. These formations include line abreast (LAB) and wedge. Although the parameters
vary from airframe to airframe, the tactical formations flown in IFF are very similar to what you
22                                                     AETCTTP11-1        4 SEPTEMBER 2009

will see in the combat air forces (CAF). Factors that affect how we fly our formations include the
threat, weather, visibility, background, and terrain. Unlike specialized undergraduate pilot
training, we use tactical formations not as an end to themselves, but as a means to facilitate
proper visual lookout, task prioritization and offensive and defensive tactics.
Wingmen should aggressively pursue being in position. This is an “aggressive” mental state, not
necessarily aggressive flight control actuation. The degree of aggressiveness depends on how far
out of position you are. Maneuvers to correct excessively poor formation may be aggressive but
never erratic. Continuously assess your position and make corrections. The earlier you perceive a
formation error the smaller the fix required and easier it will be to correct.
     3.6.1 Line Abreast (LAB). 4000 to 6,000 feet with 0° to 10° aft and up to 2,000 feet of
     altitude stack. Always strive for 0° aft. Your priorities in flying LAB formation are: LAB
     first (0° aft), range second, and lastly taking a stack. Maintaining a cross-check instead of
     constantly staring at the flight lead will allow you to see subtle changes in your position.
           3.6.1.1 Correcting LAB Position. The easiest way to correct formation position is to
           establish a cross-check that allows you to perform all assigned tasks and maintain
           your assigned formation position. In order to determine whether or not you are LAB
           with your flight lead, assess aspect angle; you should see 90°. Assuming you are
           coheading, this position is approximately when the other aircraft is over your
           shoulder to about an inch in front of your shoulder in the 4,000- to 6,000-foot range.
           Additionally, if you are stacked above or below lead and can see both wingtips, they
           should be lined up. Always strive to use geometry to fix your formation position
           versus just power.
           3.6.1.1.1 Behind the Line. If you find yourself behind the LAB line (less than 90°
           aspect), use the vertical and power to catch up to lead. You will need more airspeed
           than lead, so expect it to increase as you bunt and use mil power to catch up. It is OK
           to change from a stack above lead to stacking below unless you are in the low altitude
           structure. As the airspeed increases you should start to see aft line of sight rate.
           Remember, when you are LAB again you will still have overtake, so begin to
           decrease your airspeed to match lead slightly before you get to LAB. This can be
           accomplished by reducing power and/or trading airspeed for altitude. If not in special
           use airspace and flying an ATC assigned altitude you will primarily have to use
           power to get back into position.
           3.6.1.1.2 Ahead of the Line. If you are only slightly ahead of the line, you can climb
           to and fly a slightly longer total flightpath to “let” lead catch up with you. Forward
           line of sight rate should be generated during this process. Once again, anticipate
           getting back to the LAB position and work to match lead’s airspeed as you arrive at
           the proper LAB position. If you are far in front of lead, you must maneuver in the
           horizontal as well. Generally, it is best to make an aggressive, slightly climbing bid
           away from lead. Once you perceive line of sight forward, check back into lead (this
           will collapse range again). Finally, you will need to return to coheading and reassess
           whether you are LAB again.
           3.6.1.2 Correcting Lateral Position. Correcting lateral position is generally simpler
           than correcting LAB. Check into or away from lead as required to get to 4.000 to
           6,000. When checking into or away, apply aft stick to make a positive input. An
AETCTTP11-1    4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                              23

       unloaded check that adjusts your heading a couple of degrees may not do much for
       your lateral position. Every correction you put in has to be taken out again. The
       earlier you perceive a formation error the smaller the correction required and the
       easier it will be to fix. To assess range from lead, primarily use visual cues and then
       back them up with the air-to-air tactical air navigation (TACAN) (AAT). Use caution:
       the AAT lags and can cause range pilot-induced oscillations (PIO). This is especially
       true during and after tactical turns. Fly based on visual cues, then once you have
       stabilized, verify your range using the AAT.
       3.6.1.2.1 Visual Cues for Formation Ranges:
           >6,000 feet = “Cigar” with vertical tail, can’t see distinct burner cans.
           6,000 feet = Burner can barely visible protruding aft of vertical stab.
           5,000 feet = Can see burner, can distinguish from tail, “L” shape where boat
            tail meets aft end of vertical stabilizer. Canopy detail starts to become visible.
           4,000 feet = Canopy distinguishable from fuselage, can see but not read the tail
            letters.
           <4,000 feet = Detail on airplane, distinct canopy, can read tail letters. Beacon
            will be visible.
       3.6.1.2.2 Common Error. The most common error related to range in tactical
       formation flying is simply not assessing it in the first place. Once the task load builds
       in flight, students roll out of turns and don’t assess range. This allows current errors
       to go unchecked or even build. The best time to start correcting for both LAB and
       lateral spacing is DURING tactical turns (discussed in conjunction with tactical
       turns).
       3.6.1.3 Correcting Vertical Position. Corrections to the vertical position are
       normally referred to as “setting a stack.” At the proper range for LAB, the flight level
       will be approximately two beer cans above or below the horizon for a 1,500-foot
       stack. Since it is the last priority, ensure the LAB and lateral aspects of the formation
       are correct before working for a stack. Once that is accomplished, choose a stack
       direction that is most advantageous for you and your flight lead to remain visual.
       When looking into the sun, stack to pull lead away from it. If you are directly
       between your flight lead and the sun, stack to stay above or below the sun (usually a
       low stack). If neither direction makes maintaining the visual easier, stack high, to
       increase your potential energy for follow on maneuvering.
       3.6.1.3.1 Stacking High. To move from a level or low position, you must increase the
       power to achieve a high stack. In the T-38, this almost always requires MIL power.
       Your airspeed must increase very slightly to maintain your LAB position while
       climbing provided you were stabilized at LAB before you started the climb. When the
       proper stack is achieved, remember to pull the power back to the previous setting.
       3.6.1.3.2 Stacking Low. To move from a high or level position to a low stack, you
       need to reduce your power. The amount you reduce the power will be proportional to
       the angle of dive you use. Reduce the power enough to maintain your airspeed during
       the move to stack low. Remember to push the throttle back up when you achieve the
       desired position.

           3.6.2 Two-Ship Tactical Turns. Two-ship tactical turns are accomplished IAW
           AFMAN 11-251, Volume 1, except as noted here. Expect flight leads to have solid
           wingman consideration; however, they will fly wherever required to accomplish the
           mission. This means that turns may not be exactly 180°, 90° or 45°. As tactical turns
           are initiated, you should assume standard turn amounts, however, continue to monitor
           and fly off of lead during the remainder of the turn. This will allow you to make
           corrections early and still roll out in position.
           The contract for tactical turns is MIL power and G to hold airspeed (normally 350
           knots calibrated airspeed [KCAS]). When in level flight between 10,000 and 18,000
           feet, this will be approximately 80° of bank and 3 Gs. However, not all turns are level
           (for example, climbing between BFM sets), and sometimes turns are initiated from
           nonstandard positions and/or energy states (for example, just after a BFM set). A
           constant cross-check of the flight lead is necessary so that you can match their turn
           rate, radius, and line-of-site rate (LOSR) and end up in the proper formation.
           3.6.3 Visual Lookout. One of the most compelling reasons to fly tactical formation is
           to increase the effectiveness of our visual lookout in the tactical scenario. Despite our
           advanced radars, radar warning receivers (RWR) and off board SA enhancers such as
           Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), it is possible for an enemy to
           achieve an undetected entry into our combat formation. Therefore, you need to
           exercise a disciplined visual lookout to detect threat aircraft before they can achieve a
           weapons engagement zone (WEZ) on any member of the formation. Figure 3.1 shows
           the priority of visual lookout for both members of the formation. It is important to
           remember that we operate in three dimensions. Therefore, every sector of the visual
           lookout must be scanned not only level with your own jet, but higher than you, and
           lower than you. As a result, each sector depicted in Figure 3.1 can be divided up into
           three vertical sectors as well. It is also important to pause in each sector allowing your
           eyes to focus at range and detect movement. The environment, threats, weather, and
           other factors may alter the visual search responsibilities of each member of the flight.
           For instance, at low altitude, checking 12 o’clock and own ship altitude are very high
           priorities.
3.7 Four-Ship Tactical Formation. Four-ship tactical formations build on the basics of two-
ship formations. These formations are typically used to efficiently maneuver two elements to
mass firepower and maximize offensive and defensive capabilities. Four-ship tactical formations
include: Wall, Fluid-4, Container, and Offset-Container. Each of these formations have
advantages based on the tactical situation and must be flown proficiently. Typically, number 2
will set the stack. Number 3 will stack opposite of number 2, and number 4 will stack further in
the opposite direction. To maximize the advantages of each of these formations, all flight
members should strive to maintain visual with the other flight members. As a minimum,
wingmen MUST maintain visual with their respective element leads.

3.8 FENCE Check. FENCE IN/OUT is a directive call made by the flight lead to set cockpit
switches as appropriate prior to entering/exiting the combat or working airspace. Unit standards
and/or the flight briefing will dictate what items are to be accomplished during FENCE checks.
Normally it will require multiple intracockpit switch actuations.
     3.8.1 FENCE IN. Do not forget your priorities as a wingman: visual, formation, radios. It is
     likely that the formation will be maneuvering during the FENCE check. As a technique,
     ensure you are in the proper formation, decide what switch needs to be changed and reach
     for it; make a quick glance inside the cockpit to ensure you have the correct switch; and
     make the actuation as you are cross-checking and fixing your formation position. Repeat
     until all required items are accomplished for the fence check.
     3.8.2 FENCE OUT. The same principles apply to the FENCE OUT. Expect to be task
     saturated as your flight lead may simultaneously direct the FENCE OUT, a rejoin, and
     frequency change. Chair fly before the flight and task prioritize once airborne.
3.9 G Exercise. The G exercise serves several purposes. First, it gets your mind and body used
to the high-G environment. Second, it gives the pilots a chance to practice their AGSM with no
distractions from tactical maneuvering. Third, it gives the pilots a chance to make sure the
systems on the jet continue to function normally under G. Finally, it gives the student a fresh
reference for lift vector (LV) and nose position pictures and aircraft feel that will be used during
tactical maneuvering. Emphasis should be to focus on performing a good AGSM. The G-
exercise is not an instrument maneuver and will require looking outside the cockpit to deconflict
with other aircraft. Starting parameters for the G-exercise are LAB (striving towards 6,000 feet)
and 420+20 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). During the turns, constant adjustments to the LV
will be required to maintain approximately 420 KIAS and the required G.
     3.9.1 G Warmup. Select MIL power, roll to approximately 100 of bank, and pull to 4 to
     4.5 Gs. Initially, this will bring the nose in a downward vector, towards a pitch picture of
     2/3 ground and 1/3 sky. You will then need to reset the LV to slightly above the horizon to
     sustain airspeed and G. For the G warmup, this equates to approximately 8 to 12 nose
26                                                     AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009

     low. Another reference which might help is to roll to drag the top of your HUD along the
     horizon. In any case, adjust LV as required to get the correct G and airspeed combination.
     3.9.2 G Awareness. This turn is flown at 5 to 5.5 G/single rate beeper and serves to
     continue to prepare the pilots, check the function of the aural warning system for Gs, and
     give the pilots a feel for the initial G to be used for BFM break turns. Roll to approximately
     120 to 135 of bank, and select MIL power and blend in the G. For a sustained nose
     position reference, the horizon should be near the “high” mirror (this is about 15 to 25
     nose low). Manage LV in the same manner as the G warmup while sustaining G.
     3.9.3 Formation Considerations. While the G exercise will be initiated from LAB
     formation, there are special considerations for station keeping between the G warmup and G
     awareness. After rolling out of the first G-awareness turn, maintain MIL power and climb.
     Setting the FPM to approximately 3° to 5° should maintain 420 KIAS. Simultaneously,
     check into or away from lead to remain 4,000 to 6,000 feet. If not LAB, DO NOT attempt to
     accelerate or slow down to return to LAB. Instead, your priority is the correct airspeed for
     the second turn and setting range from your flight lead. Once both turns are complete, if not
     in LAB formation, maneuver to get back into position
AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               27


                                             Chapter 4
                                        AIR TO AIR (A/A)

4.1 Introduction. Success in visual A/A combat depends on the ability of the fighter pilot to
maneuver the aircraft into a position from which ordnance can be employed against the
adversary. BFM is the efficient application of aircraft handling skills to either attain a position
from which weapons may be employed, deny the adversary a position from which weapons may
be launched, or defeat weapons employed by the adversary. Note: For the remainder of this
chapter, the adversary will be referenced as the “Bandit.”
4.2 BFM Axioms. There are three basic axioms of BFM that apply to any situation. Whether
offensive, defensive, or high aspect (neutral), the following three concepts apply to every
situation. They are:
   Lose Sight, Lose the Fight
   Maneuver in Relation to the Bandit
   Energy versus Nose Position
     4.2.1 Lose Sight, Lose the Fight. In a fight where both aircraft are moving faster than 400
     miles an hour, it takes only a few seconds for an object with a total apparent surface area of
     just a few feet (like a T-38C approaching head on or flying away) to disappear completely.
     Additionally, most of the world’s air forces apply paint schemes to increase the difficulty of
     keeping sight of their airplanes. Just a couple seconds of not seeing the Bandit can mean the
     difference between victory and death. It will be necessary to occasionally take eyes off the
     Bandit during a fight. Learning when to take eyes off is critical. Offensively, you cannot
     shoot at an enemy you don’t see. It is relatively easy to keep track of a Bandit that is in front
     of you. However, defensively, an enemy that you cannot see is at liberty to shoot you while
     you are unable to defend yourself. There will be times in DBFM when the Bandit flies
     behind your seat; knowing when and where to get the tally back will be paramount. Do
     everything possible to prevent going no joy, but if a no-joy occurs, strive to get the tally
     back! In high aspect BFM, the Bandit will be at greater ranges during the fight than
     offensive and DBFM. Keeping sight will require a visual scan to stay outside of the cockpit
     for longer periods of time. As a general rule, stay padlocked on the Bandit until: 1) it is
     predictable, 2) it is easy to see, and 3) it is not threatening you. If in doubt, stay padlocked
     and don’t look inside the cockpit.
     4.2.2 Maneuver in Relation to the Bandit. Nearly all maneuvering must be in relation to
     the Bandit. That means every time you do something with your airplane, it must be either a
     reaction to what the Bandit has done, or preferably, to drive the fight and cause the Bandit
     to react to you. All the basic BFM concepts apply no matter what the attitude of your
     airplane is, so maneuvering in relation to the horizon becomes less important in most fighter
     type aircraft. Exceptions to this rule include utilizing the effect of gravity to your advantage
     and maneuvering to avoid the floor, or in actual combat, the ground. Offensively, and at
     high aspect, maneuver in relation to the Bandit to arrive in the WEZ based on your position
     relative to the Bandit. Defensively, maneuver in relation to the Bandit to keep him from
     arriving in a WEZ. Regardless of the situation, you must maneuver in relation to the Bandit
     in order to defeat him. However, due to lack of performance in the T-38, you must
28                                                       AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009

     maneuver in relation to the horizon as well as the Bandit to achieve the best performance
     from the jet.
     4.2.3 Energy Versus Nose Position. The last axiom of BFM is knowing when to fight an
     energy fight and when to fight a nose position fight. This boils down to either sustaining the
     current total energy state or cashing energy in for nose position to shoot or defend against
     weapons employment. Although high-performance A/A ordnance and helmet-mounted
     sights greatly expand WEZs, it is usually true that you cannot shoot someone unless your
     nose is pointed at them. That is why it is so important to know when to concentrate on the
     energy state of the jet and when to concentrate on its nose position. During OBFM, you
     generally maintain energy until you decide to employ ordnance in a controlled manner for a
     high probability of kill (Pk) shot. You then use nose position to employ ordnance.
     Defensively, you concentrate on the Bandit’s nose position. When the Bandit threatens you,
     cash in energy to defeat his ordnance. When his nose no longer threatens you, concentrate
     on maintaining or regaining energy to keep him from pointing at you. In high aspect, you
     concentrate on energy when you want to maintain a high turn rate over time, and cash in
     that energy for nose position when you want a small turn radius or an increased
     instantaneous turn rate to employ or deny ordnance. No matter what kind of fight you are in,
     at any given moment you should always know whether energy or nose position is more
     important.
4.3 BFM Concepts. BFM is not a set of canned maneuvers; rather, it is a dynamic combination
of rolls, turns, and maneuvers to either create or solve a BFM problem. BFM problems can be
created in range, angles, and closure. Each BFM selected is based on solving or creating a
problem while maneuvering in relation to another aircraft. The time and amount of BFM
required depends on ordnance load, threat reaction, and pilot skill. BFM concepts include terms,
which provide a common baseline for BFM discussions.
     4.3.1 Geometry. Understanding several key geometric terms and conditions are crucial in
     understanding one aircraft's position relative to another.
     4.3.2 Range. Range is the distance by which the two aircraft are separated.
     4.3.3 Aspect Angle (AA) (Figure 4.1). AA describes the relative position of the attacker to
     the target without regard to the attacker's heading. AA is defined as the angle measured
     from the tail of the target to the position of the attacker. From a defensive point of view, this
     angle is commonly regarded as the AOT.
     4.3.4 Heading Crossing Angle (HCA) (Figure 4.2). HCA is the heading difference
     between two aircraft. With converging vectors HCA can be measured up to a maximum of
     180° for a head-on pass. HCA is also referred to as “angle-off.”
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                           29


Figure 4.1. Aspect Angle.                           Figure 4.2. HCA.




    4.3.5 Antenna Train Angle (ATA) (Figure 4.3). ATA is the angle measured from the nose
    of one aircraft to the position of the other aircraft. Like AA, ATA is independent of the
    heading/longitudinal axis of the other aircraft, and commonly referred to as “angle off nose
    (AON).”
    4.3.6 Angle Off Tail. (Figure 4.3). AOT is the angle from the longitudinal axis of your
    airplane to the Bandit, as measured from your tail. Note: When the fighter is defensive,
    AOT and the AA you are showing the Bandit are the same. IFF instructors will use these
    terms interchangeably when discussing assessment in the DBFM phase.

     4.3.7 Pursuit Curves (Figure 4.4). The three pursuit curves are lead, pure, and lag. The
     attacker's nose position and LV placement determine the pursuit curve being flown in
     relation to the defender's plane of motion (POM) (see paragraph 4.3.11). If the attacker is in
     the defender's POM, the position of the attacker's nose determines the pursuit curve. When
     the attacker is out of the defender's POM, the pursuit curve is determined by where the
     present LV will position the aircraft's nose once entering the defender's POM.

Figure 4.4. Pursuit Curves.




           4.3.7.1 Lead Pursuit. (Nose in Front of the Bandit) All else equal, lead pursuit
           increases closure, increases AA, and decreases range. This pursuit curve is typically
           used offensively during gun employment and, from a defender’s perspective; it helps
           to generate closure and/or angular problems.
           4.3.7.2 Pure Pursuit. (Nose on the Bandit) Pure pursuit is useful from an offensive
           perspective when attempting to achieve a radar lock (boresight) and/or shoot certain
           missiles. Pure pursuit outside the Bandit’s turn circle (TC) increases closure (but at a
           more moderate rate than lead pursuit), aspect, and AOT. Maintaining pure pursuit
           inside the Bandit’s TC will continue to increase closure, AA and AOT until less than
           a turn radius from the Bandit. When less than a turn radius from the Bandit, closure
           and angles will increase until the offender either runs out of energy to maintain pure
           pursuit, or must flow to lag to avoid hitting the defender.”
           4.3.7.3 Lag Pursuit (Nose Behind the Bandit). Normally, lag pursuit decreases
           closure, decreases AA, and increases range. Lag pursuit is often used in BFM to build
           turning room (TR) and control overtake. Excessive lag does, however, remove
           pressure from the Bandit. From an offensive perspective, lag pursuit can help control
           closure, range, and angular problems. Defensively, a Bandit in lag pursuit may offer
           opportunities to gain energy.
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             31

    4.3.8 Turn. Turning allows the pilot to solve range, angle, and closure problems
    offensively, and to present the same problems defensively. For best turn performance, use
    available G to solve the problem with an acceptable specific power (Ps) bleed off. How well
    the aircraft can turn (turn rate and radius) is a function of TAS and available G. See
    paragraph 4.4 for a detailed discussion of power and energy management.
          4.3.8.1 Rate. Turn rate is defined in terms of the number of degrees per second
          (deg/sec) of heading change on a given TC. All else being equal, the aircraft with the
          higher turn rate travels around the circle quicker and either generates or solves BFM
          problems better than the aircraft with the slower turn rate.
          4.3.8.2 Radius. Radius is one-half the size of an aircraft's TC. All else being equal,
          the aircraft with the smaller turn radius is capable of creating/solving problems in
          range, closure, and angles better than the aircraft with the larger turn radius.
          Offensively, a smaller turn radius permits a turn inside the defender’s TC to achieve a
          weapons solution while maintaining an offensive advantage. Defensively, a smaller
          turn radius will deny a weapons solution and force the offender to fly outside the TC
          (assuming both aircraft remain in the same POM).
    4.3.9 LOSR. LOSR is the speed with which the LOS is changing. Fighter pilots also use
    LOSR for assessment during BFM. LOSR describes the Bandit’s apparent motion across
    the canopy as observed by the pilot sitting in the cockpit. For example, an airplane that is
    flying perpendicular to your flightpath and in front of you may have an LOS from left to
    right.
Figure 4.5. LOSR.




     During BFM, we describe the LOS with regard to direction and rate. It is important to
     remember that LOSR is relative to your aircraft. LOS is also described with respect to rate.
     A Bandit that moves aft very quickly has a high LOSR aft, while a Bandit that moves
     slowly toward the front of your jet has a low forward LOSR. The actual motion of the
     airplane may be different than the LOSR (Figure 4.5). Use LOS direction and rate to
     determine where you are in relation to the TC, and also to determine what the Bandit is
     doing for the purposes of predicting what he will do next. It is very important to keep track
     of the LOSR of the Bandit during the fight. LOSR is generally described as either forward
     or aft. Forward LOSR means the Bandit’s apparent motion is from the back of your jet to
32                                                  AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009

     the front. That is to say, from the tail to the nose. Aft LOSR is just the opposite. The
     Bandit’s apparent motion is from your nose to your tail. LOSR is not dependent on the
     Bandit’s heading, pursuit curve, or AA.
     4.3.10 Control Zone (CZ) (Figures 4.6 and 4.7). The CZ is defined as having 2,500 to
     4,500 feet of slant range and within a 25° to 45° cone.
Figure 4.6. The Control Zone.

AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                           33


     4.3.11 LV (Figure 4.8). Roll and yaw allows the pilot to position the LV (a line
     perpendicular to the wings out the top of the canopy to infinity), thus determining the
     POM in which the aircraft will turn. POM is the plane the aircraft is traveling through and
     will vary with the given LV placement, amount of yaw present, angle of attack (AOA), G,
     and airspeed.

Figure 4.8. LV versus POM.




     4.3.12 Turning Room. Turning room is any displacement from the Bandit's flightpath in
     any plane. The goal is to take advantage of available TR to either gain a position of
     advantage against a defender or create problems for the offender. An important point to
     remember is that TR for the attacker is also TR for the defender in most cases. Exclusive
     TR, however, exists when one aircraft can take advantage of TR but the other cannot (for
     example, in a high-aspect, low-altitude pass where the high fighter is less than one TC
     above the ground and the low fighter is executing a pure low-to-high conversion. In this
     case, a majority of the TR is usable only by the low fighter since the high fighter would
     strike the ground if attempting to use it).
         4.3.12.1 Offensive. The goal of the offender is to take full advantage of TR that
         cannot be denied by the Bandit, which when inside the TC, is in the Bandit’s POM. If
         needed, the offender can build TR in the Bandit’s POM by using lag pursuit.
         Whenever the Bandit’s POM changes, it may provide the offender with additional TR
         the Bandit cannot use due to relative energy states.
         4.3.12.2 Defensive. With the Bandit outside the defender’s TC, the defender can deny
         the attacker TR by turning with the LV on or near the Bandit. Once the attacker is
         inside the TC, the defender can only deny TR if the Bandit is out of the defender’s
         established POM, energy allowing (for example, the offender enters the TC 500 feet
34                                                     AETCTTP11-1        4 SEPTEMBER 2009

           above the defender’s POM. The defender can only deny TR by changing the POM
           upward toward the offender).
           4.3.12.3 High Aspect. Premerge, high-aspect TR may be in the vertical, horizontal,
           or a combination of both. Turning room is not always equally usable by both fighters,
           as discussed previously. The goal of each fighter approaching a high-aspect merge is
           to use TR to reduce HCA prior to the merge (for example, take lead turn).
4.4 Power and Energy Management. Power affects airspeed and therefore turn radius and rate.
Power is also used to control energy. Energy provides the potential to maneuver. Nonoptimal
energy levels (usually expressed in airspeed) can result in degraded turn performance, reduced
time in weapons parameters, or greater exposure to threat weapons. Expend available energy
only as required for offensive advantage (that is, kill the Bandit), defensive necessity (that is,
deny Bandit WEZ/CZ), or merge preparation. Otherwise, strive to maintain or gain energy as the
situation allows.
     4.4.1 Energy Maneuverability (EM) Diagram (Figure 4.9). In BFM with all other
     variables equal, the more maneuverable aircraft usually has a better chance of winning. All
     BFM involves turning, and generally the tighter turning aircraft (radius) that can turn the
     greatest number of degrees over a specified time period (rate) has the advantage. Engineers
     have translated the data for use in EM diagrams which depict an aircraft’s rate of turn, turn
     radius, and energy bleed rate at a given weight, throttle setting, altitude, airspeed and G-
     loading. By comparing the EM diagrams, it can be determined who has the advantage, and
     where that advantage lies in terms of altitude and velocity. Figure 4.9 shows the diagram for
     a T-38 at gross weight = 10,155 pounds and ALT = 15,000 feet and MAX afterburner.
     There are some important points on the EM diagram to be familiar with. Along the bottom
     axis is the airspeed. G is depicted by the blue lines. The placard G limit is 7.0 Gs. The
     curved line (labeled MAX LIFT) that runs down the left side of the diagram is the lift limit
     line. The area bounded by the max lift limit, placard G limit, and placard airspeed limit is
     the flight envelope. To read the diagram, enter from the bottom with airspeed and follow it
     up to one of the G-load lines that run from the upper left to the lower right. At the
     intersection of G and airspeed, reference the rate, shown on the left, and parallel to the
     radius lines up and to the right for turn radius.
            4.4.1.1 Ps. Inside the flight envelope, every point defined by an airspeed and G
            loading has an associated energy gain or loss. They are measured by negative or
            positive feet per second, are numerated in hundreds of feet per second, and represent
            a measure of the energy bleed or gain rate. If the energy bleed rate is negative, it
            means that to sustain the current G load and airspeed, the aircraft must descend
            (change potential to kinetic energy) at the depicted rate. These lines are often
            referred to as excess power or Ps lines.
            4.4.1.2 Turn Rate. Along the left, vertical axis is the turn rate. Rate is measured in
            degrees per second and graduated every 2. A turn rate of 12 per second means the
            nose will transit through 12 of turn in 1 second at the G load and airspeed depicted.
            If in a horizontal turn, this would mean 12 of heading change. If pulling in the pure
            vertical it would mean 12 of vertical attitude change. Note that, up to
            approximately 380 knots, the rate increases with airspeed.
AETCTTP11-1      4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                           35


Figure 4.9. T-38 EM Diagram.




         4.4.1.3 Radius. Turn radius is depicted by the straight lines that run from the lower
         left to the upper right of the diagram. They are measured in thousands of feet and
         graduated every 1,000 feet. Note that, assuming a constant airspeed, the radius
         decreases as G is applied until the aircraft reaches either the maximum lift or the
         maximum G available.
         4.4.1.4 Corner Velocity (Figure 4.10). The very peak of the diagram is the
         instantaneous corner velocity. This is where maximum allowable G intersects with
         the lift limit line and depicts the slowest airspeed at maximum G can be applied.
         Instantaneous corner velocity can be approximated by referencing the G line and
         finding the intersection with the lift limit line. (Reference the red-dashed circle in
         Figure 4.10). Instantaneous turn capability comes at a cost, however, in the form of
         negative Ps.

Figure 4.10. Corner Velocity.




           4.4.1.5 Comparing EM Diagrams. When comparing fighter performance,
           overlaying the EM diagrams will determine areas of strength and weakness for both
           aircraft. This provides a good idea of the flight regime to engage the adversary. For
           instance, if one aircraft is superior at higher altitudes, that pilot should try to keep the
           fight high. If the other aircraft has a superior sustained rate, the pilot would strive to
           fight a rate fight. At IFF, the adversary is also flying the T-38C, but by restricting use
           of throttle and/or G, advantages are available to the unrestricted aircraft in the form of
           increased rate and decreased radius and less bleed rate during the turn (reference
           Figure 4.9 to see the red and blue circles). A typical advantage enjoyed during an IFF
           engagement is approximately 2°/second and about 800 feet in radius. 2°/second over
           360° of turn (about 28 seconds) equals 56° of advantage.
4.5 BFM Cross-Check. During a BFM engagement, we need to keep track of two things in
order to be successful. First, we need to monitor our own aircraft performance to execute our
game plan. Second, we need to monitor the Bandit’s position relative to us and their actions to
successfully fight them. Just as we use an instrument cross-check to monitor several parameters
at once while flying instruments, we use a BFM cross-check to monitor our performance and the
Bandit’s actions during BFM. Depending on the phase and the nature of the fight (defensive,
offensive, or high aspect), our cross-check will emphasize different items. Each will be discussed
later relative to specific engagement circumstances.
     4.5.1 Fighter Cross-Check. During an engagement, we are usually trying to max perform
     our jet to create the highest turn rate and the smallest turn radius. G, LV, and airspeed all
     affect the rate and radius of our turn in a T-38. Therefore, these three things form the
     foundation of the fighter cross-check. While fighting, we also need to monitor our own fuel
     state and the floor.
     4.5.2 Bandit Cross-Check. The Bandit cross-check consists of range, AA, AOT (plan
     form), HCA, LOSR, and closure. These parameters will telegraph the Bandit’s game plan.
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             37

4.6 Offensive BFM (OBFM). OBFM trains the fighter pilot to maneuver from a position of
advantage to a controllable WEZ and kill the Bandit. OBFM is a sequential set of problems
solved by the offender to arrive at a controllable WEZ and employ valid ordnance to kill the
Bandit in the minimum amount of time. Offensive BFM requires a well thought-out and
executed game plan based on fighter and Bandit capabilities, training, and proficiency. The
primary objective of OBFM is to kill the Bandit. Subobjectives further define the overall
objective of KILL. Standard OBFM objectives are:
   KILL
    - Maneuver to the CZ.
    - Transition to a WEZ.
    - 100 percent valid weapons employment.
   Maintain the offensive.
    4.6.1 OBFM Perch Setups. The current IFF syllabus requires two basic perch setups for
    OBFM: 6,000-foot perch setups and 3,000-foot perch setups. The primary difference is the
    fighter starts outside the Bandit’s TC on the 6,000 setup and inside the Bandit’s TC on the
    3,000 setup.
          4.6.1.1 6K Perch Setup. Per the standard setup, the fighter starts 6,000 OBFM from
          6,000 feet behind the Bandit at 30° to 40° of AA. Squadron standards dictate how to
          arrive at this position, but the flight lead normally directs the wingman to 9,000 feet
          LAB at the planned “FIGHT’S ON” airspeed. The flight lead checks both aircraft to
          the right or left so the fighter turns toward the Bandit. As the fighter reaches pure
          pursuit, the Bandit reverses the turn and sets the appropriate aspect angle. The fighter
          monitors the range and calls the fight’s on at 6,000 feet. The fighter holds the Bandit
          under the gun cross until he reaches 6,000 feet and continues to modulate power to
          maintain the briefed “FIGHT’S ON” airspeed. For a T-38C, the wingspan is 4 mils at
          6,000 feet. This is one mil larger than the inside gap of the gun cross and one mil
          smaller than each side of the horizontal arms of the gun cross. The AAT will display
          1.1 nautical miles (NM) due to system lag.
          4.6.1.2 3K Perch Setup. This setup is applicable to short-range BFM and the quarter
          plane exercise. Initial position before the check turn is 350 knots, 6,000-foot lateral
          spacing, stacked level with the Bandit. At the check call, the offender checks towards
          the Bandit to achieve pure pursuit. The offender maintains pure pursuit on the Bandit,
          modulating power to maintain 350 knots until 3,000-foot range is achieved. At 3,000
          feet, the Bandit’s wingspan will be 8 mils. The AAT will display 0.6 nm due to
          system lag. The offender calls out “EASE” or “TIGHTEN” as appropriate for aspect
          outside the 30° to 40° window.
    4.6.2 OBFM Exercises:
          4.6.2.1 Offensive Ranging Exercise. Begin the offensive ranging exercise from a
          6,000-foot setup. Pure pursuit the Bandit until reaching the 6,000-foot HUD
          reference. Roll out to view lag pursuit for 1 to 2 seconds, select MIL power, and place
          the Bandit back under the boresight cross. Continue to pure pursuit until reaching the
          3,000-foot HUD reference. Note the details on the Bandit’s jet at 3,000 feet as these
          references are important for OBFM. At 3,000 feet, the Bandit has a clearly visible
          canopy and canopy bows, distinct lines where the wings and tail meet the fuselage,
38                                                  AETCTTP11-1        4 SEPTEMBER 2009

          and clear lines where the colors on the paint scheme change. At 3,000 feet, continue
          to pull the Bandit down the HUD until the Bandit’s wingspan fills the gunsight.
          Modulate power for steady, controllable overtake until reaching reposition cues.
          Reposition to avoid the 1,000-foot bubble and, as the Bandit reverses, maneuver to
          remain at 1,000 feet to view the Bandit references at the bubble.
          4.6.2.2 Heat-to-Guns Exercise (Figure 4.11). The objective of the heat-to-guns
          exercise is 100 percent valid weapons employment. Units will determine specific
          setup parameters and special instructions (SPINS) for the heat-to-guns exercise.

Figure 4.11. Heat-to-Guns Exercise.




          4.6.2.2.1 Communication. Reference specific communications guidance in unit
          standards.
          4.6.2.2.2 Bandit. At the “FIGHT’S ON” call, the Bandit will initiate a MIL power, 4-
          to 5-G level turn away from the maneuvering aircraft. At 90° of turn, roll out, and
          modulate power. As soon as a Fox 2 is called by the maneuvering aircraft, the Bandit
          will either immediately reverse the turn (if still checking away) or continue in the
          same direction and maintain 3 to 4 Gs while slowing to 350 KCAS and MIL power.
          4.6.2.2.3 Maneuvering Aircraft. At the “FIGHT’S ON” call, select MAX
          afterburner, set the LV on the Bandit, start the AGSM, and perform best break turn.
          As the Bandit enters the HUD field of view (FOV), simultaneously relax the G, and
          attempt a valid AIM-9 shot. Call “FOX 2.” Then prepare to enter the Bandit's TC.
          4.6.2.2.4 AIM-9 Employment. When pulling the Bandit into the HUD, consider a
          slight relax of G as required to slow the Bandit’s LOSR to the missile seeker FOV.
AETCTTP11-1    4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             39

       With the target’s heat source in the missile FOV, uncage the missile by depressing the
       NWS button. Attempting to hold or freeze the Bandit in the center of the seeker FOV
       for too long can result in a significant closure problem and decrease the time available
       to prepare for follow-on maneuvers. Firmly depress the pickle button to fire the AIM-
       9 and confirm missile launch by witnessing the removal of the reticle (evidence of
       employment can also be checked by referencing the missile count in the bottom left
       corner of the HUD). After employing the AIM-9, call “FOX 2,” roll out, and begin a
       slight climb (normally flightpath marker [FPM] 3° to 5° above the horizon) to avoid
       the Bandit's jetwash. Modulate power to accelerate or maintain airspeed while
       approaching the Bandit’s TC.
       4.6.2.2.5 TC Entry Recognition Cues. Recognizing the proper TC entry cues proves
       vital to successfully entering the CZ. The maneuvering aircraft is on the TC when AN
       INCREASE IN THE AFT LOSR of the Bandit occurs. Another recognizable cue
       occurs when the rotational motion of the Bandit turns into aft translational motion
       (AA stops increasing). Due to the low turn rates of the T-38, this increase in LOSR is
       relatively subtle.
       4.6.2.2.6 Maneuver to the CZ. At the TC entry, select G and power as appropriate
       (usually MIL) to maneuver to the Bandit's CZ. Begin the AGSM, set the LV near the
       Bandit, and start a light to moderate buffet pull. As the Bandit approaches the canopy
       bow, begin to assess range and aspect. The area within two fists of the canopy bow is
       the “assessment window.” Range and aspect should look appropriate for transition to
       the gun WEZ. Avoid the potential of flying through jetwash by maneuvering either
       above or below the Bandit’s POM while flushing towards the Bandit’s tail.
       4.6.2.2.7 Assessing for a WEZ. When the Bandit reaches the canopy bow, assess
       range, aspect, and closure. The canopy bow assessment should occur approximately
       one to two fists above the canopy bow. Commonly briefed cues to search for during
       this assessment include 3,000 feet of range, 30° of aspect, and steady, controllable
       closure (referred to sometimes as the “rule of threes”). Details on the Bandit's jet
       provide the most accurate method to determine range. At 3,000 feet the Bandit has a
       clearly visible canopy and canopy bows, distinct lines where the wings and tail meet
       the fuselage, and clear lines where the colors on the paint scheme change. To
       determine 30° to 45° of aspect, refer to the wingspan-versus-length relationship. (See
       Figure 4.11.) To determine acceptable closure, the Bandit's jet should slowly grow
       larger. If his jet is rapidly growing larger or smaller, improper closure exists. If all
       three cues from the Bandit exist at the canopy bow assessment window, continue to
       pull the Bandit into the HUD and employ ordnance.
       4.6.2.2.8 Ease Reposition (Repo). If the range, aspect, and closure cues are not met
       at the canopy bow assessment window, execute an ease repo to drive the range and
       aspect lower. An ease repo drives the maneuvering aircraft back toward the Bandit's
       TC, reducing range and aspect in the process. Execute an ease repo by relaxing back-
       stick pressure to reduce G. Modulate power as required to maintain the desired rate
       fight airspeed. When reducing G, the fighter will see aft LOS from the Bandit (away
       from the canopy bow) as well as a reduction in aspect. Expect LOS to be immediate,
       although the amount of time required during the ease will vary based on the range,
       angles, and closure presented by the Bandit at the time of the ease. Select MAX
40                                                AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009

     afterburner, reset the LV for best rate, and blend the G back in. Maintain the best rate
     until the Bandit again enters the canopy bow assessment window. Assess and either
     execute another ease repo or pull G as required to enter the AIM-9/gun WEZ.
     4.6.2.2.9 Gun Employment. A valid gun track opportunity requires proper POM,
     lead, and range during bullet time of flight. After deciding the attack cues are met,
     smoothly pull the Bandit into the HUD between the boresight cross and the AIM-9
     FOV circle. Placing the Bandit in this position solves for POM. Next, establish the
     proper lead by matching the Bandit’s wingspan to the width of the funnel. Finally,
     assess the range by comparing the Bandit’s location in the funnel with the 2,500-foot
     pipper. While pulling the Bandit to the proper lead, range, and POM, the Bandit may
     pass through the AIM-9 FOV circle; if so, take a shot of opportunity as required.
     Prior to opening fire with the gun, ensure your feet are on the floor or exerting
     symmetric pressure on the rudder pedals. Unintentional yaw inputs will cause POM
     errors. Using fine muscle movements, stabilize your aiming reference on the center of
     the target aircraft. Adjust power as required based on closure, aircraft buffet cues, and
     LOSR. To open fire, use one smooth, continuous trigger squeeze per gun attempt.
     Intermittent pulsing of the trigger will minimize the Pk and will jam the 20mm
     cannon. Small adjustments in back-stick pressure and lateral stick displacement will
     be required to refine aiming based on continuously changing range and POM. Adjust
     for POM error using lateral stick pressure by attempting to adjust for one-half the
     distance of firing evaluation display system (FEDS) or lead computing optical sight
     (LCOS) pipper displacement. A controlled gunshot should be held for a 2-to-3 second
     lethal burst. This time may be shortened based on range, closure, and significant
     aiming errors. To terminate the gun attempt, RELEASE the TRIGGER prior to
     commencing a repo. Marksmanship is critical: at 60 rounds per second, your 450
     rounds of simulated bullets will be depleted in approximately 7 seconds.
     4.6.2.2.10 Repo Mechanics. While employing the gun, the maneuvering aircraft may
     encounter the need to repo. The maneuvering aircraft should repo for frag from a
     valid gun kill, or range and closure problems created during the gun attempt. Range
     and closure problems are the most common reason for the maneuvering aircraft to
     repo. The repo is a calculated bid to lag, using the vertical and induced drag to solve
     range, aspect, and closure problems. The goal of the repo is to transition back to the
     CZ.
     4.6.2.2.10.1 Initial Move. Rotate the LV away from the Bandit; power placement,
     degree of LV change, and G/AOA used will depend on the severity of the closure
     problem the maneuvering aircraft is trying to solve. If unsure, a good default is to use
     idle, set the LV 60° to 90° above the Bandit (typically, perpendicular to the horizon)
     and use a smooth but deliberate pull to the moderate buffet.
     4.6.2.2.10.2 Transition Back to the CZ. The repo is not finished after the initial
     move. Once arriving on or near the Bandit’s TC, begin pullback towards the Bandit to
     reduce HCA and begin the reassessment. Throttle position will depend on LOS and
     range cues from the Bandit.
     4.6.2.2.10.3 Recommit from the CZ. Once established in the CZ with valid
     assessment cues, recommit for an AIM-9 opportunity on the way back to the gun
AETCTTP11-1     4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             41

        WEZ. Use power as required, to include MAX afterburner, and place LV as required
        to position the nose for valid weapons employment. Where the LV is placed will
        depend on how much vertical the Bandit is using. The fight will go downhill in
        pursuit of the WEZ and a low yo-yo may be required to increase/maintain energy for
        nose rate. Be aware of position relative to the training floor during the recommit.
        Based on the assessment, if valid attack cues are not met, remain in or maneuver back
        into the CZ before attempting another WEZ.
        4.6.2.3 High-Angle Guns-to-Separation (HAGS) Exercise. Begin the HAGS
        exercise from a 6,000-foot setup. Call “FIGHT’S ON” at 6,000 feet. Begin an AGSM
        while selecting MAX afterburner and setting the LV in plane with the Bandit.
        Smoothly pull to 5Gs and blend to single-rate beeper (SRB. The Bandit will disappear
        beneath the nose of the aircraft. Continue to pull for 4 to 5 seconds. Roll out and
        modulate power for the briefed airspeed while reacquiring the Bandit. The Bandit
        should be level on the horizon and outside the canopy bow. As the Bandit approaches
        the canopy bow, squeeze the trigger and hold until the Bandit reaches the edge of the
        HUD. Select MAX afterburner; reset the LV to the Bandit’s deep 6 o’clock; and
        smoothly pull to either moderate buffet or SRB. Approximately 90° of heading
        change is required for a ballpark separation heading with a dive angle of 20°. Upon
        reaching this heading, look over the opposite shoulder to acquire the Bandit and
        update heading as required to place the Bandit at 6 o’clock. Modulate power to stay
        below the Mach while executing a floor transition.

        4.6.2.4 Quarter Plane Exercise. This exercise starts from a 3,000-foot setup. The
        objectives are to maintain 3/9 line advantage. At the “FIGHT’S ON,” maneuver the
        aircraft as to maintain pipper on the Bandit until the quarter plane picture is achieved
        shortly before reaching the bubble. At the quarter plane picture, set LV away from the
        Bandit (“feet on the Bandit”), select idle power, and execute a MAX performed pull
        to stop forward closure.
   4.6.3 OBFM Sets:
        4.6.3.1 Medium-Range OBFM (6,000-Foot Perch Setup). The 6,000-foot OBFM
        setup begins outside the Bandit’s TC and CZ.
        4.6.3.1.1 Objective. The objective is to kill the Bandit. A commonly desired learning
        objective is to accomplish the kill within 720° of turn.
        4.6.3.1.2 Game Plan. The initial game plan is to fly towards the Bandit’s TC, execute
        an on-time TC entry, and assess for the ability to enter the Bandit's WEZ.
        4.6.3.1.3 Initial Move. When the Bandit begins his break turn at the “FIGHT’S ON,”
        the fighter is outside of the Bandit’s TC. The fighter must drive to the Bandit’s TC in
        order to fly CZ BFM. Rolling out and pointing to the Bandit’s location at the
        “FIGHT’S ON” is the easiest way to drive to his TC. While rolled out and in level
        flight, the fighter must begin power modulation to arrive at the Bandit’s TC with the
        briefed airspeed. Typically, standing up the throttles maintains this airspeed, but
        additional power modulation will be required if the “FIGHT’S ON” airspeed was
        slightly fast or slow. Finally, the fighter must recognize and enter the Bandit’s TC.

     4.6.3.1.4 TC Entry Recognition Cues. Recognizing the proper TC entry cues proves
     vital to flying effective BFM. In any fighter, fighting any Bandit, from any range
     setup, the fighter is at the TC when AN INCREASE IN THE AFT LOS RATE
     OCCURS AND THE AA OF THE BANDIT STOPS INCREASING. Due to the low
     turn rates of the T-38C, the initial increase in LOSR and the AA increase is relatively
     subtle compared with more maneuverable aircraft. Rapid increase in Bandit LOS is
     the primary TC entry cue, but a few crutches exist to help see this sight picture. The
     most common crutch uses the Bandit reaching the inside edge of the rearview mirrors
     on the canopy bow. Other crutches include counting 2 to 3 seconds after rolling out at
     the “FIGHT’S ON,” or starting the turn when the Bandit reaches 11 or 1 o’clock.
     These crutches only work under the specific conditions of a T-38C fighting a T-38C
     from a 6,000-foot setup with 30° to 40° of AA where the Bandit executes a 5G break
     turn.
     4.6.3.1.5 TC Entry Mechanics. Upon seeing the TC entry cues, begin the AGSM,
     select MAX afterburner, and use 1G roll to set the LV. An LV setting to slightly
     below the Bandit brings the fighter’s nose below the horizon and sets up for an
     effective rate right. After setting the LV, return the stick to neutral and smoothly
     apply aft stick until reaching 5Gs. Physical cues for 5Gs include the G-awareness
     feeling and inflation of the G-suit. Once reaching 5Gs, smoothly blend the aft stick
     pressure to obtain light buffet, airspeed sustaining feel. Cross-check the HUD to
     ensure airspeed is remaining steady. Continue to hold the POM on the Bandit (LV
     slightly above the Bandit) and maintain the airspeed while watching for LOSR cues
     from the Bandit. A quick laundry list of the actions that need to occur at the TC entry
     follows:
           AGSM.
           Power – MAX.
           LV - On to slightly below the Bandit.
           Pull to 5Gs and blend to light buffet feel.
     4.6.3.1.6 Maneuvering to the CZ. After entering the Bandit’s TC, the next step is
     to maneuver to the Bandit’s CZ. To do this, use the concept of the assessment
     window. This is the point on the canopy bow approximately one to two fists above
     the canopy bow where the Bandit’s range, AA, and closure can be assessed.
     Ultimately, continuous assessment of the Bandit is the goal, but the assessment
     window provides a defined snapshot point on the canopy bow. Until the Bandit
     reaches the assessment window, the majority of the BFM cross-check should split
     between the Bandit and own ship parameters of power, LV, G, and airspeed. Bandit
     LOSR is another effective tool to judge rate fight success. Bandit LOS toward the
     canopy bow indicates one of two things. In an aligned TC rate fight, it indicates a
     winning rate fight as long as it is not occurring as a result of bleeding own ship knots.
     In the misaligned TC rate fight, this indicates apexing outside the TC and starting to
     point back inside the Bandit TC (See Figure 4.12). Bandit LOSR away indicates the
     exact opposite—a losing rate fight with an aligned TC or flushing outside the Bandit
     TC in a misaligned TC rate fight. The assessment window occurs as the Bandit is
     pulled down to one to two fists above the fighter’s canopy bow. This position allows
     the fighter to determine whether or not they are established in the heart of the
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                              43

          Bandit’s CZ (30 AA and 3,000 to 3,500 feet). From the assessment window the
          fighter can determine which BFM steps to take next.
Figure 4.12. Estimating AA.




          4.6.3.1.7 Assessing the Bandit. When the Bandit reaches the assessment window,
          analyze his range, aspect, and closure. Commonly briefed cues to search for include
          3,000 feet of range, 30° to 45° of aspect, and steady, controllable closure (referred to
          sometimes as the “rule of threes”( Figure 4.13). Details on the Bandit’s jet provide the
          most accurate method to determine range. At 3,000 feet, the Bandit has a clearly
          visible canopy and canopy bows, distinct lines where the wings and tail meet the
          fuselage, and clear lines where the colors on the paint scheme change. As a crutch,
          ~0.5 to 0.6 on the AAT is a good cross-check of ~3,000 feet. To determine 30° of
          aspect, refer to the wingspan-versus-length relationship discussed in paragraph 4.2.
          To determine acceptable closure, the Bandit’s jet should slowly grow larger. If his jet
          is rapidly growing larger or smaller, improper closure exists. If all three cues from the
          Bandit’s jet are seen in the assessment window, continue to pull the Bandit into the
          HUD and kill. If one or more of the cues are not met, execute an ease repo as
          described in paragraph 4.6.3.1.8. An ease repo will help solve range and aspect
          problems by realigning TCs.
          4.6.3.1.8 Ease Repo. If the range, aspect, and closure cues are not met at the
          assessment window, execute an ease repo to drive the range and aspect lower. An
          ease repo drives the fighter’s jet back toward the Bandit’s TC, reducing aspect in the
          process. Execute an ease repo by relaxing back-stick pressure to reduce G, freezing or
          reversing the Bandit's LOS. Closure and AA will decrease. Hold the ease repo until
          aft LOSR increases. (TC entry cue). Select MAX afterburner, reset the LV on the
          Bandit, and blend the G back in. Maintain the airspeed sustaining feel until the Bandit
          again enters the assessment window. Assess the Bandit again, and either execute
          another ease repo or trade energy for nose position in order to employ ordnance.
          4.6.3.1.9 Transition to a WEZ. This series of MAX performance turns, assessments,
          and repos establishes the fighter in the heart of the Bandit’s CZ. From this position,
          the fighter can employ high Pk weapons. Though the gun is the weapon of choice for
          killing the Bandit during OBFM, take advantage of any AIM-9 opportunities when
          the Bandit is in the HUD.
          4.6.3.1.9.1 POM. Additionally, due to own ship maneuvering, the Bandit may
          actually be in a POM that requires a climb to position the Bandit in the HUD. In order
44                                                    AETCTTP11-1        4 SEPTEMBER 2009

          to maintain the energy and ability to collapse the range while preserving energy, pull
          to ensure lead before aligning the POM and expect a throttle setting of MAX
          afterburner to "climb the hill" to the Bandit's POM.

Figure 4.13. Canopy Bow Assessment: High AA at ~3,000 Feet (Offset TCs).




          4.6.3.1.9.2 Throttle Techniques. To prevent excessive overtake, reduce power based
          on the degree of LOSR towards the HUD. At light buffet feel on the jet, if the Bandit
          is marching quickly towards the HUD, pull the power to IDLE when the Bandit is
          between the canopy bow and the HUD. If the LOSR is slow with light buffet pull,
          reduce power commensurate with that LOSR. Once the Bandit is in the HUD, reduce
          power based on the jet feel required to hold the Bandit in the correct amount of lead
          for the gunshot; a "smooth" jet-to-light buffet will only require IDLE power; light-to-
          moderate buffet will normally require throttles "stood up"/MIL power; moderate-to-
          heavy buffet will normally require MAX afterburner.
          4.6.3.1.10 Missile and Gun Mechanics. Reference the detailed discussion on
          weapons employment in paragraph 4.6.2.2 (heat-to-guns exercise).
          4.6.3.1.11 Repositioning From the Gunshot. Four factors drive the need to repo
          from a gunshot: range, AA, closure, and G. Range includes both maximum and
AETCTTP11-1    4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             45

       minimum ranges. The repo must occur in time for the fighter to remain outside the
       TR bubble. Exact timing depends upon AA and closure but usually occurs between
       1,500 feet and 1,800 feet. Training rules permit gunshots well outside comfortable
       AAs when employing a T-38C. When AA increases above 60 (Bandit’s length twice
       his width), repo to prevent excessive closure. As aspect increases, angular closure
       also increases. Additionally, any difference in airspeed between the fighter and
       Bandit creates closure. If the Bandit’s jet is rapidly growing larger, repo to prevent a
       Bandit reversal opportunity. Finally, if fighter is in MAX afterburner and moderate
       buffet with no LOSR towards HUD and not enough lead required for the gunshot,
       adequate radial G is not available. Repo to regain energy and reestablish a CZ
       position. To execute the repo, select idle, use 1G roll to set the LV to 90° out of the
       Bandit’s POM (should be almost straight up),and pull to moderate buffet or SRB.
       Wait for standard TC cues (LOSR away and AA stops increasing), then select MAX
       afterburner and set LV on the Bandit. Assess the Bandit’s reaction to the repo. The
       Bandit either continues the turn or attempts to reverse to a neutral or offensive
       position. Bandit LOS away from the HUD indicates the Bandit is continuing the turn.
       Little to no LOS combined with the Bandit resetting his LV toward the fighter
       indicates a Bandit reversal.
       4.6.3.1.11.1 Bandit Continues the Turn. An effective repo at 1,500 feet to 1,800
       feet will force a smart Bandit to continue his turn. Continue to pull to 90° out of the
       Bandit’s POM to force LOS and reverse the turn to arrive back in the heart of the CZ.
       Ensure MAX afterburner, use 1G roll to set the LV on the Bandit, and smoothly pull
       to moderate buffet until the Bandit enters the assessment window. During this pull,
       adjust the LV as required based upon the altitude available to sustain a moderate
       buffet turn. Cross-check the floor and begin a floor transition as required. As the
       Bandit enters the assessment window, reassess the attack cues and either pull the
       Bandit to the HUD for a kill or execute another repo as required to solve the range,
       aspect, or closure.
       4.6.3.1.11.2 Bandit Reverses. A Bandit reverses in an attempt to go neutral or
       offensive. If the repo occurred early enough for the fighter to return to the CZ, the
       Bandit’s reversal presents an opportunity for a quick AIM-9 or gun kill. Capitalize on
       the Bandit’s mistake with valid weapons employment. If the Bandit reverses at a
       closer range, fight to maintain 3/9. Roll at 1G, reorient the LV to 90° out of the
       Bandit’s POM and pull to moderate buffet. Select MAX afterburner to maximize nose
       rate and gain an altitude advantage over the Bandit. A Bandit that reverses within one
       aircraft turn radius forces the fight into a scissors. Reference the DBFM section for
       scissors mechanics.
       4.6.3.1.12 6K OBFM Contingencies:
       4.6.3.1.12.1 Fighter No Joy. Most no-joy situations in OBFM occur from the
       fighter’s improper BFM cross-check. After recognizing the no-joy situation,
       simultaneously lag the Bandit’s last known position while calling “No Joy” and
       clearing flightpaths. Expect a “Continue” call from the Bandit and scan the Bandit’s
       last known position to reacquire the tally. If at any time safety of flight is in doubt,
       call “KNOCK IT OFF” IAW the training rules.

     4.6.3.1.12.2 Bandit Tighten Down (TD). A Bandit with available energy will TD as
     the fighter’s nose approaches pure in order to create aspect and closure problems for
     the fighter. Recognize a TD with the increased aspect and closure created by the
     Bandit. If the Bandit tightens down while still outside the HUD, execute an ease repo
     to solve the aspect and closure problems. If the TD isn’t recognized until the Bandit is
     inside the HUD, execute a larger repo to fly back to the Bandit’s CZ. The Bandit will
     be at a lower energy state post TD and less likely to create significant problems
     through subsequent TDs.
     4.6.3.1.12.3 Bandit Jinks. Jinking Bandits are discussed in more detail in the 3K
     OBFM section (paragraph 4.6.3.2.11.3). Use the same techniques in 6K OBFM to
     defeat a jinking Bandit as in 3K OBFM. In general, assess the Bandit’s jinks for
     effectiveness and either employ weapons if ineffective or repo if effective.
     4.6.3.1.12.4 Floor Transition. A smooth floor transition sustains energy for a
     fighter’s floor fight while a floor save depletes energy in order to remain above the
     floor. Recognize an approaching floor through a proper BFM cross-check of altitude
     and not avionics warnings. One technique for beginning a floor transition is the 10°
     rule. Begin the floor transition 1,000 feet above the floor for every 10° of dive angle.
     For example, at 20° nose low, begin the floor transition 2,000 feet above the floor.
     4.6.3.1.13 Floor Fight. Hold airspeed instead of G during a floor fight for best rate.
     Use any TR above the floor to maximize rate. Be patient as the maximum nose rate
     for a floor fight will be less than a normal fight, but the Bandit’s turn performance is
     affected by the floor as well.
     4.6.3.2 Short-Range OBFM (3,000-Foot Perch Setup). The 3,000-foot OBFM
     setup begins inside the Bandit’s CZ.
     4.6.3.2.1 Objective. The objective is to kill the Bandit. A common desired learning
     objective is to accomplish the kill within 540° of turn.
     4.6.3.2.2 Game Plan. The initial game plan is to attempt a gun shot while assessing
     the Bandit’s initial reaction.
     4.6.3.2.3 Initial Move. At the start of the 3,000-foot BFM engagement,
     simultaneously roll to place the LV on the Bandit while evaluating the Bandit’s
     defensive response. With the LV on or slightly below the Bandit, aggressively
     increase G to pull lead to solve the gun solution (POM, range, and lead). Power
     settings are based on aircraft feel, relative LOSR, and closure.
     4.6.3.2.4 The Bandit Who Breaks Level or Jinks Up. If the Bandit fails to
     maneuver out of plane and/or does not jink effectively to create closure problems, the
     offender should be in a position to continue the gun attack. In the 3,000-foot OBFM
     setup, gun range is nearly solved requiring a momentary pause to get to 2,500 feet.
     Refine POM by maneuvering the aircraft as to place the gun cross “+” on the HUD
     along the Bandit’s extended flightpath and establish the requisite amount of lead to
     take the shot. Continue to assess for cues to repo.
     4.6.3.2.5 The Bandit Who Jinks Downhill. The Bandit may jink down and into the
     offender to spoil the gun solution and create a closure problem. Preserve TR by
     executing a repo to control closure velocity (Vc). The repo should include
AETCTTP11-1    4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            47

       momentarily setting the LV back to the Bandit's CZ, pulling away to help generate
       LOS away (from the offender), and then aggressively realigning the TCs. Following
       the TC entry, select MAX afterburner and set the LV initially halfway between the
       Bandit and the horizon. Execute a moderate buffet turn shy of the wing rock or just
       short of the stall turn to follow the Bandit’s extended flightpath. Cues of max
       performing the aircraft during the turn include moderate buffet and airspeed not
       increasing. Continue to adjust LV and pull while maneuvering back into a position (in
       the CZ) to assess for a WEZ opportunity.
       4.6.3.2.6 CZ Maneuvering. Once established in the CZ, most of the BFM concepts
       from medium-range BFM apply (paragraph 4.6.3.1.6).
       4.6.3.2.7 Follow-on Maneuvering. In addition to the concepts and considerations
       discussed in the medium-range section (paragraph 4.6.3.1), consider the following:
       4.6.3.2.7.1 Repos. The repo is a lag maneuver designed to reduce AA, increase range,
       and decrease closure. Some reasons for executing a repo include: Bandit blows up,
       excessive closure, approaching briefed minimum slant range (i.e., bubble), or Bandit
       changes the POM. If closure is excessive, a high aspect gunshot is attempted, or a
       BFM error occurs, a flightpath overshoot may be imminent. The first key is to
       preserve the offensive by recognizing the potential overshoot early, and performing
       an out-of-plane lag maneuver called a quarter plane.
       4.6.3.2.7.2 Quarter Plane Maneuver. After recognizing a potential overshoot, roll to
       place the LV 90° out of the Bandit’s POM and execute a moderate buffet pull shy of
       the wing rock/stall in idle power to arrest closure and try to generate LOSR away.
       Once the overshoot is controlled, visualize the CZ and fly to that point by placing the
       LV back on the Bandit and turning to align the fuselages.
       4.6.3.2.7.3 Bandit Reversals. During the quarter plane, the defender may reverse,
       placing his LV on or near you and executing a maximum performance turn. In this
       case, continue to analyze where the defender's CZ is and pull towards it so as to avoid
       the bubble. Your goal in this situation is to regain the offensive advantage by
       outperforming the Bandit and minimizing your forward ground track. There are two
       ways to do this: the tree and the scissors. Both minimize forward ground track in
       different ways. The tree (both high and low) minimizes the forward ground track with
       airspeed. In the scissors, minimizing forward ground track is accomplished by turning
       your jet with a minimized turn radius. To determine which to enter, the HCA at the
       flightpath overshoot must be assessed. Anything <120° of HCA will result in a tree.
       Greater than 120° of HCA at the overshoot will result in a scissors.
       4.6.3.2.7.3.1 Tree. The fighter should select IDLE power initially and set the LV to
       level flight. Pull to the moderate buffet shy of the stall/wing rock and reapply MAX
       afterburner at ~175 to 200 knots in order to catch around 150 to 160 KIAS. The tree
       is now established. To get back to an offensive position, remain loaded at moderate
       buffet shy of the wing rock and attempt to fly shallow ‘S’ turns using rudder only
       (ailerons will drop the wing and result in loss of subsequent lift). Attempt to stay
       within 2,000 feet vertically of the Bandit as any more vertical is nearly impossible to
       use in the T-38. The combination of the slow airspeed and the ‘S’ turns will lead to a
48                                                       AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009

           minimized forward ground track. Once greater than 3,000 feet of lateral spacing is
           achieved behind the Bandit, transition to OBFM.
           4.6.3.2.7.3.2 Scissors. For HCA greater than 120° at the flightpath overshoot, the best
           way to minimize forward ground track is by entering a scissors. To enter the scissors
           at the flightpath overshoot, place the LV just above the Bandit such that the fighter
           will not encroach on the bubble. If possible, place the LV on the Bandit. Any higher
           placement of the LV will open the turn radius in relation to the Bandit and increase
           forward ground track. Once the LV is set, select MAX afterburner and pull to the
           moderate buffet shy of the wing rock/stall to minimize the turn radius. Ensure bubble
           deconfliction approaching the following flightpath overshoot and reverse at the TC
           entry cues (rapid LOSR increase across the ground and AA stops increasing). By
           better performing the jet in MAX afterburner and moderate buffet shy of the wing
           rock, the Bandit will have a larger forward ground track. Once ~2,500 feet of lateral
           spacing behind the Bandit is achieved, transition to OBFM.
           4.6.3.2.8 3K OBFM Contingencies:
           4.6.3.2.8.1 Fighter No Joy. Offensive maneuvering remains the same as medium-
           range BFM. The fighter must ensure strict adherence to training rules with respect to
           communications and fighter maneuvering.
           4.6.3.2.8.2 Closing in Lag. If the fighter fails to max perform the aircraft post initial
           repo, the resulting increased turn radius and airspeed can generate cues of closing in
           lag where the fighter creates a faster turn rate along a larger circle. This is indicated
           by AA and range decreasing with the nose still in lag. The end result if allowed to
           continue will be insufficient weapon separation. Once recognized, the first corrective
           action is to attempt to max perform the aircraft, specifically more AOA. If closing
           cues are recognized late, then a repo will be required to maneuver back to the CZ.
           This lag repo is essentially the same as a one-fourth plane—select IDLE power, roll
           to 90° out of the Bandit’s POM and pull to the moderate buffet shy of the wing rock
           while waiting for range to open and LOSR away.
           4.6.3.2.8.3 Jinking Bandit. Anytime the Bandit attempts to jink, the Bandit is
           expending energy to spoil POM. At high energy states, these jinks will be very
           effective at spoiling POM. Follow-on jinks will start with decreased energy, resulting
           in less effective changes to POM. If the Bandit’s jinks are assessed to be effective
           enough to spoil POM, the fighter should repo to preserve TR and seek a quick follow
           on WEZ for a Bandit with a depleted energy state.
4.7 Defensive BFM (DFBM). The goal of DBFM is to train the fighter pilot to survive while
maneuvering from a position of disadvantage. The correct mindset is critical to DBFM, and a
will to survive is paramount. Unlike offensive, DBFM requires the pilot to max perform the
aircraft, while spending increased time looking backwards. The focus should be on surviving for
as long as possible and creating problems for the Bandit based upon your current situation. So
long as you are still alive and have a working aircraft around you, you are winning. NEVER
GIVE UP! In addition to the proper attitude, you must be able to visually identify (ID) the
aircraft behind you ("is that a MIG-25 or an SU-27?"). Likewise, you must know both the threat
aircraft and the pilot's capabilities. At what altitudes/airspeeds does your aircraft outperform his?
What types and how many missiles does he carry? How far off-boresight can he shoot those
AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                              49

missiles? Is his gun canted up or down (or does he have a gun at all)? The fighter pilot must
know this information before the engagement begins. The Bandit WEZ for IFF is depicted in
Figure 4.14. Bottom Line: Know the threat before you fight it. In order of priority the objectives
in DBFM are:
        SURVIVE.
        Defeat the Initial Attack.
        Deny Subsequent WEZ.
        Defeat Subsequent Weapons.
        Neutralize, Separate, or Go Offensive.

     4.7.1 Perch Setups. Perch setups will be executed IAW the squadron standards and/or IFF
     Playbook. The “push it up” mechanics will be the same as OBFM. Since it is imperative
     that you see the Bandit during the fight, you need to position your body to obtain the
     maximum rearward visibility. While on the ground, maneuver in the cockpit to ensure you
     can visually see the opposite horizontal stab. This will equate to the required body position
     under G in order to maintain the tally. During the setup, rotate your upper body and adjust
     body position to ensure the stick and throttles are still accessible for full range of motion. A
     common technique is to lean forward and look "around" the seat back. Do not attempt to
     support the weight of the head and helmet by neck muscles alone. The second common
     error is to look forward under heavy G and then relax the Gs in order to look back at the
     Bandit. Improper body positioning during G-onset can lead to a loss of tally and possibly
     even injury.

Figure 4.14. IFF Bandit WEZ.




            4.7.1.1 6K Perch Setup. Once “ready,” the flight lead will direct a check turn into the
            fighter. After turning 45, roll out wings level. Maintain level flight and
            simultaneously prepare for the defensive body position and begin to assess the
            Bandit. At this point, it is fundamental to begin a cross-check between the Bandit and
            one’s own ship parameters. Wait until the Bandit has achieved pure pursuit to reverse
            the turn. The defensive fighter will be responsible for maintaining the airspeed
            contract, remaining level, and setting 30 to 40 of AOT. This will require you to start
50                                                    AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009

          your DBFM cross-check during the fight setup. While looking backwards, assess and
          correct AOT (Figure 4.15). At 30 to 40 AOT, the Bandit should be above the
          wingtip. A common technique is to put the Bandit a fist distance away from the rear
          canopy bow and two fingers above the horizon. During the setup, occasionally
          reference the HUD and focus on airspeed (setup dependent) and the FPM to ensure
          level flight. Initially, your time will be divided equally between looking backwards
          and glancing at the HUD. However, the closer you get to the “FIGHT’S ON,” the
          more time you should spend looking at the Bandit, ready for the initial move.
          4.7.1.2 3K Perch Setup. Unlike the 6K defensive setup which requires the defender
          to maintain the same briefed airspeed as the pre “check” airspeed, the 3,000 feet setup
          requires slowing down. Decelerating from 350 knots and arriving at the “FIGHT’S
          ON” with less than 320 knots and 30° to 40° of AOT is a challenge. During the initial
          check turn, modulate power and pull to the buffet to bleed down to 320 to 330 knots;
          then allow the jet to decelerate the last 5 to 15 knots with throttle modulation after
          you have reversed your turn and have set the desired AOT.
     4.7.2 DBFM Exercises:
          4.7.2.1 Defensive Ranging Exercise. Start from a standard 6K perch setup with the
          following exception: the Bandit will pull pure from 9,000 feet to 6,000 feet and then
          call “FIGHT’S ON” at 6,000 feet. At this point, the Bandit will roll out momentarily
          showing a “lag” pursuit curve. Then the Bandit will pull “pure” and then “lead”
          closing into a valid gun WEZ. The Bandit will continue closing the range and fly
          behind the fighter to not enter the 1,000-foot bubble.
          4.7.2.1.1 Purpose. To familiarize the student with the defensive perch setup and to
          identify and practice assessing pursuit curves and ranges. The pure pursuit Bandit
          from 9,000 to 6,000 feet that is approaching the 6,000 feet “FIGHT’S ON” range is
          designed to calibrate long range estimation. Bandit pursuit course after momentarily
          driving to lag at 6,000 feet is designed to have primary emphasis on WEZ recognition
          (Figure 4.14). The Bandit will show “lag, pure, lead,” and drive all the way to the
          bubble. See Figure 4.16 for defensive assessments of Bandit pursuit curves.
          4.7.2.1.2 Mechanics. After the check away, reverse back when offender is pure to
          maintain tally/altitude/airspeed. Power modulate to slow from 415+10 knots to 350
          knots while slightly descending. Hold Bandit at 30° to 40° AOT (approximately 2.5
          to 3 Gs). The primary task is Bandit assessment. Assess pure, lag, and the transition
          from lag to pure to lead as range decreases. In addition, assess the cues indicating the
          Bandit is in the AIM-9 WEZ (pure) and gun WEZ (lead). As the Bandit approaches
          the bubble, he will repo to lag. Roll out, wings level and quickly move your visual
          scan from to the opposite side of the aircraft. You will see the Bandit on the opposite
          side of the canopy, just outside the bubble (1,000 to 2,000 feet with low HCA). The
          exercise will end with a Terminate or KIO call.
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            51

Figure 4.16. Bandit Lag Assessment.




          4.7.2.2 Reversal/Scissors Exercise:
          4.7.2.2.1 Purpose. The purpose of the reversal/scissors exercise is to recognize and
          defend against a Bandit that continues to pull lead, identify the reversal picture, and
          execute a reversal. Following the reversal, the exercise continues with an entry into a
          scissors fight to gain the 3/9 advantage from the Bandit.
          4.7.2.2.2 Initial Move. Execute a defensive break turn and assess the Bandit’s pursuit
          curve. However, recognize that the Bandit will transition from pure to lead for a high-
          aspect gun attempt as he approaches a high-angle gun WEZ. Prior to the Bandit
          achieving pure pursuit, execute an out-of-plane maneuver to defeat the gun attempt.
          Assess the Bandit’s position for a reversal opportunity.
          4.7.2.2.3 The Reversal. As the Bandit overshoots, assess the Bandit's LOSR, range,
          and HCA. There are several combinations of range and HCA that could present a
          reversal opportunity; high HCA combined with close range (generally inside of 2,000
          feet) and/or high LOS may allow for a successful reversal. Figure 4.17 shows two
          typical reversal pictures: the lower HCA, repo near the bubble, and the higher HCA,
52                                                   AETCTTP11-1        4 SEPTEMBER 2009

         rangier result of a Bandit attempting a high-angle gunshot. If in doubt, do not reverse
         and continue to turn while monitoring the overshooting Bandit.

Figure 4.17. Two Common Reversal Pictures.




         4.7.2.2.4 Reversal Mechanics. Simultaneously use an unloaded roll to reverse your
         turn and move your visual scan to the other side of the canopy to regain the tally. LV
         position will depend on HCA and LOS when the reversal is initiated. The higher the
         HCA and LOS, the closer to the Bandit you can initially place your POM to use as
         much of the in-plane TR as possible. With low HCA and LOS, you must ensure POM
         is not on the Bandit to prevent pressing the bubble. In this case, whether you place
         your POM above or below the Bandit will depend on his nose position. If the Bandit
         already has the high ground, go low and vice versa. Reference scissors mechanics in
         the OBFM section (paragraph 4.6).
         4.7.2.3 Jink Exercise:
         4.7.2.3.1 Purpose. The purpose of the jink exercise is to identify the Bandit’s gun
         WEZ and practice guns jinks. Jinks are last-ditch maneuvers to spoil POM and create
         closure.
         4.7.2.3.2 Mechanics. Prior to the “FIGHT’S ON,” maintain setup parameters.
         Primary emphasis should be on assessing Bandit range for WEZ (Figure 4.14). At the
         “FIGHT’S ON,” immediately select IDLE power, unload and roll to set LV below the
         Bandit. Perform an aggressive symmetric, maximum onset rate, two-hand, stick in the
         lap pull and hold until the aircraft aerodynamically stalls. Assess the Bandit. If the
         Bandit is still in lead, jink again. You must break the AOA prior to resetting the LV.
         Be careful not to push forward on the stick as you reset your POM as this may
         introduce negative Gs. While maintaining IDLE power, reset LV out of plane (OOP)
         with the Bandit (opposite vertical side of Bandit from the first jink). Perform another
         aggressive symmetric, maximum onset rate, stick in the lap pull using two hands, and
         hold until the aircraft aerodynamically stalls. Assess the Bandit. Continue jinking
AETCTTP11-1     4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            53

        until the Bandit repos. The Bandit will continue to threaten until forced to repo,
        presenting a reversal picture. Reverse and maneuver to gain 3/9. Reference reversal
        and scissors mechanics from OBFM. Power as required when necessary for own ship
        EM to ensure effective maneuvering. Use caution jinking down within 1,500 to 2,000
        feet from the floor.
   4.7.3 DBFM Sets:
        4.7.3.1. Medium-Range DBFM (6,000-Foot Perch Setup). The Bandit begins
        slightly inside of your TC and outside the CZ.
        4.7.3.1.1 Objective. The objective is to survive.
        4.7.3.1.2 Game Plan. The game plan is to execute a break turn and assess the
        Bandit's reaction.
        4.7.3.1.3 Initial Move (The Break Turn). To survive this engagement, the first thing
        you must do is Defeat the Initial Attack. You do this by rotating your WEZ away
        from the Bandit's WEZ. Execute a defensive break turn, looking over your shoulder at
        the Bandit to assess his pursuit curve. Select MAX afterburner, set the LV on or
        slightly below the Bandit, and pull to target G; 5.0 to 5.5. The G should feel the same
        as a during G-awareness maneuver. Continue to “squeeze” the G to the SRB and
        simultaneously assess the Bandit’s pursuit curve. Due to power and G limitations, the
        Bandit will be forced immediately outside of your TC. For the AIM-9P, more than
        45° of AA is needed to defeat the missile, or prevent the Bandit from taking the shot.
        The break turn should be LV on and at max allowable G to generate as many angles,
        minimize vertical TR for the Bandit, and maintain airspeed. Figure 4.9 shows an
        additional advantage of a max performance turn while the Bandit is outside your TC.
        Each second the Bandit is outside your TC, you will generate 12 to 13 more degrees
        of turn, which are angles the Bandit will has to make up once he enters your TC.
        Once the Bandit is on/inside your TC, your rate advantage will decrease to about 2°
        (assuming a 10.5 to 11 degrees per second (deg/sec) Bandit turn rate). MAX
        performing your aircraft is essential in maintaining this advantage and achieving the
        objectives.
        4.7.3.1.4 Pure/Lead Bandit. If the Bandit continues in pure pursuit or pulls lead,
        immediately transition to a TD maneuver. Timely assessment of this pure/lead Bandit
        is critical as he is only moments away from employing ordnance. In this case, you
        will not see LOS aft and the Bandit’s AA will not change. To transition from the
        defensive break turn to a TD maneuver, continue the break turn mechanics while
        raising the LV to on the Bandit and apply max allowable G. Continue to assess the
        Bandit. Continue to pull max allowable G to the buffet as you slow down. You will
        see forward LOS and range decrease as the Bandit approaches a WEZ. Prepare for
        guns defense. Recognizing the WEZ and honoring the Bandit’s nose with guns
        defense is paramount. The Bandit who stays pure will have a fleeting snap at the back
        edge of the WEZ. Your cue to start the OOP will be pure pursuit with range
        collapsing inside of 3,000’. The Bandit who aggressively pulls lead will have a high-
        angle snap shot at a closer range. Mechanics for these pictures will be IAW paragraph
        4.7.2.2 (Reversal/Scissors Exercise).
54                                                    AETCTTP11-1        4 SEPTEMBER 2009

          4.7.3.1.4.1 OOP Components. There are two components to this OOP: (1) Change
          POM to defeat the gun attack, and (2) continue to assess the Bandit for follow-on
          game plan selection (i.e., reverse or continue the turn in a min radius fight).
          4.7.3.1.4.2 OOP Mechanics. Quickly reduce G to break AOA and reset the LV to get
          OOP and smoothly pull back to the moderate buffet. If the Bandit is below you and
          you’re looking at the top of his jet, consider an OOP uphill. This moderate buffet pull
          will immediately create problems for the Bandit and will require follow-on
          maneuvers (i.e., repo or high-aspect GUN attempt). Do not hesitate to transition to
          your follow-on game plan.
          4.7.3.1.4.3 Assess and Select a Game Plan. Assessment must occur during the OOP.
          If you see high LOS due to high HCA and/or close range, reverse (Figure 4.18). If
          you don’t, or are in doubt, continue with the turning fight and transition to a min
          radius game plan.

Figure 4.18. Reversal Cue, Lead Bandit.




          4.7.3.1.4.4 Reversal. Versus a Bandit that pulls excessive lead for a high-aspect gun
          attempt, you will see high HCA and can afford to initially roll your LV closer to the
          Bandit without pressing the bubble. Fight to gain a 3/9 advantage and look for WEZ
          opportunities. Refer to Reversal discussion beginning with paragraph 4.7.2.2.4.
          4.7.3.1.5 Lag Bandit. In order to transition from the defensive break turn to the
          sustained-rate game plan, you will need to refine your LV. Begin your DBFM cross-
          check, but don’t look forward for any longer than an occasional cross-check. Alter
          your LV as required to max perform the aircraft. Subsequently, refine your LV,
          striving for a sustained-rate fight airspeed and optimum rate fight.
AETCTTP11-1      4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            55

         4.7.3.1.6 Bandit Assessment. Continue to assess the Bandit; you will either be
         winning or losing the rate fight (Figure 4.19). Winning cues include: forward LOSR
         with range and HCA increasing (as you pull the Bandit into deeper lag). Losing cues
         include: aft LOSR with range and HCA decreasing.
         4.7.3.1.7 DBFM Cross-Check. Cross-check LV, G, and airspeed to refine your
         optimum rate fight. The following are common errors and their corrective actions:
         4.7.3.1.7.1 High Airspeed. Ensure max allowable G, apply a power reduction, and/or
         raise the LV to reduce airspeed. How much of each depends on the severity of your
         airspeed error. Take caution readjusting LV to prevent an asymmetric over-G.
         4.7.3.1.7.2 Low G. If you are holding 400 knots or less, but sustaining 5 or less Gs,
         your LV may be too high. Slowly move your LV lower and smoothly increase the G.
         Additionally, cross-check engine operation and throttle placement.

Figure 4.19. Winning and Losing LOS Cues.




         4.7.3.1.7.3 Getting Too Slow. The LV is too high, but in this case you have already
         traded your airspeed for G in an attempt to keep target G or better. Deliberately lower
         your LV towards the game plan pitch picture, or lower. You must include altitude in
         your BFM cross-check to build floor awareness. See Floor Transition (paragraph
         4.7.3.3.5). Additionally, cross-check engine operation and throttle placement.
         4.7.3.1.8 Separation (Figure 4.20). Whether out of ordnance or fuel, or in a multi-
         bogey environment, the overall tactical circumstances may demand that you leave the
         fight. Regardless, none of these reasons is worth giving the Bandit an easy AIM-9
         opportunity. Make sure your assessment is accurate and, if in doubt, don’t attempt the
         separation.
56                                                   AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009


Figure 4.20. Separation Cues.




          4.7.3.1.8.1 Separation Decision. If the Bandit is trending towards 90 of HCA
          (approximately 45 AOT and 45 plan form) and greater than 6,000 feet, consider
          separating. Trend information is important; you should see the Bandit getting smaller
          over time and lag increasing (Figure 4.20). A good range cue is to ensure the Bandit
          looks smaller than a T-38 in tactical formation and decreasing in size. Continue to
          assess the Bandit for winning and losing cues.
          4.7.3.1.8.2 Separation Execution. If the cues to separate exist but altitude and
          airspeed are unknown, take a glance forward and cross-check own ship parameters. If
          slow and close to the floor, reconsider separating. With awareness of airspeed and
          altitude, reassess the Bandit and if separation cues exist, leave the fight. Use MAX
          afterburner and unload to less than 1G to increase airspeed as quickly as possible. A
          technique is to leave the bank in during the unload to mask the separation longer.
          Attempt to maintain tally or awareness of the Bandit's nose position while keeping an
          eye on the pending floor transition. Use of a small check turn during the separation
          will assist in tracking the Bandit, although do not turn too much. Continue to monitor
          the Bandit nose position and dispense countermeasures as required to defend against
          potential weapons employment from the Bandit.
          4.7.3.1.9 Mature Fight Guns Defense. During the fight, if the Bandit demonstrates
          the ability to threaten with nose position, transition from the optimum rate game plan
          to OOP maneuvers. As soon as the Bandit's nose begins to rotate from lag towards
          pure at range, transition to the TD, flare, and get ready for guns defense.
          4.7.3.1.9.1 OOP Maneuver. The first priority is to recognize the Bandit WEZ and
          subsequently move the aircraft's POM out of the Bandit’s POM. Whether the first
          move is up or down will depend on altitude remaining to the floor. Ideally, use
          gravity to command a downhill maneuver, but if within 1,500 feet of the floor, a level
          or pullup may be more appropriate. The decision to select an OOP maneuver or a jink
          will depend on Bandit AA and closure. Assuming you execute an effective TD and
AETCTTP11-1    4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                57

       get AA to greater than 45°, expect to force the Bandit’s nose off with one OOP
       maneuver. If AA is less than 45°, you will likely need a series of jinks before the
       Bandit is forced to repo. Airspeed will also be a factor in game plan selection; full-up
       jink mechanics above 320 knots will increase over-G potential. (Reference paragraph
       4.7.3.2 for jink mechanics.)
       4.7.3.1.9.2 Post OOP/Jink. When the Bandit’s nose is forced to lag, look for reversal
       cues. If you see rapid LOS with high HCA and a Bandit inside approximately 2,000
       feet, reverse. If not, continue the turn. SA on altitude in relation to the floor is a must
       during a mature fight.
       4.7.3.2 Short-Range DBFM (3,000-Foot Perch Setup):
       4.7.3.2.1 Game Plan. “Jink and assess.” Initial Move: Set power to IDLE, rotate the
       LV OOP below and towards the Bandit while applying max allowable G. In order to
       expedite the OOP maneuver, attempt to use both hands to pull the stick towards the
       seat pan. The aircraft will aerodynamically stall as the nose of the aircraft digs in. Pay
       attention to the Bandit's nose during the jink. If it’s still pointed at you, a follow-on
       jink up is required while the Bandit is attempting to adjust to your newly set POM.
       Reset the LV approximately 90° back above the horizon and jink again. Continue
       jinking until the Bandit’s nose repos to lag. Assess for reversal cues.
       4.7.3.2.2 Jink Timing. Each jink needs to be held long enough to allow the aircraft to
       begin moving to a new POM. A delay in transitioning to a follow-on POM allows the
       Bandit to find a gun solution easily. Break the AOA prior to resetting the LV. Rolling
       the LV with AOA will not allow the aircraft to pivot around its flightpath axis quickly
       enough.
       4.7.3.2.3 Setting the LV. As the Bandit gets closer, POM adjustments must be
       further away from the Bandit. Remember that POM will always fall below the LV—
       as the aircraft slows down in subsequent jinks, the difference between the two will
       increase. The T-38 does not fly well with the nose buried low due to small horizontal
       stabilizers and limited thrust. As a technique, aim to place the LV approximately 45°
       above or below the Bandit to ensure adequate POM changes (Figure 4.21).

       4.7.3.2.4 Don’t Give Up. While the number 1 priority is initially getting OOP,
       emphasis must also include increasing aspect and closure to force the Bandit out of
       the WEZ. If jinks are weak and don’t generate closure, it may take several jinks
       before the Bandit is forced to lag.
       4.7.3.2.5 Follow-On Maneuvering. Your jink sequence will end with the Bandit in a
       repo. During the repo, assess for reversal cues.
       4.7.3.2.6 The Reversal. See paragraph 4.7.2.2.4 for specifics on cues and reversal
       mechanics. Be aware if you do reverse, HCA will probably be low, requiring your
       new LV towards the Bandit’s high CZ. You can quickly update it with a tally on the
       other side of the canopy if LOS, HCA, and/or range allow.
58                                                    AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009


Figure 4.21. 3K DBFM Jink Lift Vector.




         4.7.3.2.7 No Reversal Cues. If reversal cues are not present, immediately transition
         back to a max performing turn. Use MAX afterburner and set the LV as required
         below the horizon. This may require either a large LV change or none at all
         depending on if you were jinking above or below the Bandit when he repositioned.
         4.7.3.2.8 Pulling to Moderate Buffet. Continue pulling to the moderate buffet in
         MAX afterburner while maintaining awareness of the Bandit. Airspeed should stay
         approximately the same throughout the turn. Extreme nose low and high attitudes will
         affect airspeed. Snapshots to the HUD will be required over time to build SA on
         attitude and the floor; however, during the first few seconds of the transition to the
         min radius fight, you should concentrate on the tally.
         4.7.3.2.9 Maintain the Tally. Effective jinks followed by a quick transition to the
         min radius fight will allow you to maintain the tally. You should see plan form and
         low HCA. Keeping the tally will be extremely difficult unless you start the fight in a
         good body position and are timely with your game plan selection and execution.
         4.7.3.3 Mature 3K Fight. Stay with the turn and keep up with the DBFM cross-
         check, preparing for a floor transition. Carefully assess the Bandit for a transition to
         pure/lead and a threatening nose position. As the Bandit approaches an AIM-9 WEZ,
         flare and immediately transition to guns defense. (Reference mature fight guns
         defense, paragraph 4.7.3.1.9.)
         4.7.3.3.1 Future WEZ Expectations. Given the offset TCs, expect the Bandit to
         transition to another WEZ. As soon as you see the Bandit’s nose, begin to rotate from
         lag to pure at range, transition to a TD, flare, and get ready for another OOP and
         potential reversal opportunity. Despite the high probability of a second WEZ for the
         Bandit, it is possible that you are able to keep his nose in lag over time. In this case,
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             59

          there MAY be consideration for transitioning from your min radius fight towards a
          sustained-rate fight. If LOS is stagnant on the canopy and the Bandit’s nose is stuck
          in 45° of lag or more, with range opening to >4,000 feet, begin the transition to a rate
          fight. Relax G as much as Bandit will allow in order to gain energy (i.e., airspeed),
          but keep the Bandit from reentering a WEZ.
          4.7.3.3.2 Keep The Tally. You will have aft LOS towards your 6 o’clock, but it will
          slow down and stagnate near the tail and/or canopy bow (possibly under it).
          Reference Figure 4.22. Given the Bandit’s high offensive potential, if you lose the
          tally at this point, you stand a good chance of allowing the Bandit an unobserved
          WEZ entry. Regardless, DO NOT ease off the pull. If you momentarily go NO JOY
          with the Bandit under the canopy bow or behind the seat, sustain the G/AOA. Per AFI
          11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, you are allowed to TD with respect to
          “remain predictable” while “no joy.” The TD maneuver will help to reacquire the
          tally by pulling the Bandit forward on the canopy.
          4.7.3.3.3 No-Sight Defense. The primary goal of no-sight defense is to recover the
          tally while executing a min radius game plan. Make sure you spend the majority of
          your time scanning for the Bandit while maintaining a frequent cross-check to the
          HUD for altitude and attitude SA. MAX performing the aircraft in the min radius
          fight will provide the best opportunity to pull the Bandit forward on the canopy, and
          regain tally. Additionally, countermeasures dispenser (CMD) should be considered
          based on fight pacing SA.

Figure 4.22. Keeping the Tally.
60                                                     AETCTTP11-1          4 SEPTEMBER 2009

          4.7.3.3.4 Tally Recovery. SA on the Bandit’s HCA when he flies behind your seat
          will help you recover it. If HCA was low, look first and longest in the high Pk WEZ
          (Figure 4.23). If HCA was higher as the Bandit crossed your 6 o’clock, offset TCs
          will develop and as time goes on move your scan from the WEZ forward on your
          canopy, zigzagging both high and low.
          4.7.3.3.5 Floor Transition. The fight will be going downhill. Your goal is to slowly
          adjust your LV during a floor transition to eventually level off before reaching the
          floor. Without a floor transition, you will be forced to roll wings-level in a floor save,
          which is energy depleting and will straight-line your TC. This could be the difference
          between keeping the Bandit’s nose in lag or allowing him to point and employ
          ordnance. To execute an effective floor transition requires the fighter to incorporate
          altitude in the BFM cross-check. For every 1,000 feet above the floor, you should be
          no more than 10° nose low. This is referred to as the “10 percent rule.” As an
          example, with a 9,000-foot MSL floor, you should not be more than 20° nose low
          passing 11,000 feet. Additionally, consider using a 1,000-foot BARO setting above
          the BFM floor. This will allow for small errors in LV control during a floor fight.
          Remember that once at the floor you must fight Ps=0 BFM. Referencing the T-38 EM
          diagram, you can still see that at Ps=0 you won’t be able to sustain the same G as
          during the descending, rate fight. (The jet will feel smoother as you are further away
          from the lift limit line; reference EM diagram, Figure 4.9.)

Figure 4.23. Regaining the Tally.




4.8 High-Aspect BFM (HABFM). HABFMs may occur throughout many phases of a tactical
engagement. During the transition from the intercept to the BFM phase, the Bandit may have a
tally or may be turning into the attacker based on RWR indications, radar contact, or ground
controlled intercept (GCI) information. Always attempt to achieve TR prior to a merge. If the
Bandit is aware, the Bandit may deny any TR opportunities. Do not continue to try for TR and
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             61

lose the opportunity for a lead turn. Remember that TR for you is typically TR for the Bandit.
The Bandit may have a tally, and may attempt to achieve TR also.
    4.8.1 HABFM Concepts. The BFM concepts already introduced in the offensive and
    defensive phase will be expanded upon and some new concepts added as they apply to the
    high aspect arena. Unlike perch BFM which starts at specific parameters, HABFM is much
    more fluid and unpredictable.
          4.8.1.1 Premerge Turning Room. TR is displacement in any plane (vertical, lateral,
          or a combination) from an adversary’s flightpath (Figure 4.24). Prior to the lead turn,
          the fighter will seek to gain an advantage by “building” TR prior to the lead turn. The
          optimum amount of TR is a full turn diameter between you and your adversary’s
          flightpaths. In the T-38, we strive for at least 6,000 feet. It is important to realize,
          however, that TR for one fighter is normally TR that can be used by the adversary as
          well. There are exceptions to this rule. For instance, one fighter may have exclusive
          use of TR that the other fighter cannot use. An example of this exclusive TR is when
          two aircraft merge, high-aspect at low altitude, with one aircraft just above the ground
          and the other less than a turn diameter above the ground. The low fighter can execute
          a pure vertical lead turn; however, the higher aircraft cannot execute the same
          maneuver to match the lower aircraft. If he does, he will impact the terrain. Thus, the
          lower fighter enjoys exclusive use of this TR.
          4.8.1.2 Merge Entries. The decision to merge above or below the Bandit is
          dependent on several considerations to include environmental factors, current energy,
          and the surrounding tactical situation. Weigh all the factors and execute a decisive
          game plan.

Figure 4.24. Turning Room.
62                                                     AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009


          4.8.1.3 Lead Turn (Figure 4.25). The lead turn is an attempt to use TR to decrease
          HCA prior to passing the opponent’s 3/9 line. In an ideal situation, against an
          unaware, nonmaneuvering Bandit, the initial lead turn will result in the fighter rolling
          out in a WEZ at the Bandit’s 6 o’clock. If both aircraft are aware and simultaneously
          use the TR, the result will be a close aboard, neutral pass. In general, you want to gain
          TR before the merge or the Bandit becomes aware and begins to turn into you.
          However, if your adversary begins to take that TR away (they become an aware
          Bandit and turn into you), you must stop trying to get more TR and use what you
          have. The figures below are two dimensional, but HABFM will happen in three
          dimensions. In a pure sense, a lead turn that maximizes use of available TR will have
          POM on the Bandit regardless of where the LV is in relation to the horizon (specific
          LV considerations are discussed later).

Figure 4.25. Lead Turn.




          4.8.1.4 Energy Atom (Figure 4.26). 6K OBFM or DBFM engagements always start
          with the fighter and Bandit at the same altitude. Since the fighter’s nose position is
          near the horizon and will predictably lower, it is advantageous to start close to rate
          airspeeds. After the “check away” in HABFM, however, the fighter will intentionally
          maneuver to build in an altitude differential to gain vertical TR in addition to lateral
          TR. Regardless of power setting, the T-38 will quickly slow down maneuvering
          uphill and likely accelerate when going downhill. As a result the fighter will want to
          be slower than rate airspeed when maneuvering high to low in the lead turn and faster
          than rate in the opposite situation.
AETCTTP11-1        4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                              63



Figure 4.26. Energy Atom.




          4.8.1.5 Use of the Vertical. Hypothetically, to execute a pure vertical lead turn from
          high to low, you would want approximately 300 knots. If you have more than this, it
          will be difficult for you to control your airspeed. As airspeed builds, so does the over-
          G potential. Additionally, the turn radius at high speeds may make the floor more of a
          threat than the Bandit. Conversely, if you are converting from low to high, purely in
          the vertical, you want closer to 500 knots. Starting at this airspeed, using target G, the
          fighter will easily be slowing through 400 knots in less than 90° of turn. The more co-
          altitude you are, the closer to 400 knots you should strive to be.
    4.8.2 HABFM Setups. Butterfly setups will be executed IAW the squadron standards
    and/or IFF Playbook. The goal of “canned” high-aspect setups, especially early in IFF, is to
    introduce HABFM execution in a more predictable engagement. On subsequent missions,
    the student will be given the opportunity to evaluate the tactical situation and make a
    decision prior to the check away regarding planned merge geometry. Flying the proper
    setup mechanics will allow the fighter to arrive at the merge in a position of advantage. The
    Bandit will not allow the fighter an ideal lead turn to a stern conversion. Instead, he will
    allow the student some amount of TR depending on mission and engagement
    circumstances. Additionally, the Bandit will not typically maneuver until the fighter has
    reached his 3/9 line. Refer to Figure 4.27. The fighter should strive to cross through the
    Bandit’s CZ (Fighter 2) with airspeed between instantaneous corner and sustained-rate
    velocity (380-420 knots). If the fighter crosses inside the Bandit’s turn radius (Fighter 1), he
    will allow the Bandit the opportunity for a reversal and give up the advantage gained in the
    lead turn. If the fighter merges too far behind the Bandit (Fighter 3), range will build and
64                                                      AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009

     increase the time and fuel required to kill the Bandit. Additionally, this could allow the
     Bandit to capitalize on a separation opportunity.

Figure 4.27. Merge Objective.




           4.8.2.1 Prior to the Check Away. Determine if you will use vertical TR above or
           below the Bandit. There are several factors that will affect your HABFM game plan
           selection of whether to use a high-to-low or low-to-high conversion. However, the
           most important and therefore overriding factor is ease of tally for the fighter and
           attempting to deny the Bandit the tally. Use the environment to your advantage.
           Placing the Bandit between you and a cloud layer will vastly improve your ability to
           keep the tally. Likewise, placing yourself between the Bandit and the sun will make
           his job much harder.
           4.8.2.2 Check Away. Select military power and begin a 30° turn away from the
           Bandit. While modulating power as required and maintaining awareness of the
           Bandit, begin to build vertical TR with a climb or descent and apply a cross-check
           that favors more attention to the Bandit the further away the two aircraft get. Monitor
           airspeed in the climb or descent to achieve briefed game plan. If approaching the
           limits of visual acuity prior to the “FIGHT’S ON ” begin to turn as directed or briefed
           to maintain the visual and call ‟padlocked.”
           4.8.2.3 At the "TURN IN, FIGHT’S ON." The best way to achieve the merge
           objective is to build in a combination of vertical and lateral TR prior to the lead turn.
           This combination of vertical and lateral TR will then be used in the lead turn to
           decrease HCA and fly to the merge objective. This will require a max performance
           energy depleting turn. The objective is to turn inside the Bandit’s TC to point at his
           CZ (Figure 4.28). If the fighter floats to the outside, there won’t be enough time or
           range to gain TR prior to the merge. During the turn, AGSM is a priority to maintain
           the tally. You will be looking at a T-38 rotating towards pure pursuit more than 2 NM
           away. If you are not padlocked on the Bandit, you will lose the tally. DO NOT LOOK
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                           65

          IN THE COCKPIT DURING THE TURN IN. The fighter’s second priority is a max
          performance turn that gains lateral TR and doesn’t use up too much of the vertical TR
          already gained.

Figure 4.28. Get to the Inside at the Turn In.




          4.8.2.4. High-to-Low Turn In Mechanics. Start the AGSM, set throttles to MAX
          afterburner, stare at the Bandit while overrotating the LV, and begin a max allowable
          G pull. As the nose drops towards the horizon, reset the LV closer to the horizon to
          preserve vertical TR. Continue the turn, pulling the Bandit across your nose for
          approximately 2 seconds (Figure 4.29). You may momentarily lose sight of the
          Bandit as he passes under your nose. Regardless, continue to pull the Bandit across
          your nose and aim your gun cross towards the Bandit’s CZ. Consider rolling past
          wings level into the Bandit to aid in tally maintenance and Bandit assessment. Your
          goal now is to manage energy and assess LOSR cues for initiating the lead turn. Even
          after a well-executed turn in, you won’t have longer than 1 to 2 seconds prior to
          executing the lead turn. Power placement will depend on current airspeed and vertical
          displacement relative to the Bandit. However, as a default, leaving the power in MAX
          afterburner is usually warranted. Reference the energy atom discussion (paragraph
          4.8.1.4) for desired airspeed based on the ratio of lateral to vertical TR available.
          Generally, 350 to 400 knots is a good target airspeed for the lead turn. You will have
          little more than just enough time for one quick BFM cross-check in the HUD prior to
          starting the lead turn.

Figure 4.29. High-to-Low Turn In.




          4.8.2.5 Low-to-High Turn In Mechanics. Start the AGSM, select power as required,
          and set the LV to bring the nose up to the Bandit’s low CZ. For the turn in, blend the
          G into the SRB or moderate buffet, whichever occurs first. As a default, select MAX
          afterburner during the pull. However, if you encounter the SRB with little to no
          buffet, sustain the SRB and delay increasing power. Similar to the turn in for a high-
          to-low conversion, you will pull the Bandit across the nose aiming to put the gun
          cross in the Bandit’s low CZ. This time the Bandit will be above you and tally
          maintenance will be easier. Given a max performance turn in, you’ll need to gain
          airspeed. Leave the throttles in MAX as a default and if circumstances allow, glance
          at your parameters (with the Bandit against a blue sky background, you won’t be able
          to). Depending on how quickly you approach your game plan airspeed you may need
          to reduce power. Attempt to have 420 to 450 knots for a typical low-to-high
          conversion. Use caution for the floor. Depending on altitude at the check away and
          your descent rate prior to the turn in, you may have to adjust you LV before or during
          the turn in to stay above the floor.
     4.8.3 Lead Turn. Lead turn keys to success are: continuous Bandit assessment, LV
     placement, and turn performance.
          4.8.3.1 Lead Turn Cues. A rapidly increasing LOSR aft is the cue to start the lead
          turn. For a right-to-right pass, the Bandit will swing from approximately 1 to 2
          o’clock (Figure 4.30). The most common error is a late lead turn. If in doubt, start the
          lead turn early; however, do not to turn in front of the Bandit.
          4.8.3.2 Lead Turn Assessment. If you start your lead turn late, there is nothing you
          can immediately do; you have built in a BFM problem you will have to solve later. If
          you start your lead turn early, the LOSR will slow down or freeze on the canopy. In
          this case, you must ease off the G momentarily to let the LOSR increase again
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               67

          4.8.3.3 Bandit Turn Direction. During the lead turn, you must also evaluate the
          Bandit’s game plan in order to develop your own. The Bandit will be the last to turn
          and therefore will determine whether you initially enter a one or two-circle fight. If,
          as you cross the Bandit’s 3/9, he turns into you, he has established a two-circle fight.
          On the other hand, if he turns away from you, you will be in a one-circle fight. Early
          recognition of the fight the Bandit has set will be critical to achieve the quickest kill.
          Figure 4.31 illustrates the cues to identify a two-circle and one-circle fight
          respectively.

     4.8.4 HABFM Post-Merge:
          4.8.4.1 Two-Circle Fight:
          4.8.4.1.1 Game Plan. The game plan in HABFM is to gain TR, execute an effective
          lead turn, transition to a sustained-rate fight, align TCs, and kill.
          4.8.4.1.2 Merge Assessment. A two-circle fight, (when both fighters turn toward
          each other at the merge and continue) is primarily a rate fight where the fighter with
          the better rate over time gains an offensive advantage. At the completion of your lead
          turn, readjust LV slightly below the Bandit and sustain the best rate airspeed the
          Bandit will allow. Immediately assess your position in relation to the Bandit. A good
          check point for this assessment is the 180° point in the turn. This point is when the
          two aircraft are the furthest apart and may present WEZ opportunities.
          4.8.4.1.3 Transition to the Rate Fight. Post-merge mechanics will vary depending
          on the Bandit maneuvering. Regardless of merge geometry, maneuver to gain the
          sustained-rate airspeed between 380 to 420 knots.
          4.8.4.1.3.1 High-to-Low Conversion. Continue the max performance pull of the lead
          turn and adjust LV and power to achieve sustained-rate airspeed between 380 and
          420. If accelerating to or through your target sustained-rate airspeed, reduce power
          and/or the LV to get closer to the G warmup picture then return to MAX. If the lead
          turn LV was closer to the horizon, the required LV change will probably be small and
          power may be left in afterburner (AB).
          4.8.4.1.3.2 Low-to-High Conversion. As you cross through the Bandit’s CZ and he
          turns into you, your airspeed will be decreasing and your nose may be above the
          horizon. The longer this continues to happen, the more difficult it will be to transition
          to the rate game plan. Timely assessment of the Bandit’s turn into the fighter and
          subsequent rapid repo of the LV lower are critical to success. The instant you
          perceive a two-circle fight developing, quickly move your LV to below the horizon
          and ensure the throttles are in MAX. How far below the horizon the LV is placed will
          depend on airspeed and the position of the Bandit. The further above the horizon the
          nose is and the slower the fighter is, the further below the horizon the LV should be
          (up to 60 initially). As the nose transitions through the horizon, update the LV.
          However, you will need to use the vertical to recover airspeed while maintaining G.
          As the fight matures, capitalize on TC extensions to increase airspeed if required.
          4.8.4.1.4 Energy Management. Given the limitation of the T-38 and rear aspect
          ordnance, the fighter must first realign TCs striving for the CZ to achieve a WEZ and
          subsequent kill. The fighter should have an angular and a power advantage
          throughout the fight. The use of TC extensions will help realign TCs. The average
          two-circle fight will require more than one extension. This will take time compared to
          offensive perch setups. Patience and a solid BFM cross-check to manage the LV for
          sustained energy are critical. Additionally, the fighter will hold a significant amount
          of Gs for an extended period of time, so an effective AGSM will be required to
          maintain the tally and correctly assess the Bandit.
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                              69

          4.8.4.1.5 Turn Circle Extensions (TCX). Achieving a nose position advantage and
          extending to the Bandit’s TC becomes the fighter’s next priority. TCX’s will be
          required to bring the TCs closer together and allow the fighter to establish themselves
          in the CZ. Some axioms of TCXs include:
              Can only be used if the fighter is winning.
              Must happen at the correct time.
              Should be held long enough to pull the TCs towards each other, but not so long
               that range and HCA build excessively.

          4.8.4.1.5.1 Winning Cues. LOSR towards the canopy bow, with aspect angle usually
          <90 is one cue. If AA is building significantly past 90° (the Bandit’s nose is rotating
          towards you) with LOSR towards the canopy bow, execute another lead turn. The
          fighter should continue the turn, prioritizing rate parameters to gain a rate advantage.
          Given typical merge geometry and Bandit cuffs, most of the time the fighter will
          quickly see winning cues.
          4.8.4.1.5.2 When to Execute the TCX (Figures 4.32 and 4.33). The goal is to
          extend just inside the apex of the Bandit’s TC. (This is the quickest way to move the
          fighter's TC closer to the Bandit’s. Extend too late (dotted line) and you will cut too
          far inside the Bandits TC; if too early, then range will build significantly (dashed
          lines). With forward LOSR towards the canopy bow, the Bandit will appear to rotate
          (increasing aspect) as the fighter starts to point towards or slightly inside the apex of
          the Bandit’s TC. A simple rule of thumb of extension direction is to pull the Bandit to
          the assessment window, assess AA and LOSR and then extend or continue to the
          second merge.

Figure 4.32. When to Extend Part 1.                Figure 4.33. When to Extend Part 2.
70                                                AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009

     4.8.4.1.5.3 TCX Mechanics. Pull the Bandit to the assessment window, ease off the
     G, and freeze the picture. Once LOSR aft develops, reapply G to the sustained turn
     rate. The ease normally lasts 2 to 3 seconds. Airspeed awareness prior to reapplying
     the G is essential. If sustaining your target airspeed and G, you will need to reduce
     power or climb during the extension to prevent getting fast. On the other hand, if
     slower than desired, leave the power in MAX and deliberately unload to accelerate
     during the extension. If you don’t extend for long enough and G is applied too soon,
     you will see immediate LOSR towards the canopy bow; ease off again and let LOSR
     aft develop before “getting back on the pull.” Remember, the merge objective and
     requirement to assess Bandit turn direction applies to every merge. At subsequent
     merges, if you erroneously cross too close behind the Bandit, he may reverse and
     transition to a one-circle fight.
     4.8.4.1.6 Transition to OBFM. Eventually, you will see range and aspect pictures
     that look similar to canopy bow assessment from the OBFM phase. The amount of
     TR allowed, lead turn effectiveness, and energy management all factor into how long
     it will take (and how many TCXs) before the transition to recognizable OBFM
     “pictures” will happen. Depending on the above factors, the time required can vary
     from 500 of fighting to over 1,000! It is likely you will be near the floor before
     transitioning to OBFM. Remember that Ps=0 mechanics at the floor won’t allow the
     same G as during the descending portion of the fight. To continue with a sustained-
     rate game plan you will have to let G taper off slightly at the floor; you will feel less
     buffet as you are further away from the lift limit line (Reference Figure BFM 8). Be
     patient, and be deliberate with your BFM cross-check and Bandit assessment.
     4.8.4.2 One-Circle Fight:
     4.8.4.2.1 Game Plan. Once identified as a one-circle fight, the game plan is to
     transition to a min radius fight and lead turn the Bandit to align fuselages and kill.
     4.8.4.2.2 Merge Assessment. A one-circle fight results when the fighters turn in
     opposite directions at the merge, but both aircraft’s ground track is in the same
     direction.
     4.8.4.2.3 Transitioning to the Min Radius Fight. Post-merge mechanics will vary
     depending on if the fighter is merging from below or above the Bandit. Regardless of
     merge geometry, pull to the moderate buffet (or SRB, whichever occurs first).
     4.8.4.2.3.1 Low to High. Given you have the desired airspeed relative to merge
     geometry, leave the power in MAX and pull with POM on the Bandit. As you slow
     down, SRB will BE replaced by buffet (assuming constant pull); the aircraft is
     transitioning from the G limit to the lift limit. Approaching 350 knots, radius will
     decrease as the aircraft slows. From 350 knots to approximately 250 knots the turn
     radius remains about the same. Below 250 knots, however, the turn radius opens back
     up again.
     4.8.4.2.3.2 High to Low. If airspeed is high, immediately select IDLE power. As
     your nose will be below the horizon, quickly reset the LV to get POM on to slightly
     above the Bandit (use caution if you are in the SRB). As the nose tracks to or above
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             71

          the horizon you should be slowing towards instantaneous corner; put the power back
          in MAX and continue a moderate buffet pull.
          4.8.4.2.4 Bandit Assessment Across the Circle (Figure 4.34). As you and the
          Bandit are approximately coheading across the circle from each other, start to assess
          whether you are winning, neutral, or losing the min radius fight (Figure 4.34). At the
          second merge, expect the fight to transition to a scissors, a two-circle (energy fight),
          or continue in a min radius fight.

Figure 4.34. One-Circle Assessment.




          4.8.4.2.4.1 Winning Cues. With AA stagnant or decreasing, you see LOSR forward
          begin to develop. With winning cues, execute a lead turn to minimize HCA. Use
          LOSR towards and then across your nose as the cue to execute the lead turn. At this
          second merge, you must assess Bandit turn direction just like you did at the initial
          merge (dashed rectangle in Figure 4.35).
          4.8.4.2.4.1.1 Scissors. If the Bandit reverses his turn (the solid red arrow in Figure
          4.35), you will transition to a scissors. Your game plan is to lead turn to align
          fuselages and slow down as required to gain weapons separation.

Figure 4.35. One-Circle – Winning.




          4.8.4.2.4.1.2 Two-Circle Fight. If the Bandit continues his turn (with his LV and
          nose dropping below the horizon), he is transitioning to an energy fight (dotted red
          line in). Use power as required and quickly reset the LV to below the horizon to get
          on the briefed rate fight game plan.

Figure 4.36. Use the Turning Room.
AETCTTP11-1        4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               73

           4.8.4.2.4.2 Neutral Cues. LOSR is forward, but Bandit aspect steadily increases
           towards pure as he approaches the nose. The LV may have to be changed as range
           decreases to ensure vertical deconfliction in a truly neutral second merge. With
           neutral cues, you will end up in a second merge where neither the fighter nor Bandit
           possesses a significant advantage. The engagement could continue one circle or
           transition into a two-circle fight. The last fighter to turn determines the fight. Do not
           be indecisive.
           4.8.4.2.4.2.1 Approaching the Next Merge. If there is ANY lateral TR between you
           and the Bandit, use it; don’t let the Bandit lead turn you! In Figure 4.36, if the fighter
           continues the turn (solid blue line) the TR between him and the Bandit (green hashes)
           becomes exclusive TR for the Bandit. Instead, the fighter should use the TR (dotted
           blue line). As you do so, assess Bandit turn direction and continue the min radius
           fight or transition to the two-circle fight.
           4.8.4.2.4.2.2 Neutral Pass. In a completely neutral pass with no lateral TR, the last
           fighter to turn sets the fight. Again, don’t be indecisive; however, take your energy
           state and nose position into consideration. At 350 knots or less, consider forcing a
           one-circle, min radius fight. If >350 knots or with the nose >~15 below the horizon,
           consider forcing a two-circle fight.
           4.8.4.2.4.3 Losing Cues. LOSR is stagnant or aft with the Bandit’s nose rotating
           towards pure. Typical BFM errors that cause this situation are a light G pull at the
           initial merge and poor LV control transitioning from a high-to-low conversion to the
           one-circle, min radius fight. If you find yourself assessing losing cues, make sure you
           are in a moderate buffet, pull close to the lift limit line, and transition to DBFM if
           necessary. While executing the appropriate defense mechanics, continue to assess the
           Bandit for opportunities to reverse, neutralize, or separate. NEVER GIVE UP!!!
4.9 Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM). ACM is a substantial leap from BFM in terms of
employment. No longer is it a single-man concept where your only cross-check is the Bandit.
You now have to bring your element mate into your cross-check along with the normal Bandit
assessment. ACM is the first mission where you employ as a team and attempt to maximize
visual mutual support. Task prioritization now becomes an issue because the fighters are
attempting to either kill or survive while maintaining element deconfliction. While it is the
responsibility of each pilot to clear his own flightpath with all sensors available, the wingman
carries the primary responsibility of element deconfliction. There are situations, however, when
the wingman is not capable of adhering to his primary responsibility, and that responsibility
needs to be transferred to the flight lead until the wingman is in a position to reassume his
primary role. If deconfliction responsibility is disregarded or not shared appropriately, there can
be disastrous consequences.
     4.9.1 ACM Roles:
           4.9.1.1 Engaged Fighter Versus Support Fighter. The term “engaged” is used to
           establish the engaged fighter role in an ACM engagement. Once established, the other
           fighter by default is the "support" fighter.
           4.9.1.2 Establishing the Roles. Establishing the engaged and support roles is
           important in the visual arena because both fighters are maneuvering in relation to
74                                                  AETCTTP11-1          4 SEPTEMBER 2009

     the Bandit to defensively survive and offensively achieve a quick kill, while
     deconflicting within the element. The establishment of engaged and support roles can
     aid in ensuring element deconfliction by shifting the responsibility for deconfliction
     to the fighter in the best position to deconflict. Initially, before roles are established, it
     is the wingman's responsibility to deconflict with the flight lead. While both fighters
     are responsible for clearing their own flightpath, the support fighter has the ultimate
     responsibility for element deconfliction, allowing the engaged fighter to have the
     right of way. The bottom line is one Bandit equals one engaged fighter.
     4.9.1.3 Engaged Fighter Role and Responsibilities. The engaged fighter executes
     his best BFM to survive and kill the Bandit, regardless of status
     (defensive/offensive/neutral). In addition, the engaged fighter should strive to
     maintain tally and visual, if able.
     4.9.1.4 Support Fighter Roles and Responsibilities. The support fighter’s primary
     responsibility is to deconflict from the engaged fighter. In order to provide element
     deconfliction, the support fighter must stay visual throughout the fight, even at the
     expense of good BFM against the Bandit. The support fighter’s secondary
     responsibility is to take shots of opportunity with a clear field of fire. The support
     fighter’s tertiary responsibility is to clear the fight for other adversaries that are a
     factor to the element and to maintain overall element SA to include area orientation,
     fuel, and separation opportunities.
     4.9.1.5 Establishing Roles. The key to positive role establishment is clear, concise,
     correct, and timely comm. Roles are established by an “ENGAGED” call from one
     fighter and a “PRESS” call acknowledgement by the other. The roles are not
     established without the “PRESS” call. It’s important to note that the “ENGAGED”
     call is a request from number 2, and until the flight lead responds with a “PRESS”
     call, number 2’s primary responsibility as the support fighter is to continue to
     deconflict. The hierarchy to determine who should be calling “ENGAGED” is as
     follows:
          Most defensive fighter.
          Most offensive fighter.
          Flight lead.

     4.9.1.5.1 Most Defensive. The fighter upon whom the Bandit has focused the
     offensive attack should call “ENGAGED,” or a defensive fighter whose immediate
     priority is focused on survival instead of deconfliction should call “ENGAGED.”
     4.9.1.5.2 Most Offensive. With the element being offensive, the most offensive
     fighter should call “ENGAGED.” The most offensive is:
          The only fighter with a tallyho. If both fighters have a tallyho; then…
          The fighter with the most offensive entry (will have offensive angles). If not
           clear, whoever has the most offensive entry; then…
          The first to merge with the Bandit.
AETCTTP11-1    4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               75

       4.9.1.5.3 Flight Lead. If a maneuvering fight is developing, and no roles have been
       established, the flight lead should declare “ENGAGED.” If there is any confusion, the
       wingman continues to deconflict until roles are confirmed.
       4.9.1.5.4 Directing the Wingman to Engage. The flight lead can direct the wingman
       to call “ENGAGED” with a “PRESS” call. In this example, the wingman should be
       engaged but has not called it. The flight lead calls, “EAGLE TWO, PRESS.” The
       wingman responds with, “EAGLE TWO'S, ENGAGED.” The role swap has now
       officially occurred and Eagle 2 is the engaged fighter with Eagle 1 providing
       deconfliction as the support fighter.
       4.9.1.6 Engaged and Support Role Changes. Once roles have been established, the
       element should strive not to change the engaged/support roles unless absolutely
       necessary (unnecessary communications and possible confusion). The driving factor
       to force a role swap is the support fighter's inability to “survive/kill” while continuing
       to deconflict. The following are examples of when the role exchange would be
       required.
       4.9.1.6.1 Engaged Fighter Is Offensive/Neutral. The support fighter does not
       require permission to employ ordnance as long as flightpath and weapons
       deconfliction can be maintained. Shots should always be communicated. If the
       support fighter cannot employ ordnance and deconflict, call “ENGAGED.”
       Consideration should be given to not calling the engaged fighter out of an offensive
       position for a fleeting missile WEZ. If the engaged fighter is neutral or stagnated in
       an offensive position and the support fighter has a better entry into the CZ and gun
       WEZ, the support fighter should call “ENGAGED” to initiate and request the role
       exchange. The support fighter will maintain deconfliction until the role swap has
       occurred through a “PRESS” call. (See paragraph 4.9.3 for detailed discussion on
       ACM communication.. The support fighter should call “ENGAGED” prior to
       maneuvering the aircraft into a position where there is a potential flightpath conflict.
       4.9.1.6.2 Support Fighter Becomes Defensive. The Bandit could elect to switch
       fighters at any time. The roles should swap when the support fighter becomes
       defensive and can no longer defend and deconflict. This will require communications
       for the swap to be complete. Until the role swap has occurred, however, the support
       fighter’s primary job is maintaining element deconfliction, even when defensive.
       4.9.1.6.3 Weapons Employment and Deconfliction (Figure 4.37). After the support
       fighter has maneuvered his aircraft to a position where he can maintain deconfliction,
       he should start looking for shots of opportunity with a clear field of fire (CFOF).
       Different A/A weapons have different weapon deconfliction requirements. For the T-
       38C AIM-9 (to include the P+) to meet weapons deconfliction, the other blue fighter
       can’t be within a 10° FOV at pickle for the entire time of flight (TOF) of the missile.
       A 10° FOV can be simulated by an area inside the airspeed, altitude, and heading bars
       on the HUD. If the other blue fighter is or will be in that region at pickle through
       missile impact, CFOF has not been satisfied and the shot should not be taken. Missile
       TOF can be simulated by the following rule of thumb (ROT): 6 seconds per NM with
       a tail aspect, 4 seconds per NM in the beam, and 2 seconds per NM with an H aspect.
       If the engaged fighter calls “DEFENSIVE” at any point in time, or if the support
76                                                      AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009

          fighter determines the engaged fighter is defensive, weapons deconfliction may be
          relaxed but not entirely discarded. The track of the missile is still the responsibility of
          the shooter, but a much smaller CFOF may be acceptable if the engaged fighter is in
          danger of being killed in a short period of time. Example: If a fighter is defensive at
          ground level, out of energy and ideas, with a Bandit stuck at 6 o'clock and 1,000 feet,
          the situation is a bit more pressing.

     4.9.2 ACM Communications:
          4.9.2.1 Standard Communication. Pilots must use standard terminology in order to
          avoid confusion, enhance SA, and minimize excessive radio transmission time.
          Nonstandard radio terminology, lack of call signs, and excessive communication can
          cause confusion and misunderstanding at a critical time. Use a separate radio to the
          maximum extent possible for ACM communication.
          4.9.2.2 Categories. There are four categories of communication words that apply to
          ACM: engaged/support, directive, descriptive, and informative. This discussion is
          presented in terms of an engaged element.
          4.9.2.2.1 Engaged/Support Communication:
          4.9.2.2.1.1 “ENGAGED.” The fight member is informing the element of the intent to
          take the engaged fighter role. From the wingman, it is a request for the engaged
          fighter role. In either case, a response is required. If it will enhance SA, include a
          descriptive term: “EAGLE ONE ENGAGED, DEFENSIVE.”
          4.9.2.2.1.2 “PRESS.” A response to an “ENGAGED” call that confirms the flight
          member who called “ENGAGED” is the engaged fighter. The member who called
          “PRESS” is the support fighter. This is the only acceptable response from a wingman
          when the flight lead calls “ENGAGED” unless the wingman is blind or will go
          defensive and die. Roles are established or swapped.
AETCTTP11-1     4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                           77

       4.9.2.2.1.3 “UNABLE.” A response to an “ENGAGED” call indicating the engaged
       fighter is unable to disengage or pick up the support role without going defensive or
       dying. This communication usually includes a descriptive term stating the reason.
       “EAGLE TWO, UNABLE, DEFENSIVE/BLIND.” Roles are not swapped.
       4.9.2.2.1.4 “NEGATIVE.” A flight lead’s only response which simply means “NO.”
       The flight lead, based on inherent authority, is unwilling to allow the wingman to
       become the engaged fighter. Roles are not swapped
       4.9.2.2.2 Directive Communication. Directive communication tells the other fighter
       in the element to do something. Used to maneuver the element in the most
       advantageous manner to survive or engage the threat. When using directive
       communication, preface the call with the call sign of the flight member to act. For
       example, a wingman who visually detects a Bandit approaching weapons parameters
       from the flight lead's right side would say, “EAGLE ONE, BREAK RIGHT.”
       Examples of directive terms are:
           Break (with direction): a maximum performance, energy depleting turn with
            flares.
           Hard (with direction): a maximum power sustained performance turn.
           Flare.
           Separate (with direction).
           Jink.
           Reference (with direction).

       4.9.2.2.3 Descriptive Communication. Descriptive communication informs the other
       fighters where to look or what they may see. After initiating a reaction with directive
       communication, fill in with descriptive commentary, as required to coordinate
       between involved fighters. Descriptive commentary is normally prefaced with the call
       sign of the flight member being addressed. For example, Eagle 2 says: “EAGLE
       ONE, BANDIT RIGHT 3 O'CLOCK 2 MILES, LOW.” The following are additional
       descriptive items as the situation requires:
             Type aircraft or threat identification
             Left or right (side of aircraft)
             Clock position
             Range
             High/level/low
             Amplifying remarks
       4.9.2.2.4 Informative SA Building Communication. Additional examples of
       descriptive communication that informs the other flight members of intentions
       include “EAGLE TWO...
78                                                     AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009


                 OFFENSIVE/DEFENSIVE”
                 ANCHORED”
                 IN/OUT”
                 Bandit SWITCH”
                 SPLIT”
                 FOX 2”
           4.9.2.2.5 Plain English. While communication discipline is of extremely high
           importance in the air combat arena, killing the Bandit in minimum time while
           ensuring blue force deconfliction is paramount. If undecided what to say, revert to
           plain English to convey intentions to the other fighter.
     4.9.3 ACM Execution Based on Attack/Detection Quadrant. The following sections
     address element ACM execution when committed to a merge. The requirement to enter the
     ACM environment could occur at the end of an intercept or in the post-merge arena.
     Execution mechanics will address response based on threat detection from visual detection,
     traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), or AWACS/GCI. The principles of ACM are:
         Detect the threat.
         Engage:
          - Direct an initial move to defeat any initial attack.
          - Maintain element mutual support by establishing roles.
          - Best BFM to kill and survive.
         Separate with visual mutual support.

           4.9.3.1 Threat Detection. In order to prosecute and defeat a short-range attack, the
           threat must first be detected. Detecting threats is a continuous effort. Element
           members must clear the area around their flight for new threats and multiquadrant
           attacks. The complete attention of both element members cannot be focused on a
           single threat attacking them. The support fighter, in particular, must be alert for
           additional threats. Detection can occur from a GCI point out, TCAS, or visually. To
           successfully prosecute and defeat a short-range attack, visual acquisition by at least
           one element member early in the initial move sequence is essential.
           4.9.3.2 Target Detection. Once the decision to engage has been made, the element
           needs to effectively communicate, sanitize for other threats, and arrive in the visual
           arena with an offensive advantage. As a minimum, be in a position to get the tallyho
           and have immediate weapons opportunity at the merge. If the pilot with the initial
           detection is expecting to merge with a Bandit, the other fighter needs to quickly know
           where to visually search as well as where to position the aircraft.
           4.9.3.3 Initial Communications at Visual Pickup. The fighter who initially detects
           the threat needs to base their initial radio transmission on the Bandit's proximity to a
           WEZ. Communicate with the appropriate AFTTP 3-1.1 brevity terms to state the
           Bandit's location. If the Bandit appears unaware, depending on the mission, the initial
           call may just be descriptive to point out the threat: “EAGLE TWO, TALLY ONE,
           BRA 260, 2, COLD.” If the intent is to get the flight turning toward a Bandit who is
           not in a WEZ (due to range or nose position) then a hard turn should be called by the
           flight lead: “EAGLE HARD RIGHT.” If the Bandit is in or approaching a WEZ the
AETCTTP11-1    4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                              79

       first radio transmission needs to be geared toward ensuring the survival of the flight:
       “EAGLE ONE, BREAK RIGHT.” The first priority is directive calls to ensure flight
       survival, followed by descriptive calls to allow the other flight member to get a
       tallyho. As a general ROT, all visual pickups with an aspect >90° should be assumed
       to be approaching a WEZ and consideration should be given to “Break” turns versus
       “Hard” turns to engage.
       4.9.3.4 Formation. The element should attempt a bracket with both vertical and
       lateral offset in order to maximize split-plane maneuvering to deny the Bandit “Tally
       2.” The objective is to intercept the Bandit from two distinct sides, force the Bandit to
       turn, providing one fighter a shot/kill opportunity. Both fighters should maneuver for
       TR. If the Bandit maneuvers to flank or beam the element, it may be impossible to
       execute a bracket attack and should transition to a single-side offset (SSO) intercept
       with vertical offset. If intercepting from a SSO, the non-tally fighter should take
       spacing and establish a 1- to 1.5-nm lateral and 2000-3,000 feet of vertical separation.
       Vertical spacing should be in relation to the Bandit. This ensures TR and weapons
       separation at the merge while preventing the Bandit from visually acquiring both
       fighters. The element should be in a position that if the Bandit survives to the merge,
       the ACM roles can then be defined, and visual maneuvering will result in a quick kill
       of the Bandit.
       4.9.3.5 Visual Pickup in the Front Quarter:
       4.9.3.5.1 High-Aspect Bracket Game Plan. The element should attempt a bracket
       with both vertical and lateral offset in order to maximize split-plane maneuvering to
       deny the Bandit “Tally 2.” The objective is to intercept the Bandit from two distinct
       sides, denying the ability to defend against both fighters, and giving one fighter a shot
       opportunity. See Figure 4.38 for an example of the merge flow. Both fighters should
       maneuver for TR if able and force the Bandit to pass between the element. The
       engaged fighter, (the flight lead or whoever the Bandit is leaning on) should execute
       the merge prep checklist and strive to arrive at the merge in an offensive position. The
       support fighter should float his formation out to visual limits with a vertical stack off
       the horizon to deny the Bandit “Tally 2” (the desired formation is a 1- to 1.5-nm
       lateral and 2,000- to 3,000-foot vertical separation) in order to achieve TR and
       weapons separation. The support fighter should then turn towards the fight and
       prepare to take a quick shot with weapons deconfliction once the identification (ID) is
       made. A common description of this event is "filming the merge" because of the
       opportunity that exists for the wingman to have the Bandit in the HUD at the time of
       ID (due to the geometry of the intercept) (Figure 4.39). In this case, the fighter
       without the tally (default to the wingman) should pick up a formation position that
       will allow shot at the merge.
80                                                    AETCTTP11-1        4 SEPTEMBER 2009

          4.9.3.5.2 Establishing Engaged and Support Roles. Just prior to the merge (turning
          is about to begin), the element should establish the engaged and support roles. Since
          neither fighter is defensive, the most offensive fighter should call “ENGAGED.” This
          would be the only fighter with the tallyho. If both have tallyho, then the fighter with
          the most “offensive entry,” will call “ENGAGED,” If neither fighter clearly has an
          offensive advantage (significant lead turn), then maintain the element deconfliction
          contract and assess Bandit actions. The Bandit’s choice on whom to turn with should
AETCTTP11-1    4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                              81

       determine the resulting engaged/support roles. If the wingman is unsure, then lean
       forward with an “ENGAGED” call, and the flight lead can easily veto with
       “NEGATIVE, EAGLE ONE ENGAGED.”
       4.9.3.5.3 Merge. When merging with a Bandit, the appropriate fighter should always
       make a “MERGED” call if the flight has visual mutual support (VMS). This should
       help to get the other fighter's eyes on the Bandit and ensure both fighters see the same
       Bandit.
       4.9.3.5.4 Visual Identification (VID). If a VID is being accomplished and all ROE
       have been met, make the call in the following format: “EAGLE ONE, VID (ID ROE),
       (TYPE AIRCRAFT as required)”. The merge and VID call may be combined to
       reduce excessive comm. Example: “EAGLE 1 MERGED, VID, HOSTILE (VIPER).”
       4.9.3.5.5 Quick Kill or No Turn at Merge. With effective communications,
       formation, intercept, and ID, the fight should be over at the merge with a quick
       missile kill. The support fighter should have weapons separation prior to the merge
       and be in a position to shoot once the ROE and weapons deconfliction criteria have
       been met. If this is not accomplished and/or the flight lead does not want the element
       to turn at the merge, this should be communicated as soon as possible with a radio
       call.
       4.9.3.5.6 Engaged Fighter Turning at the Merge. The engaged fighter should turn
       to execute the best BFM to kill the Bandit. This will also make the Bandit somewhat
       predictable. Typically, single-circle fights put more pressure on an adversary than
       two-circle fights. Single-circle fights force the Bandit to get anchored and low on
       energy, allowing for an unobserved rear-hemisphere WEZ entry by the support
       fighter.
       4.9.3.5.7. Status Calls. If unsure of which aircraft is which, the support fighter should
       query with a radio call: “EAGLE ONE, STATUS HIGH/LOW.” “HIGH/LOW” can
       be substituted with whatever the support fighter sees or makes sense from his angle.
       Other acceptable description fill-ins may be “NOSE HIGH/LOW, RIGHT/LEFT
       SIDE, LEFT/RIGHT TURN”. Cardinal directions and headings should be avoided
       because it requires head’s down time by both fighters. Eagle 1 at this point should be
       as descriptive as possible and always tell the status in response to what he was asked,
       and then any other SA enhancing parameters of Eagle 1’s aircraft. As an example,
       “EAGLE ONE IS HIGH MAN, OFFENSIVE.”
       4.9.3.5.8 Kill Calls. The shooter should use the ROT as mentioned earlier for missile
       TOF before making a kill call. Kill calls should be as descriptive as possible.
       Example: “EAGLE TWO, KILL BANDIT, RIGHT HAND TURN, 14K FEET,
       NOSE LOW.” The shooter should ensure the Bandit acknowledges the kill,
       “BANDIT, COPY KILL,” while directing the separation.
       4.9.3.5.9 Separations. Once a kill is achieved, execute a separation. The support
       fighter is primarily responsible for directing the separation since his tertiary
       responsibility is to gain SA on the battlefield. The support fighter needs to assess the
       energy states of both fighters in order to give a separate heading that will put them
       close to LAB. As a general ROT, the separation direction should be limited to less
82                                                AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009

     than 90° from the current flow. This will ensure that both fighters will be banked up
     for a limited amount of time, thereby decreasing the possibility of another Bandit
     picking up the tally. It also allows the fighters to get to a VMS formation quickly so
     that the coordinated sensor ops game plan can be reestablished in a timely fashion.
     Power should be MAX, and the jet should be unloaded to 0.5G. This gets the
     formation back to an acceptable energy state and gets the formation low to decrease
     possible WEZ’s from other Bandits.
     4.9.3.6 Visual Pickup in the Beam:
     4.9.3.6.1 Shooter-Eye Game Plan. The element should position itself to engage as
     described in visual pickup in the front quarter. As stated earlier, if it was a visual
     pickup, assume the Bandit is approaching a WEZ. The fighter who picked up the
     Tally should direct the formation towards the Bandit with a “Break” turn. If a “tally”
     from the defensive fighter is not immediately forthcoming, whichever fighter called
     the break should follow quickly with directive and descriptive communication to
     prevent the other fighter from breaking so far as to go belly up to the Bandit. If both
     fighters see the Bandit, the closest fighter to the Bandit should call “ENGAGED” and
     press an attack on the Bandit since he will be the first to merge. The initial break turn
     will likely drive the fighters into a trail formation from which the trail and outside
     fighter should have weapons separation and a shot opportunity if the Bandit engages
     the lead fighter.
     4.9.3.6.2 Merge. As stated above, the inside fighter is best suited to be the engaged
     fighter (first to merge). Lack of proper ID may force a merge before any T-38Cs can
     shoot. Whether or not the engaged fighter turns immediately at the merge depends on
     whether trailers are suspected. Regardless, the first to merge should call the VID.
     Turning at the merge will immediately put pressure on the Bandit and will facilitate a
     quick exit of the trailing fighter's field of fire (depending on what the Bandit does).
     This will present a quicker shot opportunity to the trailing fighter and allow offensive
     angles by the engaged fighter if the Bandit extends to merge with the support fighter.
     Regardless of which fighter merges and engages with the Bandit, they should still
     execute merge prep and be prepared to fight their best 1v1 BFM with the game plan
     of anchoring the Bandit single-circle if the merge geometry allows.
     4.9.3.6.3 Bandit Turns with the Lead Fighter. If the Bandit turns on the first fighter
     to enter the merge, the trailing fighter should have an easy shot opportunity and an
     offensive entry. The trailing fighter should ensure weapons deconfliction and shoot if
     in a WEZ. If required to enter a gun WEZ, the support fighter (the trailing aircraft)
     can subsequently initiate or request an exchange of roles by calling “ENGAGED.”
     See Figure 4.40 for an example of the fight flow.
     4.9.3.6.4 Bandit Extends to the Trail Fighter. The Bandit also has the option to
     blow through the first merge and switch to the trail fighter if “Tally 2.” The first to
     assess this should call out “Bandit Switch” with your call sign, and expect a role swap
     will logically ensue. This will allow the engaged fighter (first to merge) to rapidly
     gain an angular advantage on the Bandit. In either case the element should be able to
     achieve a quick kill. See Figure 4.41 for an example of the fight flow.
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               83

          4.9.3.7 Visual Pickup in the Stern. Despite tremendous advances in all-aspect
          weaponry, the stern quadrant is still the flight's most vulnerable cone. First, the
          fighter will have no shot opportunity until nearly 180° of turn—an expenditure of
          time and energy. Second, in a stern attack, the Bandit may continue firing ordnance
          until forced out of 6 o'clock. Unlike a beam or head-on attack, reduced closure will
          allow the Bandit to remain in firing parameters for a longer period of time. Both
          fighters can greatly increase their probability of post-merge survival by keeping their
          speed up, descending to lower altitudes (SA and threat permitting), and maintaining
          optimal tactical formation. If possible, an altitude stack (1,000 to 3,000 feet, unless on
          the deck) and wider tactical formation (9,000 feet, plus) should be flown. A Bandit
          converting on two coaltitude, 6,000-foot spaced T-38s is presented with a much easier
          tally two (or four) opportunity. This section will cover element maneuvering against a
          threat that is initially detected in the flight's stern quadrant.

Figure 4.41. Bandit Extends to the Trail Fighter.




          4.9.3.7.1 Initial Move. Bandit is assumed in a WEZ. With a Bandit in a WEZ, the
          first to gain tallyho should direct a break turn into the attacking Bandit. The break
          direction should always be called in the direction most advantageous for survival for
          the person being attacked. Generally speaking, the formation should break in the
          direction of whomever the Bandit is lined up on. If the Bandit is attacking from
          significantly above or below the horizon (more than 30°), the fighter directing the
          break should include the terms “up” or “down” respectively: “EAGLE ONE BREAK
          LEFT AND UP.” The element should execute their best DBFM and infrared missile
          defense (IRMD) while continuing to deconflict from each other.
          4.9.3.7.2 One Fighter Tally. The fighter with the tally must provide descriptive
          commentary to get the other pilot's eyes on the Bandit. This requires descriptive calls
          that isolate the Bandit in a portion of the other fighter's canopy and includes range.
          For example, if Eagle 2 were pointing out the threat to Eagle 1: “EAGLE ONE,
          BANDIT LEFT 7 O’CLOCK, 2 MILES, LEVEL.” Communication is required to add
          SA if the Bandit is clearly attacking one eagle or the other: “EAGLE ONE, BANDIT
          LEAN ON YOU” OR “EAGLE TWO ENGAGED, DEFENSIVE.” This way, the
          engaged and support roles are established even if only one fighter has tallyho.
          4.9.3.7.3 Establishing Roles and Execution. Once it is clear who the Bandit is
          focusing the attack on, the “ENGAGED/PRESS” calls should be made to establish
          roles. To allow an effective energy state for maneuvering, the support fighter should
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             85

          immediately select full AB and consider a sustained energy turn as soon as the
          Bandit's nose is off.
          4.9.3.7.3.1 No Switch. Optimal tactical formation discussed previously may limit the
          Bandit to see only one fighter. In this case, or due to a poor tactical decision, the
          Bandit may press the attack without regard to the other fighter. The support fighter
          should have a quick missile shot or transition to a gun WEZ. Since WEZ
          opportunities are fleeting, the support fighter should anticipate the WEZ and be
          prepared to shoot while ensuring weapons deconfliction is met. See Figure 4.42 for an
          example of the fight flow.

Figure 4.42. Defensive Perch (No Switch).




          4.9.3.7.3.2 Bandit Switch. A Bandit who stern converts on two fighters, both of
          which are seen, will usually attempt to switch to the fighter on the outside of the turn
          at some point after the fighters initiate their break. This could happen immediately
          (“Early Switch”) or after the Bandit pursues one fighter for a short time and then
          switches to the other (“Late Switch”). Typically, the inside fighter will see the
          Bandit's nose go to lag with LOS towards the outside fighter. Both fighters should be
          careful not to confuse a Bandit belly check or quarter plane with an actual switch.
          When the switch occurs, it must be quickly recognized and, if possible,
          communicated within the element. If it was not clear within the element who the
          Bandit was on, then use previously discussed calls to make it clear and establish roles.
          If roles had been established, call the switch and exchange of roles if necessary:
          “EAGLE TWO, BANDIT SWITCH,” “EAGLE TWO, ENGAGED,” “EAGLE
          TWO, PRESS.” As soon as the Bandit’s nose comes off to execute the switch, the
          defensive fighter must anticipate the three-dimensional (3D) merge geometry to
          assess whether his element mate will be able to execute the overall game plan and
          take the Bandit single-circle, or if the merge geometry requires the fighter to take him
          two-circle. If the Bandit has more than 1,500 feet of TR and/or 30° of lead turn at the

     merge, the merging fighter has no choice but to go two-circle with the Bandit to
     prevent putting himself in an immediate defensive position. If the Bandit has less than
     1,500 feet of TR and/or 30° of lead turn at the merge, the merging fighter can execute
     the overall game plan and force the Bandit into a single-circle fight. Whether the
     merging fighter forces a single-circle or two-circle fight will determine the support
     fighter’s follow-on maneuvering.
     4.9.3.7.3.2.1 Early Switch. An early switch will almost always allow the Bandit to
     gain greater than 1,500 feet of TR and/or 30° of lead turn. This forces the merging
     fighter to go two-circle. Prior to arriving at the merge the fighter should execute
     merge prep and establish roles. At the merge the now engaged fighter needs to call
     the VID. This can all be condensed into one comm call. “EAGLE ONE, MERGED,
     VID HOSTILE, 1’S ENGAGED” followed by “EAGLE ONE, PRESS” from Eagle
     2. Eagle 1 as the engaged fighter should execute his best two-circle BFM. As soon as
     the Bandit executes the early switch from Eagle 2 onto Eagle 1, Eagle 2 needs to start
     executing his smartest BFM while maintaining deconfliction, IAW the support
     fighter’s priorities. This scenario is the most difficult for the support fighter to
     maintain deconfliction because it stretches the formation to visual limits. The best
     game plan for the support fighter is to keep power in MAX, immediately set LV 45°
     to the horizon (pitchback picture) in the direction of the merge, and max perform the
     aircraft into the vertical. This will get the support fighter sufficiently off of the
     horizon, so that as the Bandit’s nose turns toward him, it will be difficult for the
     Bandit to see him. If the Bandit does see him, this maneuver ensures that the Bandit
     will not threaten him with his nose because it will allow the engaged fighter an easy
     WEZ opportunity if he does. This maneuver will also slow the support fighter’s
     forward ground track (in the same way scissors do) so that he can maneuver to a more
     mutually supportive position from the engaged fighter while maintaining WEZ
     separation for shots of opportunity. Weapons deconfliction, kill calls, and separation
     execution still apply as the fight matures and reaches those milestones. See Figure
     4.43 for an example of the fight flow.

          4.9.3.7.3.2.2 Late Switch. A late switch will almost always allow the merging fighter
          to gain some TR and lead turn on the Bandit as he executes his merge prep. At the
          very least the merging fighter should have a neutral merge and geometry that allows
          the merging fighter to drive a single-circle fight. Prior to arriving at the merge, the
          fighter should establish roles. At the merge, the now-engaged fighter needs to call the
          VID. This can all be condensed into one comm call. “EAGLE ONE, MERGED, VID
          HOSTILE, 1’S ENGAGED” followed by “EAGLE ONE, PRESS” from Eagle 2. As
          soon as the Bandit executes the late switch from Eagle 2 onto Eagle 1, Eagle 2 needs
          to start executing his smartest BFM while maintaining deconfliction IAW the support
          fighter’s priorities. The best game plan for the support fighter is to keep power in
          MAX, overrotate LV (G-awareness picture) to use altitude to get nose turned around
          quickly, and MAX G allowable (SRB). It may be difficult for Eagle 2 to keep sight of
          Eagle 1 at this point due to the geometry putting Eagle 1 at his dead six. Element
          deconfliction can still be assured due to SA that they are not in the same piece of sky
          at this point (nor will they be in the next 15 seconds), thereby negating the
          requirement to call “EAGLE TWO, BLIND.” It should be rather easy for Eagle 2 to
          maintain the tally on the Bandit throughout this turn. He should follow the Bandit
          until he hears Eagle 1 call “MERGED” and then look around the Bandit with a good
          search pattern to reacquire the visual on Eagle 1. If at this point Eagle 2 still is not
          visual, it warrants an “EAGLE TWO, BLIND” call. If Eagle 2 sees two aircraft but is
88                                                     AETCTTP11-1          4 SEPTEMBER 2009

          unclear of which aircraft is which, his next job is to figure out which aircraft is friend
          or foe. Use status comm as depicted earlier and offset the fight at the 11 to 1 o’clock
          position until tally/visual is regained. Once Eagle 2 is tally/visual (he knows who is
          who), he can point at the fight while assessing range for a valid AIM-9 opportunity
          with weapons deconfliction. Eagle 2 needs to be vigilant about assessing closure
          because the single-circle fight will quickly decay into a 150-knot joust for 3/9
          advantage. If Eagle 2 is faster than 250 to 280 knots, he can cause excessive closure,
          including the possibility of flying out in front of the fight prior to missile impact. See
          Figure 4.44 for an example of the fight flow.

                                BASIC SURFACE ATTACK (BSA)

5.1 Introduction. BSA is the building block for all air-to-ground missions. This chapter
addresses surface attack definitions, premission planning, delivery parameters, controlled range
patterns, and weapons delivery. Refer to Figure 5.1.
5.2 Surface Attack Definitions. Several surface attack terms must be understood for the fighter
pilot to fly the attack and arrive as close as possible to the planned weapons release window.
While these concepts are introduced and defined here, specific mechanics and further discussion
of how to use them starts at the “Roll-in” section later in this chapter. For more information
regarding the calculations and T-38C specifics, refer to Technical Order (T.O.) 1T-38C-34-1-1,
Air Crew Weapon Delivery Manual.
     5.2.1 AIM Off Distance (AOD). AOD refers to a distance beyond the target that is
     predictable for any weapons delivery. That distance is the no-wind projected flightpath of
     an aircraft (where the aircraft would hit the ground if the pilot did not recover) in a dive
     delivery.
     5.2.2 AIM Off Point (AOP). AOP is the point on the ground, long of the target, to which
     the aircraft must fly during the weapon’s delivery pass. The AOP provides a ground
     reference to fly the aircraft to until a track reference can be set.
     5.2.3 Dive Angle. Dive angle is the planned angle of dive for weapons delivery.
     5.2.4 Initial Pipper Placement (IPP). IPP is the angle from target to a point in the HUD in
     mils at track altitude.
     5.2.5 Initial AIM Off Angle (IAA). IAA is the angle between the AOP and the target at
     track altitude. IAA is setting the FPM a planned number of degrees above the target at track
     altitude.
     5.2.6 Initial Target Placement (ITP). ITP is the angular “distance” measured from the
     horizon to the target in degrees (adding IAA to the planned dive angle at track will always
     yield ITP). It is an excellent reference for knowing what type of wire you are on, but it is
     NOT a “track reference” and cannot be “set" at track altitude.
     5.2.7 Mil. Mil is a term commonly used by pilots as an abbreviation for mill radian
     (1/1,000th of a radian). Mils are used to measure sight depression or relative positions and
     sizes of objects as seen through the HUD. One mil is equal to 1 foot at a range of 1,000 feet.
     Another useful relationship is approximately 1° equals 17.45 mils. “Mils” are also
     sometimes used to reference the delivery parameters on the lineup card.
     5.2.8 Minimum Release Altitude (MRA). MRA is a contingency altitude. It allows the
     fighter to be fast, steep, or both (up to a limit), and still satisfies safe escape, safe separation,
     and fuze arming criteria. Units may compute MRA differently to reflect mission design
     series (MDS)-specific considerations.
     5.2.9 Planned Release Altitude. The expected release altitude based on attack planning and
     assumptions.
     5.2.10 Percent Bomb Fall Line (%BFL). Percent BFL is an alternate HUD track
     reference. In principle, it is exactly the same as IAA and serves the same purpose. The only
     difference is that the angular distance from the FPM to the pipper is described as a
90                                                      AETCTTP11-1          4 SEPTEMBER 2009

     percentage of total BFL. It is similar to IPP in that it is setting the pipper a known amount of
     mils below the target.
     5.2.11 Release Altitude. Release altitude is the altitude above the ground at which weapons
     delivery is accomplished.
     5.2.12 Track Reference. Track reference is a position or point in the HUD that is used to
     maintain or correct the aircraft to the planned wire. Some common track references used in
     weapons delivery are IAA and BFL (IPP).
     5.2.13 Tracking. Tracking refers to a portion of any dive weapons delivery that is devoted
     to the final alignment of aircraft sighting systems with the target. The amount of time
     associated is referred to as wings-level or tracking time.
     5.2.14 Track Altitude. Track altitude is the preplanned altitude at which your HUD track
     reference is valid. BFL and IAA relationships are only valid at track altitude.
Figure 5.1. Basic Concepts.




5.3 Mission Planning/Preparation. BSA mission planning starts with and is based on the type
of weapon used and the target. The use of a BSA conventional or tactical pattern simplifies most
of the planning by removing the target “weaponeering” and allows pilots to practice various
methods of attacking the target safely.
     5.3.1 Weather Planning. Check the ceiling height to evaluate possible delivery options
     both below and above the weather. Check the winds at the surface and at the track altitudes
     of each delivery planned and have that ready for the brief. Upper-level winds can have a
     dramatic effect on weapons delivery. Prevailing visibility and sun angle will affect ease of
     target and landmark identification. A call to the range should be made to get an eyes-on
     assessment of the weather and pass the delivery and target plan to the ranger. Additionally,
     aviation hazard advisory system should be checked prior to the brief and updated at step.
     5.3.2 Target Study. Review slides, pictures and diagrams of the range, target area, and
     planned targets for the mission. Note the position of the range tower, prominent visual
     features, and any avoid/noise sensitive areas. Check range NOTAMs if applicable and
     always reference the range regulation.
     5.3.3 Attack Planning. IFF student missions will be flown IAW the preplanned attacks in
     the in-flight guide. Review the attacks planned for your mission. In addition to the pattern
AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             91

      altitudes and airspeeds, commit to memory the information related to each individual event,
      to include: track altitude, ITP, IAA, %BFL, AOD, planned release altitude, and MRA.
      These numbers can be placed on a line-up card for reference in flight. Also, each pilot must
      be familiar with the training rules in AFI 11-214.
5.4 Ground Ops. Confirm the weapons menus are set up correctly to include delivery
parameters and break X altitude. Target coordinates and target elevation should be verified (or
entered if required) on the ground. Set the altitude warning to radar altimeter (“RALT”), and
choose a warning altitude that won’t distract from the mission but will provide timely SA and aid
in ground collision avoidance (refer to the squadron standards). In the upfront control panel
(UFCP) “HUD” menu, ensure that you select Drift (DRF) mode and not Drift-Cut-Out (DCO)
mode.
5.5 Range Entry. Prior to entering the range, flight lead will call the range operator who will
provide range entry clearance, the current altimeter, which targets are available, and additional
information IAW range regulations. Every member of the flight is responsible for understanding
this information and will acknowledge with position number after flight lead reads it back to the
ranger. The ranger may also provide current weather and wind information. Build SA on the
actual winds compared to the forecast you used to plan your attacks. As you approach the range,
check the winds at departure altitude on the multifunction display (MFD), listen to the surface
wind call from the ranger, and look for smoke or dust clouds from vehicles for additional surface
wind SA. Expect to enter the range in either route or tactical formation.
      5.5.1 FENCE-IN. An air-to-ground (A/G) fence check will normally be accomplished
      before entering the BSA pattern. While it may vary from flight to flight, it should include
      selecting A/G master mode constantly computed impact point (CCIP), constantly computed
      release point CCRP, or as briefed), the target steer point, and weapons program for the first
      event (A/A TACAN, IFF, and CMD IAW the brief). Set up NAVAIDs to aid in SA on the
      range course deviation indicator (CDI to run-in heading, captain’s bar on crosswind or base
      heading as a technique). A chaff/flare check may be accomplished as well. DO NOT
      perform a trigger/pickle check. Leave the master arm switch safe until within the range
      confines and directed or briefed to arm hot by your flight lead.
      5.5.2 G-Exercise. The flight lead may or may not perform a G-exercise. A G-exercise may
      be accomplished prior to entering the range boundaries or once established on the range,
      IAW the brief or unit standards. (AFI 11-214 does not require a G-exercise.)
      5.5.3 Spacer Pass. Once the flight is ready to enter the BSA pattern, the wingman will need
      to achieve a trail formation. A delay of 5 to 7 seconds en route or 2 seconds in tactical will
      provide for sufficient spacing behind the preceding aircraft.
5.6 Range Comm. With the exception of safety of flight calls (say position or KIO), full call
signs will be used when communicating on the range (for example, “VIPER 2’S BASE”). The
ultrahigh frequency (UHF) radio will be used exclusively to keep the Range Control Officer
(RCO) in the loop with high SA. Very high frequency (VHF) will be used by exception.
      5.6.1 Pattern Calls. Standard, required pattern calls are: “C/S BASE,” “C/S UP” (for
      tactical pop patterns), and “C/S IN DRY.” Flight members will use call sign or formation
      position as briefed. The calls should be made at the moment you crack your wings to start
      the turn. All members of the flight must listen carefully prior to transmitting. If another
92                                                       AETCTTP11-1          4 SEPTEMBER 2009

      fighter has called in dry, do not transmit until the RCO has given a “continue dry” (unless
      the transmission is for safety of flight).
      5.6.2 Base Call Considerations. The base call will be prefaced with “extended,” or “late.”
      These are used to increase the SA of following aircraft for station-keeping purposes. If
      forced to turn base somewhere other than the briefed ground track, add the appropriate
      description. The preface “late” is used in the same way as in the landing pattern. If turning
      base at the correct position but unable to transmit on time due to higher priority comm,
      delay the base call and preface it with “late.”
      5.6.3 "C/S OFF DRY." “C/S OFF DRY” will be called post safe escape maneuver (SEM)
      if you rolled in with intent to drop but ended up not pickling. Add the reason for not
      dropping ordnance to the off-dry call (for example, “EAGLE 2’S OFF DRY,
      PARAMETERS”).
5.7 Range Exit. Flight lead will add “C/S LAST PASS” to his base and in call and “C/S up for
the rejoin,” after completion of his safe escape. After pickle AND completion of a valid safe
escape, turn in the briefed direction and look for the preceding aircraft. Call off with number of
aircraft in sight, (for example, “C/S 3’S OFF, TWO AIRCRAFT IN SIGHT…”) and begin the
rejoin. If not all of the preceding aircraft are in sight, transmit the number of aircraft you do see
and continue to fly the briefed ground track, leveling off at your briefed “sanctuary” altitude.
Once visual with all of the preceding aircraft, notify lead and continue the rejoin.
5.8 Switches Safe/FENCE OUT. Flight lead will call for the FENCE OUT as a directive call for
all flight members to safe the master arm and CMD. Once safed, acknowledge in order by
position number. Complete the rest of the FENCE OUT as briefed or directed. Be aware that all
of this may be happening during the rejoin; task prioritize appropriately.
5.9 Abnormal Procedures:
      5.9.1 Fallout/Late Join Up. Have a game plan for how you will execute if any member
      falls out, both on the ground and in the air. If a flight member joins up late on the range, one
      technique is to have them hold above your current pattern altitude and flow them in to the
      last position in the flight.
      5.9.2 Weather. For a solid deck with good visibility underneath, eliminate the higher
      events. It gets trickier when there are scattered clouds that you are trying to work around, or
      the visibility underneath is marginal. Expect dry passes for clouds obscuring the target and
      more “SAY POSITION” calls. If weather will be a factor on final, or TR’s are in doubt,
      remain high and dry.
      5.9.3 Emergency Procedures (EP). For any EPs, be ready for a KIO call, including the
      RCO, and the flight lead to be directive. Most EPs can be handled by elements. Be sure to
      safe switches during KIO call.
      5.9.4 No Radio (NORDO). The NORDO aircraft should remain high and dry in the pattern
      and rock his wings on final. Once it’s determined an aircraft is NORDO, lead will be
      directive with the rest of the flight to recover that aircraft IAW standards/local procedures.
      With an EP, the NORDO aircraft should do the same thing unless an immediate single-ship
      recovery is warranted. If a single-ship recovery is warranted, avoid overflight of pattern
      ground track at the current pattern altitude and turn opposite the traffic pattern.
      5.9.5 Blind. If not visual with the preceding aircraft or if there is any doubt as to who
      you’re looking at after rolling out on crosswind, cross-check altitude and stay 500 feet away
AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             93

     from base altitude for the pattern being flown. If descending to the base altitude, remain
     above the base altitude. If climbing up to the base altitude, level off lower than the base
     altitude. Clear your flightpath and transmit “(position number for the aircraft in front of
     you), SAY POSITION.” The preceding aircraft should immediately answer the call with
     position and altitude. No other aircraft will transmit except those necessary to resolve the
     potential conflict. Follow-on calls must be as specific as possible.
            5.9.5.1 Post Blind – "Continue." If the visual is reacquired OR you have high SA
            for which you have adequate deconfliction, call “CONTINUE.” If on final and not
            directly involved in a “say position” situation, you may continue the pass and deliver
            ordnance unless a “KNOCK-IT-OFF” is called (assuming the RCO transmitted
            “CONTINUE DRY” prior to the “SAY POSITION”; if not, don’t request clearance –
            go through dry).
            5.9.5.2 Post Blind - "Knock It Off." If the situation cannot be immediately resolved,
            a “KNOCK-IT-OFF” should be called. All members of the flight and the RCO will
            acknowledge it; safe the master arm and fly the altitude, airspeed and ground track for
            the event flight lead is on. The blind aircraft will maintain briefed altitude
            deconfliction. Expect the flight lead to be directive and/or the preceding aircraft to
            give bearing, range, aspect, and altitude (BRAA) calls. Listen carefully and build SA
            on other members of the formation. When warranted, flight lead will direct the flight
            to continue weapons delivery (for example, “NEXT PASS HOT” or “GREEN’M
            UP”).
     5.9.6 Fouls. Two fouls or one dangerous foul on range will usually result in that flight
     member either holding high and dry or being directed to return to base (RTB). Use
     judgment based on the severity of the problems. Since the T-38C does not physically drop
     anything, it will be hard for anyone outside your jet to assess a foul. Fess up to foul
     situations so that you can learn from them.
5.10 Conventional Pattern Procedures:
     5.10.1 Purpose. The conventional pattern allows orderly, repetitive weapons delivery
     practice for up to four aircraft on the range. It is designed to allow you to get from one pass
     to the next as efficiently as possible to maximize learning basic diving weapons delivery.
     5.10.2 Conventional Pattern Overview. The conventional pattern is similar in structure to
     a standard landing pattern, with the following segments: crosswind, downwind, base, and
     final (Figure 5.2). While the basic pattern remains the same between different events,
     altitude and base position will change to accommodate the various release altitudes and dive
     angles. Depending on the event, a complete “lap” around the pattern will take only 1 to 2
     minutes or about 100 to 150 pounds of fuel. In addition to the required tasks for each
     segment of the pattern, you will have to maintain briefed altitude, airspeed, and ground
     track.

Figure 5.2. Conventional Pattern.




     5.10.3 SEM. All SEMs will be executed IAW T.O. 1T-38C-34-1-1. Using 4.1 to 4.3 Gs in
     the pull is a good technique to ensure the SEM is valid while minimizing the potential for
     an asymmetric over-G due to jetwash. Use caution on steeper events; airspeed errors and
     dive angle increase over-G potential. Rapid G application is not necessary; you have 2
     seconds to blend to 4 Gs. It is a good technique to complete an SEM anytime you commit
     your nose to the target, even if the decision is made not to release ordnance.
     5.10.4 Crosswind. The first priority after the SEM is to regain visual on the preceding
     aircraft. With 8,000 feet of pattern spacing, the preceding aircraft should be near 10 o’clock
     and hold steady on the canopy until rolling out on. You will be looking at almost tail aspect
     making the visual tougher to reacquire. When turning crosswind (or any other place in the
     pattern), realize that you may be turning inside the preceding aircraft (the "coffin corner").
     Look outside as well as inside your turn until you are sure your turn is clear.
     5.10.5 Check Spacing. After finding the aircraft in front of you, assess your pattern
     spacing; you should be 6,000 to 9,000 feet behind the preceding aircraft. The AAT can be
     used to back up a visual assessment of 6,000 to 9,000 feet. TCAS and a 2.5-NM primary
     flight reference (PFR) scope may also be used to back up visual assessment. If you are close
     or wide, then adjust your turn to downwind to either increase or close range. If you are
     adjusting your downwind turn, orient your downwind leg so that you will arrive over the
     briefed ground track at your turn to base. If you are Number 2 or Number 3 of a four ship,
     avoid airspeed deviations as they will affect the aircraft behind you; instead use geometry.
     Prior to “cutting” any corners, you must be visual or have SA with comm with all of the
     preceding aircraft. This will prevent an unaware, belly-up pull on the preceding aircraft that
     can create a midair collision potential in the form of a “coffin corner.”
     5.10.6 Downwind. Lead will establish the downwind leg ground track in the brief. This is
     not a fixed position and may be varied by individual pilots if required to adjust spacing. Use
     the time on downwind to prepare for the next pass and analyze errors from the previous
     pass.
AETCTTP11-1      4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             95

         5.10.6.1 Prepare for the Next Pass. While not all-inclusive, the following checks
         cover the minimum and highest priority tasks while on downwind. In addition,
         continue to evaluate pattern spacing and analyze winds; adjusting as necessary to fly
         the correct ground track for the planned weapons delivery and spacing. The following
         techniques help the aircrew develop habit patterns that can be applied in future
         aircraft. The individual checklist items are discussed in this chapter.
         5.10.6.1.1 T-A-G. An easy to remember acronym to aid in accomplishing downwind
         checks is T-A-G:
            T – Target/Weapons Program.
            A – Attack Numbers.
            G – Gas (Complete Ops Check).
         5.10.6.1.2 W-A-M-O-E. The W-A-M-O-E check is another common technique. It
         includes error analysis, which reminds aircrew to think through adjustments for the
         next pass.
            W – Weapons Mode (A, B, C…).
            A – Arm.
            M – Master Mode (A/G, CCIP).
            O – Ops Check.
            E – Error Analysis.
   5.10.7 Base. For accurate weapons delivery, base position is crucial. There are three major
   conditions required to begin a successful roll in: airspeed, altitude, and base distance. As
   you can see in Figure 5.3, there are nine places you can be, eight of which are not correct
   for a given set of weapons-delivery parameters. To arrive on the planned wire, base distance
   and altitude must be accurate. Airspeed deviations on base will cause you to devote
   excessive time on final to airspeed corrections. Shack your base parameters.
         5.10.7.1 Base References. The proper base distance can be achieved via two sources:
         ground reference and canopy codes. Using ground references in a commonly used
         pattern is advantageous for learning the basics of surface attack and establishing
         canopy codes. In a more tactical environment, you will have to use canopy codes to
         visually assess your base position. If a ground reference is available, select a lead
         point to begin the base turn so as to roll out pointing toward the reference (Figure
         5.3). Select MIL power, and execute a level turn with G to hold airspeed. While
         refining parameters on base, acquire the target. Another method used to set base
         distance is a visual assessment of the planned wire. This involves setting the correct
         target-to-canopy reference or "sight picture" while wings level on base (Figure 5.3).
         For no wind, put the target 1 1/2 fist widths above the canopy rail for a 10°, a fist
         width above for a 20°, on the canopy rail for a 30°, and for a 45°, the target will be a
         fist width below the canopy rail. These references are only valid when wings level, at
         the appropriate base altitude, and at a nominal sitting height which can be found in
         T.O. 1T-38C-34-1-1. These methods can be combined to help build the base sight
         picture and refine your base distance. For either method, the target should be your
         primary reference for planning the roll in.

Figure 5.3. Base References.




           5.10.7.2 Base Ground Track Corrections. To make a correction, angle in or out
           from the target, and then roll out. Once the picture is set, if time allows prior to the
           roll in, return to the original base ground track that is perpendicular to the planned
           attack heading. Generally, there is time for one correction on base. While base
           position may be slightly altered to adjust pattern spacing, it is discouraged as this
           requires changes to the roll in to get to the planned wire on final. If you are
           excessively close to the preceding aircraft, consider using a normal base position and
           go through dry on final. Subsequently, adjust your pattern spacing on downwind.
     5.10.8 Wind Corrections in the Conventional Pattern. When dealing with winds in the
     pattern, three adjustments need to be made: the lead point for your turn to base, the base
     position itself, and the heading to hold that ground track. For a headwind (on final), you will
     need to turn base slightly earlier compared to no wind. In addition, adjust the base distance
     closer to the target, and roll out with a crab into the wind. The opposite is true for a tailwind
     (on final). This will also affect the canopy references, so the target should be slightly closer
     to the canopy rail for a headwind or slightly further away for a tailwind. One finger width
     correction for each 10 knots of head/tailwind is a good ROT. For crosswinds (on final),
     adjust your roll in earlier or later, and expect to crab into the wind to achieve proper
     parameters.
5.11 Tactical Pattern Procedures:
     5.11.1 Purpose. Like the conventional pattern, the tactical pattern allows “canned” delivery
     pattern training. In the tactical pattern you will perform popup attacks. Popup attacks are
     flown when weather or threats force you to ingress the target at low altitude.
     5.11.2 Tactical Pattern Overview. There are two types of pop patterns that are flown in
     BSA: direct and indirect. Direct pop patterns involve a run-in directly to the target followed
     by an "action" where a turn is made a specific distance from the target to create an offset
     prior to rolling in. An indirect pop pattern is constructed so that the offset heading is flown
     immediately after rolling off of the base position. Both attacks allow for target acquisition
     during the pop and subsequent pulldown to a diving attack.
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                              97

    5.11.3 Tactical Pattern Spacing Fixes. If required, use geometry to correct spacing; do not
    use airspeed changes. Depending on the pattern and airspace limitations, you may adjust
    spacing on the turn to downwind or at base. The lead aircraft will turn at the briefed spots.
    All following aircraft should use the aircraft in front of them for timing the turn to base.
    5.11.4 Downwind. After completion of your SEM, turn to crosswind. Priorities and tasks
    during this turn remain the same as during the conventional pattern. Once turning on
    downwind, complete your error analysis. Basic analysis of your position on final relative to
    the planned wire remains the same as during the conventional patterns.
    5.11.5 Base Turn. Call “BASE” just like in the conventional pattern, select MIL power,
    and start a descending turn toward the run-in ground track/approach heading. The goal is to
    roll out pointed at the appropriate target/heading as close to your planned parameters as
    possible. For a direct popup attack, roll out with the TD container (diamond) centered in the
    pitch ladders (the FPM should be centered on the CCRP steering line). For an indirect pop
    up attack, roll out on the appropriate heading. During the turn, keep your attention outside
    the cockpit as you will be descending under G.
    5.11.6 Run-in. The cross-check during the run-in should start with airspeed and altitude.
    Accelerate to and maintain the planned airspeed for the action and stay at the briefed
    altitude above the ground (typically 500 feet above ground level [AGL]). After initial
    adjustments to airspeed and altitude, bring range to the target (in the NAV block in the
    bottom right corner of the HUD) and heading into your cross-check. For indirect patterns,
    flying a wind-corrected ground track is necessary to arrive at the proper pullup point. As the
    distance measuring equipment (DME) counts down to within 0.2 NM of planned action or
    pullup range, attention should stay on the range to the target to ensure a timely action.
    5.11.7 Action Point. For direct pops, the check turn at the action point is designed to set the
    target at a known angular distance off the nose. At the specified range, select MIL power,
    and execute a 3 to 4 G level turn for the appropriate amount of check angle and roll out.
    Several ground references may exist in the pattern to confirm the accuracy of the action
    point, the action heading, and/or the popup point. Attention should be outside with the
    priority being the ground. For indirect pops, there is no action; fly directly from the base
    turn to the popup point (Figure 5.4).

Figure 5.4. Indirect Pop Pattern.
98                                                     AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009

     5.11.8 Popup Point. Select MIL power and execute a 3-G pullup to the appropriate climb
     angle (15° for a 10 delivery and 30 for a 20 delivery). Call "C/S UP." The goal is to
     precisely fly the “climb wire,” acquire the target, and be ready for a timely pulldown.
           5.11.8.1 Cross-Check Pacing. Start with the FPM/pitch ladder, transition to the
           target, look back inside at the FPM, and finally, check altitude. For both the 10 and
           20 pop patterns, this pacing will get your eyes through the required items and back
           to altitude about 2 seconds prior to pulldown altitude.
           5.11.8.2 Target Acquisition. As noted above, after the climb angle is initially set, the
           next task is to find the target. The target should be just behind the canopy bow,
           slightly below the mirror. From there it will drift down and aft. For the 10 pop, when
           pulldown altitude is reached, the target will be in the “pocket” formed by the canopy
           rail and canopy bow intersection. For the 20 pop, the target will be further aft and on
           to just under the canopy rail at pulldown (Figure 5.5).

Figure 5.5. Pop Attack Pulldown Canopy Code.




           5.11.8.3 Climb Angle. It is important to double-check the FPM is at the desired climb
           angle after acquiring the target. It is common for it to drift high or low while you are
           finding the target. This leads to deviations in the “climb wire,” which in turn make it
           harder to roll out on final on the planned wire for weapon release. Trim as a technique
           to combat this effect.
     5.11.9 Pulldown Point. Anticipate the pulldown altitude, but there is no need to lead it. At
     pulldown altitude, execute an unloaded roll to put POM long of the target on the AOP, and
     start a 4-G pull.
           5.11.9.1 Pulldown LV placement. Your pulldown LV should be placed to keep your
           POM on the AOD, just like the conventional pattern. For the 10 pop, initially, this
           will equate to about 100 to 110° of bank (LV just past the horizon). For the 20 pop,
           you will have to overrotate further to about 135° of bank.
           5.11.9.2 Apex Cross-Check. Approaching the apex of the pulldown, a quick cross-
           check in the HUD is warranted to build airspeed SA. If it appears the aircraft will
           approach or slow below 300 knots, modulate the pulldown G to stay above 300 knots,
           or abort the pass and go through dry. This problem is more of an issue on 20 popup
           attacks with the aircraft below briefed airspeed prior to the popup point.
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                              99

    5.11.10 Rolling Out on Final. Just like the conventional pattern, as the target approaches
    the edge of the pitch ladders, begin a smooth rollout so that once wings level the target is
    centered in the pitch ladders. On the 20 attack, a rollout of ~135 is required to get back to
    wings level. It is important that the roll is unloaded; if this roll is loaded, the FPM may run
    well long of the AOP prior to finishing the rollout. Additionally, be aware that, compared to
    the conventional pattern, there are more opportunities to induce errors prior to rolling out on
    final that will put the aircraft somewhere other than on the exact planned wire. Knowing
    this, strive to be as precise as possible with airspeed, action/pullup range, G, climb angle,
    and pulldown altitude, as deviations in any of these areas can lead to follow-on problems.
    5.11.11 Final. Once rolled out on final, the 10 and 20 pop pattern finals are identical to
    those of the conventional pattern. Procedures from this point through the SEM are the same
    as the conventional pattern roll in through final and are discussed in paragraph 5.13.
5.12 Level Pattern Procedures:
    5.12.1 Level Pattern. The level pattern is similar in shape to the conventional pattern with
    the exception of a wider base distance; the flight lead will brief the specific ground track
    plan. Basic priorities and tasks remain the same as the conventional pattern; however, base
    distance does not impact weapons delivery like it does for diving events.
    5.12.2 Base. The base distance is not as critical in the level pattern, but a tight base will
    shorten the time on final. Call “BASE” and execute a MIL power descending turn. The
    amount of descent should be commensurate with the visibility. Strive to get at least half way
    down to 500 feet AGL during the turn. Remain higher if visibility requires, until the target
    references can be seen.
    5.12.3 Final. Lead the turn to final so as to roll out on the attack axis. Call “IN DRY,” while
    starting the turn. Continue the MIL power descending turn to roll out no lower than 500 feet
    AGL (FPM centered on the CCRP steering line if using CCRP). Get down to 500 feet AGL
    expeditiously, adjusting power to maintain 420 knots and trim the jet. If CCRP was used
    initially, select CCIP using the hands on throttle and stick (HOTAS). Make small
    adjustments in heading and crab angle to maintain the ground track with the BFL through
    the target. Anticipate the fast pipper track and pickle at the base of the target. Select MIL
    power at G onset and execute the briefed SEM.
5.13 Weapons Employment:
    5.13.1 Roll In. You should use the target as your reference for when to roll in; attempt to
    lead turn so as to roll out on final at the planned attack heading. Roll-in pacing will vary
    based on altitude and airspeed at the roll in. The lower and/or faster the aircraft is prior to
    roll in, the earlier the roll in should be. The roll in is used to transition from base to the
    planned wire, arriving on final at the planned attack heading, flying to the AOP. It is
    essential that the attacking aircraft’s POM remain on the AOP throughout the roll in.
          5.13.1.1 Communication and HOTAS. Upon cracking wings for the roll in, call
          “C/S, IN DRY.” The RCO may wait until visual to confirm that the aircraft is rolled
          out on the attack heading before calling “CONTINUE DRY.” Make another call if
          clearance is not received after a couple of seconds. Additionally, the RCO may
          respond to an “IN” call with “CONTINUE.” In this case, no response is required;
          continue the attack expecting to hear “CONTINUE DRY” shortly. Do not release
100                                                AETCTTP11-1          4 SEPTEMBER 2009

      ordnance unless/until the RCO calls “CONTINUE DRY.” If in CCRP, wait to go
      from CCRP to CCIP until rolling towards the target area to minimize the opportunity
      to accidentally release a weapon somewhere other than the impact area on the range.
      5.13.1.2 Roll-In Mechanics. While the target is your primary reference, eyes should
      transition from the target to the AOP in the roll in. The goal is to set the LV to start
      the aircraft tracking towards the AOP and then refine the LV to keep POM on the
      AOP. Adjust the LV as required during the end of the roll in to have the AOP set as
      precisely as possible prior to roll out.
      5.13.1.2.1 Initial LV Reference and Bank Angle. IFF conventional attacks are
      normally planned for 3 to 4 Gs. Approximate, initial LV ROTs are:
         10: LV 5° above the horizon (equates to approximately 100 ° of bank)
         20: LV on the horizon (equates to approximately 110° of bank)
         30: LV 10° below the horizon (equates to approximately 120° of bank)
         45: LV 30° below the horizon (equates to approximately 135° of bank)
      Note: These references are good for understanding where the LV should be for an
      accurate POM; however, in execution your attention should be on the AOP.
      Concentrate on pulling the gun cross or FPM toward the AOP and not directly to the
      target. Precise base parameters followed by a repeatable roll in are the best way to
      build the experience to “see” and fly to the planned wire.
      5.13.1.2.2 Using the Roll in to Compensate for Base Errors. If rolling in from an
      incorrect base position without correcting it or noticing it until time to roll in, it is
      possible to adjust the roll in LV to compensate. If the base position appears too far
      out, the turn should be flown level for the first 30° to 45° before overrotating toward
      the AOP. If the base position appears too tight, slightly overrotate (by 5° to 10° of
      bank) for the first portion of the turn, and then readjust the LV towards the AOP.
      5.13.1.2.3 Adding ITP to the Roll In. Initial target placement is a useful technique to
      refine LV control during the final portion of the roll in. ITP can be read directly off
      the pitch ladders as the target approaches the HUD (Figure 5.6 shows an ITP of 13°
      for the 10 low-angle high-drag [LAHD] roll in). Approximately two-thirds of the way
      through the turn, the FPM will approach the planned dive angle for the attack. As the
      target approaches the HUD FOV, an assessment of the wire is made to make
      adjustments to the final portion of the roll in, the earlier, the better. Assess where the
      target is tracking relative to the pitch ladder in the HUD. If it is trending towards a
      point that is greater than planned ITP, the aircraft is above the planned wire:
      overrotate slightly. The opposite is true if the target is trending towards a point on the
      pitch ladder that is less than ITP. In this case, raise the LV slightly. Making the above
      ITP corrections will get the aircraft closer to the planned wire at roll out.
      5.13.1.2.4 Rolling Out on Final. As the target approaches the edge of the pitch
      ladders, begin a smooth rollout so that once wings level the target is centered in the
      pitch ladders. This will compensate for any crosswind present; the target and pitch
      ladders will be offset downwind left or right with the BFL centered vertically through
      the target.
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            101


Figure 5.6. Adding ITP to the Roll In.




    5.13.2 Final. Once rolled out on the final attack heading, there are numerous items to cross-
    check and adjust in a relatively short amount of time (approximately 5 seconds).
          5.13.2.1 Fly to the AOP. If the base, roll in, and rollout portions of the pattern have
          been flown well, the aircraft should arrive on or near the planned wire and be pointing
          at the wind corrected AOP (while the flightpath marker will be close to the target’s
          6/12, the gun cross will be more offset left or right; pointed into the wind). Flying
          towards the AOP will help keep the aircraft on the planned wire and fly it to the
          correct point in space at release producing the desired weapons effects. If base
          distance or the roll in weren’t flown perfectly and the aircraft ends up off of the
          planned wire at rollout, adjustments can be made to converge back towards the
          appropriate wire to arrive as close as possible to the desired release point.
          5.13.2.2 AOP References. On range, AOD markers (easy to identify points at known
          distances), are helpful in judging where a particular AOP lies. If at roll out the AOD
          is not set, a positive push over or pullup must be made to put the FPM on the AOP.
          The earlier this is done the more time the jet has to correct back to the proper release
          point before release. Visually, the FPM should remain on the AOP through pickle.
          Different from HUD track references, AOD is valid at any altitude and so should be
          set and held from rollout to release. The use of the HUD references can be used on
          the range as well. HUD references are discussed later in this section. Regardless of
          the technique used, you will be setting dive angle by adjusting the FPM relative to the
          visual AOP or the target. DO NOT blindly adjust the FPM relative to the pitch
          ladders in an attempt to achieve the planned dive angle. Correct dive angle does not
          always indicate correct wire.
102                                               AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009

      5.13.2.3 Confirm Target Location. During any attack, make certain that the correct
      target has been identified; if unsure, abort the pass.
      5.13.2.4 Power Modulate. Build awareness and modulate the throttles as required.
      Assuming that roll in airspeed were flown, the following power adjustments to idle
      will generally result in a weapons release inside the airspeed window of 400 to 440
      knots:
         10°: 400 KCAS (half-way down final)
         20°: 380 to 390 KCAS (half-way down final)
         30°: 350 KCAS (at roll out)
         45°: as you start the roll in
      5.13.2.5 Correct 3/9. The target should be on or very near the BFL. Make a small
      change in bank to put the target on the BFL and roll out. Avoid ‘S’ing through final
      by attempting one small correction. Hold a small amount of forward stick pressure or
      trim so as not to let the FPM run during 3/9 corrections. If a big 3/9 correction is
      required, bank into the target pulling the BFL back to the target and roll out. A small
      amount of bank at pickle is acceptable but not ideal. Make big 3/9 corrections quickly
      as positive G on final will cause the nose to drift up away from your AOP.
      5.13.2.6 Make Adjustments a Track Altitude. IAA and %BFL are only valid at
      track altitude. Track altitude is planned to occur shortly after rolling out on final.
      With experience, you will be able to maintain awareness of track altitude as you dive
      through it by precisely using your HUD track reference right at track altitude. Until
      then, using your HUD track reference shortly after rolling out on final is a good
      approximation of track altitude.
      5.13.2.6.1 Using IAA. Once rolled out on final (at track altitude), pullup or push over
      as required to set the FPM the specified number of degrees (IAA) long of the target.
      If you rolled out on the planned wire, it should already be there with no adjustment
      required. Once it is set, the point on the ground now under the FPM is the AOP, and
      the aircraft must be flown to that point using the visual AOP techniques discussed
      above. The point of using a HUD reference is that it eliminates the need to visually
      estimate distances over the ground. Once the HUD reference tells you where the AOP
      is, however, flying to it is accomplished the same way.
      5.13.2.6.2 Using %BFL. All of the above principles associated with IAA are the
      same for %BFL. The only difference is that instead of setting the FPM relative to the
      target using degrees, you will use a position on the BFL relative to the total BFL.
      Once rolled out on final (at track altitude), pullup or push over as required to set the
      target at the specified percentage of total BFL (measured down from the FPM).
      5.13.2.6.3 BFL Delay Cue. There are times when the pipper is HUD limited (due to
      being excessively high, slow or due to heavy headwinds on final). In this case, the
      entire BFL is not displayed in the HUD. Real-time this is indicated to the pilot by the
      presence of the delay cue on the BFL (Figure 5.7). This rarely happens, however, if
      %BFL is used, plan to include the delay cue in the cross-check after rolling out on
      final; be ready to transition to IAA if required.
AETCTTP11-1        4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             103


Figure 5.7. Delay Cue.




5.14 Error Analysis. Once established on downwind, with SA on the aircraft in front of you,
assess your last pass relative to the plan. Both pilot-induced errors and wind can cause
deviations. Many pilot-induced errors can be fixed by returning to and reinforcing the original
game plan; common errors include: forgetting the throttles on final, roll in LV on the target, etc.
In other cases, you may need to move your base position, either because it was errantly flown or
to compensate for wind.
     5.14.1 Automatic Scoring Display. The automatic scoring display can aid in analyzing
     your delivery (Figure 5.8). Dive angle, altitude, and airspeed at release will be displayed. If
     you’re confident that your roll in and weapons-delivery mechanics were executed IAW your
     plan, consider moving your base position closer or further away from the target as required.
     Remember to account for winds; they may be different on range compared to the forecast
     for which you built your plan.
Figure 5.8. Auto Scoring Display.




     5.14.2 Wire Analysis. Wire analysis using the automatic scoring display is based on the
     dive angle and altitude at release (Figure 5.9).
           5.14.2.1 High/Steep (High, Converging Wire). You rolled out above the wire but
           likely found the correct wire with an accurate AOP.
104                                                     AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009

            5.14.2.2 High/On Planned Dive Angle (High, Parallel Wire). You rolled out above
            the wire but did not set the AOP (probably errantly set the planned dive angle).
            5.14.2.3 High/Shallow (High, Diverging Wire). You rolled out above the wire,
            didn’t set the AOP correctly, and subsequently let the FPM run long.
            5.14.2.4 Low/Shallow (Low, Converging Wire). You rolled out below the wire but
            likely found the correct wire with an accurate AOP.
            5.14.2.5 Low/On Planned Dive Angle (Low, Parallel Wire). You rolled out below
            the wire but did not set the AOP. (MRA was probably a factor.)
            5.14.2.6 Low/Steep (Low, Diverging Wire). You rolled out below the wire, did not
            set the AOP and subsequently “pushed” the FPM even lower. (This scenario is
            unlikely to happen as MRA will likely be a factor well before the pipper reaches the
            target.)
      5.14.3 Pipper Placement. Once you have started flying good parameters, you can begin to
      assess where you pickled. Did you pickle where you intended? If not, then on the next pass,
      do so while flying an on-parameters pass. If the pipper was on target, work to improve it by
      changing the spot that you pickle. One technique is to apply 1/2 correction in the opposite
      direction (a correction for a score of 69/12 would be to pickle 34/6).
5.15 High-Angle Strafe (HAS). HAS is defined as any strafe pass planned with 15° of dive or
greater. Currently, each fighter MDS executes HAS slightly differently. For example, F-15Es
typically use 20°; F-16s use 25°; and A-10s use 30° or greater. The minimum recovery altitude is
500 feet AGL day time and 1,000 feet AGL for night. HAS attacks are often planned to recover
above 1,000 feet AGL to allow the use of one set of numbers for both day and night. Units will
incorporate MDS-specific considerations when computing standardized attacks.
Figure 5.9. Wire Analysis.




      5.15.1 Pattern. HAS is flown out of the conventional pattern. During the downwind checks,
      ensure the correct target steer point is selected.
      5.15.2 Base Position. Because the AOP for strafe is the target and not a point beyond the
      target and the track time is longer than for a typical bombing pass, the base position will be
      wider than for a bombing pass of similar dive angle. The canopy code for HAS base
      position will look slightly wider than a bombing pass of the same dive angle as well. For
      25° HAS, use the same canopy code as for a 20° bombing pass. For 30° HAS, use
      approximately two fingers above the canopy rail (no wind).
AETCTTP11-1      4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            105

   5.15.3 Roll In. The roll in should be planned so as to roll out on the attack heading, pointed
   directly at target. This roll in will be very similar to the conventional 30 roll in. Use MIL
   power and call “C/S, IN DRY” once starting the turn from base. Switch to the strafe mode
   once starting the roll in. Remember that if switching from CCRP to strafe mode, it will
   require two clicks of the weapon mode switch. Use the target approaching the gun cross as a
   reference for when to roll out.
   5.15.4 Final. The CCIP gunsight will initially fall below the gun cross and horizontally will
   be positioned between the FPM and gun cross (if there are no crosswinds, the gun cross,
   FPM and gunsight will all be lined up vertically). Once tracking towards the target and slant
   range decreasing, the gunsight will rise closer to the gun cross. Track time will be longer
   than on a typical bombing pass, approximately 6 to 9 seconds.
         5.15.4.1 Initial Aiming References. Initially, pull the gun cross towards the target
         and set the bottom of the gun cross on the target. If there are crosswinds on final, put
         the target laterally halfway between the gun cross and FPM. Hold this picture (bottom
         of the gun cross on the target’s 3/9, with the target between the gun cross and FPM)
         and start to bring airspeed and slant range into your cross-check (Figure 5.10).
         5.15.4.2 Airspeed. Reduce power from MIL to idle as airspeed accelerates through
         350 to 370 knots.
         5.15.4.3 Slant Range. The T-38C “A-10” gunsight gives slant range in nautical miles
         immediately below the gun cross. The T-38C gunsight provides slant range in
         hundreds of feet in the lower right-hand corner of the HUD—a more difficult cross-
         check. With either pipper, as slant range decreases towards open fire range, refine the
         firing solution, easing the pipper to the target. Note: Once inside 4,000 feet, the “in-
         range cue,” or “hat,” is displayed on top of the T-38C pipper. This range is well
         inside of planned open fire range (and even inside of cease fire range!) for HAS, so it
         is of little use for HAS attacks.
   5.15.5 Open Fire/Cease Fire. Reference Figure 5.10. Use the slant range indicated below
   the CCIP gunsight (A-10 pipper) or in the bottom right corner of the HUD (T-38C pipper)
   to determine when to open fire. Different airframes open fire at different ranges. F-16s and
   F-15Es need to open fire with their 20mm cannon inside of 6500 feet slant range in order to
   achieve the minimum required bullet impact velocity for weapons effects. The A-10 with its
   30mm cannon can effectively open fire well outside of this range, target dependent. All
   platforms normally fire a 2-second burst. All airframes also attempt to “track – shoot –
   track” (TST); there should be enough time to be able to get a good 2-second burst before
   starting the climbing SEM. Thinking “track – shoot – track” will help ensure that the trigger
   is released prior to the SEM. In any case, cease fire and start the SEM once arriving at the
   cease fire slant range. The only requirement is to avoid a lazy pulloff; however, because of
   close proximity to the ground, it is generally briefed to treat the recovery similarly to a
   climbing SEM.

Figure 5.10. Strafe Final.




5.16 Low Angle Strafe (LAS). LAS is defined as any strafe pass planned with less than 15° of
dive and is normally planned for 10°. The minimum recovery altitude is 75 feet AGL. The
minimum cease fire slant range is 2,000 feet.
      5.16.1 Pattern. LAS can be flown out of the conventional or the pop pattern. During the
      downwind checks, ensure that the correct target steer point is selected. A technique is to
      reduce the altitude for the RALT warning or turn it off (expect to be less than 300 foot AGL
      prior to cease fire slant range).
      5.16.2 Base Position. Because the AOP for strafe is the target and not a point beyond the
      target, and the track time is longer than for a typical bombing pass, the base position will be
      wider than for a bombing pass of similar dive angle. The canopy code for an LAS base
      position from the conventional pattern will look slightly wider than a 10° bombing pass.
      Use a canopy code of two fist widths above the canopy rail.
      5.16.3 Roll In. The roll in should be planned so as to roll out on the attack heading, pointed
      directly at the target. This roll in will be very similar to the conventional 10 roll in. Use
      MIL power and call “C/S, IN DRY” once starting the turn from base. Switch to the strafe
      mode once starting the roll in. Remember, if you are switching from CCRP to strafe mode,
      it will require two clicks of the weapon-mode switch. Use the target approaching the gun
      cross as a reference for when to roll out.
      5.16.4 Final. The CCIP gunsight will initially fall below the gun cross and will be
      horizontally positioned between the FPM and gun cross (if there are no crosswinds, the gun
      cross, FPM, and gunsight will all be lined up vertically). Once tracking towards the target
      and slant range decreases, the gunsight will rise closer to the gun cross. Track time will be
      longer than on a typical bombing pass, approximately 6-9 minutes.
            5.16.4.1 Initial Aiming References. Initially, pull the gun cross towards the target
            and set the bottom of the gun cross on the target. If there are crosswinds on final, put
            the target laterally halfway between the gun cross and FPM. Hold this picture (bottom
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             107

         of the gun cross on the target’s 3/9, with the target between the gun cross and FPM)
         and start to bring airspeed and slant range into the cross-check (Figure 5.10).
         5.16.4.2 Airspeed. Like the 10 conventional bomb final, reduce power from MIL
         (stand up the throttles) as airspeed accelerates through 390 knots.
         5.16.4.3 Slant Range. The T-38C “A-10” gunsight gives slant range in nautical miles
         immediately below the gun cross. The T-38C gunsight provides slant range in
         hundreds of feet in the lower right hand corner of the HUD—a more difficult cross-
         check. With either pipper, as slant range decreases towards open fire range, refine the
         firing solution, easing the pipper to the target. Note: Once inside 4,000 feet, the “in-
         range cue,” or “hat,” is displayed on top of the T-38C pipper. This range may be
         inside of planned open fire range for LAS, so it may be of little use.
   5.16.5 Open Fire/Cease Fire. Use the slant range indicated below the CCIP gunsight to
   determine when to open fire. Different airframes open fire at different ranges. F-16s and F-
   15Es need to open fire with their 20mm cannon inside of 6,500 feet slant range in order to
   achieve the minimum required bullet impact velocity for weapons effects. The A-10 with its
   30mm cannon can effectively open fire well outside of this range, target dependent.
   All platforms normally fire a 2-second burst; attempt to “track – shoot – track”; there should
   be enough time to get a good 2-second burst before starting the climbing SEM. Thinking
   “track – shoot – track” will help ensure that the trigger is released prior to the SEM. In any
   case, cease fire and start the SEM once arriving at the cease fire slant range if directly over
   the foul line or the break “X” starts to flash. The only requirement is to avoid a lazy pulloff;
   however, because of close proximity to the ground, it is generally briefed to treat the
   recovery similarly to a climbing SEM.
   5.16.6 Alternate Panels. Normally on a controlled range, there will be at least two active
   panels. A common technique is to strafe alternate panels (that is, if number one chooses
   panel one, then number two strafes panel two; number three strafes panel one, etc.). This
   allows time for the dust to clear on that panel from a previous pass. If the flight is using
   more than one panel, add “PANEL ONE” (or two as required) to your “in” call.

                                           Chapter 6
                           SURFACE ATTACK TACTICS (SAT)

6.1 Overview. Although several definitions of SAT exist throughout the CAF, for the purposes
of this chapter, SAT will be the bridge between BSA sorties and close air support (CAS). This
mirrors the A-10 community’s use of the acronym and purpose of the sortie. SAT is the first time
you will be asked to find the bombing/strafing wire without the use of ground references like
base distance and AOD. Additionally, you will be introduced to the TACS, two-ship attack
profiles and geometry, and mutual support contracts, both from medium and low altitude.
6.2 Mission Planning. Detailed mission planning is the key to success in the SAT phase. In
addition to the standard BSA mission planning tasks, you and your IP will discuss a kill
container type scenario. You will need to provide copies of target area maps (1:50,000) and/or
imagery (1:5m). Learning as much as possible about the target area, lead-in features, and
environmental and target descriptions will reduce your workload during the target ID stage of the
sortie. Typically, a 1:50,000 scale map, with military grid reference system (MGRS) grids
clearly depicted will be most handy in the air. Target imagery can be helpful in the brief more
than in flight, but having it on hand in the air could prove useful. In addition, SAT mission
planning is the first opportunity to understand how combat weapons delivery software can assist
in computing attack parameters. The SAT brief will consist of target area discussions, weapons
delivery, your flight lead’s contracts, and attack geometry. Know the range regulations and the
A/S training rules.
6.3 Ground Ops. The majority of the changes to your avionics and UFCP can and should be
made on the ground. The EGI steer-point plan should match your flight lead (the card) in order to
avoid confusion in the air when discussing different targets. Most scenarios will involve an
initial point (IP) for reference, and two or more steer points with preplanned target coordinates.
You will also be simulating weapons other than BDU-33s, so you will update the weapons menu
on the MFD to reflect your simulated weapons. Your flight lead will also be directive as to what
weapons program will be assigned to each bomb type and delivery parameters. Because you will
probably have more products than you are used to, a good discussion on cockpit organization is
warranted.
6.4 Departure. Flight plans to and from the range will be standard. A low level that can lend
itself to low-altitude ingress may also be used. Expect to fly only a few legs of the low-level to
save gas for the SAT. Flying a stereo and canceling early enough to ingress the range at hold
altitude may also be a viable tactic for your low-altitude ingress. Your priorities when flying
this departure are mutual support providing visual lookout and communication to keep
your flight safe from threats (both real and simulated). Some of the TACS coord can be done
on the ground, and some en route to the range, so be ready for both.
6.5 Mutual Support. The reason fighters fly in formation is to provide one another with mutual
support. Mutual support in its basic form is visual lookout, communication, and firepower.
Everything we do in IFF is a building block to get to this point. You learned how to fly
formation; provide clear, concise, correct communications; and how to employ simulated
weapons through the various phases of IFF. Now it’s time to combine them all in what could be
a real-world mission. Your flight lead will brief you on how the flight is going to provide and
maintain mutual support throughout the entire sortie.
AETCTTP11-1        4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             109

6.6 Theater Air Control System. The TACS provides the commander the capability to plan and
conduct joint air operations. The purpose of this document is to provide an introduction to TACS
for the pilot and not to build a complete command and control (C2) system. There are many
facets to TACS, but this document will focus on information gathering from the pilot’s
perspective in the jet, and specifically to the IFF syllabus. For an indepth reading on TACS,
reference Joint Publication 3-09.3, Close Air Support, Chapter II.
Information gathering for a SAT sortie will begin in the brief. Performing thorough map study
and having a working knowledge of the scenario will lessen confusion airborne. Normal
premission planning cannot be overstressed. This is the start of what is known as “filling your
SA cup.” (Figure 6.1.)

Figure 6.1. SA Cup.




    6.6.1 AWACS/Control and Reporting Center (CRC). The AWACS is an airborne
    platform designed to provide the air picture to the war fighters. The CRC is the same type of
    system but is based on the ground. Both can provide almost the same information. When
    checking in with them, your flight lead or you, if so tasked, will provide them with the
    following information: call sign, mission number, and position relative to bull’s-eye (B/E).
    Expect that they will want to authenticate you with a known code. Information that is
    provided to you is a sweet-and-sour check of your IFF/selective identification feature (SIF)
    system (covered more in your MDS) and the picture of the airspace. They can provide you
    status of tankers, fighters and other players in the area of operations (AO) as well.
    6.6.2 Air Support Operations Center (ASOC). The ASOC is the focal point for all the
    Army ground requests for air support. The Navy and Marines also have a similar unit.
    When you contact the ASOC, you will provide them with call sign and mission number.
    Once again, expect authentication procedures. They should provide you with an AO update
    consisting of: threats, targets, friendlies, artillery, clearance authority, and possibly target
    area weather. They should also give you the call sign and frequency of the forward air
    controllers (airborne) (FAC(A)) or joint terminal attack controllers (JTAC) in your assigned
    area of responsibility (AOR). During the SAT phase, you may not get all of this information
    due to training limitations. The ASOC is also where you will provide an in-flight report
110                                                      AETCTTP11-1          4 SEPTEMBER 2009

      upon exiting the AO. The in-flight report consists of: call sign, mission number, location
      (coordinates), time on target, results, and any other remarks (for example, weather, threats,
      significant sightings).
      6.6.3 FAC(A)/Fighters. Once in the AO and if present, your flight will contact the FAC(A)
      or the fighters that are leaving before you. You can always ask them for any updates to the
      AO. Usually, these players will have good SA and information about your AOR. If a
      FAC(A) is present, expect to work with him throughout your AO time slot.
      6.6.4 JTACs. JTACs are enlisted Air Force personnel assigned to work with the Army.
      They are trained much like an FAC(A) on how to control air assets from the ground in order
      to destroy targets. They are on the front lines putting eyes on targets that the ground
      commander wants or needs destroyed. They will generally have the highest SA on what
      targets need to be hit. However, they can have limitations due to their positions on the
      ground such as radio LOS, visual LOS to targets, etc. During SAT training, you will likely
      not talk to or have a simulated JTAC. Having a JTAC on the ground in your scenario
      generally implies that there are other friendly forces in the area. This situation requires
      detailed coordination with ground forces in order to safely affect the battlespace.
      Employment in this situation is called CAS and beyond the scope of this chapter.
      6.6.5 Flight Lead Eyes On. Finally, once the flight is established in the AOR, the flight
      should have all the pertinent data with respect to Threats, Targets, Friendlies, Artillery and
      Clearance (TTFAC). He can now use all the data gained through the TACS coord and
      compare it with what the flight is seeing on the ground. With that information, the flight
      lead can make an informed decision on how best to maximize the flight’s mutual support to
      achieve the desired effects of the battle space.
6.7 Medium-Altitude Tactics. There are several reasons why one would choose medium
altitude tactics. Oftentimes, flight leads are forced into medium-altitude tactics due to constraints
from higher headquarters. In these cases, the threat is generally low, and medium-altitude tactics
offer a safer margin from error. These tactics can aid the pilot in consistently being able to have
eyes on the target area. It also increases LOS capabilities for communication and loiter time due
to gas savings. Some drawbacks include not being able to positively identify friendly versus
enemy forces, susceptibility to unknown threats, weather issues and, in some cases, weapons
effects. All these factors are part of the flight lead’s mission planning and are always being
updated once in the battle space.
      6.7.1 Medium-Altitude Tactical Administration. Once the flight is established in the
      AOR, or in the case of IFF, the range, some tactical administration has to be accomplished.
      Expect the flight lead to check in with the ranger and call for the FENCE-IN. FENCE-IN
      according to the brief and fly the briefed formation. The flight may or may not execute a G-
      exercise. Next, expect the flight lead to establish the flight into some sort of holding pattern
      from which to attack.
      6.7.2 Medium-Altitude Holding. The most common hold in the daytime medium-altitude
      arena is the wheel. Although any fighter pilot, if given the option, would prefer a left-hand
      wheel in order to facilitate left-hand roll ins, you should strive to see both right- and left-
      hand wheels. In the future, your main sensor will be the targeting pod, and your wheel
      directions will depend on which side of your jet the pod is mounted. Other holding options
      are offset figure 8, bone holding, and random holding. Depending on the tactical situation,
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               111

    your flight lead may choose one over another to maximize mutual support. Be attentive in
    the brief to see what holding is expected, but be ready for whatever the tactical situation
    requires once in the AOR.
    6.7.3 Medium-Altitude Execution. In the T-38, the most common medium altitude
    deliveries are 30 dive bomb (DB) and 30 HAS. Typical base altitudes for these deliveries
    are in the 8,000 to 10,000 AGL regimes. As such, your hold will be in a similar altitude
    regime. At approximately 3 NM from the target area, a 10,000-foot hold allows a
    comfortable 30° to 45° of constant bank at 300 KCAS. One formation you may fly is a trail
    position (Figure 6.2). Using the canopy reference shown here (Figure 6.3), 1.0 to 1.5 NM on
    the AAT will help you hold a good position. Another good holding formation is wedge
    (Figure 6.2). This allows the wingman to hold high and outside the flight to provide better
    mutual support. The wingman may burn more gas being on the outside but by using altitude
    and geometry, it can be avoided. One technique to avoid getting stripped and falling to trail
    is to close in the range from 6,000 to 9,000 feet to 3,000 to 6,000 feet. Some flight leads
    may refer to this as “Combat Trail.”

          6.7.3.1 Attack Roles. While established in the AO, you will spend a great deal of
          time looking outside and listening to the radio to gather all the information you need
          about the next attack and to find the target. For each attack, you will have a specific
          role. Your flight lead will brief you on exactly what is expected of you for each of his
          attacks. As a result, in the air he will pass the Fighter-to-Fighter brief over interflight
          radio. Typically, it will be in the format: Formation, Role, Ordnance, Timing, In and
          Off Directions, and a Sort. Your contract/responsibilities for each of these roles will
          be briefed. Here are some examples of the types of roles you might expect.
112                                                   AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009


 Shooter – Employing ordnance
 Cover – Guaranteeing mutual support with visual and comm
 Suppressor – Employing to suppress enemy defenses (so similar to ‘shooter’ that it’s rarely
               used)
 Recce – Building target area SA with visual lookout (you are always recce)

          From medium altitude, you can expect your flight to run either Shooter/Cover or
          Shooter’s attacks. With this in mind, your job leaving the hold will be to maneuver
          your jet to a good base position for the delivery or to a mutually supportive formation
          while your flight lead employs.
          6.7.3.1.1 Cover. If you are tasked to the cover roll, you will stay in the wheel at
          altitude while providing your flight lead with visual lookout and comm mutual
          support. Continue to fly the same ground track while lead rolls in. You will be almost
          looking down your flight lead’s tail pipes as he pickles. This position will build your
          SA on the target, as well as give you a great view of the section of earth he can’t see,
          behind and underneath his jet. Your lookout priorities are 1) underneath flight lead, 2)
          the area around the target, 3) the immediate target area, and 4) your flight lead
          (Figure 6.4). Your flight lead will recover from the attack with the following
          priorities: SEM, clearing his six with 3D maneuvers, and then finding you. Typically,
          lead is assumed to be blind off target, while you are assumed to be visual in the cover
          role. The attacker, in this case the flight lead, should call visual after the 3D
          maneuvering and prior to establishing himself in the hold. Even prior to lead
          regaining the visual, you may see the need to maneuver to regain your position.
          Always strive to use geometry to fix your spacing verses just power.

Figure 6.4. Lookout Priorities.




          6.7.3.1.2 Shooter. When you are directed to drop, lead will assume the mutual
          support and deconfliction contracts that are normally your responsibility. You should,
          however, strive to stay close to the briefed formation position until you start
          maneuvering to a good base.
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                              113

          6.7.3.1.2.1 Finding Base. While accelerating to base airspeed, you should maneuver
          to the correct base altitude and distance. Your primary reference for base distance is
          the canopy references that you learned on your conventional range sorties. This
          canopy reference is only valid from a wings level attitude and heading 90° to the
          desired attack heading, no wind. The tendency to ‘mothball’ or fly closer to the target
          in order to see it better will often lead you to be in a banked turn while establishing
          your known canopy reference. This results in being too steep to employ due to the 5°
          steep TR stop. In an effort to combat this problem, most pilots will ‘square off’ the
          last portion of their base turn in order to be both 90° out to the desired run-in heading,
          as well as allow a wings level canopy reference assessment (Figure 6.5).

Figure 6.5. Medium-Altitude Attack Pattern.




          6.7.3.1.2.2 Finding the Attack Heading. A common error when executing wheel
          attacks is overshooting the desired final attack heading. A common technique for
          finding the right heading on final involves the use of your horizontal situation
          indicator (HSI). You should be in the blue EGI mode during these sorties with the
          target coordinates plugged into the current steer point. Cross-check your blue bearing
          needle and start your roll-in when the bearing pointer is about 15° from getting to the
          desired heading. Some pilots choose to mark their desired attack heading with the
          heading bug or CDI. Remember that flying a base position approximately 90° to your
          desired attack heading will make it easier to visualize the proper point at which to
          roll-in.
          6.7.3.1.2.3 Finding the Wire. Realize that you will probably not be perfect when
          trying to find the right base position on your first few attempts. Don’t be afraid to
          ‘BFM the wire’ when you realize you are close or wide of the planned base distance
          just as you learned in the SA phase (see paragraph 5.13.2.4).
          6.7.3.1.2.4 The Roll-In and On Final. In the medium-altitude regime, target ID
          should be taken care of prior to rolling in. During roll-in, if your target is small or
          difficult to break out based on surrounding features, using the EGI target designator
114                                                  AETCTTP11-1        4 SEPTEMBER 2009

         container (TDC) is a viable target acquisition aid. With these types of targets, it is
         common to pull directly to the target since you are padlocked on it, putting you on a
         low wire. Remember to pull your FPM long and upwind of the target initially. Your
         best guess for an approximate AOD will get you in the right ballpark, and using ITP
         halfway through roll-in can help, then you can refine your AOP on final with IAA or
         %BFL. It is also common for the basics like power control and pipper placement to
         fall out when task saturated finding the wire. Be methodical about pull, center, set,
         your throttle technique, and get the BFL through the target.
         6.7.3.1.2.5 Wind Corrections. If you have no attack heading restrictions, and there is
         a significant wind aloft, consider rolling in based on the wind direction. As a general
         rule, tail winds are best because they push your bombing solution up in the HUD
         making for an easier pass. Headwinds have the opposite effect, but can be easier to
         handle than a crosswind. Remember that the basic canopy references must be
         corrected for wind. A good ROT is one finger width for the first 20 knots of
         headwind or tailwind (on final) and an additional finger for every 10 knots above that.
         An example, if planning a west to east final attack heading and the winds are 30 knots
         out of the west, you should fly your target two finger widths above the no-wind
         reference. Crosswinds should be avoided if possible but can be combated by
         centering the target in the pitch ladders at rollout and keeping the BFL on the target.
         6.7.3.2 Medium-Altitude Tactics:
         6.7.3.2.1 Shooter/Cover. The most basic of medium-altitude two-ship tactics is the
         shooter/cover role. This tactic maximizes mutual support but can sacrifice firepower.
         Fly your jet into a position that gives you a good view of the ground underneath lead.
         Continue to fly in the same wheel and altitude while lead rolls in. As he completes his
         SEM, adjust your wheel to end up in a mutually supportive formation on him once
         again. Be ready to build his SA about your position if he asks for you posit. (Figure
         6.6). Notice that you will use dry, JCAS comm to build good habit patterns.

Figure 6.6. Medium-Altitude Shooter/Cover.
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                          115

           6.7.3.2.2 Cover/Shooter. Role swap, Number 2 is the shooter and lead is cover. The
           key to success is getting yourself into a good base position. Stay in position in the
           wheel until you are about 90° out from your desired run-in heading. Square off the
           last 90° before you roll in to make your base canopy references familiar and valid.
           Adjust your base distance as appropriate with your wings level when you check your
           canopy reference. Remember the technique that you are assumed to be blind off
           target. A visual call will be required, if visual and once the attack and 3D
           maneuvering is complete. You can expect your flight lead to be between your 10
           and 2 o’clock once off target (Figure 6.7).
           6.7.3.2.3 Shooters. Another common medium-altitude two-ship tactic is the
           shooter/shooter roles—both aircraft expend ordinance. This attack maximizes
           firepower but can sacrifice mutual support. This is most often used for multiple
           targets, hasty attacks and Troops-In-Contact (Figure 6.8).

Figure 6.7. Medium-Altitude Cover/Shooter.          Figure 6.8. Medium-Altitude Shooters.




         6.7.3.3 Off-Target Priorities. There are several tasks to accomplish once you have
         pickled. Be sure to prioritize flying the jet first as always.
         6.7.3.3.1. Valid Climbing SEM. Your first priority after weapon release is a valid
         SEM. The mechanics and parameters of the climbing SEM remains the same as the
         BSA pattern. Realize that the purpose of this maneuver is to keep you safe from the
         ground, the frag of your own weapon, and to get you away from threats in the area as
         quickly as possible. In the IFF SAT environment, there are no simulated threat
         reactions, but you should start practicing clearing your six, maneuvering three
         dimensionally, and flying the briefed geometry to help regain the visual and get back
         to a mutually supportive formation.
         6.7.3.3.2 Clear Your Six. Use preemptive CMD to decoy IR and radar threats. In all
         cases, your primary defense against anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) is three-dimensional
         maneuvers. In a medium-altitude (low-threat) environment, your climbing SEM will
116                                                      AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009

            already have you moving in two dimensions; some minor check turns left and right
            while you climb back to hold altitude will suffice. Be sure not to bleed too much
            airspeed and get yourself to a low-energy state so that if a threat does become a
            factor, you have some energy to react to it.
            6.7.3.3.3 Find Your Flight Lead. Expect lead to be between your 10 and 2 once you
            have turned 60° to 90° off of the attack heading. You will be assumed blind off target.
            Your lead will typically give you a few seconds following your SEM to move your jet
            IAW the contracts and to find him. If you don’t find him (or don’t call it) in a timely
            manner, he will talk your eyes back on. He should also give you a basic altitude
            deconfliction plan in the brief if you are blind for an extended period of time.
            Remember to continue flying the geometry briefed even if you don’t see lead and
            maintain the altitude deconfliction. In other words, turn back into the wheel around 3
            miles vice extending several miles outside the fight.
            6.7.3.3.4 Get Back into Position. Even with an 8,000-foot hold, you will find
            yourself low on energy when trying to get back into formation on lead. Remember
            that a good SEM will increase your energy. Beyond that, the best you can do is keep
            the power in MIL and use geometry/cutoff to regain correct distance from Number 1.
6.8 Low Altitude. There are two main reasons why one would be forced into low-altitude
tactics. It is usually derived from threats in the AO or from weather. These tactics demand a
much higher level of SA and attention to detail than medium-altitude tactics. The biggest focus
of low-altitude tactics is task prioritization. SAT sorties are demanding on their own, and much
more so when having to perform all the tasks at low altitude. Remember, the biggest threat at
low altitude is the ground. Some benefits of low-altitude tactics are surprise and in some cases
weapons effects. Some drawbacks are not being able to identify the target, susceptibility to
threats, and decrease in fuel efficiency, not to mention increased task loading. All these factors
are part of the flight lead’s mission planning and are always being updated once in the battle
space.
      6.8.1 Low-Altitude Tactical Admin. Low-altitude tactical administration will be the same
      as medium altitude. However, task prioritization is a must. Mutual support isn’t just looking
      out for threats; it’s keeping each other honest with respect to basic aircraft control as well.
      6.8.2 Low-Altitude Holding. There are several ways to hold low altitude; however, the
      large turn radius of the T-38C limits these options. Here, in IFF, you will hold one of two
      ways: Racetrack or Figure 8 at approximately 2,000 feet AGL and 350 KCAS. The shape of
      both is relatively self-explanatory. More specifically, however, you as the wingman should
      always strive to be in wedge outside of your flight lead looking through him to the target
      and threat area. Also, whenever possible, your flight lead will attempt to make his holding
      turns towards the target area. The main reasons for this are target area SA and target ID. By
      swinging your nose through the target area you keep your visual lookout up and, if able,
      build your target area SA via a quick steer-point diamond check as the target area passes
      through your HUD. During low-altitude holding, you must be eyes outside the cockpit
      during any turns.
            6.8.2.1 Figure 8 (Figure 6.9). In the figure 8 hold, you will again be outside of your
            lead in a line or wedge formation. Your flight lead will turn away from you towards
            the target at both ends of the hold.
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                           117

          6.8.2.2 Race Track (Figure 6.10). In the racetrack, you will be outside of your flight
          lead in line or wedge formation. Your flight lead will turn as required to keep the
          flight in the hold; your job is to use geometry so that you always end up on the
          outside of flight lead, opposite of the threat and target area.

Figure 6.9. Low-Altitude Wedge Figure 8.        Figure 6.10. Low-Altitude Wedge Racetrack.




    6.8.3 Low-Altitude Execution. Most likely, you will only execute shooters attacks in a
    low-altitude (high-threat) environment. The concept is that you are not going to stick your
    nose into the bee’s nest without being offensive in some way. So walking out of the brief
    you already know your role to be shooter; now your biggest concern is flying the briefed
    geometry and employing valid ordnance. Remember, the first time you pop your toughest
    task will be target ID, so good target area study in the brief is key. Although you will see
    other formations in the future, most attacks low altitude are done from wedge or trail.
    Below, you will see wedge attacks as common examples of the attacks that you will execute
    in IFF SAT/CAS missions.
          6.8.3.1 Exiting the Low Altitude-Hold. Since you should be on the outside of the
          hold looking through lead, he will most likely be turning away from you and,
          therefore, you must be ready to take advantage of the geometry and your energy to
          expeditiously achieve the attack formation on the appropriate side.
          6.8.3.2 General Contracts:
          6.8.3.2.1 Fly Off of Lead. After exiting the hold, flow out to the 45° to 60° wedge
          cone, and strive to maintain at least 1 NM spacing. At the same time, the flight as a
          whole will be descending to 500 foot AGL and accelerating to 420 knots. Fly off of
          your flight lead, remembering to not fly below his altitude, and you will end up pretty
          close to your desired parameters. Cross-check your RALT, AAT, and KCAS as
          required.
          6.8.3.2.2 Action With/In the Same Direction as Lead. At the appropriate range for
          his attack, your flight lead will action to pop. When you see his wings crack for this
118                                                  AETCTTP11-1        4 SEPTEMBER 2009

         maneuver, you should also begin your action. How much you action will depend on
         the attack.
         6.8.3.2.3 Pop Off of DME. Your flight lead will give you visual cues for when you
         should be popping. This is usually a specific time in his attack such as wings level on
         final, or at pickle. These are good cues, but when dropping bombs, your parameters
         are so specific you will need to use DME from the target as your primary reference
         for when to pop. The gun is a much more flexible weapon, so you can use your flight
         lead’s cues as primary, but a DME backup will also be given.
         6.8.3.2.4 Ensure CFOF. If you didn’t maintain at least 1 NM spacing between the
         jets, you may find yourself rolled out on final ready to shoot with lead still in the
         HUD. In all cases, you must comply with applicable ROE regarding CFOF. If you
         cannot, come off dry.
         6.8.3.2.5 SEM Into Lead. Always make your turning maneuver level turn in the
         same direction that your lead egresses.
         6.8.3.3 Low-Altitude Attacks. Tactics will drive numerous variations in low-altitude
         attacks; below are some sample attacks that emphasize various roles and attack
         geometry.
         6.8.3.3.1 Gun/Bomb. This is one of the more flexible attacks from low altitude
         because it allows flight lead to find and “mark” the target while you drop bombs to
         destroy it. The attack geometry will be built around the bomb pass since the delivery
         parameters are more restrictive. You should arrive at an action/pop distance that is
         familiar to you from your range rides (Figure 6.11).

Figure 6.11. Low-Altitude Gun/Bomb.
AETCTTP11-1      4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                          119


         6.8.3.3.2 Bomb/Gun. When it’s time for your lead to drop his bombs, you will follow
         him into the target area and kill with the gun or suppress the enemy defenses while he
         egresses. The primary concern on your pass should be effectively employing the gun
         and remaining clear of leads frag cylinder. Remember that the frag cylinder of a basic
         MK-82 is about 3,000 feet in height and diameter. As a general ROT, if you fire by
         1.3 NM slant range (under the gun cross) and start your recovery, you will stay clear
         of the frag (Figure 6.12).

Figure 6.12. Low-Altitude Bomb/Gun.




         6.8.3.3.3 Guns. Remember that the gun is a very flexible weapon that can be shot
         from almost any reasonable distance. A general way to think about your gun shots is
         that if you have a valid solution in the HUD, the bullets will hit where you are
         aiming; how much damage/penetration you get from those bullets depends on slant
         range. Always remember to track – shoot - track. In this attack, notice that the lead
         actions away from wing in Figure 6.13. This allows both jets to be down virtually the
         same run-in heading. This type of attack, where flight lead actions away from wing,
         can be used with any combination of ordnance.
120                                                  AETCTTP11-1         4 SEPTEMBER 2009


Figure 6.13. Low-Altitude Guns.




          6.8.3.3.4 Bombs. Another low-altitude attack is a Shooters - Bombs attack. This
          attack requires some planning due to frag deconfliction. By looking at the frag
          cylinder for the type of weapon you are employing, you can determine whether
          timing or altitude deconfliction would be best. Usually, timing deconfliction offers
          the most mutual support during this attack but requires more work from the wingman.
          Altitude deconfliction minimizes the work of the wingman but can sacrifice mutual
          support prior to expending and during off target maneuvering.
          6.8.3.4 Off-Target Priorities. There are several tasks to accomplish once you have
          pickled. Be sure to prioritize flying the jet first as always.
          6.8.3.4.1 Turning Maneuver Level Turn SEM. Your first priority after weapon
          release is a valid SEM. The mechanics and parameters of these SEMs remain the
          same as the BSA pattern. Realize that the purpose of these maneuvers is to keep you
          safe from the ground, the frag of your own weapon, and to get you away from other
          threat rings in the area as quickly as possible.
          6.8.3.4.2 Clearing Your Six. With threats in the target area, you should keep your jet
          moving and use CMD to decoy IR and radar threats. In all cases, your primary
          defense against AAA is 3D maneuvers. In a low-altitude (high-threat) scenario,
          following your TMLT you will be slightly below pickle altitude, approximately 600
          to 800 feet AGL. With a minimum altitude of 500 feet AGL, you are left with not
          much maneuvering room below you. You must move the jet in three dimensions, but
          realize the biggest threat is the ground. While accomplishing this, you should also
          preemptively CMD to defeat any MANPADS.
          6.8.3.4.3 Find Your Flight Lead. After concentrating on attack geometry, valid
          weapons employment, and your off-target priorities, finding lead turns out to be much
          easier low altitude. Lead will give you a rough idea of where he will be upon
          completion of your off-target maneuvers, but you will be assumed to be blind off
          target. You must call visual as you egress the target area in a good mutually
          supportive formation like wedge or tactical.
AETCTTP11-1       4 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                        121

          6.8.3.4.4 Get Back into Position. Even at low altitude, you can find yourself low on
          energy when trying to get back into wedge on lead. Remember to use geometry/cutoff
          to regain correct distance/AA from number one.

Terms
3/9 Line—An imaginary line extending through the 3 and 9 o’clock positions of an aircraft (also
known as the pitch or lateral axis).
Abort—Directive to cease the action, attack, event, or mission.
Acceleration maneuver—A maneuver flown to increase airspeed. Zero G is optimum.
Admin lead—Used to pass lead responsibilities to another member of the flight. The
administrative (admin) lead is expected to run all aspects of the profile to include navigating,
managing the radios, and making changes to the profile if external conditions dictate (for
example, changing the bingo fuel with a change in the alternate). With an admin lead change, the
call signs within the flight are administratively renumbered to match the position being flown.
Lead still retains ultimate authority for the formation.
Angle-off—The angle formed by the extension of the longitudinal axes of two aircraft; the
difference in headings. Also called the HCA.
Aspect angle—The angle measured from the tail or longitudinal axis of one aircraft to another
aircraft’s position. For example, 0° aspect angle is directly behind and 180° aspect angle is
directly in front. The aspect angle is independent of the other aircraft’s heading.
Bingo—A prebriefed fuel state needed for recovery using prebriefed parameters.
Blind—No visual contact with friendly aircraft; the opposite of “visual.”
Break (Up, Down, Right, or Left)—To perform an immediate maximum performance turn in
the indicated direction. Assumes a defensive situation.

Cleared—Requested action is authorized.
Closure—Overtake created by airspeed advantage and/or angles. The rate at which range
decreases (also known as Vc: closure velocity “V-sub-C”). Closure can be positive (getting
closer) or negative (getting farther away).
Cross turn—A 180° heading reversal by a flight where aircraft turn into each other.
Element lead—The pilot responsible for the conduct of a two-ship element. In a two-ship
formation, the element lead is the flight lead (see definition). Number 3 is the element lead in a
four-ship formation.
Extension or acceleration maneuver—An unloaded maneuver, almost always at a high-power
setting, to gain airspeed and either generate closure (decrease distance) or increase opening
velocity (separation).
FENCE—The boundary separating hostile and friendly areas. Entering or exiting designated
area.
FENCE check—Set cockpit switches as appropriate.
Flight lead—Although perhaps not the most experienced pilot in the flight, the flight lead
(referred to as “lead”) is charged with the safe and successful completion of the mission.
Wingmen may lead portions of the mission, but the designated flight lead does not change.
High six—A position physically above and behind an aircraft regardless of heading or bank
angle.
Joker—Fuel state above bingo at which separation, bug out, or event termination should begin
and proceed with the remainder of the mission.
Knock-it-off—Training term used to stop maneuvers in progress for safety of flight issues.
Lag pursuit—Maneuvering to control closure, range, and/or aspect angle by positioning the lift
vector (or flightpath) toward the outside of another aircraft’s TC. Lag pursuit usually decreases
AA.
Lag reposition—An out-of-plane maneuver performed to control overtake, decrease aspect
angle, and/or prevent an overshoot by using vertical TR above and behind another aircraft’s
POM.
Lead pursuit—Maneuvering to control closure, range, and/or AA by positioning the LV (or
flightpath) toward the inside of another aircraft’s TC. Lead pursuit usually increases or maintains
aspect angle.
Lead reposition—An out-of-plane maneuver generally performed to increase overtake and
aspect angle and/or decrease range by using vertical TR below another aircraft’s POM.
Lift vector—An imaginary plane going vertically through the top of the aircraft, representing the
POM in a straight pull. “Set the lift vector” means to roll the aircraft to set the point you want to
pull to at your 12 o’clock high.
Line abreast—Two groups, contacts, formations, or aircraft side by side.
Line of sight—A direct line between two aircraft.

Line-of-sight rate—Speed of apparent drift of one aircraft in relation to another, speed of
angular change of LOS.
Nav lead—May be used when lead wants the wingman to navigate and clear. Lead will fly the
wingman position, deconflict within the flight, and keep the radios; for example, battle damage
check.
Ops check—Periodic check of aircraft systems performed by the aircrew (including fuel) for
safety of flight.
Overshoot (flightpath)—Results in one aircraft crossing through or behind the flightpath of the
other aircraft, but not necessarily in front of the other aircraft’s 3/9 line.
Overshoot (3/9 line)—Results in the aft aircraft flushing forward of the other aircraft’s 3/9 line.
Perch—A position behind and to the side of an aircraft used to define a starting point for follow-
on maneuvering.
Plane of motion—A plane extending from the flightpath of an aircraft to the center of its turn
radius.
Pure pursuit—An aircraft with its nose pointing at another aircraft is in “pure pursuit.”
Push—Change frequency without acknowledgment.
Quarter plane—A last-ditch maneuver used to prevent a 3/9 overshoot or to “preserve 3/9 line”
at closer ranges and higher LOS rates.
Radial G—The vector sum of the aircraft's LV and gravity when turning in a vertical POM; that
is, the G effectively turning the aircraft.
Squawk—Operate IFF as indicated or IFF is operating as indicated.
Tactical lead—May be used when lead needs the wingman to lead an event (for example,
extended trail) or a segment of the flight. In this case, the wingman will pick up tactical,
navigation, and radio responsibilities but not the overall flight lead responsibility. Individual call
signs do not change.
Terminate—Training term used to stop maneuvers in progress for nonsafety of flight issues.
Turn circle—The flightpath described by an aircraft in a turn.
Turn radius—The distance between an aircraft’s flightpath and the center of the TC.
Turn rate—Degrees per second an aircraft turns.
Turning room—Volume of airspace in the vertical, horizontal, or both, which can be used to
execute a desired maneuver.
Visual—Sighting of a friendly aircraft or ground position; the opposite of “blind.”
Zipper—A double-click of the microphone button used to attract the attention of another pilot in
the formation without compromising mission information (for example, call signs or flight
composition) or cluttering the frequency.
