and AFI 31-218, Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision.
2.8.1. (Added) . Hearing guidance:
2.8.1.1. (Added) . In accordance with Air Force Occupational Safety and Health Standard 48-
20, Occupational Noise and Hearing Conservation Program, personnel working in or entering
designated "hazardous noise areas" will always carry Hearing Protection Devices (HPD). When
noise sources are operating, personnel will wear their HPD regardless of exposure time. There is
significant potential for hazardous noise exposure while on the flight line from aerospace ground
equipment, operating aircraft and power tools. Therefore, the flight line is a designated
hazardous noise area. The following policy is established to clarify requirements for hearing
protection while on the flight line:
2.8.1.1.1. (Added) . No hearing protection is required when driving on the flight line in a fully
enclosed vehicle unless the vehicle has been identified as a hazardous noise producer at the
operator’s position.
2.8.1.1.2. (Added) . When working outside on the flight line and noise sources are operating,
approved double hearing protection is required. This includes either approved ear plugs, other
fitted plugs, or approved ear muffs (an official listing can be obtained at the 673D Bio-
Environmental Squadron). Hearing protection devices must be approved by Bioenvironmental
Engineering. Refer to your Work center Bioenvironmental Engineering survey for required
Noise Reduction Ratings (NRR).
2.8.1.1.3. (Added) . When working within 100 feet of running aircraft, dual hearing protection
is required. Dual hearing protection is also required for workers who are within 300 feet of an
aircraft that is landing or taking off. Dual hearing protection consists of a combination of both
plugs and muffs, or plugs and an approved communication headset.
2.8.1.1.4. (Added) . When working within 30 feet of running Aerospace Ground Equipment,
dual hearing protection is required. Hearing protection devices must be approved by
Bioenvironmental Engineering. Refer to your Work center Bioenvironmental Engineering
survey for required Noise Reduction Ratings (NRR).
2.8.1.2. (Added) . Proper use of appropriate hearing protection is a critical link in preventing
hearing loss and ensuring mission success. All Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER)
personnel will comply with protection guidelines outlined above when they are on the flight line.
2.8.1.3. (Added) . Questions concerning flight line hearing protection requirements should be
directed to Bioenvironmental Engineering (673 AMDS/SGPB) at 552-3985.
2.9.2. (Added) . Government vehicles and Support Equipment will have parking brakes set or
chocks in place to prevent inadvertent movement while parked on the flight line and in
maintenance facilities.
2.20. (Added) . Radio Frequency Radiation Protection Program:
2.20.1. (Added) . Each squadron or Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) with Radio Frequency
(RF) emitting equipment will appoint a Radiation Safety Officer (RSO). This title does not
denote a commissioned status or job classification. Identify the RSO to Bioenvironmental
Engineering Flight (BEF), 3 AMDS/SGPB, in writing.

2.20.2. (Added) . The RSO will:
2.20.2.1. (Added) . Ensure all personnel working on or with RF-emitting equipment are
properly trained in RF safety practices and follow strict adherence to technical data. The training
will occur initially, when procedures change and then annually as refresher training. Document
the training on AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record.
2.20.2.2. (Added) . Act as a point of contact for all RF safety matters, maintain active liaison
with BEF personnel and assist them in incident investigations.
2.20.2.3. (Added) . Mark and control access to all areas where potentially hazardous RF
radiation levels may occur.
2.20.2.4. (Added) . Ensure WARNING signs conforming to AFOSH STD 48-9, Electro-
Magnetic Frequency/Radiation Occupational Health Program, are procured, maintained, and
available (See Attachment 28, this supplement).
2.20.3. (Added) . General. A possible RF radiation hazard exists whenever particular system
or test equipment is operated on the flight line or within a hangar. Certain aircraft systems have
ground safety interlocks that prevent them from transmitting RF on the ground; therefore, posing
no RF hazard under normal operating conditions. Such systems require no special safety
precautions unless it’s necessary to override the safety interlocks for system checkouts. Several
attachments are included with this instruction to highlight specific aircraft hazards and potential
hazardous areas as follows:
2.20.3.1. (Added) . Attachment 29, this supplement, lists RF-emitting aircraft systems and test
equipment in operation on the Elmendorf flight line.

engines at twice the normal flying rate until the engine/modules/accessories are, at a minimum,
two years ahead of the top 10% (high time) fleet engines. The CV engines/modules/accessories
are then to continue leading the fleet by two years. CV engines/modules/accessories will be
maintained in accordance with maintenance instructions and inspection criteria given in
appropriate Technical Orders Data (TOD), unless otherwise waived, in writing, by the program
committee.
5.12.4.10.3.1. (Added) . The phrase “twice the normal flying rate” is defined as flying CV LTF
engines twice as often while mirroring the mission profile of the passive fleet. For reporting

schedule and any other additional deicing requirements that are not reflected on the daily flying
schedule.
14.44.1.2. (Added) . Deicing operations occurring after 15 April and prior to 15 October:
14.44.1.2.1. (Added-TA and 3 WG AMUs) . AGE does not provide personnel support of
deicing operations during this time. The respective units will accomplish all deicing and
required maintenance of deicer trucks.
14.44.1.2.2. (Added-732 AMS) . The 732 AMS is responsible for providing all personnel for
deicing during this period. 732 AMS is not required to maintain deicer trucks. However, 732
AMS is required to perform basic servicing of their assigned deice trucks during this time.
14.44.2. (Added) . Deicing Procedures:
14.44.2.1. (Added) . When the deicer truck driver arrives at the aircraft, he/she will contact the
deicing supervisor (provided by requesting unit, either 3 MXG units or 732 AMS). The deicing
supervisor will brief deice procedures, safety, and route of travel to the vehicle driver, basket
operator, and spotter(s) before initiating deicing operations.
14.44.2.2. (Added) . The driver, deicing basket operator, and spotter will operate as a team.
Regardless of the direction of vehicle travel (forward or backing); deicer drivers will remain in
constant communication with the deicing basket operator. The vehicle operator will not
reposition the deicer truck unless the truck movement is continuously monitored and directed by
deicing basket operator and the ground spotter (chock walker) using headsets, radio, and hand
signals.

14.44.2.3. (Added) . All units conducting deicing operations are required to track vehicle reg
number, aircraft tail number, and fluid usage, anytime 3 MXS AGE does not provide the driver
This information will be relayed to the 3 MXS AGE Deicing Section for maintenance and fluid
tracking. CAUTION: In accordance with AFJMAN 24-306, "Do not drive vehicles within 10
feet of a parked aircraft, except when the aircraft is being serviced, loaded, or off-loaded". Do
not back or drive vehicles forward directly toward any aircraft, except as authorized in certain
loading, unloading, or fueling operations. In these cases, place pre-positioned chocks between
the aircraft and the approaching vehicle to keep vehicles from striking the aircraft".

    RADIO FREQUENCY RADIATION PROTECTION PROGRAM PROCEDURES

A35.1. Procedures Maintenance Personnel will notify the AMU production superintendent that
maintenance on an RF-emitting system will take place and access to the aircraft will be limited to
essential personnel only. Prior to hot transmitting radar, AMUs will notify Maintenance
Operation Center (MOC) of the location and time of the hot transmit session. Then MOC will
make a broadcast on all maintenance nets, notify Security Forces, Wing Safety, Munitions
Control and Airfield Management/Base Operations.
A35.2. Prior to transmitting, obtain marked radio frequency hazard warning signs or cones and
place them around the hazard area of the aircraft.
A35.3. For fighter aircraft, a minimum of two people are required for operation of RF-emitting
systems and test equipment to help prevent violation of cone barriers. Communication will be
established between personnel on the ground and in the cockpit prior to system operation. This
will allow ground personnel to notify the operator if a hazardous situation occurs. To transmit
hot radar, at least one of the technicians must be a 7-level. The aircraft will be parked on the
elbow spot 4 (closest to the end of runway (EOR) shack facing the 05 end of the runway. This
will only occur during non-fly hours. If this spot is not available, Maintenance Group Quality
Assurance and airfield management must approve an alternate location. After the aircraft is safe
for maintenance for weight off wheel application, ensure only the circuit breakers for radar
operations are reset. While transmitting radar, a safety observer will warn the radar operator if
personnel or vehicles approach the hazard area. The radar operator will immediately place radar
in standby mode until area is clear.
A35.4. For E-3 and C-17 aircraft operating weather radar, a safety observer will be positioned in
the flight deck with the radar operator. The safety observer will warn the radar operator if
personnel or vehicles approach the hazard area. The radar operator will immediately place
weather radar in STANDBY mode until area is clear. See paragraph A35.5 below when
performing an E-3 surveillance radar live fire.
A35.5. Procedures for ground operation of E-3 surveillance radar (Live-Fire).          See Local
Checklist LCL-3W/1E-3A-43-2-93-3-20
A35.6. Procedures for overexposure or possible overexposure to RF radiation:
A35.7. Maintenance will cease immediately and the individual will report to their shift
supervisor or production superintendent. The supervisor will ensure the person is taken without
delay to the hospital emergency room for evaluation and/or treatment.
A35.8. The supervisor/production superintendent will notify MOC, commander, maintenance
supervision, RSO, and the BEF.
A35.9. The RSO will “FREEZE THE SCENE” to allow BEF personnel to best reconstruct the
incident and determine the actual exposure level to the individual.
A35.10. FREEZE THE SCENE is defined as the halting of actions within the vicinity of the
incident, any items/equipment will be left in its original state unless directly impeding the
mission.

A35.11. Refer to AFOSH Standard 48-9 for details on medical investigations and effects of RF
on the human body.
A35.12. For questions concerning RF radiation safety or in case of an actual emergency, call
BEF, 673rd Medical Group, or your squadron RSO.

                                 HOT BRAKES PROCEDURES

A40.1. Procedures:
A40.1.1. There are no mechanical means to determine if an aircraft has hot brakes (TO 4B-1-1,
Use of Landing Wheel Brakes and Wheels During Ground Operations) therefore hot brakes can
only be declared by the aircraft commander (AC) or Crash Recovery personnel. Once an
emergency has been declared, the IC is responsible for directing and coordinating all recovery
actions. Upon notification of suspected hot brakes:
A40.1.1.1. If the aircraft is on rollout, the tower will direct the aircraft to taxi to the nearest hot
brake area in accordance with 3WGI 13-204. If the aircraft is already at EOR, the aircraft will
remain in position and personnel will evacuate the area.
A40.1.1.2. If hot brakes are suspected, the brakes will not be checked until 10 minutes have
passed since the last application of brakes due to heat transfer from the brakes to the wheel
assemblies.
A40.1.1.3. Fire department or Crash Recovery personnel will chock the aircraft. Personnel will
approach an aircraft with suspected hot brakes from a forward or aft direction. Crash Recovery
personnel will check the aircraft brakes for excessive heat after the 10 minute wait period for
heat buildup has passed and determines if brakes are hot. Fighter aircraft engines will not be
shut down unless directed by the IC or determined as necessary by aircrew due to critical
systems failures/emergencies.
A40.1.1.4. If the AC or Crash Recovery personnel declare hot brakes, the aircraft will remain in
the designated area for 30 minutes to allow adequate cool-down time in accordance with TO 4B-
1-1, Use of Landing Wheel Brakes and Wheels During Ground Operations. All personnel will
stay clear of an area extending 300 feet in a 45 degree angle on both sides of the wheel until the
brakes have cooled or the thermal release plugs have deflated the tires.
A40.1.1.5. The Senior Fire Officer IC on scene will direct a fire vehicle to remain with the
aircraft for the allotted cool-down time.
A40.1.1.6. Aircraft may taxi back to the designated parking area after the allotted cool-down
time.
A40.2. Host unit C-17, E-3, C-130, F-22 and C-12 personnel will tow their aircraft to the
designated parking spot after the allotted cool-down period if engines are shut down. Heavy
aircraft may shut down for evacuation purposes. The 732nd AMS is responsible for towing all
AMC aircraft back to the designated parking spots.
A40.3. The crash recovery team will tow all other aircraft back to its designated parking spot if
engines are shut down after the allotted cool-down period.

A41.1. The Maintenance Group Commander (MXG/CC) will ensure compliance and all section
supervisors will brief the following tow procedures.
A41.2. All MDS General procedures (NOTE: Extra precautions must be exercised whenever
extreme weather conditions exist. Base Operations is the central point for gathering current
weather conditions and snow control information.):
A41.2.1. Production Superintendent will declare the event as “Elevated Risk” tow when any of
the following conditions are met:
A41.2.2. Presence of unplowed snow.
A41.2.3. Presence of ice or compacted snow that has NOT been sanded.
A41.2.4. Tows during high wind on wet pavement.
A41.2.5. Unit Supervision will be notified of “Elevated Risk” before commencing tow based on
weather, ramp conditions, snow removal, and sanding progress, if required.
A41.2.6. Production Superintendent must be directly involved in the risk assessment, ORM, and
Tow Team briefing when “Elevated Risk” tow conditions are declared.
A41.2.7. The decision to proceed with the tow will be made by the Production Superintendent’s
authority and will be based on basic ORM principles.
A41.2.8. ALL tow team members will have the opportunity to call “KNOCK-IT-OFF” at any
time during the tow procedures in the interest of personnel and aircraft safety.
A41.3. All MDS Pre-Tow Safety Briefing:
A41.3.1. Tow Team Supervisor will brief all members on individual duties and responsibilities
in accordance with applicable tech data (that is, wing / tail / chock walkers, tow vehicle operator
and brake operators).
A41.3.2. Tow Team Supervisor will brief the rate of speed, the route of travel, and any known
obstacles or critical movement areas that will be encountered during the tow (i.e. hangar
entry/exit).
A41.3.3. Tow Team Supervisor will emphasize the importance of early detection of aircraft
skidding/sliding to ALL team members.
A41.3.4. Tow Team Supervisor will brief all members on authorized signals including hand
signals, whistles/air horns and wands. Special verbal commands (that is, “SLIDING,”
“BRAKES, BRAKES, BRAKES,” “STOP”) will be defined and corresponding team actions
identified.
A41.3.5. Tow Team Supervisor will brief all members on required ground communications for
clearance-to-proceed and control tower notification procedures.
A41.3.6. Tow Team Supervisor will brief all members on the following specific emergency
procedures:
AFI21-101_3WGSUP 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                                119


A41.3.6.1. In the event of the tow vehicle and aircraft separating during a tow, the tow driver
will accelerate to clear the area. If breakaway occurs when pushing the aircraft back, the Tow
Supervisor will determine the best course of action that may include stopping, steering clear, or
accelerating out of dangers way. The aircraft brake operator will apply brakes when commanded
by the Supervisor with the word “BRAKES.”
A41.3.6.2. In the event of the aircraft sliding/skidding during a tow, the driver should make all
efforts to remain in front of the aircraft. During a slide while pushing back on an aircraft, the
Tow Supervisor will determine the best action to take depending on the situation; this may
include aircraft brakes, tow vehicle brakes, or tow vehicle acceleration.
A41.3.6.3. In the event of impending impact, the Tow Supervisor will command the vehicle
driver to apply brakes with the word “STOP” or use the whistle.
A41.4. F-22A Inclement Weather/Limited Visibility Tow Procedures:

stop and in all the critical areas as conditions warrant. Critical Areas (identified below in
paragraphs A14.5.4.1 through A14.5.4.4) with ice will be heavily sanded as determined
sufficient by the Production Superintendent and Tow Supervisor, before beginning tow.
A41.5.2. All tow personnel will be familiar with the tail-heavy nature of the C-17 design.
Aircraft CG can be further aggravated by cargo configuration and excessive snow build-up on T-
tail which can lead to nose wheels loosing traction during low traction, off camber maneuvers.
A41.5.3. Tow Vehicle operators must complete the unit-developed training plan and
successfully perform a certification tow in winter conditions (ice and snow present and chains on
tow vehicle) before performing Tow Vehicle Driver duties in Elevated Risk situations.
A41.5.4. Supervisors responsible for towing will be aware of the local critical movement areas
that have resulted in aircraft sliding. See below.
