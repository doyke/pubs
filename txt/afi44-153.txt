                                            Chapter 1

                                   PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose. Most individuals respond to challenging life events without significant negative
consequences. Nonetheless, while in garrison and in traditional battle roles, Airmen may
encounter several types of incidents putting them at risk for the full spectrum of stress reactions
ranging from minor stress reactions to more severe symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.
Disaster Mental Health (DMH) and Combat and Operational Stress Control (COSC) are two
methods to proactively respond to these incidents and minimize the likelihood of longstanding or
debilitating stress reactions.
     1.1.1. Disaster Mental Health (DMH) is the coordinated response typically at permanent in-
     garrison locations, initiated by unit leaders in which the DMH team provides psychological
     first aid to individuals and groups who may have or who have had direct exposure to an all-
     hazard incident. An all-hazard incident is any incident, natural or manmade, serious enough
     to warrant action to protect the life, property, health, and safety of military members,
     dependents, and civilians at risk, and minimize any disruptions of installation operations.
     1.1.2. COSC utilizes many of the same psychological first aid principles as does DMH but
     addresses prevention and management of battle related stress before, during, and after
     deployment. The various presentations of combat related stress are termed Combat and
     Operational Stress Reactions (COSR) and when they occur are typically normal and/or an
     expected reaction to battle. In their milder and more common forms, COSRs do not
     represent diagnosable mental health conditions.
1.2. While the majority of individuals who are exposed to an all-hazard incident or battle
most will not experience long-term adverse effects, though all have the potential to
experience stress reactions. If stress reactions are noted following an all-hazard event or battle,
most reactions are typically mild and of short duration. DMH and COSC preventive services can
mitigate these symptoms and help prevent potential long term problems such as Posttraumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD).

                              DISASTER MENTAL HEALTH

2.1. Purpose.
   2.1.1. DMH Teams foster resilience in those who are, or may be exposed to all-hazard
   incidents or operational stress environments. This is accomplished through preparatory
   education for those likely to experience significant, or high stress events/experiences and
   stressors, through ongoing education, intervention, screening, psychological first aid, and
   referrals as needed for those exposed.
   2.1.2. Other requests for consultation. Commanders and other leaders may approach the
   DMH team chief or team members for consultation and advice for many matters outside the
   scope of an all-hazards incident, i.e. for losses such as a death of a unit member away from
   the workplace. Although not DMH, this response may include members of the DMH team
   (e.g. the RST for grief issues and memorial services). See AFI 44-172, for requirements
   when consultations or when contacts become clinical in nature.
2.2. Roles and Responsibilities.

   after an all-hazard incident. (T-0)
   2.3.3. Coordinates efforts with the Public Health Emergency Officer and integrates efforts of
   the DMH team into the overall public health emergency preparedness and response. (T-0)
2.4. DMH Team.
   2.4.1. DMH team membership is multidisciplinary and will include at a minimum:
      2.4.1.1. A licensed Mental Health provider serves as the DMH team chief.
      2.4.1.2. Mental health personnel (Psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, mental
      health nurses, MH technicians and/or a licensed provider who is trained in acute mental
      health intervention). (T-0)
      2.4.1.3. Religious Support Team (RST). (Chaplain and chaplain assistant).
      2.4.1.4. Airman and Family Readiness Center (AFRC). Community Readiness
      Consultant (CRC). (T-0)
      2.4.1.5. Alternate members for each role. Alternates’ training requirements to be
      determined IAW paragraph 2.2.5.6.1. If qualified ARC and ANG personnel are
      available, DMH team chief should consider their membership when forming DMH teams
      on active duty installations. (T-0)
      2.4.1.6. Representatives from certain career fields involved in all-hazards responses (e.g.
      Security Forces, Civil Engineers) may also serve as either permanent or ad hoc DMH
      members at the discretion of the DMH chief and proposed member’s leadership IAW
      DoDI 6490.05 and DoDI 6200.03. (T-0)
2.5. DMH Services.
   2.5.1. All individuals directly involved in all-hazard incident or combat and operational
   stress should be provided the opportunity to access DMH services IAW DoDI 6490.05 and
   DoDI 6200.03. (T-0)
   2.5.2. Participation in interventions is voluntary, though unit leaders may arrange for
   affected personnel to receive education.
   2.5.3. DMH services may include Pre-Exposure Preparation, education, screening and
   referral. Medical or mental health record documentation is not required for DMH team
   services, since they are not medical services. However, after action reports for
   intervention/education with groups (date, squadron, number in attendance, incident/training)
   should be annotated for continuity in DMH binder IAW DoDI 6200.03.
   2.5.4. Following an all-hazard incident, individuals can seek up to four one-on-one meetings
   with any member of the DMH team IAW DoDI 6200.03. Should non-beneficiaries seek
   educational visits with the team’s mental health providers, they should be referred to the
   resources of their specific employee assistance program or applicable medical plan. (T-0)
      2.5.4.1. One-on-one meetings are for the purpose of education and consultation, not for
      medical assessment or treatment. Since interventions are educational and focused on the
      incident they are not documented. If an individual begins to discuss topics outside the
 8                                                                       AFI44-153 29 MAY 2014


        incident they need to be reminded of the guidelines of DMH and their options for formal
        treatment (e.g. installation Mental Health Clinic).
     2.5.5. Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status members exposed to potentially traumatic
     experiences in battle or as a result of an all-hazards incident are entitled to DMH services.
     As long as those services are psycho-educational, there is no need for reporting it as a clinical
     visit. However, if services elevate to treatment, the provider will need to comply with DoDI
     5210.42-R, Nuclear Weapon Personnel Reliability Program, AFMAN 10-3902 and any local
     guidance on PRP. Regardless of whether DMH services are psycho-educational or treatment,
     any Potentially Disqualifying Information (PDI) discovered must be passed to the CMA as
     soon as possible. It is also prudent to remind any PRP members receiving DMH services that
     they have a duty to notify their supervisor or certifying official of any factors that could have
     an adverse impact on their performance, reliability, or safety while performing PRP duties.
     (T-0)
        2.5.5.1. Prior to sessions, members will be informed that regulations requiring
        notification of Potentially Disqualifying Information or risk still apply, especially for
        individuals on PRP, with security clearances, on flying status or other special duties. (T-
        0)
     2.5.6. For Mental Health providers such as operational psychologists or “embedded” mental
     health providers who may serve in dual or multiple relationship roles (DMH Lead, consultant
     to command, treatment provider) may exist, explanation of the role of DMH during all-
     hazard incident responses will help clarify responsibilities and eliminate confusion.
        2.5.6.1. DMH as an educational/consultative intervention is not formal mental health
        treatment. This difference must be communicated to DMH recipients and leadership
        when responding to all-hazards incidents. In the course of DMH education, if an
        individual needs to be directed to mental health treatment, MH providers will follow AF
        guidance for quality and documentation IAW AFI 44-119, Medical Quality Operations
        and AFI 44-172.
2.6. Other Consultative Roles.
     2.6.1. Air or Ground Incidents That Involve Loss of Life or Major Injury. The DMH team
     leader is a consultant to the on-scene commander and assists in determining whether there is
     a need for DMH support. If the commander requests service, the scope of those services
     should be outlined by the commander in consultation with the DMH team leader IAW DoDI
     6200.03 and DoDI 6490.05.
     2.6.2. Hostage Negotiation Consultation. Members of the DMH team may serve in a
     consultation role to the on-scene commander, Security Forces hostage negotiation team or
     civilian counterparts consistent with their level of training. Unless the DMH team member
     has specific training in hostage negotiation, their role will be limited to consultation on DMH
     or other mental health issues consistent with their training. (T-0)
     2.6.3. Search and Rescue Activities. Individuals participating in search and rescue activities,
     including professional personnel (e.g., forensic pathologists and mortuary personnel) should
     have the opportunity to receive DMH services IAW DoDI 6200.03 and DoDI 6490.05.
AFI44-153 29 MAY 2014                                                                         9


   2.6.4. Services provided will vary depending on the nature of the incident and the needs of
   the personnel involved. (T-0)
2.7. DMH Team Training.
   2.7.1. Minimum training topics include: prevention, outreach, screening, triage,
   psychological first aid, education and referral services for individuals and groups, command
   consultation, ethical issues, needs assessments and surveillance, burnout and secondary
   trauma.
   2.7.2. All team members, regardless of duty location or length of tenure on the team, will
   train at least quarterly and train and exercise as a team.
   2.7.3. Training is focused on preparation of the team to respond to realistic all-hazards
   incidents that could activate DMH.
2.8. Pre-Exposure Preparation (PEP).
   2.8.1. DMH Teams are available to provide preventive, Pre-Exposure Preparation (PEP) to
   individuals, units and communities who expect to encounter All-Hazard Incidents. (T-0)
   2.8.2. PEP’s purpose is to build resilience and skills to understand and minimize typical
   stress reactions under abnormal circumstances. The DMH team chief should cooperatively
   plan PEP training with leaders of units expecting battle exposure or exposure to all-hazards
   incidents when both agree the training is warranted. PEP training should be tailored to
   specific unit requirements and expected exposures and should not duplicate existing training.
   Mental Health providers can access additional PEP resources at the following Readiness
   Skills Verification site (https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx7/MentalHealthRSVP/Pages/training-
   resources.aspx). (T-0)

                                           Chapter 3

              COMBAT AND OPERATIONAL STRESS CONTROL (COSC).

3.1. Purpose. Where PEP and DMH seek to prevent or minimize responses to stressors prior to
any type of potentially traumatic exposure such as an all-hazards incident, COSC seeks to
prevent and manage stress reactions through increased psychological resilience and skill building
both prior to and after exposure in a wartime environment.
3.2. COSC Principles.
   3.2.1. In a deployed setting, the COSC can operate in different capacities or under different
   leadership (e.g., when local OPCON is an Army or Navy function). MH providers may work
   in a COSC clinic or a MH clinic that has a COSC Team supporting the installation or region
   where potentially traumatic incidents occur. No matter the setting, the principles for
   psychological interventions for the prevention of combat and operational stress reactions are
   the same: support of our first-responders and those impacted by combat or operational stress.
   3.2.2. COSC, in concert with other prevention efforts, intervenes to mitigate the risk of
   potential longer-term physical and psychological consequences of combat and other military
   operations.
   3.2.3. COSC or a similar low stigma term shall be used to reduce the risk that these services
   are confused with clinical treatment or traditional mental health care. (T-0)
3.3. Roles.
   3.3.1. Commanders of the Combatant Commands. Designates a Mental Health professional
   as the COSC consultant to each Command Surgeon and Combatant Commander as needed.
   3.3.2. Mental Health Personnel. Will provide COSC services and complete training
   standards IAW DoDI 6490.05 (encl 2. c. and g.). (T-0)
   3.3.3. Non-Mental Health Medical Personnel. Will be familiar with the general principles of
   COSC management, and will be trained on the identification of stress related conditions,
   psychological first aid and the management of COSR. (T-0)
   3.3.4. RSTs. Similar to their role in DMH, RSTs are a core component when supporting
   COSC in responding to a traumatic event in the deployed setting. In addition to their
   religious/spiritual roles in the battle environment, their training will also include familiarity
   with the general principles of COSC management, the identification of stress related
   conditions, psychological first aid and the management of COSR. (T-0)
   3.3.5. Leadership. Commissioned and Noncommissioned Officers alike will complete
   training in the identification of COSR in themselves and others, psychological first aid,
   resilience and importance of consulting with COSC personnel for support, referral resources
   and when to utilize them. (T-0)
   3.3.6. Line Personnel. Will complete training in COSR, resilience, psychological first aid
   and referral resources and when to utilize them. (T-0)
AFI44-153 29 MAY 2014                                                                            11


3.4. COSC Program.
   3.4.1. COSC programs seek to prevent or minimize adverse effects of COSR through
   primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention efforts, to include:
      3.4.1.1. COSC Personnel consult with line commanders regarding surveillance and
      prevention, identification, and management of COSR in units and individuals before,
      during and after deployments. (T-0)
      3.4.1.2. COSC Personnel will be familiar with and use Module A2 from the Department
      of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG)
      for the Management of Post-Traumatic Stress to manage COSR (see
      http://www.healthquality.va.gov/ptsd/). (T-0)
      3.4.1.3. COSC Personnel will complete assessments and interventions regarding the
      effects of potentially traumatic events in squadrons as requested by commanders or
      recommended by providers as trends are noticed within units. (T-0)
   3.4.2. COSC personnel will record numbers of incidents and individuals with COSR
   separately; checking with servicing department for the format currently established (e.g.,
   COSC Workload and Activity Reporting System (WARS)). Absent any other guidance,
   tracking and monitoring is to be completed IAW DoDI 6490.05. (T-0)
3.5. COSC Training Requirements.
   3.5.1. All AF Personnel will complete required pre-deployment training IAW DoDI 6490.05
   and AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution. (T-0)
      3.5.1.1. All MH Personnel will complete required pre-deployment training and
      subsequent COSC training topics outlined in DoDI 6490.05. (T-0)
   3.5.2. It is the responsibility of the Wing/installation commander to assure the pre and post
   deployment training of deploying personnel and with the assistance of subordinate
   installation resources (e.g. Community Action Information Board/Integrated Delivery
   System) to ensure that COSC principles are supported across the deployment cycle. (T-0)
   3.5.3. Airman Pre-/post-Deployment Training (APPDT) is a standardized and mandatory set
   of briefings developed by AFMSA/SG3OQ for both pre- and post-deployment IAW AFI 10-
   403, Chapter 8 and DoDI 6490.05, Maintenance of Psychological Health and Contingency
   Operations Maintenance of Psychological Health in Military Operations. For units that
   deploy frequently and for shorter durations, AFI 10-403 allows exceptions based on these
   factors. (T-0)
   3.5.4. For the highest risk career fields with regular exposure to life threatening situations or
   casualties, individuals may have the opportunity to attend a Deployment Transition Center to
   facilitate reintegration and long term resilience. AF/A1S is the point of contact regarding the
   DTC. Local units may also request a tailored reintegration program through local support
   agencies IAW DoDI 6490.05. (T-0)
 12                                                               AFI44-153 29 MAY 2014


                                         Chapter 4

                                    REDEPLOYMENT

4.1. Redeployment. Mental Health staff in collaboration with CAIB/IDS agencies will provide
reintegration education and support to redeployed members, families and units IAW AFI 10-403.

TRAINING OUTLINE FOR DISASTER MENTAL HEALTH (DMH) TEAM MEMBERS

A2.1. The content listed below is not an all-inclusive list of all training topics, and/or resources,
but offered as a team resource. Team members are encouraged to review the Field Manual for
Mental Health and Human Services Workers in Major Disaster, the Post Deployment Guides for
Emergency and Disaster Response Workers and Supervisors of Deployed Personnel, Mental
Health and Mass Violence Evidence-Based Early Psychological Intervention for
Victims/Survivors of Mass Violence and the Army Field Manual Combat and Operational Stress
Control (listed in references).
A2.2. DMH team chiefs are responsible for ensuring team members train on the following
topics: Pre-Exposure Preparation, Ethnic and Cultural Issues, Screening and Triage of
Individuals, Principles of Early Interventions/Psychological First Aid, Referral in response to all-
hazard incident, Vicarious Trauma (Taking Care of the Care-Takers), Management of COSRs.
All DMH training components listed must be accomplished annually. To ensure that all areas
are covered; training should occur and be documented at least quarterly.
A2.3. PRE-EXPOSURE PREPARATION.
   A2.3.1. PEP education is the primary preventive function of DMH teams. Community
   education regarding the functions of the DMH teams and PEP should be accomplished on a
   regular basis through briefings and articles in base publications. Education regarding the
   services of the DMH teams should not wait until a response is anticipated or needed. PEP
   training should be offered to all individuals for whom exposure to an all-hazard incident is
   anticipated and should cover at a minimum stress and stress reactions, methods of coping
   with stress and how to avoid ineffective coping.
A2.4. ETHNIC AND CULTURAL ISSUES.
   A2.4.1. Training for DMH/COSC team members in ethnic and cultural competence
   facilitates awareness and improves the effectiveness of response whether at home station or
   deployed. The death of a loved one, community trauma and mass victimization are
   interwoven with cultural overlays. Understanding customs, traditions, rituals, family
   structure, gender roles, and social bonds assist the team members with designing an effective
   response to an all-hazards incident.
A2.5. SCREENING AND TRIAGE OF INDIVIDUALS.
   A2.5.1. Assessment checklists can assist in the identification and documentation of needs in
   those exposed. One such checklist is the Screening and Assessment Checklist from the
   Mental Health Response to Mass Violence and Terrorism, Chapter II (in References).
       A2.5.1.1. Trauma and loss exposure.
       A2.5.1.2. Presence of risk and resiliency factors.
       A2.5.1.3. Current psychological distress.
       A2.5.1.4. Prior coping with major stressors.
       A2.5.1.5. Availability of social support.
AFI44-153 29 MAY 2014                                                                        17


     A2.5.1.6. Current pressing concerns.
  A2.5.2. The flow charts in attachment 3 provide an overview of the Department of Veterans
  Affairs/ Department of Defense (VA/DoD) Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on
  Management of Traumatic Stress. DMH team members can use this CPG to screen and refer
  individuals who have been exposed to an all-hazard incident. The first flow chart depicts a
  core module that can be used to screen any individual who has been exposed to a potentially
  traumatic event. The remaining charts provide guidance on management of individuals with
  acute stress reactions, combat and operational stress reactions, and those who are referred to
  primary care or MH for further assessment.
  A2.5.3. Medical and MH providers are encouraged to review the entire VA/DoD CPG for
  the Management of Post-Traumatic Stress (see References in Attachment 1).
A2.6. PRINCIPLES OF EARLY INTERVENTIONS/PSYCHOLOGICAL FIRST AID.
  A2.6.1. Early intervention policies should be based on empirically defensible and evidence-
  based practices. As mental health staff and COSC members you have an ethical duty to
  discourage team members and Airman from using of ineffective or unsafe techniques, i.e.,
  excessive alcohol use, blaming, breakdown in communication and risk taking behaviors.
  A2.6.2. Basic Needs.
     A2.6.2.1. The DMH Team in consultation with commands must recognize and
     prioritizethe individual’s needs after traumatic events to include: survival, safety,
     security, food, shelter, health (physical and mental health, triage for emergency care) and
     communication (family, friends etc.). Exposed individuals will need information about
     available services which will vary depending on environment and location.
  A2.6.3. Elements of Psychological First Aid.
     A2.6.3.1. Protect individuals from further harm.
     A2.6.3.2. Reduce physiological arousal.
     A2.6.3.3. Provide support for those in acute distress.
     A2.6.3.4. Keep support systems together and facilitate reunions.
     A2.6.3.5. Keep communication open and consistent across the continuum of care.
  A2.6.4. Assessment and Surveillance of Population Needs.
     A2.6.4.1. Assessment and surveillance in an all-hazards incident or during military
     operations identifies the current needs of individuals, groups, a population and/or
     institution or system. The assessment is not a clinical screening. Once enough
     information is gathered, trends and needed resources can be determined to support the
     broader population. If there is enough information to indicate a need in a specific unit,
     the team leader should take these services to them through command consultation.
     A2.6.4.2. If a disaster response is prolonged, long term efforts will include ongoing
     surveillance and reassessment of population needs, the effectiveness of the programs,
     services and supports implemented.
  A2.6.5. Resilience and Recovery.
18                                                                   AFI44-153 29 MAY 2014


     A2.6.5.1. Individuals generally rely on and effectively utilize the resilience skills they
     bring to the ‘fight’. These same skills are the ones they will most effectively utilize to
     respond to operational stress and all hazards incidents. The DMH team promotes existing
     skills and also teaches new skills when possible to increase overall resilience in the face
     of stressors.
  A2.6.6. Command Consultation and Education.
     A2.6.6.1. DMH/COSC team members are consultants providing education on responses
     to battle or other all hazards incidents for commanders and other leaders, first responders
     and other exposed individuals appropriate to each role.
  A2.6.7. Tenets for Consultation and Education.
     A2.6.7.1. Consultation and education is an ongoing process and occurs whether in-
     garrison or deployed. Consultation may be provided at a specific request of command, at
     the recommendation of the DMH Team Leader, or by mutual arrangement, and the topic
     of consultation can center on a unit member, the leader or the unit.
     A2.6.7.2. The consultative process is improved when the consultant reaches out in active
     outreach to commanders. It is best conducted face-to-face; building the relationship prior
     to a specific need being identified.
     A2.6.7.3. Successful consultation depends on gaining trust and credibility when the
     consultant displays knowledge of services/organizations and good military bearing and an
     interest in the wellbeing of the organization.
     A2.6.7.4. Sample 6-step consultation process.
         A2.6.7.4.1. Making the introduction.
         A2.6.7.4.2. Asking commander’s goals/needs: assess/formulate ways to address
         them.
         A2.6.7.4.3. Presenting a plan of action: include goals and alternative actions.
         A2.6.7.4.4. Implementing approved plan of action.
         A2.6.7.4.5. Evaluating progress and outcomes.
         A2.6.7.4.6. Planning follow-up actions, if needed.
A2.7. REFERRAL IN RESPONSE TO ALL-HAZARD INCIDENT.
  A2.7.1. Whether in garrison or deployed, DMH team members must have a thorough
  working knowledge of base and local community resources. Individuals under stress benefit
  from receiving simple, concrete information and easy to understand written guidance on
  available referral sources (i.e. pamphlets, handouts). This written information serves as a
  quick reference for the individual.
A2.8. VICARIOUS TRAUMA (TAKING CARE OF THE CARE-TAKERS).
  A2.8.1. Even if not directly exposed to battle or all-hazards events, caretakers may
  experience vicarious trauma from the cumulative exposure of hearing the traumatic histories
  of others. Particularly vulnerable to vicarious trauma are those with personal trauma
  histories; newer, less experienced providers; and those who exhibit higher levels of empathy.
AFI44-153 29 MAY 2014                                                                       19


  A2.8.2. The team leader or the senior mental health provider must consider stress
  management/prevention for DMH team members and other associated helping professionals
  tailoring them to the needs of the agencies and situation.
  A2.8.3. As relief workers transition from the high operational environment back to normal
  operations after an incident they should be aware of expected responses and what to do in the
  case of unexpected symptoms and responses.
A2.9. MANAGEMENT OF COSRs.
  A2.9.1. Combat and Operational Stress Reactions (COSR) are not synonymous with a
  diagnosis of PTSD and should be managed differently. COSR represents the broad physical,
  mental and emotional signs that frequently result from exposure to combat or operational
  environments. By definition, COSR does not typically meet the clinical threshold for a
  diagnosis and most people with symptoms will recover successfully with the appropriate
  attention and time.
  A2.9.2. Some risk factors that will likely impact COSR may include the length of exposure
  to combat or operational stress, exhaustion due to cumulative effects of one or more of the
  following, lack of sleep, extreme physical stress, poor sanitary conditions, limited caloric
  intake, dehydration and extreme environmental conditions; severity of combat or operational
  stress experienced; history of previous trauma; mental health history; substance abuse; lack
  or social support or unit cohesion.
A2.10. MANAGEMENT OF POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.
  A2.10.1. Reference http://www.healthquality.va.gov/ptsd/ for full clinical practice guide
  including: Initial Evaluation and Triage, Acute Stress Reaction/Disorder-Prevention of
  PTSD, Management of Stress Reactions, and Assessment and Diagnosis of PTSD
