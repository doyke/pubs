1. Terminology.
   1.1. As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) Program. This is the Air Force policy for
   minimizing ionizing radiation exposure. ALARA means keeping radiation exposures as low
   as possible, consistent with existing technology, costs, and operational requirements.
   1.2. Base Radiation Safety Officer (BRSO). The BRSO is the overall manager of the Base
   Radiation Protection Program and is appointed in writing by the 14th Flying Training Wing
   Commander. This individual will provide consultation and advice on the degree of hazards

     associated with all forms of radiation. A bioenvironmental engineer (BE) or BE technician
     trained in radiation safety will serve as the BRSO (14 MDOS/SGOJ, 434-2285/2284).
     1.3. Unit Radiation Safety Officer (URSO). The URSO is the liaison official between the
     base and the unit. The term “Unit Radiation Safety Officer” is a functional title and is not
     intended to denote a commissioned status or a job classification. The unit can be a squadron,
     flight, or element.
     1.4. Permit Radiation Safety Officer (PRSO). The PRSO is designated within the terms in a
     USAF Radioisotope Committee permit or Nuclear Regulatory Commission license to
     manage the radiation protection aspects of radioactive materials use.
     1.5. Radioactive Waste. Radioactive materials no longer useful, repairable, or needed by the
     Air Force. Excess serviceable or repairable items containing radioactive materials are not
     considered radioactive waste.
2. Responsibilities.

     producing equipment/material (i.e., X-ray, radioactive material, radio frequency (RF)
     emitters, etc.) is used or maintained by the unit. The individuals appointed should be
     knowledgeable on operational characteristics of all radiation sources under his or her
     responsibility. Therefore, it is acceptable to appoint URSOs at the flight or element level at
     the commander’s discretion. The appointment will be in writing and will include the name of
     the unit represented and each individual’s name, duty phone, and office symbol. A copy of
     the appointment letter will be sent to the BRSO (14 MDOS/SGOJ).

   00-110N-7S-2, Handling and Disposition of Radioactive Electron Tubes and Spark Gaps.
   4.3. Generators of other RAM requiring disposal will submit a written request for disposal
   guidance to the BRSO. The request must contain as much of the following information as
   possible: name of item, quantity, radionuclide, physical form of the radionuclide (solid,
   liquid, gas), chemical form of the radionuclide, National Stock Number (NSN), activity of
   the item in millicuries, and the name and phone number of the point of contact.
5. Static Displays.
   5.1. The wing historian shall establish a radiation safety record for each historical aerospace
   vehicle managed in accordance with AFI 84-103. These records will detail all radioactive
   commodities present in each vehicle as documented by initial and periodic radiation surveys.


   5.2. The BRSO shall conduct an initial radiation survey of each static display and document
   findings on AF Form 3583, Static Display Aerospace Vehicle/Component Radiation
   Survey Log, and/or AF Form 3584, Static Display Aerospace Vehicle/Component
 10                                          COLUMBUSAFBI48-104 2 NOVEMBER 2011


   Radiation Swipe Log. If RAM are determined to be present in a static display vehicle, the
   BRSO will ensure radiation exposures to AF personnel and the public are kept within
   acceptable limits. In addition, if RAM is present, the BRSO will perform periodic surveys of
   the display every three years.
   5.3. If RAM is found to be present in a static display, all maintenance activity for the
   radioactive component(s) must be coordinated through the BRSO. Radioactive components
   must never be sanded, ground, machined, drilled, etched, or subjected to any process that
   produces respirable particles or changes the form of the component.
   5.4. Report any damage to radioactive components of static displays to the BRSO
   immediately.
6. BE will ensure the attached checklist review is completed prior to updating or rewriting
this supplement. BE will complete the attached checklist to evaluate the effectiveness of this
instruction as part of the 14 MDG semiannual self-inspection.
