This instruction implements AFPD 36-20, Accession of Military Personnel, and is used in
conjunction with ANGI 36-2001, Management of Training and Operational Support within the
Air National Guard (ANG), and ANGI 36-101, Active Guard/Reserve Program. It prescribes
ANG personnel policies and procedures within the assigned search and rescue/personnel
recovery region. It defines the personnel status individuals must be in when performing the
federal search and rescue missions. It also defines those events involving a federal mission that
will activate the 11 AF/CC’s delegated authority to order a member of the Air National Guard to
active duty under 10 U.S.C § 12301(d). The procedures specified in this instruction must be
followed on a day-to-day basis. This instruction applies to all personnel assigned to the 176th
Wing (176 WG) (ANG), 210th Rescue Squadron (210 RQS) (ANG), and 11th Rescue
Coordination Center (11 RCC) (ANG). Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the office of primary responsibility (OPR) (see Attachment 1) using the AF Form

processes in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Disposition Schedule.

    support 611 AOG and HQ 11 AF.
    2.3. The 210 RQS (ANG) and the 11 RCC (ANG) are Alaska ANG state organizations that
    support the 176 WG (ANG) operations.
3. Personnel/Duty Status.

    duty Title 10 status. There are no Title 32 ANG personnel assigned.
    3.2. The commanders of the 11 RCC and 210 RQS are in Title 10 active duty status when

    provide the federal mission link between the 176 WG and 611 AOG.
    3.3. The 176 WG/210 RQS (ANG) and 176 WG/11 RCC (ANG). All military personnel
    assigned to the 176 WG/210 RQS (ANG) and 176 WG/11 RCC (ANG) are in Title 32 ANG

    mission is declared, those personnel involved in the mission are instantaneously recalled to
    Title 10 status pursuant to their self-executing orders and 10 U.S.C § 12301(d). Upon self-
    activation to Title 10, those personnel are assigned to the 176 WG/210 RQS (ANGUS) and
    176 WG/11 RCC (ANGUS) and are under the Title 10 command authority of the 176
    WG/210 RQS (ANGUS) and 11 RCC (ANGUS) commanders. At the termination of the
    federal search and rescue mission personnel immediately revert back to their appropriate
    Title 32 status in the 176 WG/210 RQS (ANG) and 176 WG/11 RCC (ANG).
    3.4. As a condition of their employment, 176 WG rescue tasked personnel, including 176
    WG/210 RQS (ANG) and 176 WG/11 RCC (ANG) personnel, are required to execute an
    individual voluntary consent statement which sets forth their consent to be recalled to Title
    10 duty pursuant to 10 U.S.C § 12301(d) and paragraph 3.3, this instruction.
4. Events Involving a Federal Mission.
    4.1. The Secretary of the Air Force has authority under 10 U.S.C. § 12301(d) to activate
    ANG members to federal active duty, with the consent of the member and the Governor of
    Alaska. This authority has been delegated to 11 AF/CC. The Governor of Alaska has
    delegated the authority to consent to the activation of Alaska ANG members to federal active
    duty to The Adjutant General Alaska (TAG/AK).
    4.2. The 11 AF/CC authorizes instantaneous voluntary activation of ANG members upon a
    declaration of a federal search and rescue mission. The 11 AF/CC, or his/her delegee, may
    declare a federal search and rescue mission.
    4.3. A federal search and rescue mission is:
       4.3.1. For the 11 RCC:
11AFI36-2001 11 SEPTEMBER 2003                                                                   3


          4.3.1.1. Any mission that requires 11 AF/CC, or his/her delegee, through the 11
          RCC, to direct usage of high capability units to respond to an incident in which there
          is a high likelihood a person is in distress and in need of rescue or assistance.
          4.3.1.2. The 11 RCC is required to engage as the SAR mission coordinator (SMC), or
          participates in a SAR effort for which another RCC (or equivalent government
          agency) acts as SMC.
          4.3.1.3. The agencies of the State of Alaska are unable to perform the mission.
      4.3.2. For the 210 RQS (RQS):
          4.3.2.1. Any mission accepted by the 210 RQS; and
          4.3.2.2. Assigned a mission number.
   4.4. The 176 WG/210 RQS (ANG) and 11 RCC (ANG) personnel who participate in a
   federal search and rescue mission include aircrews, search and rescue duty officer (SARDO),
   officer in charge (OIC) of the 210 RQS, OIC of the 11 RCC and all participating controllers.
   Upon declaration of the federal search and rescue mission, these personnel are
   instantaneously recalled to Title 10 status. The physical location of personnel involved in a
   federal search and rescue mission is not a controlling factor in their instantaneous activation
   to Title 10 status. They do not need to be on base or at any other specific location if they are
   directly supporting a federal search and rescue mission. Those personnel who are involved
   in a federal search and rescue mission and who leave on break or who are relieved from duty
   at the end of a shift during a federal search and rescue mission immediately revert back to
   Title 32 status.
   4.5. A federal search and rescue mission terminates when the mission is closed by the RCC,
   suspended by 11 AF/CC or when 11 AF/CC, or his/her delegee, declares the event is
   terminated.
