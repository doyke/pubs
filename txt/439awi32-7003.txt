1. General. The Air Force Pollution Prevention Program goal is to reduce pollution by reducing
the use of hazardous materials. The Hazardous Materials Management Process (HMMP) is a tool
to achieve this goal by serving as a single point of control, referred to as the Hazardous Materials
Pharmacy (HMP) for tracking the ordering, distribution, storage, use and disposal of HAZMAT.
The HMMP team support staff will consist of representatives from the Safety Office (SEG),
Contracting (LGC), HAZMAT Pharmacy (LGRDMH), Bioenvironmental Engineering (SGPB),
and Environmental Management (CEV). The HMMP team members will research requests to
find less hazardous substitute items when necessary. The HMMP team will authorize HAZMAT
to a specific shop for a specific process and will authorize only the minimum quantity required.
HMMP team members will be involved throughout the life cycle of the product, from product
evaluation and authorization through issue, use and disposal. The full implementation of the
HMP will serve to protect WARB personnel, the surrounding community and the environment.
HMMP team members will ensure that all applicable supply, environmental, safety and health
regulations which apply to the HMP are followed.

      2.12.4. Return all used containers to HAZMAT building (1301).
3. Procedures.
   3.1. 439 AW Organizations. DoD, military, authorized tenants and BOS contract customers
   must submit process authorization requests through EESOH-MIS for every HAZMAT to be
   used in the shop.
   3.2. Ordering HAZMAT.
      3.2.1. Routine Requests. For ordering a new product, the customer will research the
      product in EESOH-MIS, obtain the MSN, add the MSN, draw amount & frequency to the
      applicable process, and submit the Process Authorization for review and approval
      through EESOH-MIS. Once the Process Authorization is approved, the customer will
      place an order through EESOH-MIS. HMP personnel will process the order through
      EESOH-MIS and ESS and deliver the material to the customer in accordance with
      AFMAN 23-110. In the case of a GPC or corporate credit card purchase, HMP
      employees will enter the approved request into the GPC purchase log and notify the
      customer that the purchase can be made. For reorders of authorized material from the
      customer’s approved HAZMAT list, the customer will place an order through EESOH-
      MIS and the material will be ordered by HMP employees and delivered to the customer.
      3.2.2. Priority Requests. Customers must check EESOH-MIS to see if the MSN is
      loaded, load the MSN, draw amount and frequency against the applicable process, submit
      the Process Authorization for approval and may follow-up with phone calls to SGPB,
      SEG and CEV so the authorization can be approved quickly. Once the Process
      Authorization is approved, the customer will order the MSN through EESOH-MIS, HMP
      employees will order the material through the ESS and deliver the material to the
      customer in accordance with AFMAN 23-110.
      3.2.3. GPC or corporate card purchase of HAZMAT. HAZMAT may be purchased by
      GPC when the normal supply channels cannot provide the product in a timely manner.
      All HAZMAT purchases by GPC must be authorized and reviewed through the HMP
      prior to each GPC purchase. HAZMAT must be previously approved for use for the
      requesting shop through process authorization steps of EESOH-MIS. If the HAZMAT is
      a new item for that particular shop, then the process authorization procedures must be
      followed for addition of the HAZMAT(s). Once approved and reviewed, the customer
      must provide the necessary product information including: MSN and/or part number,
      product nomenclature, manufacturer and, if different, the supplier, container size, and
      quantity to be purchased. After purchasing the HAZMAT, the customer must bring the
      HAZMAT and the invoice to the Pharmacy so the containers can be bar-coded. Product
      substitution must also be authorized in EESOH-MIS prior to purchase.
      3.2.4. If quantity authorized on a shop’s HAZMAT list is insufficient or excessive, shop
      personnel will use the process authorization steps (“proposing a change to an existing
      process) to increase/decrease individual HAZMAT quantities.
      3.2.5. Contact 557-3535 or Base Supply via two-way radio on the Maintenance net for
      swing shift requests or the recall roster for non duty hour priority requests.

     3.2.6. HMP personnel will deliver HAZMAT (accompanied by an MSDS for the
     particular product, manufacturer and batch/formula) during normal duty hours after
     processing in accordance with AFMAN 23-110.
  3.3. HAZMAT management.
     3.3.1. HAZMAT must be stored appropriately. Contact HMP, CEF or SGPB for
     guidance.
     3.3.2. Customer may not have inventory of more than the draw amount of HAZMAT
     originally requested in the Process Authorization in EESOH-MIS. Customer must
     maintain an updated copy of their authorized HMP prescription listing, which is accessed
     through EESOH-MIS.
     3.3.3. HAZMAT issued for deployments will automatically receive an extension to the
     requirement in paragraph 3.3.2. until the HAZMAT is returned to Westover ARB.
     3.3.4. Containers must be managed as follows:
        3.3.4.1. Containers having a usable quantity of HAZMAT remaining after use will be
        returned to the HMP for free issue in good condition (i.e., drips are wiped clean, lids
        are tightly sealed, container integrity is not compromised, barcode is legible, etc.).
        3.3.4.2. Customers with containers having remaining quantities of HAZMAT less
        than usable will contact CEV for a disposal determination. Prior to the turn-in, the
        customer must call the HMP to clear the container barcode.
        3.3.4.3. Used containers will be stored in the shop area until picked up by HMP
        personnel.
