This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 33-3, Information Management.
It provides guidance and procedures on creating, managing, and disseminating directive and
nondirective publications and forms throughout the Air Force. It applies to individuals at all
levels who prepare, manage, review, certify, approve, disseminate and/or use official Air Force
publications and forms, including the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard (ANG), except
where noted otherwise. This AFI may be supplemented at any level, but all supplements that
directly implement this publication must be routed to SAF/AAII Policy Branch for coordination
prior to certification and approval. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the
appropriate functional chain of command. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements
in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the
compliance statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, Table 1.1 for a
 2                                                                        AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


description of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers
through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately,
to the Publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air
Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS). The use of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial
product, commodity, or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force.

(934AW) This supplement implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI)
33-360. This publication applies to all Air Force personnel assigned to the 934th Airlift Wing.
Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publications.
Ensure that all records created as a result of the processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcssaf61a/afrims/afrims/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The publication has been revised. This rewrite of AFI 33-360 includes the new role of the
Publications Change Manager at the HAF. Establishment of this role is the first step to
implement future changes to the publications program processes that will continue this effort to
streamline and simplify how publications are developed, revised, and coordinated. Changes
within this rewrite include: Headquarters Air Force two-letter/digit officials responsibility to
appoint Publications Change Manager(s); adds role and responsibilities for new Publications
Change Manager; removes “IP and “I” suffixes to Interservice and Integrated publication
numbers, collapses technical/functional and mandatory coordination into a single round of
formal coordination; places responsibility on publication issuing organization to determine
appropriate coordinating offices. Reduces required coordinators to just legal and CIO review,
and SAF/AA for Policy Publications; identifies Tiered waiver authorities for unit level
compliance items; and removes restriction on number of Interim Changes (IC) and IC size
limitation.

(934AW) This supplement requires formal appointment of full-time personnel to monitor and
track progress of Wing publications as they go thru the coordination/approval process. It also
gives 934 CS/SCOK authority to rescind any Wing publication not meeting suspenses for
revisions.

                                          Chapter 1

             PROGRAM OVERVIEW AND OTHER COMPLIANCE AREAS

1.1. Overview. This publication establishes guidance and procedures for publications and forms
management Air Force-wide. Air Force units at all levels must ensure publications and forms are
complete, accurate, current, and accessible to Air Force users.
   1.1.1. Air Force publications (those listed in Table 4.1, Table 4.2, and processed IAW this
   publication) are used to issue official Air Force policies, guidance, and procedures; they
   serve to inform and to assign responsibilities.
   1.1.2. Forms provide an expanded capability to standardize and manage the collection,
   storage, retrieval, and display of data. Official forms are processed and disseminated IAW
   this publication. See Chapter 12 for complete details.
   1.1.3. Publications/Forms Processing.
       1.1.3.1. Draft and Collaborate. The process entails building a new or modifying an
       existing publication/form and obtaining subject matter expert (SME) inputs. See Chapter
       3 and Chapter 6 for general guidance and detailed procedures.
       1.1.3.2. Coordinate. Coordination of draft publications and forms will be accomplished
       IAW Chapter 7 of this publication.
       1.1.3.3. Certify and Approve. Obtain senior leaders’ certification and approval to
       publish as official policy, guidance, and/or detailed procedures. See Chapter 8 for
       detailed procedures.
       1.1.3.4. Publish. Publishing is addressed throughout publication or form development;
       however, it does not formally start until after the draft has been officially approved for
       publishing (AF Form 673, Air Force Publication/Form Action Request, signed). See
       Chapter 9 and AFMAN 33-361, Publishing Processes and Procedures, for further
       guidance.
1.2. Applicability of Publications and Forms.
   1.2.1. A publication or form applies only to the issuing headquarters’ staff elements and its
   subordinate activities (e.g., an “Air Force” Instruction [AFI] issued at the Headquarters Air
   Force [HAF] applies Air Force-wide; an “AFMC” Instruction [AFMCI] applies only to
   AFMC and units subordinate to AFMC; an “AMC” supplement applies only to AMC and
   units subordinate to AMC). Exception: At the operating location level (base/installation,
   site, etc.), Support Agreements, Memoranda of Agreement or Understanding, and other
   legally binding documents may extend applicability (the basis for this extension of authority
   and applicable units/orgs should be cited in the opening paragraph of the local publication
   [host base/tenant, Joint-Base, etc.]). Generally, Air Force publications do not apply to non-
   US Air Force organizations or activities, unless authority is specified in the publication.
   1.2.2. Lead Command (AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation and Responsibilities for
   Weapons Systems). While Lead Commands are responsible for developing detailed guidance
   and procedures for respective platforms/systems across organizational lines, the publications
   must be issued and approved at the departmental level. This means that while the Lead
 8                                                    AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


     Command is the authoring OPR and maintains the publication, the AFI/AFMAN must be
     certified and approved at the HAF.
1.3. Validity of a Publication or Form. Points of contact (POC), certifying officials, and
approving officials for Air Force publications and forms must be either military members or
civilian employees (including direct-hire foreign nationals, but not including contractors or
indirect-hire foreign nationals). (T-0). When an approving official vacates his or her position,
publications showing the individual’s signature element remain in effect until rescinded or
rewritten. When a unit reorganizes, current publications and forms remain valid and in effect
until superseded or rescinded.
1.4. Accessibility of Publications and Forms.
     1.4.1. Ultimately, publishing operations are designed to provide customers access to
     electronic and/or physical publications and forms. The e-Publishing web site (www.e-
     publishing.af.mil) serves as the official repository for departmental, command, and field
     publications and forms that are issued at the wing/base and above (excluding ANG wings).
     The e-Publishing web site is open to the public, so only the unclassified titles of classified
     and restricted access products will be provided, along with directions for accessing restricted
     web sites, and/or instructions on how to obtain copies from the OPR.
     1.4.2. The Warehouse Management System-BackOffice-Air Force Information Management
     Publishing Tool (WMS-BO-AFIMPT) is a web application that provides tracking and
     delivery of new or revised wing/base and above (excluding ANG wings) publications and
     forms to the Air Force Departmental Publishing Office (AFDPO). The application provides
     authoring OPRs/POCs, publications and forms managers and AFDPO the ability to change
     product metadata details, upload draft versions and supporting documents, submit for
     publishing, track submission, and disseminate the new or revised electronic publications and
     forms to customers via the e-Publishing web site or WMS modules ordering function. The
     web application does not include a workflow for coordination, certification, or approval of
     drafts (must use other workflow tools). The application is sometimes referred to individually
     by its parts (WMS, BO, AFIMPT), but they are interlinked and managed as a single web
     application.
     1.4.3. Publications and forms not supported by the AFDPO will be made available by local
     publications managers or OPRs on local web sites or physically distributed. (T-3).
1.5. Effective Dates. The publication date is the effective date of the policy or guidance (see
exception below); Air Force publications, to include Air Force Policy Memoranda and Guidance
Memoranda, are not considered effective until they are released to users IAW this publication.
(T-1). The publishing activity (AFDPO for e-Publishing, Publication Manager or OPR in
instances when local web sites are used) adds the date to the publication to reflect the day the
publication is actually released to users (placed on formal web site or made available for
ordering). The date the approving official signs the AF Form 673 may not be the effective date
shown on the publication. Exception: Entire publications or portions therein, may have future
effective dates that allow units/personnel time to prepare for compliance. The effective
date/timeframe must be identified in the opening paragraph and specific portions (if appropriate)
of the publication.
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                                  9


1.6. Overly Restrictive Delegations or Overly Broad Requirements. Air Force publications
must not impose overly restrictive requirements. This means a publication must NOT:
   1.6.1. Overly restrict delegation of authority. If a publication or related laws or directives do
   not state that they must personally take certain actions, the commander/director may delegate
   the authority to take the action. Only impose restrictions when there is a legal, financial, or
   other reason for the commander (or other official) to act personally. Use phrases such as "the
   commander/director (vice commander or other official) must personally," or "the
   commander/director may not delegate this authority," to restrict delegation.
   1.6.2. Impose unnecessarily broad tasking or requirements on activities and installations.
   Such tasking may create hardships at geographically separated units and remote locations
   with a small staff. If some units (or none at all) need not comply with some requirements,
   particularly those that create committees or boards, state these exceptions in the publication.
   1.6.3. Specify performing the function as an additional duty, or that a military member of a
   certain minimum grade or range of grades must perform a duty, unless legal requirements or
   other DoD or Air Force publications require such restrictions. You must allow commanders
   to manage essential functions, assign additional duties, and decide which personnel they will
   use to get the job done.
   1.6.4. Specify additional workload or financial obligations which would require manpower
   or financial resources that have not been approved or vetted by higher headquarters or the Air
   Force Corporate Structure.
1.7. Punitive Language.
   1.7.1. Punitive Enforceability of Publications Enforced under Article 92(1) of the
   Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
      1.7.1.1. In some instances, the matter discussed in a publication is of such consequence
      that failure to adhere to its proscriptions or mandates should be specifically punishable
      under Article 92(1). Punitive language in publications should be used sparingly and only
      for the most significant and serious matters. The “non-punitive” nature of a publication
      does not mean compliance is optional, or that a military member can’t be punished for
      violating non-punitive language in a publication. Compliance with both punitive and non-
      punitive mandatory language in publications is required by all Air Force personnel.
      Rather, punitive language in a publication means that a military member may face
      enhanced punishment under Article 92(1) of the UCMJ for violations, and may be found
      to have violated Article 92(1) regardless of their knowledge of the requirements
      established by the publication. Specific knowledge of the punitive nature of the
      publication is not necessary.
      1.7.1.2. For violation by military members of specific sections or paragraphs of a
      publication to be punishable under Article 92(1) of the UCMJ, opening paragraphs of
      publications must include specific enforceability language directing compliance by
      military personnel, including a description of the consequences of non-compliance
      statement identifying the relevant provision as punitive for purposes of Article 92(1) of
      the UCMJ. This same language must also be included in the specific punitive
      paragraph(s) (or sections) of the publication.
 10                                                 AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


       1.7.1.3. Article 92(1) of the UCMJ does not apply to the members of the ANG while in
       Title 32 status, but, they may be subject to an equivalent article under a state military
       justice code.
   1.7.2. Making Language in a Publication Punitive under Article 92(1). To be lawful,
   punitive language in a publication must be reasonably in furtherance of, or connected to,
   military needs (for example, promotes (i.e., reasonably necessary to accomplish a military
   mission or safeguard and protect morale, discipline, and usefulness of command and directly
   connected to the maintenance of good order); specific as to time and place, as applicable; and
   definite and certain in describing the act or thing to do or omit avoid; and not otherwise
   contrary to established law. ). Mandatory provisions place an affirmative duty upon the
   individual to do a certain act (e.g. lock a safe, follow a checklist, wear certain items, attend
   certain formations, etc.). Prohibitory provisions require that an individual not do something
   (e.g. enter a classified area, wear prohibited uniform combinations, drive in excess of a stated
   speed, etc.). Send all proposed punitive publications to the servicing legal office for review
   before issuance. (T-1).
   1.7.3. Structure of a Publication Containing Punitive Paragraphs. The opening
   paragraph of the publication must specify which paragraphs (or sections) in the publication
   contain punitive provisions that are enforceable under Article 92(1) of the UCMJ. A military
   member should be able to tell by looking at the introduction of the publication that it contains
   punitive provisions. The language standing alone in the opening paragraph does not by itself
   make a publication punitive; it becomes punitive when combined with the punitive language
   in the identified specific paragraphs or sections of the publication. Accordingly, the opening
   paragraph states that “Failure to observe the prohibitions and mandatory provisions in
   paragraphs (or section) xxxx of this publication by military members is a violation of Article
   92 of the UCMJ,” or similar language. (T-1).
   1.7.4. Punitive Language in Specific Paragraphs/Sections. In the punitive paragraph or
   section itself, use language that expresses the mandatory nature of the provision(s), such as
   “will,” “will not,” “shall,” “shall not,” “ must,” “must not,” etc. Paragraphs or sections
   containing these mandatory provisions or prohibitions must also state that a “Failure by
   military members to obey (the mandatory provisions in this paragraph (or section)) is a
   violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ,” or similar language. This statement may accompany
   each mandatory provision or prohibition of the punitive paragraph or section, or may refer to
   a series of mandatory provisions or prohibitions listed within a specific paragraph, but must
   clearly identify the mandatory provisions or prohibitions to which it applies.
1.8. Conflicting Publications.
   1.8.1. When guidance in a publication issued by a command or field unit conflicts with the
   guidance issued by a higher-level unit, the higher-level publication takes precedence. OPRs
   of publications that are found to be in error will immediately issue a GM to rectify the
   condition(s).
   1.8.2. When a unit issues a publication that conflicts with one of its own publications, the
   activity noting the discrepancy should submit an AF Form 847 to both OPRs highlighting the
   conflict and requesting a resolution. OPRs are responsible for working with each other to de-
   conflict and issue the correct publication(s). See Attachment 6 for instructions on submitting
   an AF Form 847.
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                              11


   1.8.3. If a field unit notices a discrepancy between higher-headquarters (HHQ) publications,
   submit an AF Form 847 to both OPRs, following the appropriate chain of command. AF
   Forms 847 submitted for departmental publications must be sent through the appropriate
   functional chain of command.
1.9. Waivers. When complying with official policy, guidance, and/or procedures, the unit may
request a waiver.
   1.9.1. The fundamental aim of a waiver must be to enhance mission effectiveness at all
   levels, while preserving resources and safeguarding health and welfare. A waiver is a
   method for a commander to communicate a risk management decision for a specified time
   period or circumstance in which:
       1.9.1.1. The cost of compliance (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or
       manpower) creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority task; OR
       1.9.1.2. The expected cost of compliance outweighs the benefit; OR
       1.9.1.3. Personnel cannot comply with the requirement due to a lack of resources
       (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower).
   1.9.2. When a commander approves a waiver, the commander is communicating to
   subordinates and superiors that the commander accepts the risk created by non-compliance.
   1.9.3. Each unit (wing or equivalent, and below, DRU, FOA) compliance item will be
   identified with a Tier waiver authority number using Table 1.1. Exception: Publications that
   are issued/approved below the T-3 level (Wing/DRU/FOA/CC) do not require tiering.
   1.9.4. Non-tiered compliance items that are targeted for unit’s above the wing or equivalent
   and above DRUs/FOAs, will identify the waiver authority in opening paragraph of the
   publication.

                   and to maintain rapport. (T-2).



T-3         Non-compliance may limit mission or program        Wing/DRU/FOA/CC
            effectiveness or efficiency and has a relatively   (delegable no lower than
            remote potential to create risk of mission or      Group/CC or equivalent)
            program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or
            unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse.
            Examples:
                   a. AFI 90-201, 6.3.4.6. (The Wing Self
                   Assessment Manager Will) Establish a
                   self-assessment frequency based on the
                   Wing CC’s direction (T-3).
                   b. AFI 90-201, 6.3.4.7. (The Wing Self
                   Assessment Manager Will) Provide the
                   Wing CC with periodic status updates.
                   (T-3).



   1.9.5. Waiver Process and Limitations.
      1.9.5.1. Waiver requests must come from commanders (or civilian directors) of the
      affected unit seeking relief from compliance through the command chain up to the
 14                                                   AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


       appropriate tier approval authority (i.e., Tier 0, 1, 2, 3) (or publications approval authority
       if non-tiered). (T-1).
       1.9.5.2. Waiver requests will be sent via e-mail or memorandum, and must include the
       following:
           1.9.5.2.1. Reference and text of the specific requirement for which the
           commander/director is requesting a waiver.
           1.9.5.2.2. Rationale for the waiver: Explain which of the 3 reasons listed under
           Paragraph 1.9.1 apply and describe why.
           1.9.5.2.3. Time period or circumstance for which the waiver will be required.
           1.9.5.2.4. Risk mitigation measures the requesting commander will implement during
           the waiver period.
           1.9.5.2.5. Impact if waiver is disapproved.
       1.9.5.3. Approval/denial of a waiver request will be completed within 30 days of
       submission by the requesting commander; denials will include a brief explanation.
           1.9.5.3.1. The approval authority may disapprove or approve the waiver in its
           entirety, or modify the waiver request as he/she sees fit.
           1.9.5.3.2. Commanders exercising their authority to waive an Air Force requirement
           must document their decision in writing or electronic record copy.
           1.9.5.3.3. Waiver Period.
              1.9.5.3.3.1. Tier 1, 2, and 3 waivers may be approved for a period not to exceed
              the requested waiver period or 30 calendar days after the approving commander’s
              tour length, whichever is shorter. Because waivers are the expression of a
              specific commander accepting risk, Tier 1, 2, and 3 waivers automatically expire
              30 days after a change of command unless the new commander renews the
              waiver.
              1.9.5.3.3.2. Waivers issued for non-tiered compliance items will be limited based
              on the approver’s determination and the waiver period must be identified in the
              approval message.
1.9.5.3.4. Approved waivers will be uploaded into Management Internal Control Toolset
(MICT) for inspection activity review and publication OPR’s situational awareness/filing.

       1.9.5.4. During the waiver period, the requesting commander/director will:
           1.9.5.4.1. Ensure appropriate waiver information is entered in the MICT within 7
           days of waiver approval notification.
           1.9.5.4.2. Implement risk controls to reduce, mitigate or eliminate the risk created by
           non-compliance.
           1.9.5.4.3. Actively work toward compliance by reducing the cost of compliance and
           remedying resource shortfalls (if applicable).

  “Registered” symbol (®). Distinguish each use of a trademark by inserting a trademark
  symbol (™) after the mark. Refer to AFI 51-303 for further guidance.
  1.12.7. Compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Because official
  unclassified Air Force publications are available on the e-Publishing web site, publications at
  any level must be Section 508 compliant, IAW AFI 33-393, Electronic and Information
  Technology Accessible to Individuals with Disabilities, Section 508. AFDPO is responsible
  for ensuring all publications posted on the e-Publishing web site are Section 508 compliant.
  1.12.8. Plain Writing Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-274, October 13, 2010). The Plain
  Writing Act of 2010 was enacted, “to improve the effectiveness and accountability of Federal
  agencies to the public by promoting clear Government communication that the public can
  understand and use.” To that end, it requires Federal agencies to use plain writing in all new
  or substantially revised issuances. As defined in the Act, plain writing is writing that is clear,
  concise, well-organized, and consistent with other best practices appropriate to the subject or
  field and intended audience. Such writing avoids jargon, redundancy, ambiguity, and
  obscurity. When drafting Air Force publications, you should, to the extent appropriate,
  follow       the      Federal      Plain      Language        Guidelines        available       at

AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                             17


   1.12.9. Compliance with AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System. OPRs must write
   publications to clearly identify compliance areas, using command voice and terms like
   “shall”, “must”, or “will” if compliance is required. As required by AFI 90-201, OPRs will
   create Self-Assessment Checklists (SACs) to facilitate commanders/directors self-assessment
   programs. SACs will not be included as part of the publication, however, they must reference
   back to compliance areas within the source publication (AFI, AFMAN, MAJCOM/Wing
   Supplement, etc.). SACs will be uploaded and maintained within the AFI 90-201 directed
   information system. Per paragraph 12.3.3, SACs will not be maintained as official forms.
   Refer to AFI 90-201 for detailed guidance on how to develop and distribute the SACs.

      Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).
1.13. Determining Applicability of Publications to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)
Units.
   1.13.1. All departmental publications that are applicable to the AFRC must be reviewed by
   AF/RE prior to publication. (T-2). Electronic coordination may be obtained by submitting the
   draft publication to the Chief of Air Force Reserve (AF/RE) workflow e-mail inbox
   (afrc.reworkflow@us.af.mil). The primary POC within AF/RE is responsible for obtaining
   coordination from other interested staff offices within AF/RE. Like all other coordinating
   offices, if the publication OPR does not receive a response or request for extension prior to
   the suspense date (minimum of two weeks), the OPR may annotate the coordination response
   as “Concur – No Response” and move on. The OPR of the publication must include a
   statement of applicability in the opening paragraph of the draft. AF/RE will either concur
   with the OPR’s chosen statement of applicability or supply a new statement. As the Air
   Force moves closer to total force functioning, publications should be written to support the
   functioning of all types of Air Force employees/members, including Reserve forces.
   However, when AF/RE takes exception (by providing a Critical comment) to specific
   portions of a publication due to dissimilarities with the way AFRC units operate, the OPR
   will not publish it until all critical comments are resolved. OPRs will require justification
   from AF/RE when exception is taken. Send unresolved issues to the appropriate Secretariat
   or Air Staff office for resolution, IAW AFI 10-301, Responsibilities of Air Reserve
   Component (ARC) Forces. Statements of applicability are as follows:
      1.13.1.1. When the entire publication applies, include the following statement: “This
      publication applies to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units.”
 18                                               AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


      1.13.1.2. When only specific portions apply, include a statement such as “Chapter (or
      paragraph—include specific number[s]) of this publication apply to Air Force Reserve
      Command (AFRC) Units.”
      1.13.1.3. When only specific portions do not apply include a statement such as “This
      publication applies to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units, with the exception of
      (list the portions that do not apply).”
      1.13.1.4. If the entire publication does not apply, include the following statement: “This
      publication does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units.”
      1.13.1.5. If changes to the publication are made during coordination that may affect the
      applicability to reserve units, the OPR must re-coordinate with AF/RE.
      1.13.1.6. If changes to the applicable publication occur after release, AF/RE or AFRC
      units must submit an AF Form 847 to the OPR of the publication if the changes affect the
      applicability status of the publication. OPRs receiving an AF/RE or AFRC request to
      change the applicability statement within a publication must comply.
   1.13.2. Determining Applicability of MAJCOM Publications to AFRC Units. All new
   and rewritten MAJCOM publications that are applicable to an AFRC unit must be reviewed
   by that AFRC unit prior to publication. (T-2). Electronic coordination may be obtained by
   submitting the draft publication to the HQ AFRC Tasker Workflow organizational account
   (afrc.ccx2@us.af.mil). HQ AFRC CCX will in turn task the applicable HQ staff office.
   Like all other coordinating offices, if the publication OPR does not receive a response or
   request for extension prior to the suspense date (minimum of two weeks), the OPR may
   annotate the coordination response as “Concur – No Response” and move on. The OPR of
   the publication must include a statement of applicability in the opening paragraph of the
   draft. AFRC will either concur with the OPR’s chosen statement of applicability (selected
   from statements provided in Paragraph 1.13.1.1 through Paragraph 1.13.1.4) or supply a
   new statement. Note: As the Air Force moves closer to total force functioning, publications
   should be written to support the functioning of all types of Air Force employees/members,
   including Reserve forces. However, when the AFRC takes exception to specific portions of a
   publication due to dissimilarities with the way AFRC operates, they must provide appropriate
   comments during coordination and the OPR will not publish it until all exceptions/critical
   comments are resolved. Like all critical comments, AFRC must provide adequate
   justification. Send unresolved issues to the appropriate Secretariat or Air Staff office for
   resolution, IAW AFI 10-301.
      1.13.2.1. If changes to the publication are made during coordination that may affect the
      applicability to reserve units, the OPR must re-coordinate with AFRC.
      1.13.2.2. If changes to the applicable publication occur after release, AFRC or AFRC
      units must submit an AF Form 847 to the OPR of the publication if the changes affect the
      applicability status of the publication. OPRs receiving an AFRC request to change the
      applicability statement within a publication must comply.
1.14. Determining Applicability of Departmental, Command, and Field Publications to the
Air National Guard (ANG):
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                             19


   1.14.1. All new and rewritten publications that are applicable to the ANG must be sent to the
   ANG for review. (T-2). The National Guard Bureau (NGB) authorized the ANG to review
   and approve ANG publications without additional NGB review (AFI 10-301). Exception:
   The NGB will review and approve all Interservice Publications that are applicable to the
   ANG/NGB; however, the process for Air Force OPRs remains the same. All publications
   will      be     submitted      to      angrc.ngb.a6.kom@ang.af.mil         (NIPR)         or
   ngb.a6kom@ang.af.smil.mil (SIPR); ANG will ensure Air Force and Interservice
   publications are disseminated to the appropriate reviewers within ANG/NGB. Like all other
   coordinating offices, if the publication OPR does not receive a response or request for
   extension prior to the suspense date (minimum of two weeks), the OPR may annotate the
   coordination response as “Concur – No Response” and move on.
   1.14.2. The OPR of the publication must include a statement of applicability in the opening
   paragraph of the draft. ANG will either concur with the OPR’s chosen statement of
   applicability or supply a new statement. As the Air Force moves closer to total force
   functioning, publications should be written to support the functioning of all types of Air
   Force members, including ANG forces. However, when the ANG takes exception to specific
   portions of a publication due to dissimilarities with the way ANG operates, the ANG will
   provide applicability or exception statements to the OPR of the publication for inclusion in
   the opening paragraph. OPRs will require justification from the ANG when exception is
   taken. Examples of opening paragraph statements are: “This publication applies to the Air
   National Guard (ANG),” “This publication does not apply to the Air National Guard
   (ANG),” or “This publication applies to the Air National Guard (ANG) only upon
   mobilization.”
   1.14.3. When an existing ANG and an applicable departmental or MAJCOM publication
   conflict, the ANG publication governs until the OPR and appropriate ANG official resolve
   the conflict. Resolve conflicts at the MAJCOM-level by including either an ANG-specific
   chapter or publishing a replacement ANG publication.
   1.14.4. If there are numerous exceptions, additions, or inclusions to a proposed publication,
   ANG will publish a separate publication. ANG will publish supplements identified as ANG
   supplements to both departmental and MAJCOM publications, using the same numerical
   designation as the parent publication.
1.15. Determining Applicability of Departmental and MAJCOM Publications to the Civil
Air Patrol (CAP). The CAP is the volunteer civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force
(USAF). In this capacity, the CAP performs Air Force missions as approved in the AFPD 10-27,
Civil Air Patrol, and AFI 10-2701, Organization and Function of the Civil Air Patrol.
Coordination of publications relating to noncombat missions is highly encouraged. Approval of
policies and procedures affecting the auxiliary must follow the normal chain of command.

  equivalent) as the PM/FM to administer the organization’s official publications and forms
  program IAW this publication. (T-3). Note: Depending on the structure of the organization,
  the publications and forms managers may be separate positions. Smaller activities may not
  have the resources to support a full-time PM/FM (some FOAs, in particular). Such activities
  should be supported by higher headquarters Publications/Forms management (thus
  eliminating the need for a local PM/FM) if that activity/organization agrees. Additionally, if
  a tenant on a base, the activity should, whenever possible, enter into a support agreement
  with the local PM/FM (see AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures).
  2.7.2. If the PM/FM function is contracted out or filled by an indirect-hire foreign national,
  the terms of that contract or employment agreement must be reviewed for legal and
  operational security soundness. PM/FM have access to publications generated within their
  activities and in other activities, so all legal and operational security concerns must be
  addressed before this function is performed by a contractor or an indirect-hire foreign

     2.7.3.1. Designee’s name(s), organizational designation, office symbol, e-mail address,
     telephone number, and workflow e-mail address if applicable.
     2.7.3.2. Workflow e-mail address of the office responsible for the Publications
     Management function. Creation of this e-mail box reduces risk of contact problems
     during personnel change over.

     manager will be responsible.
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                              25

      been made, POCs must state on the AF Form 673 that no re-coordination is necessary
      before the certifying and approval officials sign the form. If significant changes have
      been made, the POC must re-accomplish coordination.
   2.9.4. Based on the guidance in AFI 31-401 the POC, in collaboration with the PCM,

       32, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Manpower, Personnel and Services, and
       develops personnel policy, in coordination with Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for
       Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR), in a 36-series AFPD. The AF/A1 certifies
       the AFPD and the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) approves the AFPD. All
       departmental publications that implement the AFPD will then be certified by the AF/A1,
       although the implementing departmental publications may be authored and/or approved
       by a different HAF two-letter/digit that has been given responsibility/authority in the
       antecedent AFPD or AF/A1 approved AFI/AFMAN to provide specific personnel
       guidance for their functional area. AF/A1 exercises oversight of authority/responsibility
       given in HAF MD 1-32 and specific AFPDs through certification of those implementing
       36-series publications which are approved by other HAF two-letter/digits. In cases where
       the certifying official is also the approving official, the publications certifying task should
       be accomplished by an official below the level of the approving official and above the
       authoring OPR Exception: Certification of Doctrine is IAW AFI 10-1301, Air Force
       Doctrine.
       2.10.3.2. Refer to Attachment 2 for the list of numbered publication series and the

   certifying official should be one level above the authoring OPR if possible. If the official
 28                                                 AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


   one level above the OPR is the approval authority, the director/head of the authoring OPR or
   the approval authority may serve as the certifying official. (T-1).
   2.10.5. All departmental level publications/forms, and actions that change them, must be
   certified and approved by officials at the HAF level.

   publications and forms. Exception: Approval of Doctrine is IAW AFI 10-1301.
   2.11.3. MAJCOM Publications/Forms. Heads of functional two-letter/digit offices, or in
   their absence, acting heads of two-letter/digit offices, or their deputy heads approve these
   publications and forms. Exception: MAJCOM Commanders may move approval authority
   up to their level by annotating such in their MAJCOM Supplement to this publication.
   2.11.4. Publications/Forms below the HAF and MAJCOM level. Commanders/directors
   (acting commanders/directors, or deputy commanders/directors, if the commander/director is
   unable to provide approval) that are responsible for guidance/procedures pertaining to
   activities under their command/direction approve these publications and forms. (T-1).
   2.11.5. Approving officials at all levels:
      2.11.5.1. Approve the release of publications for compliance and enforcement and are
      solely responsible for ensuring the publications are necessary, current of information, and
      in conformance with existing laws, policy, guidance and Air Force Mission. Before
      signing the AF Form 673, it is the responsibility of the approving official to ensure the
      publication is not less restrictive than higher headquarters publications. If needed, it may
      be more restrictive, where appropriate.
      2.11.5.2. Enforce procedures and guidance contained in publications within their
      functional area(s).
      2.11.5.3. Confirm, by signing the AF Form 673 that the information therein is by order
      of the SECAF or Commander/Director, as appropriate. The functional principal’s

      2.11.6.1. Approving officials determine the need to delegate authority to sign as the
      approving authority on the AF Form 673 and/or provide functional coordination for
      revisions to publications.
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                                29


          2.11.6.1.1. The approval authority shall not be delegated outside of the issuing
          organization/unit/activity (e.g., HAF two-letter/digit, MAJCOM, Center, NAF, Wing,
          Group, Squadron). (T-3).
          2.11.6.1.2. When approval authority is delegated, the signature block/authentication
          on the actual publication (to include memos) will remain that of the approving official
          that delegated the authority (e.g., HAF two-letter/digit for departmental guidance
          publications, MAJCOM two-letter/digit for MAJCOM Publications, Wing
          Commander for Wing publications, etc.).
      2.11.6.2. Ensure the delegation of approval authority, whether for a single publication or
      a blanket request for several publications, is in writing, signed, dated, and either
      accompanies the AF Form 673 and the revised draft or remains on file with the PM/FM.

   publications and forms from their particular functional perspective or area of expertise based
   on the rules reflected in the formal coordination table (See Attachment 3).
   2.12.2. Publications and forms will be submitted to two-letter/digit organizations, unless
   otherwise directed in the formal coordination table provided in this publication or other
   applicable directive guidance. (T-3). Two-letter offices are responsible for ensuring the
   appropriate offices within the organization review and coordinate on the publication and/or
   form and for providing a consolidated response. The consolidated response does not
   necessarily have to carry a two-letter level signature; the two-letter may designate a lower-
   level office within the organization to provide the response and sign off on the coordination
   form provided (i.e., the AF Form 673 or the AF Form 1768).
   2.12.3. If an organization is not able to meet the suspense date for coordination, a request for
   an extension must be received by the OPR on or prior to suspense date, otherwise the
   package will not be delayed.
   2.12.4. Coordination may be provided on the AF Form 673, AF Form 1768 provided by the
   OPR, an approved automated tasking tool, or via e-mail. Use multiple forms or a
   continuation sheet, if necessary.
   2.12.5. In providing concurrence, reviewers agree to the contents within a publication/form
   from a functional perspective. Additionally, reviewers are agreeing to the releasability of the
   publication, as stated by the OPR in the publication. If the contents or purpose of a
   publication/form are in conflict with existing policy or guidance, or if the releasability as
   stated in the publication is not in keeping with guidance in AFI 31-401, reviewers must
   provide feedback to the OPR accordingly.
   2.12.6. (Added-934AW) A primary and alternate point of contact (POC) will be appointed
   in writing for each organization responsible for creating or maintaining publications,
   including operating instructions (OIs). Appointment letter will be sent to 934 CS/SCOK.
   (Attachment 2)
   2.12.7. (Added-934AW) The POC can be at any level within the organization, but will be a

                                    PROCESS OVERVIEW

3.1. Draft and Collaborate.
   3.1.1. Is a new publication or form required? Inadequate research could result in issuing
   more than one publication/form on the same subject, conflicting instructions, or publishing a
   nonessential or incomplete publication or form. Check the e-Publishing web site to find out if
   any other publication or form has a similar subject. If there is a related publication or form,
   consider consolidation/revision of publication or adoption of the form.
   3.1.2. Where to start?
       3.1.2.1. Review record set of previous publication actions to assist in determining SMEs,
       coordinators, and any issues encountered during previous action. The record set should
       be in the official files within the OPR or PM/FM’s office. See Attachment 5 for
       processing guides.
       3.1.2.2. Contact organization’s PCM for help determining the required coordinators,
       prioritizing the new/change action, and identifying the impact/risk if not published.
       3.1.2.3. Contact supporting PM/FM to notify him/her of the proposed action and obtain
       assistance with formatting and processing.
   3.1.3. Where are authorities found? Review higher authority policy, directives, and
   publications to identify specific directions and responsibilities that must be implemented.
   Ensure the implemented document contains direct authorities for the unit/organization/office
   issuing the publication. For example, DoD Issuances (Directives and Instructions) direct
   actions and assign responsibilities to the SECAF (aka: Head of DoD Component, Secretary
   of the Military Department, or Secretary of the Air Force). The SECAF then issues HAF
   MDs and AFPDs to delegate authority for implementation in the Air Force at the HAF 2-
   letters/digits level. The HAF 2-letters/digits then issue AFIs and AFMANs to provide
   detailed guidance, procedures, and to further assign responsibilities to 3/4 letter/digit offices,
   MAJCOMs, and Air Force Component Commands. Subordinate publications would cite the
   publication that directly addressed their responsibilities, not the highest-level directives.
   3.1.4. Obtain inputs from subordinate activities during the drafting process (prior to formal
   coordination) and add all suitable information to reduce the need for additional implementing
   publications. Regularly review publications for administrative changes (such as change in
   organization symbols, office realignment, OPR, etc.). Carefully review this publication for
   guidance on selecting the right publication/form type, formatting standards, coordination
   requirements, and maintaining the publication or form.
   3.1.5. See appropriate chapter (new, rewrite, interim change, administrative change, rescind,
   transfer, policy/guidance memorandum) in this publication for building the draft.
3.2. Staffing. HAF PCMs and OPRs must use the HAF Task Management Tool (TMT) to staff
publications/forms formal coordination, certification and approval packages. HOI 33-3,
Correspondence Preparation, Control, and Tracking, identifies TMT as the official
tasking/tracking tool for all task/staff packages within the HAF, and the integrated SharePoint
 32                                                   AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


system has been designated as the document repository for this tool. Use of TMT is optional for
collaborative actions/reviews (AO, SME, etc. levels) prior to submitting for formal coordination.
However, records managers are reminded that SharePoint and TMT are not a certified System of
Record. Unit records management shared drives have been designated as official records storage.
The following entries must be identified within the HAF TMT Tasker:
   3.2.1. Select the “AF Publications” or “AF Forms” entry in the pull-down list for the
   “Category” field.
   3.2.2. Select the appropriate priority level (1-4) in the pull-down list for the “Priority” field.
   3.2.2. (934AW) OPRs will collect coordination for publications/forms using AF Form 673.
   Coordination will be obtained using a consolidated e-mail thread or an approved automated
   tasking tool. Every effort will be made to obtain coordination using electronic signatures to
   ensure compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and Executive Order 13589,
   Promoting Efficient Spending. Note: Original documents containing endorsement become
   part of the publication’s record set; see Chapter 10 for further guidance on Records
   Management.
   3.2.3. Select appropriate action being taken (Coord, Sign, Approve) in the pull-down list for
   the “Action” field.
3.3. Formal Coordination. Refer to Chapter 7 for detailed guidance. 3.3.1. Coordinate with
all appropriate offices to ensure accuracy, currency, enforceability, and legality of the policy or
guidance. Use Table A3.1 as your starting point to determine coordinators.
   3.3.1. OPRs are permitted to collect coordination for publications/forms using e-mail,
   approved systems, or SSS in lieu of the AF Form 673. The staffing package does not have to
   include the AF Form 673. However, the endorsements received back from the staffing
   package (on e-mail, approved system, SSS, multiple AF Forms 673) for coordination must be
   transcribed to a master AF Form 673 prior to certification and approval. Note: Original
   documents containing the endorsement become part of the publications record set; see
   Chapter 10 for further guidance on Records Management. The transcribed endorsement will
   not include the digital or wet signature.
3.4. Certification. Refer to Chapter 8 for detailed guidance.
   3.4.1. The Certifying Authority is at the issuing level (e.g. MAJCOM publications are
   certified at the MAJCOM). They certify the need for the publication, to include currency of
   information, applicability to the Air Force, and propriety of content. See Attachment 3.
   3.4.2. Appropriate staffing package must include an AF Form 673 for signature.
3.5. Approval. Refer to Chapter 8 for detailed guidance.
   3.5.1. The approving authority is a senior leader at the issuing level responsible for policies
   and guidance/procedures pertaining to their functional area, specialty series, or assigned
   command. SECAF approves all AF policy publications.
   3.5.2. An appropriate staffing package must include an AF Form 673 for signature.
3.6. Publishing. Refer to Chapter 9 for detailed guidance.

  3.6.1. All publications/forms are hosted on e-Publishing web site (departmental, command,
  and field publications/forms that are issued at the wing/base and above (excluding ANG
  wings/subunits)). The e-Publishing web site is open to the public, so only the unclassified
  titles of classified and restricted access products will be provided, along with directions for
  accessing restricted web sites, and/or instructions on how to obtain copies from the OPR:
     3.6.1.1. OPR sends final package to his/her PCM and/or publications manager/forms
     manager (PM/FM).
     3.6.1.2. PCM and PM/FM review and the PM/FM forwards to AFDPO as appropriate.
     3.6.1.3. AFDPO reviews and processes to e-Publishing web site and notifies OPR and
     PM/FM when posted.
  3.6.2. Publications/forms that are issued below the wing level (including ANG
  wings/subunits):
     3.6.2.1. OPR sends final package to his/her PM/FM.
     3.6.2.2. PM/FM reviews and PM/FM processes for local dissemination.
  3.6.3. Final Package includes:
     3.6.3.1. Approved draft and supporting graphic files.
     3.6.3.2. Completed AF Form 673 (reflects appropriate coordination, certification, and
     approval).
     3.6.3.3. OPR and POC information (Names, addresses, phone numbers, and
     Organization Box).

                                    PUBLICATION TYPES

4.1. Types of Publications. By order of the Secretary of the Air Force, official Air Force
publications (those listed in Table 4.1 and processed IAW this publication) issue official Air
Force policy and/or guidance. Unless otherwise identified in Table 4.1, all publication types
require an AF Form 673 to publish, which is then maintained as part of the record set.
Publications are separated into two categories: Directive and Nondirective.
     4.1.1. Directive Publications. These publications are necessary to meet the requirements of
     law, safety, security, or other areas where common direction and standardization benefit the
     Air Force. Air Force personnel must comply with these publications. All publications in this
     category must carry the following statement in the publication header: “COMPLIANCE
     WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY.” Failure to comply with these written
     “directions” may be punishable by the UCMJ. With the exception of restricted publications
     and those generated below wing/base level and by ANG wing/subunits, publications/memos
     listed in Table 4.1 will be hosted from the e-Publishing web site. Additional exceptions on
     where publications are hosted may be found within the table. Directive publication types are
     listed in Table 4.1.

3    Directories     Departmental, All Levels    Directories are informational
                     Command and                 publications. They are usually in
                     Field                       alphabetical or classed order, such as a
                                                 listing of addresses, affiliations,
                                                 functions, and similar data.
4    Handbooks       Departmental, All Levels    Handbooks are reference books of a
                     Command and                 particular subject or a compilation of
                     Field                       factual data and instructional material
                                                 not subject to frequent revision.
                                                 Commands and field units may issue
                                                 handbooks that are applicable to their
                                                 subordinate units.
5    Catalogs        Departmental, All Levels    Catalogs are informational publications
                     Command and                 that describe and/or list a particular
                     Field                       collection of information.
6    Visual Aids (VAs)Departmental, All Levels   VAs are posters or graphic illustrations.
                      Command and                OPRs issue them for display on walls,
                      Field                      bulletin boards, desks, base facilities,
                                                 and other places. OPRs should combine
                                                 and issue VAs at the highest levels,
                                                 when possible. There are two kinds:
                                                 Permanent VAs. These explain or
                                                 instruct. An example is a chart
                                                 portraying military insignia. Permanent
                                                 VAs must be attributable to guidance or
                                                 information in a directive publication;
                                                 there is no need to list VAs in the related
                                                 publication, but OPRs must indicate the
                                                 related publication number on the VA;
                                                 e.g., “AFVA11-240 (Per AFI 1111-
                                                 218)” or “AMCVA90-301 (Per AFI 90-
                                                 301).” Temporary VAs. These inform
                                                 or motivate, such as a poster promoting
                                                 safe driving. As a rule, limit display to
                                                 180-calendar days or less. Show an
                                                 expiration date in small type at the
                                                 bottom of the VA; e.g., “Expires 30 May
                                                 2009.” If the VA shows the date of an
                                                 event, you may eliminate the expiration
                                                 date. AFDPO does not support the
                                                 development or dissemination of
                                                 temporary VAs; OPRs must develop
                                                 temporary VAs independently, in

4.2. Variations of Publications.
     4.2.1. Installation Publications. Installation commanders have the authority to issue
     installation publications (e.g., Scott AFB Instruction, etc.). Unless limited by waivers granted
     under host-tenant agreements (see AFI 25-201), installation publications apply to all assigned
     or attached units. They also apply to geographically separated units (off-base and remote site)
     if the subject matter covers the support and services given them by the issuing installation.
     With the exception of ANG wing/subunits, installation publications will be posted to the e-
     Publishing web site.
     4.2.2. Joint Base Publications. Installation/base-level publications contain procedures for
     supporting and supported components on Joint Bases only. The authority must be defined in
     a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Joint Based components. (T-3).
        4.2.2.1. When the AF is the Supporting Component: The Air Force publication number,
        command approval, and accessibility and releasability statements precede those of the
        other component. Place an Interservice Publication Distribution List, with Air Force
        information first, in the header of the document. The Air Force OPR develops and
        processes the publication according to this publication. The Air Force OPR sends a draft
        to the supported component for coordination. The supported component must provide a
        component specific publication number and printing and shipping instructions (if
        applicable). The Air Force OPR works with the supported component to resolve any
        issues identified during coordination. The Air Force OPR completes coordination, then
        certification and approval. The Air Force OPR shows all coordination, including those
        obtained from the supported component, on the AF Form 673, and sends one electronic
        copy of the draft to the supporting publications manager who will forward to AFDPO for
        processing and posting onto the e-Publishing web site. The Air Force OPR must provide
        the supported components OPR with a link to the publication on the e-Publishing web
        site. (T-1).

     4.2.2.2. When the AF is the Supported Component: The supporting component’s OPR
     develops and formats the publication according to their publishing procedures and sends
     the draft to the Air Force functional OPR for formal coordination. At this point, the Air
     Force OPR obtains a publication number from their local publications manager and
     provides it along with any comments to the supporting components OPR. The Air Force
     OPR works with the supporting component to resolve any differences identified during
     coordination. The supporting component’s publishing activity notifies the Air Force OPR
     when the publication is released and provides a link to the published version. The Air
     Force OPR must send the link to the supporting publications manager who will forward
     to AFDPO for release on the e-Publishing web site. (T-1).
     4.2.2.3. Air Force OPRs for joint base publications, whether the Air Force is the
     supporting component or not, must meet the responsibilities and requirements for OPRs
     established in this publication. (T-1).
  4.2.3. Interservice Publications. Interservice Publications contain departmental level
  mutually agreed-upon procedures the Air Force and one or more of the military departments
  or DoD agencies (such as the Defense Logistics Agency [DLA]) need to carry out a common
  mission or function. These publications may be of any directive or nondirective type listed in
  Tables 4.1 and 4.2.
     4.2.3.1. When the Air Force is the lead agent: The Air Force publication number,
     command approval, and accessibility and releasability statements precede those of the
     other Military Departments or agencies. The publication header will have multiple
     publication designations and numbers that represent all services involved; list the Air
     Force information first. The Air Force OPR develops and processes the publication
     according to this publication.
         4.2.3.1.1. The OPR sends a draft to each Military Department or agency OPR for
         final approval. In the memorandum, specifically request verification of their
         publication number, approving authority, distribution list, printing requirements, and
         shipping instructions (if applicable).
         4.2.3.1.2. The OPR then completes formal HAF coordination. The OPR shows all
         coordination, including those obtained from other Military Departments, on the AF
         Form 673, and sends one electronic copy of the draft along with a signed AF Form
         673 to AFDPO for processing.
     4.2.3.2. When the Air Force is not the lead agent: The lead agent’s OPR develops and
     formats the publication according to the lead agent’s publishing procedures and sends the
     draft to the Air Force functional OPR for preliminary coordination. At this point, the Air
     Force OPR obtains the publication number from AFDPO. After the preliminary
     coordination has been returned to and reviewed by the lead agent, the updated draft is
     then returned to the Air Force OPR for final formal HAF coordination.
         4.2.3.2.1. The Air Force OPR obtains and shows all coordination on the AF Form
         673; has the certifying and approving authorities sign it; and sends the approved draft,
         by memorandum, to the lead agent for processing. The Air Force OPR works with the
         lead agent to resolve any differences identified during coordination. The lead agent’s
         publishing activity sends a memorandum with a 30-calendar-day suspense to the Air
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                            43


        Force OPR requesting verification of publication number and approving authority,
        accessibility and releasability statements, printing requirements, and shipping
        instructions. The lead agent’s publishing activity notifies the OPR when the
        publication is released and provides a link to the published electronic version.
        4.2.3.2.2. The Air Force OPR must send the link, the completed AF Form 673, and
        the approved draft to AFDPO for release on the e-Publishing web site.
     4.2.3.3. Air Force OPRs for interservice publications, whether the Air Force is the lead
     agent or not, must meet the responsibilities and requirements for OPRs established in this
     publication. AFDPO assigns control numbers for departmental interservice publications;
     the publishing manager assigns control numbers for MAJCOM interservice publications.
     Interservice Publications are posted on the e-Publishing web site.
  4.2.4. AF Supplements to DoD Issuances.
     4.2.4.1. AF Supplements are departmental level publications that contain the full text of
     a DoD Issuance and Air Force added material. Supplements receive an appropriate AF
     publication number in addition to the number of the issuance (e.g. DoD 5400.7-
     R_AFMAN 33-302). See AFI 90-101, Processing Department of Defense Issuances, for
     additional guidance on Air Force implementation of DoD Issuances.
     4.2.4.2. AF Supplements to DoDDs and DoDIs that establish policy carry the same
     weight as AFPDs and are subject to the same requirements; AF Supplements to DoD
     issuances that implement policy established in a DoDD or DoDI carry the same weight as
     directive, departmental publications listed in Table 4.1 and must be processed
     accordingly.
     4.2.4.3. All publications must be at least as restrictive as the higher headquarters
     publication they implement and must not contradict the higher headquarters publication.
     When the supplemented/implemented publication changes, the subordinate publications’
     OPR will conduct a special review to determine currency. Refer to Chapter 5 for details
     on how to accomplish a special review.
  4.2.5. Command/Field Supplements.
     4.2.5.1. Command//field supplements extend or add material to Air Force higher
     headquarters publications. With the exception of AFPDs, AFPMs, AF supplements to
     DoDDs, and DoDIs (a direct supplement to a DoDI carries the same weight as an AFI;
     command/field units may supplement the AF supplement to the DoDI), command/field
     units may directly supplement any higher headquarters publication unless otherwise
     directed by the OPR. The content of the supplement is integrated into the higher level
     publication; unless specifically requested as a standalone supplement (not-integrated) by
     the OPR. IfIf there is no higher headquarters or departmental instruction or manual
     available to supplement, command/field units may issue a standalone instruction or
     manual.
     4.2.5.2. All publications must be at least as restrictive as the higher headquarters
     publication they implement and must not contradict the higher headquarters publication.
     (T-1). When the supplemented/implemented publication changes, the subordinate

      publications’ OPR will conduct a special review to determine currency. (T-3). Refer to
      Chapter 5 for details on how to accomplish a special review.
      4.2.5.3. Supplements issued below the wing/base and by ANG wings/subunits will not
      be integrated into the basic publication (known as a “Standalone” supplement). (T-3).
4.3. Content Limitations and Restrictions.
   4.3.1. AFPDs and AF supplements to DoDDs may only be directly implemented by AFIs
   and AFMANs. DoD Issuances may only be directly supplemented or implemented by a
   department-level publication.
   4.3.2. Unless otherwise noted in the opening paragraph of the specific publication, all AF
   publications, except AFPDs, may be supplemented. Exceptions:
      4.3.2.1. If no departmental-level guidance is provided (e.g., AFIs, AFMANs),
      command/field units may issue command/field instructions to directly implement AFPDs
      and AF supplements to DoDDs. Once higher headquarters guidance is published, the unit
      must rescind/revise its instruction to implement the higher headquarters guidance.
      4.3.2.2. Command activities may not issue command doctrine documents, nor may they
      supplement basic or operational Doctrine.
   4.3.3. Do not put the following in your publication:
      4.3.3.1. Articles intended only to encourage or obtain the support of persons outside the
      Government.
      4.3.3.2. Editorials, book reviews, or articles that are political, representing clear attempts
      to lobby for or against legislation or increased appropriations.
      4.3.3.3. Partisan political campaign articles or editorials.

       publication to identify the office and contact information for specific publications and
       forms managers.
   5.2.2. The PCM provides organization and content specific guidance to assist in building the
   publication formal coordination package and identifying waiver authorities. The publication
   staffing package must contain the following information:
       5.2.2.1. What is changing and why.
       5.2.2.2. Impact and risk of not implementing.
       5.2.2.3. Risk assessment rating (using appropriate RM publication) and priority for
       processing.
           5.2.2.3.1. Processing Priority 1. Extremely High.
           5.2.2.3.2. Processing Priority 2. High.
           5.2.2.3.3. Processing Priority 3. Medium.
           5.2.2.3.4. Processing Priority 4. Low.
       5.2.2.4. Required coordinators.
       5.2.2.5. Who will certify and approve the final publication/form.
5.3. Creating a New Publication.
   5.3.1. A new publication may be required when existing publications cannot be modified to
   incorporate new subject matter content (policy, guidance or procedures). In such cases,
   contact the local publications manager for advice concerning choosing a publication type,
   creating a title, coordinating the draft publication. He/she provides templates and a

   publication number, and receives approved draft and AF Form 673 for publishing.
   Attachment 5 to this publication provides step-by-step processing guidance.
   5.3.2. Required activities for new publications:
      5.3.2.1. Draft and collaborate with PCM and/or Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) (See
      Chapter 6).
      5.3.2.2. Formal Coordination.
   5.3.2.3. Certifying Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673.
      5.3.2.4. Approving Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673.
      5.3.2.5. Submit to publications manager for final processing.
5.4. Publication Currency/Review.
   5.4.1. OPR Initiated. OPRs are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and currency of their
   publications and must take actions to revise or rescind publications as necessary. An OPR
   may review his/her publication at any time and update it to reflect changes in laws, policy,
   guidance, or procedures. They may also certify their publications current at any time. OPRs
   are responsible for initiating actions to keep their publications current.
   5.4.2. Periodic required review (every 4 years). Publications managers initiate a review
   task to the publication OPR every four years on the anniversary month of the publications
   effective date or last certified current date, whichever is later. OPRs are required to review
   their publication and associated prescribed forms and provide the status of each. (T-3).
   5.4.3. Special Review. Changes to mission, implemented publications, laws, regulations,
   policies, or reorganizations are some examples of initiators of a special review. Publications
   managers will, upon request or once made aware of need for review, initiate a review task to
   the publication OPR and track the review. Once a special review is initiated, it is a mandatory
   action. (T-3).
   5.4.4. Periodic and Special Review Task. OPRs will be given at least 30 days to assess
   their publications and forms and respond with a status back to the publications manager on
   an AF Form 399. Both the OPR and either the approving official (for departmental
   publications) or certifying official (for MAJCOM and below publications) must sign the AF
   Form 399 when returning the status. (T-3).
      5.4.4.1. Status responses include “Certify Current,” “Requires Revision,” “Requires
      Transfer,” or “Is Obsolete.” OPRs may also identify if a physical publication or form
      may be converted to electronic format – AF is mandated to reduce printing costs and
      must convert physical/printed media as much as possible.
      5.4.4.2. If a status of “Certify Current” is submitted for the publication and associated
      prescribed forms, the action is complete.
      5.4.4.3. If a status other than “Certify Current” is provided, the OPR is given 180 days to
      complete the identified action.
      5.4.4.4. If no response is provided to the task, the publications manager may initiate a
      rescind action. The publications manager must staff an AF Form 673 to the certifying
      and approving officials to rescind the publication and all associated prescribed forms.
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                                 47


   5.4.5. Customer Identified Changes or Conflicting Material. Any Air Force member or
   employee may report errors, suggest revisions, and recommend corrective action by
   submitting an AF Form 847 to the OPR, or through the appropriate functional chain of
   command for higher headquarters publications (refer to Attachment 6 for instructions on
   completing the AF Form 847).
       5.4.5.1. When a unit issues a publication that conflicts with one of its own publications,
       the activity noting the discrepancy should submit an AF Form 847 to both OPRs
       highlighting the conflict and requesting a resolution. OPRs are responsible for working
       with each other to deconflict and issue the correct publication(s).
       5.4.5.2. If a command/field unit notices a discrepancy between higher-headquarters
       publications, submit an AF Form 847 to both OPRs, following the appropriate chain of
       command. AF Forms 847 submitted for departmental publications must be sent through
       the appropriate functional chain of command. (T-2).
5.5. Certification of Publication as Current.
   5.5.1. If during a periodic or special review the OPR determines there are no required
   changes to the publication, the OPR may indicate such status on the AF Form 673 or AF
   Form 399 and submit it to the appropriate PM/FM. The publication OPR and either the
   approving official (for departmental publications) or certifying official (for MAJCOM and
   below publications) must sign the form, no coordination is required. (T-1). Note:
   Publications must meet content requirements as identified in Chapter 6 of this publication to
   be considered current.
   5.5.2. AFDPO will mark the publication “Certified Current on” plus the effective date,
   directly below the existing published date on the publication.
   5.5.3. This action establishes the new periodic review date for the next four-year cycle.
   5.5.4. OPRs may certify their publications current while accomplishing an Interim Change if
   appropriate. Ensure the “Certify Current” block is checked on the AF Form 673 and the
   staffing package for the IC identifies that the action will also certify the publication current.
   5.5.5. Publication rewrites and certified current actions reset the four-year review cycle.
5.6. Update/Revise an Existing Publication.
   5.6.1. Changing the policy, guidance, or procedures found in official publications is
   accomplished by rewriting the publication or issuing an IC, Administrative Change (AC),
   AFPM, or GM to the specific publication. Changes using any other vehicles/mechanisms are
   not permitted as they can create conflict with officially published policy and guidance, and
   cause confusion that could degrade mission accomplishment and safety.
   5.6.2. Changes to publications are either permanent or temporary and they are either
   integrated into the publication or are simply attached on top of the publication. This section
   defines the different types of changes and whether they are permanent/temporary or
   integrated/attached.
       5.6.2.1. Permanent change is effective for the life of the published version (rewrite, IC).
       5.6.2.2. Temporary change expires after a period of time (AFPM, GM).
48                                                 AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


     5.6.2.3. Integrated change will be physically inserted into the text of the original
     document (IC).
     5.6.2.4. Attached change is a separate document that sits on top of the original
     document and notifies the reader that the original has changed. The text changes are not
     physically made to the original document (AFPM, GM, AC).
  5.6.3. Publication Rewrite (Permanent & Integrated).
     5.6.3.1. A full publication rewrite is accomplished when major changes to the policy,
     guidance, and/or procedures are warranted/needed.
     5.6.3.2. Use the published version as a starting point for the rewrite, as appropriate. The
     electronic record set should contain the Word version of the last final draft. Your
     publications manager may also be able to assist in providing an editable version to start
     your rewrite.
     5.6.3.3. A rewrite is a clean start to the publication, so you have the ability to renumber
     and remove “DELETED” paragraphs/sections from previous ICs. The rewrite must
     incorporate any existing ACs, AFPMs or GMs that are attached to the publication.
     5.6.3.4. Required activities for a publication rewrite:
        5.6.3.4.1. Draft and collaborate with PCM and/or SMEs.
        5.6.3.4.2. Formal Coordination. (T-3).
        5.6.3.4.3. Certifying Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-1).
     5.6.3.4.4. Approving Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-1).
        5.6.3.4.5. Submit to publications manager for final processing.
  5.6.4. Interim Change (IC) (Permanent & Integrated).
     5.6.4.1. Action taken to swap-out paragraphs, chapters, attachments, tables, figures
     within a publication with new paragraphs, chapters, attachments, tables, figures. Take
     this action when a full rewrite is not warranted/needed.
     5.6.4.2. ICs cannot be issued to change AFPMs or GMs. These publications must be re-
     issued in their entirety if changes are required.
     5.6.4.3. An IC is drafted as a Microsoft Word® document with a short header, Summary
     of Changes, and just those paragraphs, tables, figures, and attachments that will be
     swapped out in the published version. See Figure 5.1 for visual sample. Exception: If
     the publication being changed was not processed and formatted by AFDPO the OPR
     must integrate the new material in the existing publication and provide the camera ready
     version (in a Microsoft Word® document) to their publications manager for processing.
     OPR will identify the changed material with an asterisk (*) preceding the paragraph,
     table, figure, or attachment number.
        5.6.4.3.1. Submit the IC in Microsoft Word®, 12-point Times New Roman font.
        5.6.4.3.2. Changes will be made in complete paragraphs, (i.e., submit the entire
        paragraph 3 to replace the existing paragraph 3, even if only one word or one
        sentence changed). A change must not renumber existing content; you may add new
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                              49


         paragraphs or sub-paragraphs (or figures, chapters, etc.) as needed to insert additional
         material without renumbering the existing content. Changed material will be
         identified with a margin bar when the integrated publication is formatted by AFDPO
         or asterisks if formatted by the OPR.
         5.6.4.3.3. A deleted paragraph requires a placeholder that cites the paragraph number
         and the word DELETED, (e.g., “3.77. DELETED”). Note: References to deleted
         content must be removed and the document re-numbered during a rewrite.
         5.6.4.3.4. Figures, Tables, and Attachments. Completely delete or provide a revised
         figure, table, or attachment to replace the current figure, table, or attachment. New
         figures, tables, and attachments can be added as long as there is a reference to them in
         a paragraph.
      5.6.4.4. Required activities for an IC:
         5.6.4.4.1. Draft and collaborate with PCM and/or SMEs.
         5.6.4.4.2. Formal Coordination. (T-3).
         5.6.4.4.3. Certifying Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-1).
         5.6.4.4.4. Approving Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-1).
         5.6.4.4.5. Submit to publications manager for final processing.

  5.6.5. Administrative Change (AC) (Permanent & Attached).
     5.6.5.1. ACs are those that do not affect the subject matter content, authority, purpose,
     application, and/or implementation of the publication. Since these types of changes are
     non-substantive, no coordination is required. While there is no limit to the number of
     ACs to a publication, all changes must be consolidated into one document.
     5.6.5.2. ACs include: Office symbol changes (OPR, certifying official’s office symbol,
     and office symbols mentioned in the text) due to a transfer of responsibility for a function
     or a publication, or as a result of a reorganization. Other changes may be made on a
     waiver basis; submit waiver requests to your publications manager.
     5.6.5.3. Only OPRs may initiate ACs to their publications. Either the approving official
     (for departmental publications) or certifying official (for MAJCOM and below
     publications) must sign the AF Form 673; SAF/AA will approve ACs to AFPDs and AF
     supplements to DoDDs. (T-3).
     5.6.5.4. ACs will not be integrated into the basic publication, but will appear as the first
     page(s) when the publication is opened from the e-Publishing site. The AC notification
     will be removed when the publication is next updated (IC or rewrite). OPRs must include
     ACs in an IC or a rewrite to incorporate changes into the actual publication.
     5.6.5.5. Submit the AC in Microsoft Word®, 12-point Times New Roman font. See
     Figure 5.2 for visual sample of an AC. The AC must contain directions that let the
     reader know what changes are effective (e.g., References to AF/DP should be changed to
     AF/A1 throughout the publication; references to SAF/AAX should be changed to
     SAF/AAII Policy Branch in paragraphs 1.5 and 3.6). (T-3). A date will be assigned to
     that AC when it is posted with the publication and placed at the end of the description of
     changes.
     5.6.5.6. ACs will be listed chronologically in one document. It is the OPR’s
     responsibility to keep an updated list of ACs; OPRs will submit a complete list of all
     changes each time a new AC is added. The date assigned to each previous AC must be
     incorporated into the document submitted by the OPR (e.g. References to AF/DP should
     be changed to AF/A1 throughout the publication; references to SAF/AAX should be
     changed to SAF/AA in paragraph 1.5 and 3.6. 15 March 2005.).
     5.6.5.7. Unless explicitly stated, the addition of an AC will not cancel existing ACs. If
     explicitly stated (e.g. References to AF/XOI should be changed to AF/A2; this supersedes
     the AC dated 31 March 2006), “Canceled” will be inserted by the OPR next to the date of
     the superseded AC. Once an IC is made to a publication or the publication is rewritten, all
     ACs posted for that publication will be removed from the e-Publishing web site.
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                           51


Figure 5.2. Sample Administrative Change.




   5.6.6. Air Force Policy Memorandum (AFPM) and Guidance Memorandum (GM)
   (Temporary & Attached).
      5.6.6.1. AFPMs and GMs are used to issue or change policy or guidance when there is
      not enough time to process a new publication or take an action to permanently change an
      existing publication. The memorandum has a reduced coordination and approval process
      to expedite delivery, but this reduces opportunity for organizations to evaluate impact.
      For this reason, the use of AFPMs and GMs must be reduced to only those instances
      where immediate release is required due to immediate risk to life, safety, property, or
      mission.    Note: “Policy letters,” endorsement letters, guides, and bulletins are not
      recognized as part of the publishing program; any new guidance or information issued in
      a policy/endorsement letter, guide, or bulletin requiring implementation/compliance must
      be established in a publication type described in this publication and processed
      accordingly.
      5.6.6.2. Punitive Language in AFPMs, AFGMs, and Command/Field GMs. All AFPMs,
      AFGMs, and command/field GMs must clearly identify the punitive nature of the
      guidance, as required.
      5.6.6.3. The memorandum is valid for one year from the issued date. At the end of the
      one year period, the memorandum will “expire”; AFDPO will remove expired
      AFPMs/GMs from the e-Publishing web site and notify the OPR and PM of the action.
      5.6.6.4. OPRs must publish a new publication or change an existing one to reflect the
      policy or guidance provided in the memorandum. (T-1).
      5.6.6.5. OPRs may extend the effective period of a memorandum and reissue
      (recommend this be accomplished before the expiration date of the memorandum), by re-
      coordinating (as required) and obtaining certification and approval on a new AF Form
      673.
      5.6.6.6. OPRs should contact their publications managers for editable templates of
      AFPMs and GMs.
      5.6.6.7. AFPMs are AF level policy documents and are approved by the SECAF. OPRs
      develop the policy document to reflect changes to an existing AFPD or to create a new
      AFPD.
 52                                                AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


      5.6.6.8. GMs are guidance documents and are approved by appropriate approving
      officials at the organizational level at which the GM is issued (AF GMs are issued by
      HAF, AFMC GMs are issued by AFMC, etc.). OPRs develop the guidance document to
      reflect changes to an existing Instruction/Manual (AFI, AFMCI, etc.) or creation of a new
      Instruction/Manual.
      5.6.6.9. Required activities for an AFPM/GM:
          5.6.6.9.1. Draft and collaborate with PCM and/or SMEs.
          5.6.6.9.2. Legal Coordination (AF/JAA for AFPMs and AFGMs, Issuing
          organization’s legal office for subordinate GMs). (T-3).
          5.6.6.9.3. SAF/AA coordination for all AFPMs.
          5.6.6.9.4. Certifying Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-1).
          5.6.6.9.5. Approving Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-1).
          5.6.6.9.6. Submit to publications manager for final processing.
5.7. Transfer of Responsibility/Ownership of a Publication.
   5.7.1. Responsibility for a publication should be transferred when the current approving
   authority believes his/her office no longer has responsibility for the policy or guidance
   contained in the publication. In such cases, the approving authority should identify and
   obtain the concurrence of the proposed new approving authority for the publication.
   5.7.2. The losing office will staff a package to the gaining office to document
   acceptance/rejection of transfer. (T-3). The OPR may use standard staffing package (Task
   Management Tool (TMT), SSS, memo, etc.) or AF Form 673 to document the transfer.
   5.7.2. (934AW) The losing office will staff a package to the gaining office to document
   acceptance/rejection of transfer. The OPR shall use an AF Form 673 to document the transfer
   and retain all e-mails pertinent to the transfer as part of the official record set.
   5.7.3. Transfer of SECAF assigned responsibilities in HAF MDs or AFPDs must be
   approved by the SECAF. Change of certifying authority for an AFPD must be approved by
   the SECAF. Refer to AFI 90-101 and HOI 90-1 for detailed guidance on how to transfer
   responsibility for the DoD issuance.
   5.7.4. The completed transfer package will be submitted to the appropriate publications
   manager.
   5.7.5. Change Authoring OPR only. Changing the office that authors the publications or
   forms (authoring OPR) will be finalized by the certifying or approving official of the
   publication/form and reported to local PM/FMs. The affected publication/form must be
   updated as soon as possible to reflect the change. Use SSS, memo, or AF Form 673. No
   coordination outside of the organization is required.
   5.7.5. (934AW) Change Authoring OPR only. Changing the office that authors the
   publications or forms (authoring OPR) will be finalized by the certifying or approving
   official of the publication/form and reported to the local publications/forms managers. The
   affected publication/form must be updated within 180 days to reflect the change. The OPR
   shall use an AF Form 673 to document the transfer and retain all e-mails pertinent to the
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                               53


   transfer as part of the official record set. No coordination outside the organization is
   necessary.
   5.7.6. In addition to carrying out all reorganization/realignment responsibilities described in
   AFI 10-501, Program Action Directives (PAD), Program Guidance Letters (PGL), and
   Programming Plans (PPLAN), gaining OPRs for transferred publications will revise the
   publication to change the control number (if transferring to a different subject series),
   certifying and approving official information, and any other affected content. The record set
   for the publication being transferred must also be moved to the gaining OPR or PM/FM;
   accommodations for this action must be written into transfer agreements (PAD, PGL, etc.).
5.8. Obsolete Publications. A publication becomes obsolete when another publication
supersedes it, when the OPR rescinds it, or when AFDPO removes it from the publishing web
site because it is expired (as will be the case with AFPMs, GMs, VAs, and outdated
supplements)
   5.8.1. Rescission. OPR action to remove the publication from circulation without being
   replaced by another publication. OPRs planning to rescind a publication must complete
   coordination (T-3) in addition to obtaining certification and approval (T-1) using the AF
   Form 673.
      5.8.1.1. The OPR must submit the properly completed and signed AF Form 673 to the
      publications/ forms manager. Provide disposition instructions on the AF Form 673,
      following guidance in AFI 31-401 for classified publications.
      5.8.1.2. If the rescinded publication prescribes an AF form or a report, the OPR must
      include this information on the AF Form 673 and send a copy of the request for rescission
      to the information reports management and control office. Note: When a publication is
      rescinded, any prescribed forms or reports are rendered obsolete. Additionally, any
      implementing and/or supplementing publications must be reviewed for currency.
      5.8.1.3. If the publication is an AFPD or an AF supplement to a DoDD, only the SECAF
      may approve the rescission.
      5.8.1.4. If the publication implements a DoD Issuance, the OPR must clarify on the AF
      Form 673 that the requirements are no longer valid or are met in a separate, active
      publication (list publications, if applicable) and obtain SAF/AAII Policy Branch
      coordination in addition to other coordination.
      5.8.1.5. If no response is provided to a periodic or special review task, the publications
      manager may initiate a rescind action. The publications manager must staff an AF Form
      673 to the certifying and approving officials only to rescind the publication and all
      associated prescribed forms. If approved, the products will be removed from circulation
      and the associated AF Form 673 will be sent to the OPR for closeout of the record-set.
   5.8.2. Supersession. Action by which a new/revised publication is issued to replace the
   older version. Action to publish a new or revised publication includes the supersession
   action. The AF Form 673 identifies the publication in the “Superseded” block.
   5.8.3. Obsolete and Expired Publications.
      5.8.3.1. Obsolete publications/forms are removed from the active Product Index on the e-
      Publishing and other web sites. Links to obsolete publications are removed and AFDPO
54                                               AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


     releases a product announcement to notify subscribers of the cancellation. OPRs should
     notify affected staff offices when a publication is released, revised, or rescinded and
     posted on the e-Publishing web site. The OPR notice should include a statement alerting
     recipients that related publications and/or processes may be affected.
     5.8.3.2. Obsolete products (rescinded, superseded and expired) are listed (no link) in the
     Obsolete Product Index with reference to action taken and if applicable, link to
     superseding product.
     5.8.3.3. ANG notifies subscribers of cancellations, to all Publication Distribution Office
     accounts.
     5.8.3.4. When expired AFPMs and GMs, or outdated supplements are removed from the
     e-Publishing web site, they are considered cancelled. Forms prescribed by these
     publications and related visual aids become obsolete. Because no AF Form 673 is used in
     the removal, the record set for the publication should refer to the sections in this
     publication as justification for cancellation and “closeout” of the record.

                                            Chapter 6

                            DEVELOPING THE PUBLICATION

6.1. Overview. This chapter describes the structure and content requirements for specific
sections within a publication. Unique requirements for ICs and ACs are found in Chapter 5 and
requirements for VAs, Supplements, and AFPMs/GMs are found at the very end of this chapter.
Publications managers can provide templates to assist in building the publication.
6.2. Select/Confirm Subject Series and Number. Most Air Force publications are related to
an Air Force specialty code (AFSC); see Attachment 2 for series descriptions. Publications
managers can assist the POC in making this determination.
   6.2.1. All directive departmental publications that issue guidance (Instructions and Manuals)
   must have an antecedent AFPD. You must identify or discuss the antecedent AFPD when
   you request the publication number from your publications manager.
   6.2.2. If the publication is a rewrite, it typically bears the same series and control number as
   the superseded publication. Exception: Publications being realigned under different
   AFPDs, or consolidated, may have new series and control numbers.
   6.2.3. When publications ‘owned’ by different OPRs are combined, a statement of
   concurrence clearly designating the ‘owner’ of the consolidated publication will be required.
   The OPR of the new publication may base the publication number on one of the combined
   publications or request a new one. Also, implementing/supplementary publications must be
   updated by IC or revision to reflect the new publication number as appropriate.
   6.2.4. Request a publication number from the publications manager.
   6.2.5. The abbreviation of the highest overall security classification or CUI restriction within
   the publication or form shall be added to the end of the publication or form number: “-C” for
   Confidential, “-S” for Secret, and “-TS” for Top Secret; “-O” for FOUO.
6.3. Select/Create a Title. When developing a new publication, select a meaningful, concise
title.
   6.3.1. Do not use terms such as “policy,” “instruction,” “guidance,” “handbook,”
   “pamphlet,” “catalog,” “guide,” or “book,” etc., in the title of the publication. Additionally,
   there is no need to identify “Air Force” in the title since this is an AF publication.
   6.3.2. If supplementing a higher headquarters publication at the HAF, command, or in the
   field, maintain the title of the original publication, minus any organizational level identifiers
   (DoD, etc.).
   6.3.3. For classified (C, S, TS) publications and forms, the unclassified title will have “(U)”
   added to the end of the title. If the title is classified, the words “Classified Title (U)” will be
   used as the title.
6.4. Research and Develop the Policy or Guidance. Conduct research and collaborate with
SMEs. Utilize the most efficient means to collaborate.
6.5. Constructing the Draft.
56                                                 AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


  6.5.1. Not for Implementation. Drafts are for development and coordination only, not for
  implementation or compliance. Drafts may be circulated to inform users of forthcoming
  changes, but OPRs may never release draft content with instructions to comply. Users are not
  required to comply until content is certified, approved, and posted/released. Each draft must
  be marked “DRAFT—NOT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OR COMPLIANCE” across the top
  of each page (header). Note: Do not use watermarks, as this reduces the readability of the
  draft. (T-1).
  6.5.2. Reference the United States Government Printing Office (GPO) Style Manual
  (http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/index.html), Plain Writing Act of 2010, and DoDI
  5025.01 for additional guidance on writing style, grammar, formatting, etc.
  6.5.3. Structure content in publications in this order: publication header, opening paragraph;
  summary of changes (if applicable); table of contents (if applicable—see Paragraph 6.5.9);
  “overview” or “background”; detailed responsibilities; core content; attachments
  (Attachment 1 must be titled “Glossary of References and Supporting Information” and
  include a list of references cited, prescribed and adopted forms, definitions for abbreviations
  and acronyms used, and a description of terms used). (T-1).
  6.5.4. Create drafts using Microsoft Word® in 12-point Times New Roman font, with one-
  inch top, bottom, left, and right margins. Include page numbers on draft publications. See
  AFMAN 33-361 for guidance on formatting details and contact your publications manager
  for editable templates of publications. If doing a rewrite, the previous final draft is a good
  starting point (found in the official record set in your office file plan, or from your
  publications manager). (T-1).
  6.5.5. Publication’s Front Page Header. The following information must be included as
  part of the publication header (see the first page of this document as an example for content,
  not format). Publications not processed by AFDPO must be formatted by the OPR to look
  like an AFDPO formatted publication (camera ready – use this publication as a template).
  OPRs are required to use the information detailed below to create publications. Draft
  publications (both physical and electronic) that will be processed by AFDPO must contain
  the following information at the beginning of the document in this order, flush left, no tabs,
  and single spaced. (T-1).
     6.5.5.1. BY ORDER OF THE (SECAF/command/base/wing/etc.).
     6.5.5.2. The publication type and number (e.g. Air Force Instruction 33-360, Air Force
     Instruction 33-360_AMCSUP).
     6.5.5.3. Place holder for date (e.g., “(Date)”). The final publishing activity (AFDPO,
     local publication manager, or OPR) will date the publication the same day it is posted to
     the web site or made available for distribution. The publication date is the effective date;
     Air Force publications are not considered effective until they are released to users IAW
     this publication. With proper justification publications at any level may be assigned an
     “effective” date that falls in the future, but under no circumstances may publications be
     backdated.
     6.5.5.4. The AFSC series title, See Attachment 2.
     6.5.5.5. The publication title.
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                              57


       6.5.5.6. The compliance statement: “COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS
       MANDATORY” if a directive publication.
       6.5.5.7. An accessibility statement to identify where the publication is located for
       distribution. See Table 6.1 for examples of accessibility statements.

Table 6.1. Examples of Accessibility Statements.
“ACCESSIBILITY: Publications and forms are available for downloading or ordering on the e-
Publishing web site at www.e-Publishing.af.mil”
“ACCESSIBILITY: This publication is only available directly from the OPR”
“ACCESSIBILITY: This publication is available for downloading on the SIPRNet at
www.#######.af.smil.mil”
       6.5.5.8. A releasability statement, which should specify any limitations on distribution.
       See Table 6.2 for examples of releasability statements.

Table 6.2. Examples of Releasability Statements.
“RELEASABILITY: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication”
“RELEASABILITY: Access to this publication (or form) is restricted: this publication may be
released to NATO members only”
“RELEASABILITY: Access to this publication (or form) is restricted: this publication may not
be released to foreign nationals”
“RELEASABILITY: Access to this publication (or form) is restricted: this publication is
classified (or insert CUI type) requests for accessibility must be approved by the OPR”
“RELEASABILITY: Access to this publication (or form) is restricted”
       6.5.5.9. “OPR: (org/office symbol only)”.
       6.5.5.10. “Certified By: (insert org/office symbol and, in parenthesis, the certifier’s
       name that will appear on the AF Form 673).”
       6.5.5.11. “Supersedes: (include the number and date of all publications being
       superseded, separated by a semicolon),” if applicable.
       6.5.5.12. “Pages: (insert page count)”.
       6.5.5.13. AFDPO formatted Publications. The Air Force Seal or corresponding Shield of
       the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU where the publication is approved will be inserted during
       tagging—OPRs do not need to include the Seal or Shield in the draft publication. All
       departmental publications will display the Air Force Seal in the upper left corner of the
       first page, with “BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE” written
       above the Seal. Command/field publications will not use the Air Force Seal, unless
       issuing an integrated supplement to a departmental publication. All command/field
       publications, except integrated supplements to departmental publications, will display the
       appropriate MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Shield in the upper left corner of the first page, with
       “BY ORDER OF THE (MAJCOM/FOA/DRU) COMMANDER or DIRECTOR” written
       above the Shield. Note: MAJCOMs may approve subordinate field organizations to use
       their unique Shield on their site specific publications. However, MAJCOM Publication
58                                                 AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


     Managers must ensure an electronic copy of the approved Shield is provided to AFDPO
     for the publications they process.
  6.5.6. Opening Paragraph. Write a concise purpose statement for all categories of
  publications: explain what the publication covers, who must comply, and cite the antecedent
  publication(s). Do not include policy/guidance statements in the opening paragraph. If
  implementing a DoD issuance, show the type implemented after “DoD” (e.g., DoD Directive
  or DoD Instruction) and include the number and title. The opening paragraph shall include:
  (T-1).
     6.5.6.1. Implemented Policy/Guidance/HHQ Publication. The first sentence must
     identify the antecedent publication that is being implemented. Identify only those
     publications, which if changed, will require your publication to be reviewed for
     compliance/accuracy; other publications that are referenced within the document should
     be included in Attachment 1, not here.
     6.5.6.2. Applicability Statement. Identify any unique applicability conditions (signed
     MOA/U, Support Agreement, etc.). (T-1). Identify applicability to Air National Guard or
     Air Force Reserve.
     6.5.6.3. Legal Requirements Statement. If applicable, note that failure to comply with
     the publication is punishable as a violation of Article 92, of the UMCJ. Indicate if the
     publication is subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, subject to FOIA requirements, subject
     to Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, contains copyrighted information, or is subject to
     other statutory requirements. (T-1). See Paragraph 1.7 of this publication for guidance
     on obtaining sample statements and addressing legal issues in the opening paragraph of
     the publication. The servicing legal office should be participating early in the writing of a
     punitive statement.
     6.5.6.4. Records Management Statement. Include the standard records management
     statement: “Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
     publication are maintained IAW Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
     Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information Management System
     (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)”, or any updated statement provided by
     the AF Records Management office (SAF/CIO A6P). (T-1).
     6.5.6.5. Recommending Changes Statement. Include a statement for recommending
     changes, including any necessary routing instructions. (T-1). For example, “Refer
     recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
     Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
     Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain
     of command.”
     6.5.6.6. Allow Implementing/Supplementing Publications Statement.
         6.5.6.6.1. The OPR for the HHQ publication (parent) determines if implementing
         activities must create supplements or separate publications for their organization-
         specific guidance. Supplementary guidance (which includes supplements and separate
         publications) cannot be less restrictive than the parent publication, but it can be more
         restrictive. Supplementary guidance must not contradict the parent publication. (T-1).
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                             59


         6.5.6.6.2. Include a statement in the opening paragraph as to whether or not
         subordinate units must send implementing or supplementing publications to the
         higher headquarters authoring OPR for review and coordination before publishing.
         OPRs are highly encouraged to review lower-level supplements/implementing
         publications for conflicting material, less restrictive guidance, and for possible
         incorporation into the higher headquarters publication. Examples of statements
         include, “This publication may be supplemented at any level, but all direct
         Supplements must be routed to the OPR of this publication for coordination prior to
         certification and approval.” or “This publication may not be supplemented or further
         implemented/extended.”
     6.5.6.7. Waiver Authority Statement. Include a statement in the opening paragraph
     regarding waiver authority. Example: “The authorities to waive wing/unit level
     requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number
     following the compliance statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
     Management, for a description of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers.
     Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver
     approval authority, or alternately, to the Publication OPR for non-tiered compliance
     items” publications A reference to an internal paragraph that contains the authority and
     directions is also permitted.
     6.5.6.8. Trade Names and Trademarks. When using a trade name or mark of a non-
     Federal/government entity, include the following disclaimer as the last sentence in the
     publication’s opening paragraph: “The use of the name or mark of any specific
     manufacturer, commercial product, commodity, or service in this publication does not
     imply endorsement by the Air Force.” Refer to Paragraph 1.12.6 for additional guidance.
  6.5.7. Summary of Changes. A summary of changes shall be included for all ICs and
  rewritten publications only. The summary of changes will cite major changes: content
  changes; new, revised, or obsolete forms; new, revised, or rescinded recurring reports; etc.
  Place the summary of changes immediately after the opening paragraph. (T-1).
     6.5.7.1. Insert a statement that concisely summarizes the changes being made, “This
     document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major
     changes include (insert summary of major changes).”
     6.5.7.2. Include one of these statements as the last sentence when making an IC (not
     when issuing a rewrite): “A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.”, or “An
     asterisk (*) indicates newly revised material” for Supplements to DoD Issuances. Note:
     Do not include a summary of changes for ACs or new publications.
  6.5.8. Forewords. Only nondirective publications may have a foreword to provide a
  personal message from a proponent. Limit the foreword to one unnumbered page preceding
  the title (first) page. Signatures are not required on forewords. (T-1).
  6.5.9. Table of Contents. Tables of contents for electronic publications that are processed
  by AFDPO and posted on the e-Publishing web site will be generated by AFDPO for
  publications that are 20 pages or more; do not submit a table of contents as part of the draft
  publication unless the publication will be a physical/printed product. OPRs for publications
  not processed/tagged by AFDPO (classified, non-electronic printed, and those issued below
 60                                                  AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


   the wing/base, or by ANG wings/subunits) should add a table of contents for publications
   over 20 pages. Include chapter titles, section titles, sub-section titles as desired, titles for
   figures or tables that appear within chapters, and attachments titles, as well as page numbers
   for all. (T-1).
   6.5.10. Publication Body. When drafting new publications or revising existing ones,
   authors will follow the Federal Plain Language Guidelines available at
   http://www.plainlanguage.gov, as appropriate. Specialized language may be required
   depending on the intended audience, but language and content organization should be as
   clear as possible. Key concepts of plain language to keep in mind are noted in Table 6.3.

Table 6.3. Plain Language Concepts.
Be Clear      Use plain language whenever possible; avoid jargon

              Avoid overuse of acronyms (if used, make certain they are established upon first
              use)

              Use the active voice

              Format your documents so that it’s easy to read and understand

              Use table and figures if that’s the best way to show information
Be Concise    Remove unnecessary words

              Write sentences with 20 words or fewer and that contain a single thought, action,
              etc.

              Use seven sentences or fewer per paragraph
Be Specific   Include only information that the reader must know

              Use words with precise meaning

              Include details that are directly relevant to the main point
       6.5.10.1. Paragraph Numbering. Numerically number all paragraphs and subparagraphs,
       using this publication as a visual sample for paragraph numbering. AF Supplements to
       DoD Issuances will follow the numbering format of the supplemented DoD issuance.
       OPRs must provide fully integrated camera-ready copies of AF Supplements to DoD
       issuances to AFDPO for posting to the e-Publishing website. (T-1).
       6.5.10.2. Bullets.
           6.5.10.2.1. Directive Publications. Bullets are not authorized in directive type Air
           Force publications (see Table 4.1 for list of publications), including ICs. When
           updating an old publication with bulleted information, those items must be substituted
           with paragraph numbers (e.g. 2.14.1.1., 2.14.1.2., etc.). (T-1).
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                            61


        6.5.10.2.2. Non Directive Publications. When part of a numbered paragraph, bullets
        may be used for simple lists in nondirective type Air Force publications (AFPAM,
        DD, TTP, AFH, VA). Sub-bullets are not allowed.
     6.5.10.3. Embed figures and tables where they will appear in the final version. Provide a
     separate source graphic file for each figure not created in Word®. Place the number and
     title of each figure or table directly above the item in the publication. Limit the use of
     unnecessary color and graphics to help minimize printing costs and the size of
     transmitted and posted files. Work with your PM/FM to ensure your graphics are
     submitted properly.
     6.5.10.4. Overview/Background Section. (Optional) Provide a concise overview
     and/or background information.
     6.5.10.5. Policy Section (AFPDs only). (Required for AFPDs) Identify Air Force level
     policy that is consistent with laws, regulations, and leadership’s direction. The policy
     section states the principles and/or goals and may define performance standards and other
     means by which the Air Force can evaluate success in implementing the policy.
        6.5.10.5.1. Policy statements should be as concise as possible; however, they must be
        written in sufficient detail to ensure the policies are clearly articulated.
        6.5.10.5.2. DO NOT include responsibilities in the policy section. DO NOT include
        procedures in AFPDs. One typical result of an imprecise policy section is the
        improper embedding of responsibilities. As a result, critical responsibilities are not
        clearly assigned, which can lead to failure to perform them.
     6.5.10.6. Roles and Responsibilities Section. (Required).
        6.5.10.6.1. Identify the key officials who will carry out the policy or guidance and
        list the overarching duties and obligations of each. Always assign responsibilities to
        officials, NOT to their offices or organizations. In assigning responsibilities, be
        specific but succinct. DO NOT include procedures. State what the official is
        responsible for doing, not how the official should do it. By clearly aligning the
        responsibility with the official, the intent of the publication can be better
        accomplished.
        6.5.10.6.2. AFPDs. The SECAF assigns responsibilities, as applicable, to HAF two-
        letter/digit officials, MAJCOM Commanders, and/or AF Component Commanders.
        Assigning responsibilities below this level is discouraged given it may unnecessarily
        hamper the key officials in their efforts to efficiently manage their
        activities/responsibilities, and circumvents his/her authority.
     6.5.10.7. Core Content. Do not use “Core Content” as a section title – use a title
     describing the content being provided. Guidance and detailed procedures must be written
     using command/active voice without jargon and using plain language. Directions must
     be clear, understandable, measurable, and executable. The OPR may structure the content
     to increase understanding and usability by the target audience. See Figure 6.1 for
     approved publication elements (chapters, volumes, sections, etc.).

   6.5.11. Approving         Official’s       Authentication. The         approving      official’s
   authentication/signature block will be the last entry before the attachments. There will be no
   wet signatures on the publication; the Approving Official’s signature is captured on the AF
   Form 673. If the authority to sign the AF Form 673 is delegated, the authentication on the
   actual publication remains that of the principal that delegated the authority. (T-1).
   6.5.12. Attachments. (T-1).
       6.5.12.1. Attachment 1, GLOSSARY OF REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING
       INFORMATION. OPRs must include an Attachment 1 that lists the references, forms,
       abbreviations and acronyms, and terms used within the publication. Do not use
       paragraph numbering for this attachment. Use the following section titles:
          6.5.12.1.1. References. Format: Designator (abbreviation), number, title (italicized),
          and published date. Recommend the references be listed in the order they appear in
          the text.
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                              63


          6.5.12.1.2. Prescribed Forms. List forms for which this is the parent publication.
          Format: Designator (abbreviation), number, title (italicized).
          6.5.12.1.3. Adopted Forms. List forms adopted by this publication.            Format:
          Designator (abbreviation), number, title (italicized).
          6.5.12.1.4. Abbreviations and Acronyms. List abbreviations and acronyms used
          within the publication alphabetically. Abbreviations and acronyms are spelled out
          upon first use or single use within the text and then incorporated into Attachment 1.
          6.5.12.1.5. Terms. Define terms used within the publication. List alphabetically.
      6.5.12.2. Additional Attachments. Include additional attachments as necessary. Use
      Arabic numerals in sequence: Attachment 2, Attachment 3, Attachment 4, etc. Paragraphs
      in attachments will take the first number from the number of the attachment; e.g.,
      Attachment 3 would have paragraph A3.1, A3.2, A3.3, etc. Note: If attachments have
      sections, identify them as sections A1A, A1B, A1C, or A2B, A2C, etc.
6.6. General Rules.
   6.6.1. Citing References. See Attachment 4 for sample citation styles and formats. (T-1).
      6.6.1.1. Limit the use of references and ensure all references are directly applicable and
      listed in Attachment 1. Do not use indefinite references such as “in current directives,”
      “contained in existing instructions,” and “as prescribed in pertinent publications.”
      Official Air Force policy and/or guidance are issued in the publications described in
      Table 4.1 and Table 4.2. Therefore, do not reference the following: a draft publication;
      unofficial policy and/or guidance found on web sites; or classified information in an
      unclassified publication.
      6.6.1.2. When Executive Orders (EOs), Public Laws, or other statutes have already been
      implemented by a DoD Issuance, use the DoD Issuance as the reference citation; e.g., use
      “DoDD 5400.7” rather than “Title 5 United States Code Section 552.” Note: “DoD
      Issuances” include DoDDs, DoDIs, other DoD publications, and their changes. However,
      when an Air Force publication directly implements a specific statute, you must cite it
      accordingly. Use codified citations (United States Code) when available, and if the
      provision is not codified, use the Public Law citation; e.g., use Public Law 98-191, or
      Title 41 United States Code Sections 401-420. Verify proper statutory authority with the
      servicing legal office during coordination of the publication.
      6.6.1.3. Do not reference a DoD Issuance in an Air Force publication unless there is no
      Air Force implementing publication. Use the Issuances, Delegations of Authority, and
      Responsibilities (IDAR) Database (www.idar.hq.af.mil) to determine which Air Force
      publications implement a given DoD Issuance. If no Air Force publication exists, cite the
      DoD Issuance number and include the full reference in Attachment 1 (designator,
      number, title, and date). Citing references at the appropriate level reduces confusion and
      conflicts. For example, AFPDs implement DoDDs, so if the AFPD is cited as being
      implemented there is no need to cite the DoDD. The AFPD may provide more restrictive
      policy than the DoDD, therefore citing the higher-level document could cause
      confusion/conflicts. The same applies for DoDIs and AFIs.

     6.6.1.4. To refer to another Air Force publication and/or form, cite the designator,
     number, and include the title in italics at first use (e.g., AFI 33-322, Records
     Management Program;; AF Form 673, Air Force Publication/Form Action Request).
     Thereafter, refer only to the designator and number (e.g., AFI 33-322 or AF Form 673).
     Include the full publication reference (designator, number, title, and date) in Attachment
     1.
  6.6.2. Notes. (T-1).
     6.6.2.1. OPRs may use “notes” within a paragraph to explain or highlight information.
     The word “Note” should be in bold followed by a colon (e.g., Note: [insert additional
     text]). Notes associated with tables, figures, or illustrations should be placed immediately
     below the graphic or, in the case of a table, in the last row of the table.
     6.6.2.2. Use footnotes or endnotes to credit a lengthy legal cite, a copyright owner, the
     source of quoted materials, or provide a lengthy explanation/expansion on text within a
     paragraph. Endnotes must be placed before any attachments to the publication.
  6.6.3. Exceptions. OPRs may identify “exceptions” within a paragraph to identify a case in
  which the cited rule does not apply. The word “Exception” should be in bold followed by a
  colon (e.g., Exception: [insert additional text]). Exceptions associated with tables, figures, or
  illustrations should be placed immediately below the graphic or, in the case of a table, in the
  last row of the table. (T-1).
  6.6.4. Using Figures (Illustrations).
     6.6.4.1. Requirements of Government Printing and Binding Regulations are as follows:
     Use illustrations only when they relate to Air Force business and are in the public
     interest, relate directly to the subject matter, are in good taste, and are the smallest size
     necessary. Limit the use of color, especially when developing a publication that will be
     printed, to control the cost. Use of color on printed materials must be justified on the AF
     Form 673. (T-1).
     6.6.4.2. Embed figures, tables not created in Word®, and illustrations where they will
     appear in the final version. Place the caption above the graphic. Provide a separate source
     graphic file for each figure, table, or illustration not created in Word® (e.g., .tif, .gif, .jpg,
     etc.), when submitting your publication for processing/posting. (T-1). Work with your
     PM/FM to ensure your graphics are submitted properly.
  6.6.5. Tables. Use tables to clarify procedures, present data, and/or to explain a choice of
  actions or set of conditions.
     6.6.5.1. A standard table is data arranged in columns. The listed items are organized by
     some criterion such as alphabetical or numerical order. The format requirements for
     standard tables are not rigid; many variations are possible, depending on the kind of
     material you wish to place in a table. Regardless of the variation used, columns and rows
     should be labeled (titles, numbers, letters, etc.) to facilitate referencing material in the
     table. Tables found in Attachment 2 and Attachment 3 of this publication are examples
     of standard tables.
     6.6.5.2. A decision logic table (DLT) is most useful when you need to explain a set of
     actions that depend on a condition or set of conditions; or when a narrative description of
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                              65


      possible actions would be complex or wordy. There are three elements in DLTs:
      conditions, actions, and requirements. The conditions (the ifs in the if-then relationship)
      are the potential circumstances that influence decisions. The actions (the thens in the if-
      then relationship) are the specific operations or tasks that must be performed when the
      various conditions occur. The requirements are the combined conditions and actions that
      make up decisions (if + then = requirement). Each separate condition and action must
      have its own requirement. Table A3.1 in this publication is an example of a DLT.
      6.6.5.3. A specified action table (SAT) shows actions that are usually taken in a certain
      order but that do not depend on any condition. If you just want to show a series of related
      actions or procedures, use a SAT. Table A3.2 in this publication is an example of a SAT.
   6.6.6. Tier Waiver Authority. Each unit (wing, or equivalent, and below; DRU; FOA)
   compliance item will be identified with a Tier waiver authority number using Table 1.1. (T-
   1). Exception: Publications that are issued/approved below the T-3 level
   (Wing/DRU/FOA/CC) do not require tiering.
6.7. Supplements.
   6.7.1. AF Supplements to DoD Issuances.
      6.7.1.1. To create an integrated supplement, the AF OPR must contact the OSD OPR to
      obtain an editable version of the DoD publication. The AF OPR then manually inserts the
      AF added paragraphs/material into a Word® or PDF version of the published DoDD,
      DoDI, or DoDM.
      6.7.1.2. The first added page(s) of an AF Supplement will include a publication header
      (Paragraph 6.5.5), opening paragraph (Paragraph 6.5.6), and summary of changes (if
      applicable) (Paragraph 6.5.7).
      6.7.1.3. OPRs must insert “(Added)(AF)” between each new paragraph number and the
      content (e.g., “4.1.1. (Added)(AF)”) when supplementing a DoD Issuance. Paragraph
      numbering will follow the existing schema used in the DoD Issuance. Air Force content
      will not be inserted into or between sentences of the parent DoD Issuance text, new
      “(Added)(AF)” paragraphs must be used.
      6.7.1.4. The AF approving authority’s authentication will be inserted after the OSD
      official’s authentication.
      6.7.1.5. For standalone supplements, the OPRs will submit only the AF added material.
      6.7.1.6. The OPR will provide a fully formatted document for publishing.
   6.7.2. Command/Field Supplements to AF Supplements to DoD Issuances: (T-1).
      6.7.2.1. To create an integrated supplement, the OPR must contact the OPR of the AF
      Supplement to obtain an editable version of the publication. The OPR then manually
      inserts the added material into a Word® or PDF version of the published AF Supplement
      to the DoDD, DoDI, or DoDM.
      6.7.2.2. OPRs must insert “(Added)” and the command/field acronym between each new
      number and the content (e.g., “4.1.1. (Added)(AMC)”) when supplementing an AF
      Supplement to a DoD Issuance. Paragraph numbering will follow the existing schema
      used in the DoD Issuance.
66                                                 AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


     6.7.2.3. The command/field approving authority’s authentication will be inserted after
     the OSD official’s/AF official’s authentication.
     6.7.2.4. For standalone supplements, the OPRs will submit only the added material.
     6.7.2.5. The OPR will provide a fully formatted document for publishing.
  6.7.3. Command/Field Supplements to AF Publications (AFIs, AFMANs, etc.): (T-1).
     6.7.3.1. OPRs will submit only the material to be added to the higher headquarters
     publication including the paragraph numbers whether creating a standalone or integrated
     supplement. AFDPO will insert the new material and the unit acronym into the higher
     headquarters publication for integrated supplements, and provide the OPR a copy of the
     final product.
     6.7.3.2. OPRs must insert “Added” between each new paragraph, figure, table,
     attachment number, etc., and the content (e.g., “4.1.1. (Added)”). The formatting
     software adds the appropriate command/field acronym after “(Added)”.
     6.7.3.3. OPRs do not use the “Added” tag when the paragraph, figure, table, attachment,
     etc., number already exists in the basic publication. Repeat the number of the entity
     being supplemented;; when the correct acronym is inserted during processing, the whole
     phrase “4.1.1. (AMC)” is considered a unique identifier even though the numerical digits
     exactly match the paragraph number being supplemented. Numbering must agree with
     the format in the basic publication; e.g., publications with chapters: Figure 2.1, Table 3.1,
     etc.; without chapters: Figure 1, Table 1, etc.
6.8. Air Force Policy Memorandum (AFPM) and Guidance Memorandum (GM).
  6.8.1. OPRs writing an AFPM or GM will format the document using publications manager
  provided templates. AFPMs and GMs will indicate in the subject line whether it is an Air
  Force Policy Memorandum or Guidance Memorandum. OPRs request AFPM and GM
  control numbers from publication managers and place it above the date slot. The actual date
  on the AFPM or GM is inserted at the time of publication by the publishing authority. If
  issuing new policy or guidance, include a releasability statement, applicability statement, the
  standard records management statement and any other applicable standard statements
  described in Paragraph 6.5 above. Note: Do not have the principal sign the memorandum;
  insert only an authentication/signature block just like any other publication. The completed
  AF Form 673 serves as the approval to publish. (T-1).
  6.8.2. All memoranda shall start with a “By Order of” statement. AFPMs and GMs shall
  start with “By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force.” Command and Field GMs will be by
  order of the issuing commander/director (“By Order of the Commander, Air Combat
  Command”). (T-1).
  6.8.3. If issuing an AFPM or a GM (HAF, command, or field level) that amends an existing
  publication, insert the following standard statement in the opening statement: “By Order of
  the Secretary of the Air Force (or the issuing organizations commander/director), this
  (Guidance or Policy) Memorandum immediately implements changes to (specify the
  publication and include a short description of the policy/guidance being changed).
  Compliance with this memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                                 67


   with other Air Force (or the issuing organization’s [ACC, 319 ARW, etc.]) publications, the
   information herein prevails IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.”.”
   6.8.4. AFPMs and all GMs (HAF, command, and field level) will end with the following
   statement: “This memorandum becomes void after one-year has elapsed from the date of this
   memorandum, or upon publication of an Interim Change or rewrite of the affected
   publication, whichever is earlier.” (T-1).
   6.8.5. Reissuing AFPMs/GMs. AFPMs and GMs may be reissued for an additional period
   of up to one-year if the policy/guidance has not been incorporated into an official publication
   within the timeframe allowed. OPRs shall use an AF Form 673, obtaining legal review (T-
   3), signatures of certifying and approving officials (T-1) for subsequent reissue/extension.
   The OPR will forward the AFPM or GM and completed AF Form 673 to AFDPO for
   dating/posting.
6.9. Visual Aids. VAs have unique formats. However, they are numbered like
instructions/manuals (series & control number), and identify the attributed directive publication, ,
a releasability statement (no need for an accessibility statement), and a supersession line on
permanent VAs; this information should be placed at the bottom right of the VA if space allows.
In some cases, placement of this information will be impossible due to small size of the VA;
OPRs should try to design VAs to include this information unless doing so is impractical. (T-1).
6.10. Standalone Base/Wing Level Publications.
   6.10.1. If a wing/base decides to issue standalone publications (those that will not be
   integrated into HHQ publications (Supplements) or formatted by AFDPO (types listed in
   Table 4.1 and Table 4.2)), then the wing/base must provide a properly formatted/camera-
   ready version to AFDPO for posting. (T-3). AFDPO will not format (tag) the publication
   given that it will not require integration into higher or lower level publications. AFDPO will
   apply the effective date and post the publication to the e-Publishing web site.
   6.10.2. OPRs at the wing/base become responsible for providing any future updates to their
   standalone publications in the same fully-formatted, integrated, and camera-ready condition.
   OPRs must integrate ICs and attach any AC or GM to their publications before submitting
   them for publishing.

                                          Chapter 7

                                FORMAL COORDINATION

7.1. Coordination. Coordination is a process in which an OPR obtains endorsements to publish
from offices with functional interest/technical expertise, oversight responsibilities,
statutory/regulatory review requirements, and is completed prior to obtaining certifying and
approving officials’ signatures on the AF Form 673. (T-3).
   7.1.1. Commanders/Directors, through their PCMs, will determine the appropriate
   offices/organizations from which coordination should be obtained for a                   draft
   publication/form, prior to certification and/or approval. Table A3.1 can be used as a starting
   point in determining appropriate coordination. The table is not all-inclusive; but, provides
   recommended coordinating offices for the subject areas identified. Directive publications
   should be coordinated with all offices having functional interest/technical expertise,
   oversight responsibilities, statutory/regulatory review requirements, even if they do not
   appear in the table.
   7.1.1. (934AW) A completed AF Form 673 must accompany the draft submitted for
   publication. Coordination will be obtained using a consolidated e-mail thread or an approved
   automated tasking tool. Every effort will be made to obtain coordination using electronic
   signatures to ensure compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and Executive
   Order 13589, Promoting Efficient Spending. Functional coordination should be completed
   and accepted, recommended changes incorporated into the draft before the “final” version is
   submitted for mandatory coordination. The OPR cannot release any final drafts for
   publication with unresolved nonconcurrences or insufficient coordination.
   7.1.2. If the OPR does not obtain coordination from an affected office, the OPR may be
   required to do an immediate update if language in the publication is contested by an office
   that was not given the opportunity to coordinate. If resolution cannot be reached at the OPR
   level, the OPR must grant a waiver to the affected office absolving them from complying
   with the contested language until the issue is resolved. The OPR will involve the servicing
   legal office and elevate within the chain of command as necessary to resolve contested
   guidance. If the contested language is dictated in a DoD issuance, the Air Force OPR cannot
   waive the DoD requirement. The office contesting the DoD guidance will need to work with
   the Air Force OPR for the DoD issuance (see IDAR database for OPR listing -
   https://www.idar.hq.af.mil) to obtain a waiver or change the DoD guidance; send a courtesy
   copy of all e-mail correspondences between the Air Force OPR and the DoD OPR to the
   SAF/AAII Policy Branch workflow box (saf.aaii.policy@pentagon.af.mil).
   7.1.3. A completed AF Form 673 must accompany the final draft submitted for publication,
   although OPRs may collect coordination endorsements from e-mail, an AF Form 1768
   (SSS), eSSS in TMT, or the AF Form 673 (electronic or pen-and-ink signatures are
   acceptable) for draft publications. (T-1). If signatures are obtained simultaneously (i.e.,
   “shotgunned”), or on separate/different documents, transcribe the information onto the AF
   Form 673 and maintain original correspondence with signatures in the record. The OPR must
   not release any final drafts for publication with unresolved nonconcurrences or insufficient
   coordination.
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                                   69


      7.1.4. Coordination standards and requirements for coordinating classified and CUI
      publications and forms are the same as those for unclassified publications/forms. Contact
      coordinating offices for instructions on routing sensitive/CUI and classified publications
      7.1.5. AFPMs and GMs require immediate release because they address critical issues, they
      only require a legal review1 (T-3),), and signatures of certifying and approving officials (T-1)
      (the SECAF for AFPMs) on the AF Form 673. OPRs must provide full justification for
      issuing this time sensitive policy/guidance on the AF Form 673 or staff package. (T-3).
      7.1.6. OPRs/POCs of publication actions, which, as a result of coordination, incorporate
      substantive or critical comments into the coordinated publication draft, must obtain a legal
      sufficiency review of the “final” product by the supporting legal office prior to forwarding
      for certifying and approval authority action.
7.2. Suspense. OPRs must establish a reasonable suspense that reflects the complexity and size
of the publication being coordinated. Coordinators should be given a minimum of two weeks to
provide coordination.
      7.2.1. If coordinating offices are unable to meet a suspense date, requests for extensions
      must be submitted to the OPR prior to the given suspense date. A request for extension must
      include rationale and estimated completion date. The publication OPR must make a good
      faith effort to allow reasonable time for the office to respond based on the rationale provided.
      See Paragraph 7.4.3 for additional guidance on missed suspense.
          7.2.1.1. (Added-934AW) OPRs are responsible for selecting technical and functional
          coordinators and obtaining technical/functional coordination prior to sending to
          mandatory coordinators.
      7.2.2. OPRs should allow at least thirty days for AFRC units and ANG wings/subunits to
      respond when coordinating on publications issued below the AF/MAJCOM level.
          7.2.2.1. (Added-934AW) Mandatory coordination requirements for 934 AW OIs are the
          same as the requirements for any other 934 AW publication, with the exception of 934
          Group Commanders. The Group commander for that particular Group will be the
          approving official for the OI. For example, the only Group Commander to approve an
          MXG OI will be the MXG/CC. No other Group Commander’s coordination is necessary.
7.3. Comment Matrix. OPRs will provide coordinators with a comment matrix for providing
feedback. The comment matrix will include columns for the following elements: organization,
item number, type of comment (Administrative, Substantive, or Critical—include a legend at the
bottom of the matrix), page number, paragraph number, comment, and rationale. Regardless of
the type of coordination comment, coordinators must designate a POC to work with the OPR
towards resolution. The POC designated by the reviewer may not be a contractor or an indirect-
hire foreign national. Coordinators must specify one of the following types of comments for each
comment provided in a standard comment matrix. (T-3).
      7.3.1. Administrative comments address typographical, grammatical, and formatting errors.
      7.3.2. Substantive comments address content that appears to be unnecessary, incorrect,
      misleading, confusing, or inconsistent. A substantive comment is usually not sufficient

   justification for a nonconcur. Several substantive comments, when taken together, may be
   grounds for a nonconcurrence.
   7.3.3. Critical comments are warranted for major deficiencies and will preclude final
   approval and publication (i.e., result in a nonconcur). Critical comments are those that
   identify violations of the law or contradictions of policy, unnecessary risks to safety, life,
   limb, or AF materiel; waste or abuse of AF appropriations; imposition of an unreasonable
   burden on AF resources; and similar issues.
7.4. Types of Coordination Responses.
   7.4.1. Concur Without Comment.
   7.4.2. Concur With Comment. Comments are administrative or substantive and consist of
   changes meant to improve the clarity and correctness of an issuance. Critical comments shall
   not be included in a “Concur With Comment” response.
   7.4.3. Concur-No Response. A coordinator has not requested an extension or responded to a
   request for coordination within the allotted coordination suspense period.
       7.4.3.1. OPR must have provided a reasonable suspense and make a good faith effort to
       determine why the coordinator has not responded. This effort shall include requesting the
       assistance of the organization’s PCM or publications management office or contacting
       the coordinator SME for the publication, if known. The number of contacts will depend
       upon the urgency of the publication action. (T-3).
       7.4.3.2. The OPR shall continue with the approval process and shall enter “Concur-No
       Response” next to the coordinator on the list of coordinating officials and explain in the
       staff package why it is appropriate for the signature authority to release the publication
       without the coordinator’s response. (T-3).
   7.4.4. Nonconcur. Comments may be a combination of substantive and critical. They shall
   be labeled and grouped accordingly so critical comments are easily distinguished.
   Coordinators shall specify which comments (other than critical) are grounds for the non-
   concurrence.
   7.4.5. No Comment. A coordinator responds to a request for coordination but does not
   concur, nonconcur, or comment. This response signifies the coordinator has reviewed the
   issuance and does not have an equity interest in it.
7.5. What does Concurrence Mean? In providing concurrence, coordinators agree to the
contents within a publication or form from a functional perspective. Additionally,
coordinators are agreeing to the releasability of the publication, as stated by the OPR in the
publication. If the contents or purpose of a publication or a form are in conflict with existing
policy or guidance, or if the releasability as stated in the publication is not in keeping with
guidance in AFI 31-401, coordinators must provide feedback to the OPR accordingly.
7.6. Resolving Comments. OPRs must resolve all comments before submitting the publication
or form for final processing and publishing. The OPR is not required to resubmit/follow-up with
the coordinator to resolve administrative and/or substantive comments for “Concur With
Comment”. (T-3). A record of the resolution of comments must be included in the record set for
the publication/form. (T-1). Recommend the OPR make a copy of resolved comments available
for viewing on collaborative websites. Resolving Non-Concurrences:
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                               71


  7.6.1. Critical and some substantive comments result in a non-concurrence and shall be
  resolved between the concerned parties before a publication is approved and published.
  7.6.2. The resolution process is the responsibility of the publications OPR, including the
  manner in which conducted. The process may consist of informal or formal exchanges by
  phone, e-mail, and/or memo; meetings and working groups. If the OPR is unable to resolve
  the comments, they shall elevate the issues within their chain of command (see Paragraph
  7.6.4 for departmental publications) for resolution. Note: The OPR must stay involved in the
  process even if elevated to a higher authority.
  7.6.3. Resolution of a non-concurrence shall be documented by the coordinating office’s
  written withdrawal of the non-concurrence, signed at the same or higher level as the original
  coordination, or as delegated in the original coordination response. Exception: When the
  comments leading to the non-concurrence are accepted in full and incorporated into the
  publication, no withdrawal of the non-concurrence is required.
  7.6.4. Departmental level publications.
     7.6.4.1. When certifying and approving officials are within the same HAF two-letter
     organization, the approving official makes final decisions on resolution during impasses.
     Follow procedures in Paragraph 7.6.6 below.
     7.6.4.2. When certifying and approving officials are not within the same HAF two-letter
     organization, the certifying authority that has been given policy oversight by the SECAF
     in the antecedent AFPD makes final decisions to resolve impasses.
         7.6.4.2.1. If the OPR cannot resolve the coordinator’s comment, they will work
         through their chains of command and elevate to the approving authority for resolution
         if necessary.
         7.6.4.2.2. If the non-concur is from the certifying official, the publication will not be
         published until the certifying authority withdraws the non-concur.

         documentation, to the appropriate authority. Both sides of the comments/impasse
         shall be clearly and succinctly addressed in the document along with a
         recommendation. Note: The documentation becomes part of the permanent record-
         set of the publication.
  7.6.5. Command/Field level publications. The approving official makes final decisions on
  resolution during impasses. (Note: When impasses involve a command/field supplement and
  the HHQ guidance being supplemented, the approving official for the HHQ publication is the
  resolving authority).
  7.6.6. If the OPR is unable to resolve a non-concurrence after going through their chain of
  command and involving the certifying official, the impasse shall be addressed in a
  memorandum, or other written documentation, to the approving official requesting the AF

                            CERTIFICATION AND APPROVAL

8.1. Certification.
   8.1.1. “Certification” is the act of endorsing the need for the publication within the
   numbered publication subject series, and, if applicable, verifying consistency with AF policy
   and assigned responsibilities in HAF MD, antecedent AFPD and/or implemented higher
   headquarter publication.
   8.1.2. Once the required coordination is complete, the OPR obtains certification.
   8.1.3. Certifying Official.
       8.1.3.1. Departmental Level (HAF).
           8.1.3.1.1. The certifying official is a HAF two-letter/digit official that is responsible
           for a specific numbered publication series (refer to Attachment 2), policy
           development and implementation, and oversight of implementing guidance and
           procedural publications. For example, the AF/A1 is the lead for Personnel matters as
           delegated in HAF MD 11-32, DCS, Manpower, Personnel and Services, and develops
           personnel policy, in coordination with Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for
           Manpower and reserve Affairs (SAF/MR), in a 36-series AFPD. The AF/A1 certifies
           the AFPD and the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) approves. All departmental
           publications that implement the AFPD will then be certified by the AF/A1, although
           the implementing departmental publications may be authored and/or approved by a
           different HAF two-letter/digit that has been given responsibility/authority in the
           antecedent AFPD or AF/A1 approved AFI/AFMAN to provide specific personnel
           guidance for their functional area.              AF/A1 exercises oversight of
           authority/responsibility given in HAF MD 1-32 and specific AFPDs through
           certification of those implementing 36-series publications which are approved by
           other HAF two-letter/digits. In cases where the certifying official is also the
           approving official, the publications certifying task should be accomplished by an
           official below the level of the approving official and above the authoring OPR.
           Exception: Certification of Doctrine is IAW AFI 10-1301, Air Force Doctrine.
           8.1.3.1.2. Refer to Attachment 2 for the list of numbered publication series and the
           appropriate certifying official. Designations are based on assigned responsibilities for
           functional area as delegated in HAF mission directives and/or AF policy directives.
           8.1.3.1.3. All departmental level publications/forms, and actions that change them,
           must be certified by officials at the HAF level.
       8.1.3.2. Command/Field Level Publications/Forms (MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, Wing,
       etc.). The certifying official should be one level above the authoring OPR if possible. If
       the official one level above the OPR is the approval authority, the director/head of the
       authoring OPR or the approval authority may serve as the certifying official. (T-1).
   8.1.4. OPR uses appropriate staffing vehicle (SSS, TMT, etc.) to obtain certifying official’s
   manual or digital signature on the AF Form 673.
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                              73


   8.1.4. (934AW) OPR uses appropriate staffing vehicle (TMT, e-mail, etc.) to obtain
   certifying official’s digital signature on AF Form 673.
   8.1.5. If coordination is more than one year old and no significant changes to the draft
   contents have been made, OPRs must state on the AF Form 673 that no re-coordination is
   necessary before the certifying official signs the form. The OPR is responsible for re-
   accomplishing coordination as necessary. (T-3).
8.2. Approval.
   8.2.1. Act of approving the release of publications for compliance and enforcement that are
   necessary, attesting to currency of information, and consistency with existing laws, policy,
   guidance and Air Force Mission. See Paragraph 2.17 for additional details.
   8.2.2. Once certification is completed the OPR obtains approval.
   8.2.3. Approving Official.
      8.2.3.1. The SECAF approves all AFPDs, AF Supplement to DoDDs, and AFPMs.
      8.2.3.2. Departmental Level (excluding AFPDs, AF Supplement to DoDDs, AFPMs).
      Heads of HAF two-letter/digit offices, or in their absence, acting heads of HAF two-
      letter/digit offices, or their two-letter/digit deputy/assistant.
      8.2.3.3. At MAJCOMs these are heads of functional two-letter/digit offices, or in their
      absence, acting heads of two-letter/digit offices, or their deputy heads. Exception:
      MAJCOM Commanders may move approval authority up to their level through a
      Supplement to this publication.
      8.2.3.4. Below the HAF and MAJCOM level, these are commanders/directors (acting
      commanders/directors, or deputy commanders/directors, if the commander/director is
      unable to provide approval) who are responsible for guidance/procedures pertaining to
      activities under their command/direction. (T-1).
      8.2.3.5. Approval of Doctrine is IAW AFI 10-1301.
   8.2.4. The OPR uses appropriate staffing vehicle (SSS, e-mail, etc.) to obtain approving
   official’s manual or digital signature on the AF Form 673.
   8.2.4. (934AW) OPR uses appropriate staffing vehicle (TMT, e-mail, etc.) to obtain
   approving official’s digital signature on AF Form 673.
   8.2.5. If authority has been delegated to sign the AF Form 673 pursuant to Paragraph
   2.11.6, the delegation letter must be on file with the appropriate publications manager or you
   must attach a copy to the final package.
   8.2.6. If coordination is more than one year old and no significant changes to the draft
   contents have been made, OPRs must state on the AF Form 673 that no re-coordination is
   necessary before the approving official signs the form. If significant changes have been
   made, the OPR is responsible for re-accomplishing necessary coordination. (T-3).
   8.2.7. All departmental level publications/forms, and actions that change them, must be
   approved by officials at the HAF level.

                                       RECORDS MANAGEMENT

10.1. Creation of Records. The execution of processes and procedures prescribed in
publications results in the creation of records that document the business of the Air Force.
      10.1.1. OPRs must ensure the RDS2 accurately reflects disposition of all records created and
      collected as a result of compliance with the publications they author. (T-1). Contact your
      local records manager/professional for assistance early to avoid delays in publishing.
      10.1.2. If discrepancies exist in the RDS, OPRs must follow instructions in AFI 33-364,
      Records Disposition-Procedures and Responsibilities, and AFMAN 33-363 to update the
      RDS.
      10.1.3. As part of formal coordination, the local records manager will check the processes
      prescribed in the publication against the RDS. (T-3). If the RDS requires modification,
      coordination may be delayed.
10.2. The Publication/Form Record Set. As OPRs develop or revise publications or forms,
they must ensure the records that facilitated the approval of the official Air Force policy or
guidance are retained. Electronic records will be used where approved by records
managers/professionals. Maintaining an accurate set of records that reflects the actions taken is a
responsibility mandated in Title 44 U.S.C. § 3101. (T-0).
      10.2.1. The record set for a publication must be maintained in a separate file from the record
      set for the prescribed form(s). Additionally, if preferable, record sets for previous versions of
      a publication may be retired.
      10.2.2. Those responsible for maintaining records sets must follow guidance in AFI 33-364;
      AFMAN 33-363; and AFI 33-322 for making, maintaining, and disposing of records.
           10.2.2.1. OPRs at the HAF who develop publications are responsible for maintaining the
           official record sets. OPR status may be delegated to the respective DRU/FOA.
           10.2.2.2. Command/Field PM/FM, in conjunction with the senior communications and
           information/knowledge operations manager, will determine who will maintain record sets
           locally. (T-3).
           10.2.2.2. (934AW) 934 CS/SCOK will maintain record sets for all 934 AW publications
           except OIs. POCs will maintain the record sets of OIs.
           10.2.2.3. OPRs for departmental publications that are authored by commands or in the
           field must maintain the record set for that publication IAW local guidance from their
           PM/FM.
      10.2.3. Maintain a file arranged numerically by subject series for each publication and form
      that includes the following:
           10.2.3.1. Records for AFPMs and GMs are maintained as publications. Those that are
           converted into “permanent” publications must become part of the record set for the

     permanent publication. AFPMs and GMs that are not converted into permanent
     publications are still maintained in the same way as other publications.
     10.2.3.2. The original AF Form 673. AFDPO will maintain a working copy of the AF
     Form 673 for publications developed at the HAF (includes both the Air Staff and the
     Secretariat) for their own records; OPRs for departmental publications and forms
     generated at the HAF are responsible for maintaining the official record sets.
     Command/Field OPRs developing departmental publications must maintain and/or retire
     the original AF Form 673 in the record set IAW local guidance from the PM/FM. When a
     publication and form(s) are circulated for coordination/action on the same AF Form 673
     or AF Form 1768 (SSS), keep the original in the publication record set and a copy of that
     record in the form record set.
     10.2.3.3. Publications: A copy of the published version of the publication with all
     revisions (ICs, ACs, AFPM/GMs) Note: Rescinded, superseded, or obsolete versions will
     be placed in inactive files and disposed of IAW the RDS and AFI 33-364.
     10.2.3.4. Forms: A copy of each published version of the form.
     10.2.3.5. All documents that show coordination, comments, and other actions, such as
     changes (ICs, ACs, form revisions, and rewrites), exemptions, waivers, suggestions, etc.,
     for the publication.
     10.2.3.6. Copies of form-related waivers granted and system form approvals (see
     Paragraph 12.7.5).
     10.2.3.7. A copy of each AF Form 673 and/or AF Form 399 used during periodic and
     special reviews for the publication or form.
     10.2.3.8. Any additional forms required to process the publication (such as forms
     required when developing a printed product, [DD 67, Form Processing Action Request],
     if making changes to a DoD form).

                                           Chapter 11

                             PUBLICATIONS MANAGEMENT

11.1. Issuing Publication Numbers.
   11.1.1. If the publication is a rewrite, it typically bears the same series and control number as
   the superseded publication. Exception: Publications being realigned under different AFPDs,
   or consolidated, may have new series and control numbers.
   11.1.2. If consolidating two or more publications, either use one of the publication numbers
   and supersede both, or request a new control number and supersede both. Note: The
   customer must “own” all of the publications or have written concurrence on the consolidation
   from the owning organization(s). Ensure the statement of concurrence clearly indicates the
   organization that will own the consolidated publication. Also ensure that any
   implementing/supplementary publications are updated (via IC or rewrite) to show the new
   publication number if the series or number of the parent publication changes.
   11.1.3. Numbering Departmental Publications. Once the series has been identified, AFDPO
   will create and assign a unique publication control number. If the publication will become a
   physical (printed) product and has a separate cover, the OPR shall place the series number
   and title on the cover as well as on the first page of the publication.
      11.1.3.1. AF Supplements to DoD Issuances will be identified by both the DoD Issuance
      number and an AF publication number, in that order. AF Supplements to DoDDs will be
      assigned an AFPD number, AF Supplements to DoDIs will be assigned an AFI number,
      AF Supplements to DoD Regulations or Manuals will be assigned an AFMAN number
      (e.g., DoDD3000.7_AFPD10-42, DoDM4525.8_AFMAN 33-306). AFDPO assigns the
      control number; Supplements are posted on the e-Publishing web site under the
      appropriate subject series (e.g., DoDD3000.7_AFPD10-42 would be listed on the e-
      Publishing web site under the 10 series).
      11.1.3.2. AFPMs and GMs not revising an existing policy or guidance publication will
      be numbered using the year the AFPM/is published and be numbered consecutively under
      the appropriate subject series (e.g., AFPM2012-33-01). An AFPM or GM revising an
      existing publication will be numbered using the existing publication’s number followed
      by the appropriate acronym, year, and number (e.g., the first AFPM revising AFPD33-3
      would be numbered AFPD33-3_AFPM2012-01, the second would be numbered
      AFPD33-3_AFPM2012-02, etc.). Publication Managers initiate actions to remove
      expired or superseded AFPMs and GMs from circulation. AFPMs and GMs may be
      reissued for a period up to one year if the policy/guidance has not been incorporated into
      an official publication within the original timeframe allowed. OPRs shall reissue using
      an AF Form 673, obtaining legal review and signatures of the Certifying and Approving
      Officials for the subsequent reissue. The AFPM or GM number will not change when
      reissued, the reissued date will be inserted below the original published date and the
      effective period text within the memo must be changed if appropriate (if less than one-
      year).
      11.1.3.3. Publications implementing a particular AFPD or AF supplement to a DoDD
      fall in the same numbered series and have a three-digit control number (e.g. AFI 65-701
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                              79


     is the first publication that implements AFPD 65-7). Publications that follow/support the
     implementing publication will have consecutive control numbers (e.g. AFI 33-360 will
     further be implemented by AFMAN 33-361).
     11.1.3.4. Air Force supplements to DoD Issuances will bear the DoD number and an Air
     Force publication number (e.g. DoDD5105.83_AFPD90-19; DoDI5000.68_AFI16-122).
     11.1.3.5. TTP numbering is coordinated and jointly assigned with the LeMay Center and
     the issuer.
  11.1.4. Command/Field (MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/Base/Wing). Once the series has been
  identified, the PM/FM assigns the control number. Command/field publications will be
  numbered consecutively under the subject series using at least a 3-digit control number
  (some publications will have a 4-digit control number). (T-1).
     11.1.4.1. Supplements must bear the higher headquarters designator and number, adding
     the field acronym to the end and “SUP” (e.g., AFI33-360_AMCSUP, AFI33-
     360_AMCSUP_89AWSUP, AFI33-360_89AWSUP (if no AMC supplement)). PM/FM
     will approve numbers. Supplements are posted on the e-Publishing web site under the
     appropriate subject series. (T-2).
     11.1.4.2. GMs issuing new guidance that creates a new publication (not Supplement)
     will be numbered consecutively under the appropriate subject series (e.g., ACCGM2013-
     33-01, AFMCGM2013-33-01, etc.). A GM that amends an existing publication will carry
     the amended or supplemented publication’s number followed by the appropriate acronym
     and number (e.g., the first GM that issues guidance amending AFI33-360_ACCSUP
     would be numbered AFI33-360_ACCSUP_ACCGM2013-01, the second to amend
     AFI33- 360_ACCSUP would be numbered AFI33-360_ACCSUP_ACCGM2013-02,
     etc.). The AFPM or GM number will not change when reissued, the reissued date will be
     inserted below the original published date and the effective period text within the memo
     must be changed if appropriate (if less than one-year).
     11.1.4.3. Supplements, and GMs creating new supplements, must bear the higher
     headquarters designator and number, adding the command/field acronym to the end and
     “SUP” (e.g., AFI33-360_AMCSUP, AFI33-360_AMCSUP_89AWSUP, AFI33-
     360_89AWSUP        (if   AMC     does     not    issue a     supplement),    AFI33-
     360_ACCSUP_ACCGM2013-01).
  11.1.5. Interim Changes. The PM/FM assigns a number to each change. ICs are numbered
  cumulatively (IC-1, IC-2, IC-3, IC-4, IC-5). ICs may be spread out over a number of years;
  the assigned number should be cumulative, regardless of the year in which the IC is being
  accomplished. (T-3).
  11.1.6. Classified and CUI publications and forms. Information within classified and CUI
  publications and forms will be marked IAW this publication, AFI 31-401 and Volumes 2 and
  4 of DoDM 5200.01. Publications and forms numbers and titles will be marked as described
  below: (T-0).
     11.1.6.1. The abbreviation of the highest overall security classification or CUI restriction
     within the publication or form shall be added to the end of the publication or form
 80                                                 AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


       number: “-C” for Confidential, “-S” for Secret, and “-TS” for Top Secret; “-O” for
       FOUO. (T-0).
       11.1.6.2. CUI publications and forms may be posted to the unclassified NIPRNET WMS
       web site that limits access to individuals with a valid DoD approved CAC credential and
       in accordance with DoDM 5200.01-V4 regarding access to CUI. (T-0).
       11.1.6.3. For classified (C, S, TS) publications and forms, the unclassified title will have
       “(U)” added to the end of the title to identify that it is unclassified. If the title is
       classified, the words “Classified Title (U)” will be used as the title.
11.2. Posting Unclassified Publications or Forms on the e-Publishing Web site.
   11.2.1. With the exception of ANG wings/subunits, command/field publication managers
   submit appropriate publications/forms for release on the e-Publishing web site to AFDPO-
   PPP. (T-1).
   11.2.2. Submit files for processing via the approved publishing tool (AFIMPT). (T-1). A
   link to the approved publishing tool is located on the e-Publishing web site.
   11.2.3. ANG field publications will be submitted to the local wing PM/FM fully formatted.
   (T-3). AFDPO does not process, post or format ANG field publications.
   11.2.4. After the publication is processed it will be posted to the web site. AFDPO will
   notify the PM/FM via e-mail or fax when publications are posted to the e-Publishing web
   site. AFDPO will provide timely service and strive to post products to the e-Publishing web
   site within 20 business days. If AFDPO requires additional time the publications manager
   will be notified. Note: OPRs are encouraged to notify affected staff offices when a
   publication is released, revised, or rescinded and posted on the e-Publishing web site. The
   OPR notice should include a statement alerting recipients that related publications and/or
   processes may be affected.
   11.2.5. AFPMs and GMs (HAF, command, and field level) will be posted to the e-
   Publishing web site under the appropriate subject series. If an AFPM or a GM (HAF,
   command, or field level) amends an existing publication, AFDPO will post the AFPM or GM
   “on top” of the publication, so that publication users will view the AFPM or GM at the
   beginning of the document.
   11.2.6. Correcting Errors to Posted Publications. AFDPO may correct processing errors and
   other administrative type errors to all posted publications/forms. AFDPO must:
       11.2.6.1. Notify the publication/form OPR of the proposed action. OPR will retain
       notification in official record set.
       11.2.6.2. Annotate the publication with “Corrective Actions applied on (insert date)”
       below the published date.
       11.2.6.3. Insert a summary of corrective actions taken in new section titled “Summary of
       Corrective Actions.” Insert after purpose statement and before any summary of changes.
       11.2.6.4. Units below the wing level that post their own publications to local web sites
       may take corrective actions as described above.
11.3. Posting Classified or Restricted Access Unclassified Publications or Forms.
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                               81


   11.3.1. Classified. Because a classified departmental publishing site is not yet available,
   HAF OPRs and command/field publishing activities may post electronic classified
   publications on the local headquarters SIPRNET sites, if appropriate.
   11.3.2. Controlled Unclassified Information. CUI electronic publications may be made
   available for downloading on AFDPO’s WMS or other approved locally managed web site.
   The WMS web site can restrict access to CAC holders or further restrict by CAC holders
   identified on an OPR provided access list. Contact local security professional to help make
   accessibility/releasability determinations.
   11.3.3. Publications managers and OPRs should review options before submitting final
   package to AFDPO for processing.
   11.3.4. Product Index. Publications posted on SIPRNET sites, other publishing sites, or
   made available only from the OPR, must still be listed under an unclassified title in the
   Product Index on the e-Publishing web site. (T-1).
   11.3.5. AFDPO will not automatically schedule classified or restricted access unclassified
   publications or forms for printing. Printing requests to AFDPO must include justification
   and funding.
11.4. Posting Publications and Forms Issued Below the Wing or ANG Wings/Subunits.
   11.4.1. Publications managers will distribute local publications/forms using approved web
   sites or other approved methods. (T-3).
   11.4.2. Publications and forms managers will maintain a product index of all applicable
   organizational publications and forms. (T-3).
11.5. Special Publication Systems.
   11.5.1. Basis for Setting up a Special Publications System. Special publications exist to
   fulfill unique publishing requirements for a narrowly defined audience. These publications
   must identify in the opening paragraph their linkage with a parent publication listed in an
   AFSC series (e.g. Career Field Education and Training Plans [CFETP], see AFI 36-2201, Air
   Force Training Program, Atch 2). This system will not change or supersede any directive
   publication, form, or report that a directive publication prescribes.
   11.5.2. Establishing a Special Publications System. Obtain approval to create a
   departmental-level system from SAF/AAII Policy Branch. Describe the proposed system,
   including the type of publications you will issue, publication specifications, coordination,
   certification, approval requirements, approximate cost, and proposed distribution. Explain
   why regular publications are not suitable. Reference the directive publication driving the
   need for the special publications system. Any form that the special publications system
   requires must be prescribed in the publication establishing the special system. Once approval
   has been received, work with AFDPO or local PM/FM to establish the publishing process.
11.6. Establishing a Functional Publications Library (FPL).
   11.6.1. Commanders of organizations involved in flight operations are specifically
   authorized to establish and maintain FPLs, containing departmental and command/field-level
   publications. The library will contain a copy of this publication, the Product Index listing of
   included publications, and the product announcements. (T-3).
82                                                AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


  11.6.2. FPLs must link to electronic publications and forms available on the e-Publishing
  web site. Classified/CUI publications and forms may be posted directly to an FPL or printed.
  (T-3).
  11.6.3. Flight operations commanders may establish FPLs by providing written notification
  to the servicing publishing manager. Identify the activity responsible for the library, its
  location, and appoint a primary and alternate library custodian. Officials establishing FPLs
  will ensure custodians are properly trained on publications management. Custodians are
  responsible for ensuring FPL contents are both current and essential. (T-3).
  11.6.4. Availability of FPL Publications. Publications kept in an FPL may be loaned to
  authorized persons for official use, pursuant to DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN33-302. Loaning
  publications is optional and depends on local needs. Do not allow the general public to view,
  copy, or borrow any publication from an FPL (DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN33-302). Since FPLs
  are not open to the public, CUI publications may be filed with other publications.
  11.6.5. Obtaining Publications. Request paper-based publications from the DLA Document
  Services at unit expense. The e-Publishing web site provides a link to the DLA Document
  Services web site for easy access to this bulk printing service.
  11.6.6. Maintaining an FPL. FPL custodians will review product announcements and the
  Product Index on the e-Publishing web site, and regularly review and inventory the contents
  of the FPL, to ensure publications contained in the library are current and essential. (T-3).
  Dispose of custodial records according to guidance in AFI 33-322.
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                               83

                                 FORMS MANAGEMENT

12.1. General Form Guidance. This section establishes Air Force guidance, assigns
responsibilities, and provides specific procedures for the management of Air Force forms. It
applies to all media of forms, whether paper or electronic. It covers the complete lifecycle
management of forms from creation, distribution, use, review, and revision to cancellation. The
use of social security numbers (SSN) within AF forms shall be reduced or eliminated wherever
possible IAW AFI 33-332. (T-0).
   12.1.1. Definition of a Form. Per DoD Instruction 7750.07, DoD Forms Management
   Program, a form is a fixed arrangement of captioned spaces designed for entering and
   extracting prescribed information. Air Force forms are tools used for the collection,
   recording, and/or extraction of information whereby a predetermined set of data fields have
   been established and defined to meet a definitive Air Force purpose or objective. Official Air
   Force form types are listed in Table 12.1 of this publication.
   12.1.2. The terms “IMT” and “Form” are synonymous for forms currently posted on the e-
   Publishing web site. The term “IMT” is being phased out and the designator must be
   removed from forms and publications as soon as possible; it may continue to appear until all
   publications and forms containing that reference are updated.
   12.1.3. Units must adopt and use forms generated at higher-headquarters (that are within
   their chain of command) whenever possible. (T-1).
   12.1.4. Waiver Requests. See Paragraph 1.9
12.2. Types of Forms. The type of form is determined by the scope of its intended use and is
indicated by the form designation (e.g. AF Form 673, AFMC Form 226). If the scope of users
expands or contracts, the form should be redesignated and reprocessed as necessary.

Table 12.1. Types and Descriptions of Forms.

                                 branch, section or office. OPRs
                                 disseminate office forms.
One-time                         Forms that satisfy a one-time       All levels
                                 requirement, are not reused or
                                 reprinted, and are obsolete when
                                 the expiration date is met. The
                                 OPR distributes the forms directly
                                 to activities required to complete
                                 the project. Place “One-time” in
                                 parentheses following the form
                                 number and show the expiration
                                 date next to it (e.g., (One-time,
                                 Expires 31 December 2013)). The
                                 expiration date must not exceed 1
                                 year. OPRs disseminate one-time
                                 forms.
Test                             Test forms are established to be All levels
                                 used for a limited period of time
                                 so they may be evaluated before
                                 becoming permanent. Life of a
                                 test form may not exceed 1 year.
                                 The OPR is responsible for
                                 converting these forms to a
                                 permanent form by no later than
                                 the expiration date. If not
                                 converted to a permanent form,
                                 they automatically become
                                 obsolete on the expiration date.
                                 State “Test” in parentheses
                                 following the form number and
                                 show the expiration date next to it
                                 (e.g., Test, Expires 20 January
                                 2006). OPRs disseminate test
                                 forms.

 Services (MWRS)                    requirements. Give forms
                                    management support to MWRS
                                    activities on a case-by-case basis.
                                    The MWRS activity pays any
                                    printing costs.
 Note: Some actions may require use of non-Air Force forms, such as DoD forms (DD forms), standard
 government forms (SFs), optional forms (OFs), General Services Administration forms (GSA forms),
 General Accounting Office forms (GAO forms), etc. Users will be instructed when use of non-Air Force
 forms is necessary. AFDPO may assist OPRs with other types of forms, but does not monitor forms
 posted on non-Air Force web sites.
12.3. Items Not Managed as Forms (per guidance in DoDI 7750. 07):
   12.3.1. Forms used exclusively for cryptological activities.
   12.3.2. Forms used only once as part of a survey.
   12.3.3. Formatted documents that are largely narrative in nature where the space needed by
   respondents to furnish the desired information varies substantially, such as a comment
   matrix, worksheet, classroom evaluations, or permission slip. Exception: Manage these types
   of documents as prescribed forms if they solicit information covered by the Paperwork
   Reduction Act of 1995, collect information from the public, or require Office of Management
   and Budget (OMB) approval (see AFI 33-324).
   12.3.4. Formatted documents without spaces for entering information, such as instruction
   sheets and bulletins, pamphlets, notices, contract clause sheets, placards, certain tags and
   labels, pattern letters, guide letters, and form letters.
   12.3.5. Tools used for the collection, recording, and/or extraction of information whereby a
   predetermined set of data fields have been established and defined to meet a definitive AF
   purpose or objective that are not prescribed in an official publication or otherwise defined in
   this publication, such as login screens or meeting sign-in sheets.
12.4. Official Form Repository. The e-Publishing web site is the official source for obtaining
prescribed/adopted forms generated by Air Force OPRs, both electronic and physical, with the
exception of ANG wing/subunit prescribed forms and those generated below the wing/base level.
CUI forms may be hosted on the WMS web site. Because a classified departmental publishing
site is not yet available, HAF OPRs and command/field publishing activities may post electronic
classified forms on the local SIPRNET site. All classified forms posted on a headquarters
SIPRNET site must be listed under an unclassified title in the Product Index on the e-Publishing
web site. (T-1).
   12.4.1. “Stocked and Issued” forms are distributed directly by the OPR. The office symbol
   and mailing address of the OPR are listed after the form title in the Product Index; users must
   submit requests directly to the OPR. The OPR is responsible for informing AFDPO when a
   reprint is necessary.
   12.4.2. “Stocked and Used” forms are distributed by the OPR only within the primary
   organization, and used only by that activity. The OPR is responsible for informing AFDPO
   when a reprint is necessary.
 86                                                  AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


   12.4.3. ANG field forms will be submitted to the local wing forms managers, and are not
   sent to AFDPO for processing or posting.
12.5. Prescribing a Form. A new form and the prescribing publication must be published and
distributed simultaneously. This is not the case for revised forms. The prescribing publication:
   12.5.1. Directs organizations and individuals to use the form.
   12.5.2. Cites the form designation, number, and title, (e.g., AF Form 673, Air Force
   Publication/Form Action Request) the first time the form is mentioned. Thereafter, only cite
   the designation and number (i.e., AF Form 673), unless the title would clarify the text.
   12.5.3. States the purpose of the form, how to complete it (if necessary), and how to submit
   it.
   12.5.4. Explains where to submit supply requests if the form is printed.
   12.5.5. Lists prescribed forms by form designation, number, and title in Attachment 1, under
   “Prescribed Forms” after the list of “References”, and on the AF Form 673. Note: The first
   IC or rewrite of a publication must move the forms list from the last paragraph to Attachment
   1. If a Supplement is revised prior to the parent publication relocating the list, it is
   acceptable to have a list of forms in both locations, just do not list the form twice.
   12.5.6. Do not include a copy of the prescribed form(s) within the publication. This will help
   ensure version control, and may eliminate a need to update the publication each time a form
   is revised. If it is necessary to show the form in the publication, identify as a figure and show
   sample entries only.
   12.5.7. The prescribing publication does not need to be revised when a form is revised
   unless instructions related to the revised form need to be updated.
   12.5.8. If a form at any level collects personal information/data it must be prescribed in an
   official publication and managed IAW Privacy Act guidance (see AFI 33-332). (T-0).
12.6. Creating a Form. Forms will primarily be created as electronic forms. Electronic forms
Air Force-wide will be designed using standard software acquired by AFDPO or other software
as approved by SAF/AAII Policy Branch. (T-1). AFDPO will disseminate the standard
development software to all PM/FMs. To ensure forms are developed correctly:
   12.6.1. Identify all necessary data fields and create a sample form. OPRs will need to justify
   the need for the form, the data fields collected, and specify any printing and/or distribution
   requirements during coordination.
       12.6.1.1. All form control numbers are assigned by local PM/FM and the records should
       be filed numerically by the form number. Form numbers are assigned sequentially.
       12.6.1.2. Insert a releasability statement on the bottom of the form only if releasability is
       restricted (either when blank or when filled out). Examples of releasability statements
       include “RELEASABILITY: Access to this form is restricted: this form may be released
       to NATO members only”; “RELEASABILITY: Access to this form is restricted: this
       publication may not be released to foreign nationals”; “RELEASABILITY: Access to
       this form is restricted: this form is classified/FOUO; requests for accessibility must be
       approved by the OPR,” etc. The statement must be prefaced with the phrase
       “RELEASABILITY: Access to this form is restricted.”

       12.6.1.3. Formats, definitions, data types, etc. already exist for many information fields
       commonly used in government forms. OPRs and forms designers should consult the DoD
       Metadata Registry to determine what form fields have been standardized and use
       standardized fields whenever possible. The DoD Metadata Registry is accessible at
       https://metadata.dod.mil/mdrPortal; click on the “Data Element” tab to access
       standardized fields.
       12.6.1.4. Digital signatures will be utilized to the greatest extent possible, unless statute
       (law) requires a wet signature.
   12.6.2. The prototype used during coordination and the final version will be designed in
   conjunction with the local PM/FM.
   12.6.3. Utilize desktop software, such as Microsoft® applications, whenever possible to
   develop office forms. Office forms may also be created using the standard AF form
   development software.
   12.6.4. The publication/form manager will assign the date. Development work on the form
   may be completed while the form is routed for coordination or prior to coordination. Form
   OPRs at the HAF will complete development work during coordination; when form OPRs at
   the HAF submit the prototype to AFDPO for coordination, AFDPO will complete the
   development work at that time. The form date is the effective date; Air Force forms are not
   considered effective until they are released to users IAW this publication. AFDPO will alert
   the local PM/FM and the OPR when a new or revised form is posted on the e-Publishing web
   site. OPRs are encouraged to notify affected staff offices when a form is rescinded or when a
   new or revised form is posted on the e-Publishing web site. The OPR notice should include a
   statement alerting recipients that related publications and/or processes may be affected.
   12.6.5. If the form is approved for electronic generation and has not been automated in the
   desired software, the requester shall seek approval to automate the form using the desired
   software through SAF/AAII Policy Branch.
   12.6.6. If the electronic version differs from the prescribed official image, the form OPR
   and/or SAF/AAII Policy Branch has the right to reject it.
12.7. Adopting a Form. Publications may direct the use of an official form that is prescribed
from another Air Force or other government publication. Adopted forms already exist and are
available from the e-Publishing web site, the MDD, or, if adopting a form created by a different
government agency, the appropriate agency’s web site. You may refer users to the prescribing
publication for instructions on completing and processing the form, adding additional
instructions, if necessary. To determine the prescribing publication of an Air Force form, click
on the “information” icon in the form entry on the e-Publishing web site.
   12.7.1. Cite the form designator and number within the publication, including the title in
   italics at first use; include the full citation in Attachment 1, under “Adopted Forms” after the
   “Prescribed Forms”(”(e.g. AF Form 673, Air Force Publication/Form Action Request).
   Note: The first IC or rewrite of a publication must move the forms list from the last
   paragraph to Attachment 1. If a Supplement is revised prior to the parent publication
   relocating the list, it is acceptable to have a list of forms in both locations (however, do not
   list a form twice).
 88                                                 AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


   12.7.2. An adopted form created by another government agency may be subject to that
   agency’s guidance. Work with the forms manager of the agency responsible for the form to
   ensure that the Air Force guidance/process aligns with that agency’s guidance/process. DoD
   forms created in IBM® software must include the DoD disclaimer.
   12.7.3. Using an adopted form for a purpose not intended by the OPR, or altering the
   appearance of an adopted form, requires written permission from the form’s OPR to alter the
   use of the form.
   12.7.4. Overprint (pre-fill blocks with standard information) an electronic or physical form
   when the number of man-hours saved in filling in the form justifies the extra cost of
   overprinting the fill-in data. Do not alter lines or captions, or add blocks and captions to an
   existing form as this action is a revision of the original form design. This guidance applies to
   both physical and electronic forms. Insert a statement at the bottom of overprinted forms
   indicating the activity responsible for the overprinted material (e.g., “919 MDS Modified
   Overprint.”).
   12.7.5. Functional areas implementing information systems that incorporate existing forms
   must obtain a written waiver to deviate from the OPR of the publication that prescribes the
   form. If approved, the system maintainer must ensure any electronic duplication of the form
   replicates to the highest degree possible the contents (wording), format (layout), and
   sequence (arrangement) of the official form (shall be a “mirror-like image”). Any variation in
   content, format, or sequencing must be approved as a content and/or format waiver to the
   form. The accuracy of the electronic form is the responsibility of the system maintainer
   duplicating the official form. Forms management offices must be involved in electronic
   transaction projects to ensure forms are properly created.
12.8. Records Management. See Chapter 10.
12.9. Form Software Licenses.
   12.9.1. All forms must have a software license before being placed on the e-Publishing web
   site. Note: DD or other agency forms do not have software licenses unless they are designed
   using the standard Air Force software.
   12.9.2. The Form Viewer is openly available to any party with a valid requirement to access
   Air Force forms. It is available for download directly from the e-Publishing web site.
      12.9.2.1. Form designers will require a licensed version of the viewer.
      12.9.2.2. Applications Process Interface licensing will be issued as required.
12.10. Legal and Security Requirements and Considerations.
   12.10.1. Privacy Act of 1974. Forms that collect personal data from individuals for inclusion
   in a Privacy Act (PA) system of records (a collection of records retrieved by an individual’s
   name or personal identifier), and forms that request the individual to enter or verify a social
   security number, must contain a Privacy Act Statement (PAS). (T-0). The PAS allows the
   individual completing the form to make an informed decision about whether to furnish the
   information. The use of social security numbers within AF forms shall be reduced or
   eliminated wherever possible IAW AFI 33-332. Coordinate all proposed new or revised
   forms that collect personal data with the Privacy Act Officer/Manager (PAO/PAM) and/or
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                              89


  servicing legal office on the AF Form 673. The PAO/PAM will assist with developing the
  PAS.
     12.10.1.1. Display PAS on the first page of the form, under the title if possible.
     12.10.1.2. Computer Matching Program. Computer matching is the electronic
     comparison of records from two or more automated systems between Federal agencies,
     state, and local governments for verifying benefits, eligibility, and for debt collection
     purposes. Records involved include those from personnel and payroll systems and
     Federal benefit programs. If the information on the form is subject to computer matching,
     incorporate an appropriate warning into the PAS.
     12.10.1.3. Form managers will not process forms that collect Personal Identifiable
     Information (to include SSN) for publishing without the PAO/PAMs
     coordination/approval. The publishing package must include the PAO/PAM accepted
     SSN justification letter, IAW AFI 33-332.
  12.10.2. United States Postal Service (USPS) Requirements. Forms used as mailers must
  meet USPS requirements. Refer to DoDM4525.8_AFMAN33-306, DoD Official Mail
  Manual, for requirements. (T-0).
  12.10.3. Complying with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. All forms must be
  Section 508 compliant, as established in AFI 33-393. (T-0). AFDPO is responsible for
  ensuring all products posted on the e-Publishing web site are Section 508 compliant. Local
  PM/FM are responsible for ensuring products not posted to the e-Publishing web site are
  Section 508 compliant. See AFI 33-129 for guidance on making forms Section 508
  compliant.
  12.10.4. Guidelines for Classified, Accountable, Storage Safeguarded, and FOUO forms.
  Anyone requesting the creation of these forms must ensure the forms have the required
  markings (see AFI 31-401 and DoDM 5200.01 Volumes 1, 2, & 4, Information Security
  Program). AFDPO will identify these forms in the numerical listing on the e-Publishing web
  site.
     12.10.4.1. Classified Forms. Avoid creating forms that disclose classified information or
     contain classified titles. When a form title is classified, create an unclassified title for
     reference purposes. When designing a classified blank form, show the overall
     classification of the information at the top and bottom of the form design. If the form will
     become classified when filled in, leave sufficient space for the overall classification
     marking by adding the notation "When Filled In" outside the margins at the top and
     bottom of each page of the form. Allow space for entering associated markings,
     classification authority, and downgrading or declassification instructions if deemed
     necessary by the requester.
     12.10.4.2. Accountable Forms. Some blank forms can jeopardize installation/national
     security or could be used to defraud or allow false claims against the Government;
     therefore, you must control, safeguard, and account for these forms. Contact AFDPO for
     further guidance on handling accountable forms (AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil).
     12.10.4.3. Storing Safeguarded Forms. Safeguarded forms are not releasable outside
     DoD because they could be put to unauthorized or fraudulent use (e.g. general officer
 90                                                    AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


       stationary). You need not account for each individual form, but you must store blank
       forms in a secure area. Contact AFDPO for further guidance on storing safeguarded
       forms (AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil).
       12.10.4.4. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Forms. Mark and protect these forms as directed
       in DoDM 5200.01-V4.
   12.10.5. Forms that collect information internal or external to the Air Force must comply
   with the guidance provided in AFI 33-324, regarding the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
12.11. Coordination. New forms, revised forms, and those marked for cancellation require
coordination. (T-3).
   12.11.1. Drafts of new forms should circulate with the prescribing publication for
   coordination. If only the form requires revision or is marked for cancellation, you may
   circulate your form independently of the prescribing publication; see Paragraph A3.2 and
   Table A3.1 for list of coordinating offices.
       12.11.1.1. List all prescribed forms on the AF Form 673, and fill out blocks accordingly.
       If prescribing multiple forms, make use of the “Additional Information” block to indicate
       classification, control status, and printing requirements for each.
       12.11.1.2. OPRs must fill out form-specific information during regular periodic reviews
       or special out-of-cycle reviews.
   12.11.2. The DoD forms manager granted the Air Force an exception/waiver on January 22,
   2013, allowing sole use of the AF Form 673 for all actions on Air Force forms. Use of the
   DD 67 form is only required when action is taken on a non-Air Force form for which the Air
   Force serves as the OPR. Submit an AF Form 673 for new, revised, or obsolete (marked for
   cancellation) forms. The completed AF Form 673 and the form must be submitted to the
   local PM/FM for processing. The HAF publishing manager for departmental forms is
   AFDPO (AFDPO-PPP@pentagon.af.mil).
       12.11.2.1. If requesting an action on a DoD form for which the Air Force serves as the
       OPR submit a completed DD Form 67. DD Form 67 is prescribed by DoD 7750.7-M,
       DoD Forms Management Program Procedures Manual; refer to that publication and
       consult your PM/FM for instructions on completing DD Form 67. (T-0).
       12.11.2.2. The certification and approval authorities for forms are the same as those for
       the prescribing publication.
12.12. Form Revision. An AF Form 673 showing coordination and certification is required to
alter the contents of the form. (T-1). Submit the 673 and the draft form to the forms manager for
processing and posting (AFDPO is the forms manager for HAF OPRs (AFDPO-
PPP@pentagon.af.mil)). The revised form will be re-dated. If applicable, indicate at the bottom
of the form any supersession or disposition instructions, and indicate on the form that superseded
forms are not authorized for use (include the date of the superseded form). Exception: OPRs
may work directly with forms designers to make any purely technical “fixes” to electronic forms
(e.g., alignment of fields, order of tabs, enabling for digital signatures, etc.). Technical fixes must
not alter the layout or the purpose of the form; forms updated in this manner will not be re-dated
and do not require a supersession line. Submit technical fixes to forms designers in writing (via
AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014                                                             91


e-mail or memorandum). Changes to the layout or the purpose of the form do require
coordination.
   12.12.1. The OPR must ensure that guidance related to altered forms in the prescribing
   publication is correct. (T-3). OPRs are encouraged to notify affected staff offices when a
   form is revised and posted to the e-Publishing web site.
   12.12.2. Forms will be reviewed along with the prescribing publication. (T-3). OPRs will be
   asked to provide the form status on an AF Form 673 generated by the publications/forms
   manger.
12.13. Rescinding a Form. A form becomes obsolete when another form supersedes it, when
the OPR rescinds it, or when the prescribing publication is rescinded. If the OPR wishes to
continue use of the form, it must be prescribed in an active publication. (T-3). Obsolete
publications/forms are listed in the Product Index. Links to obsolete forms are removed from the
e-Publishing web site and AFDPO releases a product announcement to notify subscribers of the
cancellation. ANG notifies subscribers of cancellations. OPRs are encouraged to notify affected
staff offices when a form is rescinded. The OPR notice should include a statement alerting
recipients that related publications and/or processes may be affected.
   12.13.1. If you are canceling the prescribing publication the prescribed form will be
   canceled at the same time—it is not necessary to submit more than one AF Form 673; simply
   clarify in the “Additional Information” or “Prescribed Forms” block that the cancellation
   applies to both the publication and the form. If you are rescinding a form or a report but
   maintaining the prescribing publication, the OPR must complete coordination (Attachment
   3)(T-3), obtain certification and approval (T-1), submit a completed AF Form 673 to the
   PM/FM, and send a copy of the request for rescission to the information reports management
   and control office. If the form is classified, reference AFI 31-401 for actions required to
   rescind.
   12.13.2. OPRs are responsible for ensuring that any references made to obsolete forms,
   either prescribed or adopted, are removed from active publications.

                              FORMAL COORDINATION TABLE

A3.1. Publications Formal Coordination. Commanders/Directors, through their PCMs (at
HAF), are responsible for determining the appropriate offices/organizations from which
coordination should be obtained for a draft publication/form, prior to certification and/or
approval. Table A3.1 should be used as a starting point in determining required coordination.
The table is not all-inclusive, but provides recommended coordinating offices for the subject
areas/conditions identified in Column C. Directive publications should be coordinated with all
offices/units having functional interest/technical expertise, oversight responsibilities, and
statutory/regulatory review requirements, even if they do not appear in the table. The offices
listed at Items 1-5 must be given the opportunity to review and provide coordination.
A3.2. Forms Formal Coordination. Ideally, forms should be packaged with the prescribing
publication and coordinated at the same time. List the prescribed forms on the same AF Form
673 as the prescribing publication and provide narrative that identifies the form changes in the
SSS. If the form is being changed out of cycle with the prescribing pub, use Table A3.1 to
determine the appropriate offices for coordination. The SAF/CIO A6 (Command/Field
equivalents – Item 2 in Table A3.1) and any office making approved use of the form in an
information system must be given the opportunity to review and provide coordination.

                                        Attachment 6
       RECOMMENDING IMPROVEMENTS TO AIR FORCE PUBLICATIONS

A6.1. This attachment does not apply to flight manual publications as specified in AFI 11-215.
A6.2. Submit recommended changes and improvements to Air Force publications on AF Form
847. (T-2). Submit emergency reports for conditions that require immediate correction to
prevent fatality, serious injury to personnel, extensive damage to property or a reduction in
operational posture. Submit routine reports for conditions that have negative effects on
operational efficiency, to correct content errors or to recommend improved procedures or
processes. Do not use the AF Form 847 to call attention to word omissions, typographical,
printing or quality errors usually corrected during scheduled reviews unless they cause
misinterpretation. See Table A6.1 for detailed instructions on completing the AF Form 847.
A6.3. Processing AF Forms 847.
   A6.3.1. Submit and process all NAF, base, wing, or unit level initiated AF Forms 847
   through MAJCOM channels. (T-1). FOAs and DRUs will submit AF Forms 847 through
   their parent HAF functional. Submitting organizations, below MAJCOM level, should
   forward recommendations to the MAJCOM functional OPR for the publication. For example,
   if the publication deals with a 36-XXX series instruction, the MAJCOM Functional would be
   MAJCOM/A1. The submitting MAJCOM will forward approve recommendations to the
   appropriate OPR. The final authority for accepting the recommendation is the Air Force
   publications OPR as listed on the front page of the publication. However, the acceptance of
   the recommendation does not officially change the publication. The OPR must initiate and
   complete an IC, GM, or rewrite to change the publication/guidance.
   A6.3.2. The submitting MAJCOM will forward information copies of AF Forms 847 to all
   other MAJCOMs that utilize the AF publication. Using MAJCOMs will forward comments
   on AF Forms 847 suggestions to the OPR for the publication.
   A6.3.3. Authority for disapproving an AF Form 847 rests with the submitting units,
   MAJCOM and the OPR for the publication. All disapproved recommendations will be
   returned down the chain with justification annotated on the AF Form 847 stating the reason
   for the disapproval.
   A6.3.4. The OPR for the publication will notify the submitting MAJCOM as to the final
   disposition of the recommendation.
   A6.3.5. Ensure the originator is informed of the disposition of each AF Form 847 at each
   level of the approval process.

Reverse                            There are four levels (and sections) of review
                                   and coordination. Each level of review is
                                   allocated a Section on the backside of AF Form
                                   847.


Section 1:                         The first level is at the submitting organization,
                                   group/wing (or detachment) leadership. Indicate
                                   whom the form will be forwarded “To” (i.e.
                                   NAF or MAJCOM). Annotate the appropriate
                                   level of concurrence. If you agree with the
                                   intent, but not the wording, then mark
                                   “CONCUR WITH INTENT” and annotate the
                                   recommended wording in the remarks section.
 140            AFI33-360_934AWSUP 20 MARCH 2014


             If “Do Not Concur” is the selected action, the
             form is returned to the originator.
Section 2:   The second level of review is reserved for NAF.
             They comply with the same instruction as
             outlined above. If there is no NAF function then
             the second section is left blank.
Section 3:   The third level of review is reserved for the
             MAJCOM Functional’s use. MAJCOMs will
             assign their control number (i.e., AETC 01-130)
             in block 3 on the front side of the form.
Section 4:   The final level of review is reserved for the
             publication OPR. The OPR will review the
             change request and determine appropriate
             action. The completion of this form does not
