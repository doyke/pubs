                                                 Chapter 1

                                        GENERAL PROVISIONS

1.1. Authority to Accept or Reject Gifts. The authority to accept or reject a gift offered to the Depart-
ment of the Air Force is vested in the Secretary of the Air Force and designees. The authority to accept or
reject a gift offer is dependent upon the value and kind of property being offered. There are several levels
of authority.

1.2. Gifts Requiring Secretarial Acceptance or Rejection. Except as provided in 1.3. through 1.6.
below, any gift of property must be accepted or rejected promptly by, or by direction of, the Secretary of
the Air Force, subject to the policies, procedures, and restrictions of this instruction. The Secretary of the
Air Force delegates authority to accept any gift of personal property to the General Counsel and the Dep-
uty General Counsel of the Air Force. The Secretary of the Air Force delegates authority to accept any gift
of real property to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, Installations and
Environment), the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary (M, RA, I & E), the Deputy Assistant Secretary
(Installations), and the Deputy for Installations Management.

1.3. Gifts of Personal Property that may be Accepted or Rejected Below Secretarial Level. A gift
of tangible or intangible personal property of $50,000 or less, that does not require more than negligible
expenditure for its acceptance and maintenance, may be promptly accepted or rejected by:
   1.3.1. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force.
   1.3.2. The commander of a major command (MAJCOM) who may redelegate this authority to num-
   bered Air Force commanders or their equivalents.
   1.3.3. The commanders of field operating agencies (FOA).
   1.3.4. The Director of the Air Force Museum.
   1.3.5. The Air Force Historian.
   1.3.6. Commanders of US Air Force medical treatment facilities.
   1.3.7. The Director of Department of Defense (DoD) Dependent Schools--Pacific area.
   1.3.8. The Commander, 11th Wing.
   1.3.9. Officials listed above may redelegate their authority to subordinate commanders, but not lower
   than installation commanders. Notwithstanding any such redelegation, commanders of Air Force
   installations may accept or reject gifts of personal property with a value of $5,000 or less.
   1.3.9. (AMC) AMC/CC delegates the authority to accept or reject gifts to the Air Force of tangible or
   intangible personal property valued at $50,000 or less to the numbered Air Force commander, all
   expeditionary mobility task force commanders, and all installation commanders within Air Mobility
   Command.
   1.3.10. Defense accounting officers and disbursing agents may accept monetary gifts consisting of
   travel payments declined by the payee. The gifts must be unconditional and in the amount of $500 or
   less. Detailed processing procedures are contained in DFAS-DE 7010.3-R.

1.4. Gifts of Real Property That May Be Accepted or Rejected Below Secretarial Level. A gift of
real property of $10,000 or less, that does not require expenditures for acceptance or annual maintenance
in excess of $1,000, may be promptly accepted or rejected by:
1.4. (AMC) Gifts of Real Property That May Be Accepted or Rejected Below Secretarial Level.
The validity of the re-delegation of authority contained in AFI 51-601, paragraph 1.4., to accept or reject
specific gifts is questionable due to a conflict with a SAF/IEI memo to AFRPA/DR (SAF/IEI Re-delega-
tions of Authorities Pursuant to Secretary of the Air Force Order SAFO) 700.4, Real Property Acquisi-
tion, dated 13 May 03). In this memo, SAF/IEI re-delegated to AFRPA/DR his authority to accept gifts,
devises and bequests of real property under paragraph 2b of SAFO 700.4, subject to the condition that the
re-delegation does not authorize the acceptance of any such gift, devise or bequest of real property that is
valued at more than $10,000.00 or that requires expenditures for acceptance and annual maintenance in
excess of $1,000.00. The SAF/IEI letter specifically indicates that this authority may not be further
re-delegated. Until this apparent conflict is resolved through a properly promulgated order or instruction,
AMC units will process these types of gifts IAW the above referenced SAF/IEI memo.
    1.4.1. The Civil Engineer, HQ USAF.
    1.4.2. The commander of a MAJCOM or Direct Reporting Unit (DRU).
    1.4.3. The Chief of the Air Force Reserve.
    1.4.4. The Director of the Air National Guard.
    1.4.5. The Commander, 11th Wing.
    1.4.6. Deputy and Assistant Deputy Chiefs of Staff for engineering and services, or comparable offi-
    cials, or the officials listed above.
    1.4.7. The officials listed above may redelegate their authority to subordinate commanders, but not
    lower than Air Force installation commanders.

1.5. Gifts of Real Property for the Air Force Museum. The Director of the Air Force Museum is
authorized to promptly reject or accept gifts of $25,000 or less for installation as real property in the
USAF Museum Memorial Park, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

1.6. Gifts for the United States Air Force Academy . Except for gifts used to fund endowments, aca-
demic chairs, or to support visiting professors or other similar individuals providing instruction to cadets,
the Superintendent of the Air Force Academy is authorized to reject or accept a gift of tangible or intangi-
ble personal property of $100,000 or less and a gift of real property of $10,000 or less. The Superintendent
may redelegate this authority to principal subordinates.
    1.6.1. Gifts used to fund endowments, academic chairs, or to support visiting professors or other sim-
    ilar individuals providing instruction to cadets must be approved by the Secretary of the Air Force or
    his/her designee.

1.7. Determination of the Nature of an Offer of a Gift:
    1.7.1. Officials receiving a gift offer must initially determine whether a gift has been offered condi-
    tionally or unconditionally, because procedures for the acceptance of conditional or unconditional
    gifts and property accounting are similar but not identical. See Chapter 2, Chapter 3, and Chapter 4.
AFI51-601_AMCSUP1_I 28 JANUARY 2004                                                                          7


   1.7.2. If there is any doubt as to whether the offer is conditional or unconditional, process as a condi-
   tional gift. See Chapter 3.

1.8. Expenses Prior to Acceptance. Officials receiving a gift offer must inform the prospective donor
that the Air Force cannot assume responsibility for any expenses incurred before the offered gift is
accepted, even if it is in the temporary custody of the Air Force.

1.9. Custodial Responsibility. Except in unusual circumstances, the Air Force must not accept custody
of a gift before it is officially accepted. When money or negotiable instruments are offered, advise the pro-
spective donor to retain custody until official acceptance of the gift. If the Air Force assumes custody,
advise the donor in writing that acceptance of money or endorsement of negotiable instruments does not
constitute official acceptance of the gift. If an authorized officer later determines that the gift cannot be
accepted, refund the money or value of the negotiable instruments upon endorsement to the prospective
donor. The Air Force will not pay interest on money or the value of negotiable instruments returned to a
prospective donor according to this instruction. If the Air Force assumes custody of gifts other than
money or negotiable instruments, inform the donor in writing that the Air Force cannot assume responsi-
bility for any loss or damage to the gift before it is officially accepted. Immediately turn over money or
negotiable instruments accepted for custodial purposes to the local defense accounting officer (DAO) for
deposit to Suspense Account 57F3875 pending a determination as to official acceptance.
   1.9.1. If an authorized official accepts the gift, notify the local DAO. The DAO processes an SF 1081,

     ered to a subordinate command for custody, pending acceptance.

2.6. Rejection of Gifts. The person authorized to accept an unconditional gift should not reject any gift,
unless its acceptance would not be in the best interest of the Air Force.
     2.6.1. Gifts may be rejected under the following circumstances:

        by Congress.
        2.6.1.2. The offered item is extremely dangerous.
        2.6.1.3. The offered item is in bad taste.
        2.6.1.4. Acceptance of the gift would raise a serious question of impropriety in light of the donor's
        present or prospective business relationships with the Department of the Air Force.

     delivered to, and is accepted by, the Corps of Engineers, acting in behalf of the Secretary of the Air
     Force. Before accepting a deed, the Corps must assure the deed conveys good title. If a donor offers a

     work to SAF/AART. If the item is accepted for inclusion in the USAF Art Collection (see AFI
     81-104), SAF/AART assumes responsibility for the artwork and controls its future use. If the
     donated artwork is not accepted in the USAF Art Collection, but is nonetheless accepted as a gift
     by an authorized official, the local unit assumes control of the artwork. No one may make repro-
     ductions of artwork in the USAF Art Collection without the permission of SAF/AART. No one
     may make reproductions of other artwork accepted as gifts without the permission of the com-
     mander controlling the artwork. The purely commercial use of any artwork accepted by the Air
     Force is prohibited.

ment 3. Tailoring of the offer is acceptable as warranted by the circumstances in each case.

secretarial level will submit a copy of the letter accepting the gift to the appropriate functional activities.
See paragraph 3.11.

ment 5 as a guide. Modify the acceptance when the circumstances warrant it. Tailoring is appropriate if
the offer contains special conditions or arrangements that should be acknowledged.

approval, the Air Staff office concerned will prepare the letter of acceptance and submit it, with the
approval of the Office of the Chief of Staff, to the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, or his /her des-
ignee, for signature.

concerned will submit a proposed letter of rejection (e.g. attachment Attachment 4 or Attachment 5)
with approval of the Office of The Chief of Staff, to the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, or desig-
nee, for signature.

3.17. Accounting for Gift Property Accepted Under 10 U.S.C. 2601. Keep all records of property
received by the Air Force under 10 U.S.C. 2601 separate from property acquired otherwise. Account for
conditional gift property accepted under 10 U.S.C. 2601 as follows:
     3.17.1. Real Property. Use records prescribed by AFI 32-9005, Real Property Accounting and
     Reporting.
     3.17.2. Historical Property. Use records prescribed by AFI 84-101, Historical Products, Services
     and Requirements.
     3.17.3. Tangible Personal Property. Account for tangible personal property using records and pro-
     cedures prescribed by AFI 23-111, Management of Government Property in Possession of the Air
     Force and AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual.
     3.17.4. Money and Other Intangible Personal Property. Deposit funds received as gifts or pro-
     ceeds from the sale or investment of these gifts to Account 578928. Do not deposit gifts in this
     account until the offer has been accepted (see paragraph 1.4.).
        3.17.4.1. Officials authorized to accept gifts will direct the appropriate agency to deposit gift
        funds to the Trust Fund Receipt Account 578928 and forward a copy of DD Form 1131, Cash Col-
        lection Voucher, or SF 1081 to DFAS-DE/ADRA with a request for issuance of Allocation/
        Authority documents. DFAS-DE/ADRA will issue a Budget Authorization/Allocation document
        to the MAJCOM under appropriation 57X8928. Funds cannot be spent until Budget Authoriza-
        tion/Allocation documents have been received and recorded.
        3.17.4.2. When a gift (other than those accepted below the Secretarial level) has been accepted,
        SAF/FMPB will advise recipient commander to accept and deposit check to Trust Fund Receipt
        Account 578928, or process an SF 1081 if previously deposited to Account 57F3875, and forward
        a copy of DD Form 1131 or SF 1081 to DFAS-DE/ADRA with a request for Budget and Alloca-
        tion Authority documents.
        3.17.4.3. DFAS-DE/ADRA is responsible for investment in government securities as required by
        limitations set forth in the conditions of the gift. Funds used for investment are not allocated.
AFI51-601_AMCSUP1_I 28 JANUARY 2004                                                                           17


        DFAS-DE/ADRA will allocate proceeds from the investment (discount or interest earned) to the
        recipient command when realized.
        3.17.4.4. When a gift amount is not fully spent, dispose of the unused balance as follows:
        3.17.4.5. If the nature of the conditions of the gift is such that the unused funds cannot be used for
        another purpose or by another activity, advise the donor of the amount of unused funds and ask
        him or her to provide disposition instructions. Either refund the unused gift balance to the donor or
        consider it a new gift, depending on the donor's instructions. If the donor does not desire a refund,
        do not process the balance as a new offer of a gift, provided the donor's disposition instructions
        authorize use of the funds for a purpose or by an activity other than that indicated in the original
        offer of gift.
        3.17.4.6. If the condition of the gift allows use of the residual funds by activities other than those
        originally funded, the unused balance should be identified, through channels, to SAF/FMPB as
        available for withdrawal and subsequent reallocation to another activity. For example, the Secre-
        tary (or other authorized official) may withdraw the unused balance and reallocate it to the US Air
        Force Academy, if such is within the scope of the conditions of the original gift.
    3.17.5. Artistic Property. SAF/AART will keep records for artwork accepted into the USAF Art
    Collection. Local units will keep records for other artwork.
    3.17.6. Property records must positively identify the property as gift property.
    3.17.7. Prominently and clearly stamp the records described in 3.17.1., 3.77.2, 3.17.3. and 3.17.5.:
    "PROPERTY ACQUIRED UNDER PROVISIONS OF 10 U.S.C. 2601."
    3.17.8. Prominently and clearly stamp the records described in 3.17.4.: "FUNDS ACQUIRED
    UNDER PROVISIONS OF 10 U.S.C. 2601."

3.18. Transfer of Title. With respect to conditional gifts of real property under 10 U.S.C. 2601, the offer
of a gift is merely an offer to transfer title to the property to the Secretary of the Air Force acting on behalf
of the United States of America. With respect to all other conditional gifts under 10 U.S.C. 2601, accep-
tance of the offer of a gift effects a transfer of title to the gift property to the Secretary of the Air Force
acting on behalf of the United States.

3.19. Sale of Gift Property. Only the Secretary of the Air Force may, except when specifically prohib-
ited by the terms of the offer, sell any gift or property received under 10 U.S.C. 2601. Treat the proceeds
of sale in the same manner as a gift of money. Deposit the proceeds in the appropriate account. They are
subject to disbursement at the discretion of the Secretary of the Air Force, according to the terms and con-
ditions of the gift. AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property governs the disposal of all real property.

3.20. Superintendent of the Air Force Academy. The Superintendent of the Air Force Academy may,
except when specifically prohibited by the terms of the offer, sell any books and library materials deemed
excess to the needs of the Academy library.

                                                 Chapter 4

               CONDITIONAL GIFTS NOT ACCEPTABLE UNDER 10 U.S.C. 2601

4.1. General Provisions. The Secretary of Defense is authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2608 to accept or reject,
on behalf of the United States, any gift made on condition that it be used by the Department of Defense.
     4.1.1. Limitations.
        4.1.1.1. The statute does not modify or repeal the authority to accept conditional gifts granted
        under any other provisions of law.
        4.1.1.2. This statute does not impair the authority of the Secretary of the Air Force under 10
        U.S.C. 2601 to accept or reject a conditional gift.

4.2. Procedures for Accepting Gifts Other Than Under 10 U.S.C. 2601. When an Air Force com-
mand receives a conditional gift (offer of a gift) and determines that the gift cannot be accepted under 10
U.S.C. 2601 and under Chapter 3, take the following steps:
     4.2.1. Money or Other Intangible Personal Property. The receiving command:
        4.2.1.1. Acknowledges receipt of the gift and its referral to the Department of Defense, but will
        not indicate acceptance or rejection of the gift on behalf of the United States.
        4.2.1.2. Sends the money or other intangible personal property, together with the acknowledg-
        ment and original correspondence, to DFAS-DE/ALA, Denver CO 80279.
        4.2.1.3. Recommends, in the letter of transmittal to DFAS-DE/ALA, acceptance or rejection of
        the gift and cites the appropriation or fund account to which the proceeds of the gift should be
        credited to carry out the donor's intent.
     4.2.2. Real Property or Tangible Personal Property. The command receiving a conditional offer
     of a gift of real property or tangible personal property:
        4.2.2.1. Acknowledges receipt of the offer and advises the donor of its referral to the Department
        of Defense, but will not indicate acceptance or rejection of the gift on behalf of the United States.
        4.2.2.2. Notifies SAF/FMPB and recommends acceptance or rejection of the gift. SAF/FMPB
        will, in turn, notify the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Comptroller).
        4.2.2.3. Sends a copy of the acknowledgment with notification and recommendation to SAF/
        FMPB.

4.3. Doubtful Cases. In case of doubt as to whether a conditional gift may properly be accepted under
10 U.S.C. 2601 or whether it must be processed under 10 U.S.C. 2608, resolve it in favor of 10 U.S.C.
2601 and process the offer of gift under Chapter 3 of this instruction. HQ USAF will make the final
determination, and will direct that the gift be transmitted to DFAS or the Assistant Secretary of Defense
(Comptroller), if appropriate.
AFI51-601_AMCSUP1_I 28 JANUARY 2004                                                                         19


4.4. Advise of Disposition. The Director, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (in the case of a con-
ditional gift of money or intangible personal property) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Comptrol-
ler) (in the case of a conditional gift of real or tangible personal property) are responsible for the official
acceptance or rejection of the gift and for notifying the donor and the agency concerned of the action
taken.

                                                  Chapter 5

                           GIFTS FOR DISTRIBUTION TO INDIVIDUALS

5.1. Scope. This chapter establishes procedures for the acceptance or rejection of gifts offered to the Air
Force for distribution to Air Force personnel. It does not apply to gifts offered to Air Force personnel from
sources outside the Department of Defense, (see 5 C.F.R. 2635 Subpart B [JER section 2-100]), to gifts
among Air Force personnel, (see 5 C.F.R. 2635 Subpart C [JER section 2-100]), gifts given to nonappro-
priated funds (see AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds, Chapter 5 ), or to gifts offered to Air Force
personnel from foreign governments, (see AFI 51-901, Gifts from Foreign Governments). This chapter
refers to gifts of personal items offered to the Air Force for the benefit of, and distribution to, Air Force
members and employees.

5.2. Acceptable Gifts. The Air Force may accept under this chapter only those gifts of a desirable and
useful nature, that contribute to the health, comfort, convenience, or morale of military personnel. (For
example: playing cards, books, or written material for hospitalized members.) Tobacco products and alco-
holic beverages are not considered acceptable gifts.

5.3. Responsibilities Assigned.
     5.3.1. Gifts offered to the Air Force for distribution to Air Force members and employees must be
     accepted or rejected by the Secretary of the Air Force, or designee, in compliance with the provisions
     of paragraphs 1.1. through 1.6. of this instruction. The total value of the gift will be used to determine
     the authority for accepting or rejecting gifts processed under this Chapter. (For example, if the total
     value of a gift is less than $50,000, the commander of a major command (or his delegee), the com-
     mander of a field operating agency, or the commander of an Air Force medical treatment facility may
     accept or reject the gift, regardless of the cost of items to be distributed to individual personnel or
     employees.) Note: Before accepting proposed gifts that would be distri-buted under the procedures of
     paragraph 5.3.4., below, coordinate with the Commander, Air Force Services Agency, in order to
     determine whether acceptance would be in the best interest of the Air Force.
     5.3.1. (AMC) AMC/CC delegates the authority to accept or reject gifts offered to the Air Force for
     distribution to Air Force members and employees, when the total value is $50,000 or less, to the num-
     bered Air Force commander, all expeditionary mobility task force commanders, and all installation
     commanders within Air Mobility Command.
     5.3.2. After acceptance, CONUS commanders may receive gifts intended for distribution to person-
     nel solely within their command, and determine the method of distribution. Commanders may dele-
     gate this authority to subordinate commanders.
     5.3.2. (AMC) AMC/CC delegates to the numbered Air Force commander, all expeditionary mobility
     task force commanders, and all installation commanders within Air Mobility Command the authority
     to receive, and to determine the method of distribution of, gifts that have been accepted for distribu-
     tion to personnel solely within their respective commands.
     5.3.3. After acceptance, overseas commanders may receive gifts from donors located within their
     geographic area and intended for distribution to personnel solely within their command. The overseas
     major commander may also determine the method of distribution. Commanders may delegate this
     authority to subordinate commanders.
AFI51-601_AMCSUP1_I 28 JANUARY 2004                                                                21


  5.3.3. (AMC) AMC/CC delegates to all overseas installation commanders within Air Mobility Com-
  mand the authority to receive, and to determine the method of distribution of, gifts from donors
  located within their geographic area, which are intended for distribution to personnel solely within
  their respective commands.
  5.3.4. After acceptance, the Commander, Air Force Services Agency is designated to receive gifts
  from persons or organizations in the United States for distribution to overseas commands, and for
  CONUS distribution when gifts are intended for military personnel or employees of more than one
  MAJCOM. The Commander, Air Force Services Agency is also responsible for determining the
  method of distribution.

5.4. Advertising and Publicity.
     5.4.1. By the Donor of the Gift. Do not place restrictions on advertising or publicity by the donor.
     However, such advertising or publicity should not imply an endorsement of the product by the Air
     Force or any Air Force member or employee.
        5.4.1.1. A donor may place on the gift a marking which identifies the property as being donated
        by a particular person, group, or organization. However, the marking must be in good taste and
        must not be worded so that it endorses (or implies an endorsement of) the product by the Air Force
        or any Air Force member or employee.
        5.4.1.2. Receipt by an Air Force commander of a gift so marked will not be construed as either
        advertising or publicity of the gift by the Air Force.
     5.4.2. By the Commander Receiving the Gift for Distribution:
        5.4.2.1. Do not publicly acknowledge the receipt of the gift, except in special cases specifically
        authorized by the Secretary of the Air Force. The commander authorized to receive the gift will
        acknowledge its receipt by an appropriate letter to the donor on behalf of the military personnel of
        the command concerned.
        5.4.2.2. Do not grant special concessions or privileges to the donor.
        5.4.2.3. Do not initiate publicity for the donor.

5.5. Transportation Charges:
     5.5.1. Packaging and Transportation Charges Paid by the Donor. Except for the gifts discussed
     in 5.5.2., accept gifts under this chapter only if the donor pays all packaging and transportation
     charges to the following points:
        5.5.1.1. Gifts for Distribution in the CONUS. The distribution point or points designated by the
        receiving commander or Commander, Air Force Services Agency.
        5.5.1.2. Gifts for Distribution in Overseas Commands. The port of embarkation or other
        coastal activity designated by the Commander, Air Force Services Agency, or to the point desig-
        nated by the receiving overseas commander. Overseas commanders must make all necessary
        arrangements with the port of embarkation for shipment of gift property to its destination in the
        overseas area.
     5.5.2. Transportation Charges Paid by the Air Force. The Air Force may pay transportation
     charges from current appropriations for gifts in this chapter, under the following conditions:
        5.5.2.1. The gift consists of supplies or materials that would otherwise be purchased with appro-
        priated funds and transported to their destination at Government expense.
        5.5.2.2. No conditions of any kind are attached to the gift.

5.6. Temporary Custody of Gift Items. If an offer of gift under this chapter is made to someone who is
not authorized to accept it, and the donor specifically requests that the Air Force assume custody of the
gift while the offer is processed, inform the donor that the Air Force cannot assume responsibility for any
AFI51-601_AMCSUP1_I 28 JANUARY 2004                                                                   23


loss or damage to the property before it is officially accepted and delivered to a point designated under
paragraph 5.5.1.1. or paragraph 5.5.1.2.

similar documents with a present or future value.

gifts involving construction on Air Force land or any modification, alteration, or addition to Air Force
structures which will result in additions to the Air Force real property inventory will be considered and
processed under this instruction and AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property, as gifts of real property.

communications and others) in the chain of command that process and route an offer of gift to the Air
Force official that has authority to accept or reject it.

         IC 99-1 TO AFI 51-601, GIFTS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE


15 NOVEMBER 1999


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This interim change (IC) 99-1 clarifies that the acceptance level for conditional gifts is that specified in
paragraphs 1.3. through 1.6. and adds an item of pertinent information to be transmitted with an offer of
conditional gift when forwarding to a higher level for acceptance. See the last attachment of the publica-
tion for the complete IC. A bar (|) preceding a paragraph indicates changes from the previous edition.


3.3. Who May Accept. The Secretary of the Air Force or designee may accept conditional gifts at the Sec-
retarial level. Authorized persons below the Secretarial level, as provided in paragraphs 1.3. through 1.6.,
are also authorized to accept conditional gifts. When in doubt that the value of the gift, or the cost of
accepting and maintaining it, is within limits permitting acceptance below the Secretarial level, the person
receiving the gift offer will process the offer to the Secretarial level. The person who accepts a gift below
secretarial level will submit a copy of the letter accepting the gift to the appropriate functional activities.
See paragraph 3.11.
3.10.6. Summarize the item’s significance to the Air Force. Include the recommendation of the installa-
tion commander (or equivalent) transmitting the offer (and any intermediate commander’s coordination)
for acceptance or rejection.

        IC 2003-L TO AFI 51-601, GIFTS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE


26 NOVEMBER 2003
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This interim change (IC) 2003-l changes the OPR responsible for receiving and distributing gifts to: 1)
persons in overseas commands, and 2) military personnel or employees of more than one MAJCOM.
5.3.1. Gifts offered to the Air Force for distribution to Air Force members and employees must be
accepted or rejected by the Secretary of the Air Force, or designee, in compliance with the provisions of
paragraphs 1.1. through 1.6. of this instruction. The total value of the gift will be used to determine the
authority for accepting or rejecting gifts processed under this Chapter. (For example, if the total value of
a gift is less than $50,000, the commander of a major command (or his delegee), the commander of a field
operating agency, or the commander of an Air Force medical treatment facility may accept or reject the
gift, regardless of the cost of items to be distributed to individual personnel or employees.) Note: Before
accepting proposed gifts that would be distri-buted under the procedures of paragraph 5.3.4., below, coor-
dinate with the Commander, Air Force Services Agency, in order to determine whether acceptance would
be in the best interest of the Air Force.
5.3.4. After acceptance, the Commander, Air Force Services Agency is designated to receive gifts from
persons or organizations in the United States for distribution to overseas commands, and for CONUS dis-
tribution when gifts are intended for military personnel or employees of more than one MAJCOM. The
Commander, Air Force Services Agency is also responsible for determining the method of distribution.
5.5.1.1. Gifts for Distribution in the CONUS. The distribution point or points designated by the receiv-
ing commander or Commander, Air Force Services Agency.
5.5.1.2. Gifts for Distribution in Overseas Commands. The port of embarkation or other coastal activ-
ity designated by the Commander, Air Force Services Agency, or to the point designated by the receiving
overseas commander. Overseas commanders must make all necessary arrangements with the port of
embarkation for shipment of gift property to its destination in the overseas area.
