SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The summary
of changes include requiring those members who score 90 or above on their Fitness Assessment
(FA) and test in all four components to only test once a year; made Airmen responsible for
maintaining currency; added component exemptions; deleted fitness patches; standardized
number of failures for discharge recommendation, established a Fitness Assessment Cell (FAC)
to centralize and standardize the administration of FAs; set biannual testing requirements for
RegAF, NGB (Title 10/Statutory Tour), and AFR members; revised component weighting and
scoring based on health-fitness hierarchy; established requirements to score a composite 75 and
meet the minimum component value for each component to earn a passing fitness assessment
score; made any score below the minimum component value for each component read zero;
provided targets in each component; set an Altitude Time Correction for the aerobic component
(1.5 mile run and 2.0 kilometer walk) for installations at 5,250 feet above sea level and greater;
amended the walk-test; added a body mass index (BMI) screen and body fat assessment (BFA)
for those Airmen who fail the abdominal circumference measurement but pass all three other
components with a score of 75 points out of the remaining 80 points; and Air Force Fitness
Program appeal requests will now be initially reviewed and approved or denied by the Wing
Commander or equivalent.

                                 COMMANDER’S INTENT

1.1. It is every Airman’s responsibility to maintain the standards set forth in this AFI 365
days a year. Being physically fit allows you to properly support the Air Force mission. The
goal of the Fitness Program (FP) is to motivate all members to participate in a year-round
physical conditioning program that emphasizes total fitness, to include proper aerobic
conditioning, muscular fitness training, and healthy eating. An active lifestyle will increase
productivity, optimize health, and decrease absenteeism while maintaining a higher level of
readiness. Commanders and supervisors must incorporate fitness into the Air Force culture
establishing an environment for members to maintain physical fitness and health to meet
expeditionary mission requirements. The Fitness Assessment (FA) provides commanders with a
tool to assist in the determination of overall fitness of their military personnel. Commander-
driven physical fitness training is the backbone of the Air Force Fitness Program and an integral
part of mission requirements. The program promotes aerobic and muscular fitness, flexibility,
and optimal body composition of each member in the unit.

                                           Chapter 3

                                  FITNESS ASSESSMENT

3.1. General. The AF uses an overall composite fitness score and minimum scores per
component based on aerobic fitness, body composition, and muscular fitness components to
determine overall fitness. Members must earn a composite score of 75 or greater, and meet the
component minimums identified in Attachment 10 (and Attachment 12 if taking the 2.0-
kilometer walk test).
   3.1.1. Scoring. Minimum component points do not constitute the minimum required to earn
   a composite passing score and points below the required minimum component values read
   zero. Scoring the minimum component points in all FA components will not generate
   enough points to earn a composite score of 75 or greater. The minimum components are
   established to ensure that members test adequately in all components rather than excelling in
   some and disregarding others.
       3.1.2. Target values are designed to illustrate a combination of component points which
       would equal an overall 75 composite score. Airmen failing to meet a target component
       value, but still scoring at or above the minimum component point value (lowest
       “fitness/health risk” limit), can still pass the assessment by exceeding targets in other
       components.
   3.1.3. Overall fitness is directly related to health risk, including risk of disease and death.
   Health and readiness benefits increase as aerobic fitness, body composition, and muscular
   fitness improve with increases in physical activity.
   3.1.4. A FA will be deemed official or unofficial prior to the administration of the first
   component. A FA started as official cannot be changed to unofficial during administration.
   Likewise, a FA started as unofficial cannot be changed to official.
3.2. Fitness Assessment Components.
   3.2.1. Body composition component.
       3.2.1.1. Evaluated by abdominal circumference (AC) measurements.
   3.2.2. Aerobic component.
       3.2.2.1. Evaluated by the 1.5-mile timed run.
       3.2.2.2. Alternative Aerobic Test: Members not medically cleared to complete the 1.5-
       mile run will be assessed by the 2.0-kilometer walk as determined by the PCM or ANG
       MLO unless otherwise exempted.
   3.2.3. Muscular fitness component.
       3.2.3.1. Evaluated by number of push-ups and sit-ups completed within 1 minute.
3.3. Fitness Assessment Requirements. FAC augmentees will conduct the FA for all Airmen
(RegAF, AFR, and ANG), (except basic military and technical training students, tested by
training cadre PTLs/MTLs IAW paragraph 7.1.3) and will support FAs for ARC tenant units at
active duty installations to include UTA weekends. Installations will develop a local plan,
signed by the Installation Commander, for Unit Commanders to appoint PTLs and UFPMs to
 24        AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013


augment the FAC for the purpose of administering FAs. FAC augmentees will conduct FAs and
the designated FAC Manager will provide oversight. FAC augmentees will not test members
from their own unit/PAS code. FA scores will only be updated by Fitness and Sports Center
personnel, or designated UFPMs/FAC augmentees per local guidance. NOTE: UFPMs/FAC
augmentees will not update FA scores in AFFMS for personnel from their own unit/PAS code.
Fitness Center staff should not be used to augment the FAC to conduct FAs.
   3.3.1. FA procedures training will cover official testing procedures, using the AF/A1
   approved standardized slides, and will not be deviated from under any circumstances.
   UFPMs and PTLs augmenting the FAC must possess PTL-B certification and complete
   refresher FA procedure training prior to administering any FAs as a FAC augmentee.
   3.3.2. All members must complete the FSQ (Attachment 4) and provide it to their UFPM
   (Wing FPM for ANG) for review prior to FA. If the member arrives at the FAC without a
   FSQ, the FAC will ensure the member completes a FSQ for review before the FA is
   administered. NOTE: Failure to complete FSQ does not invalidate the FA. FAC will
   document any cases where FSQ is not complete and attach to FA.
      3.3.2.1. The FSQ will be completed no earlier than 30 calendar days (90 days for ARC),
      but NLT 7 days prior to FA to provide time for medical evaluation, when indicated.
      3.3.2.2. A medical provider must evaluate all members with health issues identified on
      the FSQ prior to the FA. If any item on the FSQ indicates a condition which might limit
      performance of any component of the FA, and there is not an accompanying current AF
      Form 469, the UFPM will refer the member for medical evaluation. The member will
      carry the FSQ to the medical evaluation. The provider or ARC MLO will complete and
      sign the appropriate place on the FSQ, and complete an AF Form 469 if applicable, and
      the member will return the FSQ to the UFPM and/or FAC.
3.4. Assessment Procedures.
   3.4.1. All components of the FA must be completed within a 3-hour window on the same
   day. If FAC staff/augmentees determine extenuating circumstances prevent completion of
   the test (e.g., rapidly changing or severe weather conditions, emergencies, injury during FA,
   or travel time needed to complete other components at alternate locations, etc…) then all
   components must be rescheduled and completed at the earliest opportunity, but within 5 duty
   days. ARC members must be in military duty status for assessments. ARC Airmen will be
   required to retest the next date they are in appropriate military duty status and official FAs
   are being conducted.
   3.4.2. Airmen only have one opportunity to complete each of the FA components per FA. If
   an Airman refuses to complete their FA due to failing to meet the minimum in one or
   multiple components, their incomplete FA will still count and be updated in AFFMS. Scores
   for all components are final when entered into AFFMS.
      3.4.2.1. Illness or injury during the FA. If an Airman becomes injured or ill during the
      FA, he/she will have the option of being evaluated at the Medical Treatment Facility
      (MTF) whether they complete the FA or not. Before departing the test location, Airmen
      must notify the FAC of the presence of illness/injury by checking the illness/injury block
      on the AF Form 4446.
AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013                        25


NOTE: ARC Airmen must promptly report any medical condition (i.e. disease, injury, operative
procedure or hospitalization, etc) that might impact their utilization and readiness to his or her
commander, supervisor, or supporting military medical facility personnel. Each commander and
supervisor must notify the servicing medical facility when he/she becomes aware of any changes
in an ARC member’s medical status including any medical condition that occurred during the FA
and/or prevented the member from completing the FA. Any concealment or claim of disability
proven to be made with the intent to defraud the government may result in appropriate punitive
action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or appropriate administrative action.
           3.4.2.1.1. If an Airman checks the illness/injury block of the AF Form 4446, the FAC
           staff (or UFPM where no FAC exists) will sign the form acknowledging that they will
           hold scores to allow for medical evaluation and Commander review. Additionally,
           the FAC staff will transmit a copy of the AF Form 4446 to the UFPM for the Unit
           Commander’s review within two duty days. For RegAF and AGR Airmen, the FAC
           (or UFPM where no FAC exists) will enter the FA results in AFFMS on the 6th duty
           day if the Commander does not invalidate test results or no response from the
           Commander is received within this timeframe. For non-AGR and Traditional ARC
           Airmen, the FAC (or UFPM where no FAC exists) will enter scores into AFFMS at
           the conclusion of the next UTA if the Commander does not invalidate the test results
           or no response from the Commander is received within this timeframe.
           3.4.2.1.2. If the medical evaluation validates the illness/injury (Attachment 15), the
           Unit Commander may invalidate the FA results by checking the “I render this test
           invalid” block of the AF Form 4446, signing, and returning the form to the FAC. If
           the FA is invalidated, the Airman will be required to retest on all non-exempt FA
           components within five duty days from original FA test date. If an AF Form 469 is
           required, an additional five duty days from medical evaluation date will be allowed
           for the AF Form 469 to be generated and provided. Non-AGR and Traditional ARC
           Airmen will be required to retest the next date they are in appropriate military duty
           status and official FAs are being conducted. NOTE: Original FA will count unless
           rendered invalid by the Unit Commander.
           3.4.2.1.3. Airmen will notify their Commander within one duty day of the FA
           regarding the injury/illness to ensure communication regarding test validity with the
           MTF and FAC staff occurs prior to score entry into AFFMS.
   3.4.3. Body composition (height, weight, and AC) must be the first component assessed in
   the FA.
   3.4.4. The muscular fitness components (push-ups and sit-ups) may be accomplished before
   or after the 1.5-mile run or 2.0-kilometer walk according to the installation FACs established
   procedures.
   3.4.5. There is a minimum 3-minute rest period between components.
3.5. Body Composition Assessment.
   3.5.1. Height and Weight.
       3.5.1.1. Obtain height and weight IAW DoDI 1308.3. These measurements are not
       factored into the member’s composite score
 26           AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013


   3.5.2. Abdominal Circumference (AC).
         3.5.2.1. The AC measurement is used to obtain the body composition component score.
         The use of AC measurement has been authorized by DoD to meet the body composition
         requirement. See Attachment 7.
3.6. Body Composition Assessment Procedures.
      3.6.1. Height Assessment.
         3.6.1.1. Measurement will be taken in the FAC in conjunction with weight and AC
         measurements. Where a FAC does not exist, Unit CCs may designate a location for body
         composition measurements.
         3.6.1.2. Measurement will be taken with member in Air Force PT t-shirt, PT shorts
         and/or PT pants. Air Force PT jacket and shoes will not be worn during measurements.
         3.6.1.3. Member will stand on a flat surface with the head held horizontal looking
         directly forward, and the chin parallel with the floor. The body should be straight, but
         not rigid, similar to the body position when at attention.
         3.6.1.4. Measurement will be recorded to the nearest inch.
             3.6.1.4.1. If the height fraction is less than ½ inch round down to the nearest inch.
             3.6.1.4.2. If the height fraction is ½ inch or greater round up to the nearest inch.
      3.6.2. Weight Assessment.
         3.6.2.1. The measurement will be made on a scale calibrated IAW TO 33K-1-100-1,
         Section 3, Technical Manual on Calibration Procedure for Maintenance Data Collection
         Codes and Calibration Measurement Summaries, and recorded to the nearest pound with
         the following guidance.
         3.6.2.2. If the weight fraction is less than ½ pound, round down to the nearest pound.
         3.6.2.3. If the weight fraction is ½ pound or greater, round up to the nearest pound.
         3.6.2.4. Two pounds will be subtracted for clothing worn during official FA.
   3.6.3. Abdominal Circumference (AC) Assessment.
         3.6.3.1. FAC staff or trained augmentee will take the AC measurement in a private room
         or in a partitioned area. Individuals conducting AC measurements will be of the same
         gender as the member being taped. Where a FAC member or a PTL of the same gender
         is not available, an observer of the same gender must be present.
         3.6.3.2. Tape measure made of non-stretch (fiberglass) material will be used for the AC
         measurement.
         3.6.3.3. The tester will start the measurement on the right side of the Airman. The tester
         will locate the measurement landmark immediately above the right uppermost hip bone
         (superior border of the iliac crest) at the side of the body vertically in line with the right
         armpit (midaxillary line). If desired, the Airman may assist the tester in locating the
         measurement landmark by resting the right hand on the hip, using rearward facing right
         thumb to locate the iliac crest. The tester will determine final horizontal - vertical
         intersection point for landmark confirmation.
AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013                       27


      3.6.3.4. The Airman will stand on a flat surface with feet no more than shoulder width
      apart. The head should be horizontal, looking directly forward with the chin parallel to
      the floor. The Airman may use one hand to initially assist the tester in anchoring the tape
      measure to the body, but must remove the hand from the tape measure before the official
      measurement is recorded. Measurement will be taken on bare skin. The free hand may
      be used to hold the shirt out of the way, but no part of the hands or arms may extend
      above the shoulders.

Figure 3.1. Measuring Tape Position for Abdominal Circumference.




      3.6.3.5. The Airman will remain stationary while the tester conducts the measurement by
      initially moving around the Airman to place the tape in a horizontal plane around the
      abdomen (Figure 3.1). The tester will ensure tape is parallel to the floor at the level of
      the landmark (bottom edge of the tape just contacts landmark), is snug, but does not
      compress the bare skin. The tester will take the measurement at the end of the Airman’s
      normal respiration.
      3.6.3.6. The tester will take the circumference measure three times and record each
      measurement rounding down to the nearest ½ inch. If any of the measures differ by more
      than one inch from the other two, the tester will take an additional measurement. The
      tester will add the three closest measurements, divide by three, and round down to the
      nearest ½ inch. The tester will record this value as the AC measurement.
   3.6.3.7. If an Airman fails the abdominal circumference measurement of the Fitness
   Assessment (FA) yet takes and passes the other three components with a score of at least 75
   points of the remaining 80 points, the FAC will administer the DoD prescribed Body Mass
   Index (BMI) screen. If the Airman passes the BMI screen, the Airman passes the body
   composition component of the fitness assessment. If the Airman does not pass the BMI
   screen, the Airman will receive a Body Fat Assessment (BFA). If the Airman passes the
   BFA, the Airman passes the body composition component of the fitness assessment. If the
   Airman fails the BFA, the Airman fails the body composition component of the fitness
   assessment.
 28           AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013


         3.6.3.7.1. If an eligible Airman passes either the BMI screen or BFA, the Airman Passes
         the FA and will be marked “Exempt” in AFFMS for the AC measurement, but all other
         scores will be recorded as tested. To properly track these instances, the FAC manager
         will submit an exception to policy (ETP) letter (refer to Attachment 22) within two duty
         days to AFPC/DPSIM (DPSIM.orgbox@randolph.af.mil) if an Airman qualifies to take
         and passes either the BMI screen or the BFA. The AC measurement, BMI score, and
         BFA (if performed) will be provided in the letter.
         3.6.3.7.2. Airmen who take the alternate aerobic component (2.0 kilometer walk-test), or
         are exempt from any other component, are ineligible to take the BMI screen and BFA.
   3.6.4. Body Mass Index (BMI) Screen
   3.6.4.1. The tester will perform the BMI screen after all other components of the fitness
   assessment have been accomplished
         3.6.4.2. The tester will use the height and weight mesurements obtained earlier in the
         fitness assessment. To pass the BMI the Airmen, regaurdless of age or gender shall not
         exceed the maximum BMI of 25 kg/m2. Refer to the BMI chart at Attachment 13.
      3.6.5. Body Fat Assessment (BFA)
         3.6.5.1. The BFA will be performed by the FAC Manager, FAC staff, or an alternate.
         The FAC Manager must approve all alternates and ensure enough alternates are
         appointed to handle the needs of each specific location.
         3.6.5.2. The FAC Manager approved tester will perform the BFA using a 2-site taping
         (neck and waist) for males or a 3-site taping (neck, waist, hip) for females. Refer to
         Attachment 19 for instructions.
         3.6.5.3. To pass the BFA, a female Airman must achieve a body fat percentage equal to
         or lower than 26%. A male Airman must achieve a BFA equal to or lower than 18%.
         Refer to Attachments 20 and 21 for score tables.
3.7. Aerobic Fitness Assessment.
      3.7.1. The run and walk will be performed on an approved distance course.
         3.7.1.1. When the run is performed at elevation levels of 5,250 feet and higher, refer to
         the altitude adjustment chart at Attachment 17.
      3.7.2. Aerobic fitness is measured with a 1.5-mile run according to procedures outlined in
      Attachment 5. Test administrator will read verbal instructions to those performing 1.5 mile
      run at A5.5. All members will complete the 1.5-mile timed run unless medically exempted.
   3.7.3. Members medically exempted from the run and cleared for an alternate assessment
   will, upon recommendation by the clinical provider/FPM/MLO, complete the 2.0-kilometer
   walk, according to procedures in Attachment 11. Members performing the 2.0-kilometer
   walk will not be allowed to run (i.e., at least one foot must be in contact with the ground at
   all times) or the assessment will be terminated. Test administrator will read verbal
   instructions to those performing 2.0 kilometer walk at A5.6.
         3.7.3.1. The 2.0-kilometer walk is the only authorized alternate assessment. NOTE:
         Airmen do not select the aerobic assessment method. The clinical provider/FPM/MLO
AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013                       29


      determines which assessment to use based on the member’s assessment history and
      medical recommendation as documented on the AF Form 469.
3.8. Muscular Fitness Assessment.
   3.8.1. Muscular fitness is measured with a 1-minute timed push-up component and a 1-
   minute timed sit-up component. Assessment procedures and techniques are outlined in
   Attachment 5. FAC augmentees will demonstrate proper push-ups and sit-ups prior to
   administering the FA unless the instructional video is shown. The FAC is the authority on
   standards and procedures; they will address all discrepancies and will provide indisputable on
   the spot correction.
   3.8.2. Push-Up Component: Purpose. The push-up is used to assess the member’s upper
   body muscular fitness.
      3.8.2.1. Assessment Duration. Members have 1 minute to complete as many correct
      push-ups as possible.
      3.8.2.2. Assessment Explanation. The test assessor must read the push-up script to the
      member and demonstrate proper technique (A5.3) or may show the Air Force
      instructional video. If the instructional video is shown, script reading and demonstration
      is      not      required.            This       video      can      be      found      at:
      http://www.afpc.af.mil/affitnessprogram/index.asp.
      3.8.2.3. Starting Position. The member will begin in the starting position with hands
      slightly wider than shoulder width apart, palms or fists on the floor with arms fully
      extended and the body in a straight line from head to heel. The feet may be no more than
      12 inches apart. The member may rest in the up position only. The member may remove
      their hands or feet from the floor, or bridge or bow their back, but only in the up/rest
      position. The body should maintain a rigid form from head to heel. The feet may not be
      supported or braced (e.g., no crossing of the feet).
      3.8.2.4. Complete Push-up. From the starting position (elbows extended), the member
      will lower the body to the ground until the upper arm is at least parallel to the floor
      (elbow bent at least 90 degrees or less) before pushing back up to the starting position
      (the chest may touch but not rest on or bounce off the floor). The member completes one
      full push-up after returning to the starting position with elbows fully extended. It is
      important to monitor the member’s form and make sure the body does not bow at the
      waist as the member tires. The body must remain rigid during the assessment (the back
      must remain straight unless resting). Incorrect push-ups (e.g., member does not lower
      body until upper arm is at least parallel to the floor, member does not fully extend elbows
      when returning to starting position, body bows at the waist, etc.) will not be counted. If
      an incorrect push-up is performed, assessor will repeat the number of the last correct
      push-up and explain what is being done incorrectly. Member may rest in the up position
      only. If member rests in the down position with their body on the ground, the push-up
      component of the test will be terminated.
      3.8.2.5. Stopwatch. The test assessor is responsible for operating the stopwatch. The
      assessor will start the stopwatch when the member(s) is/are instructed to begin, observe
      the assessment and notify the member how much time is remaining at 30 seconds and 15
      seconds. Prior to beginning the assessment the assessor will inform the members to
30        AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013


     continue to perform push-ups until directed to stop or until the member is no longer able
     to continue.
     3.8.2.6. Counting/Monitoring. FAC augmentee or another member paired to accomplish
     muscle fitness components will monitor and count the correct number of push-ups.
     When members are paired off for the assessment, the FAC will oversee and spot-check
     technique to ensure accurate and safe assessment. The counter/monitor will count the
     number of push-ups out loud. If the member breaks correct form, the FAC
     staff/augmentee repeats the last correct number (e.g., one, two, three, three, four, etc.), as
     well as gives instruction on what was done incorrectly (e.g., you are not extending your
     arms fully, keep your back straight, etc.). Counter and FAC staff/augmentee will monitor
     the member from a position that allows observance of the member’s form and the arm
     angles.
     3.8.2.7. Completion/Recording. Upon completion of the assessment, record the total
     number of correct push-ups.
 3.8.3. Sit-Up Component Purpose. The sit-up component is used to assess a member’s
 muscular fitness.
     3.8.3.1. Assessment Duration. The member will have 1 minute to complete as many
     correct sit-ups as possible
     3.8.3.2. Assessment Explanation. The test assessor will read the sit-up script to the
     member (A5.4) and demonstrate proper technique or may illustrate using the Air Force
     instructional video. If the instructional video is shown, script reading and demonstration
     is       not      required.        This       video      can        be      found       at:
     http://www.afpc.af.mil/affitnessprogram/index.asp.
     3.8.3.3. Starting Position. The use of a mat is optional. The member will be instructed
     to lie face up on the floor/mat. In the starting position, the member’s feet may extend off
     the mat, but the buttocks, shoulders, and head must not extend beyond the mat. The
     member’s knees will be bent at a 90 degree angle (throughout the assessment), with the
     feet or heels in contact with the floor at all times. The member’s arms will be crossed
     over the chest with the hands/fingers on the shoulders or resting on the upper chest.
     3.8.3.4. Foot Hold. The member’s heels must remain anchored to the floor throughout
     the assessment. The member may request to have their feet held down with the hands or
     by putting knees on feet but the monitor may not anchor the member’s legs by holding
     onto the calves or stand on the feet during the assessment. Enough force must be applied
     to keep the feet/ankles from rising while the sit-ups are being accomplished. If member
     requests a member of the same gender to hold their feet, they must be granted that
     request. In place of a monitor holding the feet, a bolted non-portable toe-hold bar may be
     used (where available) to anchor the feet so long as the member’s heels remain in contact
     with the ground at all times and the bar cannot move.
     3.8.3.5. Complete Sit-up. A complete sit-up is accomplished when the upper torso of the
     member is raised off the floor/mat, the elbows touch the knees or thighs, and the upper
     torso is lowered back to the floor/mat until the shoulder blades touch the floor/mat.
     Elbows must touch the knees or thighs at the top of the sit-up, and the shoulder blades
     must touch the floor/mat at the bottom of the sit-up. Any part of your hands/fingers must
AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013                         31


       remain in contact with your shoulders/upper chest at all times. Incorrect sit-ups (e.g.,
       elbows do not touch the knees or thighs at the top of the sit-up, shoulder blades do not
       touch the floor/mat at the bottom of the sit- up, hands/fingers lift completely off the
       shoulders/upper chest, etc.) will not be counted. If an incorrect sit-up is performed,
       assessor will repeat the number of the last correct sit-up and explain what is being done
       incorrectly. The member may only rest in the up position. If the member rests in the
       down position or holds onto their knees/legs while in the up position, the sit-up
       component of the assessment will be terminated.
       3.8.3.6. Stopwatch. The assessor is responsible for operating the stopwatch. The
       assessor will start the stopwatch when the member(s) is/are instructed to begin, observe
       the assessment and notify the member how much time is remaining at 30 seconds and 15
       seconds. Prior to beginning the assessment the assessor will inform the members to
       continue to perform sit-ups until directed to stop or until the member is no longer able to
       continue.
       3.8.3.7. Counting/Monitoring. The FAC augmentee or another member paired to
       accomplish muscle fitness components will monitor and count the correct number of sit-
       ups. When members are paired off for the assessment, the FAC will oversee and spot-
       check technique to ensure accurate and safe assessment. The counter will count the
       number of sit-ups out loud. If the member breaks correct form, the FAC staff/augmentee
       repeats the last correct number (e.g., one, two, three, three, four, etc.), as well as gives
       instruction on what was done incorrectly (e.g., your shoulder blades are not touching the
       mat/floor, keep your hands on your shoulders or chest, etc.). Counter and FAC
       staff/augmentee will monitor the member from a position that allows observance to
       ensure the shoulder blades touch the floor and elbows touch the knees or thighs.
       3.8.3.8. Completion/Recording: upon completion of the assessment, record the total
       number of correct sit-ups.
3.9. Fitness Categories.
   3.9.1. Excellent. Composite score ≥ 90 and minimums met.
   3.9.2. Satisfactory. Composite score of 75 - 89.99 and minimums met.
   3.9.3. Unsatisfactory. Composite score < 75 and/or one or more component minimums
   not met.
   3.9.4. Exempt. Airmen must be exempt in all four components to be entered exempt in
   AFFMS. For deployment/extended TDY purposes, Airmen must be categorized as
   Excellent, Satisfactory, or Unsatisfactory before being updated as exempt in AFFMS.
3.10. Determining Composite Fitness Score.
   3.10.1. Age and gender-specific fitness score charts are provided in Attachments 10 and 12.
   3.10.2. Members will receive a composite score on a 0 to 100 scale based on the following
   maximum component scores: 60 points for aerobic, 20 points for body composition, 10
   points for push-ups and 10 points for sit-ups.
   3.10.3. Determine the score by the following formula in Figure 3.2:
 32        AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013


Figure 3.2. Composite Fitness Score Formula.
                                                  Total component points achieved X 100
             Composite score =
                                                           Total possible points
Component:          Aerobic         Body Composition      Push-ups        Sit-ups

Possible Points:    60              20                       10              10

   3.10.4. Scoring for exemptions: Members with an AF Form 469 prohibiting them from
   performing one or more components of the FA will have a composite score calculated on the
   assessed components. AC will be performed on all members, unless exempted by medical
   provider IAW paragraph 5.2, since there is no risk to the member. Members must achieve a
   minimum of 75 adjusted points, based on points available, and meet minimum component
   standards in order to receive a Satisfactory rating.
       3.10.4.1. Example: Member exempted from push-ups: If member receives 48 pts for
       aerobic fitness, 16 pts for AC and 8 pts for sit-up component; the total component pts
       achieved = 72. Possible pts from aerobic fitness, AC, and sit-up components = 90 pts.
       Composite score is: (72/90) x 100 = 80 pts. As long as member meets component
       minimums, member receives a Satisfactory rating.
       3.10.4.2. Example: Member exempted from aerobic fitness: If member has a 39.5 inch
       waist and receives 11.7 pts for AC, 9.5 pts for push-ups and 9.5 pts for sit-up component;
       the total component pts achieved = 30.7. Possible pts from AC, push-up and sit-up
       components = 40 points. Composite score is: (30.7/40) x 100 = 77 points. However,
       based on minimum component score (because member did not meet minimum AC
       requirement of 39.0 inches), member receives an Unsatisfactory rating.
       3.10.4.3. Members testing on AC-only: Airmen testing on just the AC are only required
       to meet the minimum component standard in this area to pass the assessment. As such,
       an AC of ≤39.0 for males and 35.5 for females will result in a Satisfactory. NOTE: All
       measurements between the AC target and minimum will yield an overall FA score of
       75.0 (e.g., Male: AC of 38.0 – 39.0 = 75.0 points & Female: AC of 34.5 – 35.5 = 75.0
       points).
3.11. Scheduling.
   3.11.1. Frequency of the FA will be based on the previous fitness score unless earlier
   assessment is necessary to accommodate TDY, PME or other training courses, PCS moves,
   leave schedules or other situations that would preclude member from maintaining fitness
   currency. Commanders may not direct out of cycle official FAs. Airmen may volunteer to
   take a fitness assessment early at their own discretion.
       3.11.1.1. Excellent. All Airmen will test by the last day of the month, 12 calendar
       months following the previous Excellent test as outlined above. NOTE: Member must
       have earned an Excellent by completing all four FA components (aerobic: 1.5 mile run;
       AC measurement; push-ups; and sit-ups) in order to test on a 12 month currency cycle.
       Members who take the walk test are ineligible to take the fitness assessment on an annual
       basis and will test by the last day of the month, six calendar months following the
       previous Satisfactory test.

       3.11.1.2. Satisfactory. RegAF, AFR, and NGB (Title 10/Statutory Tour) members who
       score a Satisfactory score on their FA are mandated to complete an official FA at a
       minimum of twice per year. RegAF, AFR, and NGB (Title 10/Statutory Tour) members
       with a current Satisfactory FA will test by the last day of the month, six calendar months
       following the previous Satisfactory test (e.g., if member tested on 15 April, then member
       must retest on/before 31 October of the same year). ANG Title 32 are mandated to
       complete an official FA at a minimum of once yearly and must be tested by the last day
       of the month, 12 calendar months following the previous Satisfactory test, even if the
       administered test included one or more component exemptions (e.g., if a member tested
       on 15 April, the member must retest on/before 30 April of the following year).
       3.11.1.3. Unsatisfactory. RegAF, AFR, and NGB (Title 10/Statutory Tour) Airmen
       must retest within 90 days following an Unsatisfactory FA. Unit Commanders may not
       mandate Airmen to retest any sooner than the end of the 90-day reconditioning period;
       however, Airmen may volunteer to do so. Retesting in the first 42 days after an
       Unsatisfactory FA is not recommended since recognized medical guidance recommends
       42 days as the minimum timeframe to recondition from Unsatisfactory to Satisfactory
       status in a manner that reduces risk of injury. It is the Airman's responsibility to ensure
       he/she retests before the 90-day reconditioning period expires as non-currency begins on
       the 91st day. NGB Title 32 must retest within 180 days following an Unsatisfactory FA.
       Unit Commanders may not mandate NGB Title 32 Airmen retest any sooner than the end
       of the 180-day reconditioning period; however, Airmen may volunteer to do so. Non-
       currency for NGB Title 32 begins on the 181st day.
          3.11.1.3.1. Airman who want to retest during the 42-day period (90 days for ANG
          Title 32) immediately following an Unsatisfactory FA are highly encourage to
          complete an unofficial practice FA (administered by a unit PTL) prior to scheduling
          their official FA. If an Airman disregards this recommendation, the FA test score will
          still count as an official score and be entered in AFFMS.
   3.11.2. In addition to the mandatory official test, commanders may direct unofficial practice
   tests administered by trained/certified PTLs. This will afford members regular opportunities
   to assess their compliance with AF fitness standards, minimizing any surprise assessment
   failures at the time of official assessments. These assessment scores do not require FAC
   presence and will not be entered into AFFMS; however, they may be used as a commander’s
   tool to evaluate fitness/readiness. Tests conducted as unofficial practice tests cannot be
   counted as official.
3.12. Currency. Each Airman is responsible for knowing the block of time within which
his or her Fitness Assessment is required. Currency is established upon completion of the
following program requirements based on the member’s most recent fitness level as described in
paragraph 3.11.
   3.12.1. If a FA has not been scheduled in the period required to remain current, notify the
   designated FAC representative, UFPM, or superior authority, in writing (includes e-mail) of
   the need to schedule the FA and requests that it be scheduled immediately for
   accomplishment within the required window. It is ultimately the member’s responsibility to
   ensure their FA is scheduled.
34        AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013


  3.12.2. Failing to remain current, as well as failing to attain a passing score on the applicable
  fitness test before the end of any performance report reporting period, will result in a "DOES
  NOT MEET STANDARDS" rating on the member’s OPR/EPR if, as of the closeout date of
  any performance report, currency or a passing score is not obtained. Monitor any personal
  FA exemptions, schedule any necessary medical examinations, and initiate FA test
  arrangements in a timely manner.
  3.12.3. Waivers. If a member is unable to complete any required portion of the AF Fitness
  Program (e.g., FA, intervention classes), the member must receive written approval (Table
  5.3) from the Unit CC for rescheduling. A copy of the written approval is filed by the UFPM
  in the member’s fitness program case file. For ARC members unable to complete any
  scheduled FA, the member must be rescheduled to test on the next date the member is in a
  military duty status and official FAs are being conducted.
  3.12.4. Deployments. Members must have a current fitness score on file prior to arrival at
  deployed location. Member will not be considered "exempt" in the deployed location until
  their current FA expires. If a member fails before deploying/extended TDY and their
  OPR/EPR closes out after the deployment starts, member will be marked "DOES NOT
  MEET STANDARDS" on the OPR/EPR. If they pass, they will be marked "MEETS
  STANDARDS" on the OPR/EPR. The only time "exempt" will be marked is if their current
  FA "expires" and they are in a deployed location where they CANNOT test or choose not to
  volunteer to test at locations where FA testing is available.
     3.12.4.1. Any failures will be annotated in AFFMS and will be considered against the
     individual. However, if an Airman reaches the 91-day mark after the FA (failure), but
     before the evaluation closes out, the Unsatisfactory score is no longer current and
     therefore the evaluation will be marked "exempt". If an Airman has a current/passing
     score before deploying and his/her evaluation closes out after the deployment starts, the
     Airman will be marked "MEETS STANDARDS". For Satisfactory and Excellent scores,
     deployed Airmen become "exempt" only when they reach the first day of the month,
     seven/thirteen calendar months following the previous official FA rating.
     3.12.4.2. Home station UFPM will notify the FAC to update AFFMS placing the
     deployed member in exempt status after their “current” FA expires. UFPMs performing
     FAC duties at GSUs will update exempt status in AFFMS. NOTE: The end
     date/duration of the deployment exemption should include in the 42-day reconditioning
     period (90 days for non-AGR and Traditional ARC) afforded to all members returning
     from a deployment of greater than 30 days.
     3.12.4.3. Members who are due to take a FA upon return from deployment will be given
     42 days for post deployment reconstitution and training from the date they sign into their
     home unit. UFPMs must communicate with the FAC when members return from
     deployment.
         3.12.4.3.1. RegAF and AGR personnel deployed for greater than 30 consecutive days
         will be given a 42-day acclimatization period starting the date they arrive back at
         homestation prior to taking their FA, unless the member requests to be assessed
         earlier. All non-AGR and Traditional ARC personnel will be given a 90-day
         acclimatization period starting the date they arrive back at homestation prior to taking
         their FA, unless the member requests to be assessed earlier. Member will become

          noncurrent on day 43 (day 91 for non-AGR and Traditional ARC), if applicable.
          NOTE:       OPRs/EPRs that close out during this post deployment 42-day
          reconditioning period will be marked “exempt”.
   3.12.5. Extended TDYs. Members must have a current fitness score prior to arrival at
   extended TDY location. For the purpose of this instruction, extended TDY is defined as
   lasting more than 30 consecutive days. Member will not be considered "exempt" at the
   extended TDY location until their current FA expires. If a member fails the FA before the
   extended TDY and their OPR/EPR closes out while the Unsatisfactory FA score is still
   current, member will be marked "DOES NOT MEET STANDARDS" on the OPR/EPR. If
   they pass a FA before evaluation closes out, they will be marked "MEETS STANDARDS"
   on the OPR/EPR. The only time "exempt" will be marked is if their current FA "expires" at
   the extended TDY location prior to evaluation close out. NOTE: The “Deployment”
   exemption category in AFFMS will be utilized to annotate Airmen whose FA expired during
   an extended TDY.
      3.12.5.1. RegAF and AGR personnel TDY for greater than 30 consecutive days will be
      given a 42-day acclimatization period starting the date they arrive back at homestation
      prior to taking their FA, unless the member requests to be assessed earlier. All non-AGR
      and Traditional ARC personnel will be given a 90-day acclimatization period starting the
      date they arrive back at homestation prior to taking their FA, unless the member requests
      to be assessed earlier. Member will become noncurrent on day 43 (day 91 for non-AGR
      and Traditional ARC), if applicable. NOTE: OPRs/EPRs that close out during this post
      TDY 42-day reconditioning period will be marked “exempt”.
3.13. Unsatisfactory education and intervention.
   3.13.1. RegAF and ARC AGR members must participate in a unit FIP and start the BE
   WELL Program (if co-located, otherwise online) within 10 days of the failed FA. All
   members in the Unsatisfactory fitness category will remain in the FIP/SFIP until they achieve
   a Satisfactory or Excellent FA score.
      3.13.1.1. RegAF GSU members at non-collocated Air Force bases will start the BE
      WELL Program within 10 days of the FA. The online BE WELL Program is available
      via ADLS.
      3.13.1.2. Non-AGR ARC (AFR and ANG) must accomplish BE WELL Program within
      60 days of Unsatisfactory FA. If HAWC space allows, non-AGR ARC members at
      collocated Air Force bases may participate in a BE WELL program that involves in-
      person attendance. The online BE WELL Program is available via ADLS.

                           FITNESS ASSESSMENT WAIVERS

4.1. Installations with Extreme Weather Conditions and/or Higher Altitudes.
   4.1.1. Installation CCs may request a waiver from MAJCOM/CV or equivalent (NGB/A1 for
   ANG) to adjust scheduling of the 1.5-mile run or 2.0-kilometer walk assessments for extreme
   seasonal weather conditions (see Attachment 6) if an appropriate indoor facility is not
   available. The waiver must specify periods unable to complete the run/walk assessment
   safely. Any approved installation waiver will be extended to all tenant units physically
   located on the installation. The ARC MAJCOM/CV (or equivalent) that owns the tenant unit
   also has the authority to approve a tenant waiver. Members will still test on remaining
   components and will be granted an exemption from the aerobic component of the test for the
   time period specified in the approved waiver. RegAF, Title 10 Statutory Tour and ARC
   AGR members will be required to test again in 6-months, even if they score 90 or above.
   Member’s composite score will be determined in accordance with paragraph 3.10.
      4.1.1.1. MAJCOM/A1s will forward a copy of approved waivers to AF/A1PP. For ARC
      stand-alone installations, AFRC/A1 and ANG/A1 will forward a copy of approved
      waivers to AF/A1PP.
   4.1.2. ARC members who commute from a lower altitude to perform duty at their
   assigned/attached unit at a location where the altitude ≥ 5,250 feet, may perform FA with an
   AF unit at or near their home altitude, with commander’s approval. The UFPM at the unit of
   assessment will forward a copy of FA results to ARC member’s assigned/attached UFPM for
   AFFMS update and tracking purposes. This variation is only for ARC members who are not
   afforded the 42-day acclimatization period at the assessment site.

                                       EXEMPTIONS

5.1. General. Exemptions are designed to categorize members as unable or unavailable to train
or assess for a limited time period. Exemptions, for medical reasons, are entered into AFFMS
using the current AF Form 469 following FA completion.
5.2. Exemptions. Commanders may grant exemptions as outlined in Table 5.3 Members with
exemptions prohibiting them from performing one or more components of the FA will be
assessed on the remaining components and scored IAW paragraph 3.10. Fitness testing
exemption recommendations for medical reasons can only be made by a MTF provider or ANG
MLO. All members will complete an AC assessment as listed in paragraph 5.2.5., unless they
have a Deployment Availability Working Group (DAWG) approved exemption for a condition
that the MTF provider/FPM/MLO deems would warrant AC assessment exemption. Temporary
exemptions will not be issued for personnel still currently assigned to a unit solely for the
purpose of improving currency compliance rates (i.e. impending retirements, separations, etc.
where member is not on terminal leave).
   5.2.1. Members with chronic medical DLCs preventing them from performing one or more
   components of the FA will be medically reviewed during the annual PHA, at a minimum,
   and referred to the DAWG for evaluation as appropriate IAW AFI 10-203, AFI 48-123,
   Medical Examinations and Standards, and AFI 41-210, Patient Administrative Functions.
   5.2.2. The UFPM will identify Airmen who have had four component exemptions in a 24-
   month period. The UPFM will notify the Unit Commander, who will, in turn, request the
   EP/Wing FPM/ARC MLO review the case at the DAWG. The DAWG will review and
   evaluate the member’s medical history and determine the best course of action IAW AFI 10-
   203.
Example: An Airman who was exempt from sit-ups in Apr 10 FA, exempt from sit-ups and
push-ups in Oct 10 FA, exempt from 1.5 mile run/1.0-mile walk in Apr 11 FA and exempt from
sit-ups in Oct 11 FA must be recommended by the Unit Commander for review at the DAWG.
       5.2.2.1. Providers will list physical limitations and FA exemptions on the AF Form 469.
       When warranted, provider will refer the member to the EP/FPM for an exercise
       assessment, prescription and counseling, or reconditioning program. Unless given a
       composite exemption, member will continue to prepare for and be assessed on non-
       exempt components of the FA.
          5.2.2.1.1. ANG. Members with physical limitation that prevent participation in
          fitness activities for greater than 30 days and/or preclude the members from
          completing a full FA will provide medical documentation from their Personal Care
          Provider (PCP) to the Wing Medical Group. The Wing Medical Group will issue an
          AF Form 469 as appropriate addressing each component of the FA. MLO will review
          AF Form 469 and issue an AF Form 422 to the member’s UFPM. UFPM ensures
          members due an FA are assessed on non-exempted components per the AF Form 469.
       5.2.2.2. A military provider must make the final disposition for any physical limitations
       in cases where military members are seen by non-military providers or when ARC
38           AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013


        members bring recommendations from their PCP. Limitations will be transcribed by an
        AF provider to an AF Form 469 IAW AFI 10-203.
        5.2.2.3. The expiration date on the AF Form 469 represents the date the member is
        medically cleared to resume physical activities previously restricted. For DLCs of 30
        days or less, members are eligible to complete a FA when their AF Form 469 restrictions
        expire, and will be tested within 30 days, if due or overdue. For DLCs lasting greater
        than 31 days, members will be eligible to complete the full, four component FA 42 days
        after the expiration date of physical limitations, as annotated on AF Form 469. This
        allows time for reconditioning, if exempted for greater than 30 days. NOTE: Reference
        5.2.3. for guidance regarding pregnant members.
        5.2.2.4. Airmen with an AF Form 469 must maintain FA currency standards. If a
        member is due to test during the AF Form 469 effective dates or 42-day reconditioning
        period, the member will complete the FA components that he/she is cleared to test on per
        the AF Form 469. NOTE: Airmen who are not due to test during the AF Form 469
        effective dates or 42-day reconditioning period to maintain currency may not volunteer to
        take an FA until the 42-day reconditioning period expires.
     5.2.3. Pregnancy.
        5.2.3.1. Provider will include information on physical activity during prenatal
        counseling.
        5.2.3.2. Members will be exempted from FA during pregnancy. Members with
        pregnancies lasting 20 weeks or more are also exempt from FA for 180 days after
        completion of pregnancy (delivery, miscarriage, etc.). Pregnancy-related exemptions are
        only for the FA and do not exclude the member from participating in an EP/FPM-
        approved physical fitness program. EP will counsel pregnant members on maintaining
        fitness during pregnancy (in coordination with Obstetrician). This can be done
        individually or in a group setting.
        5.2.3.3. AF Form 469 will be re-accomplished by the provider (or ANG Wing Medical
        Group) IAW AFI 10-203 in cases where pregnancy ends prior to 20 weeks. Providers
        will take into account physiological and psychological changes when determining days
        required for recovery and reconditioning prior to FA eligibility. EP/MLO will issue
        corresponding AF Form 422 for the duration of the AF Form 469.
            5.2.3.3.1. Expiration date on the AF Form 469 will be determined by the provider
            and represents the date the member is medically cleared to begin an unrestricted
            physical training program.
        5.2.3.4. Pregnant ARC members should discuss their fitness program with their PCP.
     5.2.4. PCS Moves. Airmen are given 42 days from Date Arrive Station (DAS) at new duty
     location to acclimatize before being required to complete an FA. Members pending PCS
     must have a current FA score on file that will not expire through the Report-No- Later-Than-
     Date (RNLTD) and 42-day acclimatization period. If the current FA expires prior to the
     member's RNLTD + 42 days, the Airman must complete a FA before departing their losing
     duty station. Exemptions will not be granted for members in outbound status for any
     circumstance other than those addressed in paragraphs 5.2.4.1. and 5.2.4.2.

      5.2.4.1. Airmen returning from a deployment who PCS before the end of their 42-day
      post deployment acclimatization period will have their deployment exemption duration
      extended by the losing homestation to cover the additional 42 days they will receive post
      RNLTD to acclimatize. To prevent going non-current, Airman will test 43 days
      following RNLTD. NOTE: Not applicable if member’s FA remains current for 43 days
      post RNLTD.
      5.2.4.1.1. Airmen who are due to PCS following the completion of the post-deployment
      acclimatization period must complete an FA if their FA is already expired or expires
      anytime prior to RNLTD + 42 days.
      5.2.4.2. Airmen returning from an extended TDY (> 30 consecutive days) who PCS
      before the end of their post-TDY 42-day acclimatization period will be granted a
      composite “deployment exemption” by losing homestation. This exemption will only be
      awarded upon expiration of the Airman’s current FA. Exemption duration will not
      exceed RNLTD + 42 days. NOTE: Not applicable if member’s FA remains current for
      43 days post RNLTD.
          5.2.4.2.1. Airmen who are due to PCS following the completion of the post-TDY
          acclimatization period must complete an FA if their FA is already expired or expires
          anytime prior to RNLTD + 42 days.
      5.2.4.3. Airmen may volunteer to test during either the post-deployment/extended TDY
      or RNLTD acclimatization period but cannot be directed to do so.
   5.2.5. Accessions. Officer accessions will be given 42-days from their DAS to acclimatize,
   but will test NLT 6 months following DAS. DAS may include tech school or their first duty
   location.
   5.2.6. Personnel who are TDY for greater than 30 consecutive days will be given a 42-day
   acclimatization period prior to being required to complete their FA.
   5.2.7. All members will complete AC assessment unless there is a composite exemption or,
   under rare medical circumstances (e.g., abdominal surgery), an AC component exemption is
   recommended by a medical provider/FPM/MLO and approved by the DAWG.
      5.2.7.1. The DAWG reviews all non-pregnancy related AC exemption requests. AC
      component exemptions will not be granted for non-medical reasons (e.g., physique that
      nonetheless has AC that exceeds AF standards). The presence of a rare medical issue is
      the only consideration required/allowed to grant an AC exemption; no other methods
      such as alternative body composition measurements shall be used to determine whether to
      grant an AC exemption.
   5.2.8. ARC medical unit providers will advise members to consult their PCP to recommend
   specific PT appropriate for medical condition or may refer the member to BE WELL
   Program if available. MTFs can provide space available evaluation as required for eligible
   ARC members. To obtain an exemption based on evaluation and recommendation of PCP,
   the member must provide the ARC medical unit with medical documentation to include
   diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and period and type of physical limitations or restrictions.
   Individual Reservists (IR) may be referred by the MTF to their PCP or ARC EP where
   applicable.

   5.2.9. AF/A1PP may approve, on a case-by-case basis, OCONUS FA waivers when it is cost
   prohibitive to travel to the nearest testing facility.
5.3. Exemption Categories.
   5.3.1. Composite Exemptions. Member is exempt from all components of the FA.
   5.3.2. Component Exemption. Member is exempt from one or more components of the FA,
   but will be assessed on remaining components.
       5.3.2.1. Composite Deployment Exemption. Airmen deployed for less than one year on
       Contingency Exercise Deployment (CED) or Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA)
       orders in direct support of a contingency will receive a composite deployment exemption
       following the expiration of their current FA in the deployed location. Permanent party
       and 365-day deployers will also be marked exempt when their current FA expires in the
       deployed location, unless the Air Component Commander mandates continued fitness
       testing IAW the requirements of this AFI. If continued testing for the 365-day deployers
       and permanent party personnel is mandated, the Air Component Commander must grant
       a composite deployment exemption to all individuals deployed to a location not

       PHYSICAL FITNESS AND NUTRITION EDUCATION/INTERVENTION

6.1. Physical Fitness and Nutrition Education. Physical fitness and nutrition education will
be incorporated into training programs and unit PT. Ongoing commander emphasis and a
supportive environment are essential to maintain health and fitness of the force.
6.2. Balanced Eating, Workout Effectively, Live Long Program (BE WELL). This program
targets nutritional and exercise behavior changes necessary to improve one’s health and fitness
utilizing five intervention options. Airmen and their commanders select an option appropriate to
their fitness improvement requirements. Available options include: BE WELL online, a Healthy
Weight program, a cardiovascular intervention, a strength intervention, and Military OneSource
Health Coaching. BE WELL is mandatory for all AF members with an Unsatisfactory FA score
and is available for any member who wish to improve their overall health and fitness.
   6.2.1. RegAF, Title 10 Statutory Tour and ARC AGR members must start BE WELL within
   10 duty days of their Unsatisfactory FA. If members are unable to start within 10 duty days,
   they must obtain written authorization from their Unit Commander. Traditional ARC
   personnel (except AGRs) are required to accomplish BE WELL within 60 days of the
   Unsatisfactory FA.
   6.2.2. Additional sessions on a variety of fitness and nutrition topics are available for
   members who want further guidance.
   6.2.3. Airmen who receive consecutive Unsatisfactory FAs are required to re-enroll in the
   BE WELL Program. Additionally, Airmen who receive nonconsecutive Unsatisfactory FAs
   must start BE WELL within 10 days of their latest Unsatisfactory FA.
   6.2.4. UFPM will inform Airmen of BE WELL program requirements per AFMOA
   guidance and document BE WELL program start date in AFFMS.
   6.2.5. Airmen who retest within 10 duty days of their Unsatisfactory FA and achieve an
   Excellent/Satisfactory score are not required to complete BE WELL.
   6.2.6. Members are ultimately responsible for improving their fitness level to achieve a
   minimum Satisfactory FA score, and if appropriate, provide documentation of compliance
   with BE WELL program to their leadership.

                                SPECIAL POPULATIONS

7.1. Students/Accessions: Commanders, Superintendents, or Commandants of units such as the
USAFA, BMT, Advanced Technical Training Centers, Undergraduate Pilot and Navigator
Training Centers, ROTC, Graduate Medical Education, and Air Force Institute of Technology
(AFIT) education programs will align minimum FA standards with AFI 36-2905. A current FA
composite score of ≥ 75 and meeting all component minimums are required for all students to
graduate from or obtain a commission/enlistment through USAFA, ROTC, OTS, Academy of
Military Science, or BMT. Due to short duration of training, this does not include students
graduating Commissioning Officer Training (COT).
   7.1.1. Officer accessions will be given at least 42-days from their Date Arrive Station (DAS)
   to acclimatize, but will test NLT 6 months from DAS. DAS may include tech school or their
   first duty location.
      7.1.1.1. FAs administered at commissioning sources are not considered official and will
      not be recorded in AFFMS.
   7.1.2. Developmental Education Students (i.e. AFIT, EWI, Joint PME and students in other
   civilian institutions) will participate in FAs conducted by local ROTC detachments where
   available, or base of servicing FAC or other arrangements as determined by the assigned
   commander. Results of FAs will be entered into AFFMS. Where a FAC does not exist,
   UFPMs and PTLs will fulfill the role of the FAC.
   7.1.3. BMT Airmen and Technical Training students will complete official FAs via training
   cadre PTLs/MTLs. The last FA administered at BMT will count as an Enlisted Airman’s
   first official FA for AFFMS input. Graduated BMT Airmen will hand carry FA AF Form
   4446 for input into AFFMS by the FAC at their first duty station or technical training
   (MTL/UFPM), whichever location they report to first. Technical Training students attending
   follow-on training that may result in an FA cycle testing requirement (six months) will be
   tested by a PTL/MTL. Airmen/UFPMs must be aware of the 42-day acclimatization period
   and leave en route duration to determine which base will conduct the FA to ensure Airmen
   remain current.
      7.1.3.1. Enlistees will be given two assessment opportunities on baseline minimum
      aerobic and body composition standards upon arrival at BMT. The failure to meet either:
      1) aerobic fitness standards of: 1.5 mile run time of 18:30 male, 21:35 female, or 2) body
      composition standards of: maximum abdominal circumference of 39.0 inches male, 35.5
      inches female or maximum body fat of 20% male, 28% female, upon arrival at BMT
      deems them physically unable to safely rehabilitate to a passing FA score within the
      standard 42-day rehabilitation period. Two-time failures under the standards in this
      paragraph may be immediately processed for entry level separation pursuant to AFI 36-
      3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen, para 5.22.
   7.1.4. Technical Training school students will complete official FAs via unit PTLs/MTLs as
   required to maintain currency IAW Chapter 3. Results from FAs conducted at technical
   training schools (not BMT) will be input by training squadron UFPMs into AFFMS. All

   permanent party training unit personnel (i.e. cadre, instructors, etc.) will complete FAs via
   the FAC.
7.2. Geographically Separated Units (GSUs)/Individuals.
   7.2.1. Members will complete all components of the FA.
       7.2.1.1. Where no FAC exists, UFPM and/or PTL will fulfill the roles of the FAC.
       However, GSU commanders who choose to utilize UFPMs and/or PTLs to conduct FAs
       will obtain written approval from their owning MAJCOM A1. Prior to performing
       official FAs via unit PTLs, GSU commanders must ensure all PTLs have obtained a
       minimum PTL-B certification from the servicing FSS. Alternatively, members will work
       with their unit CC to accomplish the FA at an alternate location where a FAC is
       available. Unit TDY funds may be used if necessary.
       7.2.1.2. The host base will provide fitness program support.
       7.2.1.3. For AFRC GSUs, the AFRC FPM and supporting FSS units will provide support
       to UFPMs and commanders. HQ AFRC FPM will support UFPMs at DRUs that report
       directly to AFRC or a Numbered Air Force.
       7.2.1.4. ANG GSUs. Commanders will provide UFPMs/PTLs to conduct FAs.
       7.2.1.5. In unique circumstances (e.g., only one AF member at a location), the unit CC
       may authorize a non-AF person to conduct FAs. This individual must be PTL-B certified
       to conduct the FA. A commander may coordinate with the nearest AF base FSS to train
       and certify non-AF personnel to become PTL-B certified. Results of the FA will be
       entered in the AFFMS by FAC personnel at the parent organization.
7.3. Individual Reservists (IR).
   7.3.1. The attached/assigned RegAF unit is responsible for management of the FP for IRs.
   7.3.2. Program managers and Base Individual Mobilization Augmentee Administrator
   (BIMAA) will monitor the timely completion of FP requirements with the attached/assigned
   RegAF unit and the IR, and will provide FA expiration dates if not accessible by the
   attached/assigned RegAF unit.
   7.3.3. Members will be assessed by the attached/assigned RegAF unit during the member’s
   AT, if possible, or during an Inactive Duty Training (IDT) period. Members will contact the
   RegAF UFPM to schedule the FA.
       7.3.3.1. IRs who perform duty at a location outside their commuting area may perform
       their FA with an AF unit at or near their home, with RegAF commander’s approval. The
       member’s RegAF UFPM will coordinate a test date/time with the FAC at the AF unit that
       will be conducting the FA. The FAC conducting the FA will forward or input the test
       results into AFFMS and forward a copy to the owning FAC and UFPM.
   7.3.4. Members must be in a military duty status during assessment IAW paragraph 2.31.8.
   7.3.5. ARC members may not apply personal physical fitness activities for the purpose of
   obtaining participation credit for AT, UTA, IDT, or additional training periods.

   7.3.6. All Participating Individual Ready Reserve (PIRR) members in the Civil Air Patrol
   United States Air Force (CAP-USAF) and Air Liaison Officer (ALO) programs are
   authorized to perform the FA only once per year.
7.4. Air Reserve Component (ARC) Tenant Support at Active Duty Installations.
   7.4.1. ARC tenants will utilize host FAC to support official FAs at collocated installations.
   FACs must coordinate and provide full operational support for ARC tenant units to conduct
   FAs on UTA weekends, as well as support other ARC members who are available for testing
   during the week.
      7.4.1.1. If host FAC cannot provide the appropriate number of FAC augmentees to fully
      support weekend ARC testing requirements, FAC may request ARC tenant unit provide
      PTLs to augment FAC and conduct weekend FAs. If augmentation is required, a ratio of
      1 host FAC member to 4 ARC augmentees must be maintained during FAs. Tenant ARC
      units should provide testing schedule/requirements to host FAC a minimum of 60 days
      prior to UTA weekends. FAC must request augmentation support a minimum of 45 days
      prior to the UTA. NOTE: When augmenting the FAC, ARC PTLs will not test
      members from their own unit/PAS code.
      7.4.1.2. ARC tenant wings at Active Duty bases may conduct their own fitness
      assessments on UTA weekends contingent upon agreement between Host Wing/CC and
      ARC Wing/CC. If approved, testing will be overseen by the Wing Fitness Program
      Manager (FPM). Additionally, FPM will ensure the ARC PTLs do not test members
      from their own unit/PAS code and do not update FA scores in AFFMS for personnel
      from their own unit/PAS code.
      7.4.1.3. All FAC augmentees must have a minimum PTL-B certification and receive
      refresher FA procedures training prior to administering any FAs.

                                          Chapter 10

                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND PERSONNEL ACTIONS

10.1. Adverse Personnel Actions (for Unsatisfactory Fitness Members). Members are
expected to be in compliance with Air Force fitness standards at all times. When members fail to
comply with those standards (receive an Unsatisfactory FA score), they render themselves
potentially subject to adverse action. Commanders should consult with their servicing Staff
Judge Advocate before taking such action.
   10.1.1. Prohibited Actions:
       10.1.1.1. Commanders may not impose nonjudicial punishment (Article 15, UCMJ)
       solely for failing to achieve a Satisfactory fitness score.
       10.1.1.2. Member is not subject to adverse personnel action for inability to take the FA if
       the member is on a 365-day FA exemption that has been validated by the MTF DAWG.
       10.1.1.3. While units may perform unofficial practice tests for diagnostic purposes, the
       chain of command will refrain from taking adverse action based solely on the results of
       these tests. The ultimate goal of the fitness program is to motivate members to adopt a
       lifestyle of fitness through realization of positive health-benefits from regular exercise
       and good nutrition. Members are more likely to embrace and positively view unit
       practice testing when conducted in the spirit of camaraderie rather than potential
       penalization.
   10.1.2. Unit Commanders or equivalent may take adverse administrative action upon a
   member’s Unsatisfactory fitness score on an official FA (see Attachment 14). For
   administrative separation criteria, see paragraph 10.1.5. below.
       10.1.2.1. If adverse administrative action is not taken in response to an Unsatisfactory
       fitness score on an official FA, unit CCs will document in the member’s fitness case file
       as to why no action is being taken. The lack of such CC documentation does not discount
       the testing failure as a basis in support of administrative discharge action pursuant to
       paragraph 10.1.5.
   10.1.3. As appropriate, unit CCs will document and take corrective action for members’
   unexcused failures to participate in the FP such as failing to accomplish a scheduled FA,
   failing to attend a scheduled fitness appointment, or failing to complete mandatory
   educational intervention. Commanders may use administrative action to document a
   member’s failure to maintain currency.
   10.1.4. For standards and requirements relating to performance report documentation of
   fitness, consult AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems, and other official
   guidance specifically addressing performance reports.
   10.1.5. Administrative Separation. (See AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen,
   for active duty enlisted members, AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures for
   Commissioned Officers, for active duty officers, AFI 36-3209, Separation and Retirement
   Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members, for all ARC members.)
 50        AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013


      10.1.5.1. Unit Commanders must make a discharge or retention recommendation to the
      separation authority (enlisted Airmen), show cause authority (officers), or appropriate
      discharge authority for AFR and ANG members once an Airman receives four
      Unsatisfactory FA scores in a 24-month period and a military medical provider has
      reviewed the Airman’s medical records to rule out medical conditions precluding the
      Airman from achieving a passing score (see Attachment 16 as template). If the
      separation authority (enlisted Airmen), show cause authority (officers), or appropriate
      discharge authority for AFR and ANG members disagrees with the Unit Commander’s
      retention recommendation, discharge action is initiated pursuant to applicable discharge
      instruction.
      10.1.5.2. If an Airman is retained, any subsequent FA failure that re-establishes the basis
      for discharge (i.e., four failures in 24 months based on most recent failure date) requires
      the Unit Commander to initiate a medical records review and submit another discharge or
      retention recommendation. Retention does not prevent previous failures from being
      included in the most recent 24 month period for FA failure count.
          10.1.5.2.1. Retention decision memorandums will be filed in member’s fitness
          program case file.
      10.1.5.3. The 24-month period for discharge/retention recommendation is calculated
      from the most recent Unsatisfactory FA and is measured in months, not days, including
      the month of the most recent failure. For example, if the most recent failure is 15 Jun
      2012, then count the failures in the previous 23 months plus the month of the most recent
      failure (Jun 2012). In this example, the inclusive months in which you must count FA
      failures are Jul 2010 through Jun 2012. Four FA failures anytime in those 24 months
      meets the criteria and would require the Unit Commander to make a discharge or
      retention recommendation, provided the member does not have a medical condition to
      preclude him/her from achieving a passing score. A recommendation for discharge or
      retention will be made regardless of an Airman’s achieving one or multiple passing FAs
      in between the four failures.
      10.1.5.4. Unit Commanders may initiate (enlisted Airmen) or recommend (officers)
      administrative discharge only after the Airman has: received four Unsatisfactory FA
      scores in a 24-month period; failed to demonstrate significant improvement (as
      determined by the commander) despite the reconditioning period; and a military medical
      provider has reviewed the Airman’s medical records to rule out medical conditions
      precluding the member from achieving a passing score.
10.2. Failing to Present a Professional Military Image While in Uniform.
   10.2.1. Commanders must ensure members present a professional military image while in
   uniform. A professional military image/appearance may or may not directly relate to an
   individual’s fitness level or weight.
   10.2.2. Commanders may require individuals who do not present a professional military
   appearance (regardless of overall FA composite score) to enter the FIP (SFIP for ARC)
   and/or otherwise schedule individuals for fitness education and intervention. Commanders
   taking such action:
AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013                        51


      10.2.2.1. Specify in writing, using AF Form 108, the date an individual should complete
      the program and the requirements they must meet.
      10.2.2.2. May extend the exercise program in writing beyond the initial period until the
      participant achieves a professional military appearance.
      10.2.2.3. May take administrative and/or personnel action if the individual fails to
      participate or comply with the requirements established by the Commander.
10.3. Education and Training Programs.
   10.3.1. This instruction does not set eligibility standards for attending PME or other training
   programs. For those standards consult the applicable governing regulations. Personnel
   selected to attend PME may be required to fitness test outside their normal cycle to meet
   eligibility requirements for attending PME. In those situations where members with
   Unsatisfactory FA scores are permitted to attend training, the following rules apply:
      10.3.1.1. Members enrolled in the FIP/SFIP must continue with this program and
      scheduled FAs while in training status.
      10.3.1.2. Commanders sending members enrolled in the FIP to a training TDY that
      exceeds 6 weeks must send the gaining commander or equivalent a memorandum
      explaining the required intervention, follow-up, and testing (Attachment 8) at least 2
      weeks prior to TDY.
      10.3.1.3. The gaining commander or commandant at the TDY location will assume unit
      CC responsibilities for FP purposes.
      10.3.1.4. ARC members in all fitness categories going on active duty orders for training
      must be prepared to participate in PT programs and those in the SFIP must participate in
      the FIP during periods of active duty.
10.4. AF Form 108, Physical Fitness Education and Intervention Processing.
   10.4.1. UFPMs initiate and annotate mandatory BE WELL option(s) and appointments on
   AF Form 108 to include date/time and location.
   10.4.2. Member will sign the AF Form 108 acknowledging BE WELL Program enrollment,
   accepting responsibility for improving their fitness level, completing program requirement
   and if appropriate providing documentation of program compliance.
   10.4.3. Unit Commander or equivalent will use the AF Form 108 as a tool to document
   mandatory education and intervention requirements. The failure of command or command
   representatives to sign, annotate, or otherwise complete the AF Form 108 in no way lessesns
   the member’s overarching responsibility for his/her own fitness and compliance with AF
   Fitness standards.
   10.4.4. Respective program facilitator of the education/intervention program signs the AF
   Form 108 upon completion, when applicable. Program facilitator signature on AF Form 108
   not required for online BE WELL programs. Annotations can be made on the back of the AF
   Form 108 for programs requiring multiple attendance.
   10.4.5. Members with Unsatisfactory scores, or their Commanders, may request a clinical
   case review to determine if there are documented medical conditions that prohibit program
    52        AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013


      success (Attachment 16). This does not require a face to face encounter with the member
      unless determined by the healthcare provider to be clinically indicated. For purposes of the
      Fitness Program, obesity will not be used as a diagnosis prohibiting program success.
      10.4.6. If a member fails to show for any assigned appointments, the FAC and/or Health
      Promotion/medical staff will notify the member’s UFPM who, in turn, will notify the CC for
      appropriate action.
      10.4.7. Barnes Center for Enlisted Education Senior Enlisted Leader ad NCOs assigned duty
      as Detachment Chief or Academy Commandant have signature authority for the AF Form
      108.
10.5. Removing FA Scores from AFFMS.
      10.5.1. If a military member believes the administration of his/her FA or his/her FA score
      was in error or unjust, he/she may submit an appeal to the Wing Commander, or equivalent
      as described in figure 5.1.

Figure 10.1. Fitness Assessment Appeals Process.


Figure 10.1. Fitness Assessment Appeals Process.
Step 1: Member notifies UFPM of potential records error
Step 2: UFPM collects a Memorandum for Record from member that includes:
-        Requested Action; applicant must identify what action they request to be taken
-        Basis for request; it must be clear what they believe to be an injustice or error
-        References or supporting documentation
-      Applicant information to include name, organization/office symbol, unit address, contact
phone number, email address, and signature
Step 3: UFPM route through chain of command to Wing Commander/equivalent
Step 4: After Wing/CC/equivalent decision, UFPM notifies AFPC/DPSI of requested records
change
Step 5: If the member wants to appeal the decision, the UFPM must submit the complete
package to Fitness Assessment Appeals Board (FAAB) at AFPC/DPSIM at
afpcdpffocorgbox@us.af.mil. If needed, the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records
(AFBMCR) will be the final deciding authority.
      10.5.2. Information pertaining to the Wing-level process and procedure and FAAB
      supplemental review can be found at: http://www.afpc.af.mil/affitnessprogram/.
10.6. Correcting administrative errors on FA Scores in AFFMS. Administrative errors are
limited to: Number of repetitions performed does not match number submitted in AFFMS;
corrections to profile dates and exemption updates; deletion of score double entry; and FAs taken
while pregnant. FAC will submit requests for administrative corrections at CONUS locations to
AFPC/SV using the following instructions:            once logged into myPers (https://gum-
crm.csd.disa.mil/app/categories/p/8%2C11/c/1525), highlight the component of the individual
AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013                       53


for which the FA requires correction (Active Duty, Air Force Reserve, or Air National Guard),
run the cursor over the “FSS RESOURCES” link, and then select “SV – Sustainment”. Once
inside the “SV – Sustainment” page, click on the “Submit a case to Sustainment” and complete
the required fields. In cases where a FAC does not exist, the administering PTL, UFPM, or
member may submit the request. Requests for administrative correction must include the
appropriate documentation (i.e., score sheet and/or AF Form 469) for verification purposes.
   10.6.1. Administrative error requests for OCONUS locations will be sent to the respective
   MAJCOM/A1S for action (i.e., PACAF/A1S or USAFE/A1S). In cases where a FAC does
   not exist, the administering PTL, UFPM, or member may submit the request. Requests for
   administrative correction must include the appropriate documentation (i.e., score sheet and/or
   AF Form 469) for verification purposes.

VO2 Max—The maximum volume of oxygen taken in, transported and used by the pulmonary,
cardiovascular, and muscular systems measured in milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body
weight per min (ml/kg/min). VO2 max is the measure of cardiorespiratory endurance or aerobic
fitness and refers to the ability to perform large muscle, dynamic, moderate-to-high intensity
exercise for prolonged periods. It is important to measure cardiorespiratory endurance for:
exercise prescription, progress, feedback, and motivation in an exercise program, as well as
prediction of medical conditions and further diagnoses of health problems.
Wet Bulb Globe Temperature—A composite temperature used to estimate the effect of
temperature, humidity, wind speed and solar radiation on humans. It is used by industrial
hygienists, athletes, and the military to determine appropriate exposure levels to high

                             PHYSICAL FITNESS GUIDANCE

A2.1. Physical Fitness. Physical Fitness is the health and care of the body through physical
activity. The health-related components of fitness are: cardiorespiratory endurance, body
composition, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility-mobility-stability. Each
component is a movement-related trait or capacity that is generally independent of the others.
An underlying concept here is better status in each of the constituent components is associated
with lower risk for development of disease or functional disability. The skill-related components
of fitness are: agility, balance, coordination, power, reaction time, and speed. These components
are more genetically dependent than the health-related components and play a role in some AF
specialties (occupation-specific).
A2.2. Goal. The fundamental goal of a physical fitness program is to bring about a change in
personal health and fitness behavior, which includes, at a minimum, habitual physical activity.
This regular physical activity should result in long-term exercise compliance and attainment of
individual fitness goals and objectives.
A2.3. Objective. The basic objectives of an exercise program are: 1) to gain health benefits
and prevent hypokinetic (inactivity) disorders, or 2) seek to attain greater health benefits and
higher levels of fitness beyond basic health by engaging in physical activity of more vigorous
intensity or of greater volume (longer duration and greater frequency). Daily physical activity is
essential to improve health and quality of life, and maintain functional capacity. Health benefits
are proportional to both the volume and intensity of activity--thus, every increase adds some
benefit. To meet either of the above objectives one must execute a balanced exercise program.
Recommendations from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), the American Heart
Association (AHA), and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are
included in the exercise guidance below.
A2.4. Aerobic Fitness. Synonymous with cardiorespiratory endurance, it is the ability to
perform large muscle, dynamic, moderate-to-high intensity exercise for prolonged periods.
Performance of such exercise depends on the functional state of the respiratory, cardiovascular,
and skeletal muscle systems. More simply defined as the ability to produce energy. Your level
of aerobic fitness determines how long and how hard you can exercise.
   A2.4.1. Mode or Type of Activity. Improvements in aerobic fitness occur when the activity,
   at the proper frequency, duration and intensity, involves a large proportion of total muscle
   mass, maximizes use of large muscles, (e.g., muscles around the thigh and hip), involves
   dynamic, rhythmic muscle contractions, and minimizes static (no movement) contraction and
   use of small muscles. Many modes of activity meet these requirements, to include cross-
   country (Nordic) skng, running, cycling, swimming, skating, rowing, walking, aerobic dance,
   indoor aerobic exercise machines, and some sports if they are continuous in nature (soccer,
   basketball, court sports).
   A2.4.2. Frequency, Duration, and Intensity. Accomplish moderately intense aerobic activity
   30 minutes a day, five days a week or vigorously intense aerobic activity 20 minutes to 25
   minutes a day, 3 days a week and muscle fitness exercise (see below), or an equivalent
   combination of moderately and vigorously intense aerobic activity. For additional and more
   extensive health and fitness benefits, accomplish moderately intense aerobic activity 300
62        AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013


  minutes (5 hours) a week, or accomplish vigorously intense aerobic activity 150 minutes a
  week, or an equivalent combination of moderately and vigorously intense aerobic activity.
  Generally, the minimal levels of exercise volume and intensity above are necessary to
  maintain health and fitness, while the higher levels are necessary to improve health and
  fitness.
  A2.4.3. Intensity Determination. Moderately intense aerobic activity equates to continuous
  exercise that raises heart and respiratory rates, initiates sweating (varies with climate), and
  permits conversation; vigorously intense aerobic activity elicits higher physiological
  responses and permits light or broken conversation.
     A2.4.3.1. Heart Rate (HR) Calculations. Exercise intensity may be measured objectively
     via HR formulas.
         A2.4.3.1.1. Maximal HR Formula. Aerobic activity corresponding to HRs in the
         range of 60% - 90% of age specific estimated maximal HR.
         A2.4.3.1.2. HR Range or HR Reserve Formula – steps are:
             A2.4.3.1.2.1. Calculate Maximal HR. For ages < 40 years subtract age in years
             from 220; max HR = 220 – age. For ages ≥ 40 years multiply age in years by 0.7,
             then subtract product from 208. Max HR = 208 – 0.7age for members age 40
             years and above.
             A2.4.3.1.2.2. Measure Resting HR for three to four days shortly after waking for
             a 60 second period, while in the same body position each day. Take an average of
             the measures.
             A2.4.3.1.2.3. Calculate HR Range. HR Range = Maximal HR – Resting HR.
             A2.4.3.1.2.4. Calculate minimum, optimal (target), and do-not-exceed (safety)
             exercise HRs:
                 A2.4.3.1.2.4.1. Minimum exercise HR = (50% HR Range) + Resting HR.
                 A2.4.3.1.2.4.2. Optimal exercise HR = (75% HR Range) + Resting HR.
                 A2.4.3.1.2.4.3. Do-not-exceed exercise HR = (85% HR Range) + Resting
                 HR.
             A2.4.3.1.2.5. For example, a 30 year old AF member with a Resting HR of 70
             beats/min calculates Maximal HR as 220 – 30 = 190 beats/min and HR Range as
             190 – 70 = 120. Applying the equations:
                 A2.4.3.1.2.5.1. Minimum exercise HR = 50% (120) + 70 = 60 + 70 = 130
                 beats/min
                 A2.4.3.1.2.5.2. Optimal exercise HR = 75% (120) + 70 = 90 + 70 = 160
                 beats/min
                 A2.4.3.1.2.5.3. Do-not-exceed exercise HR = 85% (120) + 70 = 102 + 70 =
                 172 beats/min
                 A2.4.3.1.2.5.4. Therefore, this individual should keep exercise HR above 130
                 beats/min, but below 172 beats/min, targeting 160 beats/min for at least 20
AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013                           63


                  minutes to 25 minutes 3 days/week. Unfit individuals should start at the lower
                  end of the HR Range. As fitness level increases, the resting HR will decrease,
                  therefore increase the intensity percentage from low (50%) towards optimal
                  (75%). Also, base fitness personnel can help fine tune these calculations
                  taking into account medications, risk of injury, and individual preferences and
                  objectives.
   A2.4.4. Rate of Progression. A physiological conditioning or training effect will occur at the
   onset of an exercise program, especially for individuals with low initial fitness levels.
   Adjustments in mode, frequency, duration and intensity may be necessary to reach higher
   levels of health and fitness. Patience and perseverance are critical to maintain an active
   lifestyle and effective exercise program because many will start a physical activity program,
   but within the first two or three weeks of starting, quit and return to an inactive lifestyle. One
   must maintain regular activity for at least three or four weeks before tangible and lasting
   health improvements, including body fat loss, will occur. To help ensure that increases in
   frequency, duration, and especially intensity of activity occur in a gradual fashion, the
   following stages of progression are helpful to avoid injury, illness, and potential
   discouragement.
       A2.4.4.1. Initial Stage. Include low-level aerobic activities and light muscular endurance
       exercises for minimal muscle soreness or discomfort. Do not be aggressive in this stage.
       Set individual goals which are achievable and realistic; include a system of personal
       rewards. Majority of failures occur in this stage – persevere to experience benefits.
       A2.4.4.2. Improvement Stage. Progress more rapidly here at a higher intensity, steadily
       increase duration to 45 minutes of continuous exercise. Increase frequency as adaptation
       to exercise permits.
       A2.4.4.3. Maintenance Stage.      After six months of regular activity, focus on
       maintenance. Review goals ensuring that long-term focus is on a lifestyle approach to
       activity, remembering that considerable health benefits come from regular participation
       in moderate exercise.

A2.5. Muscular Fitness. A linked term for muscular strength, the maximum force generated by
a specific muscle or muscle group, and muscular endurance, the ability of a muscle group to
execute repeated contractions over a period of sufficient time duration to cause muscular fatigue.
A balanced physical activity program should address the five health-related components of
physical fitness, with primary emphasis on aerobic fitness, but muscular fitness is also important
as inclusion of muscular fitness exercise, and provides several benefits (See Table A2.5).

Table A2.2. Benefits of Muscular Fitness Exercise – General Guidance.
  1. Develops muscular strength and endurance to enhance the ability to live a physically
      independent lifestyle, i.e., improves daily functional living
  2. Increases and maintains fat-free (lean) mass, helping to maintain resting metabolic rate,
      which is beneficial for preventing fat gain
  3. Increases the strength and integrity of connective tissue
  4. Increases bone mineral density, preventing age-related bone deterioration
  5. Combats chronic low back problems
  6. Improves the ability of the muscles to recover from physical activity
  7. Provides injury protection during deployment, daily work, and sports and recreational
      activities
  8. Alleviates some common musculoskeletal complaints which result in lost duty time and
      medical treatment costs
  9. May provide modest gains in cardiorespiratory fitness
  10. May improve mood and self-image
   A2.5.1. Overload, Mode, and Pattern. Development of muscular strength and muscular
   endurance occurs by placing an overload on a muscle or muscle groups. Through adaptation
   the muscles become stronger or better able to sustain muscular activity. This process of
   overloading the muscular system is referred to as resistance training which includes, but is
   not limited to calisthenics, weight training, and field exercises. This training should focus
   not only on the core, lower and upper regions of the body, but also on primary movement
   patterns (in priority order) of run, bend, twist, squat, pull, push. Resistance training should
   also be individualized, i.e., specifically designed to meet one’s needs, and progressive in
   nature by including periodic increases in workload as muscular fitness improves;
   physiological adaptations to properly executed resistance training include both
   neuromuscular adaptations (occurs in the first several weeks of a muscle fitness program)
   and muscle cell adaptations (occurs later).
   A2.5.2. Volume and Intensity. ACSM, AHA, and CDC recommend accomplishing 8 to 10
   resistance training exercises involving all major muscle groups, at least twice per week.
   They recommend one set of 8 to 12 repetitions of each exercise performed at moderate or
   high intensity to muscular fatigue. Multiple-set regimens may provide greater benefits as
   time permits.
   A2.5.3. Procedures and Safety. The following resistance training procedures work in
   conjunction with the above recommendations for general fitness:
       A2.5.3.1. Control - Training activities should be rhythmic, performed at a controlled
       speed, and not interfere with normal breathing.
AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013                          65


       A2.5.3.2. Order of Execution – Do not work the same muscle group with consecutive
       exercises. Rather, work the major areas of the body at one time, i.e., core, lower, then
       upper, etc., with occasional mixing of exercises within major areas to maintain variety
       and prevent staleness in the workout routine. Also, start with exercises of greatest
       priority and follow with exercises of lesser importance.
       A2.5.3.3. Range of Motion (ROM) – Conduct exercises over the joint’s full ROM in a
       controlled manner, however, limit the ROM on leg extensions (approximately 20 degrees
       to approximately 60 degrees of motion) to protect the knee joint.
       A2.5.3.4. Rest Time - Keep rest time between exercises (and between sets if use multiple
       sets) as brief as possible, approximately one-to-one or one-to-two work: rest ratio for
       strength, shorter rest for endurance, and longer rest and higher resistance for power.
       Avoid long, time wasting breaks which results in better fitness, a more efficient workout,
       and increases the likelihood for retaining resistance training as a lifestyle behavior.
       A2.5.3.5. Safety - Perform a proper warm-up, work antagonistic (opposite) muscle
       groups, and use a spotter if using free weights.
   A2.5.4. Calisthenics Specific Training. Calisthenics are body resistance exercises to
   improve muscular fitness, e.g., sit-ups, push-ups, and pull-ups. One of several means of
   physical training with these and other calisthenics exercises is a basic set procedure that
   provides a fairly objective means for controlling an individual exercise prescription. The
   goal of this procedure is to accomplish 33% of a one test (one set) maximum in a three set
   pattern on a controlled one minute cycle. First, determine the current maximum number of
   repetitions of the exercise in a one minute period (i.e., use the most current AF Fitness
   Assessment result). Secondly, take 33% of that total number for the amount of repetitions to
   perform for each of the three sets. Rest between sets is on the minute cycle, i.e., perform the
   first set of repetitions, rest for the remainder of one minute, then start the next set at the 60
   second cumulative time mark, and start the third set at the cumulative 120 second mark.
   Perform the three sets of exercise once per day starting at two to three days per week
   building to a maximum of six days per week. For example, an individual with a sit-up test
   maximum of 44 repetitions will perform three sets of 15 repetitions per set on the minute
   cycle: 15 repetitions – rest remainder of the first minute, 15 repetitions – rest remainder of
   second minute, 15 repetitions. Over time add repetitions to each set as the last few
   repetitions of the third set become easier.
A2.6. Flexibility. The maximum ability to move a joint freely, without pain, through a range of
motion. Flexibility tends to decrease with age, primarily due to the decrease in activity
associated with age. Although flexibility is not assessed during the AF Fitness Assessment, no
single test can be generalized to evaluate total body flexibility, it is important to health and
functional living and should be part of a well-balanced physical activity routine.
   A2.6.1. Timing and Guidance. Despite the popular perception that stretching prior to
   exercise enhances performance and prevents injury, little scientific evidence exists to support
   such long-held beliefs. Rather, engage in a gradual, activity-specific warm-up that includes
   the movement patterns of planned activity, e.g., if running for the workout then warm-up
   with brisk walking, jogging, and dynamic movements or drills such as leg swings and knee
   raises. To help maintain flexibility one should stretch after a workout when muscles,
 66          AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013


   tendons, ligaments and connective tissue are warmer (above normal body temperature).
   Static stretch according to the following ACSM guidance:
         A2.6.1.1. Type: static stretch, with a major emphasis on the major muscle groups to
         include the low back, hips, quadriceps and hamstrings (front and back of thigh), lower
         leg. Do not ballistic (bounce) stretch.
         A2.6.1.2. Frequency: two to three days per week
         A2.6.1.3. Duration: 10 to 30 seconds for each stretch
         A2.6.1.4. Intensity: to a position of mild discomfort, not to point of pain
         A2.6.1.5. Repetitions: three to four for each stretch (NOTE: First increase body
         temperature, do not “cold” stretch. Finally, avoid comparing one’s level of flexibility to
         others as it varies widely across individuals due to several factors that include gender,
         age, activity level, temperature, and extensibility of the muscles and tendons surrounding
         the joints)
   A2.6.2. Warm-up and Cool-down. Although frequently ignored, these activities before and
   after an exercise session are important. Warm-up should be conducted as above (activity
   specific movements and dynamic drills) and always precede physical activity to increase
   body temperature and blood flow and to guard against muscle, tendon and ligament strains
   and tears. Cool-down, as important as the warm-up, is a gradual reduction in activity to
   prevent blood pooling, hasten recovery and avoid injury.
   A2.6.3. Stability and Mobility. These are terms recently combined with flexibility in this
   final health-related component to designate a broader term that encompasses the role of
   stability and mobility in posture, occupational functional movement, and daily functional
   living. Stability deals with maintaining non-movement functional positions, including
   postural stability. Stability ranges from shoulder to ankle with shoulder, core and hip
   stability as primary. Mobility, similar to stability, is stable, controlled, functional movement
   through an active range of motion in the various planes of motion.
A2.7. General Workout Session. The salient phases of a recommended general workout
session address the above components in the following order:
   A2.7.1. Movement Preparatory Phase (Warm-Up). Body temperature increases via activity
   specific warm-up such as dynamic activity drills.
   A2.7.2. Cardiorespiratory Endurance (Aerobic) Phase. Aerobic activity such as cross-
   country skng, running, cycling, swimming, skating, rowing, walking, aerobic dance, indoor
   aerobic exercise machines (e.g., cycle ergometer, elliptical, rower, versa climber, stair), and
   some sports if they are continuous in nature.
   A2.7.3. Muscle Fitness Phase. Resistance training such as calisthenics, weight/object
   training (e.g., machines, free weights, medicine balls, kettle bells, bands, cables, ropes),
   plyometrics, and field exercises. Movement Patterns – run, bend, twist, squat, pull, push.
   Body Regions – core, lower, whole body, upper. Stability and Mobility/Functional
   Movement.
      A2.7.4. Combined Activity Phase. Combined aerobic and muscular fitness actions, e.g.,
      rotations, or running between muscle fitness stations.
AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013                           67


   A2.7.5. Skill Phase. Occupational or sport specific skill development/practice as desired.
   A2.7.6. Movement Transition/Cessation Phase (Cool-Down). Activity specific cool-down.
   Flexibility - static stretching.
A2.8. Body Composition. Relative portion of the body comprised of fat and fat-free tissue.
Body weight and body fat are related to health status, but misconceptions exist regarding body
measurements and application of results. In the prevention of fat gain and associated diseases
the focus must go beyond body weight measures to relative body fat, and body fat distribution.
   A2.8.1. Weight and Height. Measurements of weight and weight relative to height (scale
   readings, height-weight tables, BMI) do not differentiate between fat and fat-free tissue, and
   do not account for fat distribution pattern.
   A2.8.2. Relative Body Fat and Body Fat Distribution. The amount of total body tissue that
   is fat and where fat is deposited or carried on the body is necessary to complete a body
   composition assessment. This is done via “non-scale” measurements.
       A2.8.2.1. Percent Body Fat. Total body fat relative to body mass is known as percent
       body fat. Average and at risk levels are 15% and 25% for males, 23% and 32% for
       females, respectively.
       A2.8.2.2. Abdominal Circumference. Increased health risks associated with overfat are
       not only related to total body fat, but also and more closely to fat distribution. Upper
       body or trunk fat, specifically abdominal fat, presents the greatest health risk; it is highly
       linked to cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders such as type diabetes.
       Reducing abdominal girth or circumference is more important than normalizing body
       weight since exercise induced increases in muscle mass can mask reductions in girth, i.e.,
       with proper exercise body weight may stay the same or even increase, but “belt size” will
       reduce. Therefore, as abdominal fat is an independent risk factor for disease, the
       evaluation of AC is used. A high risk of current and future disease exists for males with
       an AC > 39 inches and for females with an AC > 35.5 inches regardless of age or height.
       The health risk is moderate for males with an AC > 35 inches and for females with an AC
       > 31.5 inches.
NOTE: The above guidance are recommendations for a member to increase or maintain fitness.
EP/FPMs will determine whether adjustments in mode, intensity, duration, frequency or
repetitions are required based on the member’s exercise regimen, characteristics, and FA scores
to improve fitness. Members who are over age 35 years and are sedentary and members who are
initiating a fitness program should contact their fitness center or Health Promotion staff/HAWC
for assistance in developing an exercise routine. Members who are over age 35 years and are
sedentary should also consider contacting their medical care provider prior to initiating physical
activity. ARC members can consult Health Promotion staff/HAWCs and fitness center trainers
where available. Members are highly encouraged to seek professional advice from personal
fitness trainers, FCs, or Health Promotion staff/HAWCs for assistance in establishing or
adjusting their personal fitness program.

                     SAMPLE UNIT PHYSICAL FITNESS PROGRAMS

A3.1. Ability-based training/fitness screening.
      A3.1.1. Commanders will use trained PTL-As to establish unit programs that allow members
      to participate at their current fitness level and progress gradually. A safe conditioning
      program encourages and supports members training at their own pace.
         A3.1.1.1. PTL-As consult the EP/FPM to assist with development of ability-based
         training programs.
   A3.1.2. Commanders opting to implement maximal exertion activities (e.g. practice timed
   assessments), should require personnel to complete a FSQ (Attachment 4).
A3.2. Considerations to be made prior to beginning the unit physical fitness event:
   A3.2.1. Safety/environmental conditions.
   A3.2.2. Acclimatization: individuals who have recently PCS’d may require a 6-week period
   of acclimatization to local environmental conditions.
   A3.2.3. Fluids/hydration: must be available during the exercise event/activity.
   A3.2.4. Emergencies/injuries: establish emergency procedures to include availability of a
   cell phone, emergency responder contact information, BLS-trained members, and first aid
   kit.
   A3.2.5. Safety: reflective vests, appointment of safety monitors/cross guards, and
   cones/signs on course as appropriate.
   A3.2.6. Unit Physical Fitness Programs must follow guidance as specified in Attachment 2.
         A3.2.6.1. Individual abilities should be considered so that all members are provided a
         workout that is within their current fitness status.
   A3.2.7. Warm-up and cool-down periods should be accomplished with each unit physical
   fitness event.
A3.3. PTL-developed, ability-based Unit Physical Training Programs.
   A3.3.1. Ability runs. Prior to the unit exercise session, divide the unit into groups based
   upon the members’ running paces.
         A3.3.1.1. A leader capable of maintaining the assigned pace for the group should be
         assigned to each group to monitor for safety/injuries of group members.
         A3.3.1.2. For safety purposes, prior to the exercise session, determine the
         distance/course to be covered and/or the time in which to run and mark the course to alert
         others of group PT.
         A3.3.1.3. As a variation, the unit may run together for a specified short duration (at a
         pace that can be achieved by all participants) and then divide into the assigned ability
         groups for the remainder of the event.
AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013                     69


       A3.3.1.4. As members’ fitness levels increase, they should be placed in faster running
       groups.
       A3.3.1.5. Discourage formation running and cadence calls while running. Doing so may
       place member at risk for injury for the shortest and tallest individuals since cadence
       calling forces all to move at the speed and stride length of the caller. Running is more
       efficient when each member can run at his/her own stride frequency and stride length. If
       desired, cadence calls should be used for short-distance foot marches only.
   A3.3.2. Multi-station training courses (e.g., obstacle courses, par courses, and circuit
   training).
       A3.3.2.1. Prior to using course, discuss safety and fitness concepts of course with the
       EP/FPM.
       A3.3.2.2. Consider individual abilities by permitting members to progress through
       course at their own speed. Those members who complete course in faster times should
       be encouraged to complete additional components of course a second time until all
       members are through the course at least once.
       A3.3.2.3. Multi-station training can be accomplished at base fitness facilities using
       exercise/fitness equipment or at a designated outdoor area performing activities of both
       cardiovascular and muscular fitness.
          A3.3.2.3.1. Coordinate with fitness facilities in order to conduct multi-station
          training sessions at times conducive to unit, as well as, fitness facility.
          A3.3.2.3.2. Coordinate with EP/FPM to obtain multi-station training programs
          appropriate to the fitness site.
   A3.3.3. Fitness facilities/existing fitness programs/classes.
       A3.3.3.1. Coordinate with fitness facilities for group PT exercise sessions and fitness
       classes.
       A3.3.3.2. Individual members should complete continuous aerobic exercise of their
       choice (e.g., treadmill, rower, stair-climber, cross trainers, bicycles, swimming and
       spinning classes). Recommend 25-45 minutes in duration.
A3.4. Prevention of Injury and Illness.
   A3.4.1. Safety must be an overarching concern throughout all physical training. Consider
   individual safety issues such as medical or physical limitations and level of ability.
   A3.4.2. Ensure a safe environment for training IAW local guidance (e.g., assessing traffic
   patterns, use of headphones or other personal equipment, temperature, availability of
   water/first aid, and awareness of emergency procedures).
       A3.4.2.1. Physical conditioning conducted in PT uniform (shorts and t-shirt) may be
       performed continuously up to 1 hour in all but “black flag” heat condition (90 degrees
       Fahrenheit and above). Recommend limiting fitness activities during “black flag” heat
       conditions to indoor activities.
   A3.4.3. For cold weather limitations consult tables A.4.1 and A4.2 in AFPAM 48-151,
   Thermal Injury.

                    FITNESS ASSESSMENT VERBAL INSTRUCTIONS

A5.1. Verbal Air Force Fitness Assessment Instructions. Test Administrator will read/state:
You are about to complete the Air Force Fitness Assessment. You are presumed fit to participate
based on your completion of the FSQ. You may re-accomplish the FSQ if medical concerns
have developed since completion, but must do so prior to beginning the FA. If you experience
injury or illness during the FA, you will have the option of being evaluated at the MTF, but your
test may still count. If the medical evaluation validates your illness/injury your Commander may
invalidate the test results. If the test is invalidated, you will be required to retest within 5 days.
At no time will a back-dated AF 469 (fitness exemption) be accepted. Each component requires
minimum performance. If for any reason you do not meet the minimum requirements you are
expected to complete the remaining components. Scores for all components are final.
A5.2. Verbal Body Composition Instructions. The Test Administrator must read the
following instructions to all Airmen and demonstrate the proper technique, or show the Air Force
instructional video. If the instructional video is shown, instructions reading and demonstration is
not required.
   A5.2.1. The abdominal circumference is the assessment for body composition. Please stand
   facing forward with your arms to your side similar to attention position. I will take the
   measurement from your right hand side on bare skin only. Before the measurement you will
   adjust your clothing so it does not fall over your waist during the measurement. I will set the
   end of the tape directly above your hip-bone (iliac crest) and ask you to hold it in place. I
   will walk around you to confirm parallel placement of the tape and then I will kneel down to
   measure the AC at the end of your normal breath exhalation. Make sure you do not hold
   your breath.
   A5.2.2. I will take your measurement 3 times. If there is more than 1 inch difference I will
   take a 4th measurement. I will average the closest 3 measurements and round the result
   down to the nearest ½ inch and that will be your recorded score.
A5.3. Push-Up Verbal Instructions. The Test Administrator must read the following
instructions to all Airmen and demonstrate the proper technique, or show the Air Force
instructional video. If the instructional video is shown, instructions reading and demonstration is
not required.
   A5.3.1. The push-up is one assessment of muscular fitness. Place your palms or fists on the
   floor, hands will be slightly wider than shoulder width apart with your elbows fully extended.
   Your feet may be no more than 12 inches apart and should not be supported, braced or
   crossed. Your body should maintain a rigid head to heel form. This is the up/starting
   position.
   A5.3.2. Begin by lowering your body to the ground until your upper arms are at least parallel
   to the floor (elbows bent at 90 degrees) then return to the up position (arms fully extended
   but not locked). This is one repetition.
   A5.3.3. Your chest may touch, but not rest or bounce on the floor. If you do not come down
   parallel to the floor, the push-up will not count. Resting can only be done in the up position.
   You may remove your hands or feet from the floor or bridge or bow your back, but only in
 76        AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013


   the up/rest position, resting any other body part on the floor is not allowed. If resting occurs
   in the down position, the push-up portion of test will be terminated and your score will be
   based on the correct number of push-ups performed up to that point.
   A5.3.4. Your breathing should be as normal as possible. Make sure you do not hold your
   breath. You have one minute to perform as many correct push-ups as you are able. Your
   counter will count the correct number of push-ups aloud. Your counter will not count
   incorrect push-ups. Your counter will tell you what you are doing wrong and will repeat the
   last number of correct push-ups until you correct the error. The total number of correct push-
   ups in one minute is recorded as your score.
A5.4. Sit-up Verbal Instructions. The Test Administrator must read the following instructions
to all Airmen and demonstrate the proper technique, or show the Air Force instructional video.
If the instructional video is shown, instructions reading and demonstration is not required.
   A5.4.1. Begin by laying face up on the floor or mat. Your feet may extend off the floor or
   mat, but your buttocks, shoulders, and head must not extend beyond the mat. Bend your
   knees at 90 degrees, with your feet or heels in contact with the floor at all times. Cross your
   arms over your chest with your open hands or fingers at your shoulders or resting on your
   upper chest. This is the starting position. When conducting sit-ups, any part of the
   hands/fingers remain in contact with the shoulders or upper chest at all times.
   A5.4.2. If a bolted non-portable toe hold bar is used: Anchor your feet to the ground by
   hooking your feet/toes under the bar. Your heels must remain in contact with the ground at
   all times and the bar cannot move while you perform the assessment. If a toe hold bar is
   NOT used: Members may request the assessor to hold feet with his/her hands or by putting
   his/her knees on the feet. The assessor may not anchor member by holding behind the calves
   or by standing on the feet during the assessment as he/she could lose balance and step off.
   The member may request a member of the same gender to hold the feet and that request must
   be granted. Let your monitor know if you need your feet held differently prior to beginning
   the assessment. (e.g., "You are holding my ankles/feet too tight or not enough.”).
   A5.4.3. From the starting position, raise your upper torso until your elbows touch your knees
   or thighs. Then, lower your upper torso until your shoulder blades contact the floor. This is
   one repetition. Your elbows must touch your knees or thighs at the top of the sit-up, and
   your shoulder blades must contact the floor or mat at the bottom of the sit-up (keeping any
   part of your hands/fingers in contact with your shoulder/upper chest at all times).
   A5.4.4. The repetition will not count if your hands/fingers come completely away from the
   chest/shoulder or if your buttocks or heels leave the ground. Additionally, you may not grab
   onto your shirt as it makes it difficult to determine if you are maintaining proper contact.
   Any resting must be done in the up position. While resting you may not use knees or any
   object to support yourself. If there is any resting other than in the up position, the sit-up
   portion of the test is terminated and your score will be based on the correct number of sit-ups
   performed up to that point.
   A5.4.5. You have one minute to perform as many correct sit-ups as you are able. Your
   counter will count the correct number of sit-ups aloud. Your counter will not count incorrect
   sit-ups. Your counter will tell you what you are doing wrong and will repeat the last number
AFI36-2905 21 OCTOBER 2013Corrective Actions applied on 29 October 2013                         77


   of correct sit-ups until you correct the error. The total number of correct sit-ups in one
   minute is recorded as your score.
A5.5. 1.5 mile timed run Verbal Instructions: The Test Administrator must read the
following instructions to all Airmen and demonstrate the proper technique, or show the Air Force
instructional video. If the instructional video is shown, instructions reading and demonstration is
not required.
   A5.5.1. This 1.5 mile timed run is used to measure cardio-respiratory fitness. Prior to
   beginning the 1.5 mile run, you may complete up to a 3 minute warm up. You will line up
   behind the starting line and will be instructed to begin running as I start the stopwatch. No
   physical assistance from anyone or anything is permitted. Pacing is permitted if there is no
   physical contact and is not a hindrance to other runners. You are required to stay on and
   complete the entire marked course. Leaving the course is disqualifying and terminates the
   test. Your completion time will be recorded when you cross the finish line and you are
   required to complete a cool down for approximately 5 minutes. If at any time you are feeling
   in poor health, you are to stop running immediately and you will be given assistance.
A5.6. 2.0 kilometer walk Verbal Instructions: The Test Administrator must read the
following instructions to all Airmen and demonstrate the proper technique, or show the Air Force
instructional video. If the instructional video is shown, instructions reading and demonstration is
not required.
   A5.6.1. The Test Administrator must read the following instructions to all Airmen and
   demonstrate the proper technique, or show the Air Force instructional video. If the
   instructional video is shown, instructions reading and demonstration is not required. This
   test measures cardio-respiratory fitness. Prior to beginning the 2.0 km walk, you may
   complete up to a 3 minute warm up. You will be directed to line up behind the starting line
   and instructed to begin walking as I start the stopwatch. You are to walk the 2.0 km course
   as quickly as you can. You must not run, keeping at least one foot in contact with the ground
   at all times. No physical assistance from anyone or anything is permitted. Pacing is
   permitted if there is no physical contact and is not a hindrance to others. You are required to
   stay on and complete the entire marked course. Leaving the course is disqualifying and
   terminates the test. Your completion time will be recorded when you cross the finish line
   and you are required to complete a cool down for approximately 5 minutes. If at any time
   you are feeling in poor health, you are to stop immediately and you will be given assistance.

      MEDICATIONS AFFECTING AF FITNESS PROGRAM PARTICIPATION

A9.1. This attachment lists medications that may preclude aerobic components in the
FA. Before considering medications for a medical exemption, the underlying condition should
be addressed as a potential reason for exemption. Chronic conditions that result in medical
exemption from any aerobic components should be reviewed for possible MEB IAW AFI 48-123
and AFI 10-203.
A9.2. Any medication that affects the heart rate or the heart’s response to exercise may
invalidate aerobic components of the FA. Chronic medications should not be discontinued
simply to allow the fitness assessment if this would adversely impact the member’s health or
safety. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications or “supplements” of any kind should not be a cause
for exemption unless the OTC medications/supplements are specifically recommended by a
provider and this recommendation is documented in the medical record. Members using acute,
short-term medications that result in component exemptions should be given a temporary
duty/fitness restriction until the medication is no longer needed.
A9.3. Table A9.1 is not an all-inclusive list of all medications that could potentially affect
FA participation. Furthermore, individual patient situations may require exemptions beyond
what is detailed here. The member’s provider shall not be constrained by this Table in making
fitness participation restriction recommendations. The MTF provider will review the medical
documentation and provider restriction recommendations when making fitness testing exemption
recommendations.

                      2.0-KILOMETER TIMED WALK INSTRUCTIONS

A11.1. Criteria. The following criteria must be considered prior to the 2.0-kilometer timed
walk assessment.
      A11.1.1. Members completing the assessment must wear the Air Force physical training
      uniform.
      A11.1.2. Members must warm-up prior to beginning the assessment.
      A11.1.3. Members must complete the FSQ.

      A6.2).
A11.2. Requirements.
      A11.2.1. A measured 2.0-kilometer, uninterrupted course approved by the Wing CC. The
      course will meet requirements of paragraph A6.1., with the exception of the number of laps.
      A11.2.2. Sufficient trained personnel must be present to be able to monitor members at all
      times, to record laps if necessary, and to record walk completion times.
      A11.2.3. Additional equipment requirements include timers, notepads, scorecards, and
      pens/pencils.
A11.3. Administering the 2.0-kilometer walk assessment.
      A11.3.1. Airmen performing the 2.0-kilometer (2,000 meters) walk are required to walk as
      quickly as possible. Airmen must walk but not run, keeping at least one foot in contact with
      the ground at all times.
A11.4. Scoring results of the 2.0-kilometer walk assessment.

This table is only illustrative and is not binding. Unit CCs exercise complete discretion in
selecting responsive action(s). Commanders may use more than one action per failure.
Recommend commanders consult with their local Staff Judge Advocate (SJA). Refer to the
governing instructions to determine the correct form and procedures for each action.
NOTEs:
    1. Commanders may render an individual ineligible for reenlistment rather than denying

     reenlistment by specifying ineligibility versus non-selection on the AF Form 418,
     Selective Reenlistment Program Consideration. This allows the flexibility of authorizing
     an individual to extend their reenlistment for either 4 or 7 months (7 or 12 for ARC) to
     improve their fitness level. Individuals non-selected for reenlistment are not allowed to
     extend for any reason and will separate on the date of separation (DOS). Commanders
     may complete a second AF Form 418 changing the member’s ineligibility or non-
     selection status at any time.
  2. For ARC, the use of this option should be weighed against use of administrative
     separation and is applicable where recall of this member would not jeopardize mission
     readiness.

                  BODY FAT ASSESSMENT (BFA) INSTRUCTIONS

Table A19.1. Instructions (Male).
 NECK:                       With the member looking straight ahead and shoulders
                             down (not hunched), measure the neck circumference at a point
                             just below the larynx (Adams Apple). Because of the shape of
                             the neck, the tape will usually be angled down slightly toward
                             the front similar to the shirt collar line. This angle will vary
                             depending on where the larynx is located. Round the neck
                             measurement up to the nearest quarter inch.
 ABDOMEN:                    With the member standing with arms at his sides and at the end of
                             a normal relaxed exhalation, measure the abdominal
                             circumference at the navel while keeping the tape level
                             (horizontal) to the floor. Ensure the tape measure is
                             horizontal all the way around the abdomen. Round the
                             abdomen measurement down to the nearest quarter inch.
 BODY FAT                    Determine the individual’s body fat percentage by: Subtracting
 PERCENTAGE                  the neck measurement from the abdominal measurement to
 DETERMINATION:              determine the circumference value. Use the Body Fat Percent
                             Tables for Men at Attachment 20 and compare this value to
                             the individual’s height measurement.

Table A19.2. Instructions (Female).
 NECK:             With the member looking straight ahead and shoulders down (not
                   hunched), measure the neck circumference at a point just below the larynx.
                   Because of the shape of the neck, the tape will usually be angled down
                   slightly toward the front similar to the shirt collar line. This a n g l e will
                   vary depending on where the larynx is located. Round the neck
                   measurement up to the nearest quarter inch.
 WAIST:            With the member standing with arms at her sides and at the end of a
                   normal relaxed exhalation, measure the natural waist circumference.
                   The natural waist circumference is the narrowest point, usually located
                   about half way between the navel and the lower end of the sternum
                   (breastbone). Ensure the tape measure is horizontal all the way
                   around the waist. When it is not easy to distinguish the narrowest
                   point, take several measurements and use the smallest measurement.
                   Round the waist measurement down to the nearest quarter inch.

 BUTTOCKS:        While facing the member’s right side, and with the tape measure level
                  (horizontal) to the floor, measure the buttocks circumference by placing
                  the tape (ensure the tape measure is horizontal all the way around) so it
                  passes over the buttocks at the point that protrudes the farthest.
                  EXCEPTION: Ensure no part of the leg or thigh is a part of the
                  measurement. If so, raise the tape measure up (still keeping it horizontal) to
                  the point in which no part of the leg or thigh is a part of the measurement.
                  Round the buttock measurement down to the nearest quarter inch.

BODY FAT          Determine the individual’s body fat percentage by: Adding the waist and
PERCENTAGE        buttocks measurements then subtracting the neck measurement from the
DETERMINA-        sum to determine the circumference value. Use the Body Fat Percent
