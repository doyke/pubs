        2.1.4.1. Outlets located in the industrial areas of the base (all office, shop and flight line areas)
        will only be used when the outside temperature is 10°F or below. The use of these outlets will
        be restricted to 2 hours prior to vehicle start up. These outlets are to be used by government
        owned vehicles (GOVs) only.
        2.1.4.2. Outlets located in the community area of the base (dormitories, visiting officer quar-

        of any new contractor plantings. Facility managers or other facility users will do general irri-
        gation around their buildings. Building managers may hand water new "Self Help" plantings,
        if required to allow them to become established. Hand watering shall not be done to the point
        of runoff and is encouraged to be accomplished in early morning or late afternoon to minimize
        evaporation.

         2.2.4.3. The 319 MSG/CC may occasionally limit or curtail irrigation and vehicle washing in
         MFH, due to drought or water system problems. In such a case, notices will be published in
         base announcements and posted on the base cable channel. It is the responsibility of MFH res-
         idents to keep abreast of and comply with all published water use policies.
         2.2.4.4. MFH occupants shall identify any leaking government-owned equipment to housing
         maintenance for repair as soon as possible. Personally owned equipment that is leaking shall
