The bearer is aware the RAB is the property of the United States Government. Counterfeiting,
alteration or misuse is a violation of 18 U.S.C. 499, 506, and 701, and will make offender liable
to a heavy penalty.

5. It has been determined by the named investigating official that the loss of this badge does (or
does not) compromise the 910 Airlift Wing Security Program and does (or does not) indicate an
abuse by the bearer of the RAB system. NOTE: If determination is made that the badge holder is
at fault, a brief statement of circumstances is placed here.

6. (Rank + Full Name) does require unescorted entry privileges to the restricted area based on his
job/mission requirements. I do request a new Restricted Area Badge be reissued.
