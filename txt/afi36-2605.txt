                                       Guidance Changes

1. FLPB Certification and Payment. Airmen will be authorized for FLPB payment in
accordance with Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 7280.03, Foreign Language
Proficiency Bonus (FLPB).

1.1. Proficiency. To be considered proficient for the purposes of FLPB, an Airman must
demonstrate appropriate Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) proficiency in any two of the
three modalities of listening, reading, or speaking on any range, Very Low Range (VLR), Lower
Range (LR), Upper Range (UR) (as stated in 1.3.2 below, for UR), of the Defense Language
Proficiency Test (DLPT), Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI) or other DLI-certified and DoD
approved test in a foreign language or dialect (subsequently referred to as language) listed on the
current AF Strategic Language List (SLL).

1.2. Certification Period. The certification date for FLPB is the date of the most recently tested
qualifying modality. A commander cannot deny an Airman from taking a DLPT System test in
order to qualify for FLPB.

1.2.1. FLPB certifications expire one year from the first day of the first month after the final
certification month. Example: If an Airman certifies on 15 August 2011, the certification will
expire on 1 September 2012.

1.2.2. Airmen who are unable to re-certify within 12 months of certification due to deployment,
ad-hoc operations or duty assignment where web-delivered testing facilities are not
available/accessible, will maintain their previous qualifying scores and certification for up to 180
days after returning to home station or arriving at a follow-on assignment.

1.3. Testing. Qualifying scores are the two highest scores in any combination of two of the
three modalities (listening/reading/speaking) within a single range of DLPT (VLR, LR, UR), (for
specific guidelines on UR certification, see 1.3.2) or OPI tests taken within a 30-calendar-day
period. The OPI can be matched with any range of DLPT for FLPB certification. For those
languages which only have a single-modality OPI, that OPI score may be recorded as both
listening and speaking to meet the two modality requirement for FLPB.

1.3.1. Dialect listening tests that pair with a base language reading test in order to meet the two
modality requirement for FLPB are not required to be taken within 30 calendar days of the
reading modality. Airmen should contact their Test Control Officer (TCO) with questions about
which dialect listening tests pair with a base language reading test. Example: An Airman takes
the Listening and Reading modalities of the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) DLPT on 2 January
2012 and achieves a 3/3, qualifying the Airman to receive FLPB for MSA. The Airman
subsequently takes the Listening modality of the Arabic-Levantine DLPT on 15 June 2012 and
achieves a 3. The Airman is able to pair his Arabic-Levantine listening modality with the MSA
Reading modality to receive FLPB for Arabic-Levantine at 3/3, beginning on 15 June 2012. The
Airman’s certification date for MSA expires 1 Feb 2013, but the member will remain eligible for
Arabic-Levantine until 1 July 2013.

                                                                                                   2
1.3.1.1. The one-year certification period for the dialect will be from the date of the dialect
listening test (assuming the member has a current base language reading test) and will not
change until the member next takes the dialect listening test or until the certification expires,
regardless of any change in the base language reading score. An OPI score may be substituted
for the dialect listening score to meet the two-modality requirement for FLPB.

1.3.2. The Upper Range (UR) DLPT may be used for certification above ILR level 3 (i.e. 3+ or
4). Airmen may take the UR test in any modality on which they scored a 3 on the LR DLPT or
3+ or higher on the UR DLPT for the specified language. The initial UR test may be taken
immediately after the score for the LR test has been posted to the DLPT Authorization and
Reporting system, but must be completed within 90 days of the date of the LR test to be valid for
certification purposes. Once the initial portion of the UR test has been taken, all portions must
be completed within 30 calendar days to be valid for certification. If a member achieves a score
above ILR level 3 on the UR test, the certification date will become the date the UR test was
completed. If the member scores a level 3 in listening or reading on the UR test, the date of
certification will remain the date the LR test was completed and the member must take the LR
DLPT for their next certification.

1.3.3. No more than two iterations of the same range of DLPT will be administered to the same
person in the same language in a 12-month period. TCOs will schedule and conduct annual
DLPT System Tests no earlier than 180 calendar days from the last administration of a test in
that modality and language for a given individual or upon completion of a significant language
training event in that language, without prior approval from AFPC/DSYX.

1.3.4. TCOs will validate all qualifying scores and appropriate Career Field Managers (CFMs)
will validate appropriate Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs).

1.3.5. When a DLPT has only one modality the TCO will determine whether an OPI is available
and inform the member testing in order for the member to meet the two-modality requirement.

1.4. Payment. In accordance with DoDI 7280.03, FLPB payments are authorized as follows:

1.4.1. Payments may be made in monthly installments or a lump sum, but will not exceed
$12,000 over a single year of certification.

1.4.2. When more than one language is authorized for FLPB, total payments shall not exceed
$500 per month for any single language, or $1,000 per month for any combination of languages.

1.4.3. Languages designated Prevalent in the Force (PIF) on the current AF SLL are not
authorized for FLPB except as outlined below in section 2, FLPB Eligibility. PIF languages are
those identified on the AF SLL as having sufficient capacity to meet documented AF
requirements.

1.4.4. Airmen proficient in language(s) outside of what is required in their current billets and/or
their Control Language(s) (CLANG(s)) may receive FLPB for those additional language(s) IAW
2.12, All Others. CLANG is defined in section 2 below, for each language community.


                                                                                                    3
1.4.5. Payments are authorized according to the rules outlined in Table 1: AF FLPB Payment
Rate Categories, and sections 2 and 3 below.

2. FLPB Eligibility. FLPB eligibility is based upon awarded AFSC, current duty assignment,
participation in specific programs (e.g. Language Enabled Airman Program, International
Professional Military Education, Olmsted Scholar, etc.) and/or the language’s designation on the
AF SLL. The following paragraphs provide specific information for individual eligibility and
administrative procedures to qualify for and receive FLPB. Airmen are instructed to find the
category below that applies to their current duty assignments to determine FLPB eligibility and
payment:

2.1. Cryptologic Language Analysts (CLAs). CLAs are authorized FLPB at the Enhancement
Rate at proficiency 2/2 and higher for their CLANG(s). A CLA is defined as any Airman who
has been awarded a 1A8X1 or 1N3 as their primary AFSC.

2.1.1. For CLAs, a CLANG is defined as:

2.1.1.1. Any language acquired through graduation from the Defense Language Institute Foreign
Language Center (DLIFLC) or other DoD-funded training course of comparable length and
content to a DLIFLC initial acquisition course with a graduation or course completion
requirement of 2/2/1+, or;

2.1.1.2. A language for which an Airman has been awarded a 1A8X1 or 1N3 AFSC by the
appropriate CFM.

2.1.2. CLAs serving in a special duty with a Special Duty Identifier or Requirement Identifier
differing from their AFSC are authorized FLPB at the Enhancement Rate at proficiency 2/2 and
higher for their CLANG. Example: An Airman serving as a 1N3 and whose CLANG is
Spanish, but is serving as an 8P000 in a position that does not have a language assigned to it.
The Airman will still be eligible to receive FLPB at the Enhancement Rate for Spanish at 2/2 or
higher, even though Spanish is a PIF language, for as long as eligibility and certification
requirements are met.
                                                                                                  4
2.1.3. CLAs assigned to Air Force Special Operations Command, United States Special
Operations Command or Afghanistan-Pakistan Hands are not eligible to receive sub-2/2 FLPB
for their CLANG and must achieve a 2/2 qualifying score for FLPB.

2.1.4. CLAs who test in multiple languages must either:

2.1.4.1. Provide documentation verifying official training, (examples include, but are not limited
to: a DLI training certificate, Verification of Military Experience and Training, or other proof of
training for each language) or;

2.1.4.2. Provide unit commander’s approval (O-4 or above) verifying mission or other
requirement allowing FLPB at the Enhancement rate for multiple languages.

2.1.4.3. CLAs who receive FLPB for only one language of primary training and who meet the
eligibility requirements outlined in section 2.1, Cryptologic Language Analysts will continue to
receive FLPB at the Enhancement Rate without the need of proof of training.

2.1.5. Airmen who have been awarded a 1A800 or 1N000 AFSC and were previously awarded a
1A8X1 or 1N3 as their primary AFSC, are authorized FLPB at the Enhancement Rate at
proficiency 2/2 and higher for their CLANG(s) as outlined in 2.1.1-2.1.4 above.

2.2. Language-Designated Positions (LDP) Personnel. Airmen assigned to LDPs are
authorized FLPB at the Enhancement Rate at proficiency 2/2 and higher for the language(s)
required for their billet.

2.3. Regional Affairs Strategist (RAS). RAS officers awarded AFSC 16F1X or 16F3X are
authorized FLPB at the Enhancement Rate at proficiency 2/2 and higher for all approved
languages in their assigned region as defined in AFI 16-109, Paragraph 4.2.4, "RAS Regional
Shredouts." For approved languages in their assigned region, PIF designation does not apply.
RAS officers proficient in language(s) outside their assigned region may receive FLPB for those
additional languages IAW paragraph 2.12, All Others.

2.3.1. Non-16F1X and 16F3X (e.g.16F4X) Airmen are authorized FLPB at the Enhancement
Rate at proficiency 2/2 and higher for approved languages in their assigned region only for the
period they are assigned to that billet.

2.4. Language Enabled Airman Program (LEAP) Personnel. Airmen awarded the LEAP
Special Experience Identifier (SEI), YHQ, are authorized FLPB at proficiency 2/2 and higher for
their LEAP CLANG IAW where the language appears on the AF SLL.

2.4.1. For LEAP Airmen, a CLANG is the language for which the Airman was selected for
participation in LEAP.

2.4.2. To maintain accurate FLPB accountability, the LEAP program manager will provide a
quarterly roster of Airmen who have been awarded the YHQ SEI and their CLANGs to
AFPC/DPTOC and AF/A1DG.

                                                                                                   5
2.5. Afghanistan-Pakistan Hands (AFPAK) Hands Personnel. Airmen whose duty title
identifies them as AFPAK Hand are authorized FLPB at the Enhancement Rate at proficiency
1/1 and higher for languages in the AFPAK Hands Program: UR (Urdu), PV (Pushtu, Pashtu or
Pashto), PG (Dari or Persian-Afghan).

2.5.1. To receive sub-2/2 FLPB, Airmen must demonstrate annual improvement in any
modality. Example: If an Airman is receiving FLPB at 1/1, the next year the Airman will be
expected to achieve at least a 1+/1 or 1/1+ to maintain FLPB. The following year, the same
Airman will need to achieve at least a 1+/1+ to continue to receive FLPB.

2.5.2. To maintain accurate FLPB accountability, AF/A1PP shall provide a quarterly roster of
AFPAK Hand graduates along with a respective proficiency-level grade for each student
following completion of each AFPAK Hand class to Airmen to AFPC/DPTOC and AF/A1DG.
When AFPAK Hand members test for re-certification, the new test scores will need to be
compared to previous test scores to determine if the member achieved improvement as outlined
in Section 2.5.1 and thus, if FLPB will be continued for the member.

2.6. Air Force Special Operations Personnel. Airmen assigned to Air Force Special
Operations Command (AFSOC) or United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM),
and in an LDP are authorized FLPB at the Enhancement Rate at proficiency 1/1 and higher for
the language(s) designated by their assigned position.

2.6.1. To receive sub-2/2 FLPB, Airmen must demonstrate annual improvement in any
modality. Example: An Airman is receiving FLPB at 1/1 for Spanish, the next year the Airman
will be expected to achieve at least 1+/1 or 1/1+ to maintain FLPB. The following year the same
Airman will need to achieve at least a 1+/1+ to continue to receive FLPB.

2.6.1.1. When AFSOC or USSOCOM members test for re-certification, the new test scores will
need to be compared to previous test scores to determine if the member achieved improvement
as outlined in Section 2.6.1 and thus, if FLPB will be continued for the member.

2.6.2. Any Career Field Authority, in coordination with the Air Force Senior Language
Authority (AF SLA), may identify other language-coded billets eligible for FLPB at the 1/1 level
or higher.

2.7. Olmsted Scholars. Airmen identified as Olmsted Scholars by the annual AFPC Olmsted
Scholars Release Message and Personnel Services Delivery Memorandum (PSDM) are
authorized FLPB at the Enhancement Rate at proficiency 2/2 and higher for the CLANG for
which they were selected.

2.7.1. For Olmsted Scholars, a CLANG is the language for which the Airman was selected for
participation in the Olmstead Scholar program.

2.7.2. Qualifying Olmsted Scholars are authorized FLPB payment effective the date they were
assigned to the Olmsted duty title until the member is reassigned outside the Olmsted Scholar
duty title.


                                                                                                6
2.7.3. Language proficiency testing must be completed prior to arrival at the Olmsted
scholarship training location.

2.7.4. To maintain accurate FLPB accountability, AFPC/DPAPFE shall provide an annual roster
of Olmsted Scholars and their CLANG to AFPC/DPTOC and AF/A1DG.

2.8. International Professional Military Education (IPME) Students. Airmen enrolled in an
IPME program are authorized FLPB at the Enhancement Rate at proficiency 2/2 and higher for
their CLANG.

2.8.1. For an IPME student, a CLANG is the language for which the Airman was selected for
participation in his/her respective IPME program.

situations are eligible for FLPB at the Enhancement Rate under certain conditions.

2.13.1. Ad-hoc situations include emergency, unplanned, or contingency operations where an
Airman’s foreign language skill is required to support the mission. Rotational or regularly
planned deployments do not constitute an ad-hoc situation. Use of language skill, including PIF
languages, during execution of regularly assigned duties does not constitute an ad-hoc use of
language skills and billets should be coded to include required language skills.

2.13.2. To be eligible, Airmen must achieve a minimum qualifying score of 1/1 on the DLPT or
OPI, if no DLPT is available in the language(s) used for the ad-hoc situation.

OPI system within 90 days of the end of the operational deployment in which their language skill
was required. Ad-hoc FLPB is not intended to replace the need to properly designate billets that
have language requirements.

2.13.4. For ad-hoc requests, FLPB will be paid in a lump sum, upon completion of the ad-hoc
situation, based on the length of time the language was used. Following completion of the ad-
hoc situation and receipt of scores, the Airmen’s commanding officer shall forward a request
through the installation TCO to AFPC/DPSIM. The AF SLA serves as the final approval

                                                                                                  8
authority for ad-hoc requests. All requests shall be on command letterhead and signed by the
commanding officer or designated representative.

3. Exceptions to Policy (ETPs). Submit all ETP requests to FLPB policy as follows:

3.1. For Active Duty Airmen, unit commanders may submit ETPs in writing through their
installation TCO to AFPC/DPSIM. The AF SLA serves as the final approval authority for all
Active Duty FLPB ETP requests.

3.2. For Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard Airmen, unit commanders may submit FLPB
ETP requests to AFRC/A1K and NGB/A1D, respectively, for final approval.

                                  IMPLEMENTING THE SYSTEM

Section 1A—Overview

1.1. Need for Testing. The Air Force Military Personnel Testing System (AFMPTS) helps identify the
right person for the right job. The Air Force uses the system to select and classify individuals and assess
their skills and knowledge in various areas. In general, tests support and enhance human resources man-
agement. The AFMPTS provides instruments to measure aptitudes, knowledge, and other abilities. This
information is combined with other factors such as duty performance, experience, training, and supervisor
and personal interviews.
    1.1.1. The AFMPTS is divided into three programs to cover different phases of the personnel life
    cycle:
       1.1.1.1. Accession and Aptitude Testing: Includes all tests for selecting airmen for service in the
       Air Force and its components. It provides a basis for selecting, classifying, training, and assigning
       personnel by predicting how well an individual will do in an Air Force training program.
       1.1.1.2. Promotion Testing: Includes all tests used to determine the specialty and military knowl-
       edge of airmen for use in promotion decisions. Airmen must take these tests to be considered for
       promotion under the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS) and the Senior Noncommis-
       sioned Officer (SNCO) Promotion Program.
       1.1.1.3. Proficiency Testing: Includes all tests used to identify individuals who have reached a
       level of proficiency required in some special area such as a career specialty or a foreign language.
       Tests not included in this program are proficiency tests used for certification within a single career
       field or Career Development Course (CDC) review tests.

1.2. Use of Tests. Tests approved for use in the AFMPTS are listed in the Air Force Personnel Test
(AFPT) Catalog.
    1.2.1. Organizational Use. Organizations are prohibited from using any test or assessment (including
    commercial tests or assessments) not listed in the AFPT Catalog for any personnel action, no matter
    how small in scope or magnitude, without written approval from HQ USAF/A1PF. No change in the
    manner in which an approved test is used may be made without approval of HQ USAF/A1PF. Excep-
    tion: Tests used to assess progress or mastery within a formal course, psychological tests used in a
    clinical setting, and medical tests do not fall within this requirement.

1.3. Securing Test Materials. The security of all testing materials and programs must receive the highest
priority. To ensure all individuals have an equal opportunity to accurately demonstrate their aptitude,
knowledge, and skills, the AFMPTS mandates standardized testing procedures and conditions. Chapter 5
of this instruction describes test compromise and procedures necessary for securing and safeguarding test

                       MANAGING TEST FACILITIES AND PERSONNEL

2.1. Introduction. Each area of the testing system operation must be standardized to ensure consistency
and fairness. Examinees are highly sensitive to fairness and equity in testing because their scores affect
their careers. The following procedures protect the system, the individual, and the Air Force.

2.2. Establishing a Test Facility: Forward requests through local channels to HQ AFPC Test Manage-
ment Office. If HQ AFPC Test Management Office approves the request an account number will be
assigned and AFPC Test Management Office will notify AFPDC/PPLC. This action places the facility on
the master TCO list and allows the TCO and TE to order required test materials.

2.3. Test Facility Conditions:
   2.3.1. TCOs and TEs must use testing facilities that meet acceptable conditions for testing. At a min-
   imum:
       2.3.1.1. Ensure the testing room meets minimum noise level requirements. Contact the local
       bioenvironmental engineer to measure testing room noise levels. Recommended noise level range
       for testing facilities is 40 to 45dB(A) and must not exceed 60dB(A) for a significant period of
       time. Use necessary acoustic treatments to bring noise levels within the recommended range.
       Never administer personnel tests in locations where other business is being conducted.
       2.3.1.2. Provide adequate, comfortable lighting for the room and working surfaces (minimum 75
       foot candles of illumination at the desk top). Avoid shadows and glare on working surfaces.
       2.3.1.3. Control the ventilation, temperature (between 68 -78 degrees F IAW AFOSH STD
       91-501, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Standard, paragraph 10.15), and humidity to
       provide for examinees' comfort. Do not conduct testing when environmental conditions interfere
       with concentration.
       2.3.1.4. Prohibit smoking, eating, drinking, or any other activity which may disrupt testing (this
       includes TCO / TE).
       2.3.1.5. Prohibit the possession of any personal electronic devices (i.e., watches, beepers, cell
       phones, camera phones, calculating devices, or any other item which could be used to gather,
       store, copy, reproduce, transmit, or receive data).
       2.3.1.6. Arrange the testing room so the TE can see and hear all examinees continually during
       testing sessions. The TE must not be separated from examinees by a partition or window. Do not
       use desks or tables with partitions such as study carrels. Exception: Carrels are authorized for the
       TBAS. Large tables may be used with non-glass partitions of adequate height to separate examin-
       ees as long as they do not obstruct the TE's view. Place examinees far enough apart to prevent
       cheating.
       2.3.1.7. Allow an overall minimum space of 15 square feet per examinee including space for the
       control aisle and aisles for proctoring. Refer to TCO/TE Training Guide for an illustration of how
       a testing room may be arranged.
16                                                                   AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008


        2.3.1.8. Provide a working surface for each examinee that is flat, smooth, free from cracks, and
        provides enough space so that materials do not overlap. Give additional table space to examinees
        whose tests require use of maps or charts.
        2.3.1.9. Do not conduct testing in facilities that fail to meet the minimum standards unless you
        have a waiver to do so. Any waiver granted for inadequate testing facilities is temporary, not to
        exceed one year. Steps should be taken to permanently meet minimum standards listed above.
        2.3.1.10. Requests for waivers of any minimum standard must include justification and a com-
        plete summary of actions being taken to correct deficiencies. Forward the request to HQ AFPC
        Test Management Office.

2.4. Closing a Test Facility:
     2.4.1. When a testing facility is closing, the TCO must notify AFPDC/PPLC and HQ AFPC Test
     Management Office. HQ AFPC Test Management Office then deletes the test facility from the master
     directory and AFPDC/PPLC deletes the account from their lists and cancels requisitions.
     2.4.2. Before a TCO account closes, the TCO must destroy or return all test materials. Complete
     destruction certificates and send them to AFPDC/PPLC and AFOMS Test Development Section, as
     appropriate, after destruction of Controlled Test Material (CTM).

2.5. Appointing and Relieving TCOs: All units authorized to use tests listed in this instruction and the
AFPT Catalog, Index of Personnel Tests, will appoint a TCO. To limit the exposure of CTM, only one
TCO and a maximum of two TEs are authorized per account. Preferably, the TCO is also one of the two
TEs. No more than three personnel are authorized unless a waiver is approved by HQ AFPC Test Manage-
ment Office.
     2.5.1. The FSS Commander or AFROTC Detachment Commander appoints and relieves the TCO by
     memorandum (see Figure 2.1.). Forward a copy of the memorandum to: HQ AFPC /DPSOE, 550 C
     Street W., Ste 9, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4712. Include in the memorandum the new TCO’s name,
     grade, social security number (SSN), e-mail address, phone numbers (voice and fax), and appointment
     effective date. If the TCO will be absent for a long enough period of time to impact TCO duties, the
     TCO should be relieved of duties and a new TCO appointed. The FSS Commander may reappoint the
     TCO after return from the absence. The TCO should normally be the most experienced TE and have
     responsibility for both TCO and TE duties. Under this configuration, a second TE should be appointed
     for each account. If the TCO and TE are not the same person, a second TE is not required. FSS com-
     manders must ensure TCOs have the right qualifications (integrity, maturity, good written and oral
     communication skills, basic computer skills, knowledge of military testing, attention to detail, and the
     ability to understand and comply with procedures in this instruction). TCOs monitor appointments of
     TCOs under their command to ensure qualifications are met. Note: Due to the daily exposure to CTM,
     extreme care should be taken to discern the trustworthiness of the TCO/TE.
     2.5.2. Appoint only one TCO. Do not appoint an alternate, temporary, or emergency TCO.
     2.5.3. TCO must be an officer or Department of Defense civilian with the grade of GS-5 or higher.
     Appointment of an enlisted airman requires a waiver and will generally not be granted.
     2.5.4. WAPS TCOs must possess a SECRET security clearance.
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                             17


   2.5.5. Unless HQ AFPC Test Management Office approves in advance, TCOs must not take a test
   within 6 months of the date they last had access to that particular AFPT. Requests for waivers to this
   requirement must contain the date the TCO last had access to the AFPT, the length of time served as
   TCO, and the testing requirement. Forward the request to HQ AFPC Test Management Office.
   2.5.6. Conduct a TMI in accordance with paragraph 4.2. when a new TCO is appointed.

2.6. Appointing and Relieving TEs:
   2.6.1. The FSS Commander or AFROTC Detachment Commander appoints and relieves TEs by
   memorandum. Include in the memorandum the new TE’s name, grade, SSN, e-mail address, phone
   numbers (voice and fax), and appointment effective date. Forward a copy of the memorandum to HQ
   AFPC Test Management Office as outlined in Table 2.1.
   2.6.2. WAPS TEs must possess a SECRET security clearance.
   2.6.3. Officers or fully qualified civilians (GS-4 or higher) may serve as TEs.
   2.6.4. Individuals on an Air Force contract may be TEs. The contract must contain a clause requiring
   safeguarding of CTM and the appropriate security clearance.
   2.6.5. Unless HQ AFPC Test Management Office approves in advance, TEs must not test within 6
   months of the date they last had access to that particular AFPT. Requests for waivers must contain the
   date the TE last had access to the AFPT, the length of time served as TE, and the testing requirement.
   Forward the request to HQ AFPC Test Management Office.
   2.6.6. Conduct a TMI in accordance with paragraph 4.2. when a new TE is appointed.

2.7. Appointing and Relieving Test Proctors: Test proctors assist the TCO or TE by helping observe
examinees during test administration. The TCO or TE verbally appoints and relieves test proctors. Do not
allow proctors access to actual test material (front cover only). They can only distribute and collect mate-
rials with test booklets closed.
   2.7.1. Appoint military test proctors for promotion testing who are at least one grade higher than the
   highest ranking examinee, regardless of AFS.
   2.7.2. Military test proctors (for all testing other than promotion testing) must be SSgt selectees or
   higher. DAF civilians may be appointed to proctor any type of test administration.
   2.7.3. Determine the minimum number of proctors based on the number of examinees and layout of
   the testing room. Test proctors are not required when testing less than 31 examinees. As a minimum,
   in addition to the TE, use one proctor for 31 to 50 examinees; two proctors for 51 to 75 examinees;
   and one additional proctor for every 25 examinees when testing 76 or more examinees at one time.
   TEs may appoint additional proctors to maintain control and security during testing in unique situa-
   tions.

2.8. Training Test Administration Personnel. TCOs must train personnel appointed to administer their
testing programs and maintain test security. Test administration personnel will use this instruction and the
applicable test administration manuals as guides for training. The TCO/TE Training Guide, checklists,
and local guidance are also appropriate for use in training programs. Test administration personnel must
sign a statement within 60 days of appointment proclaiming their familiarization with testing procedures.
18                                                                        AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008


The FSS Commander or equivalent will acknowledge the competence of the TCO/TE by endorsing the
statement. This statement must be on file in the AFPT security container.

2.9. Recommending Enhancements or Changes to the AFMPTS: Surface any concerns or improve-
ments to the AFMPTS to HQ AFPC Force Management Liaison Office. Include details of the proposed or
revised AFPT and explain why the change is in the best interest of the Air Force as outlined in Attach-
ment 13.

                                                 Chapter 3

                                        ADMINISTERING TESTS

3.1. Standardizing Test Administration: Test administration personnel must administer all AFPTs in
the AFMPTS under uniform conditions using standardized procedures. Use the procedures in this chapter
plus the additional instructions in each administration manual.

3.2. Preparing to Administer Tests: Before administering an AFPT, the TE must:
     3.2.1. Check each test booklet page-by-page for printing errors, missing or blank pages, or any other
     defect. No examinee should be given a test booklet containing marks made by previous examinees. If
     errors are detected, notify HQ AFPC Test Management Office. For WAPS printing errors, also contact
     AFOMS. Immediately order new booklets and destroy the faulty ones unless otherwise directed.
     3.2.2. Review the specific instruction manual for administering the AFPT to understand the purpose
     of the test, its directions, and the materials needed. Rehearse the directions so you can read them aloud
     without error.
     3.2.3. Review procedures to follow during emergency situations that could arise during testing (see
     paragraphs 3.5. and 3.6.).
     3.2.4. Review AFPT 250, Instructions for Administering USAF Promotion Tests, for specific proce-
     dures for emergencies during WAPS testing.
     3.2.5. Verify that enough test booklets, answer sheets, special testing equipment, pencils, erasers, and
     scratch paper are current and available.
     3.2.6. Provide number 2 pencils (minimum two) with serviceable erasers (minimum ¼ inch) and
     blank scratch paper, unless specifically directed otherwise by the administration manual. Do not use
     obsolete forms or form letters as scratch paper. Never keep scoring keys in the testing room during
     testing unless locked in a safe.
     3.2.7. Determine which tests require additional equipment or have illustrations that need more table-
     top space. Provide proper space and privacy for the examinees to prevent the use of special equipment
     from distracting other examinees.
     3.2.8. Appoint the proper number of test proctors and brief them on their duties.

3.3. Administering the Test: The TE will: Note: Test administration begins when the TCO /TE closes
the door to the testing room at the appointed start time.
     3.3.1. Check each examinee’s identification card to verify each individual is the person scheduled for
     testing. Distribute the booklets, answer sheets, and special equipment after the examinees are seated.
     Prohibit examinees from bringing their own equipment such as calculators (including those on
     watches), cassette recorders, pencils, cell phones, personal electronic devices, or any instrument that
     can transmit, receive, or preserve, in any fashion, audio or video data into the testing room. Examinees
     are not allowed to bring in or take out any notes or other study materials.
     3.3.2. Eliminate distracting influences in the surrounding environment. To the extent possible, con-
     firm all examinees are comfortable and not fatigued, ill, or distressed. If the examinee is affected by
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                               21


  one of these conditions, excuse him/her and reschedule testing for a more appropriate time. It is ulti-
  mately the examinees' responsibility to ensure she / he is fit to test, both mentally and physically.
  3.3.3. Try to put the examinees at ease. Start with a brief informal statement explaining the nature and
  purpose of the test, how the results will be used, and why it is important for them to do their best.
  3.3.4. Maintain test security and control of the testing session at all times. Never leave the testing
  room after a testing session begins unless relieved by the TCO or another TE. Exception: For TBAS
  administration, the TE does not have to stay in the testing room. However, the TE must be immedi-
  ately available to answer examinee questions.
  3.3.5. Once all test materials are distributed, read the standardized directions aloud verbatim from the
  administration manual. Do not paraphrase instructions, read instructions from notes or memory, or
  adapt instructions for local conditions. If you must read local instructions, read them before those in
  the AFPT administration manual.
  3.3.6. Explain time limits to the examinees as specified in the AFPT administration manual. Explain
  that these time limits are exact, either for a complete test or for separate parts of a test. Explain to the
  examinees how the test administration will be timed, either by an electric timer, stopwatch, electric
  wall clock, digital clock, or sweep-second-hand watch. When possible, use a timer with an auditory
  signal to eliminate the need for constantly watching the clock. If you use proctors, instruct them to
  check the timing independently and consult with you if they suspect an error in timing. Refer to the
  TCO/TE Training Guide for an example of how to keep accurate testing time. Note: Once established,
  DO NOT change the posted return time for the second WAPS test. Personnel who finish the first test
  early must leave the testing room so those still testing are not distracted. All subsequent time intervals
  are established based on the START time of the first test. No deviations are allowed. For example,
  when giving a WAPS test the start time is 0805 so the stop time will be 0950. Adding 15 minutes for
  a break makes a return time of 1005 hours. The return time cannot be changed once the first testing
  session starts.
  3.3.7. Instruct examinees to stop testing and put their pencils down at the instant they are told time has
  expired. Collect and account for all test materials before dismissing the group. If examinees finish
  testing before time expires, check all their materials before allowing them to leave the testing room.
  When checking the materials, ensure there are no marks in the test booklet and all of the sections of
  the answer sheet have been correctly bubbled in.
  3.3.8. Instruct examinees to fill out an AFPT 230, AFPT Query, according to the instructions at the
  top of the form. Once the examinee has turned in the test material, do not permit the examinee to com-
  plete AFPT 230. Examinee should never be allowed access to test materials after they have been
  turned in to TCO/TE. Refer to Table 3.1. for disposition of AFPTs 230. Test development agencies
  review test queries for consideration in future test development.
  3.3.9. Instruct examinees to leave ALL test materials including scratch paper in the testing room at all
  times. Removing test materials from the testing room is prohibited.
  3.3.10. Test one examinee alone only when absolutely necessary. Follow all procedures in paragraph
  3.3. as carefully and completely as when testing a group. Remain professional and objective. Do not
  give more assistance to a single examinee than to a group.
  3.3.11. Instruct examinees they may not write on the scratch paper provided until after the test starts.
22                                                                    AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008


     3.3.12. Post the return time for personnel returning for a second test prominently in the testing room.
     Inform personnel who are returning to take a second test that they must return on or before the posted
     time. Examinees must return to the testing room following an authorized break during a test adminis-
     tration (for AFOQT, WAPS testing, AFCT, etc.) by the announced and posted time. Terminate the test
     administration for examinees who fail to return on time.

3.4. Handling Cheating Incidents during Test Administration:
     3.4.1. Removing Test Material from the Testing Room. When an examinee attempts to remove actual
     test material from the testing room (including test booklets, portions of test booklets, marked answer
     sheets, and used or unused scratch paper [see paragraph 5.11.2.]), the TE must immediately notify the
     examinees’ chain of command. Take the appropriate actions specified in this instruction for test com-
     promise situations. Active Duty Air Force airmen who violate these prohibitions are subject to punish-
     ment for violation of Article 92, UCMJ, violating a lawful general order or regulation, or other
     applicable articles of the UCMJ.
     3.4.2. Cheating/Failure to Follow Instructions. The TE must notify the TCO if an examinee attempts
     to copy answers from another examinee's answer sheet, does not follow test administration directions
     (begins marking answers on the answer sheet prior to start time, turns to previous subtest, marks addi-
     tional answers after time has expired), or uses notes or other means of gaining an unfair advantage
     during test administration. If the TE discovers cheating/failure to follow instructions, the TE must ter-
     minate the examinee's test and collect all test materials. The TE and TCO must notify their chain of
     command and the airman’s commander. Forward the examinee's answer sheet to the appropriate
     agency (see Table 3.1.) with a note explaining testing was terminated due to cheating/failure to follow
     instructions. In most cases, HQ AFPC will invalidate the individual's test scores and not allow retest-
     ing until the specified retest interval has elapsed. Retesting or rescheduling the test is not allowed
     unless authorized by HQ AFPC Test Management Office. Active duty Air Force airmen who violate
     these prohibitions are subject to punishment for violation of Article 92, UCMJ, violating a lawful gen-
     eral order or regulation, or other applicable articles of the UCMJ.

3.5. Handling Test Interruptions:
     3.5.1. Promotion Testing. Follow procedures in AFPT 250, WAPS Test Administration Manual, if an
     interruption occurs during promotion testing.
     3.5.2. AFOQT Testing. Follow procedures in AFPT 983, AFOQT Manual for Administration if an
     interruption occurs during AFOQT testing.
     3.5.3. TBAS Testing. Follow procedures in the TBAS Operator's Manual if an interruption occurs
     during TBAS testing.
     3.5.4. All Other Testing. Note the time elapsed, collect all test materials, and resume / reschedule test-
     ing as soon as the situation is resolved. When testing is resumed, allow the examinees the remaining
     time to complete testing. Maintain control of all examinees until a decision is made to resume /
     reschedule the testing session.
     3.5.5. Additional Guidance. In any test interruption situation, the TE must consult with the TCO first
     and then contact HQ AFPC Test Management Office if he / she is unsure of proper procedures. If the
     TCO has any doubts at all about what actions to take, contact HQ AFPC Test Management Office
     prior to taking any action.
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                               23


   3.5.6. Follow Up Action. Immediately notify HQ AFPC Test Management Office by message/e-mail
   of the reason testing was terminated, AFPT being administered, number of examinees involved, spe-
   cific procedures followed, and the projected date testing is to be resumed / rescheduled.

3.6. Individual Emergencies:
   3.6.1. If an examinee must be released from testing due to an emergency (for example, family mem-
   ber involved in an accident), note time elapsed, collect all of the individual’s test materials, and
   remind the examinee not to discuss test material. Reschedule the individual to complete testing as
   soon as possible and allow only the time remaining from the original testing session.
   3.6.2. For all testing, do not allow examinees to leave the testing room for a non-emergency or indi-
   vidual break (such as going to the restroom) unless the examinee has a medical statement to substan-
   tiate the need to take an individual break during the testing session. In such cases, provide an escort
   who meets TE grade requirements and keep track of testing time. Time allotted for break does not
   count as part of examinee’s testing time. Terminate testing if an examinee without a medical statement
   leaves the testing session after testing has begun. Before the individual leaves, explain that the test
   will be terminated and again ask if the examinee needs to be excused. Forward the examinee's answer
   sheet to the appropriate agency (see Table 3.1.) for scoring with a note explaining why testing was ter-
   minated or hand-score it if it is a test scored locally. Note: Prior to releasing the airman, note the time
   elapsed during the testing session.

3.7. Testing During Local and Command Exercises and Inspections. Continue testing as scheduled
during local or command exercises and inspections. Examinees are exempt from responding to simulated
exercise scenarios during testing.

3.8. Post-Test Administration: After test administration, the TE will:
   3.8.1. Inspect test booklets for missing pages and stray marks of any kind after every testing session.
   Completely erase answers or marks if possible. If a page or pages have been torn out, secure the test
   booklet (possible compromise evidence) and notify the TCO. If the TE cannot completely erase marks
   or if a booklet is worn or torn, destroy it according to procedures in Chapter 4. It is extremely impor-
   tant that examinees do not receive test booklets that have any marks which could influence responses.
   3.8.2. Handle scratch paper as CTM and destroy it according to procedures in paragraph 4.3.
   3.8.3. Prepare answer sheets for mailing (if required) according to Table 4.1. Use Table 3.1. to deter-
   mine when and where to mail answer sheets and associated materials.
   3.8.4. Before destroying any test materials following a test session, the TE must ensure all answer
   sheets have been accounted for so that none are inadvertently destroyed.
   3.8.5. Suspense a partially completed AFPT 230 for 7 calendar days from the date the examinee takes
   the test. Do not allow examinees who return to complete PART IV access to the test booklet. For
   WAPS Testing, if the examinee does not return to complete PART IV within 7 calendar days but the
   AFPT 230 contains information in either the QUERY JUSTIFICATION or SOURCE REFERENCE
   blocks of PART IV, mail the form to AFOMS (WAPS only). Destroy as CTM AFPTs 230 which do
   not contain a source reference or justification. Examinees may only return to complete PART IV of an
   AFPT 230 that was initiated during the testing session. They may not return to initiate a new AFPT
   230 after leaving the testing room.

3.9. Supporting GSUs: Normally, the Military Testing Facility provides testing support to those GSUs it
services. Military Testing Facility will:
     3.9.1. Send an authorized TE to the GSU to administer required tests or go to the GSU to administer
     the tests. The TCO may make arrangements to have GSU personnel tested at the Military Testing
     Facility closest to their location. If the servicing Military Testing Facility uses an alternate location, it
     must schedule testing and forward the required AFPT materials to the testing location. See Chapter 4
     for specific instructions for transporting CTM.
     3.9.2. If the options in paragraph 3.9.1. are not feasible or practical, appoint a special TCO (STCO) at
     the GSU if the GSU commander concurs. STCOs may not delegate any of their duties to other indi-
     viduals. STCOs must conform to the same restrictions and qualifications as regular TCOs. Before an
     STCO may be appointed, the servicing TCO must verify the STCO can secure test materials in a secu-
     rity container to which only authorized personnel have access.
         3.9.2.1. FSS Commander appoints the STCO by memorandum. Send two copies to the STCO.
         STCOs acknowledge by return endorsement that they have been trained and thoroughly under-
         stand their duties, the contents of this instruction, and applicable test administration instructions.
         The STCO returns one copy to the TCO for file and keeps one copy. Send an approved copy of the
         STCO letter to HQ AFPC Test Management Office.
         3.9.2.2. In certain unique instances, such as the non-availability of Air Force personnel who meet
         STCO requirements, the Air Force may appoint an individual from another branch of service as
         STCO. These STCOs must meet the same requirements as Air Force STCOs. The servicing TCO
         must reach an appropriate agreement with the STCO's unit and branch of service and get final
         approval from the GSU commander. The GSU commander appoints the non-Air Force STCO by
         memorandum following procedures outlined in paragraph 3.9.3.1. Because other services are usu-
         ally not familiar with Air Force testing programs, be sure to thoroughly train the non-Air Force
         STCO on the AFMPTS.
         3.9.2.3. The servicing TCO must train the STCO on the AFMPTS, all testing procedures, security,
         and the importance of testing to an individual's career opportunities. The servicing TCO must pro-
         vide the STCO all instructions and information required to properly handle and administer tests.
         The servicing TCO must verify testing facilities comply with requirements in this instruction. A
         statement from the GSU commander describing the facilities fulfills this requirement.
         3.9.2.4. STCOs do not requisition AFPTs. Servicing TCOs provide all necessary test materials.
         However, STCOs may maintain non-WAPS tests if there is a frequent requirement for their admin-
         istration at the site (i.e., a foreign language test) and they can be properly secured.
         3.9.2.5. The servicing TCO or TE packages and mails all test materials to the STCO according to
         procedures in Chapter 4. The TCO or TE signs the inner envelope in the upper left-hand corner
         and annotates any special instructions such as authorization to use a hand calculator, or other spe-
         cial equipment. Include an AF Form 310, Document Receipt and Destruction Certificate.
         3.9.2.6. After receiving the package from the TCO, the STCO accounts for all materials in the
         package, signs and returns the receipt copy of the AF Form 310 to the TCO. The STCO will
         administer the tests at the earliest practical time and return all test materials to the TCO within 7
         calendar days after use. Use the mailing procedures in Chapter 4.

3.10. General Test Scoring Procedures:
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                          25


  3.10.1. Test Scoring. The TE or TCO scores tests when there is no centralized scoring facility. Study
  this instruction and the appropriate instructions for scoring tests. To ensure 100% accuracy, work in
  conditions free of distractions. Always have scoring double-checked. If the TE performs the initial
  scoring, the TCO or another TE must double-check it. Do not deviate from scoring instructions for
  specific AFPTs.
  3.10.2. Scoring Keys. Do not reproduce answer keys.
  3.10.3. Recording Scores. Record raw and converted scores on appropriate documentation such as
  local form letters or update the personnel data system as specified in this instruction. Give a copy of
  the scores to the examinee and file a copy in the personnel record. Record scores on answer sheets
  only if the scoring instructions require it.
  3.10.4. Using AFPT Answer Sheets. Only use answer sheets listed in AFPT Catalog. Do not repro-
  duce blank or filled-in AFPT 851 or AFPT 987 answer sheets. Forward any unusual requests for using
  answer sheets to HQ AFPC Test Management Office.

                                                 Chapter 4

                               HANDLING ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS

4.1. Submitting a Requisition:
     4.1.1. Only appointed TCOs and TEs may requisition AFPT materials indexed in the AFPT Catalog.
     If an unusual request for AFPT material should arise from an individual or agency outside the Air
     Force, contact or refer the requester to HQ AFPC Test Management Office.
     4.1.2. Submit requisitions according to procedures in the AFPT Catalog. Pay particular attention to
     the number of tests ordered. Only order enough booklets to support known requirements.
     4.1.3. The Air Force distributes some AFPTs to the using activities as they are published. All other
     AFPT materials must be ordered upon announcement or as needed. Check the AFPT Catalog, letters,
     and messages for announcements of new or revised AFPT materials. Submit requisitions for test mate-
     rials only when you have a recurring requirement. For example, do not order every language test listed
     in the AFPT Catalog
     4.1.4. Upon receipt of tests, the TCO and TE must jointly verify receipt of materials listed on the doc-
     ument receipt, sign the receipt form, and return the receipt to AFPDC/PPLC for non-promotion tests
     or to AFOMS for promotion tests. Accounts whose document receipts are delinquent by more than 30
     days will be frozen by HQ AFPC Test Management Office and future requisitions will not be filled
     until the delinquency is resolved.

4.2. Conducting TMIs. TMIs ensure accountability and security of all test materials. Because they are
vital to the integrity of our testing system, they must be conducted in a manner that is above reproach.
Account for all test materials with the TMI listing during each inventory. The TCO/TE Training Guide
contains guidance for conducting TMIs.
     4.2.1. AFOMS and AFPDC/PPLC produce TMI listings for the testing material each account is
     responsible for on 1 July each year. All TMIs will be sent electronically to each TCO account. TMIs
     must be completed by 15 August. HQ AFPC Test Management Office may waive this requirement
     only under extreme circumstances. Also conduct TMIs when a new TCO or primary TE is appointed.
     4.2.2. The TCO conducts the July TMI with an impartial official (see paragraph 4.2.2.1.). Choose a
     person who does not have duties associated with the testing organization (not in the FSS chain of com-
     mand) to ensure objectivity and strict control. Exception: AFROTC units are exempt from the
     requirement that the impartial official not have duties associated with the organization; however, the
     impartial official must not have duties associated with the unit's testing program.
        4.2.2.1. When a new TCO is appointed the current TCO and previous TCO conduct a TMI within
        7 calendar days of appointment. When a new TE is appointed the TCO and the new TE conduct a
        TMI within 7 calendar days of appointment.
        4.2.2.2. The Impartial Official. This is a commissioned officer or a DAF civilian with a minimum
        grade of GS-07 from outside of the FSS. The impartial official conducts only front cover reviews
        to verify AFPT and copy numbers and must not see the test material. The impartial official must
        also review all test storage facilities and verify that security container combinations have been
        changed at appropriate times as specified in paragraph 5.5.8.
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                            31


   4.2.3. TMI Listings. AFPDC/PPLC listing shows all AFPTs (except promotion tests) charged to the
   TCO account. The AFOMS listing shows all promotion tests charged to the TCO account. AFPTs are
   removed from the lists only after receiving a destruction document from the TCO account or the offi-
   cial documents show a discrepancy on the TMI listing.
   4.2.4. Obsolete AFPTs. Handle them as CTM and destroy according to paragraph 4.3.
   4.2.5. How to Conduct TMIs. Inventories must reflect disposition (present or destroyed ) of all
   AFPTs. The inventorying officials must verify destruction of test materials and annotate the TMI list-
   ing to reflect discrepancies and status of efforts to resolve them. The TCO/TE Training Guide contains
   guidance for conducting TMIs.
   4.2.6. Disposition of TMI Listings. AFPDC/PPLC (for non-promotion AFPTs) and AFOMS (for pro-
   motion AFPTs) transmit the TMI listing electronically. After completing the TMI, the TCO keeps one
   annotated copy.
      4.2.6.1. For the promotion test TMI sent from AFOMS, a copy of the completed TMI must be
      returned to AFOMS. If the copy of the completed TMI is delinquent by more than 30 days, HQ
      AFPC Test Management Office will freeze the account preventing TCOs from ordering test mate-
      rial.
      4.2.6.2. For the non-promotion test TMI sent from AFPDC/PPLC, a copy of the completed TMI
      is not returned to AFPDC/PPLC unless used as the destruction certificate.
      4.2.6.3. Inventorying officials must sign all copies.
      4.2.6.4. The FSS Commander must authenticate the TMI listing by co-signing. By signing the
      WAPS TMI, the FSS Commander is also verifying compliance of the testing program with all
      established testing policies (i.e., test security, storage, scheduling, administration, destruction).
      4.2.6.5. TCOs must file the current and previous TMI listings as specified in AFMAN 37-139.
   4.2.7. TMI Discrepancies. If officials discover or suspect any discrepancies during a TMI, the TCO or
   TE must advise HQ AFPC Test Management Office. The TCO or TE must also notify AFOMS if the
   discrepancies concern promotion tests. If the TCO cannot resolve the differences after contacting HQ
   AFPC Test Management Office or AFOMS, the TCO must initiate a test compromise investigation
   within 7 calendar days from the date of initial discovery following the procedures in paragraph 5.16.
   of this AFI.

4.3. Destroying AFPT Materials:
   4.3.1. Burn or shred AFPTs when authorized by the AFPT Catalog or directed by HQ AFPC Test
   Management Office. Destroy superseded editions of AFPTs within 30 days of receiving revised edi-
   tions or other instructions, except if otherwise directed by HQ AFPC Test Management Office.
   Destroy AFPT materials that are no longer useable due to normal wear and tear. Destroy AFPT mate-
   rials in the form of cassette tapes, compact disks, or plastic scoring keys with scissors and dispose of
   accordingly. Destroy used scratch paper as CTM.
   4.3.2. When classified (SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL) AFPT material is surplus, damaged, or
   obsolete, destroy it only as specified in DoD 5200.1- R/AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
   Management.
32                                                                  AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008


     Note 1: For shredding, use only GSA approved cross-cut shredders that produce pieces no larger than
     1/16” by 1 ¼”.
     Note 2: Completed WAPS answer sheets for expired promotion tests are no longer CTM. Therefore,
     handle and dispose of as “For Official Use Only” materials.
     4.3.3. A witnessing official must be present when the TCO, TE, or the responsible custodian of the
     material at AFPDC/PPLC destroys CTM. The witness must meet at least civilian TE grade require-
     ments or be a commissioned officer. The TCO and TE must not serve together as the destroying and
     witnessing officials. The witnessing official must be from outside the agency (not in the FSS chain of
     command). The witnessing official must verify destruction based on front cover inspection only.
     Exception: In AFROTC units, the witnessing official may be assigned to the detachment but must not
     have duties associated with the unit's testing program.
     4.3.4. Prepare AF Form 310, an official memorandum, or another approved form or list for use as a
     destruction certificate. The destruction certificate must include the TCO number, AFPT numbers and
     edition dates, booklet copy numbers, destruction date, and destruction certification. The destroying
     and witnessing officials sign the destruction certificate after the materials have been destroyed. For-
     ward a copy of the completed destruction certificate to AFPDC/PPLC for non-promotion tests or
     AFOMS for promotion tests. The TCO, TE, or the responsible custodian must maintain the original
     destruction certificate until the materials are removed from the TMI.

4.4. Mailing AFPT Materials: Package CTM according to Table 4.1. Do not indicate on any outer label
or outside wrapping that the package contains AFPT materials. If the package needs identification, use a
local control number. For tracking and accountability purposes, CTM packages must not be included as
part of a larger consolidated package. CTM packages must be mailed separately.
     4.4.1. Completed Test Answer Sheets. Mail completed answer sheets containing test answers by cer-
     tified mail or commercially available express-mail service. Do not use a shipping receipt. Include a
     transmittal memorandum, AFPT 237, or machine list that gives the names, SSNs, and grades of the
     individuals tested with other required information in the same order as the AFPT 237. Refer to the
     attachments of this instruction on specific testing programs for additional procedures regarding mail-
     ing of answer sheets. Refer to Table 3.1. for specific addresses.
     4.4.2. AFPT 230, AFPT Query. Mail test queries by registered mail or commercially available
     express-mail service to the appropriate review agency. Do not use a shipping receipt. Refer to AFPT
     250 for additional guidance. Refer to Table 3.1. for specific addresses.
     4.4.3. All Other CTM. Mail all actual or suspected test material by registered mail or commercially
     available express-mail service. Include an AF Form 310 or shipping receipt. The TCO/TE Training
     Guide contains an example of a completed AF Form 310.
     4.4.4. Handling Unpublished Test Manuscripts and Suspected Test Material in Test Compromise
     Investigations. Follow all precautions pertaining to accessing, wrapping, storing, and shipping for an
     unpublished manuscript of an AFPT, suspected test material, or any materials identified as CTM.

                                                Chapter 5

                       SAFEGUARDING CONTROLLED TEST MATERIAL

5.1. Introduction. This chapter defines CONTROLLED TEST MATERIAL (CTM) and outlines proce-
dures for handling this material. It prohibits certain uses of test materials and further provides for disci-
plinary action of airmen under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and Department of the Air
Force (DAF) civilians under AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse Actions, for violating these prohibitions.

5.2. Authority. Title 5, U.S.C. 301, Departmental Regulations (Powers), permits a department head to
issue instructions, consistent with law, governing the custody, preservation, and use of the department
records. Accordingly, the Department of the Air Force established an identification or notation to protect
materials vital to the AFMPTS. This identification, CONTROLLED TEST MATERIAL, applies to AFPT
materials described in this instruction and those listed in the AFPT Catalog. Such materials are exempt
from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, Title 5, U.S.C. Section 552, Public Information;
Agency Rules, Opinions, Records, and Proceedings (Administrative Procedures), as implemented by DoD
Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program. The Secretary has
determined CTM to be privileged information, the disclosure of which would be detrimental to the public
interest in accordance with Military Rule of Evidence 506.

5.3. Safeguarding AFPTs. Anyone involved in any fashion with testing or test materials must protect
CTM from unauthorized access and disclosure AT ALL TIMES. To help provide this protection, the
majority of AFPTs and most other actual test materials are marked accordingly. Personnel tests that con-
tain classified security information described in AFI 31-401 are identified as CONFIDENTIAL or
SECRET in addition to CONTROLLED TEST MATERIAL. Safeguard all AFPTs and related materials at
their maximum classification level. Only HQ AFPC Test Management Office may authorize release of
CTM to persons, agencies, or foreign governments otherwise not entitled to it. Treat the following as
CTM:
     5.3.1. All test booklets, test media, and scoring keys listed in the AFPT Catalog, unless specifically
     listed as ”For Official Use Only.”
     5.3.2. Test answer sheets listed in the AFPT Catalog when any portion of the answer sheet is
     marked. (See paragraph 4.3.2., Note 2 for exception.)
     5.3.3. Scratch paper used by examinees during testing.
     5.3.4. All materials that are used in the development of AFPTs listed in the AFPT Catalog. Excep-
     tion: If the test itself is not CTM, then the completed answer sheets, scratch paper, or development
     materials associated with it are not CTM.
     5.3.5. DoD tests and related materials unless otherwise specified by HQ AFPC Test Management
     Office.
     5.3.6. Obsolete test materials pending destruction.
     5.3.7. Information which is known, believed, or suspected to contain actual test material.
     5.3.8. Any agency that sends CTM by USPS or civilian contract carrier must ensure the materials are
     received by the appropriate agency in a timely manner. The sender is also obligated to notify HQ
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                           37


   AFPC Test Management Office and initiate tracking action by the carrier when packages are late,
   missing or undelivered.

5.4. Access to CTM:
   5.4.1. Authorized Access. No individual shall access, obtain, possess, transmit, copy, distribute; or
   allow any unauthorized individual to access, obtain, possess, transmit, copy, or distribute actual or
   suspected test materials except as specified in this instruction. Only the following individuals are
   authorized access to CTM (exception to this policy requires written approval from HQ AFPC Test
   Management Office):
      5.4.1.1. TCOs, TEs, and STCOs when appointed by a letter signed by the appropriate authority.
      5.4.1.2. Personnel employed in test development, scoring, printing, and distribution. Agencies
      included are AFOMS (for promotion tests), HQ AFPC Test Management Office, and HQ USAF/
      A1PF.
      5.4.1.3. Examinees during an authorized testing session. Note: Authorization extends only to the
      specific tests necessary to meet eligibility requirements as identified in the master promotion file
      for a specific promotion cycle. Knowingly taking the wrong promotion test constitutes a compro-
      mise and renders the examinee punishable under the UCMJ.
      5.4.1.4. Senior NCOs, civilians, and officers specifically named by test development agencies to
      review certain personnel tests when authorized in writing by HQ AFPC Test Management Office.
      In addition, AFOMS may grant access to previous SMEs and other individuals who must use their
      expertise to evaluate test materials.
      5.4.1.5. Inspectors (MSgt or above, or civilian GS-5 or above) who may only make front cover
      checks in the presence of the TCO or TE. In extraordinary cases, inspectors may review test mate-
      rial if authorized by HQ AFPC Test Management Office. Send complete justification for the
      review to HQ AFPC Test Management Office. Include the names, SSNs, grades, AFSs, and units
      of assignment of the reviewing individuals in the justification memorandum.
      5.4.1.6. Only AFOSI special agents who are commissioned officers or DoD civilians may access
      test materials in the performance of official duties. Non-AFOSI investigators must get written
      approval from HQ AFPC Test Management Office before gaining access to CTM when investigat-
      ing test compromise cases.
      5.4.1.7. During or following a test compromise investigation, it may be necessary for the SJA,
      commander, defense counsel, and others involved in the legal process to review CTM. When dis-
      closure cannot be avoided, limit disclosure pursuant to Military Rule of Evidence 506. HQ AFPC
      Test Management Office will authorize or deny access in writing. Military judges, staff judge
      advocates, commanders at all levels and defense counsels must ensure that the material is safe-
      guarded in accordance with this instruction. They must also ensure access to court documents
      incorporating CTM is not granted to anyone unless authorized by HQ AFPC Test Management
      Office.
      5.4.1.8. Public disclosure of CTM during a court-martial must be avoided whenever possible.
      Prior to a trial by court-martial, trial counsel must submit a written request to HQ AFPC Test Man-
      agement Office to seek authorization for court participants, including the accused, bailiff, wit-
38                                                                   AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008


        nesses, and court members to have limited access to CTM before, during, and in some cases, after
        a trial by court-martial.
     5.4.2. Unauthorized Access. No individual may access test material other than those listed in para-
     graph 5.4.1., regardless of their relationship to or command over individuals authorized access, unless
     they have written authorization from HQ AFPC Test Management Office. This includes any individ-
     ual above, below, or lateral to the TCO. Unauthorized access constitutes a test compromise and must
     be investigated. In the case of a court-martial, CTM disclosure to unauthorized parties or CTM inclu-
     sion in a disclosable record must be reported to HQ AFPC Test Management Office.
     5.4.3. SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL AFPTs: For access to CTM classified as SECRET or CONFI-
     DENTIAL, a person must also meet the requirements for access to materials bearing those security
     classifications as specified in AFI 31-401.

5.5. Storage of CTM:
     5.5.1. Each person who has access to CTM is responsible for safeguarding the information.
     5.5.2. When not under the personal control or observation of an authorized person, CTM must be
     locked in a GSA-approved security container of the type approved to store Secret data. (Future refer-
     ence to security containers includes steel cabinets or vaults. Use of other containers must be autho-
     rized in writing by HQ AFPC Test Management Office).
     5.5.3. A CTM cover sheet must be used to protect and identify all CTM. See Figure 5.2 for an exam-
     ple of a suitable cover sheet.
     5.5.4. In the work area, CTM must always be hand-carried from one point to another and must always
     have an appropriate CTM cover sheet attached when not in a security container. Transfers of CTM
     must be made person-to-person. The receiver of the CTM must verbally acknowledge the classifica-
     tion level of the material before custody is transferred. An IN/OUT basket must not be used for dispo-
     sition of CTM documents.
     5.5.5. CTM must not be left unattended or unsecured for any length of time. If persons working with
     CTM leave the work area, they must either secure the material in a security container or physically
     transfer possession of the material to another authorized person who meets the established criteria to
     handle CTM.
     5.5.6. Store tests together regardless of security classification. Do not store classified test materials
     with other classified material. Store classified test materials with other unclassified test materials.
     When storing classified test material with CTM the rules in AFI 31-401 apply. Exception: AFOMS is
     exempt from this requirement.
     5.5.7. Only TCOs and TEs may have access to security container combinations. Normally, only two
     individuals (the TCO and the TE) have the combinations. Limit access to the absolute minimum
     personnel required to support the testing mission.
     5.5.8. Change security container combinations and TBAS passwords within 7 calendar days of the
     date of the letter relieving a TCO or TE. Also, change security container combinations and TBAS
     passwords when:
        5.5.8.1. Anyone knowing the combination or password is relieved, transferred, under investiga-
        tion for possible test compromise, or separated.

5.6. Keeping an Inspection Record: Those who have access to security containers must use inspection
procedures and forms (SF 701, Activity Security Checklist, and SF 702, Security Container Check Sheet)
as required by AFI 31-401. Before leaving the area at the end of each day, individuals must have another
person complete SF 702 to verify that the security container is locked and the area is secure. Only when
another person is not available to complete SF 702 may one individual complete the form to verify the
locking of the security container.

     material with anyone (see paragraph 5.14.).
     5.9.4. Questioning examinees for the purpose of determining test content. Exception: HQ AFPC Test
     Management Office may give written approval for specific exceptions to this prohibition on a
     case-by-case basis. For example, questioning examinees cooperating in a test compromise investiga-
     tion.
     5.9.5. Reproducing or copying any test material, including suspected test material, in whole or part,
     for any purpose. Exception: Test development agencies authorized access to test material may repro-
     duce or copy actual test material without authorization from HQ AFPC Test Management Office.
     However, they must have authorization from their unit, division, or flight security manager. Excep-
     tion: AFOSI detachments may reproduce or copy suspected test material without authorization from
     HQ AFPC Test Management Office when necessary for investigative analysis; however, it must be
     safeguarded IAW the rules stated herein and access/distribution kept to the absolute minimum.
     Exception: Trial counsel may reproduce or copy actual test material without authorization from HQ
     AFPC Test Management Office when necessary for administrative or judicial action during the con-
     duct of proceedings. This exception does not include copying materials for use in case preparation by
     either trial counsels or defense counsels. For case preparation, materials will be made available for
     review by all counsels and appropriate witnesses at the AFOSI office under controlled conditions.
        5.9.5.1. During court proceedings, access to CTM will be limited to only those personnel who
        have been granted access by HQ AFPC Test Management Office. Personnel requiring access to
        CTM (i.e.) military judge, trial counsel, military defense counsel, civilian defense counsel, court
        members, bailiff, administrative personnel, witnesses), must be submitted through the lead trial
        counsel and authorized in writing by HQ AFPC Test Management Office.
        5.9.5.2. CTM must be properly safeguarded at all times before, during, and following court pro-
        ceedings and stored in an authorized security container when unattended.
     5.9.6. Training that concentrates on "teaching the test" or that emphasizes information known or
     believed to be on a specific test.
     5.9.7. Reviewing contents of AFPTs by inspection team members or any other reviewing officials at
     any level of command without written approval from HQ AFPC Test Management Office. Exception:

   receive CTM.
   5.9.12. Requisitioning any CTM or other test materials listed in the AFPT Catalog except by a duly
   appointed and authorized TCO or TE.
   5.9.13. Improperly storing test materials. Refer to paragraph 5.5. for proper storage procedures.
   5.9.14. Gaining access to any security container containing CTM unless specifically authorized.
   5.9.15. Purchase, sale, distribution, unauthorized access, or possession of actual test materials or the
   specific contents of testable material.

5.10. Test Compromise Prohibitions for TCOs, TEs, and Test Development Personnel:
   5.10.1. Using or possessing an actual test or testable materials for the purpose of assisting an exam-
   inee or potential examinee.
   5.10.2. Leaving an examinee unsupervised for any length of time during a test administration session
   for any reason. Exception: Personnel administering the TBAS do not have to be in the same room but
   must be immediately available to the examinee.
   5.10.3. Inability to account for test materials at any time.
   5.10.4. Possessing CTM (except completed answer sheets) not listed on the TCO account inventory
   or other accountability document.
   Exception: Possessing test materials received after the last inventory that have not yet appeared on
   the current inventory.
   5.10.5. Improper packaging or labeling of CTM for mailing (including testable materials being trans-
   ferred for analysis as part of a test compromise investigation) which might create an unauthorized dis-
   closure. The receiving agency determines if a compromise occurred due to improper packaging and
   mailing procedures.
   5.10.6. Transferring any CTM without a properly executed AF Form 310 except as noted in this
   instruction.
   5.10.7. Improperly destroying test materials.

   under any circumstances, actual test material (highlighted or otherwise), marked testable material, or
   written comments relating to test questions or areas of study that would imply to the recipient that
   such items or areas may be on the test.

5.11. Test Compromise Prohibitions for Examinees and Potential Examinees:
   5.11.1. Discussing/divulging actual test material or the specific contents of testable material. Some
   examples of this type of compromise would be: Actual test material in Air Force suggestions, Con-
42                                                                   AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008


     gressional inquiries, or IG complaints. Exception: When an individual wants to submit such corre-
     spondence and include test material, the individual must first get written approval through TCO
     channels from HQ AFPC Test Management Office. If approved, the rules governing protection of
     CTM apply.
     5.11.2. Removing actual test material from the testing room. This includes but is not limited to all test
     booklets or portions of test booklets, marked answer sheets, any documents marked CTM; all materi-
     als listed in AFPT Catalog that are not marked CTM, such as test rosters, administration manuals,
     unused answer sheets; scratch paper used during test administration and calculators or associated
     equipment provided by the TCO or TE, and notes or media of any type containing information from a
     test.
     5.11.3. Using highlighted or marked testable material that reflects actual or suspected test material
     that is shared between, used by, or observed by more than one examinee or potential examinee or any
     unauthorized individual.
     5.11.4. Using marked pretests that are shared between, used by, or observed by more than one exam-
     inee or potential examinee or any unauthorized individual.
     5.11.5. Using another individuals’s personal study notes.
     5.11.6. Copying answers from another airman’s answer sheet or asking another examinee for help
     during the test administration session.

5.12. Test Compromise Prohibitions Against Using Government Computers:
     5.12.1. To eliminate the potential for intentional or inadvertent test compromise of AFPTs, examinees
     and potential examinees are prohibited from using government computers to create, store, or transfer
     their personal study notes, regardless of whether or not they contain actual test content. Potential
     examinees may use government computers to review electronic versions of official study references
     (i.e., AFPAM 36-2241, Professional Development Guide, Air Force Instructions, Air Force Pam-
     phlets, Air Force Policy Directives, and Technical Orders).
     5.12.2. Using government computers to study commercial study guides is also prohibited (see para-
     graph 5.13.2. below).

5.13. Prohibitions Against Developing and Using Commercial Study Guides:
     5.13.1. Anyone on active duty or employed by the Air Force who has had access to a particular cate-
     gory of AFPT (such as promotion tests) may not participate in any way in the development of a com-
     mercial study guide or pretest for that category of AFPT, whether or not the guide captures actual test
     materials. For example, an airman, NCO, or officer who has taken the AFOQT is prohibited from
     developing a study guide for the AFOQT.
     5.13.2. Use of legally developed commercial study guides, though not recommended, endorsed, or
     supported by the Air Force, does not constitute a compromise as defined in this instruction. However,
     sharing a marked or unmarked commercial study guide in whole or in part with anyone is prohibited.
     Placing commercial study guide software on government computers is prohibited since this would
     imply Air Force sanctioning of the guide and would provide an unfair advantage to those individuals
     with government computer access. Similarly, commercial study guides may not be purchased with
     government funds.
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                             43


   5.13.3. Use of locally developed test-question generating software by using testable material is pro-
   hibited and may not be placed on government computers. This includes, but is not limited to, locally
   developed CDC practice tests.

5.14. Prohibitions Against Group Study. Group study is strictly prohibited. Group study is defined as
anyone who studies for an AFPT with another person or discusses / shares in any form with any other per-
son: 1) information about actual test material or 2) marked or highlighted testable material. Placing test-
able material on a group drive, internet web page, bulletin board, etc., is similarly defined as group study
and is prohibited. Group study prohibits study with not only other examinees but any other person,
including but not limited to commanders, supervisors, coworkers, roommates, friends, and military or
civilian spouses. Group study does NOT include the following individual actions:
   5.14.1. An examinee discussing actual test material or test questions with the TCO, TE, or STCO in
   private when submitting a query.
   5.14.2. Participating in or conducting training to improve general study or test-taking skills. The
   training should be applicable in both the military and civilian environment. Examples of this training
   could include general information on outlining, note-taking, developing reading skills, etc. This train-
   ing may not focus on preparing for selection or promotion tests.
   5.14.3. Participating in or conducting upgrade training, on-the-job training, qualification training, or
   training to improve general military knowledge. You may use study reference materials for these types
   of training when the intent of the training is not to study for promotion tests. Examples of this type of
   training include upgrade training; increasing job proficiency in particular tasks (qualification train-
   ing); and study preparation for below-the-zone promotion and NCO-of-the-quarter type boards. These
   types of training must not focus on preparing for promotion tests.
   5.14.4. Exchanging unaltered study materials such as AFPAM 36-2241, CDCs, or other testable
   material developed by an authorized source if no discussion takes place at any time regarding content
   of the materials.
   5.14.5. Exchanging information and marked materials for job-related reasons that are not directly
   related to testing. This is limited to professional military education (PME) information and course
   manuals, training information, or any other documentary material that is distributed at a training
   course.
   5.14.6. Normal conversations and duty-related discussions between examinees and/or potential
   examinees as long as they are not intended to prepare an individual for a specific AFPT.
   5.14.7. Using personal study techniques to review study materials while preparing for a specific
   AFPT as long as those personal study materials are not reviewed, used, observed by, or shared with
   anyone.

5.15. Other Prohibitions. Although not a compromise of test materials as defined in this instruction, the
following actions are also prohibited. Military personnel, including members of the ANG or Air Force
Reserve who violate the following testing prohibitions, could receive administrative or punitive action
under Article 92, UCMJ, or other applicable UCMJ articles. Air Force civilian employees or contract per-
sonnel who violate the following testing prohibitions could face adverse administrative action without
regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions for violating related laws.
   5.15.1. Changing correct test scores or entering or reporting incorrect test scores on official records.
44                                                                   AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008


     5.15.2. Not following the specific instructions read by the TCO or TE during test administration. For
     example, returning to a previous subtest in the test booklet or marking additional answers on the
     answer sheet after the allotted time has expired for that subtest or beginning to answer questions prior
     to being told to begin.
     5.15.3. Using equipment not authorized during test administration, such as an unapproved calculator.
     5.15.4. Being unable to account for tests listed in AFPT Catalog that are not designated CTM but are
     For Official Use Only (FOUO). Some examples of these are the Air Force Reading Abilities Test
     (AFRAT) and the Enlistment Screening Test (EST).

5.16. Actions to Take on Compromise Cases:
     5.16.1. Anyone who knows of or suspects a compromise of CTM must immediately report this infor-
     mation to his or her supervisor and the TCO.
     5.16.2. The TCO must immediately report this information to the FSS Commander or TCO's com-
     mander, as appropriate, who must then report the information to the installation commander or equiv-
     alent through command channels.
     5.16.3. The Installation Commander, vice commander, or equivalent, takes the following actions
     within one day of notification:
        5.16.3.1. Notifies the AFOSI of a possible test compromise.
        5.16.3.2. Appoints a commissioned officer (Captain or higher) or civilian (GS-7 or higher) as the
        Investigating Officer (IO). The IO acts independently and becomes the point of contact (POC) and
        liaison to the installation commander. He / she conducts the investigation if the AFOSI declines to
        investigate. Note: The investigating officer must not be selected from the group in which the com-
        promise is suspected to have taken place.
     5.16.4. The IO takes the following actions upon appointment:
        5.16.4.1. Notifies the Air Force Test Management Office by memorandum, electronic media, or
        message (e-mail preferred). Include all appropriate details. Mark correspondence “FOR OFFI-
        CIAL USE ONLY-- SENSITIVE PERSONNEL DATA.” Do not publicize any further.
        5.16.4.2. The AFOSI will make a determination as to criminal intent and determine whether they
        will conduct the investigation. If the AFOSI detachment declines to investigate, prepare a memo
        indicating the AFOSI’s declination to investigate. Include the date and name of the agent making
        the declination.
     5.16.5. If the AFOSI declines to investigate, the IO will:
        5.16.5.1. Conduct a formal investigation (not an inquiry) using Commander-Directed Investiga-
        tion (CDI) Guide found at https://www.ig.hq.af.mil/igq/Downloads/CDIGuide.doc .
        5.16.5.2. Review this instruction before beginning the investigation and coordinate findings with
        the AFOSI before submitting a final report. As a minimum, documentation will include: oral tes-
        timony or written statements from subjects unless they have asserted their right to counsel and/or
        right to remain silent under Article 31, UCMJ, witnesses, and experts; a written summary of testi-
        mony; and written record of findings and recommendations. Note: The IO must determine
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                              45


      whether or not subjects or witnesses are represented by counsel prior to questioning. If so, all com-
      munications must be made with the counsel, rather than directly with the subject or witness.
   5.16.6. The FSS Commander monitors the progress of the investigation with the goal of completing it
   within 60 days from the date of the incident. The FSS Commander tracks the suspense and keeps HQ
   AFPC Test Management Office informed of the current status.
   5.16.7. Treat documents that allegedly compromise actual test material as CTM until proven other-
   wise by an official analysis. Since such documents are also evidence, they must receive special han-
   dling as government evidence. Investigating officers must consult with the AFOSI and SJA before
   seizing documents. Forward suspected test materials to HQ AFPC Test Management Office for anal-
   ysis. Follow the procedures used for packaging CTM as explained in Chapter 4 of this AFI. Testing
   officials at Randolph Air Force Base (AFB) perform test compromise analyses (allow 8 weeks for
   completion). Test materials analysis for official use by other than testing officials at Randolph AFB is
   not authorized.
   5.16.8. Once the report has undergone local legal review, the IO prepares the final investigation report
   in an original and two copies: One for the installation commander and one for HQ AFPC Test Man-
   agement Office. The installation commander transmits the report to the appropriate court-martial con-
   vening authority (if other than the installation commander) with the following information:
      5.16.8.1. A statement of the extent of the compromise.
      5.16.8.2. Corrective actions, including administrative or disciplinary action, taken against the
      offenders.
      5.16.8.3. Actions to prevent recurrence. Note: Do not include any copies of the actual CTM in the
      final report unless the entire report is identified as CTM and handled as such. Identify all other
      reports as FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (TEST CONTROL PERSONNEL). However, if reports
      contain classified information, follow the procedures in AFI 31-401.
   5.16.9. The special court-martial convening authority indorses and forwards the completed report to
   the HQ AFPC Test Management Office. In certain instances the HQ AFPC Test Management Office
   may consult with the AFPC Legal Office prior to closing / reopening the case.
   5.16.10. If the investigation is not completed within the recommended 60 days, the investigating
   officer prepares an interim report stating a) reasons the report is not completed, b) action investigating
   officer is taking to complete the report, and c) estimated date the completed report will be sent to HQ
   AFPC Test Management Office. The new suspense must not exceed 30 days from original suspense.
   Note: In some instances, the AFOSI may conduct a test compromise investigation without informing
   the TCO. When this happens, the AFOSI will notify HQ AFPC Test Management Office in accor-
   dance with applicable AFOSI directives, and the normal reporting and processing requirements in
   paragraph 5.16. are waived.

5.17. Guidelines for Research and Development (R&D) Test Materials:
   5.17.1. Any test, subtest, or test item that may be used in an operational Air Force test must be treated
   as CTM, regardless of the R&D stage. Conversely, any item not controlled at all stages of develop-
   ment must not be used in an Air Force test; a substitute or parallel item must be used instead. A test,
   subtest, or test item that has not been controlled at all stages of development must not be used in either
   the same or a parallel form.
46                                                                      AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008


     5.17.2. Appropriate limited release of R&D test material is encouraged to aid test development and
     permit legitimate scientific discourse. Limited release includes release of test material or data to a
     contractor, university, research agency, governmental agency, oversight panel, etc., to promote either
     development of a specific test or scientific discourse related to the test. In all cases, there should be
     clear benefit to the Air Force and a strictly worded Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to preclude
     further dissemination of the test materials. The MOA should include security arrangements and prohi-
     bitions against further release of the materials in whole, in part, or by incorporation in “spin-off” or
     parallel versions of the test. All requests for limited release must be forwarded, with a copy of the
     signed MOA, to HQ USAF/A1PF for approval before a test can be released.
     5.17.3. Open release of R&D test materials will (in foreseeable circumstances) preclude use of those
     materials (or a parallel form) on an operational Air Force test. Open release (without strict controls)
     includes release or sale of the test or any part of the test to: 1) a non-Air Force agency or individual, 2)
     Air Force external publication of the test or any part of the test, or 3) presentation of the test or any
     part of the test at scientific or other meetings, etc. Any R&D test that has been open-released will not
     be used operationally. This is true whether the R&D test was open-released in whole, in part (down to
     single item level), or in a parallel form. The exception to this rule is a test for which a parallel form has
     been previously released, but for which the test developer provides evidence of low transfer and low
     retest gains.

5.18. Prescribed Forms. AF Form 1566, WAPS Test Verification and AF Form 1780, AF Form 1780,
Request to Establish/Change Foreign Language Designated Position or Language Capability Position.

5.19. Adopted Forms. AF Form 310, Document Receipt and Destruction Certificate; AF Form 422,
Physical Profile Serial Report; AETC Form 1319, Personal Interview Record; USMEPCOM Form

Terms
Air Force Personnel Test—This includes all tests listed in the AFPT Catalog and this instruction. It
includes, but is not limited to, the following tests: AFOQT, SKT, PFE, DLRPT, USAFSE, and AFRAT.
Not included are tests such as PME tests, CDC volume review exams, end-of-course exams, and technical
training course exams.
Actual Test Material—Includes, but is not limited to, the exact questions or reproduced copies of the
exact questions which appear on any AFPT listed in AFPT Catalog and this instruction; the exact scoring
keys or reproduced copies of the exact scoring keys for AFPTs listed in AFPT Catalog and this
instruction; any materials used in the construction of those tests (outlines, scratch paper, etc.); any other
material which reflects actual test questions or answers; and any other material which sufficiently
54                                                                  AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008


captures test questions or answers (as determined by official analysis). This does not include materials
developed from an examinee's memory intended for personal use only.
Commercial Study Guide—Any commercial product that is designed with the intent to aid examinees or
potential examinees in preparing for a specific AFPT. Refer to Chapter 5 for rules concerning the use of
these products.
Controlled Test Material—A designation for information that is known or believed to contain actual test
material. CONTROLLED TEST MATERIAL information must be safeguarded from unauthorized
disclosure as outlined in Chapter 5.
Examinee—An individual who has taken a specific AFPT at any time in the past or is in the process of
taking a specific AFPT. For example, an individual who has taken the PFE or is in the testing room taking
the PFE is considered a PFE examinee. However, an individual who has taken the AFOQT is not
considered a PFE examinee because they are different AFPTs.
Group Study—An examinee or potential examinee discussing or sharing, in any form, information about
actual test material or marked or highlighted testable material with other examinees, potential examinees,
or other unauthorized individuals for the purpose of improving test scores or to aid in studying for an
AFPT.
Illegal Study Material—Highlighted or marked study materials such as AFPAM 36-2241V1, AFPAM
36-2241V2, CDCs, or notes that are shared with another examinee, potential examinee, or any other
unauthorized individual to aid in studying for an AFPT.
Knowledge—Knowledge by an individual of controlled or contraband nature of any particular
document(s) or material(s) means actual knowledge. Such knowledge may be inferred from the
surrounding circumstance of a compromise, but the drawing of such an inference is not required. It’s not
necessary that an individual was aware of the exact identity of the contraband or controlled document(s)
or material(s). The knowledge requirement is satisfied if the individual knew or should have known the
substance of such document(s) or material(s) was prohibited. This knowledge element may be satisfied if
(a) an individual did not know for sure the document(s) or material(s) were of a controlled or contraband
nature; (b) the individual was aware there was a high probability the document(s) or material(s) were of a
controlled or contraband nature, and (c) the individual deliberately and consciously tried to avoid learning
that, in fact, the document(s) or material(s) were of a controlled or contraband nature. Such deliberate
avoidance of positive knowledge is the equivalent of knowledge. In other words, the required knowledge
is satisfied if the individual had actual knowledge of the controlled or contraband nature of the
document(s) or material(s) or deliberately avoided that knowledge.
Potential Examinee—Certain individuals who may be administered a specific AFPT in the reasonably
foreseeable future. For example, civilians and airmen may take the AFOQT and are therefore potential
examinees for the AFOQT. In addition, an enlisted airman who may become eligible to take promotion
tests is considered a potential examinee for those tests.
Pretest—Similar to a practice or sample test which includes, but is not limited to, any written or oral
material in any question and answer format (multiple choice, fill in the blank, matching, essay, etc.).
According to Chapter 5 of this instruction, pretests only compromise actual test material when they are
shared between, used, or observed by more than one examinee or potential examinee or any unauthorized
individual.
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                           55


Suspected Test Material—Any material that is believed by authorities (i.e., AFOSI, TCO, TE,
investigating officers) to contain actual test material. This suspected test material includes, but is not
limited to, actual test material; shared, marked, or highlighted testable material; and test ponies.
Testable Material—Includes, but is not limited to, AFPAM 36-2241, Professional Development Guide,
commercial study guides developed by an authorized source, CDCs, AFIs, documentary material
produced and distributed through official channels, and personal study material. According to Chapter 5
of this instruction, testable material only compromises actual test material when it is shared between,
used, or observed by more than one examinee or potential examinee or any unauthorized individual with
the intent of improving test scores or to aid in studying for an AFPT. This includes any documents,
electronic media, or notes containing information from promotion test study references listed in the WAPS
Catalog.
Testing Administration Period—The date and time allotted for examinees to take AFPTs.

                       AIR FORCE OFFICER QUALIFYING TEST (AFOQT)

A2.1. Purpose. The AFOQT is used to help select candidates for officer commissioning programs and to
classify commissioned officers into utilization specialties such as pilot, navigator, or technical.

A2.2. Description. The AFOQT is available in two versions. Each version consists of 12 subtests. Sub-
tests are used to compute one or more of the five aptitude composites. Scores on the subtests relate to per-
formance in certain types of training. AFOQT composite scores are reported in percentiles. Percentile
scores range from 1 to 99 and reflect the ranking of each examinee on that composite compared to scores
in a test validation reference group. For example, an AFOQT verbal composite score of 56 places the
examinee equal to or higher than 56 percent and lower than 43 percent of other examinees.

A2.3. Personnel Tested. Applicants for any officer training program (except USAFA) and all applicants
for pilot training are required to take the AFOQT. Allow about 3 1/2 hours to administer the AFOQT and
give the entire test to all examinees.

A2.4. Administering the AFOQT. Administer the AFOQT according to AFPT 983, AFOQT Manual
for Administration. Normally, only administer the AFOQT to those individuals your unit directly sup-
ports. Make arrangements to obtain the applicant's scores if the AFOQT was administered at another loca-
tion.
     A2.4.1. Even if an examinee is not applying for pilot or navigator training, ensure examinees are
     administered the entire 12 subtests. There may be a future requirement for use of all subtest scores.
     Examinees will not be authorized an additional test administration at a later time because they failed
     to complete some subtests.
     A2.4.2. When TCOs or TEs are eligible to apply for entry into a commissioning program they must
     take the test and have their scores and test date recorded in their permanent records. If the TCO or TE
     has never taken the AFOQT and declines to take it at the time of appointment, he or she must sign a
     disclaimer memorandum stating the following: "I understand that while I have access to the AFOQT,
     I will not be authorized to take the AFOQT for application to a commissioning program or for any
     other program which requires official AFOQT scores. I understand this prohibition will remain in
     effect until 6 months after my last access to any AFOQT CONTROLLED TEST MATERIAL."
        A2.4.2.1. Include the SSN, date, and TCO account number in the disclaimer. A witness must also
        sign it. File the original copy of the disclaimer in the individual's records and provide a copy to
        HQ AFPC Test Management Office.
        A2.4.2.2. TCOs and TEs ineligible to apply for commissioning programs do not need to take the
        test or sign a disclaimer.

A2.5. Scoring the AFOQT. All AFOQT answer sheets are centrally scored at HQ AFPC Test Manage-
ment Office. Results are posted to the HQ AFPC Test Management Office website within 1 week of
receipt of answer sheets from the testing facility.

A2.6. Retesting:
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                               57


   A2.6.1. Conditions for Retests. Do not administer a retest until at least 180 days have passed from the
   date the AFOQT was previously administered. Advise applicants to consider retests only when scores
   achieved on the last test are unobtainable, incomplete, or not indicative of their current skills and abil-
   ities (in the opinion of the recruiting official or commander). Give the alternate form and version when
   possible.
   A2.6.2. Only two test administrations are authorized.
   A2.6.3. Applicants who desire to retest within the 180 day period must send justification to the HQ
   AFPC Test Management Office for approval. Exception: HQ AFROTC/RRFP may approve waivers
   after 150 days have elapsed in those instances where an applicant inadvertently retested prior to the
   required 180 days.

A2.7. Longevity of Scores. AFOQT scores do not expire. Scores from the first and second administra-
tions have proven to be the most predictive of success in officer training and commissioning programs.
Scores from the most recent test are used as the scores of record. Earlier test scores are no longer valid and
may not be used for official purposes. No waivers will be granted. In addition, scores from different forms
or administrations of the AFOQT may not be combined.

A2.8. Distributing and Recording AFOQT Scores. Scores may be accessed on the HQ AFPC website,
https://www.ask.afpc.randolph.af.mil/afoqts/default.asp. To obtain scores from HQ AFPC, call TOLL
FREE: 1(800) 616-3775, COMM: (210) 565-5000, DSN: 665-5000, Overseas Callers: Dial a toll-free
AT&T Direct Access Number from the country you are in, then 800-616-3775. AT&T Direct access num-
bers can be obtained from http://www.business.att.com/bt/dial_guide.jsp

A2.9. Using Scores. Each accession source directs the use of scores for applicants and selectees. For
pilot training applicants, the AFOQT score of record will be used in computing the PCSM score.

A2.10. Disposition of Completed Answer Sheets. Package all answer sheets as specified in this
instruction and mail certified or commercially available carrier according to Table 3.1. Include a transmit-
tal memorandum or AFOQT Worksheet (AFPT 238) with examinees' names, SSNs, and other required
entries.

A2.11. If an examinee has evidence indicating a scoring error occurred, he or she should forward this evi-
dence with a request for verification to HQ AFPC Test Management Office. An examinee's request for
verification of test scores will only be considered when there is substantial evidence a scoring error may
have occurred. Requests based solely on an individual’s belief that test scores do not properly reflect apti-
tude will be disapproved.
58                                                                  AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008


                                              Attachment 3

                           TEST FOR BASIC AVIATION SKILLS (TBAS)

A3.1. Purpose. The Test for Basic Aviation Skills (TBAS) measures certain cognitive, multi-tasking,
and psychomotor attributes predictive of success in Air Force pilot training programs. A pilot candidate’s
Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) score and Federal Aviation Administration certified flying
hours are combined with the TBAS measurements to formulate a Pilot Candidate Selection Method
(PCSM) score. Pilot selection boards receive each candidate’s PCSM composite score on a percentile
scale of 1 to 99. PCSM assists pilot selection boards to select candidates most likely to successfully com-
plete undergraduate pilot training with the help of TBAS component measurements.

A3.2. Description. The TBAS is a battery of subtests administered on a computer test station. Examinees
are required to respond to computerized tasks using a keypad, joysticks, and foot pedals. The TBAS
includes subtests measuring psychomotor coordination, cognitive abilities, and multi-tasking capabilities.

A3.3. Personnel Tested. Test all applicants for any AETC Air Force pilot training program.

A3.4. Administering the TBAS. Administer the TBAS according to procedures specified by the TBAS
Operator’s Manual, HQ AFPC/DPSOE, and the PCSM Program Office. Allow approximately 60 minutes
for TBAS administration. Give all examinees the entire battery. Do not allow test proctors to administer
the TBAS or oversee its administration. When TCOs or TEs are eligible to apply for entry into a commis-
sioning program they must take the TBAS and have their scores and test date recorded in their permanent
records. If the TCO or TE has never taken the TBAS and declines to take it at the time of appointment, he
or she must sign a disclaimer memorandum stating the following: "I understand that I will not be autho-
rized to take the TBAS for application to any program which requires official TBAS scores. I understand
this prohibition will remain in effect permanently."
     A3.4.1. Include the SSN, date, and TCO account number in the disclaimer. A witness must also sign
     it. File the original copy of the disclaimer in the individual's records and provide a copy to HQ AFPC
     Test Management Office.
     A3.4.2. TCOs and TEs ineligible to apply for any flying training programs do not need to take the test
     or sign a statement.

A3.5. Scoring the TBAS. Transmit TBAS data by e-mail to the TBAS Program Office for scoring. The
PCSM Program Office’s Test Processing Station will combine a candidate’s TBAS data, AFOQT score,
and flying hours to compute the overall PCSM composite score.

A3.6. Updating Flying Hours. To update flying hours, candidates must submit their requests to the
PCSM Program Office via e-mail to pcsm.admin@randolph.af.mil, fax at DSN 487-4914 or COM
(210) 652-4914, or mail to 151 J Street East, Suite 2 Randolph AFB 78150. Be sure to include all validat-
ing documentation with the candidate’s request at least 7 calendar days before their board suspense date.

A3.7. Retesting. Only two TBAS test administrations are authorized. Do not administer a retest (second
test administration) until at least 180 days have passed since the first administration. No additional admin-
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                        59


istrations will be allowed. TBAS scores remain valid indefinitely. TCOs and TEs must inform all examin-
ees that only two administrations of the TBAS are authorized.

A3.8. Distributing and Recording PCSM Scores. PCSM scores are available on the internet at https://
pcsm.aetc.af.mil. Scores can also be obtained from the PCSM Program Office; AETC/SAS; by calling
DSN 487-4529 or 1-877-247-5607.

A3.9. Using Scores. Each accession source directs the use of PCSM scores for pilot training applicants.
HQ AETC/CC has declared that the PCSM score will be used in the pilot selection process, but has not
mandated a specific weighting. TBAS-based PCSM scores are required for all pilot selection boards
meeting.

COMPUTERIZED ADAPTIVE SCREENING TEST (CAST) AND ENLISTMENT SCREENING
                             TEST (EST)

A4.1. Purpose. The CAST and EST are optional tests administered at the discretion of a recruiter to
screen potential enlistees. Scores are predictive of performance on the ASVAB and Armed Forces Quali-
fication Test (AFQT).

A4.2. Description. There is one version of the CAST and two versions of the EST. Each test version
measures verbal and mathematical abilities. For the CAST, the computer software automatically calcu-
lates scores. For the EST, the raw score is the total number of questions answered correctly from both
parts of the test. That score is then compared to a probability table that provides expected scores on the
ASVAB and AFQT. The CAST and EST are designated as "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY."

A4.3. Personnel Tested. The CAST or EST may be administered to all non-prior service applicants for
enlistment into the active force, ANG, and AFRC.

A4.4. Administering the CAST and EST. The majority of CAST and EST administrations occur at Air
Force recruiting offices; however, ANG and AFRC TCOs may also administer the EST. The CAST takes
15 to 35 minutes to administer. Allow about 45 minutes to administer the EST. Refer to the AFPT Catalog
for all materials needed to administer and score the EST and CAST.

A4.5. Retesting. TCOs must wait at least 30 days between administrations and allow only two retests
within a 12-month period. Administer the alternate form.

A4.6. Recording CAST and EST Scores. Recruiting personnel record scores on AETC Form 1319,
Personal Interview Record. Include the test form administered, date of test, and raw score.

A4.7. Disposing of Completed Answer Sheets. Refer to Table 3.1., Rule 11. Destroy answer sheets
after 6 months following the procedures in paragraph 4.3.
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                             61

              ARMED SERVICES VOCATIONAL APTITUDE BATTERY (ASVAB)

A5.1. Purpose. The ASVAB evaluates specific aptitude areas and provides a percentile score related to
requirements for selecting and classifying individuals for the Armed Services. There are two ASVAB test-
ing programs--Student and Enlistment. The Student Testing Program applies to ASVAB testing in educa-
tional institutions such as high schools and vocational trade schools. The Enlistment Testing Program
applies to ASVAB testing in authorized accessions testing facilities such as military entrance processing
stations (MEPS) and mobile examining teams (MET). The Army is the executive agent for the overall
ASVAB Testing Program. The Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) is the executive agent for
ASVAB research and development.

A5.2. Description. Four composite scores are computed for the ASVAB: Mechanical (M), Administra-
tive (A), General (G), and Electronics (E) (MAGE). These scores are predictive of training success in a
variety of military occupations.

A5.3. Personnel Tested. Administer the ASVAB to all prior and non-prior service applicants for enlist-
ment into the active Air Force, ANG, and AFRC.

A5.4. Ordering Materials. Only overseas active duty TCOs and TEs authorized to administer the
ASVAB may order the materials listed in the AFPT Catalog.

A5.5. Administering the ASVAB:
   A5.5.1. Student Testing Program. MEPS personnel administer and control student versions of the
   ASVAB. MEPCOM assigns school teachers or school officials to assist in administering and proctor-
   ing ASVAB testing sessions. Responsibilities for student testing in DoD schools overseas are assigned
   regionally to the recruiting services of the Armed Forces. In England and Spain Military Testing
   Facility TCOs and TEs assist AFRS by administering student versions of the ASVAB in DoD schools
   as requested, scheduled, and coordinated by Air Force recruiters. Military Testing Facility TCOs and
   TEs control the student version of the ASVAB used for overseas testing.
   A5.5.2. Enlistment Testing Program. MEPSs and METs conduct enlistment testing for active duty
   requirements. At overseas locations, Military Testing Facility TCOs and TEs administer and control
   enlistment versions of the ASVAB. Ensure USMEPCOM, Request for Examination, is completed
   and signed before testing.

A5.6. Retesting. All procedures apply to both student and enlistment ASVAB administrations.
   A5.6.1. Applicants should be given a retest only to verify scores that do not appear to reflect an appli-
   cant's true ability.
   A5.6.2. Applicants must never be retested just so the individual can increase aptitude area scores to
   meet standards prescribed for enlistment options or programs. However, recruits in Basic Military
   Training may be re-administered the ASVAB for refining or changing classification decisions.

     A5.6.3. Administer the ASVAB in its entirety. Give the first retest at least 30 days after the initial test.
     Give the second retest at least 30 days after the first retest. Always use an alternate form for a retest.
     Give subsequent retests after a 6 month waiting period.
     A5.6.4. Process requests for waivers to ASVAB retesting policy through the recruiting squadron via
     HQ AFRS/RSOP to HQ USAF/A1PF. Only HQ USAF/A1PF has authority to approve waivers.

A5.7. Recording ASVAB Scores. Hand-score answer sheets and record scores on a computer-generated
listing. Send the original worksheet, together with the answer sheets and USMEPCOM Form 680-3A-E,
to the address indicated in Table 3.1. Give copy two to the recruiter and maintain copy three at the Mili-
tary Testing Facility.

A5.8. Using Scores:
     A5.8.1. Enlistment. Refer to AFI 36-2002, Regular Air Force and Special Category Accessions, for
     using ASVAB scores and AFQT scores required to select applicants for enlistment in the active Air
     Force and AFRC. For ANG enlistment, refer to ANGI 36-2002, Enlistment and Reenlistment in the
     ANG and as a Reserve of the Air Force, for using ASVAB scores to select applicants without prior
     ANG service.
     A5.8.2. Classification and Assignment. Refer to AFECD for using ASVAB scores in the classifica-
     tion and assignment of airmen.

A5.9. Disposing of Completed Answer Sheets. Use Table 3.1. for instructions on how and where to
mail answer sheets based on test administration location.

                       ARMED FORCES CLASSIFICATION TEST (AFCT)

A6.1. Purpose. The AFCT evaluates airmen in the same four aptitude areas as the ASVAB (i.e., the
MAGE composites). These aptitude areas relate to training success in particular groups of AFSs. Mini-
mum scores are required for entry into certain AFSs that indicate the likelihood of training success in the
AFS.

A6.2. Description. The MAGE aptitude composites produced are parallel in content and meaning to
those of the ASVAB.

A6.3. Administering the AFCT. Allow about 4 hours to administer the AFCT. Refer to the AFPT Cata-
log for necessary materials. (Note: The ASVAB title is referenced throughout the material but should
have been updated with pen-and-ink changes to AFCT.)

A6.4. Personnel Tested. TEs may administer the AFCT to officers who plan to enlist after separation.
They may also give it to airmen in the Regular Air Force, ANG, or AFRC when one of the following con-
ditions exists:
   A6.4.1. Records indicate current scores are incomplete or have been changed without authority.
   A6.4.2. Scores are not recorded in the personnel data system.
   A6.4.3. Commander determines current scores may not be indicative of the airman's abilities. This
   could be based on discrepancies between the airman's performance and the current scores, or addi-
   tional training or experience that could improve the individual's scores.
   A6.4.4. Current scores restrict them from applying for retraining into another career field or for a spe-
   cial duty assignment.

A6.5. Retesting. Wait at least 6 months from the last test before administering a retest. Use an alternate
version. If an examinee wants to retest within 6 months from the last test, advise him or her to submit a
request through the TCO to HQ AFPC Test Management Office

A6.6. Recording AFCT Scores. The TCO or TE documents the scores and date of test. File a copy
locally and provide a copy to the airman. Update the personnel data system with the most recent scores.
Never combine scores from different forms or administrations of the AFCT or ASVAB.
NOTE: Only the most recent scores count as the official scores of record regardless of the outcome when
compared to earlier test attempts.

A6.7. Disposing of Completed Answer Sheets. Refer to Table 3.1. Destroy answer sheets according to
paragraph 4.3.

                       DEFENSE LANGUAGE APTITUDE BATTERY (DLAB)

A7.1. Purpose. The DLAB evaluates potential ability to complete formal foreign language training. It is
used to screen and select foreign language trainees.

A7.2. Description. The DLAB is a multiple-choice test administered primarily by compact disc.

A7.3. Personnel Tested. The TCO or TE gives the DLAB to:
     A7.3.1. Officers and airmen who are candidates for foreign language training conducted by the
     Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center (DLIFLC).
     A7.3.2. Officers being considered for special assignments requiring foreign language skills. Do not
     give the DLAB to those who have already achieved reading and listening proficiency (at least R-3,
     L-3) in the language required for the proposed assignment.
     A7.3.3. Line Colonel-selects within 120 days of notification of promotion selection. Do not test colo-
     nel-selects if they already have DLAB scores on record. Line Colonel-selects must contact the Mili-
     tary Testing Facility to schedule testing.
     A7.3.4. DoD civilians who need to meet special duty requirements.
     A7.3.5. Family members of military personnel and civilians who need to meet special duty assign-
     ment criteria.

A7.4. Administering the DLAB. Allow about 85 minutes to administer the DLAB. Use headsets. Refer
to the AFPT Catalog for necessary materials.

A7.5. Retesting.
     A7.5.1. Wait at least 6 months from the previous test before administering a retest. If an examinee
     wants to retest sooner, advise him or her to submit a request through the TCO to HQ AFPC Test Man-
     agement Office. Qualifying scores on the DLAB are valid indefinitely.
     A7.5.2. Waivers. Only two test administrations are authorized.

A7.6. Recording DLAB Scores. Report as converted scores by memorandum. File a copy locally and
provide a copy to the individual. Also update the most current scores in the personnel data system.

A7.7. Disposing of Completed Answer Sheets. Forward answer sheets to DLIFLC monthly. Refer to
Table 3.1. for details.

                        ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING TEST (EDPT)

A8.1. Purpose. The EDPT evaluates the basic ability to complete formal courses for programming elec-
tronic data processing equipment. It is used to screen and select airmen for career fields requiring this
ability.

A8.2. Description. The EDPT is a multiple-choice test. It contains measures of verbal ability, symbolic
reasoning, and arithmetic reasoning.

A8.3. Personnel Tested. The TCO or TE gives the EDPT to airmen applying for career fields with an
EDPT requirement as specified in AFECD either on initial assignment or retraining.

A8.4. Administering the EDPT. Allow about 90 minutes to administer the EDPT. Refer to AFPT Cata-
log for necessary materials.

A8.5. Retesting. Wait at least 6 months from the previous test before administering a retest.

A8.6. Recording EDPT Scores. Report as raw scores by memorandum. File a copy locally and provide
a copy to the individual. Also update scores in the personnel data system. Refer to AFECD for minimum
scores.

A8.7. Disposing of EDPT Answer Sheets. Refer to Table 3.1. Destroy according to paragraph 4.3.

                                   AIR FORCE PROMOTION TESTS

A9.1. Promotion Testing Program (Includes administration of SKTs, PFEs, and USAFSEs). These
tests measure airmen's specialty and general military knowledge and produce test scores used in conjunc-
tion with other criteria for promotion. PFE and SKT scores are used in a weighted-factor promotion sys-
tem to promote airmen to staff sergeant through master sergeant. The USAFSE score is used in a
combination of weighted and board scores for promotion to senior and chief master sergeant. Scores
achieved on promotion tests contribute to each person's total score used in promotion selection.

A9.2. What Promotion Tests Measure. The PFE measures airmen’s broad knowledge of the military.
The SKT measures their specialty knowledge. The USAFSE measures knowledge of supervisory and
managerial responsibilities required and desired of senior NCOs.

A9.3. Description of Promotion Tests:
     A9.3.1. SKT, PFE, and USAFSE: 100-item, multiple-choice tests, each taking approximately 2 hours
     to administer, including instructions.
        A9.3.1.1. SKT. Measures airmen's knowledge of their career field. Topics covered in SKTs are
        normally limited to those contained in the CFETP for each AFS. References to support the SKT
        are normally CDCs or other publications listed as technical references on the CFETP. Publications
        used as SKT references must be available Air Force-wide. All study references used to support
        SKT development are listed in the WAPS Catalog. The WAPS Catalog is revised annually, pub-
        lished in August, and available via the AFOMS web page.
        A9.3.1.2. PFE. Measures general military and supervisory knowledge. Test content is based on
        information in AFPAM 36-2241.
        A9.3.1.3. USAFSE. Measures military, supervisory, and managerial knowledge. Test content is
        based on information in AFPAM 36-2241.

A9.4. Promotion Test Development. AFOMS develops all promotion tests and associated materials,
using the following minimum guidelines:
     A9.4.1. Senior NCO SMEs with practical field experience determine the content of the SKT. They
     use the CFETP, occupational analysis data, and their own experience to clearly tie test content to per-
     formance of important tasks in the specialty.
     A9.4.2. SMEs write test questions using standards and guidelines in the AFOMS Test Construction
     Handbook maintained by AFOMS and approved by HQ AFPC Force Management Liaison Office. All
     test questions are developed to the appropriate skill and grade level being tested using standard, direct,
     and concise language.

A9.5. Personnel Tested. The personnel data system produces a list of airmen eligible for testing before
each testing cycle. The TE schedules every airman on this list for testing unless he / she is ineligible or
unable to test for medical reasons (see paragraph A9.11.3.). Always administer the current revision.
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                          67


   A9.5.1. SKTs. Administer the SKT to all airmen eligible for and desiring promotion consideration to
   the grades of staff, technical, or master sergeant. Administer the SKT for the AFSC in which airmen
   are competing for promotion. Refer to the current WAPS Testing Requirements List for specific SKT
   exemptions. Refer to AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion Program, for additional information on SKT
   exemptions.
   A9.5.2. USAFSEs. Give the USAFSE to all airmen eligible for and desiring promotion consideration
   to the grades of senior or chief master sergeant.

A9.6. Selection of SMEs for Test Development. For USAFSE and PFE test development projects, HQ
AFPC Test Management Office, in conjunction with AFOMS, announces nomination procedures by
memorandum approximately 120 days before each project date. For SKTs, projected SME requirements
are listed in the TPD 2 years in advance of the project date. The following procedures are used to select
SMEs for test development projects:
   A9.6.1. HQ AFPC Test Management Office Actions. CMSgts or CMSgt selectees write the USAF-
   SEs. SMSgt selectees and above write the PFEs. SME selection will be optimized to ensure maximum
   AFS participation across test development projects. For SKTs, AFOMS will select MSgt selectees or
   above who are technical experts in their specialty. SKT SME selections are coordinated with the
   MAJCOM functional manager to select the most capable airmen. SMEs will be selected to optimize
   maximum MAJCOM representation and participation in the test development process across test
   development projects. Additionally, installations will perform the following actions in support of
   SME selection:
       A9.6.1.1. Adhere to required timelines as specified in the TPD.
       A9.6.1.2. Request SME release from levies in writing to AFOMS SME Liaison Office as soon as
       possible with justification so that rapid relevy action can be taken if necessary. Request SME
       release only for extreme or unforeseen circumstances.
       A9.6.1.3. Advise the unit levied that AFOMS will fund the TDY.
       A9.6.1.4. Comply with the TPD for nomination and special experience requirements of SMEs.
   A9.6.2. Unit Commanders. Personally interview each nominee to ensure he / she meets the following
   requirements: (the commander’s support staff will provide the unit commander with a list of the
   requirements listed below before the interview.)
       A9.6.2.1. For SKTs, SMEs must:
           A9.6.2.1.1. Hold the enlisted rank of MSgt selectee or higher (MSgts are preferred).
           A9.6.2.1.2. Possess the 7-skill level for and work in the AFS for which they are scheduled to
           write tests. NCOs who possess the 9-skill level may be selected if they have advanced from the
           career ladder for which the tests are being developed.
           A9.6.2.1.3. Be familiar with the major types of equipment and duties in the specialty, have
           extensive background in the career field (including technical training where appropriate
           courses are available), and have working knowledge of primary reference material in the
           career field.
           A9.6.2.1.4. Have good verbal and writing abilities.
68                                                                    AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008


            A9.6.2.1.5. Have no personal or family problems or future TDY requirements that would
            interfere with availability for the entire TDY.
            A9.6.2.1.6. Have no spouse or immediate family member (defined as children, stepchildren,
            and siblings) in the Air Force below the grade of MSgt in the same career field or family mem-
            ber married to someone below the grade of MSgt in the same career field.
        A9.6.2.2. For PFEs and USAFSEs. HQ AFPC Test Management Office will provide SME
        requirements with the nomination procedures referred to in paragraph A9.6. Unit commanders
        will ensure each selectee meets the requirements specified by HQ AFPC Test Management Office.
        A9.6.2.3. For all promotion tests. Unit commanders will advise SMEs they are responsible to
        AFOMS for their test-writing duties before, during, and after their test-development TDY. If
        SMEs have any test-related concerns after their test project, they will be addressed to only
        AFOMS or HQ AFPC Test Management Office. AFOMS will provide an approved description of
        test-writing duties to be used in the trip report. The trip report will not contain any additional test
        development information unless approved by AFOMS. If any concerns arise that are not satisfac-
        torily resolved by AFOMS or HQ AFPC Test Management Office, they will only be elevated
        through IG channels.
     A9.6.3. MPFs / Units. Upon receipt of the by-name levy or at least 4 weeks before the reporting date,
     provide the name, grade, duty telephone, and home mailing address of selected SMEs to the AFOMS
     SME Liaison Office. Prepare and send one copy of the TDY orders to AFOMS/TEAL, 1550 5th Street
     East, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4449 at least 2 weeks before the reporting date. Advise selected
     SMEs to contact the AFOMS SME Liaison Office at DSN 487-5235, extension 3063, if they have any
     questions about their TDY. This is particularly important for those personnel who receive short notice
     (less than 2 weeks) of their selection.

A9.7. Obtaining WAPS Reference Material:
     A9.7.1. Before the WAPS testing cycle begins, HQ AFPC flows a request for CDC reference material
     to AFIADL for each airman eligible for promotion. AFIADL uses this information to automatically
     issue WAPS CDCs to each airman eligible for promotion who was not previously issued the required
     material. Refer to the current WAPS Catalog for specific procedures on requisitioning WAPS CDC
     materials.
     A9.7.2. Unit WAPS monitors order classified WAPS materials separately for unit airmen in Intelli-
     gence AFSCs. Refer to the current WAPS Catalog for specific procedures.
     A9.7.3. Unit WAPS monitors ensure all non-CDC reference material is available at base, unit, or
     functional level on at least a 2:7 ratio. Upon airman's request, order any required study reference not
     locally available. Any airman not receiving WAPS CDC study material must contact their unit WAPS
     monitor for resolution.

A9.8. Procuring Promotion Test Materials:
     A9.8.1. Before the start of each testing cycle, AFPC Test Management Office will determine the test
     booklets required for each TCO Account. The specific requirements, including quantity, for each
     booklet will be determined based on the personnel; data system. The list will be forwarded to AFOMS
     who will in turn provide the listing to AFOMS DAPS for shipment. For additional booklets, TCOs
     must place an order to AFPC. This order for additional books must include justification.
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                             69


   A9.8.2. On receipt of the tests, the TCO and TE must jointly verify the correct quantity, booklet num-
   bers, and types of tests received. The TCO will sign the receipt form and immediately return it to
   AFOMS.

A9.9. Maintaining the Required AFPT Revision. TCOs will maintain only test booklets for estab-
lished after-testing window requirements. All other PFE and USAFSE booklets must be destroyed. Tests
are valid from the day following the cycle Promotion Eligibility Cutoff Date (PECD) and expire on the
day of the next cycle PECD. For example: 08E6 tests will be valid from 1 Jan 08 through 31 Dec 08. Indi-
viduals that still require testing after the next cycle PECD are not authorized to take expired tests (see
paragraphs A9.11. and A9.12.). Contact HQ AFPC Test Management Office for guidance if this occurs.

A9.10. Scheduling Promotion Testing. TCOs and TEs will adhere to the following promotion testing
windows and schedule all promotion eligibles during the allocated testing window for each grade. When
examinee population exceeds the capacity to complete testing within the window without undue hardship
(overtime, accountability, shipment, odd shifts, etc.), send a request to extend the testing window to HQ
AFPC Test Management Office.


Cycle          Testing Window
SSgt           1 May - 15 Jun
TSgt           1 Feb - 31 Mar
MSgt           1 Feb - 31 Mar
SMSgt          First and second weeks of December
CMSgt          Second week of September

   A9.10.1. Airmen must be prepared to test on the first day of the testing administration window.
   A9.10.2. If an airman is present for any portion of the testing administration window, he / she must
   test prior to TDY/PCS departure.
   A9.10.3. Do not test an airman outside the established testing administration window. Note: Airmen
   may test prior to the start of a testing administration window provided the test booklets are available
   if they sign a statement indicating their election.
   A9.10.4. Schedule examinees to test as early as possible in each testing administration window
   (within facility and staff constraints) until all eligibles have been tested. Testing late in the testing
   administration window should be the exception.
   A9.10.5. Do not delay testing to give additional study time unless airmen did not have access to study
   reference materials at least 60 days before their test date. Airmen may request a delay in testing when
   study reference materials are not received provided they have initiated follow-up action in a timely
   manner (at least 60 days before start of the testing administration window). Note: 60 days study time
   refers to the minimum amount of time the airman must have access to study materials and not the time
   required for notification of the testing date.
   A9.10.6. Personnel Departing Permanent Change of Station (PCS). If you cannot test an airman
   before departing PCS (without temporary duty [TDY] en route), provide an AF Form 1566, WAPS
   Test Verification, with parts I and II completed or automated form 1566, Notification of WAPS Pro-
70                                                                     AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008


     motion Testing, to the gaining military testing facility. Note: Further references to Notification of
     WAPS Promotion Testing will be indicated by the number 1566. If the airman will be TDY (including
     TDY en route), the losing military testing facility sends the 1566 to the military testing facility servic-
     ing the TDY location for timely testing of the airman. In the case of TDY en route, the losing military
     testing facility must advise the gaining military testing facility of these actions.
     A9.10.7. Personnel Departing TDY. If the TDY period begins before the testing window starts and
     extends until after the testing window, test airmen at the TDY location if testing facilities are avail-
     able. Test airmen who cannot be tested prior to departure or at the TDY location as soon as possible
     upon their return.
     A9.10.8. Personnel Departing to Contingency Operations. TCOs and TEs will use the following pro-
     cedures for personnel who deploy to real-world contingency operations before their testing window
     begins.
        A9.10.8.1. Give all airmen who deploy at least 90 days in support of a contingency operation 60
        calendar days testing preparation time. The 60-day testing preparation time includes any leave,
        special pass, compensatory time off (CTO), and / or rest and recuperation (R&R) taken upon com-
        pletion of the contingency TDY. Airmen must ensure they receive the authorized preparation time.
        Those who test early waive their right to the full 60 days’ preparation time. Complete promotion
        testing 60 to 75 days after airmen return from deployment.
        A9.10.8.2. Give all airmen who deploy for less than 90 days in support of a contingency operation
        30 calendar days testing preparation time. The 30-day testing preparation time includes any leave,
        special pass, CTO, and / or R&R taken upon completion of the contingency TDY. Airmen must
        ensure they receive the authorized preparation time. Those who test early waive their right to the
        full 30 days’ preparation time. Complete promotion testing 30 to 45 days after airmen return from
        deployment.
        A9.10.8.3. Commander’s support staffs will advise Military Testing Facilities as soon as possible
        when an airman requiring testing is scheduled for deployment so that testing can be accomplished
        before departure.
     A9.10.9. Rescheduling must be kept to a minimum to preclude disruption of the testing window and
     ensure timely promotion consideration.
        A9.10.9.1. Do not reschedule airmen to accommodate normal leave unless the leave was
        approved by the supervisor or commander (leave web approval not required) prior to notification
        of airman’s test date.
        A9.10.9.2. Test date changes must only be made for documented family or medical emergencies
        and sick call.
        A9.10.9.3. Exercises and inspections are not justification for rescheduling test dates.
        A9.10.9.4. Do not reschedule test dates because an airman wants additional study time.
        A9.10.9.5. Requests to change scheduled test dates for reasons other than documented TDY, fam-
        ily or medical emergencies, medical conditions precluding testing (AF Form 422, Physical Profile
        Serial Report), or sick call must be submitted through the unit commander to the FSS Commander
        for approval. If there is a disagreement submit the schedule change to the installation commander
        for final disposition.
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                               71


A9.11. Testing after the Testing Window. Only test airmen after the testing window if they are late
gains, previously unidentified, deployed, medically excused, or TDY for the duration of the testing win-
dow. Tests are valid starting on the day following the cycle PECD and expire on the day of the next cycle
PECD (1 Jan for E6/7, 1 Apr for E5, 1 Aug for E9, and 1 Oct for E8). For example, 08E6 tests will be
valid from 1 Jan 08 through 31 Dec 08. Never administer an obsolete test for an airman authorized supple-
mental promotion consideration. Explain supplemental promotion procedures to the affected airmen
(refer to AFI 36-2502). When an airman is competing for promotion for more than one cycle, he or she
takes only the current version(s) of the test and the test results are applied retroactively to the applicable
cycle(s). Airmen authorized supplemental promotion consideration that do not have test scores for that
cycle use WAPS test scores from the first testing cycle following the supplemental promotion cycle for
which test scores are available.
   A9.11.1. The FSS Commander approves all testing after the testing window. Approval is not required
   for airmen returning from contingency operations. Note: Refer to paragraph A9.10.8. for testing win-
   dows.
   A9.11.2. Excuse airmen from testing during the appropriate testing window for medical reasons if
   they have an AF Form 422 from a military treatment facility. The AF Form 422 will indicate if the air-
   man is or is not medically able to study during this period. Schedule testing after the release date of the
   temporary restriction listed on the AF Form 422. If the condition still exists after that date, the airman
   must obtain a new AF Form 422. Counsel airmen that unless they were restricted from studying, they
   will be tested upon release with no additional study time allowed and must prepare accordingly. Give
   personnel who cannot study due to classified or restricted references 60 days’ study time upon medi-
   cal clearance. If notified in advance, provide an escort to those airmen with an AF Form 422 indicat-
   ing they may need a restroom break during testing. Enlisted escorts must be at least one grade level
   higher than the examinee.
   A9.11.3. Test patients assigned to medical facilities that have study references and are well enough to
   report to the military testing facility.
   A9.11.4. TCOs/TEs will maintain a current list of all nonweighable examinees for all cycles in the
   WAPS Information Retrieval System with documented reason for the delay and projected test date.
   Reason for delay in testing and projected test date must be updated in WIRE no later than 30 days
   after the end of the testing window. TCOs/TEs must track and verify all changes in status. Status must
   be reviewed and updated on a monthly basis.

A9.12. Supplemental Testing. Test airmen for supplemental promotion consideration according to the
individual test requirements provided by HQ AFPC Enlisted Promotions Management Office. Always
give the current revision. Tests are valid starting on the day following the cycle PECD and expire on the
first day of the next cycle PECD. For example, 08E6 tests will be valid from 1 Jan 08 through 31 Dec 08.
Never administer an obsolete test for supplemental promotion consideration.

A9.13. Testing Notification. TCOs/TEs must coordinate test dates with unit WAPS monitors and unit
commanders. The unit commander must notify and direct airmen to report for testing as scheduled. The
unit commander also advises airmen that failure to show or late arrival will render them ineligible for pro-
motion for that cycle except when rescheduling is approved (see A9.14.). The airman completes 1566.
The WAPS monitor returns the original to the TCO and gives a copy to the airman.

     A9.13.1. By signing the 1566, the airman is acknowledging receipt of the scheduled testing appoint-
     ment and verifying access to current WAPS study reference materials. If applicable, the airman also
     makes an election regarding an SKT exemption.
     A9.13.2. Airmen who decline promotion testing must complete the 1st endorsement, paragraph 2 of
     the 1566. All testing declinations must be done in the presence of and signed by a witness. The base
     or unit WAPS monitor counsels the airman that declining to test will make him or her ineligible for
     promotion for that cycle. Tell them refusal to test disqualifies them from receiving separation pay, if
     otherwise qualified for such pay.
     A9.13.3. Do not permit a person to withdraw a declination statement unless there are unusual human-
     itarian reasons. If fully justified, wing commanders or equivalent may approve the withdrawal of a
     declination statement for unusual circumstances or hardship reasons at any time. This authority may
     not be delegated. If promotion selections have been made, HQ AFPC Chief, Enlisted Promotions and
     Military Testing Branch is the approval authority for withdrawal of a declination statement.
     A9.13.4. If an airman elects not to complete the 1566, it constitutes refusal to test and renders the air-
     man ineligible for promotion for the current cycle. Exception: An airman is not rendered ineligible
     for refusal to complete 1566 because he or she does not have access to current WAPS study reference
     materials.

A9.14. No Shows.
     A9.14.1. Within 2 calendar days of a testing no-show, notify the unit commander in writing. The noti-
     fication letter must include: Airman’s name, grade, SSN, promotion cycle, and date of missed
     appointment.
     A9.14.2. The military testing function will suspense the airman’s CSS to return the notification letter
     within 5 calendar days. If the unit commander’s request for rescheduling is denied or the unit com-
     mander non-recommends rescheduling, update the personnel data system. Enter the promotion eligi-
     bility status (PES) code "P" with an effective date of the date the airman missed the scheduled test
     date. Forward the promotion testing RIP and a copy of the denial letter for filing in the airman’s Unit
     Personnel Record Group (UPRG).
     A9.14.3. The unit commander may request rescheduling of airmen who did not report for testing as
     specified on the 1566 if they are convinced the airman did everything in his or her power to make the
     appointment.
        A9.14.3.1. The FSS Commander is the approval authority for rescheduling. Rescheduling will not
        be authorized for reasons within the airman’s control. When the unit commander and FSS Com-
        mander are in disagreement as to whether the reason for failing to show for testing was within or
        not within the airman’s control, forward the case file to the host installation commander or equiv-
        alent who is the Special Court Martial Convening Authority for final disposition.
        A9.14.3.2. Do not allow scheduled personnel in the testing room after the starting time recorded
        on the 1566 . All examinees must be on time.

A9.15. No Valid Test Score. The following procedures apply when airmen have tested but do not have a
valid test score:
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                                73


   A9.15.1. Airman took wrong SKT. When an airman has taken the wrong SKT, schedule and adminis-
   ter the correct test as soon as possible after the error is found if the airman is notified within 15 calen-
   dar days of the faulty administration. If more than 15 days have elapsed, provide the airman additional
   study time (up to 30 days) before administering the correct test. Exception: If the airman was admin-
   istered an SKT for the wrong shredout of an AFSC, request testing instructions from. HQ AFPC
   Enlisted Promotions and Military Testing Branch. Regardless of the circumstances, forward all
   answer sheets with any answers marked to HQ AFPC Test Management Office. Annotate sheets
   "erroneously administered test." Do not destroy answer sheets (whether partially or fully completed)
   under any circumstances.
   A9.15.2. Test answer sheets inadvertently destroyed, lost in the mail, received in a condition that pre-
   vents scoring, or testing conditions that invalidate test administration: Airman will be required to
   retest. Under no circumstances may an airman retake the same test. Airman will be contacted by HQ
   AFPC Enlisted Promotions and Military Testing Branch concerning specific testing requirements.

A9.16. Preparing and Mailing Materials for Scoring:
   A9.16.1. Answer Sheets and Test Rosters. Review all answer sheets (AFPTs 851) and test rosters
   (AFPTs 237) for accuracy. See Table 3.1. for mailing procedures.
NOTE: TCOs/TEs are responsible for the accuracy of sections A through J of the AFPT 851 and must
verify that these sections are completed and bubbled in correctly.
   A9.16.2. Packaging and Mailing. TCOs and TEs may mail WAPS and USAFSE answer sheets
   together with separate rosters. Clearly mark the internal envelope with control log numbers for both
   accounts.
   A9.16.3. Include answer sheets for any promotion test given by mistake or approved for re-adminis-
   tration in regular WAPS or USAFSE packages under transmittal memorandums citing circumstances
   or authority for retesting.
   A9.16.4. Mail daily if possible but do not keep answer sheets longer than 7 calendar days. If you have
   an STCO, mail test materials within 7 calendar days of receipt from the STCO.
   A9.16.5. Package Control. Set up separate control logs for WAPS and USAFSE accounts at the
   beginning of each calendar year. Number packages sequentially beginning each year with 001. Do not
   skip sequence numbers or use these control logs for any other mailings (i.e. queries, other types of test
   answer sheets, etc.) If you have test answer sheets dated from the previous year but not mailed until
   January of the following year, number them from the previous year's log book. Indicate the last pack-
   age of the year: Example: TCO 1325-096-300 LAST PACKAGE CY 08. Indicate the assigned pack-
   age number and the TCO account number immediately to the right of the unit designation in the return
   address element on the outside of each package. An example for the correct recording on the package
   wrapper:


       62 FSS/MSPPP (TCO 1560-012-050) McChord AFB WA 98438-5016


   The numbers illustrate: 1560 - TCO account number, 012 – calendar year package sequence number,
   and 050 - number of answer sheets enclosed in the package. When there is a break in the sequence of
74                                                                   AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008


     package numbers from an individual TCO account, HQ AFPC Test Management Office notifies the
     TCO to begin tracer action.

A9.17. Score Notices. After promotion lists are announced for a particular grade, score notices are avail-
able to airmen considered for promotion through the virtual MPF.

A9.18. Score Verification. If an airman has evidence indicating a scoring error occurred, he or she for-
wards this evidence with a request for verification to the FSS Commander for action. A request for verifi-
cation of test scores will only be considered when there is substantial evidence a scoring error may have
occurred. The FSS Commander disapproves requests for verification based on identical test scores, same
score as previous year, several identical scores within the same AFSC or unit, drop in test scores, or miss-
ing promotion by a narrow margin. Also, disapprove requests based on an airman’s belief that test scores
do not reflect his or her study efforts or that post-test review of his or her study materials identified more
correct answers than reflected in the score. The FSS Commander forwards requests with substantial evi-
dence of an error to HQ AFPC Test Management Office for action.

A9.19. Release of Promotion and Testing Results. Any airman not specifically authorized by HQ
AFPC/DPS, Director of Personnel Services, is prohibited from providing or obtaining enlisted promotion
and testing results before official promotion release.

A9.20. Use of Test Scores. The only purpose of SKT, PFE, and USAFSE scores is to assess an airman's
specialty and general military knowledge for promotion consideration in the WAPS/Senior NCO Promo-
tion System. Other than promotion and testing personnel for official actions, the examinee and his /her
unit commander are the only individuals authorized access to the test results. All other requests for access
to test scores for any other use are not authorized.

                DEFENSE LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY TEST (DLPT) SYSTEM

A10.1. Purpose. THE DLPT System serves to evaluate the ability to understand written and/or spoken
material presented in a foreign language and as required ability to speak a foreign language.

A10.2. Description. The DLPT System is the DoD standardized testing system that consists of:
   A10.2.1. DLPT I through IV, pencil and paper tests:
       A10.2.1.1. Test listening and reading.
       A10.2.1.2. DLPT I & II allotted 3 hours, 1 ½ hours per modality.
       A10.2.1.3. DLPT III & IV allotted 6 hours, 3 hours per modality.
   A10.2.2. DLPT 5, computer based/web-delivered tests.
       A10.2.2.1. Test listening and reading.
       A10.2.2.2. Allotted 6 hours, 3 hours per modality.
   A10.2.3. Oral Proficiency Interviews (OPI).
       A10.2.3.1. Test speaking.
       A10.2.3.2. Telephone interview.
   A10.2.4. Defense Language Reading Proficiency Test (DLRPT).
       A10.2.4.1. Test reading only.
   A10.2.5. Defense Language Proficiency 2-Skill Interview.
       A10.2.5.1. Test speaking and listening.
       A10.2.5.2. Telephone interview.

A10.3. Personnel Tested. Test all Airmen in the regular Air Force, ANG, or AFRC and AF Civilians
who claim proficiency in one or more foreign languages. You must also:
   A10.3.1. Support, as able, testing other Service members and DoD civilians who request a test under
   the DLPT System.
   A10.3.2. Dependents of military airmen and DoD civilians if required for a special duty assignment.
   A10.3.3. Personnel identified by HQ AFPC Test Management Office and the AF Senior Language
   Authority.

A10.4. Administering DLPTs:
   A10.4.1. Testing can be conducted during any month of the year.
   A10.4.2. When retesting, administer an alternate version if one is available. Select the version at ran-
   dom to determine which version to administer if you do not know which one the individual took pre-
   viously. DLPT 5 tests are randomly selected by the web based system.
76                                                                   AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008


     A10.4.3. If an individual claims proficiency in a language approved for FLPBB for which a DLPT is
     not listed in AFPT Catalog, DLIFLC conducts Oral Proficiency Interviews (OPIs) to assess an indi-
     vidual's foreign language speaking and listening skills. OPIs will only be conducted for FLPBB qual-
     ification or to satisfy a mandatory requirement.
     A10.4.4. Use headsets to administer all DLPTs. Follow local testing procedures to determine specific
     equipment components needed.

A10.5. OPIs. To request an OPI, send a memorandum to HQ AFPC Test Management Office via email
with the following information:
     A10.5.1. Individuals’s full name, rank, SSN, and branch of service.
     A10.5.2. Name, phone (DSN, commercial, and fax), and e-mail address of individuals’s TCO.
     A10.5.3. Individuals’s organization and address with POC.
     A10.5.4. Requirement for testing (i.e., FLPB re-certification) and language to be evaluated.
     A10.5.5. Commercial phone number that interview will be conducted on. (Note: Number must not be
     in individuals’s living quarters, unit, or workplace. Number must be under the control and supervision
     of the TCO.)
     A10.5.6. Suspense date for interview.
     A10.5.7. Date of last interview, if available. Note: HQ AFPC Test Management Office will forward
     request to DLIFLC for scheduling. Advise Airmen that OPI request should be submitted at least six
     weeks prior to FLPB expiration in order to allow time for DLIFLC to schedule prior to FLPB expir-
     ing. However, submission six weeks prior does not guarantee that an OPI will be scheduled before
     FLPB expiration

A10.6. Retesting:
     A10.6.1. Retest personnel receiving FLPB within 12 months of previous administration. Unless oth-
     erwise required, personnel testing to qualify or re-qualify for FLPB are responsible for meeting this
     requirement. Failure to meet the annual requirement will result in the loss of FLPB.
     A10.6.2. Do not retest personnel until at least 6 months have passed from the date the test was last
     administered unless granted an exception by HQ AFPC Test Management Office. Recent completion
     of a formal language training course (defined as at least 60 hours of training or equivalent) and
     requirement to test prior to PCSing to attend in-residence language training are potential exceptions to
     policy.

A10.7. Scoring DLPTs. DLPTs use independent scoring systems.

A10.8. Recording DLPT and DLRPT Scores:
     A10.8.1. Report results by proficiency levels in a listing or memorandum. File a copy in the Unit Per-
     sonnel Record Group (UPRG) and in the office files. Update results in the personnel data system using
     the codes in Table A10.1. Refer to the interagency language roundtable website at www.govtilr.org
     for a complete description of the proficiency levels.
     A10.8.2. Do not remove test results from an individuals's record unless they are superseded.
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                           77


A10.9. Using Scores. Results are used to select personnel for programs or assignments that may require
minimum language proficiency levels. They are also used to determine eligibility for FLPB.

A10.10. Disposition of Completed Answer Sheets. Forward all completed DLPT and DLRPT answer
sheets to DLIFLC monthly. Refer to Table 3.1. for details.

Table A10.1. Language Proficiency Levels and Codes.

                        AIR FORCE READING ABILITIES TEST (AFRAT)

A11.1. Purpose. The AFRAT evaluates the reading abilities of individuals by measuring their reading
grade level (RGL). It may be used to assess reading proficiency of airmen at any time during their careers.
Results may be used to make personnel decisions about remedial reading programs, training, PME, or
other Air Force programs.

A11.2. Description. The AFRAT is available in two parallel forms. Each form contains two parts that
measure vocabulary and reading comprehension. Scores are reported as RGLs. The AFRAT is designated
as FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.

A11.3. Personnel Tested. Any airman may take the AFRAT.

A11.4. Administering the AFRAT. HQ AFPC Test Management Office approves administration of the
AFRAT by personnel other than an authorized TCO or TE. Exception: First-Term Airman Centers, Air-
man Leadership Schools, and NCO academies may administer the AFRAT to students. Education offices
are also authorized to administer the AFRAT. Order materials through the base TCO. Answer sheets are
not available from the distribution center; reproduce locally to replenish stock levels.

A11.5. Retesting. Wait at least 6 months from the date of the last AFRAT before retesting unless the air-
man has participated in a remedial reading program. Use the alternate form.

A11.6. Recording AFRAT Scores. Score locally and document scores and date of test. File a copy in the
airman’s personnel record and provide a copy to the individual.

A11.7. Disposing of Completed Answer Sheets. Refer to Table 3.1.

                                 STRENGTH APTITUDE TEST (SAT)

A12.1. The SAT is used by the Air Force as a classification tool to ensure enlisted recruits have the phys-
ical strength to perform the physical demands of military jobs. The standards were developed with the
assistance of the Air Force Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory and ongoing validation is supported
by the Human Effectiveness Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory. OPR for the program is
AF/A1PF.

A12.2. The SAT is a weight lifting test performed on an incremental lifting machine (ILM) at MEPS. The
Air Force Liaison NCOs assigned to MEPCOM conduct the strength test as part of the classification and
counseling process per USMEPCOM Regulation 40-1. An instructional video is available to demonstrate
the proper way to perform the SAT. Written instructions on proper weight lifting techniques have also
been issued to MEPS personnel by HQ AFRS/RSO.

A12.3. The test requires recruits to lift weights starting at 40 pounds. The weight is then increased in
10-pound increments until the recruit:
   (1) cannot complete a lift
   (2) asks to stop
   (3) lifts 100 pounds, the maximum requirement of any Air Force job

A12.4. The ILM has a carriage with handles that move vertically in metal channels. To complete or pass
a lift, the examinee must raise the weight carriage until the handles reach or exceed a height of 6 feet
above the standing surface.

A12.5. Job qualifications standards on the SAT have been established for all Air Force enlisted special-
ties. Standards are based on average physical demand weighted by frequency of performance and percent
of the AFS members performing a task. The benefits of the SAT include:
 (improved job performance, improved job satisfaction through reduction of inadequate performance due
to physical capabilities, lower attrition and retraining costs from personnel losses due to lack of ability to
perform job physical demands, reduced exposure to injuries from over-exertion.

A12.6. Current strength standards required for entry into all career fields are listed in the AFECD.

                         FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY BONUS

A14.1. What is FLPB:
   A14.1.1. FLPB is a monetary incentive paid to eligible and qualified military and civilian personnel
   possessing foreign language proficiency. The objective of FLPB is to encourage the acquisition, main-
   tenance, and enhancement of foreign language skills vital to national defense. The ability of the Air
   Force to interact in the international arena and respond effectively to any global contingency mandates
   the need for qualified personnel to communicate with our allies and the local populations as well as
   with our adversaries.
   A14.1.2. Individual participation is voluntary. An airman's application, qualification, and receipt of
   FLPB constitute acknowledgment that he or she may be called upon to respond to global contingency
   requirements.

A14.2. Who Authorizes FLPB:
   A14.2.1. FLPB is authorized under Title 37, U.S.C., Section 316 and is administered according to
   DoDI 7280.03 and DoD Military Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual.
   A14.2.2. The Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) determines which foreign languages, specialties, and
   duties qualify under the Air Force FLPB program. SAF may initiate, terminate, increase, or decrease
   FLPB.
   A14.2.3. HQ USAF/A1D is the service program manager (SPM) for the Air Force Foreign Language
   Program (AFFLP) and FLPB. HQ USAF/A1D represents the Air Force in the Defense Foreign Lan-
   guage Program (DLP). The SPM provides management policy for the development, coordination, and
   conduct of the FLPB Program as well as for the AFFLP. At the direction of HQ USAF/A1D, attach-
   ment 14 assigns responsibilities required to administer FLPB under uniform policy within existing
   directives. HQ USAF/A1D also approves language-designated positions (LDP) in agencies employ-
   ing Air Force personnel and determines which languages are authorized FLPB within the Air Force.

A14.3. Requirements for FLPB Eligibility:
   A14.3.1. Active duty airmen must:
      A14.3.1.1. Be entitled to basic pay under Title 37, U.S.C, Section 204.
      A14.3.1.2. Be certified as proficient using the DLPT System in an authorized foreign language
      within the past 12 months. For example, if an airman certifies the first year on 15 Aug 08 and does
      not re-certify until 17 Oct 09, he or she will not be eligible for FLPB from 16 Aug -16 Oct 09. The
      responsibility to retest in a timely manner is the responsibility of the airman. EXCEPTION: An
      Airman who is unable to re-certify within 12 months because of a contingency operation or
      assigned outside the continental United States to a location where web-delivered testing facilities
      are not available and/or accessible will be recertified as proficient based on the previous DLPT
      system score for up to 180 days after return from contingency operations or released from the duty
      assignment remain entitled to FLPB. In addition, an Airman who is attending formal language
      education will be recertified as proficient based on the previous DLPT system score until comple-
      tion of the formal language training course and remain entitled to FLPB. If the airman fails to
82                                                                   AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008


        retest, FLPB will terminate effective 180 days after completion of the contingency deployment,
        completion of language training, or release from the duty assignment as applicable. When possi-
        ble, the airman must test prior to departure on the contingency, duty assignment, or attendance at
        DLI language training school.
     A14.3.2. Reserve and ANG component members must:
        A14.3.2.1. Be entitled to compensation under Title 37, U.S.C., Section 206.
        A14.3.2.2. Meet the same requirements as active duty airmen.
     A14.3.3. DoD civilian personnel.

A14.4. FLPB Qualification:
     A14.4.1. Personnel will qualify annually for FLPB by taking the DLPT or OPI in the language to
     which they are assigned or qualified. Those individuals assigned in a foreign country where Air Force
     representation or installations are not normally located should test before reporting to the country
     when possible. All personnel selected for intermediate or advanced language training conducted at
     DLI must test prior to departing their losing unit as part of out-processing.
     A14.4.2. Testing personnel schedule and conduct annual DLPT testing in a manner that ensures air-
     men receiving FLPB will test within 12 months but not sooner than 6 months from their previous
     administration.
     A14.4.3. Individuals are solely responsible for contacting the Military Testing Facilities to arrange for
     initial and annual testing, understanding that failure to test as scheduled may result in loss of FLPB.
     The individual’s request for initial testing must include acknowledgement that once qualified for
     FLPB, failure to retest annually will result in a loss of FLPB.
     A14.4.4. Airmen must qualify in listening and reading modalities, if available. Airmen may also be
     administered the speaking test for FLPB qualification. Refer to paragraph A10.5. to arrange an OPI
     for FLPB qualification or if a DLPT is not available in a particular language for which FLPB is autho-
     rized. If an individual's language proficiency cannot be evaluated through testing or interview, he or
     she cannot be certified for FLPB.
     A14.4.5. Individuals who fail to qualify in a language cannot retest in that same language until at least
     6 months have passed from the date the test was last administered unless granted an exception by HQ
     AFPC Test Management Office. This is a mandatory requirement and cannot be waived unless an
     individual has participated in vigorous formal training to increase language proficiency or is required
     to test as a result of selection to attend intermediate or advanced language training at DLI. HQ AFPC
     Test Management Office and HQ USAF/A1D will determine if training meets this criterion.
     A14.4.6. FLPB is effective the date of testing. Pay rate changes are also effective the date of the test.
     A commander cannot deny an airman from taking a DLPT System test in order to qualify for FLPB.
     A14.4.7. DLPT scores from DLIFLC as well as those obtained during BMT are valid for FLPB.
     A14.4.8. Airmen deployed to contingencies or TDY in an LDP are eligible for FLPB with supported
     commander's certification, line item remarks on contingency, exercise, and deployment (CED) or
     TDY orders qualify as commander’s certification. Valid DLPT System score is required prior to TDY/
     deployment in order for an Airman to qualify for FLPB during TDY/deployment. Exceptions to this
AFI36-2605 24 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                           83


   paragraph, A14.4.8., are dependent on HQ USAF/A1D (AF Senior Language Authority) determina-
   tion.

A14.5. FLPB Re-certification: Pay rate changes for airmen recertifying are effective on the date of the
re-certification test.

A14.6. Quarterly Reconciliation:
TCOs must perform quarterly reconciliations between pay data in Defense Joint Military Pay System
(DJMS) and personnel data in the personnel data system. The quarterly data reconciliations are sent to
each TCO from HQ AFPC Military Entitlements Branch and suspensed for completion.

A14.7. FLPB Payment:
   A14.7.1. Individuals claiming proficiency for multiple languages can receive FLPB for all of their
   languages provided the languages are approved for FLPB and the monthly payment does not exceed
   the maximum cap of $1,000 per month.
   A14.7.2. Listening, Reading, and Speaking Proficiency levels will be used to determine the amount
   of pay. A minimum proficiency of 2/2 is required in at least two modalities (listening, reading, and/or
   speaking) in order to receive proficiency pay. Exceptions to this policy will be determined by HQ
   USAF/A1D (AF Senior Language Authority) based on contingency deployment position require-
   ments and specific special operations position requirements.
       A14.7.2.1. FLPB payment is determined using the chart below and the current AF Strategic Lan-
       guage List (obtainable from the HQ USAF/A1DL website or contact HQ USAF/A1D at
       af.a1dll@pentagon.af.mil) Use the matrix below to determine the amount of monthly payment.
       Decision logic is required to identify the language tested and determine which category that lan-
       guage belongs to (i.e., FLPB A, FLPB B, or FLPB C). Airmen serving in a language designated
       position (LDP) or language inherent AFSC (1A8, 1N3, 8D0, 9L0 and 16F) as validated by the
       Career Field Manager will be paid at FLPB payment rate A, regardless of language.
       A14.7.2.2. Update the appropriate personnel data system code to document the scores. Ensure the
       appropriate FLPB code, based on scores is also updated via the Language and DJMS update menu
       in the personnel data system.
       For example: If an airman tested in Turkish and scored a 2+ / 3 on the test, you would follow
       FLPB A Table since Turkish is a FLPB A language and then update the personnel data system
       code F / G to document the test scores. Then, update FLPB code 33 which is the correct code
       based on the scores and language being updated. This action would authorize the airman to receive
       $350 per month for FLPB.
       A14.7.2.3. If a language has been determined as “Dominant in the Force” in the AF Strategic Lan-
       guage List”, then the member must be in a LDP or language inherent AFSC in order to receive
       FLPB for that language.

       A14.9.1.4. Establish a command-level foreign language program in coordination with DLIFLC,
       Distance Education Division and HQ USAF/A1D. This includes assisting subordinate units in
       establishing, obtaining materials, and maintaining appropriate language maintenance facilities and
       programs.
   A14.9.2. The Reserve Management Group monitors individual mobilization augmentee (IMA) per-
   sonnel eligible for FLPB and requests the IMA closely coordinate test scheduling with the appropriate
   Military Testing Facilities. IMA personnel are to be tested at their assigned or attached Military Test-
   ing Facilities, whichever is most convenient for the airman and least costly to the Air Force.
   A14.9.3. Testing Personnel will:
       A14.9.3.1. Assist unit commanders by publicizing program requirements and identifying person-
       nel requiring testing.

        view to the requesting TCO.

A15.5. Guidelines. Supervisors, managers, and commanders when identifying FLPB linguist require-
ments will use the following.
     A15.5.1. As determined by the supervisor and approved by the commander or designee identified in
     paragraph A15.4.1., when proficiency in a foreign language facilitates performance of officially
     assigned intelligence-related duties, the position description must specify the language(s) or category
     of languages.
     A15.5.2. If the position an employee occupies is not a LDP, LCP, or identified by a language inherent
     AFSC, the employee may be paid FLPB if the Commander or designee identified in section A15.4.1.
     approves his / her request and he / she successfully passes a DLPT for the languages listed in A14.1.
     Employee must sign a Mobility Agreement stating agreement to be “subject to immediate assignment
     to a position” that meets the requirements in A15.3.1.2.
     A15.5.3. Commanders, supervisors, and employees all share responsibility to ensure language docu-
     mentation is accurate and reviewed annually.

A15.6. Procedures:
     A15.6.1. Determination of FLPB Level:
        A15.6.1.1. Supervisors determine appropriate FLPB payment level based on proficiency ratings
        from the DLPT. (See Table 11.1 for approved languages.)
