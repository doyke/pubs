                        RIMS / SRS EQUIPMENT DESCRIPTION

1.1. General: The RIMS are designed to monitor eight discrete frequencies in the microwave
range from 245 Megahertz (MHz) to 15,400 MHz. Detailed RIMS instrumentation and
operational theory information is contained in TO 31M3-4-5-1, and other applicable RSTN
technical manuals.      The SRS differs from discrete frequency (RIMS) radiometers in
instrumentation, theory of operation, and type of activity observed. The SRS detects solar radio
frequency emissions in the 25 to 180 MHz range. This range falls within the meter and
decameter (tens of meters) region of the radio spectrum, which corresponds to wavelengths of 1
to 100 meters and frequencies of 3 to 300 MHz. Details of the SRS instrumentation and
operational theory, swept frequency burst types, and data reduction and interpretation, are
contained in the SRS Operations Manual. Analysts should review the manual before assuming
SRS patrol responsibilities.
1.2. RIMS Antennas.
   1.2.1. The RIMS antenna systems consist of three parabolic reflectors (commonly known as
   “dishes”), antenna feed systems, transmission lines to the receivers (or radiometers), and
   tracking systems. Each parabolic dish collects radio waves from the sun and reflects them to
   a point of convergence, known as the antenna focus. Either a log periodic feed, dipole feed,
   or waveguide feed horn is located at the focus to receive the radio signal. Each feed is
   designed to be sensitive specifically to the range of frequencies to be observed by the
   antenna. To transfer the energy from the feed to the receiver system, special transmission
   lines must be used. Shielded coaxial cable is used for frequencies lower than 8800 MHz.
   For 8800 MHz and higher frequencies, coaxial cable attenuation is too great, so waveguides
   are used.
   1.2.2. The antennas are mounted on pedestals which track in azimuth and elevation
   coordinates. The angle which sweeps the horizon in a clockwise direction from north
   looking down on the antenna is the azimuth, ranging from 0 to 359 degrees. Therefore, east
   is 90 degrees azimuth, south is 180 degrees, and west is 270 degrees. The angle between the
   local horizontal plane and a point above the horizon is the elevation, measured from 0
   degrees at the horizon to 90 degrees at zenith. Computer controls in the operations rack and
   mounted on the antenna riser maintain the track of celestial objects such as the sun, moon,
   and Cassiopeia-A. Additional objects can be tracked if the ephemeris data for that source are
   entered into the operations center computer. A Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver
   maintains accurate clock time to assist the solar tracking.
   1.2.3. Two sets of drive motors (two in azimuth, two in elevation) are installed in the
   antenna pedestals to drive the antennas. There is no solar optical or radio signal feedback or
   guider system provided to ensure tracking accuracy; that is provided by the GPS clock and
   operations room antenna control unit. Antenna control unit (ACU) equipment (ViaSat®
   model 3883) in the operations center for each antenna system are identical, but the system
   control units (SCU) at the antenna risers are unique to their specific pedestal model (3415 for
   3'/8', 3425 for 28'). For manual procedures refer to applicable TO and/or operator manual.

    1.2.3.1. The “Standby” switch on the operations center ACU controls AC power to the
    antenna drive motors and servos. Switching the console to standby mode removes power
    and locks the internal brake assemblies in the drive motors. NOTE: Ensure that the
    antennas have come to a complete stop before switching to standby mode. Sudden
    removal of power from drive motors when the antenna is moving locks the brakes and
    can cause motor or gearbox failure.
    1.2.3.2. The “Solar Track” switch applies power to the track drive motors and associated
    circuitry, so that the antennas move according to antenna position commands issued by
    the operations center ACU console. Due the high accuracy of the GPS time standard,
    periodic re-peaking of the antennas is not required at any time through the day. The solar
    ephemeris coordinates maintain highly accurate tracking.
    1.2.3.3. The “Cold Sky” switch commands the ACU to position the antenna 30 degrees
    azimuth toward the pole (northward in the northern hemisphere; southward if in the
    southern hemisphere) of its current position and then to stop tracking. The power
    remains applied to both motors and servos in the pedestals, ready for moving to a new
    location (does not switch to standby).
    1.2.3.4. The “3-min Drift” switch commands the ACU to position the antenna three
    minutes of time ahead in its solar track, and then to stop tracking. This position allows
    the sun to drift across the antenna to perform the integrated flux measurement (IFLUX).
    The antenna will hold at this position until told to move elsewhere (such as solar track)
    (does not switch to standby).
    1.2.3.5. The “Night Stow” switch moves the antenna to 180 degrees azimuth, 90 degrees
    elevation, vertically stowed, the normal nighttime position. When the antenna stops, the
    ACU commands change to standby mode, AC power is removed from the motors and
    servos, and the internal brakes are applied to the motor shafts.
    1.2.3.6. The “Storm Stow” switch moves the antenna to a prescribed location which
    affords the antenna system the greatest survival potential in times of strong winds, heavy
    snow or icing. This position is unique to each observatory, and its position must be
    entered manually into the configuration tables in the ACU for each antenna. Default
    position is the same as Night Stow. After the antenna has stopped, the ACU commands
    the pedestal to switch to standby mode, AC power is removed from the motors and
    servos, and the internal brakes are applied to the motor shafts.
    1.2.3.7. The “Abort Track” switch halts routine solar tracking, stopping wherever it is
    currently pointing. It does not turn AC power off at the SCU. It can be used at any time
    so maintenance can examine antenna systems or whenever patrol must be disrupted for a
    short period.
    1.2.3.8. The “HALT ABORT” octagonal stop sign switch in the upper right corner
    provides an immediate halt to all antenna operations, switches the pedestal to standby
    mode, removes AC power from the motors and servos, and engages the brake assemblies
    in the motors. This is an emergency stop switch for all antenna operations, equivalent to
    pressing the red emergency shutdown button on the outside SCU. NOTE: When the
    antenna is slewing, this may cause damage to the antenna motors or gearboxes. It will
    not cause damage if the antenna is in track mode.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                    7


   1.2.4. The existing radio antennas cannot resolve radio emissions from individual regions on
   the sun. Instead, at any given frequency they detect the solar radio output integrated over the
   full area of the sun.
      1.2.4.1. Each antenna has a half power beamwidth (HPBW) roughly five times the
      optical solar diameter, or about two and a half degrees (Figure 1.1). This HPBW allows
      an antenna to see the entire solar disk at one time, without differentiating the sun’s limb
      from its center. This ability is necessary to meet the requirement that each antenna’s
      sensitivity be constant across the solar disk. NOTE: As explained in Chapter 5, the
      higher the frequency of solar radio energy, the lower it is produced in the sun’s
      atmosphere. Thus the apparent diameter of the sun depends on the radio frequency in
      which it is observed. For example, the radio sun is approximately the size of the optical
      sun at 30,000 MHz (Figure 1.2), and it increases to nearly twice that diameter at 150
      MHz.

Figure 1.1. Antenna Beam Pattern.




Figure 1.2. Approximate Size of the Radio Sun in Solar Radii.




      1.2.4.2. Each antenna is highly directional. They are very effective in receiving signals
      when aimed directly at the source. When the antenna is moved away from the source, the
      received power drops off sharply. This characteristic reduces the impact of local radio
      frequency interference (RFI) on solar observations.
      1.2.4.3. Nearly all of the collected energy is concentrated in the main beam of the
      antenna. The maximum gain is 20 to 200 times less in the side lobes than in the main
 8                                                      AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


        beam. However, since the side lobes occupy a large portion of the space surrounding
        each antenna, strong signals in the side lobes (due to reflected solar emissions or external
        non-solar interference) can sometimes simulate solar activity in the main lobe.
        1.2.4.4. The parabolic dishes used in solar radio patrol have different diameters, chosen
        so the combination of frequency (or frequency range) desired and diameter yields
        approximately a fixed resolution. The relationship between resolution (R in radians),
        wavelength (L in feet or meters), and antenna diameter (D in feet or meters) is: R = L/D
        (where L and D are in the same units). Thus small diameter dishes (3 and 8 feet) are
        required for short wavelengths (i.e., high frequencies), while a larger dish (28 feet) is
        required for longer wavelengths (i.e., lower frequencies).

     1.3.1. The sun is a strong source of radio energy emission. However, the solar radio power
     received at earth is very small compared to that received from terrestrial sources, such as
     radio and television stations. Therefore, the receivers (radiometers) used to detect and
     measure solar radio emissions must be very sensitive, with minimal internal sources of
     sensitivity (or gain) variability.
     1.3.2. The radiometers used in the RIMS telescopes are designed to minimize equipment
     gain changes. Controlling room temperature and humidity can minimize large gain changes
     caused by the environment. The sensitivity of the radiometer can be varied through the use
     of several gain channels for each discrete frequency, so that a wide dynamic range of solar
     emissions can be recorded. A short explanation of the radiometer equipment follows:
        1.3.2.1. Broadband radio frequency (RF) signals from the sun initially arrive at the
        antenna. The antenna feed converts the radio energy into an electrical signal, which is
        fed through a waveguide or coaxial cable to the radiometer.
        1.3.2.2. A calibration signal can also be fed into a radiometer through a directional
        coupler. The calibration signal is produced by a solid-state device (commonly called a
        noise tube (NT), even though it is no longer physically a “tube”). When energized, it
        generates RF noise at a known and constant output. The NT signal, or some other
        calibrated synthetic signal, is necessary to accurately calibrate a radiometer and
        compensate for long term gain instability. The NT output should always remain stable.
        1.3.2.3. In the next stage, the RF signals arrive at a Dickie switch (an electronic switch
        nominally switching at a 500 Hertz (Hz) rate) located between the antenna signal and the
        matched load (a 50 ohm precision resistor source). The Dickie switch is activated by a
        switch driver that is synchronized by a reference signal generated in a Lock-In Amplifier.
        1.3.2.4. The RF signal, modulated by action of the Dickie switch, now passes to a
        mixer/pre-amp where it (i.e., the antenna signal at the designated frequency for the
        particular radiometer) is “beat” against a local oscillator signal. The usable output from
        the mixer is a 30 MHz intermediate frequency (IF) signal fed to the IF amplifier stage.
        The lower frequencies (245 through 1415 MHz) have double IF amplifiers to provide
        approximately 55 decibels (dB) gain for the Medium and Low gain channels, and 90 dB
        gain for the Very High and High gain channels. This double IF system is necessary for
        the low frequency systems, since the sun’s output at low frequencies can change by a
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                    9


      factor of up to 100,000. At high frequencies, the largest change in solar radio flux is
      normally only one hundredfold.
      1.3.2.5. The IF amplifiers further demodulate the signal and extract a square wave with a
      frequency equal to the switching frequency of the Dickie switch. The amplitude of the
      square wave is proportional to the varying signal received by the system from the sun.
      This signal is then fed to the 5207 Lock-In Amplifiers (LIA).
      1.3.2.6. The output of the LIA is a DC voltage proportional to the sun’s signal. Other
      signals may be injected into the radiometer for tests and calibrations, but all signal
      measurements, whether solar or man-made, are measured at the output of the LIA. A
      very low signal may appear on the LIA meter or digital readout as a positive voltage, but
      most measurable signals will be of a more negative value.
      1.3.2.7. The sensitivity of a slave radiometer may be operated in either a “Track” or
      “Calibrate” mode. The “Track” position is used for normal radio patrol operation, while
      the “Calibrate” position is used (only on slave amplifiers) for calibrating the equipment.
      All master LIAs remain in the “Track” setting at all times.
1.4. SRS Antennas.
   1.4.1. The SRS system uses two antennas to monitor the entire frequency range of
   operations. The fixed semi-bicone antenna monitors from 25-75 MHz (low band) and the
   directional tracking antenna monitors from 75-180 MHz (high band). The relatively low
   frequencies (25 to 180 MHz) detected by the SRS correspond to disturbances high in the
   solar atmosphere, specifically in the corona (Table 5.1). At sunrise, coronal radio emission is
   detectable before the RIMS radiometers begin to detect solar signals, and at sunset, it is
   detectable even after the RIMS radiometers cease to detect solar signals. However, both the
   SRS and RIMS radiometers use the same three-degree definition for official radio sunrise
   and sunset for two reasons. First, both types of observations are subject to the same
   unreliability near sunrise and sunset caused by constructive and destructive interference of
   the radio waves. Second, the whole corona is actually the last portion of the sun to clear the
   horizon at sunrise, and the first portion of the sun to go below the horizon at sunset.

                                          Chapter 2

                RIMS/SRS POWER-UP AND SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES

2.1. General.
   2.1.1. Types of equipment, equipment configuration, and power sources may vary with each
   observatory. Consult all applicable TOs, Computer Operations Manuals (COMs), and the
   RIMS Analysis Software Users Manual when writing local procedures. Use guidance
   provided in this chapter to develop local equipment and computer procedures to cover the
   following situations:
      2.1.1.1. Normal Power-Up and Shutdown (e.g., sunrise and sunset).
      2.1.1.2. Complete Power-Up and Complete Shutdown during the observing day (e.g.,
      during severe weather such as lightning within 5 nautical miles; or when room
      environmental limits exceed safe/proper thresholds for computer or telescope equipment).
      2.1.1.3. Emergency Power-Up and Emergency Shutdown during the observing day (e.g.,
      during severe weather and/or when hazardous conditions exist or are imminent such as
      flood, fire, electrocution, etc).
2.2. Normal Power-Up Procedures.
   2.2.1. Vary the following listed actions, and their order, as needed to meet local
   requirements:
      2.2.1.1. Turn on the SRS monitor.
      2.2.1.2. Ensure the SRS system time is accurate to within plus or minus one second of a
      calibrated coordinated universal time (UTC) source. NOTE: UTC, Zulu (Z), and
      Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) are used interchangeably.
      2.2.1.3. Ensure SRS applications are operational and the HP spectrum analyzers are
      functioning properly. The SRS Solar Control (SOLACON) program will indicate On,
      Track and DATA during normal operations.
      2.2.1.4. Turn on the communication equipment (if necessary).
      2.2.1.5. Turn on the RIMS computer and boot up, using appropriate guidance.
      2.2.1.6. Ensure the RIMS Analysis parameters, status and burst threshold are correct.
      NOTE: The burst threshold determines burst start and end times, and thus mean and
      integrated flux computations. In the absence of RFI or noise storm activity, the burst
      threshold will be routinely set at 100 solar flux units (SFUs) burst peak report ability
      threshold to ensure consistency in reported burst times and fluxes within the radio
      network. Ensure the 2695MHz burst threshold is changed to match the current base line
      setting or 100 SFUs, whichever is lower.
      2.2.1.7. Turn on the antenna controls.
          2.2.1.7.1. Place all RF input switches in the “ANTENNA” position. Calibration
          switches will remain in the “LOAD” position.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  11


          2.2.1.7.2. Ensure all sixteen “normalize” lights are lit on the 5207 LIAs. If any are
          unlit, follow the detailed guidance in paragraph 2.3.
      2.2.1.8. Turn on the remote Solar Observing Optical Network (SOON) television (TV)
      monitor (if applicable).
   2.2.2. Ensure the RIMS Analysis system clock is accurate to within plus or minus one
   second of a calibrated UTC source.
   2.2.3. Perform morning calibration in accordance with (IAW) Chapter 3, then position the
   antennas to acquire patrol at sunrise IAW guidance from applicable TO.
   2.2.4. The correct Azimuth and Elevation can be obtained automatically by the ACU.
   Additionally, the Azimuth and Elevation can be retrieved manually from AFWA IMT 18,
   RSTN Daily Activity Log which should already be prepared or run the RIMS Analysis solar
   ephemeris program.
2.3. Renormalization and Stabilization Procedures.
   2.3.1. Notify maintenance of all power outages (regardless of duration), so they can
   renormalize the 5207 LIAs, if needed. NOTE: Uninterruptible Power Systems (UPS)
   should provide the observatories with a smooth continuous power transfer to backup
   generators. However, extenuating circumstances may still cause total power outages.
   2.3.2. Log all affected discrete frequencies out on the AFWA Form 20, Equipment/
   Communications Outage Log as MINIMAL (or Yellow if applicable) outages, but do not
   transmit a patrol status code (STATS) message to take the frequencies off patrol, since data
   can still be collected and analyzed.
   2.3.3. If the power outage lasted less than 10 minutes, the following restrictions apply until
   the amplifiers are renormalized.
      2.3.3.1. Power outages, brownouts, and surges are the most likely cause for loss of
      amplifier normalization. While it is possible to perform a daily system calibration and
      IFLUX measurement, analysts should make every effort to have radios renormalized
      before any calibrations are attempted. Any power interruption can cause switch settings
      to be scrambled on 5207 LIAs, and erroneous calibration values are a likely result. If
      erratic values are accidentally accepted, additional calibrations (once the LIA is
      renormalized) may be required to bring the affected radio back to acceptable calibration
      values and baseline. It is not necessary to qualify IFLUX values just because of the lack
      of normalization, since only the slave amplifier is likely to be doubtful.
      2.3.3.2. Qualify any burst on the upper four frequencies (2695 to 15400 MHz) that enters
      the slave amplifier range as uncertain due to equipment problem (report status code q=2),
      until the amplifiers are renormalized. Other bursts do not need to be qualified just
      because of the lack of normalization.
   2.3.4. If the power outage lasted (or is suspected to have lasted) 10 minutes or more, the
   radiometers also need a 1-hour stabilization period. More than one hour may be needed
   during winter months at high latitude sites. During this period:
      2.3.4.1. Do not perform any calibrations or IFLUX measurements.
 12                                                  AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


       2.3.4.2. Qualify all bursts observed on all the discrete frequencies as uncertain due to
       equipment problem or when reported burst flux values exceed slave amplifier range per
       Table 4.1 (20% RANGE column), (report status code q=2).
   2.3.5. Once normalization is restored, a new system calibration is required only if a
   calibration was done during the non-normalized period, or if a stabilization period was
   necessary. If doubtful of the current calibration, a new calibration is suggested.
   2.3.6. Log the frequencies back in service on the AFWA Form 20 when all corrective
   actions have been taken.
2.4. Normal Shutdown Procedures.
   2.4.1. Transmit the STATS messages before shutting down the RSTN equipment and/or
   computer. NOTE: RIMS Analysis program automatically archives data.
   2.4.2. Stow the antennas per TO and local procedures. EXCEPTION: Protection of the
   antennas against snow/ice accumulation takes priority over wind protection. Whenever there
   is the slightest chance of snow/ice accumulation, “winter-stow” the antennas IAW guidance
   in TO 31M3-4-6-1.
   2.4.3. Vary the listed actions, and their order, as needed to meet local requirements and
   follow established SRS/RIMS shutdown procedures.
       2.4.3.1. Turn off the remote SOON TV monitor (if applicable).
       2.4.3.2. Turn off the RIMS computer.
       2.4.3.3. Place all RF Input Switches to the “LOAD” position.
       2.4.3.4. Ensure all Calibration Switches are in the “LOAD” position.
       2.4.3.5. Turn off the communications equipment (if applicable), and any personal
       computers (PC).
       2.4.3.6. Turn off the SRS monitor.
2.5. Complete Shutdown Procedures. If, during the observing day, thunderstorms or lightning
are within 5 nautical miles (NM) of the site, or if room environmental limits are exceeded, take
the actions listed below. These actions won’t guarantee safety from lightning strikes; however,
they should provide a reasonable degree of protection. If environmental limits are exceeded in
the RSTN operations room or computer room only, it is not necessary to do a shutdown of the
equipment in the other room. The radio racks themselves are only powered down in emergency
situations (e.g., fire, flood, electrocution, etc).
   2.5.1. If time permits, transmit the STATS messages before shutting down the RSTN
   equipment and/or computer. If a patrol message isn’t sent, log the shutdown time on the
   RSTN Daily Activity Log and call the 2 WS/Space Weather Operations Center
   (SPACEWOC) to advise them on site status. NOTE: If conditions (thunderstorms,
   environmental, etc) prevent running data archival, inform the Non-Commissioned Officer in
   Charge (NCOIC).
   2.5.2. Vary the listed actions, and their order, as needed to meet local requirements and
   follow established SRS/RIMS shutdown procedures.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 13


       2.5.2.1. If appropriate, storm-stow or winter-stow the antennas.
       2.5.2.2. Place all RF Input Switches to the “LOAD” position.
       2.5.2.3. Ensure all Calibration Switches are in the “LOAD” position.
       2.5.2.4. Turn off the antenna control units.
       2.5.2.5. Turn off the remote SOON TV monitor (if applicable).
       2.5.2.6. Turn off all small computers (e.g., PCs).
       2.5.2.7. Turn off the communications equipment (if appropriate).
       2.5.2.8. Ensure the downtime is logged on the AFWA Form 20 for inclusion in the End
       of Day Summary (NWXX60) message and the unit’s Monthly Outage Report.
2.6. Complete Power-Up Procedures. These procedures are the same as Normal Power-Up
procedures in paragraph 2.2, with only two exceptions listed below.
   2.6.1. Issue a patrol (STATS) message to “up” the equipment and call the SPACEWOC to
   inform them of status.
   2.6.2. Calibration of the radios before resuming patrol is not required unless the downtime
   happens to occur at sunrise, or during the NOON IFLUX time.
2.7. Emergency Shutdown/Power-Up Procedures. Due to site and configuration differences,
emergency procedures will vary at each observatory. Local procedures, however, will specify
what actions are to be taken in case of severe weather, flooding, fire, electrocution, etc. The
procedures will highlight which buildings, power sources, and circuit panels will be affected by
each shutdown action. The procedures will also include step-by-step directions on how to
restore power and re-establish patrol after the emergency is over.

                                          Chapter 3

                                 SOLAR RADIO OBSERVING

3.1. Opening Procedures.
   3.1.1. Arrival on Site.
      3.1.1.1. Arrive early enough to accomplish all opening procedures before sunrise. For
      RSTN (both discrete frequency and SRS) operations local radio sunrise and sunset are
      defined as the time when the sun center is three degrees above the apparent horizon
      (based on a smooth, spherical earth adjusted to reflect permanent local obstructions, such
      as ridgelines or buildings). Both discrete frequency and SRS solar radio energy can be
      detected prior to "official radio sunrise"; however, the data collected may be unreliable
      due to radio wave constructive and destructive interference.
      3.1.1.2. Review any notes from the previous shift, latest End of Day Summary
      (NWXX60) message, and outage logs.
      3.1.1.3. Perform an environmental check. Check the hygrothermograph or its equivalent
      (and do so periodically throughout the observing day). When either the room
      temperature or relative humidity is exceeding the environmental limits listed below for
      more than 30 minutes, perform a "Complete Shutdown" of the radio (discrete frequency
      and SRS) equipment. Use local "Complete Shutdown" procedures developed from
      guidance in Chapter 2 and IAW applicable TO.
          3.1.1.3.1. Temperature: 50 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
          3.1.1.3.2. Relative Humidity: 25 to 75 percent.
   3.1.2. Power up. Power up equipment using locally developed procedures (with the aid of
   guidance in all applicable TOs and AFWAMAN 15-2, Chapter 2).
   3.1.3. Calibrations. Calibrate the discrete frequency radiometers as required in Chapter 4.
   3.1.4. Antenna Positioning.
      3.1.4.1. Check the wind equipment before moving the antennas out of their nightly stow
      position. If winds are above operational limits (45 knots/~55 mph sustained or gusts), the
      antennas should be left in (or moved to) the storm-stow position (unless local
      maintenance advises that motion under these circumstances could cause more damage
      than leaving the antennas where they are). NOTE: At certain sites, maintenance may
      occasionally lock the 28-foot antenna pedestal. If locked, request maintenance assistance
      in bringing the antenna to the sunrise position.
      3.1.4.2. Position the antenna on the sun using the Solar Track function in the antenna
      graphic user interface (Model 3883 Antenna Controller). If the antenna fails to
      automatically acquire and track the sun, immediately contact Maintenance. Do not
      attempt to manually position the antenna without authorization from Maintenance.
   3.1.5. Discrete frequency or SRS activity in progress when patrol is acquired (either at
   sunrise or after a break in patrol).
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                        15


      3.1.5.1. If possible, prepare a Discrete Solar Radio Burst (BURST) or SWEEP message
      IAW AFMAN 15-124, Meteorological Codes.
          3.1.5.1.1. Use the start time of patrol as the burst or sweep start time.
          3.1.5.1.2. Apply any required attenuation corrections to discrete bursts.
          3.1.5.1.3. Use the appropriate data qualifiers and time qualifier for a discrete burst.
      3.1.5.2. If enough reliable data could not be collected for a meaningful BURST or
      SWEEP message, send a PLAIN message instead. This PLAIN will at least alert the
      forecast centers that some activity occurred.
      3.1.5.3. If the activity is event-level, the analyst has two options:
          3.1.5.3.1. If it is known that the activity has already been reported and is over 15
          minutes old, do not send an event-level preliminary message; instead, use routine
          (AXXX71) MANOP headers for the BURST or SWEEP message. A common
          example is a long duration Type IV sweep.
          3.1.5.3.2. If it is not known that the activity has already been reported and is over 15
          minutes old, respond as if it were a new event (i.e., send an event-level preliminary
          message and use event (SXXX61) MANOP headers for the BURST or SWEEP
          message). Also append a PLAIN indicating site just acquired the sun and the event
          may or may not be new activity.
3.2. Patrol Procedures.
   3.2.1. Position antennas to acquire the sun as soon as practical but not later than 5 minutes
   before radio sunrise. Once the solar signal is acquired adjust the baseline values through the
   RIMS Analysis Graph Settings window, ensure the 2695 MHz burst threshold is changed to
   match the current base line setting or 100 SFUs, whichever is lower. The IFLUX function
   can also be used to collect a small data sample after the sun has cleared any local
   obstructions and has risen high enough to limit atmospheric attenuation. By saving the data
   sample through the IFLUX function, the baseline values will be reset to the latest radio
   background output of the sun.
   3.2.2. Patrol (STATS) Reports.
      3.2.2.1. Transmit an initial STATS message at radio sunrise, whether or not patrol is
      acquired. During the day, issue a STATS message when any frequency or the SRS is
      down, or expected to be down, for more than 5 minutes, and again when it is restored to
      service. Transmit a final STATS message at radio sunset after the end of the observing
      day.
      3.2.2.2. The opening time is when any functioning frequency or the SRS acquires the sun
      and displays a reasonable solar signal. A reasonable signal is one in which the analyst
      can collect and analyze burst or sweep data, whether qualified as good or uncertain. The
      opening time can be no earlier than "official radio sunrise". Maintain patrol on each
      discrete frequency and the SRS as long as a reasonable solar signal is available. Closing
      time can be no later than "official radio sunset".
      3.2.2.3. If some frequencies are attenuated or blocked by obstructions at sunrise, do not
      delay transmitting the opening STATS message. The opening message should include
16                                                   AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


     the status (up or down) of each frequency monitored by the site, plus the SRS. Transmit
     additional STATS messages as other frequencies or the SRS becomes operational and
     acquires the sun. If unable to transmit messages, telephone SPACEWOC and advise
     them of the nature of the problem and when patrol is expected to be acquired. If
     appropriate, ask SPACEWOC to inform the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC)
     and other RSTN observatories.
     3.2.2.4. All patrol times reported should represent actual times patrol was lost or
     regained, which may not necessarily be the current or transmission time, or the time
     equipment is logged out for maintenance.
     3.2.2.5. If the reported expected outage time is later exceeded, transmit a new STATS
     message for the additional downtime.
     3.2.2.6. When performing weekly Preventative Maintenance Inspections (PMIs), it is not
     necessary to transmit a STATS message each time a frequency is taken off the air or
     restored to patrol. Instead:
         3.2.2.6.1. Call the SPACEWOC and request downtime for the PMIs. Inform
         SPACEWOC that each frequency will be off the air for approximately 5-10 minutes,
         and that they will be notified once maintenance is complete.
         3.2.2.6.2. Include the type of outage, initial start time, and final end time of the PMIs
         in the NWXX60 end of day message. Log outages and times on AFWA Form 20.
  3.2.3. Observing Routine.
     3.2.3.1. Check the screen displays for the discrete frequencies at least once every two
     minutes. These checks are needed to detect drifting baselines and spiky or gradual rise
     and fall bursts. Check the SRS display for activity at least every two minutes.
     3.2.3.2. If continuous, severe RFI makes patrol impossible on a particular frequency,
     take that frequency off patrol (e.g., change its status to "Down"). Issue the appropriate
     STATS message. It is not necessary to take an antenna off the sun due to RFI. See
     paragraph 3.2.11. for further instructions.
     3.2.3.3. Copies. It is recommended that analysts make electronic copies of all event-
     level burst activity for post analysis, quality assurance, training, and intersite data
     comparisons. Hard copies are mandatory at contractor-operated sites and will be
     forwarded monthly to 2WS/DOZ.
  3.2.4. Forms and Data Reporting.
     3.2.4.1. Use the AFWA IMT 18 to record burst, sweep, IFLUX, and patrol data.
     3.2.4.2. Transmit data reports as soon as possible, but not to exceed the timeliness limits
     stated in this chapter and summarized in Attachment 2.
     3.2.4.3. Transmit plain language (PLAIN) messages as needed to clarify information in
     coded data reports or to report information not reported by any other message. These
     PLAIN messages may be appended to another coded data message or sent separately
     using an AXXX70 MANOP header. Avoid using program names or other terms in a
     PLAIN, which may not be known or clear to all recipients.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                17


  3.2.5. BURST Reports.
     3.2.5.1. Encode and transmit all bursts with peak flux of 100 SFUs or greater. Do not
     report a burst with peak flux less than 100 SFUs unless:
        3.2.5.1.1. It is a gradual rise and fall burst.
        3.2.5.1.2. It is part of a spectral group (defined in this guidance) and at least one
        frequency in the group has a peak flux of 100 SFUs or greater.
        3.2.5.1.3. In the analyst's judgment, the burst is significant and contributes to
        understanding what occurred or supports activity reported by another site.
        3.2.5.1.4. RAD00 EVENT is reached, even if the peak is under 100 SFU.
     3.2.5.2. Noise storms are reportable only during that period when they are producing
     peaks of 100 SFUs or greater, relative to the pre-storm baseline. Refer to Chapter 6 for
     guidance on analysis and reporting of noise storms.
     3.2.5.3. For non-event discrete (fixed) frequency bursts, transmit final reports within 15
     minutes after burst end (45 minutes if the burst is a noise storm). Use an AXXX71
     MANOP header for all non-event BURST reports. Preliminary non-event reports are
     optional, but are encouraged if producing them would not interfere with other operations.
     Exception: For noise storms, transmit a preliminary within 30 minutes after storm start
     time.
     3.2.5.4. When a computer generated BURST message appears to be incorrect, the analyst
     must evaluate the data and change the message as necessary. The analyst can use the
     burst reanalysis program, and the observation should still be qualified as automatic data
     reduction.
     3.2.5.5. Superimposed Bursts. Report a superimposed burst separately from a noise
     storm, gradual rise and fall burst, or the tail end of another impulsive burst. Guidelines
     for identification of superimposed bursts are contained in this manual. Analyze
     superimposed bursts relative to the current, enhanced background, since such a burst
     represents radio energy output over and above both the normal background solar output
     and the enhanced output from the other burst. When appropriate, qualify the
     superimposed burst as uncertain data due to interference.
     3.2.5.6. Burst Corrections.
        3.2.5.6.1. Attenuation Corrections. Burst attenuation may occur near sunrise, sunset,
        during heavy cloud cover, or precipitation. An attenuation correction is required for
        all bursts on discrete frequencies where the current baseline has dropped more than
        10 percent below either the most recent IFLUX value (for sunrise or sunset bursts) or
        the pre-attenuation baseline (for weather attenuation).
        3.2.5.6.2. Linearity Corrections. During large discrete frequency bursts, flux values
        may require a linearity correction for a non-linear response in the slave LIA. The
        computer will automatically apply any required linearity corrections (if needed) to the
        peak, mean, and integrated flux values using data stored in the program from the
        linearity calibration.
18                                                  AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


        3.2.5.6.3. Use the guidance in Chapter 4, Section 4.4 when performing linearity
        calibrations. Use procedures in Chapter 6, Section 6.7 to compute and apply
        attenuation corrections.
     3.2.5.7. Spectral Bursts. Spectral (multiple frequency) bursts are defined in chapter 6.
     Normally, all the discrete frequencies involved should be reported in a single message,
     with the same local burst serial number. However, if a spectral burst starts very close to
     the end of the GMT day, the start time on some frequencies may be just before 2400Z,
     while on other frequencies it may be just after 0000Z. In such a case, prepare and
     transmit separate BURST code messages, since the BURST code does not allow
     inclusion of data for more than one GMT day in a single message.
  3.2.6. SWEEP Reports.
     3.2.6.1. For non-event sweeps, transmit final reports within 45 minutes after sweep end
     time data availability. Use an AXXX71 MANOP header for all non-event SWEEP
     reports. For long-duration (e.g., Type 6, 7, or 8) sweeps, transmit a preliminary within 30
     minutes after data availability (i.e., type identification).
     3.2.6.2. When a long duration sweep increases in intensity, issue an updated preliminary.
     Use an AXXX71 MANOP header for the update, even if the sweep is a Type II or Type
     IV, since there are no intensity-related event thresholds for sweeps. If the intensity
     category later decreases, do not issue another preliminary, or end that sweep and start a
     new sweep. (The situation is similar to a discrete frequency burst slowly returning to
     background; once a peak intensity is reached, that intensity is always assigned to the
     burst). If desired, a PLAIN message can be issued to advise the field of the decline in
     intensity.
     3.2.6.3. Assume any continuum sweep which immediately follows a significant radio,
     optical, or X-ray event is a Type IV continuum (vice a Type 8 continuum), even if no
     Type II sweep was observed. Consult Chapter 7, for additional guidance on Type IV and
     Type 8 continuums.
     3.2.6.4. Whenever possible, determine a Type II’s shock wave speed and encode IAW
     AFMAN 15-124. The shock speed will be used in various models to forecast the onset of
     delayed geophysical effects and their impacts on Department of Defense (DoD) radar,
     communications, and space systems.
     3.2.6.5. Report individual Type III and Type V sweeps when they are distinctly separate
     from other, underlying SRS activity and/or their start times coincide exactly with a
     discrete frequency burst or optical activity. For example, an isolated intensity 2 Type III
     should be reported separately from an ongoing intensity 1 Type 8 continuum.
     3.2.6.6. Classify and report all non-Type IV continuums as Type 8 continuums.
  3.2.7. Adverse Weather.
     3.2.7.1. For strong winds equal or exceeding 45 knots/~55 miles per hour (mph)
     (sustained or gusts), storm-stow all antennas at 90 Deg in elevation and 0 Deg in azimuth.
     Straight up corresponds to 90 Deg in elevation and provides the least cross-section for
     wind loading. Furthermore, the antennas may be stowed at a lower wind speed threshold
     at the discretion of the local Detachment Commander for older, more worn antennas or
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   19


      when the patrol position is particularly vulnerable to wind loading. NOTE: High winds
      will not affect the low band antenna during SRS patrol.
      3.2.7.2. For protection against potential snow and/or ice accumulation, "winter-stow" all
      antennas IAW guidance in TO 31M3-4-6-1. Coordinate with maintenance on the
      removal of accumulated snow and/or ice.
      3.2.7.3. When both strong winds and snow/ice accumulation are forecast or occurring,
      protection of the antennas against snow/ice accumulation takes priority.
      3.2.7.4. If thunderstorms or lightning are within 5 NM of the site, perform a computer
      and telescope "Complete Shutdown" using local procedures developed IAW applicable
      TO and/or operator manual and chapter 2 of this publication.
   3.2.8. Emergency Shutdown. When severe weather, fire, flooding, electrocution, etc.,
   immediately threaten the facility, equipment, or personnel, use local "Emergency Shutdown"
   procedures, developed IAW applicable TO and/or operator manual and chapter 2 of this
   publication.
   3.2.9. Power Up Procedures. After a "Complete Shutdown" of the computer and/or
   telescope systems (e.g., due to thunderstorms or exceeding room environmental limits), or an
   "Emergency Shutdown", power up using local procedures developed IAW applicable TO
   and/or operator manual and chapter 2 of this publication.
   3.2.10. Non-Solar Radio Interference. When unexplained, strong, recurring interference
   occurs on any frequencies (including the SRS), notify the NCOIC and/or the Detachment
   Commander, and have them contact Host Base Interference Spectrum Manager to coordinate
   isolation.
   3.2.11. Shift-Change Briefings. As a minimum, include:
      3.2.11.1. Recent and/or current solar activity (both optical and radio), and RFI problems
      observed locally or at another site. If applicable, mention significant active regions due
      to return in the near future.
      3.2.11.2. Equipment and/or computer outages,            communication       problems,   plus
      anticipated PMIs, power outages, or other problems.
      3.2.11.3. Status of other sites.
      3.2.11.4. Any shift duties not accomplished.
      3.2.11.5. Any special support requirements.
3.3. Closing Procedures.
   3.3.1. Discrete frequency or SRS activity in progress at radio sunset.
      3.3.1.1. If possible, prepare a final BURST or SWEEP code message IAW AFMAN 15-
      124.
          3.3.1.1.1. Use the end time of patrol as the burst or sweep end time.
          3.3.1.1.2. Apply any required attenuation corrections.
          3.3.1.1.3. Use the appropriate data qualifiers.
 20                                                     AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


       3.3.1.2. If enough reliable data could not be collected for a meaningful BURST or
       SWEEP message, send a PLAIN message instead. This PLAIN will at least advise
       SPACEWOC and SWPC that some activity occurred.
       3.3.1.3. Append these BURST, SWEEP, and/or PLAIN messages to the final STATS
       message to ensure a complete report describing solar and observatory status at the end of
       the observing day. NOTE: If these messages are transmitted separately, the data will
       still be accepted by SPACEWOC and SWPC databases, but only the last transmitted
       message can be recalled by Winds Information Display System (WINDS) message
       viewer.
   3.3.2. Termination of Patrol.
       3.3.2.1. Transmit a final STATS message and the End of Day Summary (NWXX60)
       message at radio sunset. The NWXX60 may be issued up to 30 minutes prior to radio
       sunset if appropriate. NOTE: RIMS Analysis program automatically archives data.
   3.3.3. Normal Shutdown.
       3.3.3.1. Turn off equipment using locally developed "Normal Shutdown" procedures,
       and guidance in Chapter 2. If thunderstorms are forecast overnight or observed nearby at
       sunset, follow the computer and telescope "Complete Shutdown" procedures instead.
3.4. Event-level Activity.
   3.4.1. Radio Event Definitions.
       3.4.1.1. Multiple discrete (i.e., fixed) frequency bursts meeting Castelli-U criteria as
       defined in Chapter 6. NOTE: Use caution when performing maintenance on the 1415-
       4995 MHz radiometers. If a large burst occurs, the computer may falsely recognize a
       downed radio for the pronounced “dip” and generate a false Castelli U.
       3.4.1.2. Radio bursts, which equal or exceed 5,000, 10,000 or 50,000 SFUs above
       background on any discrete frequency. NOTE: One SFU = 10 -22 Watts per meter
       squared per Hertz.
       3.4.1.3. Radio bursts on 2695 MHz, which are 100 percent or more above the pre-burst
       baseline (also known as a “tenflare” because of its approximation with the 10 cm
       wavelength).
       3.4.1.4. Type II or IV swept frequency bursts.
   3.4.2. Reports. Send all required data reports as soon as possible, but not to exceed the
   timeliness limits specified below and summarized in Attachment 2.
   3.4.3. Event-level Bursts.
       3.4.3.1. Transmit an event-level preliminary BURST message within 2 minutes after
       event start, or within 2 minutes after first peak over 5,000 SFUs for a noise storm. If a
       final BURST code message can be ready for transmission before the preliminary is due,
       transmit the final instead.
       3.4.3.2. SPACEWOC is required to issue warnings at various thresholds based on RSTN
       data. Notify them by transmitting an event-level preliminary BURST message within
       two minutes when any of the following thresholds are met: NOTE: Extra preliminary
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 21


      BURST messages are optional, but may be useful to SPACEWOC and SWPC. Also,
      appended PLAIN EVENT threshold messages are optional but highly recommended,
      time permitting.
          3.4.3.2.1. Each frequency initially crosses 5000 SFU. Append a PLAIN indicating
          EVENT RAD05 for the first frequency that crosses this threshold.
          3.4.3.2.2. The first frequency initially crosses 10,000 SFU.      Append a PLAIN
          message indicating EVENT RAD11.
          3.4.3.2.3. The first frequency initially crosses 50,000 SFU.      Append a PLAIN
          message indicating EVENT RAD55.
          3.4.3.2.4. Whenever one of the listed thresholds are met or exceeded (unless
          transmitted previously with the RAD11). If time allows, append a PLAIN indicating
          which frequency and threshold was met.
                410 MHz - 10,000 SFU
               1415 MHz - 10,000 SFU; 50,000 SFU
               2695 MHz - 10,000 SFU
               8800 MHz - 50,000 SFU
             15,400 MHz - 50,000 SFU
          3.4.3.2.5. The 2695 MHz frequency flux crosses 100 percent above the pre-burst
          baseline. Append a PLAIN message indicating EVENT RAD00.
          3.4.3.2.6. Multiple discrete (i.e. fixed) frequency bursts meet Castelli-U criteria as
          defined in Chapter 6. Append a PLAIN message indicating EVENT RADCU.
      3.4.3.3. Transmit an event-level preliminary BURST message within 5 minutes of the
      burst peak. This may result in multiple peak messages should the radio activity continue.
      Ensure the peaks for all the frequencies involved in the burst are included in the peak
      message.
      3.4.3.4. Transmit a final BURST code message within 10 minutes of burst end on all
      frequencies involved. EXCEPTION: For noise storms, transmit the final BURST
      message within 45 minutes of noise storm end.
      3.4.3.5. Transmit bursts uncorrected for attenuation effects (if necessary) to meet
      required timeliness limits. Qualify the data as uncertain and send corrected data as soon
      as possible.
   3.4.4. Event-level Sweeps.
      3.4.4.1. Transmit an event-level preliminary SWEEP message within 2 minutes after
      sweep type identification as a Type II or IV.
      3.4.4.2. Transmit a final SWEEP message within 30 minutes after sweep end time data is
      available.
3.5. IFLUX Standardization Procedures. The following procedures are designed to ensure
consistency in discrete frequency IFLUX and burst data within the radio network.
   3.5.1. Responsibilities of all RSTN Sites.
22                                                   AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


     3.5.1.1. The NCOIC or RSTN Section Chief must closely monitor the IFLUX values and
     qualifiers reported.
     3.5.1.2. Each site will compare its IFLUX values against the standard observatory
     (Kaena Point), based on only unqualified IFLUX values. The standard observatory will
     reference the values in Table 3.1 for baseline comparison. Each site will also compare its
     2695 MHz IFLUX value against the Penticton 2800 MHz, 2000 universal time (UT)
     value. The 2695 MHz value should be approximately 2.5 percent below the 2800 MHz
     value, and is a relative measurement.
         3.5.1.2.1. If a site's unqualified IFLUX values (on any frequency) differ by more than
         10 percent from the standard observatory’s values for 5-days, qualify the IFLUX
         value on that frequency.
         3.5.1.2.2. If a site's unqualified IFLUX values (on any frequency) differ by more than
         10 percent from the standard observatory’s values for more than 5 days, qualify the
         IFLUX value on that frequency and proceed with the following requirements:
             3.5.1.2.2.1. Log the frequency in the End of Day Summary; indicate the
             frequency has been out of tolerance for 5 days in the Outage section. Notify local
             maintenance personnel, and have them troubleshoot as needed. If maintenance is
             unable to find a cause for the problem, request further guidance from Lead
             Command Representative through AFWA Operations Center. Change NT values
             only as a last resort. Expend every effort to correct the problem by other means
             before changing a NT value.
             3.5.1.2.2.2. If the outage was logged in the End of Day Summary (NWXX60)
             message, update the log to show the outage was fixed and briefly note what action
             was taken (if a detailed fix-action explanation is required, send in a separate email
             correspondence to Lead Command Representative through AFWA Operations
             Center and 2WS/DO).
     3.5.1.3. If a change to equipment or NT values is accomplished that could affect a
     frequency's IFLUX value:
         3.5.1.3.1. Ensure the adjusted IFLUX value is correct by monitoring the value for
         three days before removing the data qualifiers.
     3.5.1.4. Each site will keep a record of all comparisons that indicate a problem may
     exist, NT changes, and equipment problems relevant to the intersite IFLUX
     standardization program.
  3.5.2. RSTN Absolute Flux Calibration Requirement. Over the course of a solar cycle due
  to unavoidable drift, the flux values at the RSTN observatories become widely divergent
  between observatories and from any sense of a standard calibration. To baseline the network,
  RSTN telescopes must be calibrated to an absolute standard once every 10-11 years
  coinciding with the solar minimum.
     3.5.2.1. The 2 WS/CC will serve as the moderator for all absolute flux calibration efforts
     to ensure seamless coordination and simultaneous action between all observatories. 2
     WS/CC will manage the overall process as follows:
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                               23


       3.5.2.1.1. Gather and review recommendations from the observatories, 2
       WS/SPACEWOC and AFWA/A8F to determine after-the-fact the best three-week
       window for quiet solar flux.
           3.5.2.1.1.1. Designate a three-week window from which the observatories will
           select seven days of quiet solar flux. These days must be free of interference from
           terrestrial weather. The designation of both the window and individual days will
           be after-the-fact.
           3.5.2.1.1.2. All observatories must successfully observe seven days of quiet sun
           within the designated three-week window. The selected days are not required to
           be consecutive as long as all seven days fall within the same designated three-
           week window. Additionally, the seven days chosen by one observatory may
           differ from the seven days chosen by another due to atmospheric conditions (i.e.
           weather), equipment anomalies, maintenance, etc.
       3.5.2.1.2. After all RSTN observatories have calculated their new “baseline” NT
       values and prior to the switch to the new values, users of the data must be notified of
       the impending switch so they can prepare for potential effects on their respective
       systems. 2 WS/CC will ensure notifications are sent to all users of the RSTN data
       and other appropriate organizations to include (but not limited to):
           3.5.2.1.2.1. The Space Environment Center in Boulder, Colorado.
           3.5.2.1.2.2. Air Force Space Command.
           3.5.2.1.2.3. The Australian Ionospheric Prediction Service Radio and Space
           Services in Sydney, Australia.
       3.5.2.1.3. Once notifications are made to all appropriate organizations, 2 WS/CC will
       direct the observatories to switch to the new values in unison or as close as possible
       considering the time zone differences between the observatories e.g., San Vito,
       Sagamore Hill, and Kaena Point could be directed by 2 WS/CC at 1800 UTC and
       Learmonth would switch prior to their next “opening” and conducting operations.
    3.5.2.2. RSTN observatories will adhere to the following technical procedures:
       3.5.2.2.1. Determine seven individual days of quiet solar flux (as directed by 2
       WS/CC) during which the solar radio fluxes are as near minimum value using the
       following four required conditions:
           3.5.2.2.1.1. The seven days must be within a few months of sunspot minimum
           and fall within the 2 WS/CC directed three-week period.
           3.5.2.2.1.2. No sun spots are observed on the solar disc for the chosen seven
           days.
           3.5.2.2.1.3. No plage is observed in H-alpha images of the sun for the chosen
           seven days.
           3.5.2.2.1.4. No radio burst or sweep activity detected from the sun for the chosen
           seven days.
           3.5.2.2.1.5. The days selected must be free of inclement weather and other types
 24                                                   AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


              of interference and/or variances from normal (e.g., thunderstorms, precipitation,
              cloud cover interference, power outages, tracking problems, signal strength issues
              etc.). Upon direction of the 2 WS/CC, the observatories will begin keeping a log
              of days affected by terrestrial weather and other forms of interference that would
              downgrade the quality of NT data. The observatories will be extra vigilant in this
              regard so as to ensure the best possible days are ultimately selected when the three
              week window is established.
          3.5.2.2.2. Average the IFLUX values for each frequency over the determined quiet
          seven days.
          3.5.2.2.3. Adjust the NT values on each frequency so that the flux with the new NT
          reading would have been the specified minimum value (listed in Table 3.1.).

          3.5.2.2.4. Use the graph depicted in Figure 3.1. to interpolate quiet values for other
          frequencies if required. The graph incorporates a smooth curve through the plotted
          points listed in Table 3.1.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                25


Figure 3.1. Graph of Solar Quiet Flux.




          3.5.2.2.5. Use   the    formula     (New_NT_Value       =   Old_NT_Value x
          Baseline_IFLUX_Value / 7-Day Average_IFLUX_Value) to compute new
          uncorrected NT values. Reference the following example computation:
              3.5.2.2.5.1. Assume that during the seven quiet days the average IFLUX for 1415
              MHz is determined to be 55 SFU.
              3.5.2.2.5.2. Also assume that the current uncorrected NT value for 1415 MHz is
              47.2 SFU.
              3.5.2.2.5.3. Note that the correct IFLUX for 1415 MHz at solar minimum should
              be 52 SFU (from Table 3.1.).
              3.5.2.2.5.4. The new uncorrected NT value would then be 47.2 x 52 / 55 = 44.6
              SFU.
3.6. Short Wave Fade reporting Procedures.
   3.6.1. The SRS has the ability to show short wave fades from strong x-ray flares (usually an
   M1 or higher). This information is extremely useful to 2 WS/SPACEWOC for verification
   of short wave fade (SWF) advisories and can be used for possible scientific studies. To take
   advantage of this information, a message will be transmitted to 2 WS/SPACEWOC by all
   observatories possessing an operational SRS whenever 2 WS/SPACEWOC issues a
   WOXX50 KGWC SWF advisory for a flare that reaches the M1 or greater level.
 26                                                 AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


   3.6.2. Use the following format (PLAIN report; see AFMAN 15-124, para 7.3) to submit this
   information when observed. NOTE: Since the AXXX70 is not programmed into any of the
   RSTN software, the analyst must manually enter the appropriate MANOP header.
      3.6.2.1. AXXX70 XXXX DDHHMM
       PLAIN
       SWF XXMHz Begin DDHHMM End DDHHMM or SWF NO
       Comments (optional)
       99999
      3.6.2.2. First line will contain the header (AXXX70), four-letter station identifier, and
      date time group (DTG) the message was issued.
      3.6.2.3. Second line will state this is a PLAIN message.
      3.6.2.4. Third line will identify this PLAIN as a SWF message, the maximum MHz
      absorption (i.e. 30MHz), DTG for begin time of SWF, and DTG for end of SWF. If 2
      WS/SPACEWOC issues a SWF advisory (X1 or higher) and no SWF is observed, the
      body of the message will be SWF NO. Because this is a relatively new method of
      observing short wave fades, begin and end times will be subjective. We can determine
      more objective criteria after a larger number of observations have been made and are
      available for study.
      3.6.2.5. Fourth line is optional and may contain any plain language comments that help
      explain the characteristics of the fade.
      3.6.2.6. A SWF PLAIN observation must be submitted to 2WS/SPACEWOC within 30
      minutes of receipt of the WOXX50 initial message only if SWF is being observed. A
      SWF PLAIN observation, whether SWF is observed or not, must be submitted to
      2WS/SPACEWOC within 30 minutes of receipt of the WOXX55 preliminary message. If
      SWF is still ongoing 30 min after receipt of either the WOXX50 initial message or the
      WOXX55 preliminary message, a final SWF PLAIN message must be issued within 30
      min of observed end of SWF.
   3.6.3. To ensure this requirement is met, all observatories must be on requirements to
   receive the WOXX50 KGWC SWF advisory, WOXX55 KGWC, and other RSTN
   observatories’ AXXX70. This can be received via the Weather Product Management and
   Distribution System (WPMDS), e-mail, phone, facsimile, or alphanumeric pager. See Air
   Force Weather WEB Services (AFW-WEBS) or contact the 2 WS/SPACEWOC for
   additional information.
   3.6.4. The observatory will forward an electronic copy (GIF format) to 2 WS/SPACEWOC
   spaceweather@offutt.af.mil of all SRS observed SWF’s no later than (NLT) the following
   day. This information will provide 2 WS/SPACEWOC examples that can be used to develop
   possible “rule of thumb” and training material.
3.7. Common Event Procedures.
   3.7.1. MANOP Headers. Select the appropriate event (SXXX60 EVENT or SXXX61
   prelim) or routine (AXXX61 optical or AXXX71 radio) MANOP header IAW guidance
   provided in this manual, AFMAN 15-124, and AFWAI 15-2. For event-level activity in
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 27


  progress when patrol is acquired (either at sunrise or after a break in patrol), consult
  paragraph 3.1.5.
  3.7.2. Event-Level Messages. Between sunrise and sunset, transmit an event-level
  preliminary message within timeliness criteria when:
     3.7.2.1. Any event threshold is reached at the observatory.
     3.7.2.2. Another observatory sends an initial (SXXX61) event-level FLARE, DALAS,
     BURST or SWEEP message and event thresholds are currently being met. If no
     thresholds are met, respond with the appropriate EVENT code message (see paragraph
     2.5.3., AFI 15-124, Meteorological Codes).
     3.7.2.3. An event is in progress and another event threshold is reached at the observatory
     or at another site.
  3.7.3. Optional Event-Level Messages. Although not mandatory, sites are encouraged to
  send an event-level preliminary message before local sunrise and after sunset, if doing so
  would not hinder the process of opening or closing the site.
  3.7.4. Event Message Acknowledgment. SPACEWOC decodes all BURST, SWEEP,
  DALAS, FLARE, EVENT SXXX60, NWXX53, NWXX54, and SXXX61 prelim MANOP
  header messages in real-time.
     3.7.4.1. If the solar event exceeds customer established criteria (optical flare 2B or
     greater or radio burst greater than 5,000 SFUs), SPACEWOC will issue a warning.
         3.7.4.1.1. A WOXX51 KGWC bulletin will be issued for optical flares equal to or
         greater than 3B.
         3.7.4.1.2. A WOXX50 KGWC bulletin will be issued for x-ray equal to or greater
         than M1 or, when x-ray data is unavailable, an optical flare equal to or greater than
         2B.
         3.7.4.1.3. A WOXX52 KGWC bulletin will be issued for radio bursts equal to or
         greater than 5,000 SFUs.
         3.7.4.1.4. A NWXX53 KGWC bulletin will be issued for radio bursts equal to or
         greater than 10,000 SFU on 410 MHz, 1415 MHz, and 2695 MHz.
         3.7.4.1.5. A NWXX54 KGWC bulletin will be issued for radio bursts equal to or
         greater than 50,000 SFU on 1415 MHz, 8800 MHz, and 15,400 MHz.
     3.7.4.2. If a warning is not received by the observatory within three minutes of event
     transmission, call SPACEWOC and retransmit the event message.
     3.7.4.3. If transmission of an event-level message is precluded for any reason, phone
     SPACEWOC immediately.
     3.7.4.4. Continue attempts to make rapid event notifications until a warning is received,
     a phone call is completed, or 15 minutes have elapsed from the time when event criteria
     or maximum was reached.
     3.7.4.5. At contract sites, retransmit any activity messages issued but not included in the
     summary reports. Include a PLAIN remark stating the reason for the retransmission.

     3.7.4.6. Review summary bulletins throughout the day and at least once per observing
     shift.
  3.7.5. REQST Message. When responding to a REQST message (TXXX50) from the 2WS
  SPACEWOC, observatories will respond with observed data within two minutes using the
  appropriate EVENT code IAW guidance in AFMAN 15-124, Chapter 6.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   29

                           RIMS AUTOMATED CALIBRATIONS

4.1. General. To accurately measure solar emissions, radio telescopes must be calibrated to
compensate for internal equipment variations in the antennas, cabling, and radiometers. This
chapter describes how various calibrations can be performed during automatic (i.e., computer
assisted) operations using the radio calibration (RCAL) program. Refer to the RIMS Analysis
Software Users Manual for program descriptions.
4.2. Daily System Calibration. This calibration establishes the SFU per volt conversion factors
and baselines for the computer. The daily system calibration is typically performed before
sunrise, at noon, and at other times specified in paragraph 4.2.1. The pre-sunrise, noon, and
unscheduled system calibrations differ only in a few steps, and in whether an IFLUX
measurement will be made. A SRS self-test will be automatically performed prior to sunrise and
may be performed during the noon discrete frequency system calibrations. The SRS self-test
procedures are described in Chapter 7, paragraph 7.2.3.4.1. NOTE: One SFU = 10-22 Watts per
meter squared per Hertz.
   4.2.1. Perform the Daily System Calibration at the following times:
       4.2.1.1. Prior to sunrise.
       4.2.1.2. At local noon, within plus or minus 1 hour of Central Meridian Passage (CMP).
       This calibration will normally include an IFLUX measurement. Accomplish IAW
       Chapter 5.
       4.2.1.3. After a NT value is changed, or after maintenance adjusts, replaces, or aligns any
       equipment component that alters the sensitivity settings or gain factors of the 5207 lock-
       in amplifiers (e.g., a rack alignment). NOTE: A new linearity calibration will also be
       required.
       4.2.1.4. Immediately before and after a linearity calibration is performed. These system
       calibrations are specially tailored, and are described as part of the linearity calibration
       procedures in paragraph 4.4.
       4.2.1.5. When the RSTN operation room temperature changes by more than five degrees
       (up or down) since the last system calibration. NOTE: Significant outside temperature
       changes of more than 30 degrees since the last calibration could affect the accuracy of the
       equipment and may require a new calibration.
   4.2.2. Delay performing calibrations when:
       4.2.2.1. No other radio site on patrol. NOTE: Make every effort to perform calibrations
       while another site is on patrol. Either start the IFLUX calibration early while another
       radio site is on patrol, or wait until another site starts patrol. If unable to perform the
       noon calibration while another site is on patrol, a split IFLUX procedure is mandatory
       IAW 5.1.1.4 and 5.2.2.
       4.2.2.2. Radiometers are in their 1-hour stabilization period after a power outage.
       NOTE: One hour may not be enough time in some cases. Consult with maintenance
       first if in doubt.
30                                                    AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


     4.2.2.3. Solar radio burst activity is high, and it's very likely that any calibration attempts
     would be futile and might result in failing to observe significant burst activity.
     4.2.2.4. Continuous RFI is in progress. Wait for the RFI to end before performing the
     calibration. Alternatively, a LOAD/LOAD system calibration as described in paragraph
     4.4.5., may be appropriate.
  4.2.3. When a NT is inoperative, all IFLUX values and bursts on the affected frequency
  should be qualified until the NT is replaced and a system calibration can be performed. For
  an extended outage, maintenance personnel may be able to operate the signal generator as an
  alternative noise source for any of the eight discrete frequencies, allowing for a normal daily
  system calibration.
  4.2.4. Ensure calibration data is within tolerance by comparing the maximum Master and
  Slave 5207 LIA values. The values must be within the values listed in Table 4.1.
  4.2.5. If event-level activity occurs while any system calibration or IFLUX measurement is
  in progress, the analyst should (if appropriate to the circumstances):
     4.2.5.1. Stop the calibration or IFLUX measurement and return the antenna or antennae
     to the sun as soon as possible.
     4.2.5.2. Qualify the transmitted burst data as uncertain.
  4.2.6. During the noon system calibration, perform an IFLUX IAW Chapter 5.                    For
  (timeliness) guidance on when to perform IFLUX, refer to Chapter 3.
  4.2.7. Setup.
     4.2.7.1. For Pre-sunrise calibrations: Ensure the antennas are off the sun (i.e., leave in
     stow position). NOTE: If snow stowed, move the antenna(s) 30 degrees toward the sky
     to avoid Earth-induced RFI.
     4.2.7.2. For Noon, or Unscheduled, Calibrations :
         4.2.7.2.1. Transmit a STATS message for all frequencies that will be off patrol
         during the calibration. NOTE: Normally it will not be necessary to include the SRS,
         since it will be off patrol for less than five minutes.
         4.2.7.2.2. Slew antenna(s) being calibrated approximately 30 degrees pole-ward of
         the sun for calibration by pressing the Cold Sky button on that antenna’s ACU.
         4.2.7.2.3. Check to see if RFI is evident. If it is, a minor adjustment in the east/west
         position may reduce it, or the antennas could be put 30 degrees east (behind) of the
         sun. If RFI still exists and time permits, wait for it to end before proceeding with the
         calibration.
  4.2.8. Running the RCAL Program (up to the drift).
     4.2.8.1. Select the RCAL option from the Calibration pull down menu.
         4.2.8.1.1. Select the frequencies to be calibrated.         NOTE:       Do not calibrate
         frequencies with excessive RFI in progress.
         4.2.8.1.2. Select astronomical correction (default).
     4.2.8.2. Select the Start RCAL button and follow the directions displayed on the screen.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                               31


       4.2.8.2.1. Cold Sky “Calibrate” Reading.
       4.2.8.2.2. Leave all Calibration Switches in the “LOAD” position, and all RF Input
       Switches in the “ANTENNA” position. NOTE: If RFI exists, wait for the RFI to
       end if time permits before proceeding with the calibration on the affected frequencies.
       Alternatively, the analyst can place the corresponding RF Input switch(es) in the
       “LOAD” position and proceed with the calibration, this is known as a “LOAD/LOAD
       System Calibration”. In a LOAD/LOAD calibration the phrase “cold sky calibrate
       reading” is misleading, but the value obtained is used exactly as if it were a cold sky
       reading.
    4.2.8.3. The system will collect approximately 10 seconds worth of cold sky (or
    load/load) data and then average the results.
    4.2.8.4. The following process is completed for the noise tubes.
       4.2.8.4.1. Turn all Calibration Switches to the “NOISE GEN” position. Ensure all
       noise sources are stable before continuing with the calibration.
       4.2.8.4.2. Allow the RIMS Analysis computer to take an approximate 10 second
       reading of the noise sources. Meanwhile, verify the presence of a noise source trace
       on graphic displays, (i.e., a deflection to the right of the cold sky trace).
    4.2.8.5. Upon completion of the sampling/averaging phase, the system will display the
    master maximum and slave uncorrected and corrected maximum SFU values.
       4.2.8.5.1. Caution: Accepting any seriously erroneous calibration values, such as
       4995MHz values outside the 10% tolerance, may necessitate additional calibrations to
       return the radio to acceptable cal values and baseline.
       4.2.8.5.2. The “MASTER” readouts are the maximum SFU values for the Master
       5207 LIAs.
       4.2.8.5.3. The “U SLV” (Uncorrected Slave) readouts are the maximum SFU values
       for the Slave 5207 LIAs before a linearity correction is applied.
       4.2.8.5.4. The “C SLV” (Corrected Slave) readouts are the maximum SFU values for
       the Slave 5207 LIAs after a linearity correction is applied. For any linear radios, the
       U SLV and C SLV values will be the same, since a linearity correction is not applied.
       4.2.8.5.5. For each discrete frequency, verify the Master and C SLV maximum
       values are within tolerance values listed in Table 4.1. NOTE: If a recalibration does
       not bring the value(s) into tolerance, log out equipment and notify maintenance unless
       RFI is the cause. Once the values are accepted they will be loaded for operational
       use, and the analyst should proceed with the calibration.
    4.2.8.6. Check the boxes to indicate which frequencies to accept or if performing a
    complete RCAL (all eight frequencies) the boxes are automatically checked.
    4.2.8.7. Select “Yes” when asked if Track Sky values need to be collected.
       4.2.8.7.1. Cold Sky “Track” Reading. This reading establishes the zero SFU level
       for each discrete frequency, and is also used in conjunction with the drift reading to
       determine IFLUX values.
 32                                                   AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


              4.2.8.7.1.1. Place all calibration switches to the “LOAD” position.
              4.2.8.7.1.2. Leave all RF Input switches in the “ANTENNA” position, or return
              them to the “ANTENNA” position if a “LOAD/LOAD System Calibration” is
              being done.
              4.2.8.7.1.3. The RIMS Analysis computer will automatically set the sensitivity of
              the Slave LIAs to the “Track” setting. If necessary, manually adjust the
              “UP/DOWN SET” keys on the amplifiers.
          4.2.8.7.2. Allow the computer to take an approximate 10 second reading of the cold
          sky. NOTE: Check the RIMS Analysis display to ensure no RFI was in progress
          during this reading. If RFI did occur, re-accomplish the calibration, since RFI here
          can cause low IFLUX values and baselines.
       4.2.8.8. Upon completion, close the RCAL window.
   4.2.9. Post-RCAL Program Procedures.
       4.2.9.1. For a pre-sunrise system calibration: Position the antennas to acquire the sun at
       radio sunrise.
       4.2.9.2. For a noon, or unscheduled, system calibration.
          4.2.9.2.1. Position the antenna on the sun and resume normal patrol. Transmit a
          STATS message showing the antenna(s) are on patrol.
4.3. Noise Tube (NT) Adjustments and Absolute Calibrations. The NT value is used during
daily system calibrations, and its accuracy is essential for consistent burst and IFLUX data
throughout the network. A new NT value (in SFU) is calculated after a correction factor is
derived from comparing several days’ worth of data from the reference observatory and the
entire network, to the IFLUX data from the site.
   4.3.1. Absolute NT Calibration. The Absolute NT Calibration requires continuously quiet
   solar conditions (same sun) and comparison with a reference observatory. This calibration
   requires comparing solar radio flux (IFLUX) readings from the observatory that needs to be
   calibrated, with readings from a reference observatory. The reference observatory must have
   previously been either calibrated directly against an absolute standard (e.g., stellar) radio
   source, or against another site, which was calibrated against an absolute standard. Typically,
   absolute calibrations will be performed during, or shortly after, solar minimum.
   4.3.2. NT Adjustments.
       4.3.2.1. Perform a NT adjustment as needed, or when any of the following occur:
          4.3.2.1.1. A noise source generator is replaced (and the output has changed). NOTE:
          This is a solid-state internal noise source generator, which is no longer physically a
          tube. However, the term NT is still in common use.
          4.3.2.1.2. Components from the Dickie switch to the antenna are replaced (causing
          the output readings to change).
          4.3.2.1.3. Burst and IFLUX data consistently differ from other radio sites'
          unqualified data by more than 10 percent. NOTE: NT values should only be
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                    33


           adjusted as a last resort. Make every effort to ensure all other avenues are
           investigated and/or exhausted, and a NT adjustment is necessary, before proceeding.
       4.3.2.2. Procedure.
           4.3.2.2.1. Pick a 3-5 day period with a minimum of solar activity. Average the
           unqualified IFLUX values from the standard observatory for each day. Example for
           410 MHz: (43 + 47 + 49)/3 = 46.33 SFUs. CAUTION: Large active regions
           appearing on the east limb, or rotating past the west limb, can cause significant
           differences in the IFLUX values. In the averaging process, use only IFLUX values
           that represent observations of the “same” sun.
           4.3.2.2.2. Find the ratio of the standard observatory’s averaged IFLUX value (e.g.,
           46.33) to the observatory’s IFLUX value (e.g., 38). EXAMPLE: 46.33/38 = 1.2192
           SFUs.
           4.3.2.2.3. Repeat the steps above for the other quiet days selected, and calculate an
           average ratio. EXAMPLE: (1.2192 + 1.3210 + 1.1156 + 1.4555)/4 = 1.2778 SFUs.
           NOTE: Look over all the values for the last several days’ data to ensure there is
           logical continuity. The key is to use stable (at each site) data, and data of the “same”
           sun. Do not try to hit a moving target (fluctuating due to changing solar conditions).
           The analyst should have a very good idea where the IFLUX should be at the present
           moment.
           4.3.2.2.4. Multiply the averaged ratio (e.g., 1.2778) times the current NT value
           (without an astronomical correction; e.g., 19.30 SFUs) to get an uncorrected NT value
           for use in daily system calibrations. EXAMPLE: 1.2778 x 19.30 = 24.66 SFUs (the
           new NT value).
       4.3.2.3. When a new NT value is determined:
           4.3.2.3.1. Ask maintenance to do a rack alignment on the affected radiometer, and
           then perform a system calibration with the new NT value input into the RIMS
           Analysis program. A new linearity calibration will also be required if the new NT
           value was cause for any adjustment on the IF Amplifier, the 5207 LIA, or the
           mixer/pre-amplifier.
           4.3.2.3.2. Update the RSTN calibration (RCAL) program with the new NT value.
           Maintain a permanent local record of all NT value changes (to include new value,
           date changed, and reason for change).
           4.3.2.3.3. Report the NT value change in at least three successive End of Day
           Summary (NWXX60) messages to ensure receipt by SPACEWOC and all other
           RSTN sites.
4.4. Linearity Calibration. This calibration corrects for inherent deficiencies found in the
radiometers (in particular, in the 5207 LIAs and IF Amplifiers). Normally, only large bursts,
which enter the range of a Slave 5207 LIA, will display distortions due to equipment limitations.
At times, problems can be detected within the range of a Master LIA, but these are normally
caused by alignment problems or malfunctioning equipment, and should be corrected by means
other than a linearity correction. The desired result from an automated linearity calibration are
the input values (Min Flux, Max Flux, A, and B) for entry into the non-linearity correction

values table. These values allow the computer to automatically apply any required linearity
corrections to automated bursts.
   4.4.1. Perform a linearity calibration at the following times:
       4.4.1.1. Anytime a radiometer rack alignment is accomplished. A rack alignment should
       be done when:
          4.4.1.1.1. A NT value is established that results in any change being made to the IF
          amplifier.
          4.4.1.1.2. Equipment, which could alter the sensitivity settings or gain factors of the
          LIAs, is adjusted or replaced. EXAMPLES: Replaced a Dickie switch or mixer pre-
          amp, replaced or readjusted an IF amplifier.
   4.4.2. When a linearity calibration is needed on a frequency, qualify bursts which enter the
   slave amplifier range as uncertain due to equipment until the linearity calibration can be
   performed. IFLUX values and bursts that remain in the master amplifier range will not
   normally be affected by the need for a linearity calibration. NOTE: If non-linearity occurs
   within the range of a master amplifier, or if a slave amplifier is non-linear throughout most or
   all of its range, an equipment problem exists and maintenance should be notified.
   4.4.3. Preliminary Setup.
       4.4.3.1. A maintenance technician must be present during the entire calibration. Request
       maintenance assistance to operate the signal generator throughout the calibration. Ensure
       the radio about to be calibrated has been stable for at least 48 hours. If not, postpone the
       linearity calibration.
          4.4.3.1.1. Make any last minute adjustments to the frequency’s radiometer before
          starting the calibration.
   4.4.4. Transmit a STATS message to take the frequency to be calibrated off patrol. NOTE:
   It will not be necessary to take the associated antenna off the sun during the pre-linearity
   system calibration or the linearity calibration. However, it will normally be necessary to take
   the antenna off the sun for the post-linearity system calibration’s track sky reading.
   4.4.5. Pre-Linearity System Calibration. This pre-linearity system calibration is a unique
   type of calibration, which can be referred to as a “LOAD/LOAD System Calibration”. It
   does not require the antenna to be moved off the sun. It is necessary to perform 2
   LOAD/LOAD RCALs before attempting the LINCAL. This will ensure that the Cold Sky
   RCALs are completely cleared out of the system.
       4.4.5.1. Load/Load RCAL.
          4.4.5.1.1. Select the Linearity Calibration (LINCAL) option from the Calibration pull
          down menu.
          4.4.5.1.2. Select the frequency requiring the LINCAL from the pull down box.
          4.4.5.1.3. Place both the Calibration switch and the RF Input switch in the “LOAD”
          positions. Perform a Load/Load RCAL, making sure to deselect the “astronomical
          correction” check box before starting the calibration.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 35


          4.4.5.1.4. Allow the computer signal to settle before taking a reading (takes
          approximately 10-15 seconds).
      4.4.5.2. Calibration Source Reading.
          4.4.5.2.1. Turn the Calibration switch to the “NOISE GEN” position.
          4.4.5.2.2. Leave the RF Input switch in the “LOAD” position setting (RIMS Analysis
          automatically switches the settings).
          4.4.5.2.3. Allow the computer to take an approximate 10 second reading of the Noise
          Tube (NT).
          4.4.5.2.4. The “MASTER”, “U SLV" and “C SLV” readouts are the maximum SFU
          values for the Master and Slave 5207 LIAs.
          4.4.5.2.5. Verify the Master and U SLV/C SLV maximum values are within the
          tolerance ranges set in Table 4.1. If a value isn’t within tolerance, do not proceed
          further. Ask maintenance to thoroughly check the equipment, and then re-accomplish
          the pre-linearity system calibration.

      4.4.5.3. Cold Sky “Track” Reading.
          4.4.5.3.1. Place the Calibration switch to the “LOAD” position.
          4.4.5.3.2. Leave the RF Input switch in the “LOAD” position. The reason for
          leaving the radiometer in “LOAD” during cold sky track (not the normal procedure)
          is to zero out the baseline in the RIMS Analysis computer before beginning the
          linearity.
          4.4.5.3.3. Ensure the absence of all NT traces on the RIMS Analysis display.
          4.4.5.3.4. Allow the computer to take a 10 second reading.
          4.4.5.3.5. If any discrepancies are noticed during the RCAL (e.g., a switch was
          discovered in the wrong position during a reading, or a calibration value was bad), as
          appropriate, investigate the reason for the problem and re-run the system calibration.

     4.4.5.4. After the pre-linearity system calibration is completed, leave the RF Input switch
     in the “LOAD” position, and ensure the RIMS Analysis is properly adjusted and running
     during the linearity calibration.
  4.4.6. Linearity Calibration Worksheet. Prepare a worksheet, computer printout or use a
  computer-based spreadsheet as shown in Figure 4.1 to record the linearity calibration data for
  completing LINCALS. The column headings for the automated linearity calibration
  worksheet are:
     4.4.6.1. “dB LEVEL” - This is the decibel level recorded from the signal generator.
     4.4.6.2. “TRUE (Y)” - This is the “True” SFU value calculated for each dB level by a
     routine described in paragraph 4.4.8.1. EXCEPTION: The very first “TRUE (Y)” value
     on the worksheet will be the current Uncorrected NT value.
     4.4.6.3. “MEAS (X)” - This is the “Measured” SFU value obtained directly off the
     analyst’s system terminal for each dB level.
     4.4.6.4. “DIV%” - This value (deviation) is obtained by dividing the “MEAS (X)” SFU
     value by the “TRUE (Y)” SFU value for each dB level.
  4.4.7. Performing the Linearity Calibration.
     4.4.7.1. Setup.
         4.4.7.1.1. Leave the antenna on the sun.
         4.4.7.1.2. Leave the RF Input Switch in the “LOAD” position. It should remain in
         this position throughout the linearity calibration.
         4.4.7.1.3. RIMS Analysis should be on, set properly, and running from the previous
         pre-linearity system calibration.
         4.4.7.1.4. Maintenance will connect a signal generator to the radiometer associated
         with the frequency requiring the LINCAL.
         4.4.7.1.5. Start the LINCAL spreadsheet program on a separate computer or have the
         printout ready if no spreadsheet program is available.
     4.4.7.2. Have maintenance obtain a noise tube-signal generator match.
         4.4.7.2.1. Ensure the Calibration Switch is in the “NOISE GEN” position.
         4.4.7.2.2. Place the Calibration Switch to the “CW CAL GEN” position, and leave it
         there throughout the remainder of the linearity calibration. Have maintenance adjust
         the dB setting on the signal generator until it matches the NT value.
         4.4.7.2.3. Record the dB setting on the first line of the spreadsheet under the heading
         “dB LEVEL” where match occurs.
         4.4.7.2.4. Read the current SFU value from the RIMS terminal. A good NT match
         value is critical to accomplishing a successful linearity. For the larger Slave LIA
         values it may be necessary to use an average of the readings, if the values fluctuate.
         Enter the value on the first line, under “MEAS” column of the worksheet. In Figure
         4.1, a sample value of 35 is entered for the measured SFU value.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 37


          4.4.7.2.5. Place the current Uncorrected NT value (in SFUs) on the first line under
          the “TRUE (Y)” column. In Figure 4.1, a sample Uncorrected NT value of 35.0
          SFUs is entered. NOTE: The “TRUE” and “MEAS” columns should be within 5
          percent of each other. If not, have maintenance check the radiometer and the signal
          generator. In Figure 4.1, the sample “TRUE” and “MEAS” columns are within 5
          percent of each other, so the calibration can continue.
          4.4.7.2.6. Calculate the “DIV%” (deviation value) for the noise tube-signal generator
          match, and log the result on the first data line. In Figure 4.1, the “DIV%” equaled
          1.00 (i.e., “MEAS (X)” = 35 divided by “TRUE (Y)” = 35.0).

      4.4.7.3. Have maintenance step the signal generator down in 2 dB increments for the
      Master LIA’s readings, and 1 dB increments for just before, during, and just after the
      crossover from the Master to the Slave LIA’s readings. Have maintenance continue with
      the 2 dB increments until the Slave LIA begins to go non-linear. Data points should be
      computed at 1dB intervals anytime a curve fit calculation is being performed. Straight-
      line data (linear) does not necessitate any extra data points. At each dB increment,
      record:
          4.4.7.3.1. The dB value from the signal generator in the “DB LEVEL” column.
          4.4.7.3.2. The measured SFU value from the analyst’s terminal in the “MEAS (X)”
          column.
      4.4.7.4. Identify the point of change over from the Master LIA to the Slave LIA, and
      mark it on the worksheet for future reference.
   4.4.8. Linearity Calculations.
      4.4.8.1. Calculate the “TRUE (Y)” SFU value at each dB level by multiplying the
      previous “TRUE (Y)” value by the appropriate Power Ratio (from Table 4.2), and log the
      result in the “TRUE (Y)” column. (This is usually done automatically by the
      spreadsheet.)

Change in dB’s                                                    =1.7 (i.e., 86.7 - 85.0)

        4.4.8.2. Calculate the deviation at each dB level by dividing the “MEAS (X)” value by
        the “TRUE (Y)” value, and record the results in the “DIV%” column (the spreadsheet
        will perform these computations).

   4.4.9. The Non-Linearity Point.
        4.4.9.1. A linearity correction should never be required for a Master LIA. In fact, if the
        master amplifier is non-linear, notify maintenance immediately since an equipment
        problem exists. The Slave LIA may go non-linear towards the end of its range, although
        it is not uncommon for a slave amplifier to remain linear throughout its range. A slave
        amplifier should not be entirely non-linear, or become non-linear after just a couple of
        readings. If this occurs, have maintenance verify the alignment of the radiometer.
        4.4.9.2. Determine where the Slave LIA starts to go non-linear. An indication of non-
        linearity is a sudden and continuous drop in the “DIV%” values. For example, in Figure
        4.3, the point of non-linearity begins at 47 dB. Since the point of non-linearity may not
        be obvious from the “DIV%” values on the worksheet, the plots must be graphed and the
        point of non-linearity must be determined from the graph.

     4.4.9.3. Compute averages of the “DIV%” deviation values for both the Master LIA and
     the linear portion of the Slave LIA. If either of these averages vary by more than 5
     percent notify maintenance immediately since excessive deviations may indicate a
     possible equipment malfunction. NOTE: Do not attempt to adjust either the Master or
     Slave LIAs’ sensitivity factors.
  4.4.10. Non-Linear Corrections for the Computer.
     4.4.10.1. Using the last 3 data points (but no more than 9) past the point of non-linearity,
     enter the reported and theoretical SFU values into the RIMS LINCAL window as X-Y
     pairs. Enter a carriage return after each pair and then zero, zero (0,0) for the last X-Y
     pair. NOTE: Must have at least 3 data points. If the radiometer goes non-linear at last
     two readings it is considered linear. Trying to add a third with a linear data point will
     make the U SLV value higher than the corrected.
  4.4.11. Post-Linearity Calibration Tasks.
     4.4.11.1. Place the RF Input Switch in the “ANTENNA” position, and the Calibration
     switch in the “LOAD” position.
     4.4.11.2. Type in the frequency’s baseline before the linearity calibration was performed.
     4.4.11.3. Reset the burst threshold for normal burst patrol (e.g., about 100 SFUs).
     Ensure the 2695MHz burst threshold is changed to match the current base line setting.
     4.4.11.4. Post-Linearity System Calibration: Perform two Cold Sky RCALs on the
     frequency, using the procedures from paragraph 4.2. This is necessary in order to clear
     the LOAD/LOAD RCAL values from the system. Take care to verify the accuracy of
     this calibration at each step. It is particularly important to ensure the Calibration Source
     Readings (“MASTER”, and “C SLV”) for both the Master and Slave LIAs are within the
     tolerance ranges set in Table 4.1. Record these values, since they may be for reference
     during future troubleshooting. NOTE: When determining comparison standards, U SLV
     should be used if radiometer is non-linear and a correction is added.
     4.4.11.5. Transmit a STATS message bringing the frequency back on the sun.
     4.4.11.6. Place all the paperwork from the linearity calibration (i.e., printouts, forms, etc)
     in a safe location for after-the-fact quality assurance (QA) and future reference.
     4.4.11.7. Some items to QA.

     4.4.11.7.1. The “TRUE (Y)” and “MEAS (X)” SFU values for the noise source-
     signal generator match were within 5 percent.
     4.4.11.7.2. The point where the Slave LIA went non-linear was analyzed correctly.
     4.4.11.7.3. The data points entered into the RIMS LINCAL program were correct.

                             RIMS IFLUX MEASUREMENTS

5.1. Theory.
   5.1.1. Noontime IFLUX measurements.
      5.1.1.1. IFLUX measurements will determine the quiet sun’s background output at radio
      wavelengths. This background radio emission, produced by the thermal motion of
      charged particles, is dependent on the sun’s temperature and density at the levels where it
      is produced. Measurements are made as close as practical to local noon to minimize the
      effect of atmospheric attenuation. Noontime measurements also provide a degree of
      standardization that permits meaningful comparison of IFLUX values over time at a
      given observatory, or between observatories. The noon IFLUX value measured on any
      particular frequency will vary with time due to atmospheric conditions, equipment
      performance, and changes in solar output. Flux values will increase or decrease over a
      time scale of several hours (e.g., large areas rotating on or off the Solar Disk), weeks
      (Slowly Varying Component), and months or years (11-year Solar Cycle).
      5.1.1.2. The noontime IFLUX measurement also represents a baseline against which
      solar radio bursts are measured. Of course, the baseline will need adjustments
      periodically throughout the observing day to allow for atmospheric attenuation and
      increasing or decreasing slowly varying component. Radio bursts are caused by
      transitory non-thermal radio energy released during solar flares or other disturbances in
      the solar atmosphere. Bursts represent radio output over-and-above the normal thermal
      background (or baseline) solar radio output at the time of the burst.
      5.1.1.3. IFLUX Reports. Make integrated radio flux measurements within plus or minus
      one hour of CMP, and as close as possible to CMP, IAW the procedures in this guidance.
      If unable to perform IFLUX while another site is on patrol, a split IFLUX is mandatory.
      When performing a split IFLUX, calibrate the 3 and 8 foot antennas together, and the 28
      foot antenna subsequently.
          5.1.1.3.1. Delay or perform the noon calibration early (within plus or minus 1 hour of
          CMP) when:
          5.1.1.3.2. No other radio site is on patrol (a split IFLUX is required).
          5.1.1.3.3. Normalize lights are out. Recommend not performing calibration if
          normalize lights are out and delaying IFLUX measurement until radio has been re-
          normalized. Performing calibration in this situation gives extremely erroneous
          readings. (Unless an IFLUX is imminent and maintenance has not yet arrived. In
          such a situation, proceed with caution).
          5.1.1.3.4. Radiometers are in their 1-hour stabilization period after a power outage.
          5.1.1.3.5. Solar radio burst activity is in progress, and fluctuating amplifier values
          indicate it's very unlikely that any representative baseline values will be produced.
          Baselines may fluctuate considerably and/or remain “superheated” for hours
          following very large bursts.

           5.1.1.3.6. When weather (i.e. heavy rain, thunderstorms, snow) is expected at CMP
           and attenuation would be minimized by delaying it or performing it early.
        5.1.1.4. If circumstance delays measurement beyond 1 hour after CMP, complete the
        IFLUX as soon as possible. Qualify any attenuated IFLUX values as uncertain due to
        weather (meaning atmospheric attenuation in this case). If the delay extends more than 3
        hours after CMP, do not perform an IFLUX measurement.
        5.1.1.5. To ensure data consistency, compare observed IFLUX values against the
        unqualified network average values IAW procedures in Chapter 3, Section 3.5.
   5.1.2. Magnitude of IFLUX values vary by frequency.
        5.1.2.1. The quiet sun (i.e., background) thermal radio output depends on the density of
        the portion of the solar atmosphere where it is produced. As altitude increases from the
        solar surface (photosphere), through the solar atmosphere (the chromosphere and corona),
        the density of particles undergoes a nearly steady decrease.
        5.1.2.2. The decrease in density with increasing altitude has two effects. First, it causes
        the frequency of radio energy produced at each level in the atmosphere (known as the
        “characteristic” frequency) to decrease as altitude increases. For example, the density
        near the sun’s surface produces radio energy near 35,000 MHz, while the density in the
        outer corona produces radio energy of a few MHz. Second, the decrease in density with
        altitude causes a decrease in the amount of radio energy produced, despite the general
        rise in temperature with altitude. Thus, measured IFLUX (or background) values
        decrease as altitude increases and frequency decreases. Table 5.1 shows the relationship
        between increasing altitude and decreasing “characteristic” frequency and IFLUX values.

   5.1.3. IFLUX values change slowly over time.
        5.1.3.1. Background Component. The majority of the energy that contributes to IFLUX
        values comes from the Background Component of solar radio emission. This component,
        produced by the thermal motion of free electrons throughout the solar atmosphere is
        fairly steady in quantity, but will vary during the course of the 11-year solar cycle. In
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                    43


      fact, its intensity is roughly 25 to 60 percent greater at sunspot maximum than at
      minimum.
      5.1.3.2. Slowly Varying Component (SVC). The SVC also contributes to the size of
      IFLUX values. Produced by the same thermal mechanism as the Background
      Component, SVC represents the extra thermal energy produced by active regions. These
      active regions, at any given level in the solar atmosphere, are hotter and (more
      importantly) denser than the general background sun outside active regions. So these
      active regions produce extra radio energy, adding to the Background Component’s
      contribution to measured IFLUX values. The SVC varies over a time scale of days-to-
      weeks as active regions grow and decay, or move across the visible face of the sun.
      Since these active regions are concentrated in the chromosphere, their contribution is
      most noticeable near 2800 MHz, but may be detectable in the range from about 600 to
      8000 MHz. Since the SVC is due to active regions, it is a greater contributor of energy
      near solar cycle maximum than near solar minimum. In fact, near solar maximum the
      intensity of the SVC contribution can equal that of the Background Component near 2800
      MHz. The baseline on 2695 MHz can actually become slightly higher than the baseline
      observed on 4995 MHz. Similarly, the baseline on 4995 MHz can approach, and
      sometimes even exceed, that observed on 8800 MHz.
5.2. IFLUX Measurement Procedures.
   5.2.1. Separate calibration of the 8 and 28 foot antennas is mandatory if no other radio site is
   on patrol. If a separate calibration (split IFLUX) is done, the 3 and 8-foot antennas should be
   calibrated together, and the 28-foot calibrated at another time.
   5.2.2. When conditions exist (e.g., site equipment problems, the site is the only one on
   patrol, solar activity is occurring or may occur) that delay the IFLUX measurement beyond
   one hour after CMP, complete the measurement as soon as possible. Qualify the IFLUX
   values as uncertain due to weather (meaning atmospheric attenuation in this case). If the
   delay extends more than 3 hours after CMP, do not perform an IFLUX measurement, and
   send out a PLAIN explaining the situation.
   5.2.3. If equipment problems or weather prevent acquiring IFLUX data on any frequency,
   omit that frequency from the IFLUX message. Append a PLAIN, if necessary, to explain the
   missing data. If no IFLUX data is obtainable on any frequency, send out a PLAIN
   explaining the situation.
   5.2.4. Use IFLUX qualifiers to identify uncertain data. If there is clearly no doubt that an
   IFLUX value is bad or useless, omit that frequency from the IFLUX message (e.g., a
   severely depressed value due to moisture in an antenna feed, or a highly elevated value due
   to RFI or a large burst.) As a rough guideline, a “bad” IFLUX value is one that differs by
   about 75 percent from its typical value. EXCEPTION: If the elevated IFLUX value is due
   to the enhanced continuous emission associated with a noise storm, transmit the measured
   IFLUX value qualified as uncertain due to a burst in progress.
   5.2.5. If there is doubt as to the accuracy of an IFLUX value, qualify it as unknown. Do not
   qualify an IFLUX value only because it differs from another site’s value. NOTE: The other
   site could be incorrect, or solar output may have undergone a significant change since the
   earlier measurement. Qualify an IFLUX value whenever:

     5.2.5.1. A noise storm is in progress on that frequency (regardless of how weak the noise
     storm peaks are).
     5.2.5.2. The baseline on that frequency is elevated (e.g., a gradual rise and fall burst).
     5.2.5.3. An impulsive solar burst, an equipment problem, RFI, or clouds may have
     affected the IFLUX measurement.
     5.2.5.4. Outside of 10% of network average for more than five days.
  5.2.6. “Standard IFLUX Drift”. Use this method as the primary means for acquiring an
  IFLUX reading.
     5.2.6.1. Move the antenna(s) being calibrated back on the sun.
     5.2.6.2. Select the IFLUX option from the Calibration pull down menu.
     5.2.6.3. Select the frequencies to be calibrated. NOTE: The IFLUX window displays
     the current baseline values in the column labeled Old Values.
     5.2.6.4. Select the “3 min drift” function on the Antenna Control Unit.
     5.2.6.5. Select the Start Collection button on the IFLUX window and allow the RIMS to
     read the sun’s output as it drifts across the antenna(s). Either minimize the IFLUX
     window or move it out of the way in order to see the signal strength rise on each of the
     frequencies.
     5.2.6.6. After the sun’s output passes its peak value on all frequencies, select the Finish
     Collection button on the IFLUX window. NOTE: Starting the drift with an excessively
     weak signal, or allowing the drift to run excessively beyond the maximum signal
     attained, only increases the chances of collecting RFI. The system will now display the
     peak value seen on each frequency in the column labeled New Values.
     5.2.6.7. If acceptable, all of the new IFLUX values can be selected by using the Select
     All button or individual values by placing a check under the appropriate frequencies.
     NOTE: The RIMS automatically selects all frequencies used in the drift.
     5.2.6.8. Use either the Save and Exit or Cancel button to close the IFLUX window
     without generating a message. Select Generate Message and Exit to bring up the IFLUX
     Message window. Select the quality of the IFLUX and issue the message.
  5.2.7. “Peak-IFLUX Drift”. Use this alternate method only when frequent RFI or solar radio
  burst activity makes it unlikely that accurate IFLUX values are attainable by the primary
  “Standard IFLUX Drift” reading method.
     5.2.7.1. Select the IFLUX option from the Calibration pull down menu.
     5.2.7.2. Select the frequencies to be calibrated.
     5.2.7.3. Move the antenna(s) being calibrated back onto the sun.
     5.2.7.4. Select the Start Collection button on the IFLUX window and allow the computer
     to take a one-minute sample reading.
     5.2.7.5. Select the Finish Collection button on the IFLUX window. The system will now
     display the peak value seen on each frequency in the column labeled New Values.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                               45


    5.2.7.6. Check if the IFLUX values obtained are reasonable by comparing them to the
    most recent IFLUX values available, acquired locally and from other sites. NOTE: A
    more detailed trend comparison against the network’s average values is required IAW the
    IFLUX standardization program in Chapter 3.
    5.2.7.7. If values appear too high or low by more than 10% against the network average,
    take another IFLUX reading. Use caution (especially at lower frequencies) as the sun
    may have increased or decreased output by more than 10% since the last IFLUX. Repeat
    the previous steps to accomplish another IFLUX measurement. NOTE: DO NOT take
    another measurement if continuous RFI, a noise storm, or weather was the cause of the
    high or low reading; just qualify the data appropriately. If, after another IFLUX reading,
    values are still out of tolerance, qualify the data as “unknown” and notify maintenance.
    5.2.7.8. If acceptable, all of the new IFLUX values can be selected by using the Select
    All button or individual values by placing a check under the appropriate frequencies.
    Values for all eight frequencies will already be selected if performing a complete IFLUX.
    5.2.7.9. Use the Generate Message and Exit button to bring up the IFLUX message
    screen. Ensure all values are correctly qualified. Once all items are acceptable issue
    message. There are two other options available to the analyst. Save the new IFLUX
    values without generating a message by using the Save button or use the Cancel button to
    close the IFLUX window not saving any of the values.
    5.2.7.10. When performing a split IFLUX, save the IFLUX values from the first part of
    the calibration without transmitting the message. After performing the second part,
    transmit a message containing all the IFLUX values.
    5.2.7.11. Put ACU on Solar track.
    5.2.7.12. Transmit STATS message bringing all applicable frequencies back on to the
    sun.

                                           Chapter 6

                  RIMS DISCRETE FREQUENCY BURST ANALYSIS

6.1. Theory.
   6.1.1. A disturbance in the solar atmosphere (such as a flare) produces radio burst energy by
   non-thermal mechanisms (e.g., high speed electrons spiraling around magnetic field lines).
   This transitory, non-thermal radio energy is detected by radiometers as extra solar output,
   over-and-above the background thermal (or baseline) radio output. Thus, to determine the
   amount of radio energy caused by a burst alone, it must be measured relative to the sun’s
   current background (or baseline) emission. An absolute flux measurement relative to zero
   SFUs (i.e., the background cold sky) is not wanted since it would include both the burst
   output and the solar background output.
   6.1.2. The frequency of radio energy produced by a disturbance in the solar atmosphere
   depends on the density of free electrons at that altitude. Since density generally decreases
   with increasing altitude, the frequency produced (known as the “characteristic” frequency)
   will also decrease (Table 5.1). By selecting a wide range of frequencies to monitor, the
   entire solar atmosphere from its base to the outer corona can be sampled. This sampling
   effectively produces a vertical sounding through the solar atmosphere, which assists
   forecasters and scientists in determining the nature of the causative disturbance.
   6.1.3. The density of free electrons at any given altitude in the solar atmosphere determines
   more than just what radio frequency is produced by a disturbance at that altitude. It also
   determines the range of frequencies to which that level is transparent. Each level reflects all
   radio energy at frequencies less than its “characteristic” frequency, and is transparent to all
   radio energy at higher frequencies. EXAMPLE: The density in the mid chromosphere
   produces radio energy near 4000 MHz. All radio energy produced below the mid
   chromosphere at greater than 4000 MHz can escape through the mid chromosphere, but all
   radio energy produced at less than 4000 MHz will be reflected back toward the sun’s surface.
6.2. Microwave Burst Classifications. Microwave (300 to 30,000 MHz) bursts are observed
using single (fixed) frequency RIMS radiometers. Microwave bursts vary considerably in
duration (from a fraction of a minute to over an hour), intensity (from a few SFUs to a quarter
million SFUs), and profile (from simple to complex). However, microwave bursts are grouped
in three broad classes: Impulsive, Gradual Rise and Fall, and Noise Storm.
   6.2.1. Impulsive Bursts.
       6.2.1.1. Impulsive bursts are further divided into four types according to intensity and
       profile.
          6.2.1.1.1. “IMPULSIVE” = Intensity less than 500 SFUs; only one peak. (BURST
          code type U=3.)
          6.2.1.1.2. “COMPLEX” = Intensity less than 500 SFUs; one or more secondary
          peaks. (BURST Code type U=4).
          6.2.1.1.3. “GREAT BURST” = Intensity 500 SFUs or greater; only one peak.
          (BURST Code type U=5).
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                47


         6.2.1.1.4. “COMPLEX GREAT” = Intensity 500 SFUs or greater; one or more
         secondary peaks. (BURST Code type U=6).
      6.2.1.2. Definitions. A “complex” burst profile displays a primary (highest) peak and
      one or more secondary peak(s). A “secondary” peak has an amplitude of at least 10%
      (but not less than 100 SFUs) of the highest peak and is separated from the highest peak
      by at least two minutes (Figure 6.1).
      6.2.1.3. Characteristics.
         6.2.1.3.1. Impulsive bursts are normally associated with the sudden flash phase of a
         flare. The radio energy is produced by flare-accelerated electrons spiraling about
         magnetic field lines in a field of several thousand gauss. This non-thermal
         mechanism can produce very intense, but generally brief, releases of radio energy.
         Complex bursts will typically be associated with the larger flares, often those with
         multiple eruptive centers.
         6.2.1.3.2. The rise to maximum intensity normally occurs in about a minute or less,
         and peaks at different frequencies almost simultaneously. The decay to pre-flare
         intensity is more gradual than the rise, and may take a few tens of minutes, or even
         hours. Complex bursts tend to have longer durations and be more intense, but less
         common, than simple profile bursts.
      6.2.1.4. Spectral Group definition. Multiple frequency bursts form a “spectral group” if
      peaks on each frequency fall within a two minute window beginning with the first peak in
      the group (Figure 6.2). The first peak in the group does not have to be the largest peak,
      nor do the peaks used to group the frequencies have to be the largest peaks on each
      frequency. All bursts in a spectral group should be reported, even those with peaks of
      less than 100 SFUs. Normally all the discrete frequencies involved should be reported in
      a single message, with the same local burst serial number. However, if a spectral burst
      starts very close to the end of the Zulu day, the start time on some frequencies may be
      just before 2400Z, while on other frequencies it may be just after 0000Z. In such a case,
      prepare and transmit separate BURST code messages, since the BURST code does not
      allow inclusion of data for more than one Zulu day in a single message.

       6.2.1.5. Castelli U definition: If a “spectral group” of bursts meets the criteria below, it
       is labeled a Castelli U (BURST code type T=9). Figure 6.3 shows a Castelli U burst
       group. A Castelli U signature is believed to be indicative of a proton producing flare.

Figure 6.3. Castelli-U Spectral Burst.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  49


          6.2.1.5.1. A peak of 1000 SFUs or greater on one of the upper three frequencies
          (4995 through 15,400 MHz).
          6.2.1.5.2. A peak of 1000 SFUs or greater on one of the lower three frequencies (245
          through 610 MHz).
          6.2.1.5.3. A pronounced dip in the middle frequency peaks.
          6.2.1.5.4. A start-to-peak integrated flux of 100,000 SFU-seconds or greater at 8800
          MHz.
          6.2.1.5.5. All peaks used in defining the Castelli-U must fall within a two-minute
          window.
   6.2.2. Gradual Rise and Fall Bursts (GRF).
      6.2.2.1. A GRF burst (BURST code type U=2) is the only type of radio burst produced
      by a thermal mechanism, which explains why GRFs tend not to be very intense, but can
      last for hours. During a GRF, magnetic fields in an active region distort, compressing
      and heating charged particles. These particles increase their thermal radio output (the
      gradual rise). As the magnetic fields later relax and release the compressed particles, the
      thermal output declines (the gradual fall). Thus a GRF differs from the SVC only in its
      shorter time scale (a few tens of minutes to several hours for a GRF, compared to days to
      weeks for the SVC).
      6.2.2.2. Characteristics.
          6.2.2.2.1. GRF bursts rise at a slow (non-impulsive) rate, then decline slowly to the
          normal quiet sun (baseline) level. Their profiles are generally very smooth (Figure
          6.4).

Figure 6.4. Gradual Rise and Fall Burst.




          6.2.2.2.2. The peak flux is normally less than 100 SFUs. GRF bursts should be
          reported even when their peaks are less than 100 SFUs, since they are positively
          correlated with soft X-rays and disappearing filaments. The onset of a GRF is often
          difficult to detect. Analysis of a suspected GRF burst will frequently require re-
          analysis of data over a wide time period.
          6.2.2.2.3. GRF bursts often occur on several adjacent frequencies simultaneously,
          producing a “spectral group”.
          6.2.2.2.4. Due to the long duration of a GRF burst, it is not uncommon for other
          microwave bursts to be superimposed on a GRF. Analyze superimposed bursts
          relative to the GRF output, not the pre-GRF baseline, since a superimposed burst
 50                                                   AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


           represents radio energy output over and above both the normal background solar
           output and the enhanced GRF output.
   6.2.3. Noise Storms.
       6.2.3.1. Noise storms (BURST code type U=1) originate in the upper portions of the
       solar atmosphere, where disturbances produce low frequency radio energy (Table 5.1).
       On discrete frequency RIMS radiometers, noise storms are detected at 245 and 410 MHz,
       and sometimes as high as 610 MHz. On a SRS, they would be detected as a Continuum.
       6.2.3.2. Characteristics.
           6.2.3.2.1. Noise storms normally have two components. The first is a slowly
           varying, enhanced continuous emission over and above the usual quiet sun baseline
           for a frequency. The second is an irregular series of numerous, closely spaced, spiked
           peaks (Figure 6.5). Noise storm peaks are measured relative to the pre-storm
           baseline, so that they will include both the enhanced continuous emission and the
           spiked components.

Figure 6.5. Noise Storm on 245 MHz.




(The dashed line indicates a flux level several times that of the quiet sun.)
           6.2.3.2.2. In the frequency range from 30 to 300 MHz, the intensity of the enhanced
           noise storm continuous emission can occasionally be many times the normal
           background (or baseline) on a discrete frequency. The intensity of noise storm spiked
           peaks rarely exceeds about 1000 to 1200 SFUs, as measured relative to the pre-storm
           baseline. For this reason, a noise storm peak related RAD05 and RAD11 options of
           the EVENT code are likely to never apply. For that rare noise storm that does have
           peaks, which reach or exceed 5000 SFUs, report every occurrence of 5000 SFUs or
           more by a preliminary burst message.
           6.2.3.2.3. Noise storms can last from several hours to several days. Due to their long
           duration, it is common for other microwave bursts to be superimposed on a noise
           storm. Analyze superimposed bursts relative to the noise storm enhanced baseline,
           since a superimposed burst represents radio energy output over and above both the
           normal background solar output and the enhanced noise storm continuous output.
6.3. Tolerance and Burst Analysis.
   6.3.1. The burst start and end times and the mean and integrated flux computations, depend
   strongly on the burst threshold. (They also depend on site-to-site differences in equipment
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                     51


   performance and observing conditions). A burst threshold setting of about 100 SFUs is
   strongly recommended to ensure consistency between observatories in reported burst times
   and fluxes, set threshold at 100 percent over baseline for 2695 MHz.
   6.3.2. An analyst may need to temporarily set the burst threshold higher than the
   recommended 100 SFUs to maintain effective radio patrol. Some circumstances under which
   this may be true include:
       6.3.2.1. When RFI or noise storm activity is in progress, an analyst should set the burst
       threshold at a value that will avoid frequent false or unneeded computer generated
       BURST code messages.
       6.3.2.2. When a burst is taking a long time to decline back to the pre-burst baseline,
       raising the burst threshold temporarily to force the computer to end the burst will free the
       analysis program for detection of subsequent bursts. During periods of frequent solar
       radio activity, keeping the analysis program free can save an analyst considerable time
       running burst reanalysis programs.
           6.3.2.2.1. If a new burst occurs on a frequency where the analysis program is still
           analyzing the tail end of an earlier burst, the analysis program will assume the second
           burst is part of the first burst. The computer generated BURST message that results
           will be unusable, and the analyst will need to reanalyze both bursts.
           6.3.2.2.2. During a multi-frequency burst, the analysis program can end the burst on
           each frequency separately. If the analyst has declared a noise storm, any peaks
           generated will show up as noise storm peaks. However, when activity on the
           frequency in question has been elevated for an extended period of time, the RIMS
           analysis software would then determine that a super-imposed burst is occurring. It
           will then suspend the Noise Storm program and generate a burst. When activity on
           the frequency subsides, the Noise Storm is automatically reinstated and only noise
           storm activity is reported.
6.4. Impulsive and GRF Burst Parameters. The parameters below are used to describe
impulsive and gradual rise and fall bursts. Because of the character, duration, and intensity of
noise storms, some of their parameters must be defined differently from other microwave bursts
in paragraph 6.5.
   6.4.1. Start Time.
       6.4.1.1. The time, to the nearest tenth of a minute, when the burst first meets or exceeds
       the burst threshold level. For example, if the burst threshold is set at 100 SFUs, start time
       will be when the trace (activity) meets or exceeds 100 SFUs.
       6.4.1.2. See paragraph 6.3 for a discussion of the role played by burst threshold in the
       burst analysis program.
       6.4.1.3. The analysis program collects raw data from eight of the system’s sixteen
       amplifiers every one second. To initially detect a burst, the analysis program examines
       the 1-second flux data values within a sampling, and selects the minimum value from the
       block. It then compares the minimum value against the burst threshold. If the minimum
       value is above the burst threshold, and the minimum value from the sampling was also
       above the burst threshold, the analysis program declares a burst start. NOTE: The
52                                                   AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


     analysis program filters out RFI spikes by requiring the minimum values exceed the burst
     threshold in two successive samplings. Use extreme caution as the analysis program may
     filter out event level bursts that are extremely spikey. This will normally occur on the
     lower frequencies. Burst start time is set as the start of the sampling, even if the analysis
     program used the last of the sampling to declare the burst.
  6.4.2. Peak Time. The time, to the nearest tenth of a minute, when the burst reaches its
  maximum deflection or intensity.
  6.4.3. End Time.
     6.4.3.1. The time, to the nearest tenth of a minute, when the enhancement falls below the
     burst threshold and remains below that level for 2 minutes.
         6.4.3.1.1. To end a burst, the analysis program examines the 1-second flux data
         values within a sampling, and selects the minimum value from the block. It then
         compares the minimum value against the burst threshold. If the minimum value is
         below the burst threshold plus 4 SFUs, and the minimum values from the last 20
         consecutive samplings were also below this value, the analysis program declares an
         end to the burst. The end time of the burst is set at 120 seconds before the start of the
         20th sampling of data. The analysis program will end the burst independently on
         each frequency involved. Be careful not to miss activity that re-develops on certain
         (normally lower) frequencies. The analysis program may end the burst on particular
         frequencies, while burst activity is still in progress on other frequencies.
         6.4.3.1.2. When the enhancement doesn’t return to the pre-burst level, the analyst
         will need to make a judgment call as to when to end the burst on each frequency
         involved (see the guidelines below for manual end time). A burst can be manually
         ended, on one or more frequencies, by using the Generate and Clear button in the
         Graph Dialog Box, which will generate a BURST code message for all affected
         frequencies. The Clear button located under each frequency in the Graph Dialog
         Box, will automatically end the burst and generate a BURST code message for the
         selected frequency(ies). To clear out all data without generating a BURST code
         message use the Clear All Bursts button located in the Graph Dialog Box.
     6.4.3.2. Manual End Time.
         6.4.3.2.1. The time, to the nearest tenth of a minute, when the burst enhancement
         returns to the pre-burst (background) level for a minimum of 12 seconds. When the
         enhancement doesn’t return to the pre-burst level, the analyst will need to make a
         judgment call as to when to end the burst on each frequency involved. Some
         guidelines include:
            6.4.3.2.1.1. End the burst when the enhancement does not fluctuate by more than
            about 5 SFUs within any 2-minute period, or by more than about 5% of its
            maximum peak value for a 5-minute period. NOTE: This guideline can’t be
            applied on a frequency that has a noise storm in progress.
            6.4.3.2.1.2. End the current burst (on all the frequencies involved) if the
            enhancements have decreased to a level of about 10% of their maximum peaks
            and a clearly new, significant burst occurs on any of the frequencies involved.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   53


             CAUTION: Exercise care in distinguishing between a single complex burst and
             several separate bursts. The end time of the preceding burst and the start time of
             the following burst will be the same, i.e., the time when the rise of the second
             burst was first discernible.
  6.4.4. Burst Peak.
     6.4.4.1. Identification. Only the largest, or maximum, peak for a burst is reported.
     Secondary peaks, as defined in paragraph 6.2, are only used to determine burst
     classification, i.e., whether the burst has a simple or complex profile. The maximum
     peak will not be known for certain until a burst has ended, so preliminary BURST code
     reports contain the highest peak observed on each frequency up to the time the report was
     prepared.
     6.4.4.2. Analysis.
         6.4.4.2.1. After a burst start is declared, the analysis program monitors the 1-second
         flux data values within each sampling, and selects the largest value from the
         sampling. It then compares the largest value against the previously stored largest
         value. If the new value is higher, a new maximum peak is established. The peak time
         is set at the start of the applicable sampling. The analysis program also analyzes for
         secondary peaks to identify complex versus simple bursts.
  6.4.5. Mean Flux. The mean flux is the average burst intensity (in SFU) for the duration of
  the burst.
     6.4.5.1. The mean flux is computed by the analysis program based on its measurements
     of flux readings, and its determination of burst start and end times. NOTE: If an analyst
     manually alters the burst times or peak flux, it will be necessary to manually re-compute
     the mean flux.
  6.4.6. Integrated Flux. Integrated flux is the total burst radio energy (expressed as solar flux
  units seconds, SFU-sec) received on a particular discrete frequency. It is equal to the area
  under the burst time-intensity profile (Figure 6.6). However, all analysts must be capable of
  calculating integrated fluxes in order to evaluate bursts for Castelli-U criteria or to meet
  requests from forecast centers for this data during large bursts.
     6.4.6.1. Manual “Mean Flux” Method. Manually determine start-to-end integrated flux
     by multiplying the mean flux (in SFUs) by the burst duration (in seconds). (See Figure
     6.6.)
 54                                                   AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


Figure 6.6. Integrated Flux “Mean Flux” Method.




(Integrated flux, shaded area, in SFU-sec equals mean flux in SFUs multiplied by the burst
duration in seconds.)
       6.4.6.2. The start-to-peak and start-to-end integrated fluxes are computed by the analysis
       program based on its measurements of flux readings, and its determination of burst start,
       peak, and end times.
          6.4.6.2.1. The values computed by the analysis program strongly depend on the burst
          threshold. They can also differ significantly from manually computed values due to
          the inaccuracies involved in manual methods and the manner in which the analysis
          program determines the start and end times for bursts.
          6.4.6.2.2. If an analyst manually alters the burst times or peak flux, depending on
          what data was changed, it may be necessary to encode the integrated flux groups as
          7//// and 9////, or to re-compute these fluxes.
6.5. Noise Storm Burst Parameters. Because of the character, duration, and intensity of noise
storms, some of their parameters must be defined differently than for other microwave bursts.
Noise storms are reportable only during that period when they are producing peaks of 100 SFUs
or more, relative to the pre-storm baseline.
   6.5.1. Start Time. The time when rough, spikey activity first reached or exceeded 100 SFUs.
   If a noise storm was found to be in progress at sunrise, the start time will be the time patrol
   was started. The first few spikes may also be confused with RFI, but as the storm persists
   and increases in intensity, identification will become easier. After identification, backdate
   the start time to include the earliest activity that reached 100 SFUs.
   6.5.2. Peak Time. The time, to the nearest tenth of a minute, when the noise storm’s
   maximum peak intensity was reached. Noise storm peaks are measured relative to the pre-
   storm baseline, so that they will include both the enhanced continuous emission and the
   spiked components. The RSTN Daily Activity Log provides a location to log the pre-storm
   baseline value for ready reference. If a noise storm began overnight, use the previous day’s
   IFLUX value for a pre-storm baseline value. EXAMPLE: On day one, a noise storm began
   on 245 MHz. The quiet sun (pre-storm) baseline was 15 SFUs. By day two, the baseline on
   245 MHz has become elevated to 240 SFUs. A 600 SFU peak just occurred.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                    55


       6.5.2.1. If the peak is determined to be a noise storm peak, it would be a 585 SFU burst.
       The reason is the peak value (600 SFUs) minus the pre-storm baseline (15 SFUs) equals
       585 SFUs.
       6.5.2.2. If the peak is determined to be a superimposed burst (e.g., not typical of recent
       noise storm peaks, or coincides with peaks on other frequencies, see paragraph 6.6.) it
       would be a 360 SFU burst. The peak value (600 SFUs) minus the elevated pre-burst
       background (240 SFUs) equals 360 SFUs. NOTE: Superimposed bursts are analyzed
       relative to the noise storm enhanced baseline, since they represent radio energy output
       over and above both the normal background solar output and the enhanced noise storm
       continuous output.
   6.5.3. Successively higher noise storm peaks should be reported as they occur, using an
   updated preliminary BURST code message.
   6.5.4. Noise storm peaks rarely exceed 1200 SFUs relative to the pre-storm baseline. For
   this reason a noise storm related EVENT code RAD05 and RAD11 options are likely to
   never apply. For that rare noise storm, which does have peaks that reach or exceed 5000
   SFUs, report every peak that does so with an event level SXXX MANOP header preliminary
   BURST code message. When a noise storm peak reaches 5000 SFUs and it is less than an
   earlier peak, it is inappropriate to transmit an updated preliminary noise storm BURST code
   message.
   6.5.5. End Time. The time when rough, spiky activity last reached or exceeded 100 SFUs.
   If a noise storm is still in progress at sunset, the end time will be the time patrol was ended.
   Towards its end, a noise storm will normally fade out gradually. Avoid ending a noise storm
   prematurely. Monitor the activity for about 30 to 45 minutes to ensure it doesn’t re-intensify.
   If peaks remain below 100 SFUs, end the storm using the last time a peak reached 100 SFUs
   or more.
   6.5.6. If a noise storm is observed on more than one discrete frequency (e.g., 245 and 410
   MHz), report them as separate noise storms, with separate burst numbers. This will make it
   possible to end the noise storm on one frequency while it is still in progress on another.
   6.5.7. Do not report mean flux or integrated fluxes for noise storms. Instead, encode the
   mean flux as “000” and the integrated fluxes as “////”.
6.6. Superimposed Bursts. Report a superimposed burst separately from a noise storm, a
gradual rise and fall burst, or the tail end of another impulsive burst. Guidance on analyzing
solar radio bursts that occur simultaneously with a satellite RFI elevated baseline is provided in
paragraph 6.9.1.4.
   6.6.1. Identification Guidelines. Assume a burst peak is part of a superimposed burst if:
       6.6.1.1. The peak corresponds exactly in time (to the nearest tenth of a minute) with one
       or more other discrete frequency burst peaks, or with the onset of sweep activity.
       6.6.1.2. The peak’s intensity is more than twice that of the average noise storm peaks
       during the preceding 10 minutes and it remains so for 30 seconds or more. The intensity
       of the peak is not typical of recent noise storm peaks. Also, noise storm peaks have very
       narrow time duration, normally less than 5 to 10 seconds, so a longer duration peak
       implies a non-noise storm origin. (Figure 6.7.)

   6.6.2. Superimposed Burst Parameters. Analyze superimposed bursts relative to the current,
   enhanced background, since such bursts represent solar radio energy output over and above
   both the normal background solar output and the enhanced output from the other burst.
   Superimposed burst detection and analysis is very difficult for the computer, so most data
   will require some manual analysis. If appropriate, qualify the superimposed burst as
   uncertain data due to interference.
       6.6.2.1. Start Time. The time, to the nearest tenth of a minute, when the burst can first
       be differentiated from the underlying burst or surrounding noise storm peaks.
       6.6.2.2. Peak Flux. The maximum peak flux observed during the superimposed burst,
       minus the current, enhanced background output due to both the quiet sun and the other
       burst.
       6.6.2.3. End Time. The time, to the nearest tenth of a minute, when the burst returns to
       the (enhanced) background level for a minimum of 12 seconds. When the burst doesn’t
       return to the background level, end the burst IAW guidance provided in paragraph 6.4.3.

6.7. Burst Attenuation Corrections. Discrete frequency bursts observed near sunrise or
sunset, or during thick clouds or precipitation, may require correction for the amount of radio
signal that was attenuated. An attenuation correction is required for all bursts on discrete
frequencies where the current baseline has dropped to more than 10 percent below either the
most recent IFLUX value (for sunrise or sunset bursts) or the pre-attenuation baseline (for
weather attenuation).
   6.7.1. The reanalysis program can give good results when used to analyze bursts when the
   attenuated baseline is within 10% of the previous good baseline. This is accomplished by
   adjusting the baseline on the reanalysis program to the current (attenuated) baseline, and
   analyzing normally. This method will correct for peak, mean, and integrated flux.
   6.7.2. If the baseline is off from the pre-attenuated baseline by more than 10%, follow the
   steps outlined in 6.7.2.1 below to perform a manual attenuation correction.
       6.7.2.1. Steps to manually apply an attenuation correction.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                    57


           6.7.2.1.1. Determine pre-attenuations baseline. This will either be the last good
           IFLUX or pre-attenuation baseline.
           6.7.2.1.2. Divide current baseline into pre-attenuation baseline to obtain a flux ratio.
           If the attenuation has affected the frequency since sunrise, use the previous day’s flux
           value. The ratio will be greater than 1.00.
           6.7.2.1.3. Multiply the burst’s observed peak by the flux ratio to get the corrected
           peak flux.
           6.7.2.1.4. Use the corrected peak flux to compute the mean and integrated flux.
           6.7.2.1.5. Qualify the burst appropriately.
   6.7.3. Apply attenuation corrections to all burst peak and mean flux values. If time permits,
   also apply corrections to integrated flux values. Otherwise, report these groups as “7////” and
   “9////”, since these values can be computed later from start, peak, and end times and mean
   flux data in the BURST message.
6.8. Burst Linearity Corrections. During large discrete frequency bursts, flux values may
require a correction if they lie within the non-linear response portion of the radiometers. The
RIMS analysis software will automatically apply any required linearity correction to peak, mean,
and integrated flux values. The same is true for the reanalysis program.
6.9. Radio Frequency Interference (RFI).
   6.9.1. RFI is usually a short-lived, narrow-band phenomenon. The more common forms of
   RFI are:
       6.9.1.1. Radar Interference. Very narrow high intensity spikes, often in regulated time
       intervals showing a dominant periodicity are usually due to radar. This form of RFI is
       usually confined to a single frequency (typically, although not always at 8800 MHz).
       Likely sources are ships and planes.
       6.9.1.2. Television Interference. TV interference occurs when a television station
       broadcasts at a frequency adjacent to a radiometer frequency, and “leaks over” into the
       radiometer band. This type of RFI signal is very similar to solar fluctuations in
       appearance. Television interference is most likely on the lower RSTN frequencies,
       because TV transmissions are in the VHF band (channels 2-6, 54 to 88 MHz; and
       channels 7-13, 174 to 216 MHz) and UHF band (channels 14-83, 470 to 980 MHz).
       6.9.1.3. Thunderstorms. Random discharges of electricity within a thunderstorm can
       cause spiked, broadband RFI, usually at the lower frequencies. Sudden power
       fluctuations resulting from nearby lightning strikes sometimes cause broadband effects,
       which can resemble solar radio bursts. Antenna pointing direction can make a dramatic
       difference as to whether or not lightning is even detected.
       6.9.1.4. Satellite Interference.
           6.9.1.4.1. Geosynchronous satellite transponders can raise the baseline by as much as
           several hundred-flux units for some tens of minutes to hours. This type of RFI will
           usually occur during roughly the same time period each day. Geostationary
           interference will normally change seasonally, and may show up at the same time on
           the same frequency year after year. The RFI will often resemble a gradual rise and
58                                                     AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


         fall burst, and any solar radio bursts will be seen superimposed on top of the elevated
         baseline caused by the interference.
         6.9.1.4.2. Polar Orbiting satellites will show a distinctly different RFI signature.
         They normally pass between the dish and the sun for only a short time (typically 1-3
         minutes) and will display a perfectly symmetrical RFI pattern. Any simultaneous
         solar radio bursts will be superimposed on top of the elevated symmetrical baseline
         trace.
         6.9.1.4.3. Solar radio bursts which occur simultaneously with satellite RFI should be
         analyzed relative to the current, enhanced baseline, i.e., in the same manner as an
         impulsive burst that is superimposed on a solar radio noise storm, a gradual rise and
         fall burst, or the tail end of another impulsive burst described in paragraph 6.6. The
         reason is that a radiometer cannot distinguish between signals of solar and non-solar
         origin. In both cases, all the radio energy received, regardless of its origin, will be
         added. The superimposed solar burst will represent radio energy from the satellite.
         The solar burst should be qualified uncertain data due to interference.
     6.9.1.5. Local Interference.
         6.9.1.5.1. RFI generated within the observatory complex can be broadband and very
         difficult to diagnose. Historically, the leading causes have been electric motors with
         bad brushes and dirty switches or solenoids. There are electric motors running all the
         cooling fans in the RSTN equipment, as well as the air compressor.
         6.9.1.5.2. Citizen band radio transmissions may cause exceptionally erratic RFI if a
         mike is keyed anywhere in the vicinity of the receiving dishes. Arc welding or metal
         grinding are also prime causes of RFI. Aircraft avionics (radar altimeters, weather
         radar, etc) and shipboard systems, as well as automobile/motorcycle ignition systems,
         may also cause RFI, which may last several minutes and then disappear.
  6.9.2. If in doubt as to the origin of any burst activity, treat it as solar and qualify the report
  appropriately. Distinguishing RFI from solar activity can be difficult. The following
  suggestions are offered:
     6.9.2.1. Adjacent RSTN site confirmation (if possible, during overlap patrol) is the
     primary means of distinguishing suspicious solar activity from RFI. Any burst of
     significance (>100sfu) will normally be received at another observatory unless
     attenuation or RFI is causing problems.
     6.9.2.2. Know the frequency and broadcasting times of local radio, television and radar
     transmitters in the area. Information on many radio and television transmitters is
     contained in the World Radio TV Handbook, an annual publication of Billboard
     Publications, Inc.
     6.9.2.3. RFI is usually narrow-band and extremely spikey. It will rarely be spectral (i.e.,
     multi-frequency) in appearance.
     6.9.2.4. May be able to correlate genuine bursts with optical or x-ray activity.
     6.9.2.5. Determine if thunderstorms are in the local area, or whether electrical
     equipment, poorly running vehicles, CB radios, etc., are being operated nearby.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                    59


  6.9.3. Data archive correction for RFI-induced bursts.
     6.9.3.1. If a significant radio burst is reported as solar activity but later determined to be
     RFI, and it is too late to COR the burst message, a correction must be made to the
     National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) database. Per AFWAI 15-2, section 3.2,
     RIMS data is archived monthly at RSTN sites and sent to NGDC no later than 30 days
     following the last day of the record month.
     6.9.3.2. Authorization must be given by 2 WS/DO before contacting NGDC to request a
     formal change to solar data archives. NOTE: do not send any correction requests to
     NGDC unless they have had adequate time to receive and process the monthly data
     archive package.
     6.9.3.3. The detachment commander or NCOIC will contact NGDC Solar and Terrestrial
     Physics Division via email at solar@noaa.gov and request the RFI burst to be stricken
     from the data archives. Include the AXXX71 or SXXX61 burst message. Identify the
     date, time (GMT), and frequencies affected. It is especially important to specify the
     entire duration of the burst, not just peak time.
     6.9.3.4. Detachment leadership will continue to work with NGDC Solar and Terrestrial
     Physics Division until the data archives have been satisfactorily adjusted.

                             SRS SWEEP BURST ANALYSIS

7.1. Swept Frequency Burst Classifications.
   7.1.1. Figure 7.1 shows a typical swept frequency spectrum for a large flare, as it would
   appear on a SRS sensitive to the 10 to 30,000 MHz frequency range. Individual flares will
   produce many variations to this typical spectrum. All swept frequency burst types originate
   from non-thermal radio energy production mechanisms. In Figure 7.1, the Type II, Type III,
   and Type IV sweeps show a time-frequency slope or “forward drift”, i.e., frequency
   decreases with passing time. The forward drift is caused by charged particles ejected by a
   flare into the solar atmosphere. As the particles move upward, they produce radio emission
   at (or above) the frequency characteristic of the altitude where they are located at a given
   instant. As shown in Table 5.1, this characteristic frequency decreases with increasing
   altitude. The result: as time passes, the altitude of the flare ejection increases and the
   (excited) frequency emitted decreases, causing the forward drift.
   7.1.2. Type III Sweeps.
      7.1.2.1. Type III sweeps are caused by packets of free electrons, which are ejected at
      high speed (0.2 to 0.8 times the speed of light) into the corona. These packets are usually
      produced during the flash (or impulsive) phase of a flare, and tend to move outward along
      open magnetic field lines. As these packets move upward, they produce radio energy at
      the successively lower frequencies characteristic of the altitudes through which they pass.
      However, the forward drift nature of these bursts is not noticeable on the SRS because of
      the extremely high speed at which the packets pass through the solar atmosphere. Thus
      Type III sweeps appear to have a simultaneous onset at all frequencies detected by the
      SRS.
      7.1.2.2. Individual Type III bursts normally only last a short duration, but they normally
      occur in closely packed groups that may continue for several minutes. In addition, these
      groups may form series of Type III sweeps extending over tens of minutes. For reporting
      purposes, one or more bursts over a period of less than 10 minutes constitutes a single
      Type III sweep.
   7.1.3. Type V Sweeps.
      7.1.3.1. Type V emission appears as a broadband, brief continuum lasting about 1 to 3
      minutes after a Type III sweep. When packets of free electrons are ejected upward into
      the corona, most of the electrons move outward along open magnetic field lines causing
      Type III bursts. Occasionally, some electrons are injected into closed magnetic field loop
      structures where they are temporarily trapped. These electrons have a relatively wide
      spatial distribution, and so produce broad frequency band continuum emission until they
      lose their energy and dissipate into the rest of the solar atmosphere.
      7.1.3.2. Less than 20 percent of Type III sweeps are followed by Type V emission. For
      reporting purposes, we define a Type V sweep as one or more bursts over a period of less
      than 10 minutes (may include some pure Type III bursts).
   7.1.4. Type II Sweeps.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 61


     7.1.4.1. After the flash phase (which causes Type III, Type V, and impulsive microwave
     bursts), a large flare may eject a cloud of charged particles (protons and electrons)
     outward through the corona. Since this “plasma” cloud is more massive than the packets
     of free electrons that cause Type III bursts, it moves outward more slowly (typically at
     about 500 to 2000 kilometers per second). This speed is still nearly ten times that of
     sound in the corona, so the moving plasma cloud generates a supersonic shockwave. As
     this shockwave moves outward, it produces radio energy at the successively lower
     frequencies characteristic of the altitudes through which it passes. The result is a slow,
     forward drift Type II swept frequency burst.
     7.1.4.2. Roughly half of Type II sweeps are observed to have a second harmonic, i.e., the
     shockwave produces radio energy emission at the characteristic frequency (primary) and
     at roughly twice that frequency (harmonic).
     7.1.4.3. Determine shock speed and encode IAW AFMAN 15-124. Append a PLAIN to
     indicate the degree of variability. EXAMPLE: “REPORTED SHOCK SPEED PLUS
     OR MINUS XXX KM/S”, where XXX is the accuracy of the encoded shock speed. This
     operation is performed automatically by SRS. The shock speed will be used to forecast
     the onset of delayed effects on radar, communications, and space systems.
  7.1.5. Type IV Continuum Sweeps.
     7.1.5.1. A Type IV sweep is broadband, long-duration continuum emission, normally
     associated with a large flare. The same plasma cloud whose shockwave may cause a
     Type II sweep produces it. However, the source of a Type IV sweep is the plasma in the
     cloud itself. The highly ionized plasma cloud drags along with it a portion of the
     magnetic field from the immediate vicinity of the flare. This field prevents free electrons
     (which are moving at an appreciable fraction of the speed of light) from quickly diffusing
     away. These high-energy electrons spiral about the magnetic field lines in the cloud and
     produce broadband radio frequency emissions.
     7.1.5.2. Not all Type IV continuums are preceded by a Type II, nor are all Type II
     sweeps followed by a Type IV. However, there is a close correlation between the two.
     NOTE: When they occur together, a Type II will occur before, or coincide with the start
     of, a Type IV. The Type IV will not precede the Type II unless two plasma clouds were
     emitted and the Type II was associated with the second cloud. Although such complex or
     double events are rare, they do occur.
     7.1.5.3. Type IV sweeps have a forward drift frequency-time slope, with about the same
     drift rate as the associated Type II sweep (Figure 7.1). The plasma cloud produces radio
     energy over a very wide band of frequencies simultaneously. However, which
     frequencies are able to escape (to be observed at the earth) depends on the characteristic
     frequency at each altitude in the solar atmosphere. As the cloud moves outward through
     the corona, the escape (or characteristic) frequency gets lower. Any radio energy with a
     frequency at or higher than the characteristic frequency will escape, accounting for the
     broadband continuum emission. Any radio energy with a frequency lower than the
     characteristic frequency is reflected back into the cloud. NOTE: This situation is
     significantly different from Type II and Type III bursts, where only disturbing the
     surrounding corona produces the characteristic frequency, or its harmonic.
 62                                                   AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


       7.1.5.4. The intensity maximum for a Type IV is generally reached about 10 to 30
       minutes after the beginning of the event. The initial plasma cloud that causes a Type IV
       sweep normally lasts only ten minutes to about two hours. However, the Type IV
       Continuum may last for several hours to several days. The long duration is caused by
       particles, which are lost through diffusion by the outward moving cloud or which fall
       back to the lower corona. These particles, trapped in closed magnetic field structures and
       spread over a wide range of altitudes, continue to produce radio energy over a wide range
       of frequencies, resulting in a broadband, long-duration continuum.
       7.1.5.5. Statistically, the larger the source flares, the more likely a Type IV sweep will
       occur and the longer it will last. In fact, about 60 percent of Type IV sweeps are
       associated with flares of Importance 3 or greater.
   7.1.6. Type 8 Continuum Sweeps.
       7.1.6.1. Type 8 (decameter) continuums are caused by stationary storm centers found in
       the corona and occur in the frequency range of the SRS. They can also be detected as
       “noise storms” on the lower discrete frequency RIMS radiometers.
       7.1.6.2. Type 8 continuum storms can last from several hours to several days. Due to
       their long duration, it is common for other burst activity to be superimposed on the storm
       continuums. In the case of the Type 8 Continuum, flare related Type II, Type IV, Type
       III, and/or Type V sweeps are often superimposed. NOTE: Flare Type III and Type V
       sweeps will typically be more intense, and cover a wider frequency range, than the Type
       8’s decameter Type III sweeps. The flare Type III and Type V sweeps should be
       analyzed and reported separately from the Type 8 sweep.
       7.1.6.3. Type 8 continuum storms are positively correlated with large sunspot groups and
       active surge regions, because the intense magnetic fields associated with large sunspots
       extend outward into the corona and produce conditions favorable to continuum storms.
       Near solar cycle maximum, continuum storms may be in progress roughly 10 percent of
       the time.
   7.1.7. Type 6 Sweeps. A series of Type III bursts over a period of 10 minutes or more, with
   no period longer than 30 minutes without activity.
   7.1.8. Type 7 Sweeps. A series of Type III and Type V bursts over a period of 10 minutes or
   more, with no period longer than 30 minutes without activity.
7.2. Sweep Intensities.
   7.2.1. The intensity of swept frequency bursts (“importance”) depend as much on local
   equipment performance and observing conditions (weather, sun elevation, etc), as on the
   intrinsic strength of the solar activity. Therefore, SRS intensity measurements are useful for
   comparison between sweeps only at a single observatory, and even then not over more than a
   period of a few hours. Sweep intensity comparisons between observatories have many
   complications currently rendering them unreliable. It is common for reports from different
   observatories on the same sweep to indicate different intensities, and possibly different start
   and end times, since these times (especially for continuums) depend on the measured
   intensity.
AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  63


  7.2.2. The intensity recorded by the SRS antennas are subject to many factors of non-solar
  origin. Some of these factors are: atmospheric weather conditions, solar elevation angle,
  ionospheric attenuation, antenna polar response, local interference, and equipment
  calibrations.
  7.2.3. The intensity for continuum sweeps should be reported as an updated preliminary
  whenever intensity or frequency range increases. A continuum sweep will always remain
  encoded at the highest intensity reached at any time of the continuum. Type 3 or 5 sweeps
  embedded in a continuum only need be reported separately if they have a higher intensity
  than the continuum itself or are reported in conjunction with associated discrete burst
  activity.
     7.2.3.1. Ionospheric Attenuation.
         7.2.3.1.1. At sunrise and sunset, solar radio signals strike the earth’s ionosphere at a
         grazing angle. Much of the signal strength in the SRS frequency range can be
         reflected off the ionosphere back into space. As a result, the received signal intensity
         (which equates to sweep importance) is lower than if it were observed near local
         noon. For example, when the Kaena Point Solar Observatory reports an importance 3
         sweep near local noon, the Learmonth Solar Observatory (at local sunrise) might
         report the same sweep as importance 1 (or even no sweep at all). The magnitude of
         this affect is greatest when the degree of ionization in the ionosphere is high, as
         occurs near solar cycle maximum.
         7.2.3.1.2. Ionospheric irregularities can also produce radio wave focusing or
         defocusing. Solar radio signals may then undergo severe ionospheric refraction,
         possibly even reflection off the earth’s surface, before they are received by the SRS
         antennas. The observed sweep intensity would be drastically different (usually
         smaller, but occasionally larger) than if the signal were received directly.
     7.2.3.2. Antenna Polar Response. The SRS low band antenna is designed to have an
     omni directional sensitivity with a broad bandwidth. However, the antenna response
     pattern may contain nulls at various positions. Observed sweep intensities will then
     depend on the sun’s position in the sky. This effect is independent of any positional
     effects due to ionospheric attenuation.
     7.2.3.3. Local Interference. Each observatory is subject to widely different RFI
     environments, which can vary over time, due to terrestrial broadcasters like television
     stations. This RFI can also make equipment calibration efforts difficult. The result can
     be variations in sweep intensities reported by different observatories.
     7.2.3.4. Equipment Calibration. No attempt has ever been made to perform intersite
     calibrations of SRS equipment. Such a task is not practical due to the nature of the
     equipment (omni directional, wideband), differences in monitored frequency range, and
     the varying RFI environments at and between the observatories.
         7.2.3.4.1. Self Test. The SRS initiates an automatic self-test request one-minute after
         sunrise start-up. The self-test sequence consists of five successive levels where the
         tracking generator is set to four output levels. The Minimum Discernible Signal
         (MDS) is site specific and determined at installation and should be validated yearly
         by maintenance.
 64                                                   AFWAMAN15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


          7.2.3.4.2. The self test can also be performed manually at the analyst’s discretion by
          clicking on the SELF TEST button on the SRS Display window or the SOLACON
          Display window.
          7.2.3.4.3. If either the low band or high band, or both, fails the self test will provide
          the operator with a notification. The data should be qualified until maintenance
          personnel have resolved the problem.
7.3. Type IV and Type 8 Continuums.
   7.3.1. Both a Type IV and Type 8 continuum has virtually the same appearance on a SRS
   plot.
      7.3.1.1. The only reliable way to distinguish between a Type IV and Type 8 is by
      knowledge of what is happening on the sun. Radio analysts should keep abreast on all
      recent solar activity by reading any available optical plains, summaries, imagery, and
      forecasts.
      7.3.1.2. If a continuum is preceded by a significant (not necessarily event-level) flare,
      solar disk and limb activity summary code (DALAS), discrete frequency radio burst,
      Type II sweep, or intense Type III or Type V sweep(s), it is reasonable to assume the
      continuum is a Type IV. If not preceded by such activity, assume it is a Type 8
      continuum.
      7.3.1.3. If a continuum is found to be in progress at sunrise, a decision on the
      identification (Type IV or Type 8) will be necessary. Consult teletype bulletins,
      SPACEWOC, or another observatory to learn if the current continuum is being carried as
      a Type IV or Type 8. NOTE: If it is decided to be a Type IV, Event message (SXXX_
      _) reporting is not appropriate as the onset of the event would have occurred more than
      15 minutes earlier.
   7.3.2. Not all Type IV continuums are preceded by a Type II, however, there is a close
   correlation between the two types of sweeps. On the other hand, Type 8 continuums and
   Type IIs are unrelated, and will occur together only by coincidence.
   7.3.3. A Type IV continuum will typically last from several hours to several days, and will
   normally decline in intensity as time passes. The absolute minimum duration for a Type IV
   (for coding purposes) is ten minutes. Long duration Type IV continuums will eventually
   degenerate into Type 8 continuums, but there is no way for an analyst to easily detect when
   that change occurs. As a rule of thumb, an analyst may choose to change a Type IV to a
   Type 8 continuum after roughly 36 to 48 hours.
7.4. Radio Frequency Interference and SRS Data.
   7.4.1. On the SRS, solar bursts are relatively easy to distinguish from RFI. The
   unambiguous nature of SRS data (i.e., whether solar or RFI) can indicate the origin of data
   on other instruments. For example, solar noise storms are common on the 245 and 410 MHz
   RIMS radiometers. Anytime a strong continuum sweep is in progress, the 245 MHz
   radiometer will be active. It may not reach noise storm criteria, but it will not be flatline.
   Unfortunately, noise storms observed on single frequency radiometers are often
   indistinguishable from long duration RFI. A strong noise storm on 245 or 410 MHz is often
   accompanied by series of Type III and/or Type V sweeps, or a Type 8 (decameter)

   Continuum. Thus, the presence of the sweep activity supports the solar nature of the activity
   observed on the RIMS radiometer(s). Continuums are evidence of interference on VHF
   systems.
   7.4.2. Solar radio interference on ionospheric monitoring equipment or systems.
      7.4.2.1. Type 8 or Type IV decameter continuums, as well as strong Type II and/or Type
      III/V sweeps, can sometimes be detected as spikes on HF frequency monitoring
      equipment.
   7.4.3. RFI on the SRS.
      7.4.3.1. A major geomagnetic storm can drastically alter the degree of ionization in
      portions of the earth’s ionosphere (referred to as an “ionospheric storm”), and change the
      transmission characteristics of the ionosphere. The base of the ionosphere becomes more
      reflective, and ground transmissions in the SRS frequency range can be reflected into the
      SRS antenna system.
