SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Adds new paragraph 6.2.1, providing for delegation of AF/A3/5 waiver authority to
MAJCOM/A3s for a limited period to cover specified categories of waiver actions. A margin
bar (|) indicates newly revised material.
1. General. This Instruction prescribes basic guidance for aircrew training,
standardization/evaluations and general operations procedures publications IAW AFPD 11-2,
Aircrew Publications.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, Plans and Requirements (AF/A3/5) interprets
     policy and provides oversight for aircrew operations guidance and procedures. This
     responsibility is executed by the Director of Operations (AF/A3O), and the Director of
     Operations Force Management (AF/A3O-A). AF/A3/5 is the approval authority for lead,
     MDS-, and aircrew-specific AFIs.
     2.2. AF/A3O or AF/A3O-A, as directed by AF/A3/5, is the certifying authority for lead,
     MDS-, and aircrew-specific AFIs. AF/A3O establishes and manages guidance for training,
     standardization/evaluation, and general operations procedures, through lead AFIs. Lead
     AFIs are AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training; AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew
     Standardization/Evaluation Program; and AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules.
        2.2.1. AF/A3O-AI is the OPR AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
        2.2.2. AFFSA/A3OF is the OPR for AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
     2.3. MAJCOMs, DRUs and FOAs establish implementing guidance and procedures.
        2.3.1. The lead MAJCOM/DRU will establish and coordinate guidance with all user
        commands for aircraft of the same design series or aircrew specialty. AFPD 10-9, Lead
        Command Designation and Responsibilities for Weapon Systems, designates lead
        commands.
        2.3.2. All MAJCOMs, DRUs and FOAs will comply with guidance published in lead
        AFIs and in applicable MDS- and aircrew-specific AFIs.
3. Publications Structure.
     3.1. The standard AFI set incorporates three lead AFIs and a three-volume set of MDS- or
     aircrew-specific AFIs. The lead AFIs are of higher precedence than the MDS- or aircrew-
     specific AFIs.
     3.2. The three lead AFIs provide basic guidance applicable to MDS- and aircrew-specific
     AFIs.
        3.2.1. AFI 11-202, Vol 1. This AFI provides basic training guidance.
        3.2.2. AFI 11-202, Vol 2. This AFI establishes the Air Force aircrew standardization
        and evaluation program and provides basic standardization and evaluation guidance.
        3.2.3. AFI 11-202, Vol 3. This AFI prescribes general flight rules that govern the
        operation of Air Force aircraft and provides basic operational guidance for the operation
        of Air Force aircraft.
AFI11-200 19 JANUARY 2012                                                                      3


   3.3. Each MDS or aircrew specialty will have an MDS- or aircrew-specific AFI set,
   structured as follows:
      3.3.1. AFI 11-2 MDS- or aircrew-specific, Volume 1, Training. This AFI will
      implement basic guidance provided in AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and will establish specific
      training programs, to include qualification, continuation, upgrade, and ancillary training.
          3.3.1.1. Lead and user commands may utilize aircrew-specific tasking messages (or
          other procedures) to establish and implement specific training programs and
          requirements. Tasking messages (or other procedures) will be detailed in MDS- or
          aircrew-specific Volumes 1 AFIs.
      3.3.2. AFI 11-2 MDS- or aircrew-specific, Volume 2, Aircrew/Crew Evaluation Criteria.
      This AFI will implement basic guidance provided in AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and will
      establish mission/airframe/aircrew specific qualification criteria.

      will implement basic guidance provided in AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and will provide
      MDS- or aircrew-specific operational guidance.
      3.3.4. AFMC may establish a Flight Test (FT) publications set to govern AFMC flight
      operations. When AFMC is the lead command, aircraft operations procedures will be
      published in the Volume 3 AFI.
      3.3.5. AFIs that consolidate multiple MDS-specific publications into a single publication
      are authorized with the following provisions:
          3.3.5.1. The designated lead MAJCOM authorizes consolidation into a single
          publication.
          3.3.5.2. Training, standardization/evaluation, and operational procedures are similar
          among the separate MDS, with few exceptions.
      3.3.6. In addition to the standard three-volume AFI set, lead commands will establish
      other publications as required to provide specific guidance and instructions governing
      flying operations. Such publications may include, but are not limited to, flying
      fundamentals and aircraft demonstrations.
      3.3.7. MDS-specific tactics and fundamental procedures will be published as non-
      directive tactical level doctrine, IAW AFI 33-360 and AFI 10-1301, Air Force Doctrine.
4. Publications Supplements.

     5.1. Volumes 1 and 2 of MDS- or aircrew-specific 11-2 series publications. After lead and
     user MAJCOM/DRU/FOA coordination, send new or revised publications to AF/A3O-AI.
     AF/A3O-AI will staff publications for HAF coordination, certification and approval.
     5.2. Volume 3 of MDS- or aircrew-specific 11-2 series publications. After lead and user
     MAJCOM/DRU/FOA coordination, send new or revised publications to AFFSA/A3OF.
     AFFSA/A3OF will staff publications for HAF coordination, certification and approval.
     (AFFSA may coordinate with AF/A3O-AI to accomplish HAF actions.)
6. Waiver Authority.
     6.1. AF/A3O may authorize waivers to this AFI for essential MAJCOM requirements.
     6.2. Waiver authority for publications approved by AF/A3/5 is the publication certifying
     authority, unless otherwise specified in the individual publication.

NOTES:
1. Author and Internal Coordination. OPR determines need for publication and develops draft.
Draft formatted IAW AFI 33-360.
2. Field Coordination. OPR coordinates draft with user commands and obtains MAJCOM/A3
(or equivalent) coordination.
3. Resolution. As necessary, OPR reviews comments and resolves issues.
4. Edit. Final draft is produced and sent to lead AFI OPR.
5. HAF Coordination. OPR provides formatted final draft and AF Form 673 (showing user
MAJCOM/A3 coordination) to AF/A3O-AT or AFFSA/A3OF (IAW paragraph 5). Lead AFI
OPR POC will review draft for content and format and send draft out for mandatory coordination
 8                                                             AFI11-200 19 JANUARY 2012


as specified in AFI 33-360 (or return draft to OPR if changes are required). HAF coord time
includes mandatory coordination and comment resolution actions, but does not include time to
resolve initial content and format issues. Interim Changes and Guidance Memorandums require
lead AFI OPR POC review, but do not require mandatory coordination
6. Certification and Approval. Lead AFI OPR POC provides final draft and signed AF Form
673 to designated HAF certifying and approving authorities.
7. Publishing. Lead AFI OPRs sends the completed AF Form 673 and final draft Word version
of the publication to the Air Force Departmental Publishing Office (AFDPO) for publishing
IAW AFI 33-360. Publishing times are approximate and may vary based on AFDPO workload.
8. Guidance Memorandum. IAW AFI 33-360, Guidance Memorandums expire after 180 days
and must be superseded by a publications revision or an Interim Change.
9. Guidance Memorandum – Immediate Release. GMs that require immediate release only
require HAF legal review and the approval authority’s signature prior to publication.
10. Administrative Changes are non-substantive and do not require coordination.
11. All times are approximate and are for planning purposes only and are based on historical
data. When/if future publishing processes change and conflicts exist, the guidance in AFI 33-
360 takes precedence.
