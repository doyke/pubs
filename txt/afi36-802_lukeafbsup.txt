3.1.1.3. (Added) Approval of AF Form 428 Request: Group commanders are authorized to
approve requests for overtime or compensatory time. This authority may be delegated, in writing,
to squadron commanders. 56 FW/DS will be the approving official for Wing Staff Agencies.
3.1.1.4. (Added) Justification Requirements on AF Form 428 Request: Approving officials
and supervisors will ensure justifications on AF Form 428, Request for Overtime, Holiday
Premium Pay, and Compensatory Time, are sufficient in detail to allow an approving official to
evaluate and determine the necessity of the overtime work to be performed. Justifications must
include work to be performed, why overtime work is required, and/or what caused the temporary
surge in work performed.
3.1.1.5. (Added) Certification of Funds: The 56 FW Civilian Corporate Board (CCB) will
establish the annual wing overtime budget, excluding 56 MDG, normally not to exceed .5%
(one-half percent) of the total non-Foreign Military Sales pay budget. 56 CPTS/FMA will assign
overtime ceilings to each group based on past overtime requirements and related justifications.
These ceilings will be reexamined and adjusted at the periodic CCB meetings, or as needed.
3.1.1.5.1. (Added) Between October and July of each fiscal year, the group commander, or
their designee, may certify funds available for overtime work performed within their group – not
to exceed the overtime funding allocated to their unit. Delegation of this authority must be in
writing and a copy of the delegation should be provided to 56 CPTS/FMA.
3.1.1.5.2. (Added) During August and September (end of fiscal year), overtime fund
certification will be accomplished by 56 CPTS/FMA during the end of year process. Except for
56 MDG, group Resource Advisors (RAs) will submit estimates for August and September to 56
CPTS/FMA as of 1 Aug to ensure sufficient funding is set aside to meet group demands. Bi-
weekly updates to the estimates will be required the last two months of the fiscal year. During
the last month of the fiscal year (September), group RAs should forward copies of the AF Form
428 to 56 CPTS/FMA to support any accounting transaction required to be established for an
outstanding obligation in the wing’s accounting records before 30 Sep.
3.1.2.1. (Added) Supervisors must provide a copy of the approved AF Form 428 to time and
attendance approving officials and timekeepers for audit purposes.
3.1.2.2. (Added) Use of Earned Compensatory Time: Supervisors should ensure employees
use compensatory time within one year to prevent it from converting to overtime pay.
