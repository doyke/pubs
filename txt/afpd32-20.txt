4. Policies.
   4.1. FES common level services are maintained commensurate with local and corporate risk
   factors as prescribed by AFI 32-2001, Fire Emergency Services Program.
   4.2. FES programs are required at each installation, permanent and expeditionary. They
   include a fire prevention program and an emergency response program. Components of the
   fire prevention program include project plans review, inspection, enforcement, and
   education. The emergency response program includes capability to manage all-hazard
   emergency events that include but are not limited to incident command, fire fighting, rescue,
   emergency medical support and mitigation of hazardous materials releases or use of weapons
   of mass destruction (WMD), including chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and

   environment due to their toxic, corrosive, flammable, explosive, or chemically reactive
   nature; or those substances designated as hazardous under the Comprehensive Environmental
   Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 USC, Chapter 103), or as defined by
   AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations.
   For overseas installations, hazardous materials are listed in host nation governing standards
   and environmental guidance documents.
   5.3. WMD is defined by Joint Publication (JP) 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of
   Military and Associated Terms, as chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons
   capable of a high order of destruction or causing mass casualties. WMD excludes the means
   of transporting or propelling the weapon where such means is a separable and divisible part
   from the weapon.
