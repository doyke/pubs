TCMax system. This publication also reflects new publication format changes.
1. Tool Accountability and Control.
2                                                             433AWI21-104 8 AUGUST 2013


    1.1. Work centers will use a “show and know” concept for Composite Tool Kit (CTKs),
    cabinets and shadow boards, employing either cut-outs, labels, shadows, or silhouettes that
    facilitate the immediate identification of missing tools.
    1.2. Issue of Tools and CTKs:
       1.2.1. Work centers will use Tool Accountability System (TCMax) for accountability
       and control of tools and tool kits. NOTE: Aircrew Tools and Aircrew Flight Equipment
       CTKs will be manually tracked in accordance with IAW AFI 21-101 and AFI 11-301 Vl,
       Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program. Additionally, ALS shops will develop local
       tracking procedures to track quantity of serviceable/unserviceable oxygen connectors
       dispatched to and from the flightline.
       1.2.2. The individual checking out the tool or kit bears the responsibility for the control
       and security of the tool or kit until it is returned to the tool center. Dispatched kits and
       equipment must be secured when left unattended. Unattended kits located within a
       controlled area must be locked but need not be secured to another object. Never secure
       kits to the exterior of an aircraft.
       1.2.3. Dispatchable CTKs will contain an Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Form
       177, Consolidated Tool Kit Inventory and Control Log. CTKs transferred from one
       individual to another at the job site will be inventoried by both parties and the transfer
       will be documented on the AFRC Form 177.
       1.2.4. Tools and kits will be turned in at the end of each assigned shift. Tools and kits
       required for longer than the current shift (e.g. Temporary Deployment (TDY),
       deployments, etc.) will be issued “Long Term” in TCMax.
    1.3. Inventory Procedures:
       1.3.1. Maintain a Master Inventory List (MIL) for inventory purposes in every CTK.
       1.3.2. Dispatchable tool kits will be inventoried by the tool center monitor and the
       individual checking out the kit at issue and again at return. Additionally, while in use,
       kits must be inventoried prior to aircraft or equipment operation (engine runs, operational
       checks, etc.) when maintenance has been performed.
       1.3.3. Tool centers must account for all CTKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment at the
       beginning and end of each shift:
           1.3.3.1. The contents of dispatchable CTKs need not be inventoried until signed out.
           Contents of non-dispatchable CTKs that are opened must be inventoried at the
           beginning and end of each shift.
           1.3.3.2. CTKs used in an off-equipment environment (in-shop) that are not
           dispatched may be left open for multiple personnel to use during a shift. In-shop
           CTKs are inventoried each time they are opened and/or closed.
       1.3.4. In work centers where only one employee is present, tool kits will be inventoried
       by the shop supervisor at the next shift change. In the event that there is only one
       individual and one shift in a work center, the flight chief or production supervisor will
       provide oversight for tool checkout.
433AWI21-104 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                        3


     1.3.5. Inventory of replacement/spare tools must be accomplished and documented
     quarterly.
     1.3.6. A work center master tool inventory listing must be established and kept in the
     shop chief’s office or tool center. At least annually and when the CTK custodian changes,
     supervisors will ensure that a comprehensive inventory of all tools is accomplished and
     documented:
         1.3.6.1. Perform an extensive inspection to include condition, Equipment
         Identification Designators (EIDs), and accuracy of the MIL.
         1.3.6.2. Inspect all tools for serviceability (reference Technical Order (TO) 32-1-101,
         Use and Care of Hand Tools and Measuring Tools).
  1.4. Tool center monitors will ensure an adequate supply of AFRC Forms 177 are kept on
  hand. In the event of computer outage, tool check out/in will be documented on the AFRC
  Form 177 until connectivity is restored and TCMax can be updated. Tool room monitors will
  update TCMax as soon as it is available.
  1.5. Control of Consumable and Expendable Items:
     1.5.1. Consumables and expendables such as safety wire and apexes, may be maintained
     in CTKs provided that:
         1.5.1.1. They are marked with a proper EID.
         1.5.1.2. They are tracked in TCMax and identified as consumables on the MIL.
         1.5.1.3. When broken or consumed, the tool monitor will exchange them on a one-
         for-one basis. Lost consumables/expendables will be treated as lost tools (see
         paragraph 6). Monitors will not issue replacement consumables without a lost tool
         report or the broken/consumed item (e.g. broken apex or empty container).
     1.5.2. Rag Control:
         1.5.2.1. Rags may be of different types (e.g. lint free white, red shop rags, grey
         absorbent pads). However, each type will be uniform in size, shape and color and
         issued separately from other types of rags.
         1.5.2.2. Work centers may pre-package rags to add to CTKs. Packages will be added
         to the MIL and marked with the CTK number, type and number of rags. Packages
         will be replenished at inventory upon return to the tool center.
         1.5.2.3. Soiled rags will be retained in plastic bags until turned in to the tool center at
         the end of the shift. When necessary, tool center monitors may exchange soiled rags
         for clean rags on a one for one basis. Tool center monitors will dispose of rags in
         their proper containers.
  1.6. Individual Issue Equipment:
     1.6.1. For equipment that will be issued to and maintained by individuals, designated
     monitors will create a ‘CTK’ in TCMax for each individual receiving equipment.
 4                                                               433AWI21-104 8 AUGUST 2013


This CTK number will contain the first four digits of the shop World Wide Identifier (WWID)
(See paragraph 3.1.7.) and the employee number of the individual receiving the equipment (e.g.
R5FM00285). Supervisors need not show the CTK as ‘issued’ in TCMax.
            1.6.1.1. Each item of individual issued equipment will be marked with the WWID as
            described above.
            1.6.1.2. Supervisors may elect to create individual equipment kits that will be
            maintained in the tool room and issued out in TCMax on an as needed basis (use
            standard identification conventions as described in paragraphs 3.1.7. through 3.2. to
            mark these kits).
            1.6.1.3. Use of personal tools (other than as specified above) is strictly prohibited.
            1.6.1.4. Lost/missing individual equipment will be treated as lost tools. Comply with
            the procedures outlined in paragraph 6 of this instruction.
     1.7. Tool Procurement Monitors:
        1.7.1. Personnel authorized to procure unit tools will be limited to individuals designated
        by squadron commanders, maintenance operations officers or superintendents.
        1.7.2. Replacement/spare tools will be strictly controlled by flight chiefs and/or
        designated tool procurement monitors. Replacement tools will not be issued to replenish
        a CTK without the broken tool or a completed lost tool report. Warranty tools requiring
        replacement will be returned to the manufacture for replacement.
        1.7.3. Procurement monitors/flight chiefs will ensure that the local manufacture of tools
        is either Technical Order (TO) directed or approved by Quality Assurance (QA) and
        processed in accordance with MXG Operating Instruction (OI) 21-115, Local
        Manufacture Policy.
        1.7.4. Procurement monitors will manage the turn-in and control of warranted tools.
     1.8. Squadrons will appoint the following individuals:
        1.8.1. Limit authorization to clear Red X’s when a tool/item cannot be located to no
        lower than Maintenance Operations Officer/Superintendent (MXOO SUPT).
        1.8.2. Tool Center TCMax Administrators (primary and alternate) are to administer the
        tool center’s TCMax Program and serve as liaison to the group TCMax Administrator.
        1.8.3. CTK Monitors (as many as necessary to ensure adequate tool center coverage). In
        smaller shops Tool Center Administrators and CTK Monitors may be the same
        individuals.
     1.9. Emergency Response Equipment (e.g. crash recovery, Hazardous Material (HAZMAT),
     etc.):
        1.9.1. All equipment must be inspected for serviceability before and after each use
        (including exercises).
        1.9.2. Portable kits, trailers, etc. must have a Master Inventory List (MIL) for inventory
        purposes. Conduct a complete inventory using the MIL prior to and after each use.
433AWI21-104 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      5


       1.9.3. At least annually (or as directed in TOs, manufacturer’s manuals or other
       directives) conduct a thorough inspection and inventory. Include operational checks
       when directed by applicable technical data.
       1.9.4. Supervisors must load dispatchable emergency response equipment into TCMax
       for issue and to track and document inventories/inspections. In shop equipment (e.g. spill
       kits) inspections and inventories may be tracked in the Maintenance Information System
       (MIS).
2. Tool Identification.
   2.1. All tools will be etched to identify them to a CTK. Tools which cannot be etched
   because of size will be placed in a container. The container will be marked with the CTK
   number and the number and size(s) of tools it contains.
   2.2. Tools owned by Contract Field Teams (CFTs), Depot Teams and Factory
   Representatives will be marked with a unique designator that identifies the team. The
   contract Quality Assurance Representative (QAR) will monitor CFTs for compliance.
   2.3. Tools/expendable items used for titanium engine blade blending or oxygen system
   maintenance will be kept in a special purpose kits separated from other tools. These kits will
   be marked “Controlled Items” “For Titanium Engine Blade Blending Only” For tools utilized
   in oxygen system maintenance, mark them with the following statement: “For Oxygen
   System Use Only”
3. Tool Accountability System (TCMax).
   3.1. While TCMax is used to document inventories, it does not relieve the issuer and issuee
   of physical inventory responsibilities at issue and turn in.
       3.1.1. The AFRC Form, 177 Consolidated Tool Kit Inventory and Control Log will be
       maintained in dispatchable CTKs to document on the job site transfer of CTKs
       (paragraph 1.2.3.). The AFRC Form 175, Missing/Removed Tools, will also be
       maintained in CTKs to document broken and missing tools until the tool center TCMax
       administrator transfers the data into TCMax. At the time of TCMax update, the tool
       center TCMax administrator will line through the item and initial the “Verified By” block
       of the AFRC Form175.
       3.1.2. The TCMax database will be backed up at least once every 30 days. TCMax
       transaction and inspection history will be maintained for 2 years. Manual documentation
       will be maintained for 30 days unless otherwise specified.
   3.2. Tool Center EIDs. The following identifiers are assigned as the first four digits of every
   TCMax EID in the Maintenance Group (MXG):

        must also be marked with a WWID EID.
4. Tools Damaged or Removed from CTKs.
     4.1. All damaged tools will be turned in to the tool procurement monitor for replacement.
     4.2. Shop chiefs and tool center monitors will ensure prompt replacement of damaged tools.
     4.3. While awaiting replacement, the tool center monitor will cover the cut-out/shadow until
     a replacement tool is issued. Develop a system for immediate identification of missing tools.
     For example, use a red tag or tags for broken/missing tools, blue for long term issue and
     green for TMDE awaiting calibration. All removed tools will be documented on the AFRC
433AWI21-104 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       7


   Form 175 until TCMax is updated. The AFRC Form 175 will be maintained in the tool kit
   with the tool inventory listing.
5. Lost Tool Procedures.
   5.1. Flightline and Aircraft.
      5.1.1. An individual losing a tool on or around an aircraft will report immediately to the
      expediter and/or shop supervisor. If not found after an initial search, the expediter or
      supervisor will notify the flight line production supervisor and Maintenance Operations
      Center (MOC) who, in turn, will notify the MXG/CC and QA. The aircraft will be
      immediately grounded and lost tool procedures initiated. The individual losing the tool is
      responsible for initiation of lost tool procedures. The expediter or shop chief will ensure
      initiation of AFRC Form 174, Lost Tool/Object Report, before the next shift change.
      5.1.2. Enter a Red X discrepancy in the aircraft forms stating the type of tool and the last
      known area the tool was used.
      5.1.3. Conduct a thorough search. If the tool is found, the investigation is complete. If
      the tool is not found, the Maintenance Operations Officer/Superintendent (MXOO/SUPT)
      will sign block 8 of the AFRC Form 174, authorizing termination of the search and
      clearance of the Red X (see paragraph 1.8.1.). If at any time during or following the
      investigation, the tool is found and retrieved, notify the expediter, production super (or
      flight chief) and MOC, who in turn, will notify the MXG/CC and QA.
          5.1.3.1. After normal duty hours, authorization to terminate the search may be
          obtained from the MXOO/SUPT by telephone. In this event, write “telecom” in the
          INDIVIDUAL INITIALS column of block 8 and enter the time and date of
          authorization in the TIME/DATE INITIALED column. Obtain signature for the
          block 8 of the AFRC Form 174 the following duty day.
      5.1.4. Expediters or shop chiefs will ensure complete documentation (all blocks) of the
      AFRC Form 174. Forward one completed copy each to the tool center monitor, squadron
      supervision, and QA within 48 hours of losing the tool. Tool centers will maintain AFRC
      Forms 174 on file until the item is found or 1 year, whichever comes first.
   5.2. Post Taxi/Take-off Procedures.
      5.2.1. MOC will notify the MXG/CC and Command Post immediately upon the post
      take-off discovery of a lost tool.
      5.2.2. Command Post will contact the aircraft and brief the crew on the type of tool and
      last known area the tool was used.
      5.2.3. Away from home station, the aircraft commander (following a thorough search)
      has the authority to clear a Red X when a tool cannot be found.
      5.2.4. The aircraft will immediately be placed on a Red X upon return to home station
      and the expediter or production supervisor will ensure compliance with the procedures
      outlined in paragraph 5.
   5.3. In Shop/Off Equipment.
      5.3.1. Individuals losing a tool in the shop area will report to the supervisor immediately.
8                                                          433AWI21-104 8 AUGUST 2013


    5.3.2. If not found after an initial search, immediately place a Red X in any affected
    equipment forms, Air Force Technical Order(AFTO) Form 244, Industrial / Support
    Equipment Record, or equivalent. Use Lockout/Tagout procedures outlined in 433D
    MXG OI 21-119, Lockout/Tagout Program, when applicable.
    5.3.3. Conduct a thorough search including dismantlement if necessary and practical.
    5.3.4. If after a thorough search, the tool is not found, the individual losing the tool is
    responsible for initiation of lost tool procedures. Shop chiefs are responsible for ensuring
    initiation of the AFRC Form 174 prior to the next shift change. Notify MOC of the lost
