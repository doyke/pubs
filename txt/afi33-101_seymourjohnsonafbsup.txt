     1.12.23. Assign an individual as the functional manager with collateral responsibility to the per-
     sonnel community for accession, training, classification, utilization, and career development of
     enlisted information management (AFSC 3A0X1) personnel. These personnel operate in every
     functional area and, although most are not assigned to the communications unit, they are special-
     ized extensions of the total capability for SC to support the Air Force mission. A network of open
     communications is critical among these personnel at all levels.
     1.12.23. (SEYMOUR JOHNSON) The Wing 3A0X1 Functional Manager (3AFM) will be des-
     ignated by the 4th Communications Squadron Commander (4 CS/CC). Normally, the senior
     enlisted Information Manager assigned to the Communications Squadron will be the Wing 3AFM.
     The Wing 3AFM’s responsibilities extend to every unit in the 4th Fighter Wing with a 3A0X1
     authorization or where one is assigned (including the 23 FG, Pope AFB, NC). The Wing 3AFM is
     the focal point for all Information Management related issues.
        1.12.23.1. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Group 3A0X1 Functional Managers will be
        designated by their respective Group Commander. The Group 3AFM’s responsibilities extend
        to every unit in the Group with a 3A0X1 authorization, or where one is assigned, and is the
        Group’s focal point on all matters concerning 3A0X1s. The Group 3AFM should report
        directly to the Group Commanders concerning Information Management issues, however
        Group Commander’s may delegate this responsibility appropriately. Wing Staff Agencies will
        be considered equal to a “Group.” The Director of Staff will act in the same capacity as a
        Group Commander involving Information Management issues for personnel assigned to 4th
        Fighter Wing Staff Agencies. Therefore, any use of the term “Group” will also apply to Wing
        Staff Agencies.
        1.12.23.2. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Group Commanders. Group Commanders will:
            1.12.23.2.1. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Designate, via an appointment letter to
            the 4th Communications Squadron Commander, a primary and alternate Group 3AFM.
            The Group 3AFM is the Group point of contact for all Information Management related
            issues within their respective Group. These individuals should be the senior enlisted Infor-
            mation Managers within the Group. If possible, at least one of these individuals should be
            assigned to the Group Commander’s Support Staff. Groups assigned to the 4th Fighter
            Wing that do not have military Information Management personnel (3A0X1) have the
            option to appoint a Group 3AFM.
        1.12.23.3. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Unit Commanders and Wing Staff Agencies
        Chiefs. Unit Commanders and Wing Staff Agencies Chiefs with Information Management
        personnel assigned will:
            1.12.23.3.1. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Ensure Information Management person-
            nel are placed in positions as authorized by the Unit Manpower Document. If additional
            Information Management manpower is required, contact the base Manpower Office to

     Pope AFB, North Carolina.
     1.12.23.3.4. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Ensure all assigned Information Manag-
     ers are correctly postured and reported correctly in the Aerospace Expeditionary Force
     (AEF) Unit Type Code (UTC) Status Reporting Tool (ART). The unit of assignment is
     responsible for all ART reporting.
     1.12.23.3.5. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Report all information management
     related problems, challenges, or issues to their respective Group 3AFM. If the issue cannot
     be resolved within the Group, the Group 3AFM will raise the issue with the Wing 3AFM.
     If the situation still cannot be resolved, the Wing 3AFM will arrange a meeting between
     the Unit Commander/Wing Staff Agency Chief and the 4 CS/CC.
     1.12.23.3.6. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Assign Information Managers as the
     Work Group Managers (WM) ahead of other AFSCs in accordance with AFI 33-115, Vol-
     ume 1, Networks Operations, paragraphs 3.10.7 and 4.8. In addition, supervisors at all lev-
     els will allow assigned Information Managers to attend established Wing-wide WM
     training programs. Programs will be established by the 4th Communications Squadron.
     The 23d Fighter Group will use existing support agreements to obtain WM training at
     Pope AFB, NC.
     1.12.23.3.7. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Assign Information Managers as Unit
     Web Masters ahead of other AFSCs to support CFETP requirements and UTC Mission
     Capabilities Statements (MISCAPS). In addition, supervisors at all levels will allow
     assigned Information Managers to attend established Wing-wide web page training pro-
     grams. Programs will be established by the 4th Communications Squadron. The 23d
     Fighter Group will use existing support agreements to obtain web-page training at Pope
     AFB, NC.
     1.12.23.3.8. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Ensure all assigned Information Manage-
     ment personnel are fully trained to perform their assigned duties outlined in the UTC MIS-
     CAPS. Training is obtained through established programs by the Wing 3AFM. This
     training is defined as technical training to allow the Information Manager to perform
     3A0X1 tasks. The unit of assignment is responsible for conducting/scheduling war skills
     type training (M16, Chemical Warfare, Self-Aid Buddy Care, etc.). Supervisors at all lev-
     els will allow assigned Information Managers to attend established Information Manage-
     ment training programs.

        tive) will establish and maintain a 3AFM web page to post information related to the career
        field.
        1.12.23.5.8. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Wing 3AFM will provide input and feed-
        back to next level Information Management functional manager (ACC) on any issue
        involving an Information Manager for training, meetings, conferences, and Utilization and
        Training Workshops.
        1.12.23.5.9. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Wing 3AFM will establish and imple-
        ment an Information Manager Training and Orientation Program for newly assigned Infor-
        mation Management personnel. In addition, the Wing 3AFM will establish and implement,
        as needed, technical training programs (Workgroup Management, Content Management,
        Records Management, etc.) through appropriate base agencies.
        1.12.23.5.10. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Group 3AFM’s will coordinate on tech-
        nical training attendance (Workgroup Management, Content Management, Records Man-

        permanent change of station (PCS) personnel to the Groups taking into account compara-
        tive manning among the Group’s skill levels, grade authorizations, and experience levels.
        Direct duty retrainee personnel and technical school graduates will be allocated to 4th
        Fighter Wing units as outlined in the Information Management Training and Orientation
        Guide.
AFI33-101_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 5 APRIL 2005                                                      13


          1.12.23.6.2. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Group 3AFM will allocate all inbound
          PCS personnel to the units within their Group taking into account comparative manning
          among the unit’s skill levels, grade authorizations, and experience levels. They will also
          ensure personnel are assigned to positions commensurate with their grade and skill level,
          when feasible.
          1.12.23.6.3. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) The Wing 3AFM will monitor and facili-
          tate rotation of Information Management personnel among the Groups to enhance training
          and provide opportunities for career broadening, as well as Wing leveling actions. Level-
          ing actions are executed when the manning of one Group substantially exceeds that of
          another or one Group has a significant surplus of a particular grade or skill level as deter-
          mined by funded authorizations, as indicated on the Unit Manning Document. The Group
          3AFM will do the same at the unit level, however if needs are beyond the Group’s capabil-
          ities, the Group 3AFM will contact the Wing 3AFM to workout a possible solution. The
          Wing 3AFM will make recommendations on manning levels to the 4 CS/CC in both over-
          ages and shortages of personnel. The 4 CS/CC will coordinate manning levels appropri-
          ately with Group Commanders.
          1.12.23.6.4. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Due to the wide spectrum of the 3A0
          career field, Information Management personnel should be rotated every 18-24 months, if
          possible, to facilitate professional development. The Wing 3AFM will schedule meetings,
          as needed, with Group 3AFMs to identify and consider Information Management person-
          nel for rotation. Once an Information Manager is identified as a candidate for rotation, the
          Group 3AFM will then coordinate the proposal using internal guidelines established by
          each Group. The 3AFMs will recommend moving Information Managers that are the best
          fit at the time--this does not mean that units will get the best Information Manager in the
          Wing. The Group’s 3AFM represents his/her Group’s interests, but all need to support
          what is best for the Wing. No announcement of any kind or discussion of proposed moves
          will be made outside of the 3AFM’s, 4 CS/CC and involved commanders (or designated
          representatives) until all moves have been properly approved/coordinated by the 4 CS/CC.
          Information Management personnel assigned to the 23 FG can only rotate between squad-
          ron’s in the 23 FG. Any move outside of the 23 FG would be considered a Permanent
          Change of Station (PCS) where all PCS requirements would need to be fulfilled. The 23
          FG will create internal procedures for the rotation of 23 FG Information Management per-
          sonnel.
             1.12.23.6.4.1. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Wing 3AFM recommendations will
             be submitted to 4 CS/CC with justification for moves. When the 4 CS/CC approves the
             recommendations, they will officially announce the moves to affected Group/Squadron
             commanders. If any further concerns involving 3A0 moves cannot be resolved by the
             squadrons involved and the 4 CS/CC, the issue will be elevated to the Group Com-
             mander level via the Mission Support Group Commander.
       1.12.23.7. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Mobility/Deployments. All responsibilities
       apply to both the Wing 3AFM and Group 3AFM unless otherwise specified.
          1.12.23.7.1. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Wing 3AFM will receive, review, and
          forward to the ACC Information Management Functional Manager completed AF Forms
          209 (Communications and Information Management After-Action Report) and other after
14                                   AFI33-101_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 5 APRIL 2005


               action reports involving Information Management personnel. Group 3AFM will obtain
               feedback from deployed personnel and provide it to the Wing 3AFM within five (5) duty
               days of return to duty.
               1.12.23.7.2. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Unit’s with only one 3A0X1 authoriza-
               tion are not exempt from selection for contingency and/or exercise deployments. If
               assigned Information Management personnel meet the requirements, they are considered
               deployable and no replacement will be provided. The Group 3AFM and affected squadron
               commanders may coordinate with other units within their Group to assist in providing sup-
               port to the affected unit.
               1.12.23.7.3. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Wing 3AFM will establish Information
               Management reclama guidance (excluding the 23 FG). This guidance will provide steps on
               tasking procedures and methods of completing a Group and Wing level reclama. This
               guidance will be coordinated by Group Commanders, approved by the Wing Commander
               and distributed by the Wing/Group 3AFMs. Unit commanders will ensure Unit Deploy-
               ment Managers are aware of this guidance. The 23 FG 3AFM will establish internal guid-
               ance to manage Information Management reclama procedures and coordinate this
               guidance as appropriate.
            1.12.23.8. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Information Management Awards Program.
            The Wing 3AFM will manage the 4th Fighter Wing’s quarterly and annual Information Man-
            agement awards program as outlined in AFI 36-2845 and applicable supplements.

2. General Guidance.
   2.1. Commanders plan, acquire, operate, and maintain systems consistent with the Technical Archi-
   tecture Framework for Information Management (TAFIM), Joint Technical Architecture (JTA), Air
   Force and MAJCOM plans, architectures, and communications and information systems blueprints.
   They develop and maintain their communications and information plans and architectures according
   to AFI 33-102 and AFI 33-2XX-series publications. Commanders manage information and data
   according to appropriate information management policies in Air Force 37-series publications and
   AFI 33-110.
   2.2. All levels of command ensure compatibility and interoperability with those of other functional
   communities where operational requirements dictate. Satisfy compatibility, interoperability, and
   security requirements before fielding a system, and maintain them throughout the life of each system
   (see DoDD 4630.5, Compatibility, Interoperability, and Integration of Command, Control, Communi-
   cations, and Intelligence (C3I) Systems, November 12, 1992).
   2.3. Provide specific performance-based requirements and associated language in Air Force acquisi-
   tion documents to ensure compliance with mandatory systems standards. Find additional information

     in DISA Technical Reference Model. Find additional information concerning acquisition of commu-
     nications and information equipment requiring research and development in Military Standard
     (MIL-STD)-188-100 series.
     2.4. Include information management public law issues in all planning. This includes records man-
     agement, reports control, information collection control, The Privacy Act, The Freedom of Informa-
     tion Act, The Paperwork Reduction Act, Information Technology Management Reform Act, and The
     Government Performance Results Act.
     2.5. Air Force engineering and installation (EI) standards establish guidelines for uniformity of
     project EI practices. All personnel must ensure their facilities are standardized, where possible, using
     preferred items of equipment.
     2.6. Document Air Force automated information systems according to MIL-STD-498, Defense Sys-
     tem Software Development. NOTE: MIL-STD-498 will be replaced by International Standards
     Organization (ISO)/IEC 12207, J-STD-0162.2/Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers P1448/
     EIA PN3764 (U.S. implementation of ISO/IEC 12207). Use these standards, and best commercial
     practices, when available.
     2.7. Provide adequate security for all systems, to protect the information they process and the avail-
     ability of the system.
     2.8. Embedded computers are normally not communications and information assets. They are part of
     a weapon system and managed according to procedures prescribed by AFI 10-601.
     2.9. To provide for life-cycle management of communications and information assets, base-level
     CSOs and AFMC develop and maintain CSIRs for all Air Force-owned, organic- or contractor-main-
     tained, fixed-plant systems (see AFI 21-404). The supporting CSO provides the single point of con-
     tact for maintenance whether performed by contract, DoD civilian, or active duty military resources.
     2.10. Consolidate VI activities at headquarters and base level. Control and authorize Air Force VI
     activities through issuance of a Defense VI activity number (DVIAN)(see AFI 33-117). MAJCOMs
     inform HQ AFCIC/SYSM of additions, changes, or deletions to the DVIAN database.
     2.11. The base communications and information systems blueprint, developed and maintained by the
     STEM-B in coordination with the base CSO, serves as part of the base's planning, and may be used as
     a basis for requirements development and implementation. Coordinate all requirements that impact
     the infrastructure with the STEM-B to maintain the integrity of the communications and information
     systems blueprint. BPIDs may direct implementation of a portion of the communications and infor-
     mation systems blueprint and authorize expenditure of resources.
     2.12. Communications and information personnel participating in deployments or exercises will use
     AF Form 209 to report their pre-deployment preparation status and deployment duties. See Air Force
     Manual 10-401V1, Chapter 23, for more information.

        2.12.2. DELETED.

3. Planning.
     3.1. AFI 33-102 describes a management process for developing architectures and plans, and it pro-
     vides general guidance in applying policy, standards, and resources to develop and maintain strategic
AFI33-101_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 5 APRIL 2005                                                          17


   plans. Certify all systems developed for joint operations, as defined by CJCSI 6212.01A, Compatibil-
   ity, Interoperability, and Integration of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelli-
   gence Systems, 30 June 1995, as interoperable with systems that they have a requirement to exchange
   information with. See AFI 33-108 for more information.
   3.2. Functional area offices survey their area of responsibility and then create functional and physical
   models to lay the foundation for developing plans and architectures. Develop strategic plans and
   ensure inclusion of supporting communications and information in mission area plans and mission
   support plans.
   3.3. Include information protection in all planning (see AFPD 33-2).
   3.4. Include communications services prewiring for all major and minor construction projects accord-
   ing to AFPD 32-10, Installations and Facilities, supporting publications, and HQ USAF Engineering
   Technical Letter 87-9, Prewiring.

4. Requirements Development. This instruction and AFI 33-103 cover requirements for new non-
developmental capabilities or to sustain existing systems with an expected acquisition cost of less than $5
million. Process requirements costing $5 million or more, requiring development, requiring an interface
to support joint operations, or specifically selected by HQ USAF, according to AFI 10-601 and manage
these requirements under the Air Force 63-series directives.
   4.1. Tenant units on Air Force installations coordinate with the supporting CSO to determine the
   impact of their required systems on the base infrastructure. The CSO and tenant organizations may
   negotiate a list of requirements that do not require CSO coordination. Tenant units requiring support
   from the host CSO submit requirements according to local procedures.
   4.2. The STEM-B reviews requirements impacting the base infrastructure. The STEM-B reviews
   technical solutions for these requirements and incorporates them into the base communications and
   information systems blueprint.
   4.3. After the CSO provides a technical solution that ensures architectural compliance, allocation of
   resources by the appropriate authority constitutes approval for implementation.

5. Project Implementation.
   5.1. CSOs must manage project implementation to deliver a product on time that fulfills the require-
   ment and is supportable throughout its life cycle. They must make sure project acquisition conforms
   to the law as reflected in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the Defense and Air Force FAR
   supplements, Air Force Acquisition circulars, and other applicable DoD and Air Force guidance.
   They ensure the use of competitive procurement practices to obtain resources at the lowest cost and
   offering the best value to the Air Force over the life cycle for all projects. They must plan projects
   under a phased, life-cycle oriented approach to implement, operate, and support the projects.
   5.2. The Implementing Activity Commander will:
       5.2.1. Designate a single project manager to head each project.
       5.2.2. Act as the project decision authority and oversee project accomplishments, actual cost, and
       progress.
       5.2.3. Reuse excess computer hardware and software where possible.
18                                     AFI33-101_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 5 APRIL 2005


            5.2.3.1. Do not develop new software unless quality, cost, performance, schedule, interopera-
            bility, and data-sharing goals established for the program or project cannot be met with com-
            mercial or nondevelopmental software.
        5.2.4. List all automated information system (AIS) software, developed by or for the Air Force, in
        the AFASI. Review or update the AFASI database on-line at http://year2000.af.mil, under the
        AFASI Database heading. Before selecting software development, search the AFASI for software
        that can be used to satisfy the requirement.
        5.2.5. Use DoD and Air Force infrastructure support contracts whenever possible.
        5.2.6. DELETED.
     5.3. The CSO:
        5.3.1. The CSO meets all Air Force computer needs, including network acquisitions, using DoD
        and Air Force infrastructure support contracts when possible, based on technical requirements,
        critical time constraints, or significant cost savings; however, MAJCOM CSOs may grant waiv-
        ers. Each waiver request must demonstrate why the user requirement should not be satisfied by
        the mandatory use contracts.
        5.3.2. The CSO or the program manager orders, receives, and accepts centrally managed national
        stock numbered resources and supplies according to AFMAN 23-110V2, Standard Base Supply
        Customer’s Procedures.
        5.3.3. The CSO or the program manager orders all communications and information equipment,
        to include hardware and software, through base supply or the supporting procurement office. The
        contracting office obligates funds only for those resources identified in the technical solution (i.e.,
        resulting from a CSRD, BPID, or as otherwise prescribed in AFI 33-103) or required for mainte-
        nance. When a CSO or program management office orders resources for distribution to other
        bases, they must notify the CSO and the user at the receiving base prior to ordering the resources.
        5.3.4. Accounts for computer hardware and software in the IPMS according to AFI 33-112. The
        CSO or user is responsible for government acceptance of the equipment.
        5.3.5. Coordinates with the STEM-B for development of the BPIDs and other project implement-
        ing directives.
     5.4. The using organization is responsible for installation of computer hardware and software unless
     it has made previous arrangements (such as vendor installation or CSO installation). The CSO and the
     using organization plan and execute installation requirements. When a computer system processes
     classified information, users must contact the base emission security (EMSEC) manager for specific
     EMSEC installation requirements.

6. Systems Operation and Support.
     6.1. IPMS. The IPMS is the official Air Force record of computer equipment authorization, inven-
     tory, transactions, and status. The CSO accounts for all computer equipment that cost more than $500
     and software that costs $5,000 or more in IPMS. When cost cannot be determined or equipment is
     obtained through the reuse program, account for computer equipment with a replacement value of
     $500 or more in IPMS. For registering computer system security accreditation, as a minimum the
AFI33-101_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 5 APRIL 2005                                                        19


  main central processing unit of each system must be included in the IPMS regardless of unit cost.
  Inventory all items annually.
  6.2. Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS). The AFEMS is the official inventory sys-
  tem and accounts for communications, electronics, and other equipment centrally managed by AFMC.
  The CSO assists users to account for their assets.
  6.3. Consolidation of Resources. Commanders at all levels consolidate assets to maximize resource
  effectiveness and reduce costs where mission requirements do not require redundancy.
  6.4. Contract Review. The program manager reviews systems support and service contracts annually.
  When systems or components require modernization to ensure cost-effective mission accomplish-
  ment, the system manager initiates the required programming and acquisition actions. Reviews will
  include:
     6.4.1. Determination of contractor performance.
     6.4.2. Cost and mission effectiveness.
     6.4.3. Essentiality of services.
     6.4.4. Identification of critical functions for contingency operations.
  6.5. Telephone Service. The Air Force provides telephone service for official use only. The Air
  Force offers service to unofficial users only in an emergency or when an installation cannot reason-
  ably obtain commercial service for its unofficial needs. See AFI 33-111, Telephone Systems Manage-
  ment, for more information.
  6.6. Computer Systems. Activities or individuals use only Air Force-owned or licensed software and
  hardware, unless authorized in the AFIs referenced below. Individuals using commercial off-the-shelf
  software must ensure they are using legally acquired software and are not violating copyright laws or
  other contractual agreements. Air Force activities use DoD and service-owned software and share Air
  Force-owned software when possible. Commanders may authorize use for personal projects in accor-
  dance with DoD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), with Change 3, December 12, 1997. See
  AFI 33-112; AFI 33-113, Managing Messaging and Data Processing Centers; and AFI 33-114, Soft-
  ware Management, for more information.
  6.7. Bulletin Boards. Activities may establish or subscribe to electronic bulletin boards to satisfy
  approved requirements. Information placed on an Air Force bulletin board, with unrestricted access,
  must be processed and approved for public release through the appropriate public affairs office. See
  AFI 33-129, Transmission of Information Via the Internet, for more information.
  6.8. Small Computer Contingency Use. Users often require their small computers during the exercise
  of contingency plans and deployments. Conduct operational tests of these plans to ensure support and
  security requirements are adequately addressed. Review AFI 33-112 for support considerations.
  6.9. Combat Communications Assets. While primarily for use during wartime, combat communica-
  tions assets are available for temporary peacetime use. The normal period of use is less than 120 days.
  Request support according to AFI 10-414, Requesting and Employing Combat Communications
  Resources in Peacetime.
  6.10. EI Products and Services. EI products and services are available for peacetime support of Air
  Force and DoD communications and information systems maintenance, engineering, installation,
20                                     AFI33-101_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 5 APRIL 2005


     relocation, and removal. EI assets are also available as unit type codes for wartime and contingency
     support (see AFMAN 33-105).
     6.11. Electronic Mail (E-mail). E-mail represents a unique communications medium between Air
     Force organizations and outside activities. Technological advancements have brought the opportunity
     for more timely, efficient, and effective communications using e-mail. Use e-mail to supplement or
     replace mail, facsimile, telephone, and other messaging systems. However, e-mail also carries inher-
     ent limitations and risks that you must address during the conduct of normal operations within the Air
     Force. See AFI 33-119, Electronic Mail (E-Mail) Management and Use, for more information.
     6.12. Internet. Using the internet has dramatically increased in popularity as a means of obtaining
     and disseminating information worldwide. See AFI 33-129 for more information about using public
     internet and web technology such as: web servers, web browsers, file transfer protocol, software pur-
     chased and licensed by the United States Air Force, or privately licensed software used with the
     proper approval on Air Force-owned systems. AFI 33-129 defines the roles and responsibilities of
     personnel using and maintaining internet access; outlines responsibilities and procedures for access-
     ing information and properly establishing, reviewing, posting, and maintaining government informa-
     tion on the internet; and covers responsibilities and procedures for sending e-mail across the internet.

and capabilities of a model or simulation and its supporting databases, control changes to those
capabilities, and document and report the changes. (JP 1-02) 2. A discipline applying technical and
administrative direction and surveillance to: (a) identify and document the functional and physical
characteristics of a C4 system; (b) to control changes of those characteristics and; (c) record and report
changes to processing and implementation status.
Communications and Information Systems Blueprint—Document that provides the requirements
engineering plan to modernize the base-level infrastructure with cost-effective, base-wide capability to
support digital transmission of voice, data, video, imagery, and telemetry needs. It documents the
baseline, identifies a target base configuration to support present and future requirements, and provides a
time-phased plan and estimated costs for logical transition.
Communications and Information Systems Officer (CSO)—The term CSO identifies the supporting
communications and information systems officer at all levels. At base-level, this is the commander of the
communications unit responsible for carrying out base systems responsibilities, the base CSO. Tenant
organizations may also have CSOs. At MAJCOM, and other activities responsible for large quantities of
assets, it is the person designated by the commander as responsible for overall management of assets
budgeted and funded by the MAJCOM or activity. The CSO function, when under the base
communications unit, uses the office symbol "SC" that expands to three and four digits to identify specific
functional areas.
Data Administrator—A person or group that ensures the utility of data used within an organization by
defining data policies and standards, planning for the efficient use of data, coordinating data structures
among organizational components, performing logical data base design, and defining data security.
Embedded Computers—Computer hardware and software that are an integral part of a product, where
the principal function of the product is not the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management,
movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information. An
embedded computer would require major modification to be used for general purpose computing and is
managed as a component of the system in which it is embedded (i.e., flight control computer within a
fighter aircraft).
Joint Technical Architecture (JTA)—A common set of mandatory information technology standards
and guidelines used in all new and upgraded DoD C4I acquisitions. The standards are used for sending
and receiving information, for understanding the information, and for processing that information. The
JTA also includes a common human-computer interface and “rules” for protecting the information. The
JTA draws on the TAFIM, which provides general guidance and documents the processes and framework
for defining the JTA and other technical architectures.
Lead Command—The MAJCOM or FOA assigned as systems advocate and oversight authority for
communications and information systems used by more than one command. Specific responsibilities of
the lead command are in AFI 10-901.
System Manager—A general term of reference to those organizations directed by individual managers,
exercising authority over the planning, direction, and control of tasks and associated functions essential
for support of designated weapons or equipment systems. The authority vested in this organization may
include such functions as research, development, procurement, production, materiel distribution, and
26                                   AFI33-101_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 5 APRIL 2005


logistic support, when so assigned. When intended to relate to a specific system manager, this term will
be prescribed by the appropriate designation (e.g., Chinook system manager, Sonar system manager, F-4
system manager). This term is normally used in lieu of system support manager, weapon system manager,
program manager, and project manager when such organizations perform these functions. (JP 1-02)
System Operational Manager—Lead organization responsible for day-to-day operations of a
MILSATCOM system. Normally designated as having primary responsibility for managing the system to
maximize the satisfaction of user communications requirements. (CJCS MOP No. 37)
Systems Telecommunications Engineering Manager (STEM)—A communications and information
engineer who provides technical engineering planning services in support of facilities and base
infrastructures. The STEM-B has technical responsibility for engineering management and assists the
base CSO in system engineering and configuration control. The STEM-C provides technical assistance to
the MAJCOM and coordinates with STEM-Bs on future MAJCOM mission changes, programs and
efforts at the MAJCOM-level. The STEM-J is assigned to CINCs, Joint Staff and DISA to promote
interoperability by providing an interface between those activities and the Air Force MAJCOMs and
bases. The STEM-TM assists the STEM-B and C.
Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management (TAF—IM) 1. A DISA center for
architecture multi-volume publication that provides guidance for the evolution of the DoD technical
infrastructure. The TAFIM does not provide a specific system architecture. It provides the services,
standards, design concepts, components, and configurations used to guide the development of technical
architectures that meet specific mission requirements. The TAFIM applies to information system
technical architectures at all DoD organizational levels and environments (tactical, strategic, sustaining
base). The TAFIM uses federal and national standards adopted by industry and international standards
accepted worldwide by U.S. allies. 2. The TAFIM, Version 2.0 consists of eight volumes: 1) Overview;
2) Technical Reference Model; 3) Architecture Concepts and Design Guidance; 4) DoD Standards-Based
Architecture Planning Guide; 5) Support Plan; 6) DoD Goal Security Architecture; 7) Information
Technology Standards Guidance; and 8) DoD Human Computer Interface Style Guide.
Technical Solution—A detailed and costed description of a system that satisfies the requirement, can be
incorporated into the base infrastructure, and is compliant with downward directed architectures and
standards.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change incorporates interim change (IC) 98-1, which provides updated guidance on listing software.
Changes the name of the AF Form 209, Communications and Information Management After-Action
Report, and adopts rather than prescribes the form. AFMAN 10-401V1, Operation Plan and Concept
Plan Development and Implementation, prescribes and provides detailed guidance for use and completion
of the form. Replaces paragraphs 1.3.2., 1.7., 2.1., 2.12., 5.2., 6.10., A2.9.3., and A2.9.4. Deletes para-
graphs 2.12.1., 2.12.2.and 8. Adds the term automated information system and acronym AIS and deletes
the term technical reference code and acronym TRC in Attachment 1. Deletes reference to AFMAN
33-125, Technical Reference Codes, and adds reference to AFMAN 33-105, Engineering and Installation
Services, and AFMAN 10-401V1, and changes the title of AFI 10-901, Lead Operating Command-Com-
munications and Information Management Systems throughout the document.


1.3.2. Appoint a MAJCOM C4I architect responsible for ensuring compliance with planning, require-
ments and architectural processes in all MAJCOM-wide systems and capabilities. Command architects
should develop architectures consistent with direction and guidance of Command, Control, Communica-
tions, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Architecture Framework pub-
lished by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense/C3I. When designated as the lead command,
the MAJCOM architect is also responsible for ensuring compliance of assigned systems. The MAJCOM
architect is usually the MAJCOM CSO (see AFIs 33-102, Command, Control, Communications, Comput-
ers, and Intelligence (C4I) Capabilities Planning Process; 33-103, Requirements Development and Pro-
cessing; 33-104, Base-Level Planning and Implementation; 33-108, Compatibility, Interoperability, and
Integration of Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) Systems; and 10-901, Lead

Terms
Acquisition Cost--The total cost to procure, test, and install a communications system. This does not
include operation and support costs beyond user acceptance of the system.
Air Force Functional Manager--The HQ USAF activity within a specific directorate responsible for
providing management oversight of the assigned function and its associated communications and infor-
mation systems.
Architecture--There are many different types of architectures, each with its own definition. The follow-
ing are the DoD-approved definitions. General Definition: A framework or structure that portrays rela-
tionships among all the elements of the subject force, subject, or activity. The standard definitions for
Operational, System, and Technical Architecture: Operational Architecture: A description of the tasks,
operational elements, and information flows required to accomplish or support a war-fighting function.
Systems Architecture: A description, including graphics, of the systems and interconnections providing
for or supporting a war-fighting function. Technical Architecture: A minimal set of rules governing the
arrangement, interaction, and interdependence of the parts or elements of a system, whose purpose is to
ensure that a conformant system satisfies a specific set of requirements.
Automated Information System (AIS)--A combination of information, computer, and telecommunica-
tions resources and other information technology and personnel resources that collect, record, process,
store, communicate, retrieve, and display information.

Base-Level Communications and Information Infrastructure--Communications and information sys-
tems used by host and tenant activities. They include voice, data, video transmission, switching, process-
ing, system control and network management systems, equipment, and facilities.
Blueprint Phased Implementation Directive (BPID)--Directs implementation of specific items of the
infrastructure requirements shown in the base communications and information systems blueprint.
Command, Control, Communications, and Computer System--An integrated system of doctrine, pro-
cedures, organizational structures, personnel, equipment, facilities, and communications designed to sup-
port a commander's exercise of command and control across the range of military operations. Also called
“C4 systems”. (Approved by JMTGM# 081-95). Within the Air Force, also called “communications and
information systems”.
Configuration Management--1. In computer modeling and simulation, a discipline of applying techni-
cal and administrative oversight and control to identify and document the functional requirements and
capabilities of a model or simulation and its supporting databases, control changes to those capabilities,
and document and report the changes. (JP 1-02) 2. A discipline applying technical and administrative
direction and surveillance to: (a) identify and document the functional and physical characteristics of a
C4 system; (b) to control changes of those characteristics and; (c) record and report changes to processing
and implementation status.
Communications and Information Systems Blueprint--Document that provides the requirements engi-
neering plan to modernize the base-level infrastructure with cost-effective, base-wide capability to sup-
port digital transmission of voice, data, video, imagery, and telemetry needs. It documents the baseline,
identifies a target base configuration to support present and future requirements, and provides a
time-phased plan and estimated costs for logical transition.
Communications and Information Systems Officer (CSO)--The term CSO identifies the supporting
communications and information systems officer at all levels. At base-level, this is the commander of the
communications unit responsible for carrying out base systems responsibilities, the base CSO. Tenant
organizations may also have CSOs. At MAJCOM, and other activities responsible for large quantities of
assets, it is the person designated by the commander as responsible for overall management of assets bud-
geted and funded by the MAJCOM or activity. The CSO function, when under the base communications
unit, uses the office symbol "SC" that expands to three and four digits to identify specific functional areas.
Data Administrator--A person or group that ensures the utility of data used within an organization by
defining data policies and standards, planning for the efficient use of data, coordinating data structures
among organizational components, performing logical data base design, and defining data security.
Embedded Computers--Computer hardware and software that are an integral part of a product, where
the principal function of the product is not the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management,
movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information. An
embedded computer would require major modification to be used for general purpose computing and is
managed as a component of the system in which it is embedded (i.e., flight control computer within a
fighter aircraft).
Joint Technical Architecture (JTA)--A common set of mandatory information technology standards and
guidelines used in all new and upgraded DoD C4I acquisitions. The standards are used for sending and
receiving information, for understanding the information, and for processing that information. The JTA
also includes a common human-computer interface and “rules” for protecting the information. The JTA

draws on the TAFIM, which provides general guidance and documents the processes and framework for
defining the JTA and other technical architectures.
Lead Command--The MAJCOM or FOA assigned as systems advocate and oversight authority for com-
munications and information systems used by more than one command. Specific responsibilities of the
lead command are in AFI 10-901.
System Manager--A general term of reference to those organizations directed by individual managers,
exercising authority over the planning, direction, and control of tasks and associated functions essential
for support of designated weapons or equipment systems. The authority vested in this organization may
include such functions as research, development, procurement, production, materiel distribution, and
logistic support, when so assigned. When intended to relate to a specific system manager, this term will
be prescribed by the appropriate designation (e.g., Chinook system manager, Sonar System Manager, F-4
System Manager). This term is normally used in lieu of system support manager, weapon system man-
ager, program manager, and project manager when such organizations perform these functions. (JP 1-02)
System Operational Manager--Lead organization responsible for day-to-day operations of a MILSAT-
COM system. Normally designated as having primary responsibility for managing the system to maxi-
mize the satisfaction of user communications requirements. (JCS MOP 37)
Systems Telecommunications Engineering Manager--A communications and information engineer
who provides technical engineering planning services in support of facilities and base infrastructures.
The STEM-B has technical responsibility for engineering management and assists the base CSO in sys-
tem engineering and configuration control. The STEM-C provides technical assistance to the MAJCOM
and coordinates with STEM-Bs on future MAJCOM mission changes, programs and efforts at the MAJ-
COM-level. The STEM-J is assigned to CINCs, Joint Staff and DISA to promote interoperability by pro-
viding an interface between those activities and the Air Force MAJCOMs and bases. The STEM-TM
assists the STEM-B and C.
Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management (TAFIM)--1. A DISA center for
architecture multi-volume publication that provides guidance for the evolution of the DoD technical infra-
structure. The TAFIM does not provide a specific system architecture. It provides the services, standards,
design concepts, components, and configurations used to guide the development of technical architectures
that meet specific mission requirements. The TAFIM applies to information system technical architec-
tures at all DoD organizational levels and environments (tactical, strategic, sustaining base). The TAFIM
uses Federal and National Standards adopted by industry and international standards accepted worldwide
by US allies. 2. The TAFIM, Version 2.0 consists of eight volumes: 1) Overview; 2) Technical Reference
Model; 3) Architecture Concepts and Design Guidance; 4) DoD Standards-Based Architecture Planning
Guide; 5) Support Plan; 6) DoD Goal Security Architecture; 7) Information Technology Standards Guid-
ance; and 8) DoD Human Computer Interface Style Guide.
Technical Solution--A detailed and costed description of a system that satisfies the requirement, can be
incorporated into the base infrastructure, and is compliant with downward directed architectures and stan-
dards.
