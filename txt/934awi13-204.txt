       2.19.2. RCR or Surface Friction Value Reports. The FAA has approved a number of
       different mechanical friction measuring devices for use at airports. The uses the Surface
       Friction Tester (high pressure tire [SFH]). The SFH measures surface friction on a scale
       from 0 to 1.00 where zero is the lowest friction and 1.00 is the theoretical maximum
       friction value attainable. These friction values are reported by (local NOTAM and/or
       MSP Field Condition Report) and ATC in terms of MU (pronounced “myew”). During
       winter operations, .38 is where braking action and directional control begin to deteriorate.
       As friction values decrease below .38, corresponding degraded braking action and
       directional control can be expected. A friction report of .38 or above should NOT be
       interpreted to mean that the braking action will be equivalent to a clean, dry runway. A
       value of .38 means that braking action and directional control are considered fair. A MU
       value of .37 or less is generally considered to mean that the aircraft will experience poor
       braking action and poor directional control. MU values below .16 indicate that the
       runway generally is not suitable for operations. ATC will report friction values for each
       one-third of the runway in the direction of takeoff and landing. An example of the format
       used by ATC is “Runway 12L, MU point three eight, point three zero, point four two at
       one zero one five Zulu, ice.”
       2.19.3. Runway Surface Friction Values (FAA and ICAO). Surface friction measuring
       devices that are recognized by the ICAO or approved by the FAA all provide essentially
       the same readings. ICAO reports include the type of device used to measure surface
       friction. FAA reports will express friction values in terms of the type of device used and
       the “MU”. An example of the format used in an FAA NOTAM is “MSP 12L SFH MU
       38/30/42 WEF 1311141015”
       2.19.4. Braking Action Reports. At times braking action reports may be reported by
       ATC in subjective terms of “Good”, “Fair”, “Poor”, and “NIL”. There is no engineering
       correlation between friction values and the subjective terms of good, fair, etc. However,
       all of the devices that are approved by the FAA or ICAO provide essentially the same
       information. The chart below represents an approximate relationship between these
       terms and friction values.

Table 7. Minneapolis-St Paul Intl Airport Runway Surface Friction Values.

       2.19.5. The above chart is used for informational purposes only. It is ultimately the
       aircraft commander’s decision whether the operational surface is safe for continued flight
       operations.
934AWI13-204 26 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  15


     2.19.6. Due to limited apron space, aircraft parking layout, and required vehicle speeds
     during braking action checks, RCR checks will not be conducted on the 934 AW apron.
     The following safety mitigation procedures will be utilized to the maximum extent
     possible during the snow/ice season (normally November – March).
         2.19.6.1. AM will report/record predominate apron surface conditions (e.g. snow,
         ice, slush, wet, etc) and depth. Apron surface conditions will be passed to CE,
         Operations Supervisor (AIRCREWs), MOC and Command Post.
         2.19.6.2. Aircraft scheduled to fly the next day will be parked in hangars if available.
         2.19.6.3. Aircrews will use extreme caution when taxiing on pavement surfaces that
         are other than dry. If necessary, use wing walkers to the maximum extent possible.
         2.19.6.4. Maintenance personnel towing aircraft on pavement surfaces that are other
         than dry will use extreme caution and follow towing guidance outlined in applicable
         technical orders.
         2.19.6.5. Aircraft remaining on the apron overnight will be parked on the outside
         (southern) row (spots 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8). This will allow CE to get an early start on
         snow removal operations (normally 0300L).
            2.19.6.5.1. CE will plow (remove) frozen precipitation on the apron from north to
            south.
            2.19.6.5.2. When required, CE will open lanes through the snow berm to allow
            maintenance personnel access to tow aircraft from the outside row to the inside
            (northern) row (spots 2, 2a, 4, 6 and 9).
         2.19.6.6. Local training flights will not be scheduled prior to 1100L (Nov – Mar).
         This will allow CE and warmer temperatures time to remove most (if not all) frozen
         precipitation from the apron surface prior to start of daily flight operations.
            2.19.6.6.1. If required, CE will plow a taxi lane from the aircraft parking spot out
            to Taxiway Romeo.
            2.19.6.6.2. If the apron surface condition is deemed unsafe to operate on by the
            aircraft commander, CE will plow a tow lane from the aircraft parking spot out to
            Taxiway Romeo.
  2.20. Procedures/requirements for conducting runway inspections/checks.
     2.20.1. MAC is responsible for conducting inspections/checks on all MSP-Intl Airport
     runways.
     2.20.2. In the event where 934 AW personnel require access onto the runways (e.g.
     aircraft emergency, etc) Airside Operations personnel will provide an escort.
  2.21. Engine Test/Run-up Procedures.
     2.21.1. Engine runs will only be conducted in designated engine run locations (see
     paragraph 2.15 listed above).
     2.21.2. The MOC shall contact the 934 AW Command Post with all engine run requests.
     Minimum information required is as follows:
16                                                      934AWI13-204 26 DECEMBER 2013


         2.21.2.1. Number of engines running and type of engine run (e.g. idle, full-power,
         etc)
         2.21.2.2. Fuel on Board.
         2.21.2.3. Number of personnel on Board.
         2.21.2.4. Duration.
     2.21.3. The Command Post will notify security forces. If the command post is closed the
     MOC shall notify security forces directly.
  2.22. Noise Abatement Procedures.
     2.22.1. The guidelines for the issuance of air traffic control instructions relating to noise
     abatement applies to all turbojet and all other Group IV (C-130) and V aircraft.
     2.22.2. Arriving aircraft will be vectored at 4,000 ft or higher until intercepting the
     glidepath unless a particular situation dictates otherwise.
     2.22.3. Whenever the normal pattern is over or the area, a noise sensitive message shall
     be added to the ATIS.
     2.22.4. Overhead approaches are authorized to runways 04, 30L, and 30R.
     2.22.5. Intersection departures – turbojet only. ATC shall ensure the intersection
     takeoffs, for turbojet aircraft, are not initiated when the departure path is over a noise
     sensitive area; e.g. departing runways 4, 30L, and 30R.
     2.22.6. Noise abatement procedures will be consistent with safe operating practices and
     will provide minimum noise levels over surrounding residential areas. During operations
     at airfields other than MSP, comply with established noise abatement procedures for that
     airfield as contained in FLIP or as issued by ATC.
  2.23. Protecting Precision Approach Critical Areas.
     2.23.1. The localizer and glideslope critical areas, when located on the are protected by
     instrument hold lines (Attachment 3).
     2.23.2. During inclement weather conditions (whenever conditions are less than reported
     ceiling 800 feet or visibility less than 2 miles [rotating beacon will be on]) aircraft and
     vehicle operators must contact MSP Tower and receive their approval prior to proceeding
     beyond critical area hold lines.
         2.23.2.1. Critical Area Hold Line Markings: Two solid parallel yellow lines with
         vertical yellow stripes (bordered in black). Critical Area Hold Lines are painted on
         all pavement areas within the that protect the localizer and glide slope critical areas.
  2.24. Restricted/Classified Areas on the Airfield.
     2.24.1. The 934 AW and 133 AW aprons are designated as restricted areas. Individuals
     must have a restricted area badge (AF Form 1199) or be escorted by someone who does
     before entering these areas.
     2.24.2. Maintenance Group personnel are responsible for surveillance of assets parked
     on the 934 AW apron or restricted areas during duty hours. Normally the MOC will
     inform Security Forces when the flightline has been opened or closed. During non-duty
934AWI13-204 26 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   17


     hours, weekends, holidays, or any other occasions when maintenance personnel are not
     performing duties on the aircraft parking apron, or maintenance facilities that contain
     aircraft, MOC will telephone Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC) and notify them
     that the responsibility for security surveillance of the restricted areas has been transferred
     to security forces. The airfield security patrol(s) will assume surveillance responsibilities
     until the MOC notifies BDOC that they are resuming security responsibilities. During
     that time, anyone approaching the restricted area will be challenged and identified.
     2.24.3. Except for approved flight operations, ground taxi and aircraft towing operations,
     MSP-Intl Airport (exception: 934 AW and 133 AW aprons) is off limits to all 934 AW
     personnel unless escorted by personnel.
  2.25. Procedures for Suspending and Resuming Runway Operations (Open Runway).
     2.25.1. General policy is to conduct maintenance operations in excess of five minutes on
     a closed surface.
     2.25.2. Runway suspensions necessitated because of unusual aircraft incidents/operations
     will be coordinated between MSP ATCT and MAC Airside Operations.
  2.26. Procedures for Opening and Closing the Runway.
     2.26.1. MAC will use the approved MSP surface closure process to determine the need
     for a surface (Runway) closure.
     2.26.2. MAC Airside Operations will issue and coordinate appropriate NOTAMs.
     2.26.3. MAC Airside Operations will close the runway using the appropriate ATC Local
     VHF frequency (123.95, 126.7 or 123.675). Airside operations is responsible for all
     runway closing and reopening communications with ATC. If the task is delegated to
     another department, ATC must be notified in advance and provided with the call sign of
     the designated party.
     2.26.4. MAC Airside Operations will advise that the runway is closed.
     2.26.5. Supervisors or personnel working on closed runways should verify with their
     personnel what surfaces are opened and closed and update them as conditions change.
     2.26.6. The agency/department the closure was coordinated for must check-in with
     airside operations prior to entering the runway surface safety area.             The
     department/agency must identify a POC for the work being done and advise airside
     operations of the POC’s call sign and how they may be reached (800 MHz radio or cell
     phone – number to be provided to airside operations). If 800 MHz is used, airside
     operations will determine what talk group the POC will be assigned for the work.
     2.26.7. Approved construction safety cones will be placed across the runway holding
     position markings on the closed runway for any intersecting open runways, prior to
     conducting maintenance and/or construction on the closed runway.
     2.26.8. The department/agency performing the construction/maintenance must delineate
     the boundaries of their work area using approved construction safety cones prior to
     beginning work. If needed, airside operations can provide assistance in identifying the
     work area boundaries.
 18                                                       934AWI13-204 26 DECEMBER 2013


      2.26.9. Any other agency/department wishing to also utilize the runway closure must
      check-in with airside operations prior to entering the runway safety area.
      2.26.10. Agencies/individuals must communicate clear of the closed runway to airside
      operations. Under no circumstances are agencies/individuals to report clear of the closed
      runway to ATC if the surface is closed.
      2.26.11. Prior to opening a runway, Airside Operations will conduct an inspection to
      confirm all entities are clear of the surface. Warning announcements of the runway
      opening are broadcast on the Metropolitan Airport Commission Airfield (MACAFALL)
      talk group.
      2.26.12. Airside operations will broadcast the runway surface is open on the appropriate
      ATC local VHF frequency (123.95, 126.7 or 123.675).

  3.2. Local Flying Area. The local flying area for the 934 AW consists of MN, ND, SD, IA,
  and WI.
  3.3. Designation of Airspace. The airport is designated as Class B airspace. Two-way radio
  communication is required prior to entering the Class B Airspace.
     3.3.1. The following is applicable to the MSP area.
         3.3.1.1. Mode C Veil. The airspace within 30 nautical miles of an airport listed in
         Appendix D, Section 1 of 14 CFR Part 91 (generally primary airports within Class B
         airspace areas), from the surface upward to 10,000 feet MSL. Unless otherwise
         authorized by ATC, aircraft operating within this airspace must be equipped with
         automatic pressure altitude reporting equipment having Mode C capability.
         3.3.1.2. However, an aircraft that was not originally certificated with an engine-
         driven electrical system or which has not subsequently been certified with a system
         installed may conduct operations within a Mode C veil provided the aircraft remains
         outside Class A, B or C airspace; and below the altitude of the ceiling of a Class B or
         Class C airspace area designated for an airport or 10,000 feet MSL, whichever is
         lower.
  3.4. VFR Local Training Areas. VR 1616, SR 727, SR 728, SR 729, SR 730 and SR 731 are
  within the 40 mile radius of the MSP-Intl Airport. Training flights are conducted daily in
  these areas by the 133 AW and 934 AW.
  3.5. VFR Procedures.
     3.5.1. VFR Weather Minimums. 1500 ft ceiling and 3 mile visibility for USAF aircraft.
     3.5.2. VFR Traffic Patterns. VFR overhead and straight-in recoveries are conducted at
     MSP. See Letter of Agreement (LOA) between MSP Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT),
     , 934 AW and 133 AW, dated 26 April 1998.
     3.5.3. Special Procedures.
         3.5.3.1. Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO). Allows civilian aircraft to
         operate on intersecting runways simultaneously. USAF fixed wing pilots are
         prohibited from accepting LAHSO clearances. Air Force pilots may passively
         participate in LAHSO (land or take-off when another aircraft has been given a
         LAHSO clearance).

4. Emergency Procedures.
   4.1. General: Specific procedures cannot be prescribed for every situation that might be
   considered an emergency. As a general rule, an emergency includes any situation, which
   places an aircraft, people and or property in danger or distress. If it is unclear whether a
   situation is an emergency, treat it as an emergency.
   4.2. Type of Declared Emergencies: When an aircrew declares an emergency it will be
   classified as one of the following:
      4.2.1. In-flight – emergencies that occur while airborne.
      4.2.2. Ground – emergencies that occur on the ground.
      4.2.3. Medical – emergencies involving the health of a crew member or passenger
      onboard.
   4.3. Operation of Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS) and Secondary Crash Net (SCN).
   MSP ARS does not have first responder capability and as such does not own or operate a
   PCAS or a SCN. The Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) responds to all civilian and
   military aircraft in-flight and ground emergencies.
      4.3.1. Emergency Response Procedures (In-Flight/Ground Emergencies/On/Off Base).
          4.3.1.1. Alternate PCAS procedures. In the event of an aircraft in-flight or ground
          emergency, the aircrew will contact MSP Tower who in turn notifies the ARFF. The
          aircrew also notifies the 934 AW Command Post (CP) who in turns notifies
          AM/Operations Supervisor and other base agencies via the AtHoc Network-Centric
          Emergency Mass Notification System.
          4.3.1.2. Alternate SCN procedures. For in-flight and ground emergencies on the
          runways or taxiways the aircrew will notify MSP Tower or Ground Control, as
          appropriate, (and 934 AW/CP and/or AM Ops/Operations Supervisor) who will
          notify ARFF. For ground emergencies on the 934 AW apron when aircrew are not
          on board the aircraft, maintenance personnel working on the parking apron will notify
          MOC. MOC will notify security forces (and the 934 AW/CP and/or AM
          Ops/Operations Supervisor) who will notify ARFF. The 934 AW/CP will notify
          base agencies via the AtHoc Network-Centric Emergency Mass Notification System.
          4.3.1.3. Off-base mishaps. When a report is received from a credible source (ATC
          Facility, Sheriff’s Department, etc) the 934 AW/CP (primary agency) or AM
          Ops/Operations Supervisor (secondary agency) will initiate Quick Reaction Checklist
          pertaining to Aircraft Mishap Accident/Incident (On/Off Base).
      4.3.2. Designation of the On-Scene Commander (OSC). The 934th MSG/CC is
      normally the designated OSC, if otherwise; the OSC will be designated by the
      installation commander. The OSC shall comply with the minimum guidelines established
      in MSP ARS Plan 10-2, Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan.
 24                                                   934AWI13-204 26 DECEMBER 2013


   4.4. External Stores/Cargo Jettison Procedures. The aircraft commander will determine the
   best course of action in an emergency situation. If time and conditions permit use R4301 or
   R4305 for emergency external stores/cargo jettison. See attachments 4 and 5.
   4.5. Fuel Dumping Procedures. The aircraft commander will determine the best course of
   action in an emergency situation. If time and conditions permit use R4301 or R4305 for
   emergency fuel dumping. See attachments 4 and 5.                           NOTE: External
   Stores/Cargo Jettison and Fuel Dumping require the Command Post to be notified prior to the
   event. If the emergency situation does not allow prior notification the Command Post must
   be notified as soon as the situation safely allows.
   4.6. Abandonment/Bailout of Aircraft. The aircraft commander will determine the best
   course of action in an emergency situation. If time and conditions permit use R4301 or
   R4305 for emergency abandonment/bailout of aircraft. See attachments 4 and 5.
   NOTE: If using R4301 for emergency operations the aircrew should contact Miller Tower
   (49.2 FM / 126.2 VHF (Primary) / 255.4 UHF), or Miller Ops (49.65 FM / 255.4 UHF). If
   unable to notify these agencies contact NORTHSTAR or VIKING OPS to notify Camp
   Ripley Post Security at DSN 871-7375, Com (320) 632-7375. Post Security will make
   emergency notifications as required.
   4.7. Emergency Arresting/Barrier Gear Procedures. Aircraft emergencies involving little or
   no brake support will utilize Runway 12R to the maximum extent possible. Runway 12R is
   equipped with an EMAS at the departure end.
   4.8. Hot Brake Area and Procedures. Designated hot brake areas are as follows:

Table 9. Minneapolis-St Paul Intl Airport Designated Hot Brake/Hung Ordinance Areas.

for the landing runway will be used.

       4.8.1. The aircrew will notify MSP ATCT if they are declaring a ground emergency or
       are unable to move the aircraft. The aircrew will also notify 934 AW Command Post.
934AWI13-204 26 DECEMBER 2013                                                             25


     4.8.2. Upon notification from MSP ATCT, MAC Airside Operations will initially close
     the affected location (runway, taxiway, apron, etc). Once ARFF assesses the situation,
     airside operations will determine which surfaces can be reopened.
  4.9. Personnel/Crash Locator Beacon Signal/Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELT).
     4.9.1. In the event MSP ATCT contacts the 934 AW (e.g. Command Post, AM,
     Operations Supervisor, etc) about an signal, the contacted agency shall contact the MOC
     to assess whether any of the 934 AW aircraft have in operation and no maintenance is
     being performed.
     4.9.2. If applicable, have MOC check transient aircraft on our apron.
     4.9.3. Notify MSP ATCT of the results of the search.
