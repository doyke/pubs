                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. This Air Force Instruction (AFI) provides policy for Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)
   Operations. It is an original source document for many areas but, for efficacy, restates
   information found in aircraft flight manuals, flight information publications (FLIP), and other
   Air Force directives. When guidance in this AFI conflicts with another basic/source
   document, that document takes precedence. For matters where this AFI is the source
   document, waiver authority is in accordance with (IAW) paragraph 1.4.2 For matters where
   this AFI repeats information in another document, follow waiver authority outlined in the
   basic/source document.
   1.1.2. Mission. The mission of AE is to provide time-sensitive en route care of regulated
   casualties to and between medical treatment facilities, using organic and/or contracted
   aircraft with medical aircrew trained explicitly for this mission. AE forces can operate as far
   forward as aircraft are able to conduct air operations, across the full range of military
   operations, and in all operating environments.
   1.1.3. Unit commanders (AE and MTF) and Command and Control (C2) agency directors of
   Patient Movement Requirements Center (PMRC), 618 AOC ( TACC), and Air and Space
   Operations Center (AOC) shall make current copies of this AFI available to appropriate
   personnel. Transportation and base operations passenger manifesting agencies will maintain
   a current copy of this AFI. This AFI will be used by all units and agencies involved in or
   supporting AE operations. Copies will be current and available to planning staff from HQ to
   aircrew level.
   1.1.4. Airlift Resources. The primary USAF aircraft supporting intratheater AE are the C-
   130 Hercules, C-17 Globemaster, C-21 and the KC-135 Stratotanker. Overseas theater
   commanders have operational control of theater-assigned or attached aircraft through the
   Airlift Operations Center (AOC), who allocates those airframes as required to meet
   operational mission requirements. Primary intertheater aircraft are KC-135 Stratotanker, and
   the C-17 Globemaster.
   1.1.5. Opportune Airlift. Opportune airlift is preferred to launching a special airlift aircraft.
   C-5 Galaxy and the KC-10 Extender can be used when available and if suitable to meet
   patient requirements. The C2 agency should direct the move. Use of opportune airlift is
   considered an unscheduled AE mission, and managed/reported in the same manner as any
   other AE mission, to include the change of the mission number when patient(s) is/are
   onboard. Aeromedical Evacuation Crewmembers (AECMs) on these missions will be
   universally qualified and follow quick response training IAW AFI 11-2AE V1, Aeromedical
   Evacuation Aircrew Training.
   1.1.6. Patient Preparation. A theater validating flight surgeon (FS), will determine the
   patient's suitability for AE. Medical authorities requesting the patient's evacuation must be
   informed of the impact of in-flight physical stresses on the patient. In the event the Medical
   Crew Director (MCD) has determined a patient is not stable/stabilized, is at significant risk
   for flight, or requires care beyond the scope of the AE crew, the MCD will contact the
 12                                                               AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


   MAJCOM sponsored AOC to coordinate with the PMRC before refusing the patient.
   Depending on the contingency/tactical environment, refusing a patient for flight may not be
   applicable.
   1.1.7. In determining the risk for the patient in flight versus remaining in place,
   consideration must be given to the medical capability of the sending facility, the receiving
   AE crew, and the current operational situation. (T-1)
   1.1.8. Determining Factors. Consider the following factors when transporting patients on
   aircraft; patient's diagnosis, condition, equipment, oxygen requirements, in-flight time, in-
   flight patient care requirements, the number of medical personnel required, and whether
   patients can tolerate multiple stopovers and or Remain Over Night (RON). Emphasis must
   always be on providing quality, safe and appropriate care while minimizing potential risks
   during transport. (T-1)
   1.1.9. Patient Load Planning Factors. The tasking C2 agency (PMRC, 618 AOC (TACC),
   etc.) determines the size/composition of the patient load on AE missions IAW this instruction
   and AFI 11-2AE V3 Addenda A, Aeromedical Evacuation Operations
   Configuration/Mission Planning. (T-1)
   1.1.10. AECMs prepare for the AE mission during peacetime by:
      1.1.10.1. Organizing, training and equipping assigned personnel.
      1.1.10.2. Exercising and evaluating contingency AE capabilities.
      1.1.10.3. Identifying medical and support equipment necessary to meet mission
      requirements.
   1.1.11. Aircraft Availability. AE missions are supported by:
      1.1.11.1. Dedicated aircraft (scheduled or designated channel missions).
      1.1.11.2. In system select (ISS - opportune aircraft).
      1.1.11.3. Patient/cargo mix missions.
   1.1.12. In all cases, use of specific aircraft are based on:
      1.1.12.1. Specific clinical requirements.
      1.1.12.2. Specific AE equipment needs.
      1.1.12.3. Timeliness of patient movement.
      1.1.12.4. Airfield constraints.
      1.1.12.5. Aircraft availability.
      1.1.12.6. Financial constraints.
1.2. Applicability. This AFI applies to aircrew members, support personnel, and managers
involved with employing Aeromedical Evacuation.

                                           Chapter 2

                                COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The Mobility Air Forces (MAF) command and control (C2) network consists of
the following C2 centers: 618 Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), (Tanker Airlift Control
Center) (TACC), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) or United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) Air
and Space Operations Centers (AOCs), Air National Guard (ANG) Readiness Center, Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC) Command Center, theater AOCs, Air Mobility Division (AMD),
Joint Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC), Special Air Missions Division, Office of
Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, USAF (CVAM), Unit Command Posts, Air Mobility Control
Centers (AMCC), Contingency Response Groups (CRG), Contingency response Elements
(CRE), and Special Tactics Teams (STT). C2 centers are action agents for the MAF commander
with execution authority (operational control) over mobility missions/forces.
   2.1.1. HQ AMC is the lead command for worldwide AE. HQ AMC Directorate of
   Operations (AMC/A3) is the executive agent for operational AE missions.
   2.1.2. AE crewmembers serve in the following commands: Air Mobility Command (AMC),
   United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), Air Force
   Reserve Command (AFRC), and National Guard Bureau (NGB). AMC is the gaining
   MAJCOM for all non-theater assigned AE forces.
       2.1.2.1. HQ AMC/A3/SG establishes, in coordination with the AFRC, NGB and other
       MAJCOMs, the standards for system-wide organization, equipage and training of the AE
       force.
       2.1.2.2. Total Force, multi-command coordination ensures standards for system-wide AE
       crew and AE mission support training requirements, for clinical and in-flight care, and
       for AE crew performance.
       2.1.2.3. HQ AMC Command Surgeon is responsible for standardization of medical and
       nursing policies and procedures, clinical training, patient safety, and quality programs for
       the evaluation of care provided in the en route care system.
2.2. Execution Authority. Headquarters commanders with command authority over MAF
resources hold execution authority for directed missions. Commanders with execution authority
formulate plans, allocate assets, and approve missions through a local command post or C2
element. OG/CCs serve as execution authority for local training missions. The pilot in
command (PIC) will execute missions operating outside normal communication channels (use
last known mission orders or best course of action). C2 of AE missions is the same as for any
other airlift missions. (T-1)
2.3. Pilot in Command (PIC)/Aeromedical Evacuation Crew (AEC) Responsibility and
Authority. SQ/CCs shall designate an aircraft commander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), evaluator
pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights, on a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation
Management, and applicable supplements. (T-1)
   2.3.1. PICs are:
       2.3.1.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.

     2.3.1.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only
     fly events authorized in the mission tasking unless, in the PIC’s judgment, an emergency
     condition demands otherwise. Fly unscheduled training events (for example, Air-to-Air
     Refueling (AAR) or transition training) after obtaining approval of the execution
     authority.
     2.3.1.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher
     authority.
     2.3.1.4. The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
     2.3.1.5. Responsible for passing mission progress reports (at least daily) to C2 agents.
     2.3.1.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support
     personnel and will establish a point-of-contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior
     to entering crew rest. Local C2 agents are responsible for coordinating mission support
     requirements on the PIC’s behalf.
     2.3.1.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Personnel
     (MEP), passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
  2.3.2. AE SQ/CCs shall designate a MCD on a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401,
  and applicable supplements.
     2.3.2.1. MCD is a qualified flight nurse responsible for the overall supervision of patient
     care and management of AEC assigned to AE missions. He/she advises the PIC on
     patients’ conditions and the use of medical equipment that may affect aircraft operations.
     The MCD is directly responsible for the safety and medical well-being of patients on the
     aircraft and coordinates enplaning and deplaning procedures with supporting agencies. In
     matters of patient care, the decisions of the MCD are final.
     2.3.2.2. Charge Medical Technician (CMT) is a qualified Aeromedical Evacuation
     Technician (AET) responsible for the supervision and management of AETs assigned to
     perform duties on the mission. The CMT will ensure that medical supplies and
     equipment are on the aircraft and installed equipment is operational.
     2.3.2.3. Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT). Each CCATT consists of one
     intensive or non-intensive physician (as the situation dictates), one critical care nurse, and
     one cardiopulmonary craftsman specially trained to provide critical care/specialty care
     during aeromedical transport. They represent a specialty or critical care team that can
     augment an AE crew in order to offer a higher level of care to stabilized patients during
     AE staging and flight. The CCATT utilizes basic AE equipment, and enhances treatment
     capability with expanded drugs and ventilation equipment. CCATTs have no stand-alone
     electrical or mechanical equipment.
     2.3.2.3.1. During mission execution, CCATTs will organizationally align under the AE
     command structure, and will be a supporting element of the staging facility or any AE
     element. The CCATT physician is the clinical authority during missions, and with the
     other team members, is responsible for documenting and providing care; they may be
     called upon to consult and/or assist in the care of other patients. When in-flight, the
     CCATT works with and receives mission operational direction from the MCD. The
     mission operational management authority and responsibility remains with MCD.

2.4. Not Used.
2.5. Operational C2 Reporting. C2 facilities (i.e. command post, AMD etc.…) will normally
transmit arrival, departure, and advisory messages to the mission’s regional controlling C2 agent.
Aircrews on 618 AOC (TACC)-controlled missions are responsible for transmitting these
messages via L-Band SATCOM, HF, DSN, etc., when transiting stations without an AMC C2
(fixed or mobile) presence. Crews on missions not controlled by 618 AOC (TACC) will report to
their appropriate controlling C2 agency. (T-1)
   2.5.1. Stations with MAF C2 Agency. Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data
   (arrival, departure, and advisory messages) in the MAF C2 system.
       2.5.1.1. Crews not on AMC missions will report to their appropriate C2 agency, i.e.
       AOC/AMD.
   2.5.2. Stations without MAF C2 Agency. Transmit mission data (arrival, departure, and
   advisory messages) to the controlling C2 agency by any means available (preference in the
   following order DSN, Airline Operational Control (AOC), HF, Iridium Phone, AERO-I).
   For critical C2 communications, i.e. aircraft waiver request, maintenance delay, etc., voice
   communications are the primary method. (T-1)
   2.5.3. Enroute Reporting. (T-1)
       2.5.3.1. Make the following enroute calls to 618 AOC (TACC):
           2.5.3.1.1. Airborne call when departing from a location without an AMC presence.
           2.5.3.1.2. Maintenance call whenever aircraft alpha status changes to code 3.
           2.5.3.1.3. On aeromedical evacuation (AE) missions, no later than 1 hour prior to
           landing, to update arrival time and provide AF IMT 3858, Aeromedical Evacuation
           Mission Offload Message information.
       2.5.3.2. CONUS. Periodic “ops normal” calls/transmissions are not required; however,
       the controlling C2 agency may increase reporting requirements.
       2.5.3.3. OCONUS. MAJCOM C2 agencies will specify increased reporting procedures
       through a communications plan in the Operation Plan (OPLAN), Operation Order
       (OPORD), Fragmentation (FRAG), Mission Directive, or FLIP. Aircrews will maintain
       listening watch in accordance with the communications plan within aircraft equipment
       capabilities (e.g. HF-Automatic Link Establishment (HF-ALE), Iridium Phone, AOC,
       AERO-I).
2.6. Not Used.
2.7. Not Used.
2.8. C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. Units should publish a listing of telephone numbers to
assist crews in coordinating mission requirements through appropriate C2 agencies. It should be
made readily available to crews and published in the FCB, Read File, or other appropriate
publication. Table 2.1 contains a list of 618 AOC (TACC) phone numbers. Crewmembers may
also use the 618 AOC (TACC) toll-free number, 1-800-AIR-MOBL or DSN 312-779-0320 to

                       AIRCREW COMPLEMENT/MANAGEMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides guiding principles to form/manage mobility aircrews.
Commanders at all levels shall follow this policy to form aircrews and to develop aircrew related
work/rest schedules that optimize efficiency of mobility forces engaged in worldwide operations.
(T-1)
3.2. Aircrew Complement. SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on fragmentation order/mission
directive, Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP) requirements, aircrew member
qualifications, and other constraints to safely accomplish the mission tasking. NOTE:
Augmented aircrew members must be current, qualified and Mission Ready (MR) in accordance
with AFI 11-2AE, V1. In those situations requiring augmentation, the crew will be augmented
from the start of the duty period. MAJCOM/A3/DO approval is required for crewmembers to
join the mission en route for augmentation. If augmentees join the mission en route, the crew’s
FDP will be computed based on the FDP of the most limited person. (T-1)

          (CCATT), the AE crew may be limited to one (1) AECM due to weight and space
          limitations.
3.3. Aircrew Member Qualification. An aircrew member will be qualified or in qualification
training to perform duties as a primary aircrew member.
   3.3.1. Aeromedical Evacuation Crewmember. An individual who meets all the following:
       3.3.1.1. Is a non-rated aircrew member as explained in AFPD 11-4, Aviation Service,
       specifically trained to operate safely during ground and flight operations of the aircraft
       and is proficient with onboard emergency procedures and operation of emergency
       equipment. Individuals must be on aeronautical orders and perform their principal duties
       in-flight. Duties must be essential to performing patient care and operating associated
       equipment used for completing a mission.
       3.3.1.2. Is required for the mission as described in AFI 11-401.
       3.3.1.3. Is designated on the flight authorization to fulfill specific aeronautical tasks.
3.4. Not Used.
3.5. Not Used.
3.6. Not Used.
3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and en route C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles are
adequate to permit an aircrew time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for
rest.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP). FDP is the time period starting at mission report time and
   ending immediately after the aircrew completes the final engine shutdown of the day.
   SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Once en
   route, the mission directive or C2 agent will inform the MCD of expected FDP at show time.
   (T-1)
       3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew is 14-16 hours (see
       Table 3.2). Once an aircrew begins a basic FDP, only MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend to
       augmented day regardless of aircrew composition (MAJCOM/A3/DO shall augment
       basic crew to extend FDP).
          3.7.1.1.1. When extended en route ground times, non-optimum routing/winds,
          weather delays or other extenuating circumstances will increase a basic to an
          augmented FDP, the PIC with an augmented crew may accept an augmented FDP as
          long as:
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                               21


        3.7.1.1.2. The C2 agent or PIC discovers the extenuating circumstances before the
        first takeoff of the day.
        3.7.1.1.3. The PIC verifies all augmenting aircrew members can get adequate rest en
        route.
        3.7.1.1.4. The PIC with a basic crew may seek MAJCOM/A3/DO (mission execution
        authority) approval to extend the FDP as much as 2 hours to complete a scheduled
        mission. Only use this provision to recover from unscheduled/unplanned en route
        delays. C2 agents shall not ask the PIC to exercise this option. (T-1)
     3.7.1.2. Augmented Crew FDP. Maximum FDP for an augmented aircrew is 18-24 hours
     (see Table 3.2).
        3.7.1.2.1. SQ/CC or designee will augment an aircrew when FDP exceeds 16 hours
        and the mission profile will allow augmenting aircrew members adequate time to rest
        en route. Two additional litter spaces will be reserved for only crew rest purposes
        when crew augmentation for time is required. (T-1)
        3.7.1.2.2. Physicians, nurses, medical technicians, or other personnel designated as
        medical attendants (i.e. CCATT members) assigned to specific patients do not
        constitute an augmented AE crew and will not extend crew duty time. NOTE: AFTO
        Form 781 Documentation Procedures: When AE crews are augmented for time, only
        five personnel will log primary time when accomplishing flight duties. When
        crewmembers are in rest cycles, log other time. Reference AFI 11-401 for further
        guidance. (T-1)
     3.7.1.3. Supplemented Crew (N/A for C-21). The CNE may adjust the crew complement
     to meet patient acuity and en route nursing care requirements based on ORM Worksheet.
     If the AE crew must be supplemented due to patient acuity or large patient loads,
     additional AECMs will be added. Number of AECMs and AFSC may vary. For example,
     an additional FN and AET may be added for large patient loads or 2 additional FNs may
     be added to assist with increased medication administration requirements. Notify
     controlling C2 agency if additional AECMs are required. (T-1)
     3.7.1.4. Basic or augmented crews may be supplemented. NOTE: AFTO Form 781
     Documentation Procedures: When AE crews are supplemented for patient acuity; all
     personnel will log primary time. Reference AFI 11-401 for further guidance. (T-1)
     3.7.1.5. Flight examiners administering evaluations will not exceed an augmented FDP.
     (T-1)

Table 3.2. AE Duty Periods.




   3.7.2. CDT. CDT is that period of time an aircrew may perform combined ground/flight
   duties. Plan the mission so aircrew members may complete post-mission duties within
   maximum CDT. An aircrew member may perform mission-related duties for other missions
   when approved by member’s home station SQ/CC or equivalent. See Table 3.2 for MDS
   specific maximum CDT for a basic aircrew.
   3.7.3. Except as outlined below, CDT/FDP begins 1 hour after aircrew alert notification.
   SQ/CC or equivalent may task aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin
   flight-related duties or MAJCOM/A3/DO may authorize a C2 agent to alert an aircrew
   member early: begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for those duties. For
   AECMs, CDT ends when the patients have been delivered to the receiving medical
   representative and/or when aircraft medical equipment has been secured, whichever is later.
   If the mission will Remain Over Night (RON), the PIC and MCD will coordinate alert/take-
   off time based on the latest crewmember CDT end point. (T-1)
      3.7.3.1. Crews may self-alert with C2 (618 AOC (TACC) for AMC and AMC gained
      missions) concurrence prior to entering crew rest. The PIC must coordinate (618
      AOC/TACC approval required for AMC and AMC-gained missions) the self-alert time
      before entering crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for
      duty. (T-1)
      3.7.3.2. ANG and AFRC crews may perform mission-related events on local training
      missions provided their time from start of CDT/FDP does not exceed 16 hours. NOTE:
      (AFRC/ANG) CDT/FDP includes both military and civilian work. It begins when the
      individual reports for his or her first duty period (military or civilian).
      3.7.3.3. CDT/FDP Extensions. See AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
   3.7.4. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) Time. IAW AFI 11-401, MAF aircrew members
   may travel as additional crewmembers (not required for the mission being flown but required
   for follow-on missions) as MEP. MEP will not be listed on the AFTO Form 781, will not log
   time, and will not accrue OFDA credit. Crewmembers may travel as MEP for a maximum of
   24 hours. OG/CC or equivalent may approve crewmembers to travel as MEP in excess of 24
   hours.
      3.7.4.1. Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after
      traveling in MEP status, provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at report
      time for flight in MEP status.
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                   23


      3.7.4.2. Aircrew members may travel in MEP status after performing primary crew
      duties, for a maximum of 24 hours from the time the crewmember‘s FDP began.
   3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo up-/off-
   load, start, and taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3. The duty day begins
   when the aircrew member reports for official duties.
3.8. Scheduling Restrictions. IAW AFI 11-202V3. SQ/CCs shall not schedule an aircrew
member to fly nor will an aircrew member perform aircrew duties:
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3,
   General Flight Rules. (T-1)
   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff, or
   ALPHA standby force legal for alert time, or earliest show time from BRAVO alert) or while
   impaired by its after effects. (T-1)
   3.8.3. Within 12 hours following a hypobaric (altitude) chamber flight above 25,000 feet
   MSL. Aircrew members may fly as passengers during this period provided the mission is
   planned for no more than a 10,000 foot MSL cabin altitude. An aircrew member who
   participates in an altitude chamber flight to, at, or below 25,000 feet may fly without delay
   (primary/deadhead) as long as subsequent cabin altitude does not exceed 15,000 feet. (T-1)
   3.8.4. Within 24 hours after compressed gas diving (scuba or surface supplied diving), a
   hyperbaric (compression) chamber mission, or aircraft pressurization checks that exceed 10
   minutes. Aircrew members will not perform multiple pressurization checks. (T-1)
   3.8.5. Within 72 hours of donating blood. Aircrew members in mobility positions or subject
   to flying duties within 72 hours may donate blood with SQ/CC approval (donation requires a
   72 hour Duties Not to Include Flying (DNIF) period). (T-1)
   3.8.6. When taking medication of any kind unless specifically cleared by a flight surgeon or
   when an aeromedical waiver has been granted by the appropriate waiver authority. IAW AFI
   48-123 and the Aerospace Medicine Approved Medications list (available from the flight
   surgeon’s office), certain medications and topical treatments may be used without flight
   surgeon consultation. (T-1) These include:
      3.8.6.1. Skin antiseptic, topical anti-fungal, 1 percent Hydrocortisone cream, or benzyl
      peroxide for minor wounds and skin diseases which do not interfere with the performance
      of flying duties or wear of personal equipment.
      3.8.6.2. Single dose of over-the-counter aspirin, acetaminophen or ibuprofen to provide
      analgesia for minor self-limiting conditions that do not impede performance of aircrew
      duties.
      3.8.6.3. Antacid for mild isolated episodes of indigestion.
      3.8.6.4. Hemorrhoidal suppositories.
      3.8.6.5. Bismuth subsalicylate for mild cases of diarrhea.
      3.8.6.6. An aircrew member shall only use dietary/herbal supplements, to include
      multivitamins, following specific (name brand and/or ingredient) approval of a FS.
 24                                                         AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


      3.8.6.7. An aircrew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays
      following an unexpected ear or sinus block during flight. Do not use these products to
      treat symptoms of head congestion that exist before flight.
   3.8.7. Immunizations: Crewmembers are DNIF for a period of 4 hours after receiving most
   immunizations. An AF Form 1042 is not required (i.e. verbal DNIF is authorized). If an
   adverse reaction occurs, the individual is considered DNIF until cleared by a flight surgeon.
   (T-1)
3.9. Fatigue Countermeasures Management Program.
   3.9.1. AMC/A3 will establish policy for implementation of the Fatigue Countermeasures
   (CM) Program and ensure compliance with its provisions. AMC/SG will provide clinical
   oversight, guidance and materials for fatigue CM education and mitigation. (T-1)
   3.9.2. OG/CCs will ensure Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs include use
   of the basic fatigue countermeasures found in the AE ORM worksheet. Both the manual and
   automated “MAF Mission Aviation ORM Worksheet” incorporate a fatigue CM risk
   assessment model. They are available on the AMC/A3V website under the “Pubs” tab,
   “Operational Risk Management (ORM)” section and will be used by all three tiers of mission
   planners, as well as aircrew during the mission execution phase. (T-1)
   3.9.3. Flight surgeons will use the AMC-approved (lead command) fatigue CM training CDs
   and pamphlets provided by AMC/SGP to educate their operational fliers in venues such as
   clinic visits, flight physicals, Safety Down Days, pre-deployment briefings, readiness
   training, Commanders' Calls, First-Term Airmen Courses, base orientations and safety
   meetings. (T-1)
   3.9.4. The primary fatigue CM available to aircrew members is appropriate management of
   their sleep/rest cycles. Secondary CM include smart scheduling procedures aimed at
   managing those cycles, strategic inflight and/or ground napping techniques, and proper diet
   and exercise.
   3.9.5. An additional fatigue CM tool available to aircrew is the No-Go Pill. The occasional
   use of a No-Go Pill by MAF aircrew to improve sleep quality and/or adjust circadian rhythm
   sleep/wake cycles is voluntary. Each individual aircrew member will, with the aid of their
   home station flight surgeon, determine how/if to implement the use of No-Go Pills as a
   fatigue CM. (T-1)
   3.9.6. The following directives concerning the use of No-Go Pills are as important and
   unbreakable as the “12 hour bottle to throttle” restriction for alcohol consumption:
      3.9.6.1. Aircrew members on flight orders will not use No-Go Pills in flight. (T-1)
      3.9.6.2. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for any No-Go Pill they wish to
      use for operational purposes, documented using MAF No-Go Pill Form 1, Ground
      Testing of No-Go Pills (attached below). In order to avoid possible drug interactions,
      aircrew members will inform the flight surgeon of any over-the-counter medications
      and/or nutritional supplements they are taking. During ground testing, aircrew members
      will be DNIF on an AF Form 1042 for the minimum ‘DNIF’ periods prescribed in
      paragraph 6.d. below. After ground testing of a particular No-Go Pill, the flight surgeon
      will complete the bottom half of the Form 1 and a “return to fly” AF Form 1042.
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                    25


     Successful ground testing of a particular No-Go Pill establishes clearance to use it
     operationally. (T-1)
     3.9.6.3. Aircrew members may obtain NoGo Pills from any USAF or other authorized
     flight surgeon while at home station or off-station while TDY/deployed. Off-
     station/deployed flight surgeons can verify individual aircrew ground testing results via
     the “MAF Aircrew Medication Ground Test Card” all MAF aircrew members are
     required to carry. (T-1)
     3.9.6.4. In no case will an individual perform aircrew duties while under the effects of
     No-Go Pills. Individuals will use the mission report or legal for alert time to determine
     the latest time to take a No-Go Pill. The following are the minimum ‘DNIF’ periods (no
     AF Form 1042 required) after consuming a No-Go Pill: (T-1)
        3.9.6.4.1. Sonata (Zaleplon) – 4 hours minimum ‘DNIF’
        3.9.6.4.2. Ambien (Zolpidem) – 6 hours minimum ‘DNIF’
        3.9.6.4.3. Restoril (Temazepam, Class IV Controlled Substance) – 12 hours
        minimum ‘DNIF’ NOTE: No-Go medications can affect individuals very
        differently. To comply with the “no aircrew duties while under the effects”
        restriction, it is the responsibility of each individual aircrew member to be aware of
        their own minimum ‘DNIF’ period for any No-Go Pill they use, based on their
        ground trial results and/or previous experiences.
     3.9.6.5. Aircrew members will consider the following examples of missions prone to
     causing fatigue and/or sleep disruptions in their decision to use a No-Go Pill: (T-1)
        3.9.6.5.1. Home station night launch missions with 2000-0530L show times and
        greater than four hours duration.
        3.9.6.5.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal (i.e., quiet, air-conditioned,
        darkened) sleeping environment.
        3.9.6.5.3. Off-station missions that are four or more time zones from home station.
        3.9.6.5.4. Rotating or stair-stepped flying schedules with greater than 6-hour flight
        time duration.
        3.9.6.5.5. Missions that run consistently near a 12 to 14 hour duty day.
     3.9.6.6. The MAF’s worldwide mobility mission makes accountability for this program
     challenging; therefore, the following are aircrew member responsibilities:
        3.9.6.6.1. Aircrew members will not operate heavy equipment during the minimum
        ‘DNIF’ period for each No-Go Pill outlined in paragraph 3.9.6.4 above. (T-1)
        3.9.6.6.2. Aircrew members will not take No-Go Pills within 12 hours of consuming
        alcohol, as their combined use unpredictably increases the effects of both. (T-1)
        3.9.6.6.3. Aircrew members will limit use of Ambien (Zolpidem) and Restoril
        (Temazepam) to a maximum of seven consecutive days and no more than 20 days in
        a 60-day period. To optimally support dynamic AMC mission requirements, flight
        surgeons should provide a prescription for 60 days’ worth of medication (20 pills) at a
        time if requested by the aircrew member, unless clinically inadvisable. (T-1)
 26                                                           AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


          3.9.6.6.4. Aircrew members will limit use of Sonata (Zaleplon) to a maximum of 10
          consecutive days and no more than 28 days in a 60-day period. To optimally support
          dynamic AMC mission requirements, flight surgeons should provide a prescription
          for 60 days’ worth of medication (28 pills) at a time if requested by the aircrew
          member, unless clinically inadvisable. (T-1)
          3.9.6.6.5. If an aircrew member uses Sonata in combination with either of the other
          types of No-Go Pills, the seven consecutive days and 20-days in a 60 day period
          restrictions apply (overrides the 10 consecutive days and 28 days in a 60-day period
          for Sonata).
          3.9.6.6.6. Aircrew members may consume more than one No-Go Pill in a 24-hour
          period, if operationally necessary. A second No-Go Pill of the same or different type
          will not be consumed while in the minimum ‘DNIF’ period for the previous one. (T-
          1)
          3.9.6.6.7. The “MAF No-Go Pill Usage/Refill Form” will be used to document No-
          Go Pill use and refill authorization, and placed in the aircrew member’s medical
          record. Non-duty station flight surgeons will forward the form to the aircrew
          member’s home station aerospace medicine clinic to be placed in their medical
          record. Flight surgeons will discuss any concerns about an aircrew member’s use of
          No-Go Pills with the individual’s commander if there is any question of misuse. (T-1)
          3.9.6.6.8. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will
          follow PRP notification procedures if prescribed No-Go Pills. (T-1)
3.10. Crew Rest/En route Ground Time. OG/CCs shall establish procedures to place crew
members in crew rest. MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive any portion of the crew rest period or
ground time as needed to meet mission tasking. (T-1)
   3.10.1. Home-station Pre-departure Crew Rest. For all missions crewmembers will enter
   crew rest 12 hours prior to reporting time. This 12-hour period is inviolate; no official duties
   may be performed. Infringement of the inviolate crew rest period will require the start of
   another 12 hour inviolate crew rest period. For missions that will keep aircrew members
   away from home station for more than 16 hours, unit commanders will enter primary and
   MEP aircrew members into pre-departure crew rest 24 hours before they are legal for alert
   time. Aircrew members may perform limited non-flying duties (mission planning,
   launch/recovery) during the first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may waive
   any portion of the first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest. Do not manifest MEP aircrew
   members as passengers to deny pre-departure crew rest. (T-1)          EXCEPTION: AFRC,
   ANG, and AETC in accordance with AFI 11-202V3 and appropriate supplement.
   3.10.2. Off-station/En route Crew Rest. The minimum en route crew rest period is 12 hours
   before legal for alert or scheduled report time when self-alerting.
      3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/A3/DO, C2 agents
      shall not disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When necessary to interrupt aircrew
      members’ crew rest period, re-enter that aircrew in a subsequent minimum 12 hour crew
      rest period after they complete official duties. (T-1)
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                    27


     3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-
     flight duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, storing medical
     equipment/kits, update C2 on patient/mission status, aircrew arming, or mission
     debriefing. (T-1)
  3.10.3. Off-station/En route Ground Time. Mobility planners shall provide aircrews at least
  17 hours ground time between engine shutdown and subsequent takeoff. (T-1)
     3.10.3.1. Mission planners, PICs, MCD, or C2 agents may modify ground time as
     follows:
         3.10.3.1.1. In the interest of safety.
         3.10.3.1.2. To start (mission reporting time) no earlier than 12 hours from the time
         the aircrew entered crew rest. Before reducing ground time, PICs will consider time
         to complete mission planning, cargo up-/off-load, and non-standard mission related
         duties. C2 agents will not ask PICs/MCD to accept less than 17 hours ground time.
     3.10.3.2. Mobility planners should construct mission itineraries with en route ground
     times longer than 17 hours to afford aircrew members opportunities to recover from the
     cumulative effects of fatigue caused by flying on several consecutive days or due to
     transiting several time zones. If practical, make the en route ground time 36 hours
     (maximum) after three consecutive near maximum FDPs.
  3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-of-
  flight delay but provides PICs/MCDs a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert
  and report period outside normal duty time. CECR periods should be of minimum duration
  and are normally used during de-positioning legs. Tasking authorities shall approve
  PIC/MCD requests to delay alert time to normalize the work-rest cycle or increase messing
  options when mission allows. When requests are disapproved, the C2 agent will inform the
  PIC/MCD of the reason for disapproval.
  3.10.5. Post Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning to
  home base sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to
  personal needs. PMCR begins upon return to home base. (N/A AFRC, ANG, and AETC).
  (T-3)
     3.10.5.1. For missions that keep an aircrew off station 16 or more hours, the SQ/CC shall
     provide 1 hour (up to 96 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter aircrew
     members in pre-departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires. (T-3)
     3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and MAJCOM/A3/DO may
     suspend PMCR during contingency operations.
     3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
  3.10.6. Not Used.
  3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved crew rest
  criteria in the Exercise or Contingency Operation Order (OPORD), Operation Plan (OPLAN)
  or Concept of Operations (CONOPs). (T-1)
  3.10.8. Air Crew billeting. Prime Knight is designed to minimize the time aircrews spend
  getting into billeting at crew rest locations. Billeting success depends on the accuracy of the
 28                                                          AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


   aircrew information. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring billeting requirements are
   passed rest with the PIC; however, the C2 agency will assist the PIC as much as possible.
   The following guidance applies to all aircrews and C2 agencies:
       3.10.8.1. C2 agency Notification Responsibilities. MAJCOM C2 will ensure current
       aircrew orders are transmitted to the next crew rest station's C2 agency NLT 30 minutes
       after the mission departs. (T-1)
       3.10.8.2. Aircrew Responsibilities. If a mission is departing from a non-AMC facility,
       the aircrew will call the next crew rest station, when able, to pass crew count/make-up,
       expected arrival time, number of officers, number of enlisted, male and female, etc. (T-1)
       3.10.8.3. SQ/CC or designated authenticating official shall ensure TDY/Flight orders
       clearly indicate the unit fund cite so that the PIC/MCD may make Prime Knight
       reservations in advance. Without a unit fund cite on the TDY/Flight orders, the
       PIC/MCD must make advance reservations using a government travel card to participate
       in the Prime Knight program.(T-3)
       3.10.8.4. AE units will fax a copy of the AEC’s AF Form 4327a, Crew Flight
       (FA)Authorization to local C2 agency where the AE mission is staging from, or will
       RON, and 618 AOC (TACC) (as applicable) NLT 24 hours prior to scheduled mission
       date. This fax copy will notify C2 agencies of mission dates, AE POC (MCD) and assist
       with billeting arrangements. At a minimum, include the following: (T-1)
          3.10.8.4.1. Where the AE mission is staging from and/or RON locations.
          3.10.8.4.2. Identify the MCD.
          3.10.8.4.3. Mission number.
          3.10.8.4.4. Mission date(s).
          3.10.8.4.5. AE Crew names/ranks/gender.
       3.10.8.5. The local C2 agency will provide PIC/MCD AE mission information when
       he/she checks on mission status. The Local C2 agency will be the link between the AE
       crews and the PIC, thus permitting mission status updates to both parties without
       interruption of crew rest.(T-1)
       3.10.8.6. The MCD will interface with local C2 agencies for all AE missions. The MCD
       will ensure:
          3.10.8.6.1. Orders have been received.
          3.10.8.6.2. C2 agencies have MCD’s contact information.
          3.10.8.6.3. Any mission irregularities are discussed. This will occur prior to crew
          rest, at en route mission stops, and at AE mission termination.
       3.10.8.7. In coordination with MCD, the PIC may modify normal ground time (with
       concurrence of controlling agency):
          3.10.8.7.1. In the interest of safety.
3.11. Alerting Procedures. MAJCOM C2 agents shall establish a legal for alert time with the
PIC and when appropriate, the MCD of AE crews. C2 agents will inform PICs and MCDs of
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                   29


aircraft status, expected patient up load time, and other pertinent mission details that will
streamline mission launch. (T-1)
   3.11.1. Crew alerts will be per applicable MDS. Alert times usually allow 1 hour for
   reporting and an adequate number of hours for mission preparation. Refer to Table 3.3
   EXCEPTION: Crew alerts for local training sorties will be per applicable AFI 11-2MDS V3
   and local operating procedures. OG/CCs may establish self-alert procedures for local training
   missions. (T-1)

Table 3.3. AE Crew Alert Times.
Aircraft     Alert
             Time
C-21         3 + 00
C-130        3 +15
C-17         3 + 45
C-5          4 +15
KC-135       4 +15
KC-10        4 +15
       3.11.1.1. For AMC missions, AMC C2 agency will alert the PIC/MCD. The MCD will
       alert the medical crew. The goal is to link the primary PIC, local AMC C2 agency and the
       MCD before mission execution. (T-1)
       3.11.1.2. When the AE crew is staged separate from the front-end crew, the MCD will
       contact AMC local C2 agency and establish alert, showtime, etc. with the C2 agency. The
       MCD will make every effort to communicate with the front-end crew any mission
       irregularities prior to crew rest. Utilize local AMC C2 agency to leave messages for non-
       emergencies. Crew rest will be based on scheduled launch time. Do not violate crew rest.
       (T-1)
       3.11.1.3. AE mission requirements can change depending on clinical status of the
       patient(s) and aircraft availability. There will be occasions when aircraft cannot depart
       (i.e. maintenance problems) or emergency patient movement that may separate an AE
       crew from the front-end crew. The MCD is responsible for communicating these changes
       with the PIC and AMC C2 agency to de-conflict problems.
       3.11.1.4. C2 agents shall not alert outbound crews when inbound aircraft is on A-2 or A-
       3 status until maintenance technicians determine required parts are available and the
       aircraft will be repaired within the target ground time.
       3.11.1.5. Self-Alerts. Crews will self-alert at locations without a C2 agency, but must
       coordinate with controlling C2 agency. The PIC may elect to self-alert on operational
       missions at locations with a C2 agency. Coordinate the alert time with local C2 agents to
       avoid FDP limitations that result from unexpected changes in the mission. (T-1)
   3.11.2. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
       3.11.2.1. On the aircrew’s initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2
       agent, or PIC during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time.
 30                                                           AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


       3.11.2.2. For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected
       alert time. The PIC may extend that window to 8 hours when flying as primary crew or
       12 hours when traveling in MEP status. The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to
       accept more than the 6 hour window. ANG/AFRC aircrew members may extend the
       window as necessary to MEP to home station to meet the Firm Scheduled Return Time
       (FSRT). (T-1)
       3.11.2.3. When a C2 agent determines circumstances will not allow for aircrew alerting
       during the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time,
       he/she will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12 hours from
       the time of notification. (T-1)
       3.11.2.4. At the end of the legal for alert window or if the mission risk becomes elevated
       and the aircraft commander determines the overall risk of the mission prohibits safe
       continuation, he/she will contact a C2 agent and establish a new expected alert time. (T-
       1)
3.12. Stage Management.
   3.12.1. Stage Posture. Stages operate on a positive launch principle. C2 agents shall alert
   aircrews using the following priority/hierarchy: (T-1)
       3.12.1.1. Aircrews that require an emergency return to home station.
       3.12.1.2. De-positioning stage crews will be prioritized by their SRTs.
       3.12.1.3. Aircrews in sequence of arrival time.
       3.12.1.4. If the stage manager returns an aircrew in the stage to crew rest because of a
       mission delay or abort, that aircrew becomes first out when legal for alert.
3.13. Standby Force Duty. MAJCOM C2 Agents shall task units for Standby Force Duty not
later than 18 hours prior to Legal for Alert time. This allows crewmembers 6 hours for pre-flight
duty and 12 hours of pre-standby crew rest. When aircrews are unable to complete all preflight
duties within 6 hours of crew show time, provide an additional 12-hour pre-standby crew rest. If
MAJCOM C2 agents are unable to provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall place the
pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest. SQ/CC may keep an aircrew in ALPHA and BRAVO
status up to 48 hours. MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend this period for contingencies. After 48
hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12 hour pre-departure crew rest. ALPHA/BRAVO
Standby Force status is inviolate; no official duties may be tasked. Infringement of the inviolate
standby force status will require the start of another 12 hour inviolate crew rest period. OG/CCs
may provide additional local procedures for management of Standby Force Duties. (T-1)
   3.13.1. ALPHA Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircrew as an ALPHA
   Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour. Once SQ/CC forms an ALPHA Standby Force,
   that aircrew will accomplish follow-on pre-flights required by technical manuals. Follow-on
   pre-flights done during normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP
   when C2 agent directs the aircrew to launch from crew rest or while performing pre-flight
   (begin CDT/FDP when the aircrew arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-flight). (T-1)
   3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircrew in BRAVO
   Standby Force to permit launch within 3 hours. EXCEPTION: C-21 aircraft launch in 2
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                     31


   hours. Follow-on pre-flights, if required, interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when aircrew
   shows for duty. (T-1)
   3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a
   CHARLIE Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be
   legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE
   status up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, release aircrews from CHARLIE Standby or enter them
   into 12 hours crew rest for directed mission, training mission, or subsequent Standby Force
   duty. (T-1)
   3.13.4. Wing Standby Force. OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status. After a 12
   hour pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be able
   to launch within 3+15 hours. After 12 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrews in 12 hour
   crew rest period before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty.(T-3)
   3.13.5. Post-Standby Missions. On completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be
   dispatched on a mission. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start
   of pre-departure crew rest. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the
   post-mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time. (T-1)
   3.13.6. Post Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following
   standby duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows: (T-1)
       3.13.6.1. If standby duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is
       computed from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
       3.13.6.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is
       authorized.
3.14. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. Refer to DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation
Eligibility, AFI 11-401, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
3.15. Interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs or equivalent to permit the
exchange or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft between mobility units to
accomplish flying missions. Interfly will be limited to specific operations, exercises, or special
circumstances. However, it may be used for events of longer duration such as unit conversion to
another MDS. AFRC/A3 has delegated interfly approval authority to unit OG/CCs for active
duty/ANG interfly with AFRC and AFRC to AFRC interfly. Units utilizing this authority will
inform AFRC/A3V. NGB/A3 has delegated approval authority to Wing Commanders for active
duty/AFRC interfly with ANG, and OG/CC approval authority for ANG to ANG interfly. ANG
units will ensure appropriate active duty General Officer support staff has notified the Air Force
Directorate of Personnel General Officer Management Office (AF/DPG) prior to any active duty
General Officer flying with their unit. Participating aircrews shall use guidelines established by
the lead command or as specified in the OPLAN or CONOPS. EXCEPTION: AE
crewmembers are exempt from interfly requirements. Conduct interfly operations as follows:
(T-1)
   3.15.1. Aircrew members shall be current and qualified in the MDS, as well as unique
   systems or configuration required to fly the aircraft/mission.
   3.15.2. Aircrew members will follow operational procedures established by the lead
   command. The Mission Commander or PIC will brief MAJCOM-specific items.

   3.15.3. Each effected group commander who commits resources (personnel or aircraft) must
   concur with interfly proposal.
   3.15.4. Not Used.
3.16. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP). Procedures and policies regarding MEP are
contained in AFI 11-401. PICs will ensure personnel traveling in this status are properly
authorized. Crewmembers qualified in mobility aircraft are authorized MEP status on any
mobility aircraft to pre/de-position in support of mobility operations. MAJCOM designated
crewmembers who are assigned or authorized to accompany the normal crew complement are
allowed MEP status. (T-1)
   3.16.1. Crewmembers in MEP status are not authorized to:
       3.16.1.1. Displace manifested passengers.
       3.16.1.2. Maintain currency and/or log flying time.
       3.16.1.3. Use for transportation while on leave. EXCEPTION: ANG/AFRC Air
       Technicians may be in a civilian leave status while traveling en route to perform in a
       military duty status.
       3.16.1.4. Travel on Special Air Missions/Command Support Mission (SAM/CSM)
       aircraft unless authorized by HQ AF/CVAM through the PIC.
       3.16.1.5. Travel on Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) when specifically
       restricted by the mission directive (AF Form 59).
       3.16.1.6. Travel on Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft unless authorized by Joint
       Operational Support Airlift Command (JOSAC) through the PIC.
   3.16.2. All MEP require valid travel/flight orders or supporting message authorizing MEP
   status. OG/CCs may authorize MEP status for their mobility aircrews.
   3.16.3. Flight evaluators have priority and will not be displaced by any other MEP. The
   priority for evaluators is MAJCOM, NAF, group, and then squadron level. (T-1)
   3.16.4. MEP normally travel in the crew compartment. If the number of ACMs desiring
   travel exceeds the capacity of the crew compartment, the C2 agency will notify the ATOC,
   who in turn will coordinate with the passenger terminal; seats not previously assigned may be
   used for MEPs.
   3.16.5. The PIC or designated representative will brief MEPs on seat assignment,
   appropriate mission information, emergency procedures including egress, and armed
   crewmembers. The PIC may assign an MEP aircrew related duties for which the MEP is
   qualified.
   3.16.6. ACMs will coordinate their travel with the appropriate C2 agency prior to travel.
   They will process through the C2 agency as early as possible but NLT 3 hours prior to
   planned block time.
3.17. Mission Mobility Observers (MMO). MAJCOM supplements or additional directives
may establish programs authorizing senior military and civilian personnel to fly for mobility
mission familiarization. For AMC MMO information reference AMCI 11-208.
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                       33


3.18. Not Used.
3.19. Flight Attendants on Distinguished Visitor Missions. Flight attendants may fly as
primary crewmembers on designated C-17 missions. They fall under the authority of the PIC, or
MC (if assigned), throughout the mission. An egress briefing will be given to the flight
attendants prior to the first mission leg.
3.20. Policies Governing Attendants.
   3.20.1. If an attendant is determined to be unacceptable, the MCD contacts the C2 agency
   for resolution.
   3.20.2. Medical Attendants (MA) provide patient care, report changes in patient status to
   MCD/FN, provide documentation, and support under the direction and supervision of the
   MCD.
   3.20.3. MAs and Non-Medical Attendant (NMAs) accompany patients from point of origin
   to point of destination MTF. AECMs should offer relief to MAs/NMAs when mission
   requirements allow. NOTE: AE system is not responsible for returning attendants to their
   originating location.
   3.20.4. A CCATT/specialty team (duty positions FZ) will fly with an AE crew. CCATT
   members are classified as Operational Support Flyers (Aviation Service Code 9C) and will
   only fly missions with an assigned AE crew. CCATT personnel coordinate with AECM’s to
   provide patient care and will notify the MCD for any changes in patient status. (T-1)
   3.20.5. Attendants (except flight surgeons, CCATT) do not log any type of flight time.
   3.20.6. Guards of Prisoner Patients:
       3.20.6.1. Accompanies assigned prisoner-patients to their destination facility.
       3.20.6.2. Turns in weapons and ammunition to the PIC/Loadmaster (LM)/Boom
       Operator (BO), as required by appropriate AFI 11-2MDS V3 instructions.
       3.20.6.3. Coordinates with the MCD when handcuffs (if applicable) may be removed
       from the prisoner-patient while the aircraft is airborne.
       3.20.6.4. Prohibited from handcuffing prisoner patients to any portion of the aircraft.
   3.20.7. Enemy Prisoners of War (EPW). When/if EPWs are moved through the AE system,
   originating medical facilities will coordinate/arrange for appropriate host support agencies to
   provide guards for prisoners on AE missions. The AE system does not have the capability to
   provide guards, and prisoners will not be accepted into the AE system without guards.
   Guards assigned to medical prisoners must accompany them to the destination facility.
   AECMs will not accept custody of prisoners. The AE system is not responsible for returning
   guards to the originating location. (T-1)
   3.20.8. Detainee Transport. Detainee missions fall under the responsibility of Security
   Forces and are politically sensitive. Providing AE medical support for detainee missions will
   not normally be practiced unless detainees require in-flight medical care. AECMs will follow
   Security Force guidelines if supporting a detainee mission. (T-1)

                  AIRCRAFT MEDICAL EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS

4.1. Objective.
   4.1.1. Some medical equipment is incompatible with the airborne environment. AE approved
   medical equipment is identified in AFI 10-2909, and the Aeromedical Evacuation Medical
   Equipment        Compendium         and       User’s        Manual       located      at:
   https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a3v/publications.aspx.
   4.1.2. All medical equipment will be tested, deemed airworthy and approved for use through
   HQ AMC/A3VM. A specific test protocol establishing test and evaluation methods is
   developed for each piece of equipment. Tests include altitude/rapid decompression,
   vibration, electromagnetic interference and in-flight performance. In addition, explosive
   vapor testing has been added to all applicable equipment to ensure safety of operation in Fuel
   Vapor Bearing Area (FVBA) i.e. KC-135 aircraft. All applicable equipment listed in AFI 10-
   2909, has passed explosive vapor testing. WARNING: The Airdyne 3500 Air Compressor®
   is not approved for use on the KC-135. (T-1)
   4.1.3. Medical equipment and supplies are vital to the AE mission. There are many hazards
   associated with the changing in-flight environmental conditions that are not encountered in
   fixed facilities. Equipment used onboard AE aircraft must continue to operate properly under
   flight conditions. It is essential AECMs know the capability and performance limitations of
   each specific equipment item.
   4.1.4. HQ AMC/A3VM ensures standardization for equipment used system wide to enhance
   AECM equipment training, and provide for better equipment management.
       4.1.4.1. Newly fielded AE medical equipment will be implemented for use upon delivery
       from HQ AMC/SGXM and receipt of the initial capabilities document and HQ
       AMC/A3TM generated training plan. Upon receipt of all three items, AD and deployed
       units have 90 days to implement use of the equipment, AFRC and NGB using will have
       180 days.
4.2. Not Used.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. HQ AMC/A3VM is the waiver authority for non-certified/non-standard
medical equipment required for patient moves. Waiver requests will be routed as follows:
hospital/MTF will notify appropriate Patient Movement Requirements Center (PMRC). The
validating flight surgeon makes the medical recommendation for use of non-certified equipment.
PMRC will contact appropriate Command and Control (C2) agency, C2 agency will contact 618
AOC (TACC) AE Cell, and AE Cell will contact A3VM. A3VM will consult with the Air
Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC)/Aeromedical Test Laboratory during their
hours of operation. Further consultation on clinical impact will occur with the TPMRC-A/
TPRMC FS. Approval/disapproval is sent back to the AE C2 through the 618 AOC (TACC)
AE Cell. The AE C2 then makes the following notifications: PMRC, AEC and CCATT, as
applicable flying the mission and supporting ground medical elements. The attending physician
must be advised of the known operational limitations of the equipment and the possible effect
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                      35


this equipment may have on the patient’s status in-flight. PMRC will input waiver information
into the USTRANSCOM Regulating and Command and Control Evaluation system (TRAC2ES).
   4.3.1. Waiver will be obtained prior to use of non-certified/non-standard equipment onboard
   the aircraft and applies only to that specific mission. In order to prevent mission delays
   verbal waivers from A3VM are authorized.
   4.3.2. For non-certified/non-standard medical equipment required for patient moves, the
   mission MCD/CCATT will complete DD Form 2852, AE Event/Near Miss Report IAW AFI
   41-307, Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Considerations and Standards of Care. (T-1)
       4.3.2.1. The MCD must inform the flight crew when waived medical equipment is used
       and any characteristics that may affect aircraft systems. (T-1)
   4.3.3. Long-term (permanent) waivers to carry non-certified equipment must be initiated by
   618 AOC (TACC) AE Cell with coordination between HQ AMC/A3. HQ AMC/A3 is the
   approval authority for long-term waivers. (T-1)
   4.3.4. Training Missions. OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority. (T-3)
4.4. Not Used.
4.5. Not Used.
4.6. Not Used.
4.7. Not Used.
4.8. Not Used.
4.9. Not Used.
4.10. Use of Medical Equipment Onboard Aeromedical Evacuation Aircraft.
   4.10.1. Patient Movement Clinical Coordinators (PMCCs) and AECMs must ensure that
   equipment brought to the aircraft from originating hospitals is airworthiness approved for in-
   flight use. (T-1)
4.11. Special Considerations:
   4.11.1. Certain items, such as anti-shock trousers, will require special precautions when
   taken to altitude. Altitude restrictions may possibly be imposed or patient transfer delayed.
   The Validating FS will be consulted when such items are required. The Validating FS will
   advise on any special nursing care requirements and the best method to affect the transfer.
   4.11.2. All air filled balloon devices (e.g. ET tubes, foleys, etc.) will usually be filled with
   normal saline by the originating MTF to avoid the repeated pressure exposure by
   expansion/contraction of the balloons during changes in altitude. AECMs will check to
   ensure this precaution has been accomplished to prevent soft tissue damage and/or irritation.
   The C2 agency will also coordinate with the MTF. NOTE: The CCATT physician may elect
   to fill endotracheal and tracheostomy tube cuffs with air and then attach to a cuff pressure
   monitor to minimize tissue trauma and complications of re-intubation.
   4.11.3. Water seal drainage systems, which use fluid to establish suction, will be checked
   frequently to ensure evaporation/changes in pressure does not reduce suction. (T-1)

pressured to fly when not properly rested. A crewmember who is fatigued shall immediately
notify the MCD, if unable to start or complete a mission safely. Declaring “Safety of Flight”
may be required in this situation.
5.33. Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP). The Military Aviation Safety Action Program
is an anonymous, self-reporting system modeled after successful Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA)/Airline programs to encourage the voluntary reporting Operational issues
and events. It is designed to provide a non-punitive environment for the open reporting of safety
concerns and information that might be critical to identifying hazardous situations and precursors
to accidents. These safety concerns may be either observed or experienced by the submitter.

          servicing is authorized for the C-21. However, the decision to refuel with patients on
          board must be made judiciously and only after the PIC briefs the MCD and the
          patient, on the emergency evacuation plan prior to commencing refueling operations.
          Concurrent servicing is only authorized under the following conditions:
          6.25.5.1.2. If deplaning a critical patient would increase risk by an additional move
          off and back on the aircraft, or
          6.25.5.1.3. If there is no suitable location on the airfield to house the patient during
          the refueling, or
          6.25.5.1.4. If no suitable transportation (ambulance) is available to move the patient
          from the aircraft, or
          6.25.5.1.5. If the patient would be exposed to inclement weather.
          6.25.5.1.6. The aircraft door will remain open during all phases of the refueling
          operation with patients onboard. External power may be applied and cockpit
          aeromedical switches may be placed to the ON position prior to the start of refueling

                6.27.1.1.1.2.2. If the red knob separates, grasp the lanyard to pull the metal
                tab off the cylinder and then proceed to use the EPOS as directed.
                6.27.1.1.1.2.3. Failure to activate the flow of oxygen will reduce the level of
                oxygen inside the hood and will result in suffocation and death.
        6.27.1.1.2. PBE, if available, is excellent for use in smoke, fume, or fire
        environments. They need not be limited to escape only conditions; these devices can
        be used as an oxygen source in a rapid or slow decompression.
     6.27.1.2. Do not remove the loadmaster's emergency equipment (cargo compartment
     quick dons/smoke masks) for use by crewmembers.
     6.27.1.3. Rafts. On overwater flights do not carry more passengers and crewmembers
     than life rafts will accommodate.
     6.27.1.4. Life preserver units (LPU) or Personal Floatation Device. The loadmaster will
     place an LPU within easy reach of each passenger/patient and aircrew member before
     takeoff on overwater flights (outside gliding distance to land). AECMs will assist with
     distribution of LPUs to patients. Crewmembers will fit and adjust LPUs (if applicable)
     for overwater flights and will wear them on overwater missions below 2,000 feet.
     EXCEPTION: LPUs need not be worn for takeoffs, landings, or approaches. Ensure the
     appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard for overwater missions carrying
     children and infants. . Use the Adult/ Child life preserver for litter patients. The use of
     the LPU-6/P Infant Cot is limited to infants 18 months of age or less and up to 30 lbs.
  6.27.2. Mission Emergency Equipment
     6.27.2.1. Aircrew members will comply with the oxygen requirements in AFI 11-202V3.
54                                                          AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


     6.27.2.2. Crewmembers occupying a crew station will have an oxygen mask connected
     and readily available for use from before engine start until engine shutdown.
     6.27.2.3. The MA-1 portable walk-around bottle is the primary emergency oxygen
     source for AECMs. EXCEPTION: If the MA-1 portable walk around bottle is not
     available due to inventory shortage, the Emergency Escape Breathing Devices
     (EEBD)/Protective Breathing Equipment (PBE), may be used as a primary oxygen source
     while performing crew duties.
        6.27.2.3.1. The A-21 regulators of some MA-1 bottles are modified to restrict flow of
        oxygen during servicing. The modification is designed to reduce risk of fire when
        servicing bottles off aircraft. Restricted flow increases on-aircraft fill time from 30-
        45 seconds (unmodified regulator) to as much as 3.5 minutes (modified regulator).
        Under certain conditions, bottles are depleted faster than they can be refilled.
        6.27.2.3.2. Identification. Regulator type is determined by viewing the inside of the
        fill nozzle. Unmodified regulators have a push valve inside the nozzle resembling a
        standard tire valve stem. Modified regulators have a brass plate/filter covering inside
        of nozzle. Modified 2 regulators have a brass plate/filter covering inside of the
        nozzle and no valve stem is visible.
        6.27.2.3.3. Basic Operation. Except for fill times, operation of bottles is identical.
           6.27.2.3.3.1. AECMs will check regulator type during pre-flight. Modified,
           modified 2, or unmodified MA-1 bottles may be used. If an AECM is using a
           modified bottle, they must ensure it is full at mission preflight. If emergency
           oxygen is required during flight and the walk-around bottle is depleted, the
           AECM will don an EEBD/PBE as the second source of emergency oxygen. Once
           the PIC has determined it is safe to move about the cabin and AECMs may
           remove emergency oxygen, AECMs will check the patients. After all patients’
           needs are met AECMs will refill their MA-1 bottle. Should emergency oxygen be
           required before the walk-around bottle is refilled, a PBE will be used. If a PBE is
           not available and the Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS) is the only
           available source, the AECM will cease crew duties and be seated until the PIC has
           directed crewmembers to remove emergency oxygen.
           6.27.2.3.3.2. AE units will not service MA-1 portable oxygen bottles. Dash
           21/Alternate Mission Equipment (AME) shops will ensure MA-1 portable oxygen
           bottles are serviceable and properly maintained. NOTE: If a MA-1 bottle is
           accidentally left open or the system is depleted and not recharged within two
           hours, bottles will be purged as follows:
               6.27.2.3.3.2.1. Fill the bottle using oxygen recharger hose until full (300 psi
               [+/- 25 psi]).
               6.27.2.3.3.2.2. Turn MA-1 bottle upside down and turn to ―EMERGENCY
               setting until empty.
               6.27.2.3.3.2.3. Repeat for a total of three times. Crewmembers will check
               their emergency oxygen equipment during the preflight inspection. Oxygen
               equipment will be immediately available at each crew position, individual
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                      55


                  masks will not be disconnected until all patients/attendants have deplaned.
           6.27.2.3.4. MA-1 portable walk-around bottle preflight (PRICE Check).
              6.27.2.3.4.1. P- Pressure: Ensure portable walk-around bottle indicates 300 psi
              +/- 25 psi.
              6.27.2.3.4.2. R- Regulator: Ensure there are no signs of visible damage to the
              regulator gauge, and view inside of the fill nozzle to identify if bottle is modified
              or unmodified.
              6.27.2.3.4.3. I- Inspection: Ensure Quick-don Mask and goggles are properly
              secured and clean. Check for holes, tears, cuts or abrasions. Inspect bottle for
              signs of damage.
              6.27.2.3.4.4. C- Connections: Ensure Quick-don Mask is connected to O2 bottle.
              Adjust harness to expedite donning in emergency. If connected to aircraft
              communication system, confirm communication capability.
              6.27.2.3.4.5. E- Emergency: Don mask with goggles, pull purge valve, rotate
              through all settings (Normal – Emergency). Oxygen should be felt inside
              goggles. Leave purge valve in the OPEN (pulled out) position for flight. Refill
              MA-1 walk-around bottle and verify connection compatibility with the re-charger
              hose.

EXCEPTION: Where smoke or fumes are not present and goggles are not required, push the
pin in the CLOSED (pushed in) position.

NOTE: AECMs will adjust and fit shoulder harness and leg straps to PREVENT inadvertent
swinging of the bottle when used in an emergency situation.

EXCEPTION 1 - The 3AET may disconnect and off load his/her mask if duties require him/her
to depart the flight line.

EXCEPTION 2 - If all patients and attendants have been deplaned and the AECMs are
deplaning at that station; AECMs may remove oxygen masks if the passengers will be supervised
by the flight crew.
       6.27.2.4. AECMs will have an emergency oxygen source within arm's reach for flights
       above 10,000 feet.
6.28. Fleet Service. (T-1) Ensure the required fleet service items are aboard the aircraft early
enough to permit inventory prior to engine start.

6.60. Medical Emergency/Change in Patient Status. (T-1) If ACLS/BLS algorithms are used
in flight the MCD will immediately notify the PIC regarding the gravity and nature of the
situation. The MCD will coordinate with the PIC to establish immediate radio communication
with the Tactical Airlift Control Center/Air Mobility Operations Control Center/Air Operations
Center/Patient Movement Requirements Center (TACC/AMOC/AOC/PMRC) for a physician
and guidance for landing at an airfield capable of handling the situation, when indicated.
NOTE: Refer to AFI 41-307 for clinical treatment/management
   6.60.1. Per TACC/AOC guidance, land at the nearest airfield capable of handling the
   situation. In grave circumstances, the MCD may request the PIC declare an in-flight medical
   emergency to expedite landing.
   6.60.2. Notify the supporting TACC/AOC and PMRC regarding changes in patient status,
   mission irregularities, coordination of mission needs, and equipment/transportation
   requirements ASAP.          NOTE: The patient’s personally identifiable information (PII) will
   not be used in radio or cell phone communications; use the patient’s cite number only.
       6.60.2.1. Be ready to communicate age, gender, diagnosis, subjective and objective data,
       including vital signs and pulse oximetry, known allergies, and for women of childbearing
       years, date of last menstrual cycle, if indicated. Also report treatment/interventions, date
       and time (if indicated) and the outcome. Be prepared to request orders, mission
       deviation/divert, etc. to expedite meeting patient and mission requirements.
   6.60.3. Anytime a patient is removed from a flight for clinical evaluation/treatment or there
   is a change in status, notify TACC/ AOC and PMRC, ASAP.
6.61. Apparent Patient Death in Flight. (T-1) When a suspected death occurs in-flight, the
MCD will contact C2 immediately if not in a critical phase of flight. If in a critical phase of
flight, MCD will contact C2 as soon as possible following the critical phase of flight or landing.
If in flight, C2 will direct PIC/MCD where to take the patient. If the next scheduled stop is that
patient’s destination the itinerary will not be interrupted. The body will be off-loaded at that
destination regardless if military or civilian.
   6.61.1. When notified by the MCD that a suspected death has occurred, the PIC should
   immediately provide C2 agencies with the following information: “A suspected death has
   occurred on mission number _____. ETA to _____is _____Z, patient cite number _____.”
   The PIC relays this information to the controlling agency for relay to the appropriate C2
   agencies. NOTE: No PII such as name, SSN, etc. will be transmitted, to preclude premature
   release prior to notification of the next of kin.
   6.61.2. If a physician is not onboard during the flight the C2 agencies will make
   arrangements to have a physician meet the aircraft and pronounce the patient dead.
   6.61.3. If a physician is onboard during the flight, he/she may pronounce death in-flight.
   The MCD will document time of pronouncement in Zulu time and the physician will co-sign
   the DD Form 602 or AF Form 3899.
   6.61.4. AECMs will inventory records, medication, baggage and physical effects prior to
   offloading and document on AF Form 1053, Record of Patients Storing Valuables.

   6.61.5. The MCD will contact the deplaning airfield’s Air Transportation Operations Center
   (ATOC) and request mortuary affairs at military installations or, civilian coroner at civilian
   airfields. Once the aircraft has landed, follow that airfield’s guidelines for death certificate
   and body removal. Once the patient has been pronounced deceased, airlift ceases, unless the
   MCD/PIC contact C2 authorities for unique situations. Do not continue airlift without a
   death certificate.
   6.61.6. Home Station. In the event of patient death in flight or patient death within 24 hours
   of flight, upon mission completion, the AES/CC shall ground the involved AEC and conduct
   an investigation to determine if the AEC followed all aircrew procedures. If necessary,
   appropriate actions will be taken to resolve any digressions (AF Form 8, Certificate of
   Aircrew Qualification, retraining, etc.) prior to returning individual(s) involved to flying
   status. AE unit commander shall notify Operations Group Commander who will notify the
   MAJCOM A3 of incident and actions taken.
   6.61.7. Deployed AECMs. In the event of patient death in flight or patient death within 24
   hours of flight, upon mission completion, the Detachment Commander or Detachment
   Operations Group Commander with operation control of the mission will be notified of the
   incident by the C2 agency. If the AEC is in the mobility system, the AE detachment
   commander where the crew disembarks the aircraft will conduct the investigation to
   determine if the AEC followed all aircrew procedures. In the event AECMs are in MEP
   status, AECMs will return to deployed/staged unit.
6.62. Airlift of Human Remains. (T-1) Remains of deceased personnel will not normally be
carried on AE missions. However, in the interest of timely movement or other factors, which
cannot otherwise be satisfied by subsequent airlift, transportation of remains may be authorized.
For 618 AOC (TACC) controlled missions, submit requests for movement of remains on
aeromedical aircraft to the 618 TACC/APCC. The 618 TACC/XOZ, will provide approval.
Approval authority will not be delegated below the 618 TACC/XOZ level. For Non-
USTRANSCOM controlled mission’s contact appropriate C2 agency. If approval is granted to
move remains on aeromedical mission, the ATOC chief will ensure loading or offloading is
accomplished discreetly; not concurrently with passenger and patient loading or offloading. In
such cases, the PIC will ensure the on-load, position, and off-load are conducted in a discrete
manner. In most situations, a ceremony will be conducted to pay respect and honor to the
deceased member.
6.63. Patients Requesting Release from AE System. (T-1)
   6.63.1. The MCD may release active duty patients/attendants only upon a competent medical
   authority's recommendation and with the concurrence of the active duty member's
   commander.
   6.63.2. The MCD will ensure AF Form 3841, Certificate of Release, is completed when a
   non-active duty patient/attendant requests release from the AE system during a mission. If
   the patient is under the age of 18 years, the patient’s legal guardian must sign the form prior
   to the patient’s release.
       6.63.2.1. Whenever completing this form, ensure proper AE C2 agency is informed
       immediately.
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                    61


     6.63.2.2. Prior to obtaining the signature of the requesting individual, the MCD
     determines if the individual is sufficiently competent to understand the purpose of the AF
     Form 3841. If not, the MCD requests advice from a medical authority or the staff judge
     advocate at the place of requested debarkation, if such personnel are available. In all
     instances, guidance from the C2 agency should be requested.
  6.63.3. Prepare the AF Form 3841 in triplicate. The original will be placed in the patient’s
  medical record; one (1) copy will be attached to the AF Form 3829, (or TRAC2ES
  equivalent) to be filed upon termination of the mission; one (1) copy will be given to the
  individual requesting release from the AE system. Also, complete DD Form 2852.
  6.63.4. When a patient, or their authorized representative, requests release from further
  airlift, the MCD advises the individual requesting release, that the purpose of the AF Form
  3841 is to release the U.S. Government, its’ agents, and employees from all responsibility for
  further aeromedical airlift services arising pursuant to the patient’s movement and any and all
  liability from resulting damages. The MCD also advises the patient, or their authorized
  representative, of any risks which may arise from the patient’s request for release from the
  AE system. These risks are annotated on the AF Form 3841. Patients requesting release from
  the AE system should be advised that signing the AF 3841 does not prohibit the individual
  from receiving future AE services. NOTE: The individual's signature on the AF Form 3841
  indicates release of the AE system from responsibility and liability for the patient requesting
  release from the AE system.
  6.63.5. Refusal to sign the AF Form 3841 is annotated in the patient’s medical record.
  6.63.6. Ensure the patient is aware they may not be reimbursed for travel expenses if their
  orders require AE transportation.

aircraft piracy (hijacking) of aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy
(Hijacking), AFI 31-101, and specific MAJCOM security publications contain additional
guidance. Aircrews will not release information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed
aircrew members or missions to the public.
7.2. Security. Aircraft security at non-United States military installations is the responsibility of
the controlling agency. See applicable AFI 11-2MDSV3 guidance.
7.3. Air Force Installation Security Program. (T-1) The following security procedures will
implement AFI 31-101, requirements for each aircraft:
   7.3.1. The aircraft will be parked in an established restricted area and afforded protection
   IAW AFI 31-101.
   7.3.2. When no permanent or established restricted area parking space is available, establish
   a temporary restricted area consisting of a raised rope barrier, and post with restricted area
   signs. Portable security lighting will be provided during the hours of darkness if sufficient
   permanent lighting is not available. Post security forces IAW AFI 31-101.
   7.3.3. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local
   security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If he or she
   determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate
   security is available.
   7.3.4. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security force
   POC must be identified to the PIC.
   7.3.5. Security support is a continual requirement and is not negated by the presence of
   aircrew or ground crewmembers. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft
   doors are closed and the aircraft taxis.
   7.3.6. Locking and Sealing. Lock or seal the aircraft during a ”remain over night” (RON) on
   non-secure ramps. See paragraph 7.6.1.for procedures on how to seal the aircraft.
7.4. Standby Aircraft Security. (T-1) Ensure aircraft hatches and doors are secured to show
unauthorized entry. The PIC shall notify the C2 agency the aircraft is sealed and provide them
a means to access the aircraft in an emergency. Annotate the forms with the time the aircraft was
sealed. The C2 Senior Controller may grant access to a sealed aircraft, shall document time of
entry and ensure it remains launch capable. The PIC or designated representative must be
present if access to the aircraft is required and will ensure the aircraft is resealed. The aircrew
pre-flight portion will remain valid if performed by one aircrew, sealed, and flown by another
aircrew.          NOTE: WG/CCs should develop local procedures for documentation and
management IAW TO 00-20-1 and MAJCOM Supplement.
7.5. En-Route Security. (T-1) The planning agency must coordinate with the execution
agency to ensure adequate en route security is available. The PIC will receive a threat
assessment and en route security capability evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                        63


prior to home station departure and should request updates from en route C2 as required. If
required, a PHOENIX RAVEN team will be assigned to the mission.
   7.5.1. The Phoenix Raven team will normally consist of two USAF security forces members,
   but may include more depending on security requirements. The team's travel status is
   determined by MAJCOM. The team travels in MEP status and is responsible to the PIC at all
   times. In turn, the PIC is responsible for the team’s welfare (transportation, lodging, etc.).
   Ensure security team members receive a mission briefing, aircraft egress/passenger briefing
   (as appropriate).
   7.5.2. Arrival. On arrival, the PIC will assess the local situation and take the following
   actions as required:
       7.5.2.1. Area patrol. Request area security patrols from local security forces. If local
       authorities request payment for this service, use the Aviation Into-Plane Reimbursement
       (AIR) Card or Standard Form 44.
       7.5.2.2. Aircrew surveillance. During short ground times, direct armed crewmembers to
       remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in
       the aircraft vicinity.
       7.5.2.3. Inadequate Security. If, in the opinion of the PIC, airfield security is inadequate
       and the PIC determines the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the
       FDP limits and crew rest requirements and depart as soon as possible for a base
       considered reliable. Report movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as
       practical. If a departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of
       their ability. In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest
       requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.
       The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft
       protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request security assistance from the
       nearest DoD installation, US Embassy, local military or law enforcement agencies as
       appropriate.
   7.5.3. Entry Control Procedures. Unescorted entry is granted to aircrew members and
   support personnel assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199, Air
   Force Entry Control Card, supported by an Entry Access List (EAL) or aircrew orders.
   Aircrew members and assigned crew chiefs are authorized escort authority.
       7.5.3.1. Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their
       duties under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
       7.5.3.2. Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area.
7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry. (T-1)
   7.6.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed
   to allow ground personnel immediate access. If, in the PIC’s judgment, the aircraft needs to
   be locked and sealed in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
       7.6.1.1. Use available aircraft ground security locking devices.
       7.6.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape
       inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
 64                                                           AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


       7.6.1.3. Close and lock door (1L).
       7.6.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of
       a forced entry.
       7.6.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the Office of Special
       Investigation (OSI), security forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency. Have aircraft
       thoroughly inspected prior to flight.
   7.6.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   During preflight activities, aircrews will inspect accessible areas, to include: aircraft wheel
   wells, center accessory compartment, forward avionics compartment, and Air Refueling
   Operators (ARO) aft accessory compartment for unauthorized packages, personnel, or other
   unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious items to host security forces. Aircrews will
   maintain a heightened security posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.7. Preventive Measures. (T-1) Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures
are taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When an aircraft is operating
away from home station, the PIC will comply with this chapter and AFI 13-207, as
supplemented.
   7.7.1. Preventive measures include the following: The host station passenger processing or
   manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers until
   the PIC is fully satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of qualified passenger
   service representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and
   baggage is accomplished.
       7.7.1.1. The Transportation Security Administration provides the latest guidance on
       passenger screening and carry-on allowances. The latest guidance can be downloaded
       from www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/index.shtm.
           7.7.1.1.1. Aircrew must ensure that thorough screenings are accomplished when
           processing passengers at locations without an AMC Passenger Terminal.
           7.7.1.1.2. Carry-on restrictions apply to all passengers/patients required to process
           through the passenger terminal, or equivalent when at a non-AMC location. Carry-on
           restrictions do not apply to those not required to process through the passenger
           terminal, or equivalent when at a non-AMC locations. This includes:
               7.7.1.1.2.1. Aircrew members listed on the Flight Authorization for that mission.
               7.7.1.1.2.2. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) for that mission.
               7.7.1.1.2.3. OSA/VIPSAM passenger not required to process through the
               Passenger Terminal (primary DV, spouses/party, aides, and security details only).
               7.7.1.1.2.4. Duty passengers on ANG/AFRC mission numbers.
           7.7.1.1.3. Consider baggage contained in areas not readily accessible in flight as
           checked baggage, even if carried to the aircraft by the passengers/patients. This
           includes, but is not limited to baggage restrained in the cargo compartment.
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                       65


          7.7.1.1.4. Brief non-exempt passengers/patients that baggage in these areas is not to
          be accessed in-flight. If any non-exempt passenger/patient attempts to access
          checked baggage in-flight, land the aircraft at the nearest suitable airport (preferably a
          military facility) with appropriate law enforcement personnel. Request assistance in
          removing the passenger(s)/patient(s) and accompanying baggage from the aircraft.
          Comply with all law enforcement direction.
   7.7.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients.
   When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform
   required inspections prior to loading. MCD will be provided a written statement that all
   patients and baggage were anti-hijacked IAW AFI 13-207.
      7.7.2.1. For aeromedical evacuation (AE) missions, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) is
      the final authority for determining what items can be carried by/for AE patients.
   7.7.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the
   movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers
   and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.7.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried
   baggage aboard an aircraft. EXCEPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or
   State Department, RAVEN Team Members, and other individuals specifically authorized to
   carry weapons.
      7.7.4.1. Troops or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an
      aircraft. Ammunition will be turned into the troop commander or PIC, and stored in a
      centralized location for redistribution upon arrival. Troops may carry unloaded weapons
      and ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations.
          7.7.4.1.1. Normally, weapons will remain clear with magazines or clips removed
          until immediately prior to exiting the aircraft. However, when the tactical situation
          dictates (in coordination with the aircrew), weapons may be loaded at the order of the
          troop commander or team leader.
              7.7.4.1.1.1. Weapons are considered loaded if a magazine is installed in the
              weapon. This applies even if the magazine is empty.
      7.7.4.2. Dummy clips that can be easily identified may be loaded for training at the order
      of the team leader in coordination with the aircrew.
      7.7.4.3. RAVENs will only be armed in-flight on specifically designated missions
      identified on the mission “frag” as “RAVEN in-flight arming required”.
   7.7.5. If weapons must be cleared, instruct the individual(s) to:
      7.7.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
      personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging their weapons.
      7.7.5.2. Clear weapons IAW standard safety procedures.            Ensure troop/PIC retains
      ammunition IAW paragraph 7.7.4.1.
7.8. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking. (T-1)
 66                                                           AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


   7.8.1. The Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has exclusive
   responsibility to direct law enforcement activity related to actual or attempted aircraft piracy
   (hijacking) in the United States. See CJCSI 3610.01A, dated 20 Jun 06, and 49 USC 46501
   and 49 USC 44903(e)
   7.8.2. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.8.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or
   weapons of mass destruction, DoD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with all pertinent information. Where possible, the FAA will
   consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.8.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
   7.8.5. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.8.6. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
   7.8.7. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may
   be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the
   hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.8.8. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
   7.8.9. In the case of an aircraft carrying passengers, the primary concern is the safety of the
   passengers.
   7.8.10. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested
   by the pilot in command of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the
   anti-hijacking effort.
7.9. Initial Response. (T-1) When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or
aircraft within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until
such time as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack
a military aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple dissuasion, through deception and
subterfuge, to direct physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
   7.9.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened,
   while the aircraft is on the ground:
       7.9.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the
       aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
       7.9.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is
       vested in the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot
       be established, or when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following
       order:
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                       67


           7.9.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
           7.9.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose AOR the airfield lies.
           7.9.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
           7.9.1.2.4. PIC in compliance with MAJCOM directives.
   7.9.2. A hijacked aircraft carrying weapons of mass destruction will not be allowed to
   takeoff. Refer to DoD 5210.41M, Nuclear Weapon Security Manual, paragraph 9B(3), for
   additional guidance.
7.10. In-Flight Resistance. (T-1) After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on
the resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific
counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the
aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material
onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may consider are:
   7.10.1. Engage the hijacker(s) in conversation in an attempt to calm them and to evaluate
   what course of action might be effective.
   7.10.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
   7.10.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
   7.10.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a
   hostile, country.
   7.10.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
   physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. (T-1) Crews facing a
hijacking threat will transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. If an in-the-clear
transmission is not possible, set transponder to 7500. If unable to set transponder, or if not under
radar control, transmit a radio message indicating transponder change to 7500. Notify ground
agencies by any means available as soon as practical and follow-up with situation reports as
circumstances permit. Covert signals are no longer to be used as per FAA guidance.
7.12. Not Used.
7.13. Arming of Crewmembers. (T-1) When crews are directed to be armed by the mission
execution authority, the PIC will determine which crewmembers will be armed (two
crewmembers will be armed unless directed otherwise). All crew members should know who is
armed. The following procedures apply when arming is directed:
   7.13.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, obtain weapons, ammunition, box,
   lock and key. Crewmembers will be armed according to AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of
   Force by Air Force Personnel and MAJCOM publications. If an armed crew member must
   leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew member using AF
   Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
   7.13.2. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to prevent
   identifying armed crew members. Do not wear weapons off the flight line except to and
   from the C2, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities.
 68                                                               AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


       7.13.2.1. AMC Passenger Terminal Procedures. Armed crewmembers must discreetly
       identify themselves to AMC passenger service personnel upon arrival at security
       checkpoints. One crewmember will present a valid set of crew orders, military
       identification card, and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, authorizing
       the carrying of concealed weapons. Once terminal personnel verify this, they will allow
       the crewmember to vouch for the remaining crewmembers. The entire crew will then
       proceed through the magnetometer without removing objects from their pockets. This
       will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are armed.
   7.13.3. Weapons Storage In-Flight. Crewmembers will be armed before beginning preflight,
   onload or offload duties and until completion of all post-flight duties. When no passengers
   are aboard that require arming, weapons may be stored in the gun box in-flight after a
   satisfactory stowaway check. Crewmembers will rearm before landing. Weapons need not
   be unloaded before placing them in a gun box.
   7.13.4. Weapons Storage on the Ground.
       7.13.4.1. Aircrews will store weapons and ammunition in the most secure facility
       available, normally the base armory.
       7.13.4.2. In the event a secure facility is unavailable:
           7.13.4.2.1. Non-stage aircrews may store weapons and ammunition in the aircraft
           gun box.
           7.13.4.2.2. Stage aircrews should contact C2 for guidance.
   7.13.5. When storing weapons in the gun box:
       7.13.5.1. Weapons should normally not be unloaded.
       7.13.5.2. Inform C2 which crew member has the gun box key.
   7.13.6. Crew members will ensure they are reissued the same weapon until mission
   termination at home station.
   7.13.7. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels if available. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another crew
   member; place the weapon on a flat surface.
7.14. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times.

      AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL,
        NUCLEAR, AND HIGH-YIELD EXPLOSIVE THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)
weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security threats to the global operations
of air mobility forces. This chapter describes the CBRN threat, passive defense measures to
mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight operations in a contaminated
environment.
   10.1.1. It is United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) policy that patients
   personnel, or casualties with known or suspected contamination from chemical, biological, or
   nuclear warfare agents will not be transported within the aeromedical patient movement
   system. Decontamination must be performed prior to transport to prevent the potential
   spread of contamination. In rare cases, transport may be essential to preserve life or continue
   critical missions. If such transport is deemed essential, all efforts must be made to prevent
   the spread of contamination. In these cases, prior approval must be given by the involved
   geographic combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and the Secretary of
   Defense (SECDEF) in consultation with Department of Defense medical authorities.
   10.1.2. Patients with known or suspected or highly contagious disease will not normally be
   transported within the patient movement system. These include infections with any agent
   that may pose a potential threat to national security, require special public health actions,
   and/or have the potential to cause public panic and social disruption. Patients known or
   suspected to be infected with a highly contagious disease should be treated ―in place‖ or
   with minimal transportation to medical authorities. In extreme circumstances there may be a
   requirement to move index cases (approximately two) for evaluation or critical medical care.
   If patient movement is required, prior approval must be given by the involved geographic
   combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and SECDEF in consultation with
   medical authorities.
   10.1.3. AMC will train and equip Aeromedical evacuation crews and stage required
   equipment at key hubs to carry out these limited missions for movement of contaminated and
   contagious patients.
10.2. Understanding the CBRN Threat.
   10.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister,
   choking, and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on
   your side. The ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates
   of chemicals all decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or
   absorb into surfaces. For decontamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5
   percent bleach solution currently appears to be the best and most practical method of
   removing chemical agents that may remain as a contact hazard on glass, and unpainted metal.
   Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is soap and water. NOTE:
   Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed chemical warfare
   agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and vapor hazards.
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                        73


   10.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into
   three areas: bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally
   susceptible to antibiotics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms
   or plants; and viruses (i.e., Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive
   and reproduce. Viruses and toxins do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the
   medical community would be the first to recognize that an upsurge in ―flu-like symptoms‖
   is actually a bio attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV rays, humidity and high/low
   temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life, lasting decades under
   the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help prevent
   infection.
   10.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called ―dirty
   bomb,‖ is the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive
   material without using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and
   distance are the best defenses against radiation exposure.
   10.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat,
   and radiation. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a nuclear detonation can
   damage electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of shielding, distance
   from the blast, and limited time of exposure.
10.3. CBRN Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities
conducted to negate, contain, and manage the effects of CBRN attack. Passive defense measures
include pre, trans, and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRN threat through
contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control.
   10.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive
   defense measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include: in-flight diversion,
   survival launch, and minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, aerospace ground
   equipment (AGE), and material handling equipment (MHE).
       10.3.1.1. In-flight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRN
       attack or has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if
       at all possible. Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the
       controlling OPORD.
       10.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every
       reasonable effort will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances,
       aircrew may launch to survive if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to
       the runway. In practice, this option may only be practical for aircraft that have just
       landed or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If launch is not possible, shut down
       engines and avoid running environmental control systems.                   Close aircraft
       doors/hatches/ramps, don Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal
       protective cover on the base. If time does not permit using base facilities, remain in the
       sealed aircraft for a minimum of one-hour after the attack and/or follow host-base
       guidance.
       10.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly
       contaminated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance
       and the use of protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly
74                                                        AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


     contaminated cargo requires special precautions and must be specifically authorized by
     the senior transportation commander.
  10.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided,
  protection provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRN environment.
  Protection is afforded by individual protective equipment, collective protection, and
  hardening of facilities.
     10.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. Aircrew Chemical Biological, Radiological,
     Nuclear (ACBRN) protective equipment contained in D-Bags is the in-flight protective
     gear for aircrew members. Aircrew CBRN equipment includes Aircrew Eye/Respiratory
     Protection (AERP) mask or Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM), filter blower and
     communication unit for above the shoulder protection. Below the shoulder protection is
     provided by CWU-66/P Coverall or Joint Protective Aircrew Ensemble (JPACE), butyl
     gloves, and cotton inserts. The Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) consists items in the C-
     Bag, including a protective mask (MCU-2A/P or M50 Series), C2 series canister/M50
     series filter (as applicable for each type of mask), an over garment, boots, and gloves.
     The ACBRN protective equipment and GCE provide protection against chemical and
     biological agents. They do not provide nuclear blast protection. However they do
     provide limited protection from radiological particulates as well as low level radiation
     from an RDD. Aircrew CBRN equipment requires care during donning using "buddy
     dressing" procedures and Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) expertise during processing
     through the Aircrew Contamination Control Area (ACCA). NOTE: (T-1) AECMs will
     utilize the MCU-2A or M50 series ground crew mask or appropriate JSAM variant mask
     when fielded. Additionally, AECMs will use Individual Protective equipment (IPE)
     AKA Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE)/ Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit
     Technology (JLIIST) suits (with integrated hood) until further guidance is established.
         10.3.2.1.1. ACBRN protective equipment/GCE Issue. Aircrews will be issued sized
         ACBRN protective equipment at home station. GCE issue location is dependent
         upon theater capabilities and reporting instructions. Aircrews will ensure their
         ACBRN protective equipment/GCE and are available at all times when issued for a
         CBRN threat area. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag contents and
         correct sizes.
         10.3.2.1.2. ACBRN protective equipment             Wear During Ground Operations.
         Because aircraft contamination is unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations
         can represent the highest threat to aircrew safety. Protection from enemy attacks and
         exposure to liquid chemical agents is paramount. Aircrew should limit activities to
         essential duties only, and separate ground duties from air duties. (T-1)
     10.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled,
     contamination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE
     such as the ACBRN protective equipment . The basic concept for most facility
     collective protective solutions is to employ overpressure, filtration, and controlled
     entry/exit. The intent is to provide rest and relief accommodations, as well as provide
     medical treatment in contamination free zone. All pressurization systems should be shut
     down and doors sealed if the crew finds itself in need of immediate protection.
     Crewmembers should avail themselves of facilities, if provided, on the airfield. (T-1)
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                       75


      10.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to
      strengthen buildings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To
      reduce the potential of vapor exposure, personnel should consider the use of facilities
      above the first floor.
   10.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control
   measures limit the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through
   disease prevention measures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations.
   Effective contamination control helps sustain air mobility operations by minimizing
   performance degradation, casualties, or loss of material.
      10.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene
      practices, and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive
      measures.
      10.3.3.2. Decontamination.
          10.3.3.2.1. In-flight Decontamination.           Air washing is a useful in-flight
          decontamination technique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal
          surfaces. However, vapor hazards may remain in areas where the airflow
          characteristics prevent complete off-gassing (i.e., wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and
          screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower
          altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes. Fly with the aircraft configured
          (gear, flaps, and slats extended) as long as possible to maximize the airflow in and
          around as many places as possible. Be advised that exterior contamination may seep
          into the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews. Use of ACBRN
          protective equipment is recommended.
          10.3.3.2.2. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and
          equipment may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated
          assets will be restricted to DOD-controlled airfields and not released from US
          government control.
      10.3.3.3. Exchange Zone (EZ) Operations. The AMC Concept for Air Mobility
      Operations in a Chemical and Biological Environment (CB CONOPS) describes a
      method for continuing the vital flow of personnel into a contaminated airfield while
      limiting the number of air mobility aircraft and personnel exposed to the contaminated
      environment. The purpose of the EZ is to minimize the spread of contamination within
      the air mobility fleet, preserving as many aircraft as possible for unrestricted international
      flight. The EZ is an area (located at uncontaminated airfield) set aside to facilitate the
      exchange of uncontaminated (clean) cargo/passengers to a contaminated (dirty) airframe,
      or vice versa, without cross-contamination. Additional information on the EZ is available
      through HQ AMC/A3X.
10.4. Flight Operations. (T-1)
   10.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of CBRN
   weapons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should
   emphasize ACBRN protective equipment wear, crew coordination, CBRN hazards and
   countermeasures, in-flight diversion, plans for onload/offload in the event of a ground attack,
76                                                          AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


  and plans for the return leg in the event of aircraft contamination. Alternative scenario plans
  should also be considered in the event MOPP conditions change.
  10.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control
  channels to ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination's alert
  condition. Diversion of aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless
  operational necessity otherwise dictates. The 618 AOC (TACC) or theater C2 agency
  (normally through the controlling OPORD) will direct aircrew pre-exposure activities such as
  medical pre-treatment for chemical/biological exposure.
  10.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions
  as the result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized.
  Although the aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot,
  thus restricting the aircraft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
  10.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen
  requirements. Aircrew wear of ACBRN protective equipment will require use of the
  aircraft oxygen system to counter actual/suspected contamination. Using the 100 percent
  oxygen setting offers the greatest protection in a contaminated environment. Appropriate
  oxygen reservoir levels must be planned to meet higher consumption rates. Use the aircraft
  Dash 1 charts to calculate the required reservoir levels.
  10.4.5. Donning Equipment.            AECM’s will don Individual Protective Equipment
  (IPE)/Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE)/ Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology
  (JLIST) based on the alarm condition IAW AFMAN 10-100. Use the "buddy dressing"
  procedures, and refer the locally developed donning checklist contained in the D-Bag to
  ensure proper wear When wearing the ACBRN protective equipment , Atropine and 2 PAM
  Chloride auto injectors will be kept in the upper left ACBRN protective equipment pocket.
  If the integrated survival vest/body armor is worn, the Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto
  injectors may be kept in the lower right flight suit pocket. This standardized location will
  enable personnel to locate the medication should an individual be overcome by CWA
  poisoning. M-9 paper on the flight suit will facilitate detection of liquid chemical agents and
  ACCA processing. M-9 paper should be placed on the flight suit prior to entering the CBRN
  threat area or when an alarm ―yellow‖ or higher has been declared. When inbound to a
  CBRN threat area, prior to descent, the aircraft commander will ensure crew and passengers
  don appropriate protective equipment IAW arrival destination's MOPP level and brief
  aircrew operations in the CBRN threat area. As a minimum, this briefing will include: flight
  deck isolation, oxygen requirements, air conditioning system requirements, IPE
  requirements, ground operations, and MOPP levels. Aircrew members must determine if the
  wear of the integrated survival vest/body armor and LPUs will restrict dexterity and mobility
  to the point that it becomes a safety issue. If the aircrew deems the equipment to create a
  safety of flight concern, then the items may be pre-positioned (instead of worn) on the
  aircraft to be readily available to the aircrew.
  10.4.6. Communicating Down-line Support. Pass aircraft and cargo contamination
  information through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be
  used to determine if a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed.
  Report the physical condition of any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and
  whether they are wearing chemical defense ensembles.
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                        77


10.5. Ground Operations. (T-1)
   10.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a
   contaminated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-
   flight crews are not available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to
   entering crew rest. The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-
   flight briefings. If possible, aircrew transport should be provided in a covered vehicle.
   Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to departure to prevent contamination
   spread to them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they will require assistance
   from ground support personnel in removing their aircrew protective overcape and overboots
   prior to entering the aircraft.
   10.5.2. Onload and Offload Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent
   contamination spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the
   flight deck area. Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine
   covers, safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic
   bags. Aircrew members entering the aircraft will remove plastic overboots and overcape
   portions of the aircrew ensemble and ensure flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and
   placed in clean plastic bags. Prior to entering the aircraft all personnel should implement
   boot wash/decontamination procedures. Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated
   environment will don plastic overboots and overcape prior to leaving the aircraft.
   10.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete
   ACBRN protective equipment, complicates communications capability. Use the mini-
   amplifier/speaker or the aircraft public address system and augment with flashlight and hand
   signals, as required.
   10.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from
   a contaminated to an uncontaminated airbase. Critical requirements are pre-designated in
   theater war plans. On-load cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the
   aircraft. If contaminated, protective cover(s) will be removed/replaced just prior to placing
   the cargo on the aircraft. It is the user's responsibility to decontaminate cargo for air
   shipment. The airlift of contaminated or formerly contaminated cargo requires the approval
   of the senior transportation commander.
   10.5.5. Passenger/Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and the
   ground transportation vehicle to reduce interior contamination when loading/unloading
   passengers/patients. Normally, externally contaminated patients and those infected with
   contagious biological agents will not be transported onboard AMC or AMC-procured
   aircraft. The AMC/CC is the waiver authority to this policy. (NOTE: An altitude below
   10,000 feet is recommended due to AECM use of the ground chemical mask.)
   10.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems
   resulting from physical exertion while wearing ACBRN protective equipment . The aircraft
   commander should consider factors such as ground time, temperature and remaining mission
   requirements when determining on/offload capabilities. Individuals involved should be
   closely monitored for adverse physiological effects.
   10.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize
   thermal stress caused by wearing the ACBRN protective equipment. Aircrews must weigh
 78                                                         AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


   all factors when performing in-flight and ground duties. The following are degradation
   factors for wearing full GCE, and may also be used to represent the Task Time Multipliers
   for the ACBRN protective equipment . To estimate how much time it takes to perform a
   task or operation, (1) take the Task Time Multiplier (Table 10.1) for the appropriate Work
   Rate and ambient air temperature and (2) multiply it by the time it normally takes to perform
   the task. For example, given a heavy work rate and an air temperature of 70F, the
   crewmember should expect a normal one hour task to take 2.1 hours while wearing ACBRN
   protective equipment. A more extensive discussion of this subject is found in AFMAN 10-
   2503, Operations in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High Yield
   Explosive (CBRNE) Environment.

Table 10.1. Task Time Multipliers.




   10.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with
   actual/suspected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke
   and Fume Elimination procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close
   inspection of aircrew, passenger ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9
   detection paper. Detection paper only detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor
   hazards. Above the shoulder ACBRN protective equipment should only be removed if
   there is absolutely no vapor hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the
   detectable levels of currently fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed
   space. The aircrew must take every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants,
   especially on the flight deck area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected
   contamination, avoid those areas for the remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo
   compartments cool. If an aircrew member or passenger has been in contact with liquid
   contaminants, all personnel aboard the aircraft will stay in full ACBRN protective equipment
   GCE until processed through their respective contamination control area (CCA). Upon
   arrival, the contaminated aircraft will be parked in an isolated area and cordoned to protect
   unsuspecting ground personnel.
   10.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an
   aerospace vehicle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological,
   biological or chemical contaminant, a Red X will be entered and an annotation will be made
   in historical records for the lifecycle of the equipment.
   10.5.10. 10-Foot Rule. The 10-foot rule was developed in order to provide guidance for
   protecting personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in
   locations with materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 10-foot rule embodies a
   safety factor that goes beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE
   whenever detectors no longer detect a chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases
   associated with the 10-foot rule.
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                        79


     10.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4
     whenever they stay within 10 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few
     seconds. This MOPP level provides personnel the maximum protection from the
     chemical agent as it transitions from a contact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
     10.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves of a sort
     (i.e. leather, rubber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated
     equipment. Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent
     may still be present. The use of gloves will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact
     with agent residue is avoided.
     10.5.10.3. Ten-Foot Rule Time Standards (Source: AFMAN 10-2503). Figure 10.2
     shows times associated with initial and follow-on phases of the 10-foot rule. To simplify
     response processes, commanders may choose to use the worst case scenario as the
     foundation for all 10-foot rule actions, i.e., 24 hours for the initial phase and all periods of
     time greater than 24 hours for the follow-on phase.

   13.1.2. Have advanced training in the operation of specialized medical equipment designed
   and approved for use at altitude.
   13.1.3. Are trained and current in the aircraft systems and configurations required for safe
   AE operations.
   13.1.4. Provide in-flight assistance to medical attendants as situations dictate.
13.2. Mission Planning (T-1)
   13.2.1. Aircraft seats identified in applicable T.O.s or AFI 11-2AE V3 Addenda A as ACM
   seats will not be used for patient passenger seating.
   13.2.2. The MCD may reserve get-down litters as mission needs dictate. For mission legs
   exceeding four hours in length; a minimum of two litters should be set up for ambulatory
   patient use. An emergency litter will be set up on all AE missions. When required/mission
   load permits, a minimum of one seat will be reserved for every three litter patients on all AE
   missions. EXCEPTION: An emergency litter is not required for ambulatory patient
   movement on C-21 missions.
   13.2.3. Patients and/or attendants will not be relocated to litters, in order to make seats
   available for passengers. Regardless of age, all patients and attendants will have their own
   assigned seat and will not be required to give up their seat for passengers. In-lap seating of
   patients and/or attendants to accommodate passengers is prohibited on AE missions.
   13.2.4. For planning purposes, critical care patients should have an entire litter tier to
   accommodate patient care and additional medical equipment. EXCEPTION: During
   contingency/humanitarian missions, maximize the aircraft capability for all litter patients
   13.2.5. A five (5) high configuration using the litter stanchions is approved for all C-130 AE
   missions.
   13.2.6. When cargo requirements permit, the seat and litter stanchion ladder will be installed
   for all C-130 AE missions.
   13.2.7. Ensure adequate space for in-flight treatment of litter patients. The vertical distance
   between each loaded litter will not be less than 21 inches (18 inches on C-130 when loading
   5-high). NOTE: When litter patients are wearing personal gear (i.e. web belts, canteen,
   helmets, flak vests, etc.), consider loading four (4) high versus five (5) high in the center seat
   and litter stanchions, to increase space between litters to accommodate gear. If situation
   requires/permits, remove personal gear from patients and secure on ramp or in a designated
   area.
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                      83


   13.2.8. Available litter spaces and ambulatory seating will depend on the aircraft cabin’s
   mission configuration. (i.e. aircrew flight equipment storage containers and tool box
   stowage).
   13.2.9. Patient/Cargo Mix.
       13.2.9.1. Cargo and passengers may be carried with patients unless a clear detriment to
       the health and well-being of the patient or passengers can be demonstrated. The decision
       will be made by the MCD, considering the need for maximum utilization of the aircraft.
       Conflicts will be referred to the respective tasking AE command element for a final
       decision. NOTE: Cargo will not be bumped except in very unusual/abnormal cases, and
       only after the PIC/MCD contacts 618 AOC (TACC) and appropriate C2 agencies.
       13.2.9.2. When transporting both cargo and litter patients, litters will be transported
       forward of the cargo pallets, if possible. NOTE: Patients may be placed forward of
       cargo on the KC-135. Discretion will be used in considering patient/cargo mix when
       using PSP and SLS configurations. Use appropriate PSP extensions to ensure egress
       route is unobstructed.
       13.2.9.3. If not possible, and the PIC and MCD agree, patients may be transported aft of
       the cargo. The LM/BO must make every effort to stay in the vicinity of the crew and
       patients in-flight, and during critical phases of flight.
13.3. Preflight Duties. (T-1)
   13.3.1. Ground support crew, consisting of at least one qualified AECM, may preflight the
   aircraft for an AE mission. It is the responsibility of the CMT to ensure the aircraft has been
   correctly configured/preflighted before accepting the aircraft for patient transport. A
   qualified AECM from the ground support crew will brief and conduct aircraft walk through
   with the CMT on completed abbreviated checklist items prior to the flight crew assuming
   responsibility.
   13.3.2. Roller conveyors will be removed from all aisle way, walkway, and AE litter patient
   positions.
       13.3.2.1. (C-17) On the ramp, roller conveyors will be stowed unless the baggage pallet
       or LSAS are in position. Before enplaning/deplaning procedures, the LSAS will be
       secured in the Aerial Delivery System (ADS) Rails in position 10. All rollers in position
       11 will be stowed. (C-130) Patient and crew safety will be evaluated prior to
       enplaning/deplaning of patients. If safety concerns exist and time permits, roller
       conveyors will be removed from the ramp. As mission dictates, rollers required to remain
       on the ramp during enplaning and deplaning will be positioned as close to the ramp edge
       as possible.
   13.3.3. If the aircraft is configured with airline seats, the CMT will check the security of all
   patient/passenger seats by lifting upward on the front of the seat frame and gently pushing
   and pulling on the seat backs. Minimal movement is acceptable.
   13.3.4. Oxygen and Electrical. Lines may be run together (parallel) throughout the aircraft
   cabin. Electrical outlets with electrical equipment plugged into them will not have an oxygen
   flow meter within 12 inches of that outlet. Do not secure any oxygen and/or electrical lines
84                                                           AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


  on the floor, across aisles or areas where they will be walked on. EXCEPTION: When
  patients are floor-loaded, oxygen and or electrical lines may be secured on the floor.
     13.3.4.1. Attach/secure oxygen and electrical lines to litter clamps, or secure with hook
     and loop fasteners (Velcro), or on procured/developed equipment securing devices
     located in the in-flight kit. When securing oxygen and/or electrical lines in litter brackets,
     inspect the bracket for visible wear on the rubber pad of the bracket. If the bracket’s
     rubber pad is worn, pad the bracket with available material. Do not use tape. All
     brackets without rubber pads will be annotated on applicable AFTO IMT 781A, for turn-
     in to maintenance for repair or replacement. WARNING: The only acceptable options
     to run oxygen and electrical lines without the concurrence of the LM/BO is to utilize the
     stanchion poles, stanchion straps, C-17 fuselage or PSP securing devices. Crews must
     coordinate with the LM/BO prior to securing oxygen/electrical lines outside of these
     parameters. Lines looped over moving parts jeopardize the safety of the aircraft, medical
     equipment and crew.
     13.3.4.2. AECMs will wear gloves when making electrical connections, during
     configuration and patient loading to prevent personal injury.
     13.3.4.3. Equipment will not be plugged in until after the aircraft electrical system has
     been turned on.
     13.3.4.4. Electrical lines will be positioned/secured and a completed functional check of
     medical equipment performed on the aircraft prior to enplaning patients. EXCEPTION:
     May be modified as situation dictates for operational contingency/combat missions.
     13.3.4.5. Flight gloves will not be worn when handling or connecting oxygen equipment
     devices to an oxygen delivery source. Hands will be clean and free from oils, lotions,
     paints, grease, or similar materials. NOTE: Do not drag the Schrader end on the oxygen
     line across the aircraft floor.
     13.3.4.6. Oxygen lines will be secured prior to enplaning patients. EXCEPTION: For
     operational contingency/combat missions, oxygen lines will be secured prior to take-off.
     13.3.4.7. “Oxygen available” means oxygen can be made quickly available to the
     patients. Positioning of a flow meter, O2 adapter, and unopened mask or nasal cannula
     somewhere in the vicinity of the patient, meets this requirement. NOTE: The AE crew is
     not required to have therapeutic oxygen immediately available for space available
     passengers. A dedicated patient emergency oxygen line connected to a BVM will be set
     up prior to patient on-load and remain connected until all patients have deplaned.
     13.3.4.8. During all operational and ARM AE missions, the MCD will document on the
     AF Form 3829, Summary of Patients Evacuated By Air or on computer generated
     TRAC2ES cover sheet.
        13.3.4.8.1. Total patient oxygen requirement.
        13.3.4.8.2. Total pre-mission PTLOX/NPTLOX/Therapeutic Oxygen Level.
        13.3.4.8.3. Total mid-mission PTLOX/NPTLOX/Therapeutic Oxygen Level.
        13.3.4.8.4. Total post-mission PTLOX/NPTLOX/Therapeutic Oxygen Level.
        13.3.4.8.5. Maximum cabin altitude during mission.
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                   85


      13.3.4.9. On missions with ventilator patients, AECMs will calculate pre-mission oxygen
      requirements using 20 LPM for LTV series ventilators and 15 LPM for all other
      ventilators.
          13.3.4.9.1. Prior to enplaning ventilated CCATT patients, AEC and CCATT
          personnel will verify patient oxygen requirements.
          13.3.4.9.2. For C-17 missions, use aircraft therapeutic oxygen as the primary source
          for ventilated patients. If mission requirements preclude the use of aircraft
          therapeutic oxygen, a dedicated PTLOX/NPTLOX will be used for ventilated
          patients.
          13.3.4.9.3. For KC-135 and C-130 missions, ventilated patients will have a dedicated
          PTLOX/NPTLOX.
          13.3.4.9.4. Calculated oxygen requirements may require the use of additional
          PTLOX/NPTLOX to meet the requirement for a dedicated source. AECMs will not
          use the dedicated PTLOX/NPTLOX for any other patient or emergency equipment.
          A bag-valve-mask can be connected to the dedicated PTLOX/NPTLOX to support
          the ventilated patient.
13.4. Ground Operations. (T-1) The CMT is responsible for all AE ground operations. The
CMT, in coordination with the LM/BO, is responsible for vehicle movement/positioning around
the aircraft. Refer to section 20.3 for vehicle operations.
   13.4.1. At locations where there is AE ground support, the CMT will coordinate
   enplaning/deplaning procedures with the en route casualty care facility and LM/BO prior to
   enplaning/deplaning patients. At locations without AE ground support, the CMT will
   coordinate enplaning/deplaning procedures with the sending/receiving facility and LM/BO.
   NOTE: Medical facility support personnel on the aircraft will be kept at a minimum during
   ground operations prior to enplaning/deplaning. A maximum of 3 personnel from each
   facility can be utilized to brief/receive patient report.
   13.4.2. Patient Preparation for Enplane. NOTE: MCD/CMT will be responsible to ensure
   that all preparation and enplaning tasks are completed prior to patient onload and may
   delegate these tasks as necessary.
      13.4.2.1. The CMT will verify with the FN receiving report that anti-hijacking
      procedures were accomplished prior to enplaning. Perform anti-hijacking procedures if
      not accomplished.
      13.4.2.2. The CMT is responsible to ensure mission expectations are briefed and patients
      are assessed prior to enplaning.
      13.4.2.3. Identify patients requiring assistance. Litter patients may be enplaned/deplaned
      as ambulatory if in the professional judgment of the FN no contraindications exist (e.g.
      doctor’s order for bed rest, inability to climb stairs or walk long distances, etc.).
      13.4.2.4. Distribute hearing protection to all enplaning patients and attendants.
      13.4.2.5. The CMT will ensure litter patients are checked for security to include
      approved litter, strap placement, and proper backrest placement prior to enplaning.
 86                                                          AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


      However, all AECMs will monitor for safe litter strap placement. Ensure all patient
      personal items located on litter are secured prior to patient movement.
      13.4.2.6. Ensure that all ambulatory patient personal belongings, to include medications
      if self-medicating, are in their possession. NOTE: Patients/passengers may be allowed to
      use canes, crutches, or walkers for enplaning at the discretion of the MCD/FN.
      13.4.2.7. Identify patients with non-standard/non-certified medical equipment.
   13.4.3. Patient Preparation for Deplane:
      13.4.3.1. AECM’s will check litter patients for security to include litter strap and
      backrest placement prior to deplaning. AECM’s will ensure all equipment used on the
      patient is disconnected from aircraft systems. All patient medical devices and personal
      items located on the litter will be secured prior to patient movement.
      13.4.3.2. Ensure that all ambulatory patient personal belongings, to include medications
      if self-medicating, hand carried bags, and medical supplies are in their possession.
      NOTE: Patients/passengers may be allowed to use canes, crutches, or walkers for
      deplaning at the discretion of the MCD/FN.
      13.4.3.3. Ensure soiled linen and sharps containers are collected for removal from the
      aircraft.
      13.4.3.4. Ensure all contaminated items are collected, bagged, and labeled for removal
      from the aircraft as specified in AFI 41-307.
13.5. Transfer of Patient Care. (T-1) In the AE system, transfer of patient care occurs
between AE representatives of the MTF, en route casualty care system, or external agencies
to/from the AEC. Transfer of physical care is complete once the patient enters or exits the
ground vehicle of transportation. NOTE: Enplaning/deplaning during patient report is highly
encouraged. Final approval is at the discretion of the MCD.
   13.5.1. Transfer of care will be to a comparable or higher level of care capability. Time will
   be allotted for the ground healthcare provider and AECM to have an opportunity to ask and
   respond to questions as needed. A verbal report will include, but is not limited to:
      13.5.1.1. Patient Identification.
      13.5.1.2. Patient’s present clinical situation such as, diagnosis, date of injury, date of
      surgery, responsiveness, ambulatory status, code status, and if he/she has attendants.
      13.5.1.3. Patient’s recent and significant clinical background such as allergies, if the
      patient self-administers medications, when the last dose of prescribed medications were
      given or taken, and any other pertinent information or history.
      13.5.1.4. Patient’s pertinent assessment information such as vital signs, pain level,
      airway status, breathing, oxygenation, circulatory status, any intravenous solutions or
      blood products, accompanying or attached medical equipment or devices, abnormal labs,
      and any other pertinent information.
      13.5.1.5. Any new or specific clinical orders and instructions or important information
      specific for the patient transport.  NOTE: AE Patient Safety recommends using a
      standard format for patient handoff in the AE system. A recommended tool for patient
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                     87


       handoffs        can        be    found    by      following   this    link:
       https://eis.af.mil/cs/usafae/USAF%20Aeromedical%20Evacuation%20Documents/A
       E%20Patient%20Safety/SBAR%20checklist%20(HQ%20AMC%20approved).pdf
       13.5.1.6. AECM’s will ensure the AF Form 3899, Patient Movement Record series is
       complete and supports transfer of care communications between the AEC and the AE
       representative.     NOTE: Enlisted personnel may only take control of narcotics, or other
       controlled medications if they have been trained and appointed by the MTF commander.
       NOTE: If any patient condition is questionable or exceeds the capabilities of the AEC,
       notify the MCD. The MCD may refuse a patient for AE transport if the patient’s
       behavior is determined to be detrimental to self and others, the patient has not been
       adequately prepared for AE movement, or medical/therapeutic interventions are
       ineffective. Document on AF Forms 3829/3830/3899 or DD Form 602 information
       related to refusal of patient. Notify controlling MAJCOM C2 agent and PMRC at time of
       refusal.
   13.5.2. Medical attendants will accompany patients to the destination medical facility.
       13.5.2.1. FNs must exercise good judgment in determining the need for an AECM to
       accompany patients to the destination medical facility.
   13.5.3. At scheduled RON stations, when a nurse/licensed provider is not available to
   receive report on the flight line, an AECM is responsible for accompanying patients to the
   facility if the patient’s medical condition warrants clinical observation during transport.
   13.5.4. If medical personnel do not meet the aircraft, the MCD will ensure a member of the
   crew accompanies patients to the destination facility and provide a transfer of care handoff to
   an appropriate medical representative. A transfer of care handoff must occur between the
   medical crew and a medical representative taking responsibility for the patient. A DD form
   2852 will be completed and the C2 agency will be notified when the accompanying AECM
   completes his/her duties. NOTE: This will extend CDT.
   13.5.5. All female litter psychiatric patients should be provided with a female attendant
   during movement between the aircraft and the destination facility. If accompanied by a
   responsible adult female, attendant, another non-psychiatric female patient, or military
   sponsor, there is no need for an additional attendant to escort the patient.
13.6. Enplaning/Deplaning Procedures. (T-1) The MCD and CMT have direct and final
authority over all patient enplaning and deplaning activities. AECMs are responsible to oversee
all activities involved with patients in and around the aircraft.
   13.6.1. During enplaning/deplaning of patients, the MCD or designated AECM will control
   operations from the aircraft ramp. Position on the ramp is at the discretion of the AECM.
   NOTE: On the ramp, only wireless headsets are approved during enplaning/deplaning
   operations.
       13.6.1.1. All aircrafts should have engines shut down during enplaning and deplaning of
       patients unless conducting ERO procedures IAW section 13.6.7. Safe, smooth enplaning
       activities depend on the coordinated efforts of the AECMs and the MTF. Consideration
       of climate conditions, ground support capability to include manpower and vehicular
       support, all play a role in safe operations.
88                                                            AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


     13.6.1.2. Keep ambulatory patients grouped together.
     13.6.1.3. Patients will not walk under aircraft wings.
     13.6.1.4. Monitor patient use of aircraft stairs/Patient Loading System (PLS).
     13.6.1.5. Ensure all patients keep one hand free for grasping the handrail. NOTE:
     Attendants may carry infants on and off the aircraft. Infants may be carried in a chest or
     back carrier.
     13.6.1.6. Patients will not be seated in seats that do not lock in the full upright position or
     secure into applicable aircraft track.
  13.6.2. Enplaning/Deplaning Communication:          When multiple litter patients are being
  loaded, hand signals will be used.
     13.6.2.1. The ―THUMBS UP signal indicates to the litter bearers the aircrew is
     prepared for litter enplaning/deplaning. An exaggerated motion, raising the whole arm
     above the head, must be used during ERO procedures.
     13.6.2.2. Extending crossed arms above the head indicates a ―STOP signal to the litter
     bearers to stop all movement.
     13.6.2.3. The ―SLOW DOWN signal indicates to the litter bearers to gradually slow the
     pace until the signal is ceased. The signal is given by extending arms outward and
     raising and lowering the arms from shoulder to waist with palms facing the ground.
     13.6.2.4. AECMs will direct and signal litter bearers to the proper litter tier as they enter
     the aircraft. This is done using exaggerated hand motions.
     13.6.2.5. AECMs will physically reach out and identify the litter arm or litter bracket on
     the stanchion where the litter will be placed. This allows litter bearers to visualize the
     position before they reach the litter tier.
     13.6.2.6. Litter Commands.
         13.6.2.6.1. Litter Loading. The AECM at the forward end of the litter will give the
         command to lift the litter into the litter brackets. The AECM at the forward end of
         the litter will ensure everyone is prepared to lift using the preparatory command
         ―”PREPARE TO LIFT”, if no indication of a negative response, give the execution
         command ―”LIFT”.
         13.6.2.6.2. Litter Unloading. The AECM at the forward end of the litter will give the
         command to lift the litter out of the litter brackets. The AECM at the forward end of
         the litter will ensure everyone is prepared to lift using the preparatory command
         ―”PREPARE TO LIFT”, if no indication of a negative response, give the execution
         command ―”LIFT”.
  13.6.3. General Litter Loading Considerations. Safety is the primary concern during litter
  transfers. Proper lifting techniques should be used at all times. At no time should patient
  safety be compromised. In the event of large litter loads, ensure workload is distributed
  among numerous litter bearers, when available.
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                       89


WARNING: Litters lifted above waist level will first be brought to chest level and then lifted
into place by no less than four-persons.

NOTE: Patients should have minimal exposure to the elements during enplaning/deplaning.
Patients will not be staged/positioned on the aircraft ramp or flight line during inclement
weather. Setting patients on either platform should be avoided.

NOTE: CCATT patients may be positioned with their head towards the flight deck if the
CCATT physician determines patient condition warrants head first placement.
       13.6.3.1. On the C-17/C-130 litter patients will be enplaned feet first and deplaned head
       first due to minimal degree of ramp incline. This eliminates the need to turn litter patients
       around on the cargo ramp prior to placing them in the litter tier. On the KC-135 litter
       patients will be enplaned head first to eliminate the need to turn litter patients around
       once on the aircraft.
       13.6.3.2. When the cargo ramp is unavailable or if cargo is already on the aircraft prior
       to enplaning/deplaning litter patients, litters may be loaded through the paratroop
       doors/crew entrance door.
       13.6.3.3. When enplaning/deplaning litters through the paratroop doors/crew entrance
       door on the C-130, at least four (4) people must be employed on the ground with an
       additional two (2) to three (3) people inside the aircraft.
       13.6.3.4. On the C-17, to load through the paratroop doors or the forward emergency
       escape door, a minimum of six people on the ground to lift over the head and four on the
       aircraft is required.
       13.6.3.5. Position personnel in a way that they can safely hand the litter off to others as
       needed.
       13.6.3.6. When a comfort pallet is in place (C-17) first determine if there is adequate
       clearance to safely enplane/deplane the litter and any medical support equipment.
       WARNING: The preferred method to enplane/deplane ambulatory patients on the KC-
       135/KC-10/C-5 is the air stairs. The air stairs will not be used to enplane/deplane litter
       patients or weighted litters. If there is no other option available, the MCD will contact the
       appropriate C2 agency for A3VM waiver.
       13.6.3.7. Both litter/ambulatory patients will enplane/deplane, using the Patient Loading
       System (PLS) or High Deck Patient Loading Platform (HDPLP). Maximum PLS weight
       capacity is 1500 lbs distributed and is rated to withstand 50 knot winds. Maximum
       HDPLP weight capacity is 8000 lbs distributed, the lift gate capacity is 2600 lbs
       distributed and is rated to withstand 40 knot winds.
       13.6.3.8. If the PLS/HDPLP is not available, request a Hi-lift truck, Halverson Lift,
       Tunner (K-Loader), for patient enplaning/deplaning. Ensure one AECM accompanies the
       patient (s).     WARNING: Ensure all safety precautions are utilized when
       enplaning/deplaning patients on a K-Loader. One AECM should be directing patients
       during enplaning/deplaning. AECM’s should coordinate with BO to utilize ramps to
       cover gap between aircraft and K-Loader to prevent personnel from injury.

     13.6.3.9. Rollers on alternate platforms such as the Tunner will be turned over before
     beginning enplaning/deplaning operations. WARNING: Patients and medical equipment
     will not be placed on the patient support pallet (PSP) during pallet loading or off-loading.
     13.6.3.10. Litter stanchion arms on the C-17 and PSP are designed for non-sequential
     loading.
     13.6.3.11. AECMs will always secure the outside litter bracket immediately after loading
     a litter into a litter position. The inside bracket can be secured if time permits but will be
     secured prior to take-off.
     13.6.3.12. When only one (1) patient occupies a litter tier, the patient will be placed at a
     level that optimizes medical care, and allows the patient to easily get on and off the litter.
     13.6.3.13. When a litter, occupied or unoccupied, is placed in the lowest litter tier, a litter
     must be secured at waist level above it to prevent a tripping hazard. CAUTION:
     AECMs will be mindful of the potential strike hazard unoccupied litter stanchion arms
     (C-17 or Patient Support Pallet) present. To help eliminate the hazard: remove litter
     stanchion arms and store in a secure location on the aircraft. If a secure location is not
     available, place an empty litter in a vacant position or cover empty litter stanchion arms
     with blankets and secure with litter straps.
  13.6.4. C-130 aircraft litter loading procedures.
     13.6.4.1. It is the MCD/CMT discretion either to use a four or two person carry for C-

     13.6.4.9. Procedures for C-130 aircraft litter off-loading. Off-loading procedures are the
     reverse of the loading procedures for each litter position. AECM positioning will remain
     the same.
  13.6.5. C-17 Aircraft Litter Loading Procedures.
     13.6.5.1. When on/offloading patients, pay attention to the elevated area around the edge
     of the Litter Station Augmentation Set (LSAS) (this area could be a potential tripping
     hazard). Spotter(s) should be used to ensure litter bearers are aware of the hazard. When
     on/offloading patients of excessive weight or with excessive equipment requiring more
     than a four-person carry, extra caution should also be used.
     13.6.5.2. The LSAS will remain onboard the aircraft during patient loading/offloading.
     Exception: in the rare event that a specific patient's condition, equipment needs or size
     raises serious safety concerns, the LSAS box may be removed from the aircraft for
     increased clearance. The PIC, with coordination between the MCD and LM, is the final
     authority in determining if the LSAS should be removed to facilitate patient
     on/offloading. MCD should request ground handling equipment, as required, on the
     offload message.
     13.6.5.3. Litter arms should be positioned and secured with brackets open on all
     identified litter tiers. When configured to an AE-2 with the LSAS positioned on the ramp
     in the aerial delivery system (ADS) rails, the most aft litter arms can be removed before
     loading if they present a safety hazard. Reposition the removed litter arms prior to
     loading that specific litter tier.
     13.6.5.4. A four person carry can be utilized throughout the C-17 cargo compartment.
     WARNING: To ensure patient safety when loading/unloading litter stations, two
     AECMs will maintain control of the litter until it is safely locked into the stanchion or
     cleared the stanchion for deplaning.
     13.6.5.5. When loading CCATT/oversized litters up to a 6 person carry can be utilized.
     It is at the AECMs discretion not to release any of the litter bearers to assist with loading.
     AECMs are responsible for control and verbal commands of litter loading.
     13.6.5.6. Litter position at or above waist level:
         13.6.5.6.1. AECMs will direct the litter bearers to the litter station.
         13.6.5.6.2. Without setting the litter down, the AECMs will take the inside litter
         handle and then direct the litter bearers to take the outside handle.
         13.6.5.6.3. The AECMs will secure the outside bracket. Direct litter bearers to exit
         the aircraft.
     13.6.5.7. Loading into litter positions below waist level:
         13.6.5.7.1. AECMs will direct the litter bearers to the litter station.
         13.6.5.7.2. Direct litter bearers to lower litter to the floor next to the litter station.
         13.6.5.7.3. AECMs will take the inside litter handle and then direct the litter bearer to
         maintain outside litter handles.

     the reverse of the loading procedures for each litter position. AECM positioning will
     remain the same.
  13.6.7. Engines Running On-load (ERO).
     13.6.7.1. For AE missions, an ERO is authorized for contingency operations or during
     non-contingency AE missions when requirements dictate minimum ground time. EROs
     will not be used in a non-contingency environment unless mission essential. ERO
     procedures may be practiced/trained during ARMs, joint training operations, exercises,
     etc. Refer to 13.6.2 for proper hand signals.      WARNING: Eye protection will be
     worn outside the aircraft during all ERO procedures.   EXCEPTION: For the C-17,
     eye protection is not necessary, except when operating in parking areas where flying
     debris could be picked up from engine exhaust.

     13.6.7.3. AECM’s may exit the aircraft to conduct ground duties if not contraindicated
     by Intel/SPINS (Special Instructions).
     13.6.7.4. The loadmaster will be positioned in a location to observe safety and on
     headset during actual on-load procedures. The LM will observe for aircraft threats, and
     will enforce compliance with safety requirements.
     13.6.7.5. A spotter is provided by the ground AE element and is positioned 50 feet aft of
     the aircraft ramp.
         13.6.7.5.1. The spotter’s primary responsibility is to indicate to the ground element
         when the AEC are ready for patient loading, and to start/slow/stop the flow of
         patients as needed.
         13.6.7.5.2. The spotter monitors the litter-bearers to determine if assistance is needed
         and to ensure safe practices are maintained around the aircraft (i.e. prevent litter
         bearers from entering the prop wash/jet blast etc.)
     13.6.7.6. Cross-loading. Patients will normally be cross loaded during EROs depending
     on the aircraft configuration and cargo requirements.
     13.6.7.7. For the C-130, litters will be brought onboard as safety considerations allow
     and loaded forward to aft/top to bottom.
     13.6.7.8. Baggage will be loaded on the aircraft ramp and will not impede emergency
     egress.
     13.6.7.9. If duties permit, loadmasters will assist AECMs with securing baggage.
  13.6.8. Baggage Procedures: The 3AET is responsible for patient baggage procedures.
     13.6.8.1. Accompanied patient baggage will receive expeditious handling and will be
     processed separately from passenger baggage. Anti-hijack inspection of all persons and
     hand-carried articles transported in the AE system is required. While this is normally
     accomplished by the originating MTF, the MCD will ensure anti-hijacking statement is
     included on AF IMT 3851. All baggage requires inspection.
     13.6.8.2. The 3AET will ensure all baggage is tagged with a DD Form 600 and reflected
     on the original baggage manifest. The original baggage manifest will be given to the
     MCD at the end of the mission and filed with mission paperwork.
     13.6.8.3. Due to space limitations onboard the aircraft, all patients and attendants are
     limited to one hand-carried item. If hand-carried baggage will not fit under the patient’s
     seat and is stored in the cargo compartment, a DD Form 1839 will be accomplished.
     13.6.8.4. Patients will not be permitted access to checked baggage.
  13.6.9. Baggage Restrictions. Special care will be exercised by all AE agencies to ensure
  that stowed and hand-carried baggage does not contain unauthorized weapons, explosive
  devices, or unauthorized drugs.
     13.6.9.1. Stowed baggage will be restricted to suitcases, duffel bags, hand bags, B-4
     bags, A-2/3 bags, foot lockers, garment bags, or strong, durable cardboard boxes capable

      plus width plus height), or exceeding 70 pounds will not be accepted as stowed baggage.
      NOTE: On the C-21, patients and attendants will be limited to one stowed bag not
      exceeding 30lbs. In addition one hand carried article (brief case, laptop case, purse) may
      be carried. If extra baggage is carried, it will be processed by the sending facility into the
      Traffic Management System.
      13.6.9.2. Total baggage weight for each patient or attendant will not exceed 70 pounds.
   13.6.10. Patient/Attendant Unaccompanied Baggage. Unaccompanied baggage will not be
   transported onboard AE aircraft.

      from flight will be off-loaded prior to departure.
      13.6.10.2. Aircrew will not accept unaccompanied baggage unless the baggage has been
      processed through traffic management office (TMO) or installation transportation office
      (ITO) and arrives to the aircraft as freight.
      13.6.10.3. Baggage that becomes separated from the owner becomes freight. Direct
      personnel to turn unaccompanied baggage over to TMO/ITO for proper manifesting.
13.7. En Route Duties (T-1).
   13.7.1. AECMs are responsible for properly securing aeromedical equipment, hand-carried
   baggage, and any other miscellaneous items in the aircraft cabin. Ensure all seat belts and
   litter straps are securely fastened; and that the cabin area is properly prepared for takeoff or
   landing. Unsecured items are a hazard in the event of rapid decompression or aircraft
   emergency. NOTE: Before advising the MCD of ―Cabin Secure IAW the AECM
   checklist, the appropriate AET must complete a final check of the cabin to ensure all loose
   items are secured;seat backs are in the full upright position (if applicable), all seat belts and
   litter straps are securely fastened; and the cabin area is properly prepared for
   takeoff/landing.13.7.2. LM/BOs, or other members of the flight crew, are responsible for
   ensuring information briefings highlight the following areas:
      13.7.2.1. Emergency signals and passenger evacuation.
      13.7.2.2. Use of emergency oxygen equipment and LPU (if applicable)
      13.7.2.3. Location of restroom. NOTE: The AEC are not passenger monitors. When
      crew duties permit, AECMs will make every effort to assist the LM/ BO in
      accomplishing their passenger-related duties.
   13.7.3. Mission Delays. To preclude unnecessary patient holding on the flight line, aircraft
   departure times are not established on the basis of an estimated time in commission (ETIC).
   Departure times will be scheduled only on the basis of Fully Mission Capable (FMC).
   NOTE: The MCD should immediately notify the applicable C2 agency of any mission
   delays.
      13.7.3.1. The MCD must be cognizant that guidelines are not a substitute for sound
      judgment. Decisions should be put into action only after making a thorough assessment
      of the patient’s medical needs and considering surrounding circumstances. With this in
      mind, the following guidance is offered:
 96                                                           AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


          13.7.3.1.1. If the delay exceeds 1 hour, ambulatory patients should be deplaned to a
          rest area such as a lounge or terminal facility. These patients remain the responsibility
          of the AECMs. If feasible, litter patients should be evaluated and appropriate action
          taken for their care. Meals may be obtained for patients by utilizing AF IMT 15,
          United States Air Force Invoice. Keep patients informed of the current situation.
          13.7.3.1.2. Once the mission is in delay and the aircraft ETIC is more than 3 hours
          after scheduled departure, consider moving all patients to the nearest medical facility
          capable of supporting patient requirements. Before the actual movement of patients
          takes place, contact the appropriate C2 agency (TACC/AETC) for consultation and
          assistance. The C2 agency must be promptly notified of the problem as the facts are
          known. NOTE: Ground transportation time to the MTF should be considered.
13.8. Mission Termination. (T-1) The following tasks must be completed by AECMs before
an AE mission may be terminated:
   13.8.1. Disconnect all medical equipment and personal flying gear after patients have been
   deplaned.
   13.8.2. Accomplish applicable inventories.
   13.8.3. The MCD/CMT will ensure:
      13.8.3.1. AECM aircraft interior cleaning tasks are completed, which includes the
      cleaning and proper disposal of blood and/or body fluids from the aircraft.
      13.8.3.2. Trash and all disposable medical supplies are collected for removal by aircraft
      services.
      13.8.3.3. The aircraft is properly secured at RON points as specified in local directives.
      13.8.3.4. All aircraft systems discrepancies/malfunctions have been reported to the
      LM/BO for repair by maintenance personnel.
      13.8.3.5. All inoperative medical equipment is properly identified and tagged with an
      AFTO IMT 350.
      13.8.3.6. All medical equipment is removed, cleaned and stowed properly.
   13.8.4. A post mission debrief has been conducted to give crewmembers the opportunity to
   discuss all aspects of the mission. The degree of debrief formality and length will depend on
   the mission’s complexity, but one will be conducted after all AE missions. MCD will
   complete End of Mission Report with AE Cell in the 618 AOC (TACC) for AMC missions
   and appropriate AOC/AMD for theater missions.

                                    AE MISSION SAFETY

20.1. Safety Responsibilities and Precautions. (T-1) All AECMs are responsible for enforcing
and observing safety measures while performing the patient airlift mission.
   20.1.1. Emergency procedures outlined in aircraft T.O.s, required directives, and abbreviated
   checklists must be reviewed frequently to ensure fully coordinated action of all AECMs.
   20.1.2. AECMs must remain alert for unusual occurrences and immediately report any safety
   hazard to the MCD or PIC.
   20.1.3. Adherence to Crew Resource Management (CRM) procedures/practices and constant
   situational awareness are keys to safe mission accomplishment.
   20.1.4. Abbreviated checklists will be open to the appropriate phase of flight from preflight
   briefing through mission termination.
20.2. Ground Safety. (T-1) As prescribed by AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement
on the Ground, personnel in the immediate area of an operating aircraft will wear hearing
protection. AECMs must exercise extreme caution during all ground procedures.
   20.2.1. A high accident potential exists due to noise level, vehicle activity around the
   aircraft, blackout/low-light conditions and inclement weather.
   20.2.2. No Smoking is allowed within 50-feet of the aircraft.
20.3. Guidelines for Vehicle Drivers. (T-1) Vehicle operators will follow the guidelines
prescribed in AFMAN 24-306_IP, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Driver. NOTE: Vehicle
supervision, movement, and placement in and around the aircraft are the responsibility of the
CMT with concurrence of the LM/BO, or PIC (as applicable).
   20.3.1. All vehicular movement around the aircraft must maintain the 10-foot ―circle of
   safety‖ from the nose, tail and wingtips of the aircraft. Any movement required within this
   circle will be directed by the CMT with concurrence of the LM/BO.
   20.3.2. All vehicles approach parked aircraft with the driver side of the vehicle toward the
   aircraft.
   20.3.3. The spotter pre-positions wheel chocks between the aircraft and vehicle within the 10
   foot ―circle of safety‖, to prevent vehicles from damaging the aircraft. Additional vehicles
   can be parked without chocks (no closer than 10 feet to the aircraft) providing a chocked
   vehicle is between the un-chocked vehicle and the aircraft. Chocks will remain in position
   until the vehicle(s) are ready for movement.
   20.3.4. Vehicles parked on the flight-line will remain unlocked with the key in the ignition.
   If the vehicle driver does not remain in the drivers’ seat after parking, the ignition must be
   turned off and the parking brake applied. In addition, the gear lever will be placed in a gear
   on vehicles with standard transmission, park for vehicles with automatic transmission. These
   requirements are not necessary if a driver remains behind the wheel at all times.
   20.3.5. Only vehicles required to enplane/deplane patients or passengers or service the
   aircraft are permitted to approach the aircraft after it has blocked in. All vehicles will stand

   clear until directed to proceed towards aircraft. More than one vehicle may be positioned in
   the vicinity of the aircraft; however, only one vehicle may be in motion toward the aircraft at
   any one time.
   20.3.6. AE ground support vehicles will be positioned near the ramp entrance for aircraft set
   up, enplaning/deplaning of AE medical equipment/supplies.
   20.3.7. The AMBUS and/or ambulances will be positioned near the ramp entrance.
   Additional AMBUSs and/or ambulances may be parked next to the first AMBUS and/ or
   ambulance, to expedite enplaning/deplaning patients.
20.4. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles.
   20.4.1. When patients are seated in side facing seats, the LM/BO will ensure there is
   sufficient space between the cargo and the seats to permit patient’s leg room.
       20.4.1.1. When the load consists of palletized netted cargo or is secured with straps or
       chains, a 30-inch space will be maintained between the cargo and the nearest forward
       litter or occupied seat.
       20.4.1.2. At least one unobstructed emergency exit is available for each 20 patients /
       troops. (This does not restrict over water flights if the three overhead escape hatches are
       available for egress.). Litters and seats erected across an emergency exit are not
       considered an obstruction. WARNING: For KC-135, PSPs, SLSs, and litters cannot be
       placed in front of hatches. Use appropriate PSP extensions to ensure egress route is
       unobstructed.
       20.4.1.3. Do not secure aircraft or medical equipment adjacent to an emergency exit in a
       manner that will prevent or impede egress.
       20.4.1.4. During egress, ramps on all aircraft may be used if already deployed and
       unobstructed.
20.5. Equipment Procedures. CAUTION: When heavy or bulky equipment is rolled up/down
the aircraft ramp, ensure an adequate number of personnel are available to prevent injury to
personnel, or damage to equipment.
   20.5.1. Equipment that may be rolled up/down the ramp of C-130 and C-17:
       20.5.1.1. Adult ventilators.
       20.5.1.2. Unoccupied transport incubators, securely attached to a wheeled frame or
       containing integral wheels. EXCEPTION: An occupied neonatal transport system
       (NTS) may be rolled up or down ramps due to the weight of the NTS. Ensure the infant is
       properly secured inside the incubator. Four or more people will enplane/deplane the
       NTS. (T-1) The MCD and CMT should use good judgment and common sense to carry
       out this operation in a safe manner. Occupied or unoccupied NTS will not be rolled up or
       down PLS, jarring may damage components.
       20.5.1.3. Unoccupied ambulance-type stretchers/gurneys.
       20.5.1.4. Air compressors with integral wheels.

     20.5.1.6. Pressurized gas cylinders secured to wheeled dollies. NOTE: Regulators must
     be removed and cylinders capped prior to enplaning/deplaning. Only cylinders with caps
     are accepted. (T-1) EXCEPTION: Cylinders carried as part of a system (transport
     incubator, etc.) with cylinders in their applicable transport compartment do not need to be
     capped.
     20.5.1.7. Compressed gas cylinders may be utilized as a source to provide oxygen or
     other compressed gas on any AE mission. These cylinders provide the drive pressure and
     gas mixes for ventilator patients and supplemental oxygen as required. When a patient is
     delivered to their final destination and the cylinders are deplaned, they will be prepared
     for return shipment as hazardous cargo per AFJMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous
     Materials for Military Air Shipment. When the same aircraft returns to home station
     where the cylinders originated, they may remain onboard as aeromedical equipment.
     Always have the regulators removed and the cylinder capped when returning cylinders.
        20.5.1.7.1. H-Tank securing procedure. To secure H-size compressed air cylinders
        on-board the aircraft, the following components are required: two cargo tie-down
        straps per H-tank, one piece of ¾” plywood sheet (20”X14”) to utilize as shoring.
        20.5.1.7.2. Place ¾” plywood on the cargo floor or PSP. A blanket is not adequate
        for shoring.
        20.5.1.7.3. The H-tank should be placed securely against the inner aspect of the
        stanchion. Use non-conducting material (i.e. cotton blankets) to prevent metal to
        metal contact.
        20.5.1.7.4. Secure the H-tank with two cargo tie-down straps placed on the upper and
        lower portion of the H-tank.
        20.5.1.7.5. H-tanks will be capped prior to transport on and off the aircraft. (T-1)
  20.5.2. Minimum of a four (4) person carry is required for enplaning/deplaning the
  following: (T-1)
     20.5.2.1. Lifting a litter patient above waist level.
     20.5.2.2. Litter patients of excessive weight or those required to be carried for long
     distances.
     20.5.2.3. Occupied civilian ambulance type stretchers/gurneys.
        20.5.2.3.1. Prior to placing a patient on or removing a patient from an ambulance
        gurney/stretcher, ensure the gurney/stretcher is in the lowest position, side rails are
        down, and wheels are locked or a member from the ambulance team has control of
        the gurney/ stretcher.
     20.5.2.4. Transport incubators with infants. (See exception in 20.5.1.2).
        20.5.2.4.1. Infant transport incubators are placed in any litter tier in the middle
        position. The infant’s head is positioned forward or aft within the incubator
        according to the manufacturer’s instruction. At least two (2) securing straps will be
        connected around the infant for takeoff, landing and in flight.
     20.5.2.5. Patients on Stryker Frames.

      20.5.2.6. When inclement weather creates a hazardous condition (e.g., icy or wet ramp).
      20.5.2.7. Whenever determined by the crew to be the safest method for
      enplaning/deplaning based on conditions. NOTE: Due to the limited aisle width onboard
      most aircraft, a switch to a two (2) person carry may be conducted in the interest of
      safety. Use good judgment prior to the switch, to prevent undue injury or strain to the
      two (2) person carry team. AECMs will switch back to 4-persons if lifting above waist
      level into litter stanchions. Ensure ramp extenders are placed/spaced to facilitate the safe
      loading/unloading of patients in the given operating environment (contingency, low-light,
      inclement weather etc.) Position spotters as required to ensure safe operations.
  20.5.3. A minimum three (3) person carry is required for the following: (T-1)
      20.5.3.1. Enplaning/deplaning a litter patient with a backrest. Two individuals are at the
      head of the litter and the third at the foot of the litter. Per the NOTE above, AECMs may
      revert to a two (2) person carry once inside the aircraft. Backrests will not be in the 90-
      degree position during enplaning/deplaning or during take-off and landing. The backrest
      may be changed to the 90-degree angle in-flight for patient comfort and care.
  20.5.4. Lifting litter patients into or out of an ambulance, AMBUS or a vehicle that does not
  have a ramp.
      20.5.4.1. Position one person at the foot of the litter and two persons on either side of the
      litter at the door of the vehicle to lift and assist in moving the litter.
      20.5.4.2. Vehicle doors will be physically secured or manually held in the open position
      when litter patients are being loaded/unloaded.
      20.5.4.3. As the litter is pulled out of the vehicle, the 2 individuals positioned at the sides
      of the litter will grasp the litter with one hand at or above the patient’s waist and one hand
      at the patient’s head. Position personnel in a way that they can safely hand the litter off
      to others as needed.
  20.5.5. Wheelchair patients/transporting battery powered wheelchairs.
      20.5.5.1. Position one (1) individual behind and two (2) forward of the patient in the
      wheelchair.
      20.5.5.2. Locate space in the aircraft cabin to secure the wheelchair. NOTE: When a
      wheelchair patient is scheduled for transport, the tasking C2 agency will ensure adequate
      space is available for wheelchair storage.
      20.5.5.3. Secure the wheelchair upright in the aircraft cabin. Ensure the wheelchair does
      not interfere with emergency egress or pose a safety hazard. To prevent wheelchair
      damage, do not over tighten cargo tie-down straps.
      20.5.5.4. Deactivate the battery. Remove the connection at the battery terminals or
      otherwise disconnect power source per manufactures guidance. WARNING: Do not
      charge the battery or electric wheelchairs via the aircraft electrical system. Ensure the
      battery is securely attached to the wheelchair. Do not remove the battery from the
      wheelchair. (T-1)
  20.5.6. Neonatal Transport System (NTS) securing procedures. The NTS will be secured on
  cargo aircraft and the PSP for transport. (T-1) Position wooden blocks under the NTS frame
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                    107


  to elevate the unit’s wheels off the cargo floor/PSP. (The wooden blocks prevent
  stress/pressure from being placed on the NTS wheels during transport.)
     20.5.6.1. Use four cargo tie-down straps to secure the NTS to the cargo floor/PSP. The
     clip-hook of each strap will be attached to the hole at each corner of the NTS upper
     handles. The other end of the four cargo tie-downs will be secured to D-rings on the
     cargo floor or in the PSP seat tracks. (T-1)
     20.5.6.2. Two AECMs are required when tightening the cargo tie-down straps, one on
     each end. Use caution not to over tighten the straps.
  20.5.7. Transport of PTLOX/NPTLOX. The PTLOX/NPTLOX system will be transported
  per provisions in AFMAN 24-204_IP. These units will be maintained per PTLOX T.O. 15X-
  2-8-1 and NPTLOX T.O. 15X2-5-22. (T-1)
     20.5.7.1. HQ AFMC-24-204-97-12 waiver allows shipment of up to twenty-five 10-liter
     units on military aircraft without establishing a means for overboard venting. Hazardous
     Materials Waiver AFSC-24-204-12-19. Clearance is granted to ship/transport up to
     twenty five 20-liter CRU-50/A Next Generation Portable Therapeutic Liquid Oxygen
     (NPTLOX) converters containing UN1073, Oxygen Refrigerated Liquid, per aircraft
     without overboard venting. Waiver AFSC-24-204-12-19 will accompany PT lox
     shipments within the Defense Transportation System. EXCEPTION: This waiver does
     not apply to C-21. To enhance safety, when shipping more than six PTLOX containers
     as cargo, do not cover the PTLOX pallet with plastic; this may create accumulation of
     high oxygen concentrations. Ensure the cargo floor is free from any oil or other
     petroleum based products.
     20.5.7.2. An exception to policy to AMCI 24-101 V11, Cargo and Mail Policy, allows
     AECs to carry PTLOX as professional gear when positioning and de-positioning for
     operational AE missions and contingency support operations. The exceptions to policy
     are:
         20.5.7.2.1. The PTLOX/NPTLOX does not require HAZMAT certification.
         20.5.7.2.2. Venting is not required.

         20.5.7.3.4. Determine proper placement of PTLOX/NPTLOX on the aircraft with
         direction from the PIC and LM/BO.
  20.5.8. Defibrillation Procedures. To safely defibrillate a patient positioned on the aircraft
  floor, place a dry, woolen/cotton blanket under the patient. If any part of the patient contacts
  the floor, the distribution of current may be affected, resulting in the patient receiving less
  than the programmed amount of defibrillating current and/or possible skin burns. When
 108                                                          AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014


   monitoring electrodes are attached to the patient, the ground electrode possesses a ground
   potential.
       20.5.8.1. Patients may be defibrillated on litters with aluminum handles. Normal safety
       precautions must be followed (i.e., avoid direct contact with the patient or any portion of
       the litter during the procedure).
20.6. In-Flight Safety Procedures.
   20.6.1. All patients, regardless of age, will be assigned a seat. (T-1) The parent or guardian
   has the option to hold the infant or place them in an FAA approved infant car seat (ICS) in
   the assigned seat.
       20.6.1.1. The FAA has banned the use of booster seats, harness and vest child restraints.
       20.6.1.2. When a parent or attendant holds a child/infant, the seat belt is never placed
       around both the parent/attendant and the child/infant.
       20.6.1.3. In the event of turbulence, the weight of the adult against the child/infant could
       result in injury to the child/infant. The attendant will secure the seat belt around their
       waist, with the seat belt securing mechanism secured to the aisle side of the attendant (if
       possible) to prevent the child/infant from sitting on the securing mechanism. (T-1) A
       litter strap is placed through the seat belt, around the child/infant, and then secured.
       Additional padding should be placed between the child and the litter strap buckle.
       20.6.1.4. When a small child occupies a seat, a pillow (if available) or some type of
       padding (i.e., blanket) should be placed between the child and the seat belt securing
       mechanism. Acceptable child/infant safety seats/restraints may be used during all phases
       of flight in forward or aft facing seats. NOTE: These types of seats/restraints will not
       normally be used in side facing (web type) seats, to transport patients or attendants. (T-1)
       Passenger Services has approved the transport of passengers requiring child/ infant safety
       seats/restraints in side facing (web type) seats.
       20.6.1.5. If the aircraft is equipped with airline type seats, seat children/infants in
       child/infant seats/restraints by the fuselage with an adult in the aisle or middle seat.
       20.6.1.6. An adult must be able to reach emergency oxygen/life vest under all
       circumstances.
       20.6.1.7. Never seat young children where they are required to distribute oxygen masks.
       Ensure parents with young children can reach the oxygen mask container.
       20.6.1.8. Pregnant patients will be secured with a small pillow (if available) or some type
       of padding (i.e., blanket, etc.) between their lower abdomen and the seat belt.(T-1) The
       seat belt is secured under the abdomen, across the hips.
   20.6.2. Crewmembers should keep one hand free in-flight, if possible, to allow for
   stabilization in the event of turbulence.
   20.6.3. Smoking in aircraft lavatories is a federal offense. Patients or passengers smoking in
   lavatories or tampering with detectors (if applicable) will be deplaned, medical condition
   permitting, at the next en route stop.(T-1) Local authorities will be alerted of the offense.(T-
   1) Notify tasking AE C2 agency for patient offenses, 618 AOC (TACC) for passenger
   offenses and document actions/details on AF IMT 3829, (or TRAC2ES equivalent).

provide crews visibility over monthly flying activities. AMC and AMC-gained aircrews (except
those on standby at home station) will have an SRT established on their flight orders.
Scheduled Takeoff Time—Takeoff time is established in the schedule or OPORD. For air
aborts and diversions, this will be engine shut down time (or arrival in the blocks if engine
shutdown is not scheduled) plus authorized ground time. Early deviation does not apply to aborts
or diversions unless the mission is formally rescheduled by current operations.
Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM)—Funded airlift that cannot be supported by
channel missions because of the unusual nature, sensitivity, or urgency of the cargo or that
requires operations to points other than the established channel structure.
Special Category Patients—A special patient is any patient who can be considered at
significant risk being aeromedically evacuated. To designate a patient as ―special‖ is a matter of
judgment based on many factors. Among these are the patient’s clinical status and degree of
stability, amount of time between origination and destination MTF, and duration of individual
AFI11-2AEV3 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                      123


missions if more than one is needed to move. Special patients can be designated by the
MCD/FN, PMCC, VFS or responsible physician and must be coordinated through the PMRC.
Stage Management System—The AMC Stage Management System is activated by TACC/XOZ
when necessary to maximize airlift/air-refueling/aeromedical evacuation (AE) capability.
Staging aircrews at critical locations minimizes the time aircraft spend on the ground awaiting
rested aircrews. This is a force multiplier providing significantly increased airlift, air refueling
and AE capability.
Stations Time (Air Force)—Normally, 30 minutes prior to takeoff time for the KC-10, KC-135,
C-130, and OSA aircraft (45 minutes for C-5 and C-17). Aircrews will have completed their
preflight duties and be at their crew positions. Passengers will be seated and cargo will be
secured.
Theater Patient Movement Requirements Center (TPMRC)—The TPMRC is responsible for
theater wide patient movement (e.g., medical regulating and AE scheduling), and coordinates
with theater MTFs to allocate the proper treatment assets required to support its role. The
primary role of the TPMRC is to devise theater plans and schedules and then monitor their
execution in concert with the GPMRC. The TPMRC is responsible to the Combatant
Commander through the Combatant Command Surgeon. The TPMRC is also responsible for all
aspect of intratheater patient movement management. A TPMRC provides command and control
for patient movement management operations in its theater of operations, as directed by its
Combatant Commander’s operational policy, and in coordination with USTRANSCOM, acting
as a supporting combatant command, responsible for intertheater and CONUS patient movement.
Time Out—Common assertive statement used to voice crewmember concern when safety may
be jeopardized.
Training Mission—Mission executed at the unit level for the sole purpose of aircrew training
for upgrade or proficiency. Does not include operational missions as defined in this AFI.
Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)—Formerly known as the Airlift Service
Industrial Fund (ASIF) and Defense Business Operations Fund−Transportation (DBOF−T). Part
of the overall Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). Used to finance airlift costs that are
billed/reimbursed from an air mobility customer. Examples include aircrew TDY costs,
utilities/maintenance and repair of TWCF-assigned facilities, civilian pay costs of TWCF-
assigned personnel, airlift unit level mission planning expenses, and TDY costs for deployed
TWCF units/personnel.
Unilateral—Operations confined to a single service.

        or Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS) may be used if oxygen mask/eye
        protection is not available. NOTE: The MA-1 portable oxygen bottle delivers 100%
        oxygen at all settings. The regulator does not have to be turned to emergency to
        provide 100% oxygen. WARNING: Removal of oxygen masks when smoke or fumes
        are present can result in personal injury or death.

        WARNING: Although Halon 1211 vapor has a low toxicity, its decomposition
        products can be hazardous. On decomposition, Halon 1211 has a characteristic sharp,
        acrid odor, even in concentrations of only a few parts per million. The odor provides a
        built-in warning system for the agent and at the same time creates a noxious, irritating
        atmosphere for those who are in the hazard area during and following a fire. Leave
        and/or ventilate area after fighting a fire. NOTE: To use the Halon 1211 fire
        extinguisher, hold a vertical position, about eight feet from the fire. Remove the pull-
        ring pin and aim nozzle at base of the fire. Squeeze lever and sweep agent across base
