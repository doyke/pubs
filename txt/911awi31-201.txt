                  DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM


AFI 31-204, CHAPTER 5, TABLE 5.1.

Violation: Driving while driver’s license or installation driving privileges are under suspension or

Assessment: 2. One-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation commander.
Violation: Refusal to submit to or failure to complete chemical tests (implied consent).

Assessment: 3. One-year revocation is mandatory on conviction.

1. Manslaughter (or negligent homicide by vehicle) resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle.
2. Driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverage
and blood alcohol content is 0.08% or greater.
3. Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of any narcotic or while under the influence of any
other drug (including alcohol) to the degree rendered incapable of safe vehicle operation.
4. Use of a motor vehicle in the commission of a felony.

ownership or operation of motor vehicles.

911AWI31-201 14 MARCH 2008                                                                                 13


NOTES:
1. When imposing a suspension or revocation because of an off-installation offense, the effective date is
the same as the date of civil conviction or the suspension or revocation date of state or host nation driving
privileges. This effective date can be retroactive.
2. No points are assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions. Except for implied consent
violations, base revocations on a conviction by a civilian court, military courts-martial, no judicial
punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, or a separate hearing as otherwise addressed in this
instruction. If revocation for implied consent is combined with another revocation such as one year for
intoxicated driving, revocations may run consecutively (total of 24 months) or concurrently (total of 12
months). Apply the installation commander’s policy systematically and not on a case-by-case basis.
5.2. The Traffic Point System. The traffic point system provides a uniform administrative device to impar-
tially judge service personnel's driving performance. This system is not a disciplinary measure or a substi-
tute for punitive action. Further, this system is not intended to interfere in any way with the reasonable
exercise of an installation commander’s prerogative to issue, suspend, revoke, deny, or reinstate installa-
tion driving privileges.
5.3. Point System Application. The use of the point system and procedures prescribed herein are manda-
tory. The point system applies to civilian personnel operating government vehicles on and off the installa-
tion and to their POVs driven on-base. It applies to military personnel operating GOVs and POVs on or
off the installation and to dependents, civilian employees, and all other individuals subject to this instruc-
tion operating POVs on the installation. Unless an individual submits a rebuttal, assess points according
to the Table 5.2. Also assess points to individuals found guilty by a military or civilian court, or upon pay-
ment of fine or forfeiture of pay and allowances, or posted bond or collateral. Do not use the point system
for non-moving violations.
Table 5.2. Point Assessment for Moving Violations (See Note 1).
