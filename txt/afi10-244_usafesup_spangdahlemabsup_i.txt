SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision incorporates Interim Change (IC) 2005-1 and aligns this guidance with the results of the
Rapid Improvement Event to improve Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF) Reporting Tool (ART) data
fidelity and the reporting process. IC 2005-1 updates paragraphs, 1.5.2., 1.6.4.1., 2.7.3.1., 2.7.4.2., 3.3.,
3.4.7.4., 3.5., 3.7., and 3.8.1. IC 2005-1 also inserts paragraphs 2.4.1. and 2.6.3.1. This change requires
units to report a Unit Type Code’s (UTC) current and future ability to fulfill its Mission Capability State-
ment (MISCAP). Individuals are now required to report changes in their status to their supervisor, Unit
Deployment Manager, and unit commander. Each MAJCOM, FOA and DRU must assign ART Admin-
AFI10-244_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 30 MAY 2008                                                                                                     3


istrators in writing and units should assign ART OPRs to that position for 18 months. Individual training
not required by the UTC (MISCAP or manpower detail) will not affect the readiness assessment. Check-
lists will be used to assess the overall health of a UTC. All status remarks will be standardized remarks
from the Standard Assessment Remarks listing maintained within ART. Significant events that change
the assessment of a UTC are only required for the current plus two rotations. A bar ( | ) indicates a revi-
sion from the previous edition.
(USAFE) This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Extensive
changes in policies and procedures from the previous edition required a complete revision of this publica-
tion.
(SPANGDAHLEM) This interim change updates and adds crucial processes prescribed in paragraphs
2.7.3.8.1., 2.7.4.9.1., 2.7.6.5.3., 3.4.7.1.4., 3.4.7.1.4.1., 3.4.7.1.4.2., 3.4.7.1.4.3., 3.8.1.1., 3.8.1.2., 3.8.1.3.

                                                Chapter 1

                   EXPEDITIONARY AEROSPACE FORCE (EAF) CONCEPTS

1.1. General. The Expeditionary Aerospace Force (EAF) concept is how the Air Force organizes, trains,
equips, and sustains itself by creating a mindset and cultural state that embraces the unique characteristics
of aerospace power – range, speed, flexibility, and precision – to meet the national security challenges of
the 21st Century. The concept has two fundamental principles: first, to provide trained and ready aero-
space forces for national defense and second, to meet national commitments through a structured
approach which enhances Total Force readiness and sustainment.
   1.1.1. How to use this AFI. This AFI governs Unit Type Code (UTC) status reporting and the AEF
   Certification process. This instruction should be followed in the context of AFI 10-400 Expeditionary
   Air Force Planning and Operation, which contains planning considerations for these UTCs and a full
   description of Expeditionary Aerospace Force concepts. Chapter 1 contains the basic description of
   the EAF and the Aerospace Expeditionary Force UTC Reporting Tool (ART). Chapter 2 outlines
   roles and responsibilities in UTC reporting. Chapter 3 describes assessment and reporting policies.
   Chapter 4 focuses on the Certification process.

1.2. Force Presentation. The United States Air Force (USAF) has organized its Total Force into Aero-
space Expeditionary Forces (AEFs); dedicated on-call Aerospace Expeditionary Wings (AEWs); Lead
Mobility Wings (LMWs); and required Air Operations Center (AOC) and Air Force Forces (AFFOR)
Command and Control (C2) elements. Available Air Force unit type codes (UTCs) have been equitably
aligned across ten AEFs and two AEW libraries so each possess roughly equal capabilities. These librar-
ies provide a composite of capabilities from which force packages are developed and tailored to meet mis-
sion requirements, while AOC and AFFOR C2 elements provide the operational level C2 required for
AEW mission accomplishment. The LMWs provide trained leadership to support short notice taskings
such as humanitarian relief operations (HUMROs) or noncombatant evacuation operations (NEOs). Spe-
cifically tailored forces are presented to theater commanders as Aerospace Expeditionary Task Forces
(AETFs). Refer to Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 2 for doctrinal guidance on force presentation.
In addition to the AEFs and AEWs, the EAF will include strategic “enabler” or common user assets, such
as long-range mobility, Special Operations Forces (SOF), and space forces, that will provide support to
authorized organizations within and outside of the Department of Defense (DOD), including Air Force
movements of AEF forces. Also postured as enablers, the Air Force’s Low Density/High Demand (LD/
HD) assets (U2, E-8 JSTARS, E-3 AWACS, RC-135 RIVET JOINT, SOF, CSAR, etc.), will play critical
roles in AEF/AEW operations, subject to the governing directives of the Global Military Force Policy
(GMFP).

1.3. Spectrum of Operations. The National Military Strategy dictates that the Air Force be prepared to
support requirements across the spectrum of operations from humanitarian and disaster relief operations
up to and including major war (MW). The Air Force will meet its day-to-day steady-state deployed oper-
ational commitments using the UTCs assigned to the two on-call AEFs, one on-call AEW, and available
enabler forces. Any substantial or sustained commitment of forces beyond this level will constitute a
surge for the Air Force, which will require some degree of reconstitution of the involved forces after the
surge ends.

1.4. Force Management. The AEF libraries contain a finite amount of capability that at any given time
identifies forces that constitute the total force that has been made available/assigned for scheduling. The
10 AEFs are paired (e.g. AEF 1 and 2, AEF 3 and 4, etc.) into five 3-month contingency on-call/deploy-
ment eligibility period every 15 months. Each of the two dedicated on-call AEWs will alternate on
4-month on-call periods. As the EAF concept evolves, the on-call AEWs may be absorbed into the base-
line AEF structure. Most low density/high demand (LD/HD) assets, as defined in GMFP, are not formally
assigned to individual AEFs, but are aligned with deployment cycles in order to enhance deployment pre-
dictability. Deployment levels must be consistent with GMFP guidelines. Space, inter-theater airlift, and
Global Reach Laydown (GRL) forces normally will not be assigned to AEFs. Air refueling forces and
medium-range airlift forces (currently consisting of C-130 units) will be assigned to AEFs and enabler
operations, subject to careful scheduling to avoid over tasking.

1.5. Reporting AEF Status - General . To view the health of forces in the ten (10) designated AEF's,
AEWs, lead mobility wings and enablers, Air Force senior leadership determined a need to collect UTC
readiness status data from all AEF-allocated UTCs of sufficient detail to support the following goals:
    1.5.1. Provide Headquarters AF, AF Component Commanders, MAJCOM's, and the AEF Center
    (AEFC) readiness information to employ, manage, and sustain Expeditionary Air Force operations.
    1.5.2. Provide units a mechanism to report a UTC’s current and future (6 months out) ability or
    inability to fulfill its Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP) across the full ROMO, to include con-
    tingency and rotational operations, and highlight associated deficiencies within the UTC.
    1.5.3. Provide information to aid resource allocation and tasking decisions during steady state and
    crisis actions.

1.6. System Description: The AEF UTC Status Reporting Tool (ART) is designed to support the goals
listed above. ART allows AEF-allocated units the ability to report UTC level readiness data. It provides
one central location to archive reported data. It allows immediate updates and ready access to an aggre-
gate UTC status for all levels of command with sufficient depth of information to make informed deci-
sions on the employment of forces for AEF operations. It further provides a means for identifying and
analyzing actionable indicators of change.
    1.6.1. ART is a web-based, non-intrusive, html-environment tool with associated databases to sup-
    port collection, collation, and report generation of unit and aggregate UTC readiness data. It resides
    on the SIPRNET (http://aefcenter.langley.af.smil.mil) for secure access. Units that are allocated
    UTC taskings under AEF, view and report their status against these taskings directly on the ART web-
    site.
    1.6.2. ART's report generating capability allows all levels of command to arrange data to produce tai-
    lored written reports and graphics. The reports section is read-only and can be accessed by anyone
    with SIPRNET access.
    1.6.3. A fully functional training site exists on the NIPRNET
    (https://aefcenter.acc.af.mil/eafonline/ or https://aefcenter.acc.af.mil/art). This site also allows
    personnel to review the ART tutorial and other guidance. There are no restrictions on this site; anyone
    can login and enter training data or experiment with the report section. DO NOT enter real world data
    on the training site.

  1.6.4. Operationally, ART supports the goals stated above by collecting and collating unit-reported
  data to answer, in whole or in part, the following associated questions:
     1.6.4.1. Are AEF allocated UTCs able to accomplish their MISCAP defined mission if tasked
     today? If tasked any time within the next six months?
     1.6.4.2. Are AEF allocated UTCs able to accomplish their component tasked mission?
     1.6.4.3. Do adequate resources exist and is training available in order to accomplish and sustain
     the AEF mission(s)?
  1.6.5. ART complements readiness data reported in Status of Resources and Training Systems
  (SORTS). ART focuses reporting on the modular scalable capability-based UTC’s designed to meet
  the needs of the 21st century force while SORTS is unit-centric with reporting based on major war
  (MW) commitments. The basis for both systems is the Air Force Wide UTC Availability and Tasking
  Summary (AFWUS). The tasking baseline contained in ART is derived from the AEF Time Phased
  Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) library which supports the full spectrum of operations. Readiness
  assessments for MW and AEF tasking must be considered together however the reporting guidelines
  for each may be independent. A unit’s C level as reported in SORTS may not directly correlate to it’s
  ability to support a specific UTC tasking as indicated in ART.

                               ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. ART Reporting. Unit commander assessments reported in ART present the status of each UTC in
the AEF library; and they provide higher levels of command the necessary information to make force and
resource allocation decisions to effectively support theater commanders. Within the AEF construct, the
UTC assessments are used to determine the most effective force tasking. Effective management of Air
Force resources requires accurate information at all levels. For these reasons integrity in reporting an
accurate status is paramount. ART is not a report card, but a method of identifying a UTCs ability to per-
form its MISCAP and identify shortages of resources therefore, commanders must "tell it like it is."

2.2. Headquarters USAF.

     semi-annual recurring formal training for subordinate unit monitors. Training must be docu-
     mented and a record maintained at the wing/base level. All training will be documented using AF
     Form 2426.
         2.7.3.9.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEM) Commanders must obtain ART training within 60
         days after assuming command. Training may be obtained by attending group or personal ses-
         sions. The decision to receive either will be contingent on how many commanders require
         training and their schedule availability. Arrangements can be made by calling 52 LRS/
         LGRRC, DSN 452-6008.
     2.7.3.10. (Added-USAFE) Wing ART Managers will conduct ART SAVs to assist the unit ART
     monitors by ensuring compliance with USAF and USAFE directives. Self-Inspection checklists
     (use AF Form 2519, All Purpose Checklist, for local checklist design) must be completed every 6
     months and, not earlier than (NET) 60 days and not later than (NLT) 30 days prior to any sched-
     uled higher headquarters (HHQ) inspection and/or SAV.

     critical and therefore should be for a minimum of 18 months.
         2.7.4.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Units will identify no less than two ART Monitors and the status
         of each as either the primary or alternate to ensure uninterrupted reporting during both peace-
         time and contingencies regardless of unit TDY and leave activities. Date eligible for return
         from Overseas (DEROS) information and classified e-mail addresses must be submitted with
         all other POC data at the time of designation. The classified e-mail account can be the POC’s
         personal account, office account, group account or another member’s account that will pass
         along ART information and/or taskings in a timely fashion.
         2.7.4.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Designation letters must be provided to the Wing ART Manager.
         2.7.4.2.3. (Added-SPANGDAHLEM) Ensure optimum continuity and reporting effective-

     the change of a unit’s remark or status, since the remarks are unit and wing assessed, validated,
     and certified.
     2.7.6.3. (Added-USAFE) The appropriate FAM will ensure the Time Phased Force Deployment
     Data (TPFDD) Library is current and updated through the MAJCOM OPR (HQ USAFE/A3ZA)
     in a timely manner, ensuring UTC accuracy within the ART Program. Coordinate and notify
     TPFDD library discrepancies and actions with the affected wing/unit.
     2.7.6.4. (Added-USAFE) The appropriate FAM will consider ART status during wing/unit
     requested personnel, equipment or training reclamas and waivers (e.g. A reclama or waiver should
     not be approved if the requesting wing/unit has not identified the specific shortfall through the
     ART program).

        lation Deployment Officer, by 52 LRS/LGRRC and reported to approving authorities in the
        event of reclama actions. Commanders should be aware that unsubstantiated or incorrectly
        reported ART Unit Type Code (UTC) statuses will adversely impact the credibility of shortfall
        and reclama actions within the wing and the Major Command level.
        2.7.6.5.3. (Added-SPANGDAHLEM) DELETED.
     2.7.6.6. (Added-USAFE) All FAMs will take action on Bad/Incorrectly Postured UTCs not later

                                       REPORTING POLICIES

3.1. Classification. ART contains real world deployment and personnel data. It is incumbent on all per-
sonnel to be aware of the classification of data entered in ART. A UTC assessments in ART is classified
confidential, aggregate unit UTC reports are classified secret IAW Executive Order (EO) 12958. Do not
enter data that is classified under other guidance such as "Special Access Required" information.

3.2. ART Data Classification. Executive Order (EO) 12958, Classified National Security Information,
requires us to protect classified information while striking a balance between protection and the need to
inform the American public of their governmental activities. Additionally, this EO increases and empha-
sizes personal responsibility for classification and declassification decisions.
   3.2.1. Derivative Classification. Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing, restat-
   ing, or generating in a new form information that is already classified, and marking the newly devel-
   oped material consistent with the classification markings that apply on the source information.
       3.2.1.1. Derivative Classifier. Persons applying derivative classification markings must carry for-
       ward to any newly created document the classification markings from the original source or docu-
       ment.
       3.2.1.2. ART assessment data (i.e., color codes, missing resources detailed in remarks, and limit-
       ing factors) for a single UTC, is classified at a minimum CONFIDENTIAL.
       3.2.1.3. Aggregate ART assessments (two or more UTC assessments, certification messages) are
       classified SECRET. ART data converted to a new type information must be evaluated for its
       impact on national security if released.
       3.2.1.4. Data classification. Raw resource data used to derive UTC assessments is classified IAW
       it’s original source. When data is directly associated with an ART rating or used in an ART work-
       sheet, the data becomes classified IAW this guidance. Preformatted worksheets should be clearly
       marked with instructions on classification.
       3.2.1.5. Classification Authority. As with SORTS, ART combines elements of the JOPES data-
       base with assessments of the ability of units to provide combat capability. The assessments are
       used in the Air Force war-planning effort as a readiness feed to the Deliberate and Crisis Action
       Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) which parallels SORTS and JOPES war-planning
       capability. The Joint Staff SORTS database is classified SECRET. Information extracted from this
       database is classified IAW, CJCSI 3401.02 and must contain derivative classification markings
       consistent with EO 12958, except where authorized otherwise. Derivative classification rules
       apply when extracts contain exempted data. ART will follow this same rule set and classification
       guidance.
       3.2.1.6. Classification Marking. ART data or extracts are classified by this AFI. Mark documents
       or data “Declassify on: (date). The date of declassification is 4 years from the date of the document
       for each level of classification. Declassification timeline is 4 years for CONFIDENTIAL, 8 years
       for SECRET.
20                                  AFI10-244_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 30 MAY 2008


        3.2.1.7. Downgrading Authority. Initial downgrading of force readiness data and aggregate infor-
        mation will be determined by CJCS. HQ USAF/XO is the authority to extend or accelerate down-
        grading classification of ART and SORTS data following an initial determination by CJCS.

3.3. What to Report. Commanders will report the unit’s current ability through the next six months to
support each allocated UTC. NOTE: ART uses an extract of the approved UTC/UIC AEF assignment of
forces in the UTC Availability. A-UTCs are not currently reported in ART. ART is a source for AEF
UTC/UIC alignment for the unit commander.
     3.3.1. Units reporting SORTS with UTCs allocated to an AEF, Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) and
     lead mobility wing, or identified as an enabler shall continue to report SORTS IAW their Designed
     Operational Capability (DOC) statement and AFI 10-201, in addition to reporting in ART.

3.4. UTC Assessments. The assessments are based on the capability defined by the Mission Capability
Statement (MISCAP) to include manpower requirements and equipment detailed in the Manpower and
Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK). The Logistic Force Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR)
Logistics Detail (LOGDET) and Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) will be used to main-
tain the manpower and equipment requirements.
     3.4.1. Response Time. A UTC readiness assessment is based on resources that are expected to be mis-
     sion ready and available within their DOC response time, (if the UTC is referenced in the unit’s DOC
     statement), or within 72 hours of tasking or less depending on the UTC requirements. A UTC is eligi-
     ble to be tasked to perform its mission at any time.
     3.4.2. The Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP) provides a brief description of the capability for
     which the UTC is designed.
     3.4.3. The Logistic Force Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR) provides a list of equipment the UTC
     requires to perform the mission.
     3.4.4. The Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) contains the manpower detail required to
     provide the capability for a standard UTC.
     3.4.5. Commanders provide an assessment of UTC readiness based on the unit's ability to provide the
     UTC for mission execution at any time.
     3.4.6. Commanders are not constrained by the unit SORTS "C" rating when assessing the health of
     the UTC.
     3.4.7. Commanders rate each UTC against the unit's current ability to deploy and employ the UTC.
     Areas to be considered are personnel, equipment, training, and equipment condition. Personnel must
     be worldwide mobility qualified and have all required mission and skill level training complete IAW
     applicable directives and instructions. Equipment must be serviceable and available for deployment.
        3.4.7.1. IAW AFI 10-400 and applicable MAJCOM directives any deployment eligible personnel
        within the unit may be considered to fill the UTC personnel requirement as determined by the
        UTC manpower details.
            3.4.7.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Personnel are considered available if they are assigned to a unit,
            physically present at home station or can be present within the prescribed response time, and
            are not restricted from deploying or employing. The Military Personnel Data System
AFI10-244_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 30 MAY 2008                                                           21


         (MILPDS) deployment availability codes must support availability determination. Command-
         ers determine availability as required.
         3.4.7.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Personnel filling a UTC requirement may be considered avail-
         able to deploy if the projected TDY completion date is more than 30 days prior to their report
         not later than date (RNLTD), separation date, or retirement date.
         3.4.7.1.3. (Added-USAFE) When assessing the status of UTCs in ART, report skill level sub-
         stitutions as either Yellow or Red, if the substitutions are not specifically allowed in the UTC
         Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP). Report UTCs with skill level substitution as Yellow
         when they can meet the UTC MISCAP and include a remark specifying the skill level substi-
         tution. Report UTCs with skill level substitution as Red when they cannot meet the UTC MIS-
         CAP. This is not to be confused with skill level substitutions authorized during actual
         sourcing, as outlined in AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution.

            3.4.7.1.4.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEM) DELETED.
            3.4.7.1.4.2. (Added-SPANGDAHLEM) DELETED.
            3.4.7.1.4.3. (Added-SPANGDAHLEM) DELETED.
     3.4.7.2. Equipment and supplies on hand reporting includes the status of LOGFOR equipment
     and supplies required to support the UTC. It may indicate budget and supply problems when
     details are known. Commanders determine the readiness status based on the availability of mis-
     sion required equipment and supplies. Items are considered available if they are assigned to the
     unit and are physically present at the unit for deployment.
         3.4.7.2.1. Units should report the status of UTCs as stand-alone requirements. For “rain-
         bowed” UTCs where a UTC has both personnel and equipment requirements, but shares the
         equipment with a sister organization already deployed, the UTC should be assessed as Red,
         since it does not currently have the required equipment prior to deployment. For a rainbowed
         UTC a comment should be entered to indicate the status of the shared equipment.
         3.4.7.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Equipment and supplies are required to be available to redeploy
         within 72 hours, unless otherwise directed by the MAJCOM.
     3.4.7.3. The equipment condition area is used to determine the combat essential and support
     equipment that can be made ready within the UTC's response time to undertake the mission. Units
     assess the equipment condition for combat essential and support equipment based on the availabil-
     ity of required equipment.
     3.4.7.4. The training assessment area indicates the status of training needed to support the mission
     for which a UTC is designed (MISCAP). All personnel assigned to a UTC must have all required
     mission and skill level training completed IAW applicable directives and instructions at the time
     of assessment. Individual training not required by the UTC (MISCAP or manpower detail) will
     not affect the readiness assessment but will be captured for deployment readiness tracking.
  3.4.8. Commanders are expected to use their judgment during assessments of missing or deficient
  capabilities (i.e. shortage of one computer may not make a UTC red; shortage of one generator may,
  similarly a member on a 72 hour medical profile would not require a UTC status change, whereas a
22                                   AFI10-244_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 30 MAY 2008


     person with a broken leg would). Remarks should reflect training requirements and/or resource
     actions necessary to improve the readiness status.
     3.4.9. In addition and independent of the stoplight (Green, Yellow, Red) assessment, each unit will
     indicate if a UTC is tasked to deploy and, if tasked, whether it can meet theater specific requirements
     including line remarks IAW timing criteria.
     3.4.10. AFI 10-403 Deployment Planning and Execution issues directives relating to personnel sub-
     stitution. These directives apply for ART reporting purposes. For reporting purposes personnel substi-
     tutions reflected in the UTC MISCAP are authorized unless precluded in the deployment planning
     guidance.
     3.4.11. If a portion of a UTC is tasked to deploy, the remaining assets continue to be available for the
     entire deployment eligibility window. Commanders should indicate this in a remark.
     3.4.12. Commanders will continue to submit an overall UTC assessment that treats the deployed por-
     tion of that UTC as available and healthy unless circumstances/information warrants otherwise.

3.5. Assess the overall health of a UTC. The UTC represents a capability that is assessed using the cate-
gory areas described in paragraph 3.4.7. The overall assessment is rated using the following guidelines
and the ART Monitor Assessment checklist maintained within ART (ART Guidance under Information
Tab).
3.5. (USAFE) Theater-specific requirements are not assessed during the UTC assessment. This assess-
ment will be made during the “Tasked to Deploy Assessment” phase, once the UTC is tasked to deploy.
The “Tasked to Deploy Assessment” will not change the status (Red/Yellow/Green) of the UTC.
     3.5.1. Green = Go. All MEFPAK (MANFOR, LOGFOR) identified personnel, equipment and train-
     ing for the AEF allocated UTC are available for deployment within 72 hours of notification or sooner
     if subject to more stringent criteria. NOTE: UTC MISCAP or applicable DOC statement response
     times may be more stringent.
     3.5.2. Yellow = Caution. The UTC has a missing or deficient capability; but that missing or deficient
     capability does not prevent the UTC from being tasked and accomplishing its mission in a contin-
     gency and/or AEF rotation. Provide a detailed explanation of the shortfall in remarks. Describe the
     shortfall, the corrective action and provide a projected get-well date.
     3.5.3. Red = No Go. The UTC has a missing or deficient capability that prevents the UTC from being
     tasked and accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation. Provide detailed explana-
     tion of the shortfall in remarks. Describe the shortfall, the corrective action and provide a get-well
     date.
        3.5.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Assess UTCs when determined to be “bad" or "incorrectly postured”.
        Input specific rational as to why the UTC is suspected of being bad or incorrectly postured using
        the appropriate comment area on the deficiency screen. For "incorrectly" assessed UTCs, input the
        USAFE FAM's email address (listing provided at:
        https://rso.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-ED-FE-01).
            3.5.3.1.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEM) Following transmission of a Questionable UTC or
            incorrectly postured UTC message to the Functional Area Manager, unit ART monitors must
            report the UTC as “Black” and annotate “Questionable UTC or incorrectly postured UTC” in
AFI10-244_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 30 MAY 2008                                                               23


           the commander’s remarks block. Rationale should also be annotated. Units will maintain a
           copy of the Questionable UTC message.
   3.5.4. Note: when the database is updated, an automated e-mail will be sent to the appropriate MAJ-
   COM approved account holder indicating UTC(s) having a change. The owning organization is
   required to confirm that the UTC assessment is unchanged or to revise it as necessary.
   3.5.5. Think of the monthly assessment as a Yes/No process (Figure 3.1.). Additionally, a Yes/No
   process can be used when assessing if a UTC is tasked to deploy and if it can meet theater specific
   requirements (Figure 3.2.).

Figure 3.1. Monthly Assessment Process.




3.6. Tasked to Deploy Assessment. Upon deployment notification, commanders owning UTC’s tasked
to deploy, in whole or in part, are required to assess the UTCs ability to meet theater specific requirements
to include line remarks. This assessment is independent of the overall UTC stoplight assessment. As an
example, a UTC may not have a person with specific skill level and experience required by line remarks,
however the UTC status (Green, Yellow, Red) does not change since the stoplight assessment is based on
the UTCs ability to deploy anywhere in the world at the time of the assessment. Another example is a Red
UTC assessment due to equipment which could be tasked to support a personnel only theater requirement.
Even though it can meet that specific deployment tasking, the overall status is still Red.
   3.6.1. A Yes/No process can be used when assessing if a UTC is tasked to deploy and if it can meet
   theater specific requirements (Figure 3.2.).
24                                  AFI10-244_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 30 MAY 2008


Figure 3.2. Tasked to Deploy Assessment Process.




     3.6.2. (Added-USAFE) When UTC/ULN is marked as “Tasked - Yes” the unit ART monitor will
     identify what the UTC/ULN is tasked for in the remark area (i.e. line #, Plan Identification (PID),
     ULN, Estimated Tour Length (ETL), & any line remarks).
     3.6.3. (Added-USAFE) When a UTC is partially tasked and the unit can meet the theater require-
     ments, mark the UTC as “Tasked - Yes” and “Meets - Yes”. Additionally, the unit must provide a list
     of remaining available resources in the general/tasked remark area. The remark area becomes avail-
     able upon selecting “Yes” or “No” under the “can meet theater requirements” column.
     3.6.4. (Added-USAFE) When possible, units tasked to deploy under a non-postured UTC will iden-
     tify a postured UTC with similar requirements and mark it as “Tasked - Yes” and “Meets - Yes.” The
     unit must identify the actual tasked UTC in the general remark area.
     3.6.5. (Added-USAFE) When indicating “Meets - No” outline the planned action in the general
     remark area. Units will continually update the general/tasked remark area with the status of the waiver
     request or reclama until final disposition.

3.7. Remarks. Plain language supplemental remarks are a critical component of the ART report and are
used as a management tool. Remarks are required if a unit is less than fully capable in any reportable area.
Remarks are used to identify trends and to redirect resources if necessary. Remarks are mandatory for
UTCs assessed Yellow and Red. All status remarks will be standardized remarks from Standard Assess-
ment Remarks listing maintained within ART (ART Guidance under Information Tab) only. However, the
Commander’s Remarks section is an additional avenue that should be utilized to relay vital information
that affects the readiness or availability of the UTC. This area of ART can be utilized regardless of the
readiness status of the UTC (i.e., Green, Yellow, or Red).
AFI10-244_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 30 MAY 2008                                                              25


   3.7.1. Commanders use the remarks and associated get-well-dates (GWD) to explain and amplify
   data contained in ART reports. Write remarks in plain text English and ensure they contain all appro-
   priate details such as AFSCs, projected improvements, workarounds, etc. Remarks should be suffi-
   cient to allow responsible managers to take specific corrective action. The remarks sections are not
   size limited.
       3.7.1.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEM) Units annotating personnel deficiencies in any area will
       identify the Air Force Specialty Code with skill level and the exact position the person was identi-
       fied to fill in the UTC (i.e. Maintenance Expeditor, Crew Chief, Fuels Lab Supervisor, etc.)
   3.7.2. As applicable, list resource types with associated deficiencies; state numbers required,
   assigned, and available; explain the cause of the problem, if known; identify previously requested
   assistance; identify remedial actions in progress, highlight further actions required, and provide a pro-
   jection of when the readiness status will change.
   3.7.2. (USAFE) Deficiencies will be identified in the status remark area, by category: personnel,
   training, equipment/supply, and/or equipment/condition. These fields become available upon marking
   a UTCs status as “Red” or “Yellow”. The general remarks area associated with the tasked, can or can-
   not meet theater requirements will be used for tasked or partially tasked UTCs. The “Commanders
   Comments” option allows reporting commanders to provide additional information not covered by
   other comment and remarks fields. The use of this field should be minimized and not used to identify
   UTC deficiencies, since the status remark fields serve this purpose.
   3.7.3. Air Force standard abbreviations are acceptable. However, non-common, unique, or unit/sys-
   tem/functional specific acronyms will be defined when first used in a report. Do not refer to previous
   reports (ART is dynamic and will not retain previous remarks).
   3.7.4. Wing Commanders should challenge inadequate remarks. MAJCOMs will sample, review, and
   assess adequacy of unit remarks.

3.8. When to Report. All Air Force and Air Force gained units will submit and update UTC assessments
every 30 calendar days.
   3.8.1. Upon notification of a significant event that changes the assessment of a UTC for the current
   plus two AEF rotations (i.e.: AEF 1/2 + AEF 3/4 & 5/6), the unit commander will submit an
   out-of-cycle report within 24 hours of the change. This includes notification of a UTC change or addi-
   tion.
       3.8.1.1. (Added-USAFE) When an individuals DEROS month is in the current pair plus two
       AEF rotations (i.e.: AEF 1/2 + AEF 3/4 & 5/6) assess the UTC as Yellow or Red for a personnel
       deficiency.
       3.8.1.1. (SPANGDAHLEM) When an individual is 270 calendar days from his/her DEROS,
       assess the UTC "Yellow", and when an individual is 180 calendar days from his/her DEROS,
       assess the UTC "Red".
       3.8.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Unit, NAF and Directorate ART Monitors will check ART every
       Wednesday and Friday for Not Reported UTCs and will be assessed within 24 hours.
       3.8.1.2. (SPANGDAHLEM) Unit ART Monitors will check ART every Wednesday and Friday
       for Not Reported UTCs. These UTCs will be assessed within 24 hours.
26                                   AFI10-244_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 30 MAY 2008


        3.8.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Unit, NAF and Directorate ART Monitors will update the status of all
        postured UTCs during the last duty week of each month.
        3.8.1.3. (SPANGDAHLEM) Unit ART monitors will update the status of all posted UTCs on the
        second Thursday and last duty day of the month. The last duty day of the month update must be
        commander approved. Updates can be no earlier than four duty days prior to required update day.
        This will ensure up to date information for MAJCOM and AFPC briefing time lines.
     3.8.2. Additionally, commanders owning UTC's tasked to deploy will submit via ART an assessment
     of their ability to support the tasking, including theater specific requirements, within five (5) days of
     receipt of a deployment notification.
        3.8.2.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEM) Commanders will sign and maintain the Commander’s
        Approval Report for every monthly status update. This report must be accomplished every 30 days
        and signed regardless of whether a change to their UTCs has occurred or not.
     3.8.3. Units owning a UTC tasked to deploy will reset the deployment status from "Yes" to "No" not
     later than five (5) calendar days after the tasked resources return to home station.

3.9. Where to Report. ART is accessed from the AEF Center homepage located at the following URL
http://aefcenter.langely.af.smil.mil. Click on the “AEF UTC Reporting Tool” link. Users are required to
have SIPRNET access in order to submit ART updates.
3.10. (Added-USAFE) COMUSAFE ART Briefings. ART briefings are provided to COMUSAFE and
HQ USAFE 2-digits on a monthly basis. USAFE Readiness Measures and HQ USAFE/A3 determine
what ART data will be presented.
     3.10.1. (Added-USAFE) The HQ USAFE ART Manager will pull the ART data from the ART Pro-
     gram “Report Function” the first duty day of every month at 0900L. This does not relieve the unit of
     ensuring all postured UTCs have a current assessment at all times.

                                              Chapter 4

                                       AEF CERTIFICATION

4.1. General:
   4.1.1. AEF Certification is an Air Force process. It is a unit commander driven, UTC-based process
   that applies to all UTCs in the AEF Library that are tasked to deploy or placed on a Prepare To Deploy
   Order (PTDO). It assumes readiness of the pieces (UTCs) equates to readiness of the whole. The pro-
   cess begins with the unit commander assessing the ability of their UTCs to deploy and employ and
   culminates with COMACC, as the designated Air Force spokesperson, sending a certification mes-
   sage to Commander in Chief, U. S. Joint Forces Command (USCINCJFCOM). Each step in the pro-
   cess depends on the chain of command and an accurate assessment by commanders.
   4.1.2. AEF Certification has two objectives: To hold commanders at each level accountable for orga-
   nizing, training and equipping UTCs to provide required mission capability, and to inform CINCs on
   the status of deploying forces.
      4.1.2.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEM) Units will provide UTC certifications for all UTCs, includ-
      ing enablers, identified in AEF TPFDD Libraries in Deliberate Crisis Action Planning and Execu-
      tion Segments.
   4.1.3. Commanders will assess all UTCs postured in the AEF library, but will only certify the UTCs
   tasked to deploy for a steady state, contingency, and/or sourced in a PTDO for crisis response. Com-
   manders will certify UTCs for a specific AEF tasking, during a specific deployment eligibility win-
   dow. Due to the 120-day AEW cycle, AEF and AEW certifications will not coincide.
      4.1.3.1. Units which have received an AEF Deployment Requirements Manning Document
      (DRMD) or Deployment Order (DEPORD) are considered to be tasked-to-deploy forces. AEW
      and some AEF enabler UTCs do not normally deploy but are required to maintain a higher state of
      readiness in preparation for possible crisis response. When a CINC identifies specific required
      AEW and AEF enabler UTCs prior to crisis, those UTCs are placed on a PTDO for the duration of
      the AEF/AEW eligibility period.
   4.1.4. Commanders use the AEF UTC Reporting Tool (ART) to support the certification process.
   However, the ART assessment process is independent and separate from the certification process.
   ART reporting assesses the UTC’s capability to meet worldwide MISCAP mission today (stoplight-
   snap shot). AEF Certification assesses tasked-to-deploy UTC’s ability to meet theater requirements
   for an AEF eligibility period and identifies a process for communicating that assessment through the
   chain of command. Additionally, Certification assesses the ability of UTCs sourced in a PTDO to
   meet worldwide MISCAP mission at the beginning of an AEF eligibility period.
      4.1.4.1. In addition to ART, the unit commander should use the Commander’s Toolkit and Posi-
      tion Descriptions (located on the EAF Portal) to assist in the UTC assessment process. Com-
      mander’s Toolkit and Position Descriptions identify theater-specific training and track mobility
      requirements, which help prepare airmen for deployment.
   4.1.5. The intent of AEF Certification is to hold commanders accountable to provide UTCs that meet
   CINC requirements. UTCs and individuals who do not comply with theater reporting instructions and/
   or line remarks do not meet CINC requirements. Should a UTC or individual not meet requirements
   refer to Paragraph 4.2.7.
28                                  AFI10-244_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 30 MAY 2008


     4.1.6. AOR personnel processing discrepancy reports will be used by the AEF Center as feedback
     mechanism for certification. Moving AOR discrepancy reports from the personnel channels to the
     command channels will provide the supporting command feedback on the effectiveness of their certi-
     fication process.

4.2. Responsibilities
     4.2.1. Figure 4.1. is a wiring diagram of the AEF Certification process. The process uses the existing
     chain of command through the MAJCOMs. MAJCOMs include DRUs and FOAs. Both ANG and
     AFRC will certify their own forces as described in MAJCOMs responsibilities, paragraph 4.2.3. The
     diagram indicates the function of each command level and the relationship of the AEFC, COMACC
     and CINC in the certification process. The CORONA South 01 Decision 06 designated COMACC as
     the AF spokesperson for AEF Certification. As spokesperson, COMACC reports AEF readiness on
     behalf of all MAJCOM commanders and acts as the single point of contact to the joint commands.
     Also included are the certification tools (EAF Portal and ART)

Figure 4.1. AEF Certification Wiring Diagram.




     4.2.2. Commanders: Commanders should consider the following when certifying their tasked to
     deploy or PTDO UTCs:
        4.2.2.1. Does the UTC have all the resources and training needed to perform the duties tasked in
        the Mission Capabilities Statement (MISCAP)? Required resources are detailed in the MEFPAK
        (MANFOR and LOGFOR). UTC-specific training requirements include basic AFSC qualifica-
        tions, unit level certifications and worldwide mobility requirements including warrior skills train-
        ing. The EAF Portal contains specific details, source AFI requirements, and AOR details. Since
AFI10-244_USAFESUP_SSPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 30 MAY 2008                                                        29


     crisis tasking is unknown at certification, units that own PTDO UTCs report and certify on their
     ability to perform the MISCAP. Units will know if UTCs are on a PTDO by MAJCOM notifica-
     tion and through identification in JOPES PTDO plan identification number (PID).
     4.2.2.2. Is the UTC capable of successfully performing its combat mission at the tasked forward
     operating location (FOL)? Commanders should assess the UTC’s current ability to deploy and
     employ.
     4.2.2.3. Has the unit completed theater-specific training? Commanders can identify theater-spe-
     cific requirements/training by referring to the DRMD line remarks, AOR Reporting Instructions,
     EAF Portal Position Descriptions and Commander’s Tool Kit. UTC equipment requirements are
     identified in LOGMOD.
     4.2.2.4. The ART assessment process should not be confused with the AEF certification process.
     It is possible for a UTC to be red in ART and still be capable of performing the mission. Likewise
     a green UTC could be unable to perform the CINC tasking because of AOR line remark require-
     ments.
  4.2.3. MAJCOMs (including FOAs, DRUs, and ANG): MAJCOMs will develop internal processes
  for unit, wing, NAF and MAJCOM Commander’s certification. MAJCOM-level certification means
  the MAJCOMs have reviewed the chain of command ART assessments and their certification process
  inputs. The MAJCOM process must include a validation that certified UTCs are contained in the
  TPFDD. In other words, MAJCOMs must insure they are certifying all the tasked to deploy and
  PTDO forces for the particular eligibility period. Attachment 2 is a MAJCOM Commanders Certifi-
  cation Message template for AEF or AEW.
     4.2.3.1. MAJCOMs will transmit a MAJCOM Commander Certification Message to the AEF
     Center NLT 4 weeks prior to AEF/AEW deployment eligibility window. Send the messages via
     SIPRNET email to the AEFC commander at mailto: aefcenter@langley.af.smil.mil. Dates that
     fall on a weekend or holiday will be adjusted to the next duty day. This message documents the
     MAJCOMs certification of the UTCs tasked to deploy and on a PTDO as validated in the TPFDD.
     It formalizes the MAJCOMs review process and documents significant unit participation in prepa-
     ratory training events where applicable. Certification messages are classified depending on the
     message content IAW paragraph 3.1.
     4.2.3.2. MAJCOMs will ensure a system is set up to monitor, analyze and correct deployment dis-
     crepancies IAW AFI 10-215 to ensure personnel and equipment arrive in theater IAW all AOR
     component and AFI requirements. This feedback should be used to highlight unit deployment dis-
     crepancy trends and allow for corrective actions. MAJCOMs will inform the AEFC of potential
     deployment issues, and resolved problems.
  4.2.4. AEF Center (AEFC): The AEFC Readiness and Assessment Branch (AEFC/AEPR) will con-
  solidate MAJCOM Certification Messages and prepare a certification message for COMACC NLT 3
  weeks prior to AEF/AEW deployment eligibility window. Dates that fall on a weekend or holiday will
  be adjusted to the next duty day.
     4.2.4.1. The AEFC will analyze AOR personnel processing discrepancy reports. The analysis will
     be use to provide feedback to MAJCOM commanders on effectiveness of their certification pro-
     cess.

     4.2.5. COMACC: Commander, Air Combat Command (COMACC), is the AF designated representa-
     tive for AEF Certification and speaks on behalf of all MAJCOMs reporting to USCINCJFCOM the
     readiness of AEF UTCs tasked to deploy and on a PTDO. Attachment 3 is a template for COMACC’s
     AEF Certified Forces Message.
        4.2.5.1. COMACC will send an AEF Certified Forces Message to USCINCJFCOM NLT 2 weeks
        prior to AEF/AEW deployment eligibility window. Dates that fall on a weekend or holiday will be
        adjusted to the next duty day.
     4.2.6. AEW, Lead Wing and Lead Mobility Wing Commanders: Commanders should monitor ART
     to stay informed on the status of UTCS inside the AEF library.
     4.2.7. Theater Commander: Theater commanders and the AFFOR are the recipients of AEF capabili-
     ties.
        4.2.7.1. If a deployed commander discovers a UTC or individual deficiency, they should report
        through the AOR chain of command to the AF component. The AF component will notify the
        AEFC.
        4.2.7.2. The AEFC will capture the lessons learned and prepare a report detailing the deficiency
        and forward to the appropriate MAJCOM commander for resolution.
        4.2.7.3. The MAJCOMs will investigate the deficiency, and if required, take corrective action.
        The MAJCOMs will inform the AEF Center who will in turn inform the AFFOR of actions taken
        and complete the feedback loop.

Terms
AEF (Aerospace Expeditionary Force)—Wings, groups and squadrons assigned and attached to an
Aerospace Expeditionary Task Force or attached to an in place NAF by Department of the Air Force
(DAF) orders. (AFDD 1). A composite organization of aerospace capabilities from which a tailored
AETF, composed of Aerospace Expeditionary Wings (AEWs), Aerospace Expeditionary Groups (AEGs),
and Aerospace Expeditionary Squadrons (AESs), is created to provide forces to meet theater commander
in chief (CINC) requirements. An AEF is not a discrete warfighting unit.
AEF Library—A collection of 13 Time Phased Force Deployment Data sets (TPFDDs) in Joint
Operations Planning and Execution system (JOPES) that list the Air Force’s available Unit Type Codes
(UTCs) (UTC/UIC combinations) for a specific Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF), Aerospace
Expeditionary Wing (AEW), and Enabler Forces.
Aerospace Expeditionary Group—an independent group assigned or attached to an aerospace
expeditionary task force (AETF) or an in-place NAF by MAJCOM G-series orders. Normally, the an

aerospace expeditionary task force (AETF) or in-place NAF commander also exercises Operational
Control (OPCON) of AEGs. An AEG is composed of the group command element and one or more
squadrons. The AEG, depending on the size and structure of the AEF, is the lowest command echelon of
AEFs that may report directly to a COMAFFOR. Also called AEG.
Aerospace Expeditionary Task Force—A deployed numbered air force (NAF) or command echelon
immediately subordinate to a NAF provided as the US Air Force component command to a joint
operation. Also called AETF. See also air expeditionary force; air expeditionary wing.
Aerospace Expeditionary Wing—An Aerospace Expeditionary Wing (AEW) is a wing or a wing slice
assigned or attached to an Aerospace Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) or an in-place Numbered Air
Force (NAF) by MAJCOM G-series orders. Normally, the AETF or in-place NAF commander also
exercises Operational Control (OPCON) of AEWs. An AEW is composed of the wing command element
and some groups. The AEW commander reports to a Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR). Also
called AEW.
Alert Status—A posture, initiated by a Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Alert Order, in which
designated units prepare their personnel and equipment for rapid deployment upon receiving tasking.
Allocation—Distribution of limited resources among competing requirements for employment.
Resources Unit Type Codes (UTCs) made available to an AEF.
Apportion (Planning)—The resource made available to the commander of a unified command for
deliberate planning. Apportioned resources are used in the development of operations plans and may be
more or less than those allocated for execution planning or actual execution.
Available UTC—A Unit Type Code (UTC) tasked to a unit identification code (UIC) and registered in
the Air Force Wide UTC Availability System (AFWUS) as a UTC/UIC combination. When a unit has the
required personnel and equipment available, units may be tasked to provide multiple instances of the
same UTC combination. A unique record number in the AFWUS identifies the additional instances of the
UTC/UIC.
Command and Control—(DOD)—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. Command and
control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications,
facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling
forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission. Also called C2. (JP 1-02)
Deployment—The movement of forces within operational areas. The positioning of forces into a
formation for battle. The relocation of forces and materiel to desired operational areas. Deployment
encompasses all activities from origin or home station through destination, specifically including
intra-continental United States, intertheater and intratheater movement legs staging and holding areas.
See also deployment order; deployment planning; deployment preparation order. JP 1-02.
Deployed—These resources are not currently at home station by reason of execution of a properly
authorized movement order or Joint deployment order. Additionally, not recallable by a commander's
Leave and TDY recall message. Normally, deployment in support of training exercises or Joint exercises
would not preclude recall or release of forces by the exercising commander.
Direct Liaison Authorized—That authority granted by a commander (any level) to a subordinate to
directly consult or coordinate an action with a command or agency within or outside of the granting
command. Direct liaison authorized is more applicable to planning than operations and always carries
AFI10-244_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 30 MAY 2008                                                               35


with it the requirement of keeping the commander granting direct liaison authorized informed. Direct
liaison authorized is a coordination relationship, not an authority through which command may be
exercised. Also called DIRLAUTH (Joint Pub 1-02)
Designed Operational Capability—A summary of a units mission and resources for which it has been
organized, designed, and equipped used to aid in reporting in Status of Resources and Training Systems
(SORTS). Also called DOC (AFI 10-201).

sustain itself by creating a mindset and cultural state that embraces the unique characteristics of aerospace
power – range, speed, flexibility, precision – to meet the national security challenges of the 21st Century.
Expeditionary Combat Support—Tailored Agile Combat Support (ACS) capability deployed to
expeditionary sites to provide for Aerospace Expeditionary Forces (AEFs) employed in global
engagement operations. This capability is produced by rapidly deployable, tailored forces executing ACS
processes to beddown, employ, maintain, protect, and redeploy tactical components of aerospace power
and production.
Equipment—In logistics, all non-expendable items needed to outfit or equip an individual or
organization.
Equipment Condition—The status of an item of equipment in the possession of an operating unit that
indicates it is capable of fulfilling its intended mission and in a system configuration that offers a high

Functional Area Manager-—The individual responsible for the management and planning of all
personnel and equipment within a specific functional area to support wartime and peacetime
contingencies.
Force Module Package—A force module with a specific functional orientation (e.g. air superiority, close
air support, reconnaissance, ground defense) that include combat, associated combat support, and combat
service support forces. Additionally, for module packages will contain sustainment in accordance with
logistic policy contained in Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan Annex B. Also called FMP. See also force
module.
Force Package A—Force Package is the basic unit designator of a unit type code (UTC) and is used as a
planning tool to tailor an Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF).
Global Military force Policy—CJCS policy that determines Air Force ability to provide full distribution
of Command and Control (C2), Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and Combat Search
and Rescue (CSAR) assets. Also called GMFP
LD/HD (Low Density/High Demand)—Limited assets/forces with unique mission capabilities stressed
by continual high Operations TEMPO (OPTEMPO) because of Commander in Chief (CINC)
requirements. Often referred to as forces assigned to the Global Military Force Policy (GMFP).
Lead Unit—MAJCOMs will designate a lead unit when the forces placed on call come from more than
one location. The Lead Unit works closely with the parent MAJCOM who directs the planning and
coordination efforts of designated Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF) units to determine operational,
logistics, and support requirements to meet mission objectives.
Limiting Factor (DOD)—A factor or condition that, either temporarily or permanently impedes mission
accomplishment. Illustrative examples are transportation network deficiencies, lack of in-place facilities,

malpositioned forces or materiel, extreme climatic conditions, distance, transit or overflight rights,
political conditions, etc. (JP 1-02)
Logistics Detail—The specific material identified for deployment within the Unit Type Code (UTC).
Also called LOGDET
Logistic Force Packaging Subsystem—This MEFPAK component that contains Unit Type Code (UTC)
Logistics Detail (LOGDET) data and serves as a database for Operational Plan (OPLAN) development
and execution. Also called LOGFOR
Manpower Force Packaging System —The Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System
(MEFPAK) component that provides: The title of the unit or force element and its unique Joint Chiefs of
Staff unit type code. The manpower detail by function, grade (officers only), quantity and Air Force
specialty code required to meet the defined capability. Also called MANFOR.
Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System —A d a t a s y s t e m d e s i g n e d t o s u p p o r t
contingency and general war planning with predefined standardized manpower and equipment force
packages. MEFPAK, which operates in the command and control environment, is composed of two
subsystems: the Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) and the Logistics Force Packaging
System (LOGFOR). Also called MEFPAK
Mission Capability Statement—A short paragraph associated with each Unit Type Code (UTC) that
describes significant employment information, briefly explains mission capability, the types of bases to
which a UTC can be deployed, and all pertinent personnel substitution rules (i.e., bare base, standby
deployment base, or limited operating base). Also called MISCAP
Noncombatant Evacuation Operations—(DOD)—Operations directed by the Department of State, the
Department of Defense, or other appropriate authority whereby noncombatants are evacuated from
foreign countries when their lives are endangered by war, civil unrest, or natural disaster to safe havens or
to the United States. Also called NEOs. Also called NEO (JP 1-02)
On Call Status—A posture assumed by units designated by MAJCOMs allowing units to rapidly
transition from normal day-to-day operations to Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF) operations. This
posture is established before receipt of a Chairman Joint Chief of Staff (CJCS) Alert Order.
Personnel Reclama—When a wing/tasked unit/installation cannot meet an individual augmentee
tasking, they will request relief by submitting a personnel reclama through the local manpower and
military personnel flight to their parent MAJCOM personnel readiness office.
Positioning—Positioning refers to movements that take place after receipt of a Warning/Alert Order but
prior to the Execute Order. Positioning normally refers to aircraft, aircrews, and Mobility Support Teams
(MSTs).
Pre-Position—To place military units, equipment, or supplies at or near the point of planned use or at a
designated location to reduce reaction time, and to ensure timely support of a specific force during initial
phases of an operation. Exception: The HQ AMC Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) commander may
(pre) position air refueling forces (aircraft and crews) in anticipation of a Warning/Alert Order. Depending
on the nature of the contingency, this will facilitate the timely movement of other positioning/deploying
forces.
Rainbowed Equipment—Non-prepositioned equipment that is sourced from multiple units, left in place,
and utilized by multiple units/UTCs over time to enable the best support of vulnerable Aerospace
AFI10-244_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 30 MAY 2008                                                               37


Expeditionary Force (AEFs) while minimizing home station impact on supporting units (Equipment
working group, Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS) Conference).
Status—A stoplight Commander's assessment reporting the degree to which a Unit Type Code (UTC)
meets its designed capability.
Tasked to Deploy—The owing unit has received an order/directive to actually deploy the Unit Type
Code (UTC) in whole or in part (approximately 120 days out for steady state commitments). This is
different from a UTC being allocated to an Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF) or entering its primary
vulnerability period for deployment.
Time-phased force and deployment data—The Joint Operation Planning and Execution System
(JOPES) data base portion of an operation plan (OPLAN); it contains time-phased force data,
non-unit-related cargo and personnel data, and movement data for the operational plan, including: (a)
in-place units, (b) units to be deployed to support the operation plan with a priority indicating the desired
sequence for their arrival at the port of debarkation, (c) routing of forces to be deployed, (d) movement
data associated with deploying forces, (e) estimates of non-unit-related cargo and personnel movements
to be conducted concurrently with the deployment of forces, and (f) estimate of transportation
requirements that must be fulfilled by common-user lift resources as well as those requirements that can
be fulfilled by assigned or attached transportation resources. Also called TPFDD (JP 1-02)
UTC Shortfall—When a wing/tasked installation does not possess sufficient qualified personnel or
equipment to support a Unit Type Code (UTC) tasking, they request relief by submitting a UTC shortfall
request from the installation deployment office to their MAJCOM operation plans or deployment office.
For personnel, this request will be coordinated as a minimum with the local manpower office and MPF.
There are two types of personnel UTC shortfalls: 1) a wing/installation cannot support the entire UTC;
and 2) a wing/installation can support part of the tasked UTC, but cannot fill one or more of the Air Force
Specialty Codes (AFSC) requirements within the UTC.

                                     PROCEDURES OVERVIEW

A4.1. Using ART. ART is a web-based application that uses active server pages (.ASP). All inputs to the
web site are processed immediately and archived to a database resident at the AEFC. Users must be aware
all updates are "Real Time". All users must be appointed by their respective MAJCOMS prior to updating
the status of UTCs. MAJCOMs will forward all appointed users names in a format provided by the AEFC.
Upon receipt of user data the AEFC will pre-populate the ART database with this information to ensure
immediate access by authorized users. An online tutorial is provided upon initial login and users are
encouraged to review and understand the tutorial prior to establishing a user profile in ART. Review of the
tutorial will provide a better understanding of the procedures required to submit reports. Users should
review the on-line procedures contained on the AEF website for the latest updates to these procedures.
   A4.1.1. Reporting on a UTC.
       A4.1.1.1. Once appointed, users will create a user profile in ART. This profile can be edited and
       deleted at any time. MAJCOM's will notify the AEFC when user profiles are no longer valid or
       active. ART will generate a userid, the user will be required to provide a password. Upon verifica-
       tion users will be required to create a profile
           A4.1.1.1.1. Creating a user profile: once entered on the access list, the user must create a pro-
           file of the units that will be updated. Click on new user. After looking over the tutorial click
           next. Enter your first and last name and submit. A data base search will occur to ensure the
           submitted name is authorized to proceed. Your user information submitted by your MAJCOM
           will be displayed to ensure all data is correct and/or to make necessary changes. Changes
           should be sent via SIPRNET e-mail. There is no reference to Numbered Air Force (NAF) in
           the TPFDD library. To get this data into ART the system associates the NAF in the user’s pro-
           file with the UTC being updated. If a person enters an incorrect NAF or a UTC is not updated,
           the NAF selection will not locate all the UTCs for that NAF. A screen will display all bases
           units listed in the TPFDD library. Select the applicable base(s) (holding down the control key
           will allow selecting more than one base), and click submit. A screen will display and allow
           unit selection of one base at a time (holding down the control key will allow selecting more
           than one unit at a time. (Clicking the first unit and holding down the shift key and scrolling to
           the bottom then clicking on the last will select all). When all the appropriate units are selected,
           submit. Enter your password (Air Force standard: 8 characters, at least one upper case, one
           lower case, one special character and one number), submit. The final window will appear and
           display your userid/login. Please make sure to note the login.
       A4.1.1.2. Select base (if required), unit and AEF that will be updated. All UTCs for this combina-
       tion will display.
       A4.1.1.3. 30-day assessment: Select the appropriate status, i.e., Green, Red or Yellow. If reporting
       other then green, a detailed remark describing the deficiency is mandatory. Get-well-data is a man-
       datory field. If a get-well-date is not known provide your best estimate. If your UTC is "Green"
       you cannot submit remarks.

        A4.1.1.4. Tasked-to-deploy assessment. The tasked-to-deploy assessment is totally separate from
        the 30 day UTC assessment (green, yellow, red). The "UTC is Tasked to Deploy" selection
        defaults to "No".
            A4.1.1.4.1. Upon receipt of deployment notification (approximately 120 out days for steady
            state commitments) select "Yes". This will activate the "Can Meet Theater Specific Require-
            ments" selection.
            A4.1.1.4.2. "Can Meet Theater Specific Requirements." If the UTC can meet additional task-
            ing levied by the theater (such as specific training or line remarks) or there is no additional the-
            ater requirement click "Yes". If the UTC cannot support the tasking due to the theater specific
            requirement then check "No". The text box will activate and the discrepancy is entered (i.e. Do
            not have a 7 level with 14 years).
            A4.1.1.4.3. Upon return to home station/reconstitution check "No" under "UTC is Tasked to
            Deploy".
     A4.1.2. Generating a Report.
        A4.1.2.1. The "Reports" button on the ART Homepage gives access to the "UTC Reports Selec-
        tion".
        A4.1.2.2. The "UTC Reports Selection" is divided into two parts. The upper box controls what
        data is pulled and the lower box controls what is displayed.
            A4.1.2.2.1. You must select at least one area in each the upper and lower box.
        A4.1.2.3. You can display the data in one of three formats: a display to screen, an Excel spread-
        sheet, or a basic number count.
        A4.1.2.4. Note: A user profile is not required in order to access and generate a report.

    INTERIM CHANGE (IC) 05-1 TO AFI 10-244, REPORTING STATUS OF AEROSPACE
                           EXPEDITIONARY FORCES,
12 SEPTEMBER 2005
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates Interim Change (IC) 2005-1 and aligns this guidance with the results of the
Rapid Improvement Event to improve Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF) Reporting Tool (ART) data
fidelity and the reporting process. IC 2005-1 updates paragraphs, 1.5.2., 1.6.4.1., 2.7.3.1., 2.7.4.2., 3.3.,
3.4.7.4., 3.5., 3.7., and 3.8.1. IC 2005-1 also inserts paragraphs 2.4.1. and 2.6.3.1. This change requires
units to report a Unit Type Code’s (UTC) current and future ability to fulfill its Mission Capability State-
ment (MISCAP). Individuals are now required to report changes in their status to their supervisor, Unit
Deployment Manager, and unit commander. Each MAJCOM, FOA and DRU must assign ART Admin-
istrators in writing and units should assign ART OPRs to that position for 18 months. Individual training
not required by the UTC (MISCAP or manpower detail) will not affect the readiness assessment. Check-
lists will be used to assess the overall health of a UTC. All status remarks will be standardized remarks
from the Standard Assessment Remarks listing maintained within ART. Significant events that change
the assessment of a UTC are only required for the current plus two rotations. A bar ( | ) indicates a revi-
sion from the previous edition.
OPR: HQ USAF/XOOA (Major Hastings)
Certified by: HQ USAF/XOO (Maj Gen Teresa M. Peterson)
1.5.2. Provide units a mechanism to report a UTC’s current and future (6 months out) ability or inability
to fulfill its Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP) across the full ROMO, to include contingency and
rotational operations, and highlight associated deficiencies within the UTC.
1.6.4.1. Are AEF allocated UTCs able to accomplish their MISCAP defined mission if tasked today? If
tasked any time within the next six months?
2.4.1. Each MAJCOM, FOA and DRU will appoint an ART Administrator to manage the ART program.
Designation will include name(s), rank(s), organization, DSN telephone number, classified, and unclassi-
fied e-mail addresses. Provide appointment letter to the AEFC/AEPI or by e-mail to AEFC/Help-
Desk@langley.af.mil.
2.6.3.1. Report any change to their mobility status to their supervisor, UDM, and/or unit commander.
This also includes the responsibility to report any personal equipment shortfalls/deficiencies through the
next six months.
2.7.3.1. Designate wing level ART OPR by letter or e-mail as directed by MAJCOM, FOA , or DRU
guidance. Designation will include name(s), rank(s), organization, DSN telephone number, classified
e-mail and unclassified e-mail addresses.
2.7.4.2. Designate ART OPR in writing as directed by the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU. Include name(s),
rank(s), unit and DSN telephone number. Continuity and consistency in this position is critical and there-
fore should be for a minimum of 18 months.
3.3. What to Report. Commanders will report the unit’s current ability through the next six months to sup-
port each allocated UTC. NOTE: ART uses an extract of the approved UTC/UIC AEF assignment of
44                                  AFI10-244_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 30 MAY 2008


forces in the UTC Availability. A-UTCs are not currently reported in ART. ART is a source for AEF
UTC/UIC alignment for the unit commander.
3.4.7.4. The training assessment area indicates the status of training needed to support the mission for
which a UTC is designed (MISCAP). All personnel assigned to a UTC must have all required mission
and skill level training completed IAW applicable directives and instructions at the time of assessment.
Individual training not required by the UTC (MISCAP or manpower detail) will not affect the readiness
assessment but will be captured for deployment readiness tracking.
3.5. Assess the overall health of a UTC. The UTC represents a capability that is assessed using the cate-
gory areas described in paragraph 3.4.7. The overall assessment is rated using the following guidelines
and the ART Monitor Assessment checklist maintained within ART (ART Guidance under Information
Tab).
3.7. Remarks. Plain language supplemental remarks are a critical component of the ART report and are
used as a management tool. Remarks are required if a unit is less than fully capable in any reportable area.
Remarks are used to identify trends and to redirect resources if necessary. Remarks are mandatory for
UTCs assessed Yellow and Red. All status remarks will be standardized remarks from Standard Assess-
ment Remarks listing maintained within ART (ART Guidance under Information Tab) only. However, the
Commander’s Remarks section is an additional avenue that should be utilized to relay vital information
that affects the readiness or availability of the UTC. This area of ART can be utilized regardless of the
readiness status of the UTC (i.e., Green, Yellow, or Red).
3.8.1. Upon notification of a significant event that changes the assessment of a UTC for the current plus
two AEF rotations (i.e.: AEF 1/2 + AEF 3/4 & 5/6), the unit commander will submit an out-of-cycle
report within 24 hours of the change. This includes notification of a UTC change or addition.
