Section A—General Information

1. Preface. Air Mobility Command (AMC) will act as the single manager, on behalf of United
States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), for airlift, intertheater, intratheater, and
Continental US (CONUS) aeromedical evacuation, aerial refueling support, and support services
to the Department of Defense (DOD) Components as required by USTRANSCOM. AMC
operates its peace time operation for two reasons: (1) to continually exercise and train the
military and civilian manpower needed to ensure the United States meets contingencies around
the world and, if necessary, go to war; and (2) to provide economical air transportation to the
DOD. The image AMC projects to its DOD customers is influenced by the customer service its
passengers receive when traveling via AMC. Passenger Service Agents (PSAs) function as
AMC's ambassadors; they must meet the highest standards of dress and conduct. The service
AMC provides to DOD members and their families has a significant impact on their impression
of "quality of life" in the military service.
2. Passenger Operations.
   2.1. AMC passenger terminal activities shall provide a complete range of services to
   accommodate arriving/departing passengers and baggage. The terminal shall afford the
   passenger orderly and convenient progress from the ground side of the terminal to the aircraft
   and back. Depending on the size, physical layout, and personnel assigned, functions may be
   realigned/combined for operational efficiency. All DOD passengers Space-Required (Space-
   R) and/or Space-available (Space-A) shall be provided prompt, courteous, and professional
   service on an equitable basis.
   2.2. Personnel assigned to Passenger Service will review and be familiar with Attch 1,
   Glossary of References and Attch 7, Standards of Performance. These attachments will
   ensure success in providing the highest level of customer service.
   2.3. Customer Service Training: The AMC PSA Customer Service course is a HQ AMC
   initiated program designed to assist our PSAs in providing exceptional customer service to
   our passengers.
   2.4. The Customer Service Web Based Training (WBT) should be completed on or before
   assignment to the Passenger Service Flight. In all cases, the WBT should be completed prior
   to interaction with passengers. Refresher for the WBT will be completed annually.
   2.5. Interactive Customer Service Training. Each passenger terminal shall designate a class
   facilitator to guide students through a one-day facilitated/interactive customer service course
   designed by HQ AMC/A4TP. This course uses a short video, limited presentations, and role
   playing using AMC passenger terminal specific scenarios. The success of the course is
   heavily reliant upon student participation, discussion, comment, and interaction. The course
   is not intended and shall not be set-up for stand alone or self-paced use.
       2.5.1. The facilitator shall:
           2.5.1.1. Ensure the continued success of the class and provide this course locally to
           all military and civilian passenger agents.
           2.5.1.2. Establish a schedule that shall provide initial training within 3-6 months of
           assignment to passenger service. Refresher for the interactive customer training will
8                                                          AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


           be completed every 15-18 months. Local leadership may conduct refresher training
           sooner if needed.
           2.5.1.3. Be an E-5, civilian equivalent, or above.
           2.5.1.4. Maintain a class size not to exceed 20 students for each class. The facilitator
           may adjust the size of the class at his/her discretion to meet scheduling needs.
           However, it has been noted that the effectiveness of the training tends to decrease
           when the class size falls below 15 students.
           2.5.1.5. Ensure the following class materials (or equivalent) are in place prior to
           conducting training: HQ AMC/A4TP provided course materials, computer with
           PowerPoint and projector, screen, DVD capability, easel for flip charts, flip chart pad,
           markers (regular and dry erase) and masking tape.
           2.5.1.6. Use established course curriculum and material issued by HQ AMC/A4TP to
           ensure consistency throughout AMC. Request guidance from HQ AMC/A4TP before
           deviating from approved lesson plan.
           2.5.1.7. Maintain a roster with the completion date of each person assigned to the
           passenger terminal. For TSgt and below, completion shall also be annotated in G081
           or AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training.
           2.5.1.8. Strive for continuous improvement by soliciting feedback from students.
           Feedback/critique sheets should be forwarded to terminal leadership for their
           situational awareness and implementation, if appropriate. Forward feedback on
           course content to HQ AMC/A4TP.
    2.6. AMC Passenger Terminal Survey. All passenger terminals shall use the AMC
    Passenger Terminal Survey to measure customer satisfaction at their particular location. The
    template can be found on the HQ AMC/A4TP website (see Attch 8). The survey should be
    used as a local tool to demonstrate terminal effectiveness and assist with improving service
    as well as recognizing outstanding performers. Blank surveys shall be placed in conspicuous
    areas around the passenger terminal. A single collection box may be used for this survey and
    the AMC Form 253, Air Passenger Comments. Passenger terminals must ensure the
    Interactive Customer Evaluation (ICE) cards are made available to all customers. Units are
    required to respond to all inquires that request a reply within 3 duty days and must include
    actual response in ICE.
    2.7. Passenger Policy Update/Messages. Each AMC passenger terminal activity must ensure
    all agents review Passenger Policy Update messages monthly. These messages are also
    available on the HQ AMC/A4TP web site (see Attch 8).
    2.8. Passenger Processing Manual Procedures. Each AMC passenger terminal activity shall
    ensure manual procedures are developed and exercised. Manual procedures shall be used
    during "stressful environment" operations, i.e. power or computer outage. As a minimum,
    exercises shall be conducted on a quarterly basis and documented. When possible, exercises
    should be conducted in conjunction with wing/base exercises and during periods when it has
    the least impact on customer service. Note: In the event of automated data processing (ADP)
    or computer equipment failure during the manifesting process, initiate manual backup
    procedures to produce a manifest to accompany the aircraft. The backup system should be
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                   9


  capable of producing one of the following: offline manifest or DD Form 2131, Passenger
  Manifest. This manifest shall contain all required data IAW DOD 4500.9R, Defense Travel
  Regulation (DTR) Part I, Passenger Movement.
  2.9. AMC Form 76 (AMC Form 76A at Navy Passenger Terminals), Passenger Travel
  Information (AMC-GRAM). All passenger terminals/operations shall create a customized
  local AMC Form 76/76A using the template located on HQ/AMC A4TP website (see Attch
  8) as a guide. Terminals may create their own format but the information must be listed as
  stated on the template. This form contains standardized introductory information with space
  for each station to insert information most requested by travelers. The form will contain
  information on the cost, availability, location of billeting and transportation, a
  recommendation to differently abled passengers with non-apparent disabilities (such as
  hearing impairment, asthma, or pacemakers) to advise PSAs of this disability at the time of
  check-in, notification of the HQ AMC no-smoking/tobacco use policy on aircraft, and the
  form's revision date. Print a map of the base and major facilities and have them available in
  the same vicinity where the AMC GRAM is posted. Additional information can be added at
  the local commander's discretion to increase customer service and convenience.
     2.9.1. AMC Form 76/76A will be updated annually or whenever significant changes
     occur.
  2.10. Letter to the Passenger. Display the locally reproduced Fellow Traveler letter (Attch
  12) on an AMC letterhead or Squadron letterhead and signed by the following leaders in said
  categories. The guiding principle is to display the photo of the AMC Commander at the first
  level up from the passenger terminal.
     2.10.1. CONUS Aerial Port Squadron (APS) and Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS):
     Display APS/CC or LRS/CC with photo.
     2.10.2. Air Mobility Squadron (AMS): Display AMS/CC with photo.

     2.10.5. CONUS Navy-operated ports: Display installation Commander with photo.
  2.11. Passenger Service Identification Badges. To easily identify a PSA, each passenger
  agent and supervisor shall wear a passenger service badge below the nametag; a badge may
  be attached to the pocket with a clip-on device. The badge shall not be worn on the blue
  sweater. Commanders may authorize the wear of passenger service badges on the uniform of
  the day. Passenger service badges shall be worn only while on duty in or around the
  passenger terminal. Each badge is to be 3.5 inches wide, 2.5 inches high, and made of the
  standard nametag material. The agent's badges are blue, unless the agent is a shift supervisor,
  whereupon it is red. The passenger service officer also wears the red identification badge
  while on duty (reference AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force
  Personnel, AMC supplement). The blue badge reads: "AMC Passenger Service Agent," while
  the red badge reads: "AMC Passenger Service Supervisor." Civilian personnel may elect to
  have their name placed on the badge. If they elect to do so, the name will be placed directly
  above other lettering. When personnel transfer, badges shall be turned in during out-

  processing. Note: Due to the number of security badges required by the airport authority,
  AMC gateway personnel are exempt from this requirement.
  2.12. Privacy Act Statements (PAS). IAW AFI 33-332, passenger terminals shall display a
  PAS to notify passengers of the collection of personal information. Display on
  signs/monitors in areas where passengers routinely furnish personal information. PAS signs
  are locally developed and must include the authority, purpose, routine uses, and disclosure
  items. At OCONUS locations PAS signs should be in English and in the host nation's
  language.
     2.12.1. For Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES) locations the following
     information is provided and may be used verbatim to develop the PAS. For additional
     information refer to: http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/notices/usaf/F024AFAMCA.htm

     2.12.2. Authority: 10 USC. 8013, Secretary of the Air Force and E.O. 9397 (SSN).
     2.12.3. Purpose: Passenger Name Records are used to prepare aircraft manifests for
     passenger identification processing and movement on military aircraft, commercial
     contract (charter) aircraft, and on seats reserved (blocked) on regularly scheduled
     commercial aircraft at military and civilian airports. Records in this system are also used
     to develop billing data to the user Military Services or other organization, determine
     passenger movement trends, forecast future travel requirements, and identify, research,
     and resolve transportation related problems.
     2.12.4. Routine Uses: In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under 5 USC.
     552a(b) of the Privacy Act, these records or information contained therein may
     specifically be disclosed outside the DOD as a routine use pursuant to 5 USC. 552a (b)(3)
     as follows; to customs officials for the purpose of notifying foreign countries of
     personnel and equipment arrivals; records from the system are routinely disclosed to
     other Federal agencies and offices providing transportation, and to civilian airlines and
     airports for transportation services, developing billing data, manifesting passengers, and
     for forecasting future requirements. The 'Blanket Routine Uses published at the
     beginning of the Air Force's compilation of systems of records notices apply to this
     system.
     2.12.5. Disclosure: Voluntary. Non-disclosure of information shall prevent the
     processing and movement of the passenger.
     2.12.6. Public Address Systems. Each passenger terminal shall use a terminal
     announcement system to pass information to passengers (see Attch 19). When it is not in
     use, conservative recorded music or a reasonable facsimile may be connected to the
     system. Commercial gateway managers shall obtain the use of local airport public
     address system for announcements to our passengers.
  2.13. All passenger terminals shall maintain a website that meets the following minimum
  criteria:
     2.13.1. Accessible to customers inside the .mil/.gov domain.

       2.14.1. The ICE system is a web-based tool for collecting customer feedback about the
       services and goods provided by various organizations throughout the Department of
       Defense (DOD). ICE allows customers to submit online comment cards rating the quality
       of service provided by AMC Passenger Terminals.
       2.14.2. ICE Manager Duties. ICE managers are responsible for collecting passenger
       feedback and to provide tactful responses (positive and or negative) when responses are
       requested and/or necessary. Responses must be completed within 3 duty days. Actual

Section B—Passenger Service Center (PSC)

3. General. The PSC is typically the first point of contact with our customer. It is imperative
that individuals assigned to the PSC maintain a high level of customer service skills and a
positive attitude in carrying out their duties. NOTE: At AMC Gateway and Operating
Locations, the Passenger Service Center is referred to as the "Military Assistance Counter." This
counter includes Customer Service Branch (CSB) and other Service Liaison personnel, when
assigned.
4. Responsibilities.
   4.1. Seat Management. Handles all matters relating to seat management control which
   occurs after a mission is released to the terminal such as walk-ins, no-shows, late arrivals,
   rotated passengers, administrative holds, passport holds, etc. Arranges with the passenger
   check-in section to ensure information concerning available seats is promptly relayed to
   minimize workload surges and permit orderly processing of additional Space-R/Space-A
   passengers.
12                                                       AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


  4.2. IAW AMCI 24-101, Volume 9, firm seat releases must be provided to the passenger
  terminal no later than 5 hours prior to mission departure. The dispatcher or PSC agent will
  contact ATOC if seat release is not received within 5 hours of scheduled mission departure.
     4.2.1. Missions with short flight times of 2 hours or less may not meet this 5 hour
     timeframe. In those cases every attempt must be made to determine a firm seat release as
     early as possible.
  4.3. Passenger Eligibility. Determine passenger eligibility IAW DOD 4515.13-R, Air
  Transportation Eligibility and the Foreign Clearance Guide; maintain the Space-R and
  Space-A passenger registers, and determine the order of movement for both Space-R and
  Space-A passengers. Ensure passengers have appropriate border clearance documentation,
  when required.
  4.4. Reservations and Related Actions. Handle reservation and related actions within the
  passenger terminal after the pre-manifest is pulled and immediately preceding flight check-in.
  4.5. Coordination. PSC maintains close liaison with other terminal operation sections on
  matters relating to passenger reservation actions and pre-manifest listings. Coordinate
  directly with the contract representative and the passenger check-in section on all operational
  matters relating to the application and use of airlift capability.
  4.6. Flight setup at GATES/Non-GATES Stations. The PSC, flight controller, or dispatcher
  will accomplish the flight set up and review the pre-manifest, check for special category
  passenger codes, and pass requirements to the shift supervisor.
  4.7. Booking Control. The PSC has reservation/booking control for all scheduled passenger
  missions upon execution of the pre-manifest lockout (24 to 72 hours prior to mission
  departure) until the mission departs. During this time, the PSC can port book passengers,
  cancel reservations, accept late substitutions, increase/decrease group/family/troop seat
  blocks, and reduce/increase the allowable cabin load (ACL) as required, after coordinating
  with appropriate agencies, i.e. up-line/down-line stations and passenger processing. When
  adjusting the ACL, the actual ACL numbers shall be utilized. Entering an arbitrary number
  such as 999 is not acceptable. Note: Prior to pre-manifest lockout, 618 AOC (TACC)/XOGC
  will manage all ACL and pet allocation adjustments on passenger bookable missions.
     4.7.1. Port Booking Passengers. Passengers who arrive with orders/GATES itineraries
     for the flight(s) being processed but are not on the pre-manifest will be traced and
     verified in GATES before being port booked, when seats are available. All port booked
     passengers must be assigned a seat (no in-lap passengers authorized).
         4.7.1.1. When port booking passengers utilizing GATES, a Routing Indicator (RI)
         must be placed in the appropriate block. Routing indicators are used to properly
         identify the location a passenger was booked (e.g. RMSTERM=Ramstein Passenger
         Terminal).
         4.7.1.2. 618 AOC(TACC)/XOGC shall create and maintain the RI Files. File
         information will include the following: Administrative Addresses, E-mail Addresses,
         and Defense Switch Network (DSN)/commercial telephone numbers. To update

AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                     13


  4.8. Pre-manifest. At GATES stations, the PSC shall lock and download the pre-manifest 24
  hours prior to scheduled mission departure but no earlier than 72 hours. The PSC must
  prepare pre-manifests for Patriot Express (PE) missions and forward sufficient copies to
  information control/dispatch not later than (NLT) 10 hours prior to scheduled aircraft
  departure. At Non-GATES stations, the Data Processing Center (DPC) shall forward the pre-
  manifest to the PSC upon request or no later than 24 hours prior to scheduled mission
  departure.
  4.9. Opportune Airlift. The PSC will initiate action to process passengers for seats that
  become available on opportune airlift.
     4.9.1. Manifesting of Passengers. On channel missions, with prior coordination of the
     down line station, passengers may be manifested past stations where minor mission
     number changes occur. Minor mission number changes include a change in the basic
     mission number (i.e. outbound to inbound 0671 to 0672), suffix, or Julian date.
         4.9.1.1. Passengers may not be manifested past locations where the basic mission
         number changes completely (i.e., 06E1 to 06R5).
         4.9.1.2. Passengers may not be manifested round trip.
         4.9.1.3. Passengers shall not be manifested on the positioning legs past stations
         where the mission becomes active without approval from the down line station. For
         Special Assignment Airlift Mission) SAAM, exercise, or contingency missions,
         coordinate with the down line stations to ensure the requirements of Para 4.9.2. have
         been met.
     4.9.2. Unused Seats on DOD-Owned or Controlled Airlift (includes SAAM,
     Aeromedical Evacuation, Exercise and Contingency). IAW DOD policy, all unused
     seats on DOD-owned or controlled airlift will be released for use by Space-R and Space-
     A passengers. On all mission types, the senior AMC or terminal representative, in
     coordination with the aircraft commander and the user as applicable, will determine if a
     defined need for security, or if overriding safety or legal concerns (including hazardous
     cargo, customs, agriculture or citizenship and immigration service consideration)
     prohibits Space-A travelers from flying on a specific mission. The aircraft commander is
     the final authority responsible for all matters affecting the operation of their aircraft. This
     authority is to be exercised judiciously within the context of DOD Space-A policy stated
     in Para 10.2. Situations where the above prohibitions restrict Space-A travelers from a
     particular mission should be the rare exception rather than the rule.
     4.9.3. The servicing air terminal or designated manifesting agency will manifest Space-A
     travelers or other opportune traffic. If the location has no air terminal or AMC
     representative, then the aircrew must ensure proper manifesting, border clearance,
     security, and passenger/baggage screening requirements are completed.
     4.9.4. The AMC ATOC at the air terminal of origin will ensure passenger(s) can be
     received at destination, meet(s) border clearance requirements, and must not hamper
     user's mission departure/arrival operations. If the aircraft/mission is not landing at an
     AMC operated passenger terminal, passengers must be briefed by the PSA that there may
     be little or no passenger support at their destination (i.e., no terminal, easily available
     telephone, transportation, or billets). They must understand that the aircrew is not
14                                                       AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


     responsible/capable to provide these services and that they must deal with these
     limitations within their own capabilities.
     4.9.5. Displacing Revenue Cargo and Passengers. Displacing Space-R cargo and/or mail
     for emergency leave/duty passengers on cargo or dual configured missions may be
     authorized by the Transportation Representative (TR), Aerial Port Ops Officer, or Air
     Terminal Manager (ATM) on a case-by-case basis when timely movement cannot be
     provided on passenger missions. To ensure command visibility of excessive Space-R
     passenger backlog, notify 618 AOC (TACC)/XOGX whenever cargo is displaced for
     passengers.
  4.10. Rotating Passengers.
     4.10.1. Duty passengers are not normally rotated to accommodate other duty passengers
     except when necessary to move Priority One passengers whose movement cannot be
     guaranteed within 24 hours. All known available airlift must be considered including
     government arranged commercial seats. If movement cannot be guaranteed begin rotation
     procedures. Unless there are severe mitigating circumstances, do not remove any pre-
     manifested passengers who already received their boarding passes. Prior to removing
     Space-R passengers, the PSC will try to get volunteers to remove themselves from a
     flight. Space-A travelers may be removed at any station for duty passengers, patients, or
     cargo. Note: Only as a last resort will Category I, Space-A passengers be removed from a
     flight at the originating location. Do not rotate Category I passengers at en route stations.
         4.10.1.1. If no one volunteers or rotation of Space-R passengers is still needed, begin
         removing passengers in the following order:
            4.10.1.1.1. Selected Space-R Duty Standby passengers (line numbers 700-799)
            4.10.1.1.2. Port Booked passengers (line numbers 0600-0699)
            4.10.1.1.3. Overbooked passengers (line numbers 0500-0599)
            4.10.1.1.4. Prebooked passengers (line numbers 0001-0499) meeting the
            following criteria: unaccompanied Permanent Change of Station (PCS) military
            passengers (E-6 and below); the last to check-in is the first to be removed.
            4.10.1.1.5. Non-GATES stations will record the time of check-in on the pre-
            manifest to facilitate rotating passengers if necessary.
         4.10.1.2. The following passengers may not be rotated: funded emergency leave,
         family groups, members separating, prisoners, prisoner escorts, passengers pending
         boarding actions, passengers on retirement orders, foreign nationals, and reservists.
         Note: In instances where available seats remain, but either the total aircraft ACL or
         available baggage stowage space has been reached, the processing of the flight should
         be discontinued. Passenger Services will advise ATOC which will in-turn advise
         618AOC/XOGX of the situation. PSAs should monitor these conditions especially
         during mobility, exercises and contingencies when excess baggage is authorized for
         deployment.
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                  15


5. Patriot Express (PE) and Category M Flights Show-times/Check-in Times.
   5.1. The HQ AMC Standard show time/roll call for Space Required passengers is no later
   than two (2) hours and 20 minutes prior to aircraft scheduled departure. Space-available roll
   call standard is no earlier than two (2) hours and 20 minutes prior to aircraft scheduled
   departure.
       5.1.1. If deemed necessary for unique situations (peak travel periods, multiple departures
       within a short time period) the TR, Aerial Port Ops Officer, or ATM may adjust
       show/roll call times as needed.
       5.1.2. Requests for long term/permanent deviations to Para 5.1 greater than 90 days in a
       12 month period shall be submitted by the respective Unit Commander to HQ
       AMC/A4TP.
   5.2. Check-in for pre-manifested passengers must be made available 6 hours prior to aircraft
   departure but may begin as early as 24 hours prior to aircraft departure at the discretion of
   TR, Aerial Port Ops Officer, or ATM.
       5.2.1. IAW AFI 36-3003 Para. 4.11.13., the PSC will notify the servicing MPS and HQ
       AFPC/DPWCM within 72 hours after members miss a port call.
6. Space-R (Duty Standby) Passengers. Space-R passengers without a reservation shall be
considered duty standby. Sign-up must be accomplished in person by the traveler or group leader
if traveling in a group. However, the PSC may port book passengers when excess seats are
available in lieu of placing the passengers on the duty stand by register. All Space-R duty
standby passengers shall be assigned a seat (no in-lap passengers authorized). Remote sign up is
not authorized for duty stand by passengers.
   6.1. Space-R Standby Processing. GATES stations shall cancel any conflicting reservations
   to preclude duplicate bookings.
       6.1.1. Collect two copies of travel orders and sign-up passenger(s) in GATES. Provide
       passenger information on the next flight and show time. Annotate date/time of arrival,
       travel priority, type travel code and dependent information (when applicable) on both
       copies of orders. Return one travel order to the passenger for their record. File station
       copy according to travel priority and date/time of sign-up.
       6.1.2. At Non-GATES stations, collect two copies of the orders and record travel priority
       and type travel code, dependent information, and date/time of sign up in the "remarks
       section" on both copies. Provide passenger information on the next flight and show time.
       Enter the passenger(s) information on the manual Space-R backlog. Manual backlog will
       contain passenger name(s), rank, travel priority, destination and date/time of sign-up.
       File station copy according to travel priority and date/time of sign-up.
       6.1.3. For Temporary Additional Duty (TAD)/Temporary Duty (TDY) port booked
       passengers, mail one copy to the appropriate Defense Finance Accounting Service
       (DFAS) as identified in DTR Part I.
       6.1.4. Sign-up intransit Space-R standby passenger(s) IAW Para 6.1.1 or 6.1.2 as
       applicable.
16                                                       AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


     6.1.5. To travel aboard AMC owned/controlled missions, a travel order or a letter of
     authorization citing the authority for travel and billing instructions and/or fund cite and
     associated CIC is required. Letters of Authorization (LOA) shall be used for travel on
     AMC organic or commercial charters. LOA(s) shall include the contract number,
     commanding officer's name directing the movement, phone number, unit mailing address,
     billing address with point of contact and phone number or a CIC from the contractors T-
     account. LOAs must be signed by the contracting officer or their designated
     representative. Travel documentation must identify where the authorized travel is from
     and to. All forms of travel documentation must identify where the authorized travel is
     from and to and the time period of travel authorized.
     6.1.6. The PSC shall provide a means for Space-R standby passengers to verify their
     position in the backlog. This may be accomplished by printing a register from GATES or
     displaying the register on a computer monitor accessible by the passengers. Create the
     register by channel, and make it available for passenger viewing. When there are no
     passengers in the backlog, printing the register is not necessary.
  6.2. Space-R Reimbursable Travel. IAW DOD 4515.13-R, certain categories of eligible
  Space-A travelers may elect to pay for a seat at the applicable Department of Defense
  Channel Passenger Tariffs or Other Non-DOD Channel Passenger Tariffs (Attch 8) to secure
  a reservation as a Space-R passenger. This decision and transaction must be made prior to the
  mission opening. However, they may not change their status for movement on a mission
  currently being processed. When passengers change their travel status from Space-A to
  Space-R, they shall keep their relative place in the respective category, that is, from Space-A
  emergency leave to Space-R emergency leave. When the computer system is down for more
  than 24 hours, Space-R standby register will be maintained manually.
  6.3. TWCF/Non-TWCF Documentation. All Space-R and Space-A passengers transported
  via TWCF or non-TWCF aircraft over AMC or non-AMC channels must be documented and
  reported as TWCF. EXCEPTION: Navy operated AMC Terminals are still required to
  separate TWCF and Non-TWCF passengers. Passengers from the terminal back-log, airlifted
  on an AMC SAM or Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM) are shown as TWCF
  traffic.
     6.3.1. For Space-R passengers with a CIC, enter the CIC in the appropriate block.
     6.3.2. Passenger CICs. CICs are the basis for billing passenger travel and identifying the
     service responsible for payment. Travel authorization for reimbursable space required
     passenger transportation must cite the chargeable appropriation and CIC approved by the
     funds certifying official or the full billing address with point of contact and phone/fax
     numbers for reimbursement on a Special Account Handling (SAH) basis. Otherwise,
     provide payment by indicating cash collection.
     6.3.3. CIC General Guidance. The aerial port/air terminal is not responsible for
     construction of the CIC. Instead, aerial port/air terminal personnel should follow special
     account handling procedures as outlined in AMCI 24-101 Volume 6, Transportation
     documentation, Data Records and Reports. Refer to CIC guidance at
     https://www.amcfm.scott.af.mil/CIC_Generator.htm or contact HQ AMC/FM at
     Defense Switch Network (DSN) 779-2668 for CIC assistance.
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                   17


   6.4. Special Account Handling (SAH) Procedures. Refer to AMCI 24-101Volume 6.
      6.4.1. In the event a passenger arrives at the Passenger Terminal with a letter of
      authorization signed by commanding officer citing the authority for travel, fund cite/CIC
      or billing address, and unit Point of Contact (POC) vice published orders due to the
      urgent nature of travel, the letter of authorization must be included in the manifest
      package received from passenger processing. Forward one legible copy to HQ
      AMC/FMFAB, 402 Scott Dr Unit 1K1, Scott AFB IL 62225-5311. Note: This type of
      movement is only authorized for emergency situations and is not authorized or intended
      to replace valid orders.
      6.4.2. In some circumstances, passengers will travel using non-billable CICs. Port
      commanders must ensure these codes are not misused. Non-billable CICs are specifically
      coded to not produce a bill and are as follows:
          6.4.2.1. SAAM/Contingency operations where the dedicated mission was originated
          specifically for the purpose of transporting specific passengers will utilize non-
          billable CICs. The Data Records section will ensure that the correct CICs are used.
          Refer to Table 1 to create the correct non-billable CIC for the applicable branch of
          service of the traveler. Any airlift capability available for use to move cargo and
          passengers (along AMC channel routes) on an opportune basis, after planned mission
          requirements have been met, will be processed and billed as normal revenue
          generating passenger, cargo, and mail. A billable Transportation Account Code
          (TAC) or CIC must be entered or SAH, cash collection procedures should be
          followed.

Table 1. Contingency Operation CICs (non-billable).
                        Air Force       FSAM00000000000
                        Army            ASAM00000000000
                        Navy            NSAM00000000000
                        Marines         MSAM00000000000
             6.4.2.1.1. Short take-off and landing missions. A CIC was created for these Air
             Combat Command (ACC) commercial contract missions supporting MILGRP in
             Colombia. These missions are non-billable; utilize CIC "STOL00000000000" for
             space required passengers on these missions.
          6.4.2.2. Thru-load/Intransit manifesting. If a passenger's travel is terminated en route
          due to mission cancellation and the passenger was originally manifested to end
          destination, ensure that an "E" has been entered in the second position of the CIC
          field in GATES for forward movement to original destination. Do not permit "E" to
          be used instead of "A" when CICs are not available, nor is it to be used if the
          passenger voluntarily changes transportation routing.
          6.4.2.3. Missions transporting cargo and passengers that originate and terminate
          within the Continental United States (CONUS) do not generate revenue for TWCF.
          However, the tracking and billing systems require accounting information in order to
          process cargo and passenger movements. In this case utilize "CTC000000000000" for
 18                                                       AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


          the CIC and the original TAC for cargo. Since DCBS strips this data, no bill is
          created for shipper within CONUS movement.
          6.4.2.4. AMC Mobility Mission Observer (MMO). Passengers designated as AMC
          MMO have been invited by HQ AMC/CC to accompany AMC aircrew on AMC
          organic military aircraft. Use of "4MMO00000000000" is only authorized on AMC
          organic military aircraft. Refer to Para 25.1 for more information.
          6.4.2.5. Defense Courier Service personnel may travel under                  the   CIC
          "DCSC00000000000" on commercially contracted cargo missions.
          6.4.2.6. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) may travel under the CIC
          "MEP00000000000" when approved by competent authority. Refer to Para 25.4 for
          more information. Mission Route Support (MRS) may travel under a CIC created in
          accordance with Attch 4, Mission Route Support CIC Chart. Refer to Para 25.2 for
          more information.
          6.4.2.7. USAF Academy cadets traveling to/from overseas sponsoring agencies
          aboard KC-10 aircraft will have the statement: "For travel aboard KC-10 aircraft
          only, CIC: "4AFACADET000000" in the remarks section of their orders. Cadets
          traveling on any other aircraft will require a travel order. Cite the CIC and funding in
          Block 19 to include SAH procedures. Refer to Para 25.3 for more information.
          6.4.2.8. Cash payment. If a cash payment is made ensure that a "C", “L”, or “J”,
          based on the appropriate tariff rate as identified in AMCI 24-10, Volume 6 has been
          entered into the second position of the CIC field in GATES.
          6.4.2.9. Reserve component forces authorized in DOD 4515.13-R, to travel on DOD
          controlled aircraft for reserve inactive duty training can be eligible to use a non-
          billable CIC, see Para 25.7
          6.4.2.10. For Space-A passengers enter an "H" in the second position of the CIC
          block followed by the date and time of sign-up. Example: H0311345.
          6.4.2.11. Special Account Handling (SAH) Codes. Refer to AMCI 24-101 Vol 6 for
          Data Records requirements.
7. Operational Support Aircraft (OSA).
   7.1. Passengers on OSA missions shall only be manifested in GATES if they process
   through the passenger terminal. In these instances, use the CIC OSA000000000000. For
   passengers taking advantage of an open seat on an OSA mission but are not associated with
   the mission, PSAs should enter the billable CIC from the orders. If passengers go directly to
   the aircraft, the aircrew is responsible for manually producing a manifest using DD Form
   2131, Passenger Manifest. This manifest shall be submitted to either Base Ops or the
   passenger terminal and attached to the mission folder. There is no requirement to manifest
   OSA missions in GATES for the purpose of ITV.
   7.2. Passengers who are on an advance list provided by an airlift validator need only present
   their ID card and orders for verification of duty status (these orders are not retained by
   passenger service). Telephone reservations from an airlift validator shall be accepted by the
   PSC.
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                       19


   7.3. Duty Stand-by Passengers selected for opportune movement shall be processed IAW
   Para 6. above.
   7.4. Passengers processed by the AMC Passenger Terminal shall be manifested in GATES.
8. Questionable Travel/Erroneously Manifested Passengers.
   8.1. All PSAs must ensure requirements of DOD 4515.13-R are met with regard to
   passenger travel eligibility. When an order or authorization for movement of passengers is
   neither authorized by DOD 4515.13-R nor approved according to its procedures,
   transportation shall be denied. When the passenger's orders appear to be erroneously
   published, and time and circumstances warrant, en route locations should contact their
   respective Wing and CONUS locations should contact HQ AMC/A4TP (DSN 779-4593) to
   resolve the problem. En route locations should contact HQ AMC/A4TP after attempts to
   contact the Wing have failed or the issue is time critical. Passengers traveling on
   questionable orders shall be informed of the fact and advised their travel documents shall be
   forwarded to higher headquarters for possible billing. The station making the determination
   shall document the case and forward it to HQ AMC/A4TP, 402 Scott Dr. Unit 2A2, Scott
   AFB IL 62225-5308 who shall forward it to the Service Headquarters for necessary action.
   Questionable travel cases should be forwarded with all accompanying documents (orders,
   statements, and passenger's permanent home of record address). The Services shall make the
   final determination to bill the passenger or the orders issuing agency.
   8.2. Movement of Erroneously Manifested Passengers. If passengers are erroneously
   manifested and a resolution cannot be reached at local level, a Passenger Terminal
   Supervisor will contact HQ AMC/A4TP for movement consideration (Ref DOD 4515.13-R,
   Para C1.3.2.). If passengers are already in the AMC system when an error is discovered,
   onward transportation to the final destination shall be denied. They shall be offered
   transportation as follows:
      8.2.1. Passenger information shall be collected and held in a standby status. Passenger
      shall be moved on the first available flight with open seats after all other passengers for
      the flight have been processed as follows (waiver authority rests with HQ AMC/A4TP):
      CONUS-OCONUS, OCONUS-OCONUS, OCONUS-CONUS; return to originating
      country. CONUS-CONUS; return to originating station. If the passenger(s) decline the
      first available seat(s), they shall forfeit the right for return travel. If the passenger elects
      to continue to their erroneously manifested destination via commercial means, AMC shall
      not be responsible for returning them to their originating station.
      8.2.2. Terminal management shall document all such instances and forward them to HQ
      AMC/A4TP, 402 Scott Drive, Unit 2A2, Scott AFB IL 62225-5308, with info copies to
      point of origin and all en route stations.
9. Remote Space-A Registration.
   9.1. Remote Space-A signup may be accomplished in one of four ways: fax, email, internet
   and mail. All passenger terminals shall accept remote sign-up via email (this does not apply
   to Space-R standby duty passengers).
      9.1.1. When utilizing remote sign-up the passenger is required to identify their station of
      assignment (the local area where their leave officially starts/ends) or state/country of
20                                                       AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


     residence on the request. This is to ensure PSA’s have the information necessary to adjust
     date/time of sign-up in regards to time zone differences.
     9.1.2. Documentation for fax, mail and email. At the Aerial Port of Embarkation
     (APOE) a copy of the applicable service leave form and AMC Form 140, Space-
     available Travel Request, shall be utilized. If AMC Form 140 is not available a statement
     including name/s (sponsor and all dependents), rank, social security number/s (sponsor
     and all dependents), number of seats required, and a list of five desired country (Attch 7)
     destinations. However, they must declare their final destination at check-in.
     9.1.3. Passenger Terminals are not authorized to recommend/advertise any third party
     Space-A sign-up service (example: it is not authorized to place a link for a
     commercial/civilian Space-A website on a passenger terminals website and/or AMC
     Gram, or to verbally recommend passenger sign-up via such a site).
  9.2. The lack of a passenger's social security number shall not preclude remote sign-up.
     9.2.1. Upon receipt of a request that does not contain a Social Security Number (SSN) at
     GATES locations, PSAs shall sign up the passenger using a pseudo person ID consisting
     of the prefix RMT, the first four letters of the passenger's last name, first and middle
     name initials. (Example: Cobb, Jeffrey, Walter (RMTCOBBJW). Note: If a person does
     not have four letters in their last name or a middle initial the number zero "0" shall
     substitute in the character blocks (Example: Ray, Colin, Allen (RMTRAY0CA). If
     signing up additional dependents, utilize numbers in place of the middle initial for the last
     character for each dependent (Example: RMTRAY0C1).
     9.2.2. When passengers physically present themselves at the PSC/check-in counter,
     PSAs must ensure the entry of the actual SSN through the "Change Person ID" activity in
     the "Space-A/Space-R Sign Up" or "Passenger Check-in" windows.
     9.2.3. If the passenger does not have a SSN (i.e. infants) use the passport ID number.
     9.2.4. If the passenger ID card does not show a SSN, the PSA must solicit it from the
     passenger.
  9.3. Basis for date/time of sign-up.
     9.3.1. Fax. The fax header data shall establish date/time of sign-up.
     9.3.2. Email. The email header data shall establish date/time of sign-up.
     9.3.3. Mail. The date and time received at the PSC counter shall establish date/time of
     sign up.
     9.3.4. Internet. The system shall determine date/time of sign-up.
     9.3.5. Time zones must be taken into account to ensure passengers are given full
     entitlement of date/time of signup.
         9.3.5.1. When a remote signup is received that GATES precludes entry due to time
         zone difference, local policies must be established that ensure input reflecting the
         passengers original date/time of sign-up.
  9.4. Active duty members on pass may utilize remote sign-up by indicating desired
  destination, name, rank, and inclusive dates of pass.
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                      21


   9.5. Active members of Reserve Components (actively participating with a reserve unit) may
   only register for travel to/from eligible destinations IAW DOD 4515.13-R.
      9.5.1. DD Form 1853, Travel Eligibility, Verification of Reserve Status, shall be stamped
      with the current date upon receipt.
          9.5.2.1. Activated reservists shall have the appropriate service leave form.
10. Space-A Registration.
   10.1. General. Unused seats aboard DOD-owned or controlled aircraft shall be offered to
   anyone meeting the provisions of DOD 4515.13-R. Space-A passenger movement cannot be
   provided until provisions have been made for the movement of all revenue cargo, mail and/or
   passengers (reference AMCI 24-101, Volume 9, Air Terminal Operations Center).
   10.2. Governing Regulations. DOD 4515.13-R, establishes movement priorities for Space-A
   travel.
   10.3. Space-A registration may be done in person at the passenger terminal by using AMC
   Form 140, or by using any of the remote sign up procedures as listed in Para 9. Sponsors may
   register their family members. Those who do not have travel documents, such as passports or
   ID cards (required for dependents 10 years of age and older) for family members, may
   register for travel; however, PSC personnel shall brief the traveler that travel will be denied if
   documents are not available at time of check-in. Passengers who use AMC form 140 for
   travel registration should retain the passenger copy as proof of registration. Note:
   Destination “All” is no longer an option when signing up for Space-A.
   10.4. Married Members. Married service members may register as a family group provided
   both active duty members are on leave status at the time of sign-up. If they have differing
   leave expiration dates, sign them up under the earliest expiration date.
   10.5. Groups. All group members (excluding families) desiring Space-A travel must register
   individually. Sport team/group leaders or coaches have no authority to act on behalf of other
   team members for Space-A registration.
   10.6. Stamp the passenger's leave authorization/documentation with your local sign-up
   stamp (see Attch 9) or a GATES produced printout with passenger sign-up information.
   10.7. Space-A Register. The PSC shall provide a means for Space-A passengers to verify
   their position in the backlog. This will be accomplished by printing a register from GATES
   or displaying the register on a computer monitor accessible by the passengers. When there
   are no passengers in the backlog, printing the register is not necessary. When the computer
   system is down for more than 24 hours, Space-A register will be manually maintained. This
   will be accomplished by using the existing register and adding newly registered passengers.
   If no register exists, a manual register must be generated and maintained.
   10.8. Ineligible Passengers. Individuals are placed on the ineligible list based on their
   conduct or behavior. These individuals have been identified by their respective Service
   Headquarters to be ineligible to travel on DOD-owned and controlled aircraft and barred
   from worldwide Space-A travel.
      10.8.1. Instances of unacceptable passenger conduct or behavior that warrant
      consideration for removal of Space-A privileges shall be forwarded to HQ AMC/A4TP.
 22                                                        AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


      Include all supporting documentation (travel documents, PSA statements, police reports,
      etc.). HQ AMC/A4TP shall review all reports and forward to the appropriate Service
      Headquarters with HQ AMC/A4TP recommendation. Decisions on passenger
      ineligibility rests with the passenger's respective Service Headquarters.
      10.8.2. Space-A Ineligible List/Local Hold List: When passengers are identified as
      "Ineligible" in GATES, the passenger agents must cross check the worldwide/local
      ineligible list containing the names, SSN, and other pertinent information to validate
      ineligibility before denying travel. For local hold list, written requests shall be provided
      to terminal management for inclusion and/or removal from the listing through various
      sources such as, local commanders, legal offices, or security forces. Both lists must be
      easily accessible at all times and agents should be thoroughly trained on their use and
      procedures to take when an ineligible passenger attempts to travel.
      10.8.3. Specific questions from passengers relating to their eligibility must be directed in
      writing to their Service Headquarters. Provide them their Service Headquarters address as
      follows:
          10.8.3.1. Navy: NOLSC, 1837 Morris Street, Norfolk, VA. 23511.

          Washington DC 20380-1775.
11. Space-A Rules.
   11.1. Space-A Calls. Passengers may choose not to meet all Space-A calls for flights going
   to their desired destination and they shall not be removed from the Space-A Register. Flag
   officer passengers are selected by their travel category and date/time of sign up but may be
   offered the option of making the Space-A call with all other passengers or doing so by a
   personal representative.
   11.2. Duration on the List. Prospective passengers shall be removed from the Space-A
   Register after remaining on the list for 60 days or when the travel authorization expires,
   whichever occurs first. Passengers removed from the register shall be allowed to sign up
   again with a new date/time of sign-up. Once a passenger departs a station their record shall
   be purged at that particular station. They shall need a new date/time of sign up prior to future
   travel from that location.
   11.3. Pass. Active duty military may travel on a pass but may only remain on the Space-A
   register for the duration of the pass. Dependents may accompany their sponsors.
      11.3.1. Service members may travel using their military ID card and verbal word they
      are on pass. If the passenger subsequently presents leave orders that are valid for the day
      of sign up, during or after the pass period they must sign up again with a new date and
      time.
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                     23


   11.4. Seat Refusal. Prospective passengers may refuse a seat on any aircraft after receiving
   the “Unique Mission Briefing” (see Para 16). Passengers shall not lose their place on the
   Space-A register for refusing the seat.
   11.5. Expired Leave Orders. Active Duty military members whose leave orders have expired
   shall be allowed to remain on the Space-A register if they are attempting to have leave
   extended. These personnel should not be moved until their leave is extended, but if there are
   extenuating circumstances, the passenger service officer/detachment commander/NCOIC
   may elect to authorize movement. Leave extensions shall be accepted based on verbal
   confirmation of the passenger. If declared AWOL, report them to the security forces/airport
   police.
   11.6. Sign-up Time. Greenwich Mean Time (Zulu)/date of sign-up must be used at all
   passenger processing locations.
   11.7. Passengers shall receive a new date/time of sign-up when changing travel categories
   (i.e. Category III to Category II). Passengers will not be penalized when changing their
   destination.
   11.8. Passengers shall retain their original date/time of sign-up from the point of origin to the
   final destination, provided they are continuing to geographically move to their declared final
   destination. Ensure the passenger's final destination is annotated on the boarding pass.
   11.9. Travel Ready. All passengers are required to be travel ready at start of roll call. To be
   considered travel ready, passengers must have all required documentation, checked baggage
   and accompanying family members/group members present. If a passenger is not ready to
   travel for any reason, refer the traveler to the appropriate agency and provide directions. If at
   all possible, give the passenger a name of someone who can help. As a minimum provide an
   appropriate telephone number.
12. Space-A Roll Call.
   12.1. General. Space-A roll calls will be IAW Para 5.1 (see Para 5.1.1 for exception). Roll
   call is a phrase used to signify the beginning of the process in which eligible passengers in
   each category are selected by date and time of sign-up. This shall enable passengers to plan
   their activities and ensure equitable opportunities for all. All Space-A passengers shall be
   assigned a seat (no in-lap passengers authorized). Requests for deviation from the established
   roll call time shall be submitted to HQ AMC/A4TP for consideration.
   12.2. All Space-A passengers competing for a seat must be marked present (passengers may
   be marked present for 24 hours) at the beginning of roll call. Those passengers not marked
   present must wait until all other Space-A passengers marked present at the beginning of the
   roll call have been afforded the opportunity to compete for open seats. If seats remain when
   the roll call is complete, begin a new roll call starting with Category I. Note: During the
   mark present process, and prior to marking a passenger present, PSA will ensure all
   applicable/required information is populated in GATES. (i.e., EPC, INS, etc.).
      12.2.1. PSAs will make an announcement prior to each roll call, reminding passengers to
      mark themselves present and to ensure they are travel ready before attending roll call. See
      Para A19.2.8.
 24                                                         AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


   12.3. PSAs will provide an introductory briefing to passengers at the beginning of the Space-
   A roll call. This briefing shall provide: the rank/name of the PSA conducting the call,
   mission number, flight destination(s), and that passengers will be selected by category and
   date/time sign up. Perform the unique mission briefing, if applicable (see Para 16).
   12.4. A verification of travel documentation will be conducted for Space-A passengers at
   mark present.
   12.5. Space-A passengers shall not be removed for other Space-A passengers.
   12.6. Category I, Space-A passengers shall be considered for any flight currently being
   processed even if the Space-A roll call has already begun (roll call start time passed)
   regardless of the current category being selected.
   12.7. If anytime during the Space-A roll call, Space-R walk-in travelers present themselves
   to the PSC counter and seats are available, they must be given a seat ahead of any Space-A
   category (1-6) traveler(s). However, they shall not be processed before any duty passenger on
   the Space-R waiting list that is present for the flight.
   12.8. If a mission changes destination(s) during the roll call, the roll call must be started
   over.
       12.8.1. When additional seats are released for a mission, the Space-A call shall continue
       where it previously ended. However, if you had to pass over a family due to insufficient
       seat release, and additional seats become available later, afford the families that were
       passed over an opportunity to take these seats first and then resume the Space-A roll call
       selections where they previously ended.
   12.9. Upgrade. Space-A passengers may be upgraded IAW DOD 4515.13-R, C6.1.7.3. to the
   bottom of Category I for travel under emergency conditions (unfunded) or extreme
   humanitarian reasons when the traveler's situation is validated by a competent and formal
   authority such as American Red Cross notification, unit commander's memo, doctor's letter,
   or by some other similar means. Emergency upgrade period for initial departure should
   generally be limited to one week. Passengers shall maintain the origin station upgrade until
   they reach their specified destination; however, this upgrade is not applicable for return
   transportation. Passengers shall return to original authorized category of travel for return trip.
   Note: Category I “upgrades” should not be confused with Category I Space-available travel.
   Passengers traveling under Category I Space-A travel may be entitled to round trip travel as
   Category I. Reference DOD 4515.13-R Table C6.T1. for specific entitlement.
       12.9.1. IAW DOD 4515.13-R, upgrade authority is held by the installation commander
       and may be delegated no lower than the chief of the passenger service center or its
       equivalent (OIC/Supt of Passenger Service). A current copy of the Space-A upgrade
       delegation letter must be maintained at the passenger terminal.
13. Space-A Passenger Removal. When necessary to remove Space-A passengers at en route
stations to accommodate Space-R passenger/cargo, the order of selection for removal shall begin
with the lowest category passenger with the latest date/time of sign-up as reflected on the
manifest. If removed passengers elect to continue travel to their specified destination, they shall
be entered into the Space-A backlog using their original date/time of sign-up. When necessary to
remove Space-A passengers at the originating station, the order of selection for removal shall
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                  25


begin with the lowest category passenger with the latest date/time of sign-up as reflected on the
manifest. EXCEPTION: Passengers who were selected on a subsequent roll call IAW Para
12.8.1 shall be removed first. Note: Thru load Space-A passengers shall not be removed for
Space-A passengers originating at subsequent en route locations.
   13.1. Gate no-shows shall be reentered on the Space-A register with a new date/time of
   signup unless the reason for missing the flight was beyond the passenger's reasonable
   control; e.g., sickness, automobile accident, etc.
   13.2. GATES stations can use the "ROTATE PASSENGER" tab/command to assist in the
   selection.
   13.3. The shift supervisor or assistant shift supervisor shall be consulted prior to removing
   any passenger and shall personally verify that the correct people are removed from the flight.
14. Federal Inspection Fees.
   14.1. Head Tax. IAW public law, transportation tax (head tax) must be assessed for Space-A
   passengers traveling on all commercial aircraft missions. The head tax applies to all Space-A
   passengers who arrive/depart the Customs Territories of the United States (CTUS) to/from
   overseas locations on these missions. Refer to HQ AMC/A4TP message guidance for current
   rates.
   14.2. A Federal Inspection Service (FIS) fee applies for Space-A passengers traveling to the

 26                                                         AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


should be briefed of the nature of these missions and afforded the opportunity to remove
themselves from the flight. Passengers shall retain their position in the Space-R/Space-A
backlog if they elect not to travel on specific missions. Note: A locally produced Video/DVD
may be used in lieu of a brief. If used, it must contain all of the items listed above.
17. Non-AMC Destinations. If a mission is operating to a non-AMC destination, passengers
must be briefed that there may be little or no passenger support at their destination (i.e., no
terminal, easily available telephone, transportation, or billets). They must understand if they take
these flights, they must deal with these limitations within their own capabilities. If they do not
wish to take these flights, they shall maintain their original date and time of sign-up.
18. Acceptance of Minors (PE missions).
   18.1. General. Non-spouse minors less than 18 years old as of the date of travel shall NOT
   be accepted for unaccompanied Space-A travel (see Para 18.4 and note). Non-spouse minors
   between the ages of 8 and 17 years as of date of travel shall be accepted for unaccompanied
   Space-R travel if:
       18.1.1. They are brought to the airport by a parent, guardian, or responsible adult who
       shall remain with the minor until departure and evidence is presented by such parent,
       guardian or responsible adult that the minor shall be met at the airport of arrival by
       another parent, guardian, or responsible adult. The adult shall provide documentation
       bearing the name, address, and telephone number of the adult who shall meet the minor at
       the destination and the adult who is entering the minor into AMC's custody. This
       information should be given to the senior AMC representative. Have the parent or
       guardian fill out AMC Form 1004, Unaccompanied Minor Passenger. This form should
       be reproduced in triplicate (1 copy to the senior flight attendant, one copy to the minor,
       and one copy should be retained on station with the mission paperwork).
       18.1.2. The flight on which space is held is not expected to terminate short of, or bypass
       destination.
       18.1.3. The minor shall not be permitted to stop over en route.
       18.1.4. For unaccompanied minors with a connecting commercial flight arriving from
       OCONUS military airfields: AMC shall take custody of the minor upon arrival at the
       AMC Gateway and shall deliver the minor to the commercial counter.
       18.1.5. For unaccompanied minors arriving via a commercial airline and departing an

      18.2.1. In the event a mission is delayed for 24 hours AMC personnel will contact the
      CTO or utilize the contact information on the AMC Form 1004 for notification purposes.
      The Detachment Chief/Passenger Terminal Supervisor or their designee will be
      responsible for the unaccompanied minor until mission departure.
   18.3. Space-A travel eligibility cannot be delegated or transferred except for dual Uniformed
   Services members. The source of eligibility is the sponsor. Powers of Attorney do not create
   legal guardianship, therefore, travel under a power of attorney, non-court ordered adoptive
   guardianship, etc. is not authorized. Powers of Attorney may not be used to move sports
   teams, school children, boy/girl scouts, youth groups, friends, etc., under adult leaders/figures
   in a Space-A status. Unaccompanied minors shall not be entered into the Space-A Register.
      18.3.1. Certain dual Uniformed Services member parents/step-parents may accompany
      their dependent children regardless of which parent is designated as the sponsor in the

      19.3.4. Establish emergency surge operating procedures for onward movement of
      passengers by commercial means.
20. Information Control/Release.
   20.1. Releasing Flight Information. In order to balance between the needs of the customer
   for flight information and the need to safeguard information for OPSEC and force protection,
   the following applies:
      20.1.1. At GATES locations, passenger terminals will use the GATES FIDS software.
      Any local conditions/information displayed will be at the discretion of the local unit
      commander, but must be displayed on a monitor separate from flight information
      monitor.
      20.1.2. At GATES locations, when GATES FIDS is inoperable, a trouble ticket must be
      submitted to the GATES help desk. A locally designed presentation will be displayed in
      the interim. The locally designed presentation must display the same information as
      GATES FIDS.
      20.1.3. Non-GATES locations will use a locally designed presentation or flight status

       21.1.1. Command Sponsored Dependent Travel Program. The intent of this program is to
       afford command sponsored dependents relief from their overseas duty location.
           21.1.1.1. Travel is authorized Overseas-CONUS, CONUS-Overseas and Overseas-
           Overseas. Once a dependent lands in the CONUS, their onward travel is complete
           unless they are manifested on an aircraft that is only transiting the en route CONUS
           location or transiting a CONUS location is required, i.e. EDF-HIK with fuel stop at
           SUU.
           21.1.1.2. The sponsor must obtain documentation (letter) verifying command
           sponsorship from their current unit commander. Each letter is valid for one round trip
           from the sponsor's overseas PCS duty location; however, as long as they are moving
           towards their declared destination they should be allowed to transit other locations.

        There is no limit on the number of letters a commander may issue. Dependents must
        present a copy to the servicing air passenger terminal, and shall retain a copy in their
        possession during travel. If passengers have not used their letter or completed their
        Space-A travel within ninety (90) days from the date of issuance, a new letter is
        required from the sponsor's commander.
        21.1.1.3. PSAs should only accept letters signed by unit commanders, designated

        command sponsored travel.
     21.1.2. Non-Command Sponsored Dependent Travel Program. The intent of this
     program is to visit the sponsor's unaccompanied overseas duty location, not to
     rendezvous at another location.
        21.1.2.1. Travel is authorized to the sponsor's unaccompanied permanent PCS
        location. Travel under this program is not authorized when the sponsor is on
        TDY/TAD orders.
           21.1.2.1.1. Travel is authorized Overseas-CONUS, CONUS-Overseas, and

        dependents name(s) and current residence information, length of authorized stay, and
        time frame the approval letter is valid. Passengers shall be removed from the Space-A
        Register on expiration date of the approved time period stated in the letter or after 60
        days, whichever comes first. If passengers have not completed their travel within 90
        days from the date of issuance, a new letter is required. Each letter is valid for one
        round trip to the sponsor's overseas PCS duty location; however, as long as they are
        moving towards their declared destination they should be allowed to transit other
        locations. There is no limit on the number of letters a commander may issue.

     from each passenger for all DOD missions. The sole purpose for this information is to
     ensure timely notification to the EPC in the event of an unfortunate circumstance. It does
     not designate beneficiaries and should not be confused with Next of Kin (NOK)
     information. Request name and phone number of an emergency contact not traveling
     with the passenger. This is DOD policy and the information is required to be solicited by
     public law. If a passenger does not want to list a personal emergency contact, they have
     the option of listing their First Sergeant as their emergency point of contact. In the event
     a passenger refuses to provide emergency contact information, a manifest entry reflecting
     the fact shall be made. If emergency contact information is already resident in GATES,
     PSAs must confirm the information with the passenger at check-in. (Automatically
     marking the passenger as having declined is unacceptable) Note: The only two
     authorized EPC entries are 1) actual contact information or 2) "declined" if the passenger
     declines to provide information.
         22.5.1.1. GATES locations shall use the Emergency Point of Contact data field to
         meet this requirement. Non-GATES/manual locations shall use DD Form 2131 to
         collect the required data. Preferably prior to departure, but not-later-than 60 minutes
         after aircraft departure, the completed spreadsheet must be transmitted to HQ AMC
         via e-mail to passenger.manifest@scott.af.mil, or if e-mail is unavailable, call DSN
         779-4593 for fax capability. If using e-mail, include the mission number, departure
         date/time, aircraft type and tail number in the subject line. This spreadsheet shall be
         maintained in the flight package at the originating station.
     22.5.2. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Data. CBP requires advance notification
     of all passengers departing the United States and arriving from overseas with an ultimate
     destination in the Customs Territory of the United States (CTUS, the fifty United States,
     District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico) on all DOD missions.
         22.5.2.1. PSAs shall collect the date of birth, country of residence, passenger's
         nationality, document number, document type, gender, and passport country of
         issuance from appropriate passengers.
            22.5.2.1.1. For active duty military members use document type code "M". For
            civilians and retired military members use document type code "P".
         22.5.2.2. File one copy of the INS report in the mission flight package.
         22.5.2.3. Non-GATES/manual locations annotate a copy of the manual manifest with
         the appropriate data. Provide one copy in the mission flight package. Within one hour
         of mission departure the manual manifest with annotated INS data shall be scanned
         and emailed to apis.military@dhs.gov.
  22.6. Determine Distinguished Visitor (DV) requirement/request and pass to flight
  controller/dispatcher who informs ATOC.
  22.7. Groups. The group leader/Team Chief may check-in all members, provided all
  required travel documentation, body weights and weight of all hand carried items are
  available.
  22.8. Customer Identification Code (CIC). Check travel orders for fiscal data, CIC, and
  signature block. At GATES stations, ensure the data on the GATES check-in screen face is
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                  37


  the same as the travel order. If different, change the data on the screen to match the travel
  order.
  22.9. Weights. Standard planning weights should not be used for passengers transported on
  AMC Owned/Controlled aircraft. Each traveler should be asked for their weight. Do not
  automatically use ID card weights. Standard planning weights are only authorized on DOD
  organic aircraft during contingencies or wartime situations where time does not allow for
  obtaining actual weights. When transporting troops, actual scaled weights of individuals (in
  full uniform) and all hand-carried items shall be used when possible. If scales are not
  available, ask each individual their weight and use the additive item weights listed in the
  DTR, Part III.
     22.9.1. When transporting passengers other than troops, on organic aircraft, interrogated
     body weights plus hand carried baggage weight, shall be used to determine actual body
     weights. Discretion and tact must be used when requesting body weights. Note: For DOD
     commercial charter aircraft, use actual/interrogated weights under all conditions. The use
     of standard weights is not authorized. All hand-carried baggage must be weighed. At
     GATES locations add the hand-carried baggage weight to the passenger body weight.
     When utilizing the DD Form 2131, weights are annotated in the hand-carried baggage
     block.
     22.9.2. PSAs shall place the passenger's line number (i.e., line #100, 1 of 2, 2 of 2, etc.)
     on baggage tags to expedite the location and possible removal of baggage in the event of
     a gate no-show.
  22.10. Brief each passenger that the use of tobacco products is prohibited aboard all AMC-
  owned or controlled aircraft.
  22.11. Meals. Offer meals in accordance with Section F Para 48, In-flight Meal Schedule
  and collect money for those sold.
     22.11.1. Annotate AMC Form 148 series, AMC Boarding Pass/Ticket/Receipt, in the
     space provided for meals purchased, i.e., kind/type/quantity and meal cost. The following
     applies:
     22.11.2. When a passenger is authorized to receive a government meal at no charge and
     orders a meal, annotate the boarding pass with words "no charge" in the meal cost block.
     22.11.3. When there are other cash transactions and no meals are ordered, enter the
     notation "no meal" in the meal purchase block and a zero in the meal cost block.
     22.11.4. Make the above entries by pen and ink or by stamp at Non-GATES stations.
     22.11.5. En route stations shall issue a new AMC Form 148 series for meals provided at
     that station.
  22.12. Passengers shall be informed that in-flight meals shall be served only on presentation
  of the boarding pass, with record of meals purchased. Brief passenger's refunds for meals not
  received are made only on presentation of a boarding pass signed by the loadmaster/boom
  operator at the next arrival location.
  22.13. At Non-GATES stations, the flight controller shall use the AF Form 79, Head Count
  Record, to record meals sold. When meal orders are called in annotate the number and kind
38                                                       AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


  of meal in the block corresponding with the passenger's line number. If the meal is at no cost
  to the passenger, place the letters N/C in this block.
  22.14. Seat Assignment Policy. One of AMC's goals is to transport our customers in the
  most professional way possible and make the trip a positive experience. A key stepping stone
  toward achieving this goal is for a passenger to receive the seat they desire. At GATES
  locations, on commercial contracted aircraft, a seat map shall be assigned at the originating
  location and must be used throughout the entire mission route. On organic missions use of
  seat maps is optional. En route locations should contact the originating station for adjustment
  to the assigned seat map.
     22.14.1. All passengers regardless of age, traveling on AMC owned or operated airlift
     will have an assigned seat.
     22.14.2. When the aircraft is configured with business or first class seats, give priority to
     special category (Wounded passengers upon request, Medal of Honor holders, Blue
     Barks, Coin Assist, Next Of Kin of Very Seriously Ill, and O-6 or civilian equivalent and
     above) passengers. The first two rows on commercial PE aircraft (without business or
     first class seating) are to be used for DV seating to the maximum extent possible. Any
     remaining seats shall be on a first-come, first-served basis.
     22.14.3. Seating In Emergency Exits. Passengers seated in emergency exit rows must
     have sufficient mobility, strength, or dexterity in both arms, hands, and legs to reach
     upward, sideways, and downward to open the emergency exit and exit slide-operating
     mechanisms. For C-5 aircraft refer to AMC Form 103, C-5 Seating Chart. They must be
     able to grasp, push, shove, pull, or otherwise open emergency exits; to remove
     obstructions similar in size and weight; to exit expeditiously; stabilize escape slides; and
     assist others in getting off an escape slide.
         22.14.3.1. Passengers must be 15 years of age or older and capable of performing the
         above functions.
         22.14.3.2. Passengers must be able to read and understand English language
         instructions.
         22.14.3.3. Passengers must have sufficient visual capacity to perform the above
         functions.
         22.14.3.4. Passengers must have sufficient aural capacity to hear and understand
         instructions.
         22.14.3.5. Passengers must not have any condition that might cause the passenger
         harm if he or she performs the above functions.
  22.15. AMC Boarding Pass. The PSA shall record the appropriate information on the
  boarding pass at Non-GATES stations. The passenger's line number goes in the top left-hand
  corner after the word "AMC" on AMC boarding passes. Spell out the final destination in the
  specified destination block on the appropriate AMC Form 148 Series, AMC Boarding
  Pass/Ticket/Receipt.
     22.15.1. Passenger agents shall use the boarding pass as a visual aid when briefing the
     passenger on the departure time and boarding gate number. The baggage claim stubs
     must be attached to the boarding pass.
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                 39


       22.15.2. The flight controller shall keep a running total of passenger body and baggage
       weights and total meal orders by type on the manifest. Pass this information (along with
       the boarding manifests) to dispatch.
   22.16. Dispatch shall pass the final passenger and baggage weight to COR or ATOC, as
   applicable, and give aircraft copies of the manifest to the gate agent. Note: Ensure an
   adequate number of manifest copies are prepared to meet the needs of all subsequent
   locations and any additional copies required by their local border clearance agencies.
   22.17. Passenger Totals. Dispatch shall advise ATOC on the total number of Space-A and
   Space-R passengers, special category passenger information, and total number passengers off
   next station. Use AMC Form 79, Passenger Information Envelope (Attch 5), to help provide
   information to the loadmaster/boom operator or flight attendant. At GATES stations, give the
   "CLOSE OUT STATUS REPORT" to ATOC as soon as possible after flight closeout.
23. Connecting/Remain Over Night (RON)/Delayed Passengers. These passengers shall be
documented by annotating the station file copy of the passenger manifest with the following
statement. "Passengers on this manifest were counted/recounted as originating and terminating
for the following reasons: RON/Delayed/Connecting." The stamped copy of the manifest is
forwarded to ATOC for inclusion in AMC Form 77, Aircraft Ground Handling Record. Do not
document these passengers on AMC Form 108, Passenger Rehandled Workload, for these
reasons.
   23.1. A passenger is considered RON if:
       23.1.1. Passengers are on a thru load manifest on a mission which RONs.
          23.1.1.1. Baggage is offloaded and returned to the passenger.
          23.1.1.2. Pre-departure check-in (or any action requiring the passenger to check-in at
          the processing counter the following day) is required.
          23.1.1.3. Baggage is collected, retagged, and loaded.
   23.2. A passenger is considered delayed if:
       23.2.1. Manifested on a mission that is delayed for an extended period of time.
       23.2.2. Baggage is offloaded and returned to the passenger.
       23.2.3. Pre-departure check-in (or any action requiring the passenger to check-in at the
       processing counter the following day) is required.
       23.2.4. Baggage is collected, retagged, and loaded.
   23.3. A passenger is considered connecting if:
       23.3.1. They are pre-manifested on a connecting mission.
       23.3.2. Boarding passes are reissued.
       23.3.3. Baggage is returned to the passenger or segregated on arrival and added to the
       appropriate originating baggage pallet/bin.
   23.4. If passengers are re-screened, re-transported, re-manifested, and re-boarded, the
   passenger dispatch section shall complete AMC Form 108 to reflect the additional workload
 40                                                     AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


   (refer to AMCI 24-101, Volume 6, Transportation Documentation, Data Records, and
   Reports for additional information).
24. Special Category/Unique Passenger Processing Procedures and Policy.
   24.1. Special Category Passengers.
      24.1.1. Stowaway. A stowaway is an unauthorized person aboard an aircraft not listed on
      the flight manifest. Ask for security forces assistance at the aircraft to remove the
      suspected stowaway, if necessary. Contact immigration and customs inspectors, if
      applicable. When returning a stowaway, passenger service dispatch shall notify ATOC
      for inclusion in the Mission Load Report.
      24.1.2. Deportees. Passengers transported via/on an AMC mission who fail to meet
      border clearance requirements and are refused entry must be returned to the nearest
      station where the passenger may secure proper border clearance documents. Return air
      transportation shall comply with the time limitation established by the country refusing
      entry plus any additional requirements made through/with the host country. Notify ATOC
      for inclusion in the Mission Load Report.
      24.1.3. Distinguished Visitor (DV). These passengers are senior officers (O-6 or civilian
      equivalent and above) or senior public officials. Passenger service officers shall ensure
      needs and desires of these passengers are met. When mission requirements permit,
      provide DVs the option to board/deplane aircraft before or after other passengers.
      Dispatch shall pass to ATOC DV codes and any requests of the DV (see Attch 2 for the
      Glossary of Codes). This information shall be included in the Mission Load Report.
      Note: CWO5s/CW-5s and E-9s traveling with DVs as part of the their official party will
      be identified at time of check-in and be afforded the same privileges as the principal on
      AMC controlled missions.
      24.1.4. Blue Bark. Active duty members or US citizen employees of the DOD and/or
      their dependents traveling in conjunction with the death of the member, civilian
      employee, or dependents of the above when returning to the CONUS. Passengers
      presenting themselves at the counter as a "Blue Bark" passenger(s) shall be personally
      assisted by the passenger service supervisor and afforded all privileges associated with
      DV assistance. Dispatch shall pass any down line requests to the ATOC for inclusion in
      the Mission Load Report. If there are no requests, so state in the Mission Load Report.
      Passenger service boarding agents shall brief the loadmaster/boom operator/flight
      attendant when boarding Blue Bark passengers. Upon mission arrival Blue Bark
      passengers shall be met at the aircraft by a passenger service supervisor to ensure all
      arrangements are satisfactory. Blue Bark passengers shall not be removed/rotated at
      originating/en route stations to accommodate Space-R or Space-A passengers.
      24.1.5. The same services provided "Blue Bark" passengers shall be offered to a person
      escorting human remains and shall be assisted personally by a passenger service
      supervisor.
      24.1.6. Coin Assist. These passengers are dependents whose sponsors are missing in
      action, prisoners of war, or as otherwise designated by the DOD. The same services
      provided "Blue Bark" passengers shall be offered to “Coin Assist” and shall be assisted
      personally by a passenger service supervisor.
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                  41


     24.1.7. Medal of Honor Recipients. These passengers shall be personally assisted by the
     passenger service shift supervisor and afforded all privileges associated with DV
     assistance. Travelers shall present a copy of the Medal of Honor award certificate as
     directed in DOD 4515.13-R Chapter 6.
     24.1.8. Next of Kin of Very Seriously Ill. These passengers shall be personally assisted
     by a passenger service supervisor and afforded all privileges associated with DV
     assistance.
  24.2. Unique Passengers.
     24.2.1. Differently Abled Passengers. The normal process for determining travel
     acceptance shall be followed, along with an evaluation of required assistance for the
     differently able passenger. ATOC/COR shall coordinate with the aircrew to ensure
     aircraft configuration provides proper access and safe transport of differently abled
     passengers. AMC aircrew shall make every effort to accommodate them. Differently
     abled passenger assistance depends largely on the degree of mobility and type of aircraft
     (e.g., If a differently abled passenger is selected for a C-5 mission and the passenger can,
     with assistance, negotiate the internal stairs, he/she can travel). Once determined as
     acceptable, the passenger terminal shall advise the ATOC/COR when a passenger with
     special needs (e.g., wheel-chair bound) is likely to be selected for a flight. On the rare
     occasion when operational or equipment limitations preclude serving differently abled
     passengers, passenger terminal personnel must ensure the passenger understands why air
     transport is not possible on the mission in question (see AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift
     Operations, for additional information).
        24.2.1.1. Decisions regarding acceptance of a differently abled passenger for a flight
        shall be determined no lower than the shift supervisor with final determination made
        by the aircraft commander.
        24.2.1.2. Differently abled passengers should be boarded early, preferably in seats
        close to latrine facilities if so desired, and be assisted in boarding by passenger
        terminal and aircrew personnel. Ensure adequate assistance is provided to assure
        safety during all differently able passenger movement operations.
     24.2.2. Movement of Large-Bodied Passengers (passengers who cannot be safely
     restrained in a single aircraft seat using a single seatbelt). Handle these passengers IAW
     Para 24.2.1. There shall be times when these passengers cannot be accepted for flight
     aboard AMC aircraft due to flight safety considerations. AMC Commercial Contract
     aircraft or KC-10 aircraft equipped with airline seats are authorized to use seat belt
     extensions to accommodate these passengers. Transport of these passengers may also be
     possible on other organic aircraft only if they are equipped with sidewall seats, utilizing
     only the standard aircraft seat belt restraints as they are designed to carry fully equipped
     paratroopers. For all other organic aircraft, seat belt extensions or cargo straps shall not
     be used.
     24.2.3. Prisoners and Guards. Movement of prisoners with unarmed guards and prisoners
     traveling on their own recognizance can be moved on government arranged commercial
     seats. Prisoners requiring armed guards are moved only on organic missions, and shall be
     seated before any other passengers are onloaded. On arrival, all passengers shall be
 42                                                      AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


      downloaded before the prisoner and guards. When briefed that aircraft shall be carrying
      prisoners and armed guards passengers may choose to decline seats, without penalty.
      Information control/dispatch shall notify ATOC when prisoners are manifested aboard
      AMC flights to allow ATOC to notify down line stations in the departure message.
      ATOCs at down line stations shall notify dispatch of these prisoners, and ATOC shall
      also inform the security forces. Prisoners traveling under their own recognizance or those
      accompanied by unarmed escorts require no special loading procedures.
      24.2.4. Eastern Test Range/Ascension and Antigua. Space-A passenger movement IAW
      DOD 4515.13-R to/from African countries transiting the Eastern Test Range is restricted
      to those personnel permanently assigned to African countries. For flight plans, Patrick
      AFB passenger terminal administers all space allocations. To protect US treaty
      obligations, Space-Available travel to the Eastern Test Range is done on a space
      allocation basis for Antigua Air Station and requires approval and confirmation from the
      Commander, Ascension Auxiliary Field, that overnight facilities are available before
      traveling through Ascension.
      24.2.5. Movement of Pregnant and Postpartum Mothers and Newborn Infants shall be
      IAW DOD 4515.13-R.
          24.2.5.1. Infants and Infant/Car Seats Aboard Aircraft. Infant car seats are not
          mandatory for travel aboard AMC flights. Utilization should be strongly encouraged.
          When utilized, car seats shall be IAW Para 68.8.5.
25. Passengers with a Unique CIC (MMO, MRS, MEP, Cadet, and Couriers).
   25.1. AMC Mobility Mission Observer (MMO). Passengers designated as AMC MMO have
   been invited by AMC/CC to accompany AMC aircrew on AMC organic military aircraft.
   Use 4MMO 00000000000 as the CIC. Afford them DV privileges. Manifest MMO
   passengers with other passengers. They may proceed to the aircraft with the aircrew and use
   crew compartment seats, if available. MMO is authorized only on AMC organic military
   aircraft.
   25.2. Mission Route Support (MRS). Passengers holding orders citing MRS authority may
   request TWCF cargo be downloaded up to 2 hours and 20 minutes prior to aircraft block time
   to provide additional seats when they cannot be accommodated through the normal first-
   come, first-serve passenger priority system established by DTR, Part I. When cargo is
   downloaded, MRS passengers shall be accommodated ahead of other duty passengers
   competing for the additional seats, since they directly support the AMC airlift mission. MRS
   authorization should be used very sparingly and prudently, being limited to those personnel
   required to perform time-sensitive actions that are critical to AMC missions, and are of such
   a short-notice nature as to preclude normal funding avenues.
      25.2.1. Approval authority for MRS on organic missions rests with the senior
      transportation official at HQ AMC, 618 AOC (TACC), or en route Air Mobility
      Operations Wing. When requested by HQ AMC to support TWCF aerial port operations,
      Air Force Reserve and Guard personnel are authorized MRS status for their tours of duty.
      Approval for Air Force Reserve and Guard MRS status rests with HQ AMC/A4TP. MRS
      cannot be authorized for anyone traveling in a PCS or leave status. Blanket orders are not
      authorized for MRS travel.
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                    43


     25.2.2. In addition to the fiscal data required for payment of normal travel expenses, an
     appropriate CIC shall be included in the orders. The CIC is composed of 15 alphanumeric
     digits with unused digits being zero-filled and constructed as shown in Attch 4. Except as
     noted below, MRS CIC may be used on military aircraft only.
     25.2.3. MRS travel is authorized on PE missions in direct support of TWCF airlift
     operations (i.e., cargo and passenger movement operations). PE MRS provides unfunded
     travel, but is NOT designed to support travel for quality assistance, staff assistance visits,
     or similar requirements normally funded from TWCF sources. Direct support includes:
        25.2.3.1. Range rides required by USTRANSCOM Instruction 63-8, Commercial
        Airlift Management Civil Air Carriers, conducted by USTRANSCOM/TCAQ
        contract administrators, and authorized air terminal and commercial gateways COR,
        AMC headquarters staff personnel, or other non-AMC personnel invited by or as
        directed by the Commander of AMC to evaluate service may be authorized MRS.
        25.2.3.2. USTRANSCOM/TCAQ-CO is the approval authority for PE MRS travel.
        At the local level, submit requests for PE MRS travel through the senior air
        transportation officer on station to the senior AMC commander on station for
        submission to TCAQ-CO for approval. On non-AMC bases, submit requests through
        the senior air transportation officer on station to the AMC group commander for
        submission to TCAQ-CO for approval. MRS travel requests by HQ AMC staff shall
        be routed to HQ AMC/A4TP detailing reasons for travel on PE and the costs to
        TWCF. Send base-level requests with the same information through the senior air
        transportation officer to TCAQ-CO. Submit requests as soon as possible after
        requirement is known.
  25.3. Air Force Academy Cadets.
     25.3.1. USAF Academy cadets traveling to/from overseas sponsoring agencies aboard
     KC-10 aircraft shall have the statement: "For travel aboard KC-10 aircraft only, CIC:
     4AFACADET 000000", in the remarks section of their orders. When cadets are space
     blocked aboard KC-10 aircraft, they shall be afforded priority over other passengers
     except priority one passengers.
     25.3.2. Cadet travel on other than KC-10 aircraft shall require a travel order. Cite the
     CIC and funding in Block 19 unless the cadet is traveling in mission essential personnel
     (MEP) status.
  25.4. MEP Travel.
     25.4.1. MEP travel includes Mobility Air Force (MAF) personnel (e.g. chaplains,
     Mission Recovery Teams (MRT), security forces (including PHOENIX RAVEN),
     Detainee Movement Teams (DMT) etc.) performing unique duties directly associated
     with and essential to a particular mobility aircraft, aircrew, or mission (except 89 AW and
     special operations missions). MEP travelers shall process through the passenger terminal

Section D—Passenger Terminal Security and Screening

26. Passenger Terminal Security. AMC policy is to prevent entry of unauthorized weapons,
firearms, or explosives into the Defense Transportation System. Personnel involved in all phases
of passenger terminal operations must be keenly aware of any unusual conduct of persons within
 46                                                       AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


the passenger terminal and alert to the possibility of concealed explosive devices, firearms, or
weapons.
   26.1. Passenger Terminal Physical Security inspections.
       26.1.1. External and internal physical security inspections shall be performed IAW
       Attch 27.
   26.2. Additional protection shall be locally developed with the use of Random Antiterrorism
   Measures (RAMs). RAMs should be part of the installation Antiterrorism Program IAW with
   current directives.
       26.2.1. Develop RAMs in coordination with unit Antiterrorism Officer (ATO) and/or
       installation ATO. RAMs will be accomplished only by passenger terminal personnel or in
       conjunction with Security Forces (SF) assistance. RAMs must be developed for all Force
       Protection Conditions (FPCONs). Develop procedures for selecting and implementing
       RAMs. Final determination of RAMs must be coordinated with the unit and installation
       ATO.
             26.2.1.1. Possible RAMs include: security patrols around the building, use of
             military working dogs to search baggage/packages, physical searches of
             baggage/packages, ID checks, and use of trace explosives detection equipment,
   26.3. Workforce Awareness. All terminal personnel shall receive initial and recurring
   antiterrorism/force protection, security training and recurring security briefings.
   Antiterrorism/force protection and security awareness literature and visual aids should be
   posted throughout the terminal.
   26.4. Duress Alarm System. Install a duress alarm system linking the security forces facility
   and the passenger terminal inspection area check-in counters, departure gate, and other areas
   as determined by passenger terminal management. The activation device (button/switch)
   must be out of public view to allow personnel monitoring/performing inspections to activate
   the alarm unnoticed. Portable activation devices may also be worn on the belt to increase the
   inspector's flexibility. Develop and prepare directives in accordance with AFI 33-360,
   Publications and Forms Management, for operating and monthly testing of the system.
   Ensure monthly testing is documented. Maintain documentation for one year then destroy.
   26.5. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)/Transportation Security Administration (TSA)
   security directives contain sensitive information. These documents shall not be distributed to
   aerial ports. HQ AMC/A4TP shall consolidate any applicable information and transmit via
   message to the units. Non-sensitive TSA travel information can be found at TSA web site
   (see Attch 8).
27. Robbery and Bomb Threats.

   unauthorized entry into restricted/nonpublic areas.
29. Passenger/Baggage Screening.
   29.1. Passengers and Baggage shall be screened IAW TSA prohibited items list. See Attch
   9.
      29.1.1. Screening. Screen all individuals entering the sterile/gate area using screening
      equipment (i.e., walkthrough and hand-held magnetometers).              The aerial port,
      transportation, AMS/LRS commander may exempt on-duty passenger service personnel
      or personnel directly involved with flight/passenger processing, i.e., Duty Officer, ramp
      controller and border clearance officials. The exemption must be in writing and the letter
      shall be available at the security checkpoint. This exemption list must be kept to an
      absolute minimum and is not intended for maintenance or custodial personnel. The
      preferred entry to the terminal for passenger service personnel shall be through card-
      reader or cipher lock doors.
   29.2. Passenger Screening. Passengers must remove outer garments (i.e., coat, jacket, suit
   jacket, etc.) that may conceal prohibited items. Passengers are also required to remove their
   footwear i.e., shoes/boots) and place the outer garments and footwear through the X-ray
   machine. If the X-ray machine is inoperable the explosive detection equipment shall be used.
   Note: If a member traveling in uniform notifies the screener that they are wearing steel-toed
   boots, the screener can opt to use the hand held wand IAW Para 29.2.3. without having the
   member remove their boots. However, if at any time the screener has suspicions, they can
   require the member to remove their boots for physical examination.
      29.2.1. Request passengers remove all metal objects from their pockets for visual
      inspection and/or running through the X-ray machine.
      29.2.2. Passengers shall then proceed through the metal detector. If the alarm activates,
      passengers shall again be asked to check their person and pockets for additional metal
      items. Once the passengers have rechecked themselves, they shall walk through the metal
      detector again. If the walk through detector activates a second time, passengers shall
      undergo additional screening. If you note anything suspicious, notify the passenger
      terminal supervisor. Security forces shall perform all required physical inspections (body
      searches) when circumstances warrant. PSAs trained and certified by local SF may
      perform body searches (pat-downs).
      29.2.3. Additional screening with the hand held wand consists of PSAs asking the
      passenger to step to the side. PSAs shall briefly explain the hand held wand inspection
      procedures. The passenger shall be asked to stand with their feet apart and arms raised
      parallel with the floor. The screener shall pass the wand over the entire body, close to the
      person, but without actually touching the passenger with the wand. If the hand held wand
      alarm activates, the passenger shall be asked to identify the cause of the alarm activation
      and remove the item accordingly.

     passengers IAW DTR Part III Appendix BB, Paragraphs G, H and Appendix T.
         29.5.1.1. IAW DTR Part III Appendix T, Troop Commanders must brief passengers
         regarding local restrictions and conduct at en route stops. During en route stops at
         commercial airports and military airfields, ensure passengers are aware that once they
         leave the sterile gate/terminal area of the airport they will be required to reenter
         through a security screening checkpoint and must comply with the local
         rules/requirements (Transportation Security Administration in the Continental United
         States [CONUS] or similar agencies when Outside CONUS) regarding
         restricted/prohibited items allowed in the cabin of the aircraft.
     29.5.2. When deploying passengers are authorized in their orders to carry firearms and
     are processed through the passenger terminal, either originating or transiting, they shall
     be allowed to retain their unloaded firearm provided it has been confirmed by the agent.
     PSAs shall brief the deploying passenger they must retain positive control over the
     firearm at all times. Any hand carried or checked baggage is subject to inspection.
     Passengers shall not be allowed to retain control of any unauthorized items. These
     passengers are not required to remain segregated from other passengers and may have
     access to the terminal facilities (i.e. snack bar, vending machines, and pay phones).
     29.5.3. Opportune Space-A/Space-R passengers who are not part of the dedicated
     mission, must be screened IAW Para 29.1.
  29.6. For direct to aircraft passengers (e.g., DVs, Secret Service, etc.) the aircraft
  commander or designated representative shall ensure they comply with TSA standards.
  Request a copy of the passenger manifest, signed by the aircraft commander or designated
  representative, certifying passengers are in compliance.
  29.7. Hand-Carried Baggage Inspection. Passenger service personnel shall inspect/X-ray all
  baggage (hand-carried items) in the presence of the owner at the time of entry at the
  sterile/gate area. Position the monitor so as to prevent passenger/public viewing. Honor
  passenger requests to have their hand-carried items inspected visually in lieu of X-ray.
  Require passengers to open their own baggage or packages for inspection and/or place them
  on the X-ray machine. Laptops and video cameras with cassettes shall be removed from their
  cases. Should the X-ray machine operator determine that a bag contains a questionable
  image, request the owner of the bag to open it for further inspection. Note: If you determine
  the image is a weapon or firearm not previously declared by the passenger, follow
  instructions outlined in attachment 24. (see Attch 23).
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                   49

   AMC Passenger Service personnel upon arrival at screening checkpoints. This can be
   accomplished by one aircrew member presenting a valid set of crew orders requiring the
   crew member to be armed or their military ID card and a gun card authorizing the carrying of
   concealed firearms. Once terminal personnel verify this, allow the crewmember to vouch for
   the remaining crewmembers. The entire crew shall then proceed through the magnetometer
   without removing objects from their pockets. This shall prevent passengers from determining
   which crewmembers are armed.
   30.4. Defense Courier Service (DCS) Screening Procedures. DCS courier personnel are
   generally not armed and may or may not be in military uniform. DCS couriers may hand-

   baggage is unloaded. The firearm shall be carried in a container considered appropriate for
   air transportation; i.e., suitcase, gun case IAW 49 CFR, Chapter XII, Part 1544. Furthermore,
   the passenger agent (Military Customs Inspector, if available) shall verify the presence of the
   firearm(s). Check the firearm's serial number against the accompanying documentation when
   required by the DOD Foreign Clearance Guide.
      31.6.1. Firearms in checked baggage or cases must be locked and only the passenger
      checking the baggage retains the key or combination (49 CFR Chapter XII, Part 1544).

  35.4. Customs Documentation on Organic Aircraft. AMC Passenger Service functions shall
  provide US Customs Forms (CF-6059B) for originating and through load passengers on
  AMC organic aircraft destined for the CTUS. This applies only for passenger-carrying
  aircraft traveling from outside the CTUS. AMC Passenger Service functions shall provide
  customs forms to the aircrew in the passenger manifest package at the time of the briefing
  referenced in Para 36.3 below. Provide at least one form for each family (or single member
  not traveling with family members) manifested to the CTUS. Also provide 10 percent
  additional forms in the manifest package in case passengers lose their forms or fill them out
  incorrectly.
  35.5. The total number of passengers manifested must equal total number of passengers
  boarded. If there are fewer people aboard the aircraft than manifested, check each passengers
  boarding pass against the manifest to determine who is not aboard but manifested. After
  identifying the missing passenger, correct the boarding manifest and comply with Para 35.6
  below. If the total number of passengers aboard exceeds the total number manifested, check
  each passengers boarding pass against the manifest to determine who is aboard but is not
  manifested. Make an announcement on the aircraft stating the flight number/destination and
  ask everyone to show their boarding pass.
  35.6. Baggage/Passenger Matching. Baggage belonging to originating passengers manifested
  and not present on the aircraft shall be removed from the aircraft. If passengers are rotated or
  removed from the flight then the baggage belonging to the passenger shall also be
  downloaded. No aircraft shall be allowed to depart the originating station until terminal
  personnel are certain there is a positive match between passengers and baggage on board the
  aircraft. Normally at en route stops passengers choosing to disembark shall be given their
  baggage. However, the aircraft commander may waive this requirement and allow the
  unaccompanied baggage to continue to tagged destination.
  35.7. Last minute add-ons or changes are done at the departure gate. Baggage tags, ID tags,
  and boarding passes shall be available at the gate. Notify the PSC and dispatch of any
  changes. To assure the aircraft commander that passenger/baggage screening has been

  by the departure gate agent. The agent signing the screening statement shall legibly print
  his/her name below the signature to indicate that the checks were performed. The required
  statements are:
     35.7.1. "I certify all originating and intransit passengers that processed through the
     passenger terminal and their hand-carried baggage were checked to assure weapons and
     unauthorized hazardous materials were not carried aboard the aircraft.
     35.7.2. "A boarding pass/ticket has been issued to each passenger that processed through
     the passenger terminal. Total passenger and baggage weights of these passengers are
     certified as correct."
     35.7.3. For troop movement use: “I certify that no unauthorized weapons/ammunition/
     explosive devices, or other prohibited items are in the possession of those personnel for
     whom I am the designated manifesting representative or troop commander, and that their
     authorized weapons have been cleared.”
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                       55


   35.8. Unsafe Aircraft/Conditions/Activity. In accordance with 10 USC. 2640, the
   following shall apply with regard to the authority to leave unsafe aircraft: "A representative
   of the Air Mobility Command, the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command,
   or other such agency as may be designated by the Secretary of Defense (or if there is no such
   representative reasonably available, the senior officer onboard a chartered aircraft) may order
   members of the Armed Forces to leave the chartered aircraft if the representative (or officer)
   determines that a condition exists on the aircraft which may endanger the safety of the
   members." Representatives of AMC include, but are not limited to, DOD Air Carrier Survey
   Team members, contracting officers, contract administrators, AMC ramp inspectors, and
   their superior officers.
      35.8.1. At military terminals, the TR, Aerial Port Ops Officer, ATM, in conjunction with
      the Senior Maintenance Officer and Carrier Representatives, shall thoroughly investigate
      each allegation of unsafe aircraft condition and determine if the aircraft is unsafe. At
      commercial gateways, the Detachment Chief/COR, in conjunction with the Federal
      Aviation Administration (FAA) and Carrier Representative, shall thoroughly investigate
      each allegation of unsafe aircraft and determine if the aircraft is unsafe. In all cases, if the
      aircraft is determined to be unsafe, the carrier is responsible for providing for passenger
      needs as stated in the contract until such time as the unsafe condition is removed or until
      other action, as appropriate, has been taken. Aircraft with maintenance discrepancies can
      be certified for flight by FAA licensed mechanics only. The TR, Aerial Port Ops Officer,
      ATM or Detachment Chief/COR shall contact the nearest AMC command post as soon as
      possible and request they forward a Beeline report to HQ AMC.
      35.8.2. If a passenger refuses to board any aircraft that has not been determined unsafe,
      remove the passenger from the manifest and return their baggage. If the passenger is
      Space-R, refer them to the nearest TO. If the passenger is Space-A, follow procedures
      outlined in Para 13 of this volume. Under no circumstances shall AMC passenger service
      personnel force a passenger to board an aircraft against their wishes.
   35.9. Denying Aircraft Boarding. At military terminals, the decision to deny boarding to a
   passenger displaying inappropriate conduct (see DOD 4515.13-R, C1.5, Dress, Conduct, and
   Standard of Service), is made by the shift supervisor, but may be elevated as high as the
   installation commander depending on the circumstance and rank of the person in question.
   At the commercial gateways, the decision rests with the shift supervisor and/or Detachment
   Chief. Once the passengers are turned over to the aircrew, the aircrew or the troop
   commander has the authority to deny boarding.
   35.10. Aircraft Quarantine Procedures. During in-flight emergencies for ill passengers, PSAs
   should not enter troop/passenger compartments until cleared by proper medical authorities
   IAW AFJI 48-104, Quarantine Regulations of the Armed Forces Para 12.
   35.11. Engine Running On/Off Loading (ERO). PSA's shall brief passengers about ERO
   boarding procedures and issue hearing protection prior to departing the terminal.
36. Manifesting Procedures.
   36.1. Manifesting Policy. The passenger manifest is a listing of all passengers aboard an
   aircraft and shall be accomplished when a passenger is selected for movement. The
   manifesting agency shall prepare a manifest IAW DTR Part I and/or III for all aircraft
56                                                        AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


  operated by the DOD. Manifest may be computer generated or prepared on a DD Form 2131.
  For Contingency, JA/ATT and Unit moves, The GATES importable manifest (XMAN)
  function may be used.
     36.1.1. PSA's will receive initial and annually recurring training on the GATES X-MAN
     function. The Passenger Service Center WBT and or hands on may be used to
     accomplish X-MAN functional training.
     36.1.2. Manifest Types.
         36.1.2.1. Pre-manifest. A listing of all passengers currently booked on a specific
         mission. The mission may be locked by PSC no earlier than 72 hours prior to
         scheduled departure. Once a mission is locked, PSC shall have control of the flight
         and may perform any booking function (port book, cancel, substitute, etc.). The pre-
         manifest may be utilized as a boarding manifest in the event of manual processing.
         36.1.2.2. Boarding manifest. A listing of all passengers who have boarded the aircraft
         on a specific mission. Manifests accompany the aircraft to its final destination.
         Sufficient copies shall be made available for the down line, en route, final
         destinations and all applicable border clearance agencies.
         36.1.2.3. Final manifest. Once a mission has departed, GATES automatically records
         the boarding manifest as the final manifest.
         36.1.2.4. TWCF manifest. Manifest used to produce accurate billing information. See
         AMCI 24-101, Vol 6.
  36.2. Manifest Closeout. Manifest closeout shall be no later than 1 hour and 20 minutes prior
  to aircraft scheduled departure. The flight controller or floor supervisor and PSC personnel
  shall keep track of passengers checked in. Every effort should be made to fill all available
  seats.
  36.3. Manifest Distribution. At GATES stations, final TWCF updating is done via GATES.
  For any passengers requiring special account handling refer to SAH procedures in AMCI 24-
  101, Vol 6.
  36.4. When an aircraft arrives without a passenger manifest take the following steps:
     36.4.1. Make a thorough search of the aircraft to verify non-receipt of manifest.
     36.4.2. For missions operating between GATES stations a passenger manifest may be
     printed. At Non-GATES stations see AMCI 24-101, Vol 9, Para 7.1.
  36.5. Aircraft Aborts. If an aircraft aborts and later departs the same day, information control
  shall notify the PSC of any changes and make necessary changes to the header information
  on the boarding manifest. If the manifest has already been forwarded to records/reports,
  inform them of the change. If the mission aborts and cancels, the PSC shall reenter the
  passengers into the backlog under their original date/time of sign up. Records/reports shall
  cancel the TWCF manifest.
  36.6. Manifesting Classified Missions/Prohibited Information. Security requirements on
  some missions may prohibit providing names or SSNs of passengers to the passenger check-
  in office. In such cases, the user may provide a signed statement indicating the number of
  passengers aboard and the agency maintaining the list of passenger names, and acknowledges
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                     57


   responsibility for any border clearance requirements. Passenger service dispatch shall
   forward this information for any border clearance requirements. Passenger service shall also
   forward this information to data records. This document is sufficient to complete the Monthly
   Station Traffic Handling Report (7107 report).
37. Delayed, Over flown, or Diverted Flights.
   37.1. General. When flights are delayed or do not arrive as scheduled, the PSA should
   announce the delay over the public address system and provide periodic updates.
   Announcements should include (but are not to be limited to) the reason for delay and new
   departure time. Terminal management shall ensure the ATOC aggressively seeks complete
   information from the controlling agency; however, the responsibility remains with passenger
   service to become actively involved in obtaining and/or providing accurate and timely
   information to delayed passengers. Keep flight information systems updated with current
   estimated departure/arrival times and passenger show times. Provide maximum assistance to
   all delayed passengers (see Attch 18).
   37.2. Self Removal. If an aircraft goes into delay at originating stations, manifested
   passengers may elect to be rotated from that mission and reenter the backlog at the original
   date and time of signup for any of the destinations for which they were originally signed up.
   If an aircraft goes into delay at intransit stations or returns to the originating station due to
   maintenance, weather, etc., manifested passengers may elect to be rotated from that mission
   and reenter the backlog at the original date and time of sign-up for their specified manifested
   destination.
       37.2.1. If a self-rotated passenger elects to change their destination they shall be entered
       into Space-A backlog with a new date and time of sign-up.
   37.3. Delayed PE Flights. Refer to AMCI 24-201 Commercial Airlift Management – Civil
   Air Carriers for detailed specifications relative to delayed passenger care.
   37.4. Support of Service Members on Delayed TWCF Aircraft. AMCI 65-602,
   Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) Budget Operations, Concepts and Accounts,
   Para 6.8 provides guidance for AMC payment of lodging and meals/ground transportation, if
   required, for service members in a group travel status (same orders, same origin, same
   destination and no per diem authorized) who are delayed while traveling on Special
   Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAMs), Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) Exercise missions, Joint
   Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT) and contingency missions due to weather
   or aircraft maintenance problems at an en route location.
38. Dispatch. Maintains current information on all aircraft arrivals/departures, receives mission
set-up and seat release, maintains AMC Form 108, controls the dispatch of vehicles to pick up
and deliver passengers to/from aircraft. Advises passenger ground services personnel of
requirements for baggage pickup/delivery and requirements for passenger powered/non-powered
loading ramps.
   38.1. At Non-GATES stations: Prepares the flight package consisting of a passenger mission
   setup folder using AMC Form 229, Passenger Service Flight Folder, (Attch 3), seat
   selection charts, DD Form 2131 and/or pre-manifest supplied by the PSC. Assigns manifest
   number/reference at Non-GATES stations. Manifest numbers/references are constructed in
   accordance with AMCI 24-101,Vol 6.
 58                                                        AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


   38.2. Passes all appropriate information and changes to the PSC and passenger processing
   shift supervisor, as applicable. Maintain constant communication with ATOC in regard to
   flight status.
   38.3. Determines if meals shall be offered and type/quantity of meals.
   38.4. Information control/dispatch shall make every effort to furnish the in-flight kitchen and
   fleet service a tentative list of meal requirements at flight setup time but NLT 3 hours prior to
   scheduled departure time. The tentative order should be a realistic approximation based on
   historical data and estimated passenger load.
   38.5. At flight close-out, total all meals and inform in-flight kitchen and fleet service of the
   final meal order. Initials and times are annotated on the top portion of AMC Form 162, In-
   flight Meal Supplement Worksheet. The shift supervisor shall ensure information on the top
   portion of AMC Form 162 is transferred to AF Form 79 (see Attch 14), Head Count Record
   before the shift is relieved of duty. Management may adjust final meal order time based on
   requirements and sequence of events.
   38.6. Final meal orders of sixty (60) meals or less shall be passed to in-flight kitchen to
   allow a ninety (90) minute meal preparation time prior to pick-up. For sixty one (61) or more
   meals a two hour meal preparation prior to pick-up shall be given.
       38.6.1. These procedures will be reviewed in March of each year to ensure these
       procedures are working and still meeting the objectives of the flight feeding program.
       The review will be conducted by HQ AFSVA/SVOFO, AFSVA/SVOT and AMC/A4TP.
   38.7. Primarily, use information contained on AMC Form 162, In-flight Meal Supplement
   Worksheet to control meal count on organic missions at Non-GATES locations. Complete the
   information located on the top portion of the form (i.e., mission number, type aircraft, aircraft
   number, and departure time). Annotate in-flight kitchen and fleet service initials, time final
   order placed and pickup time accordingly. GATES stations shall use flight status window
   within passenger mission ops function to control meal count on organic missions (until AMC
   Form 162 is included in GATES). Also, these stations shall annotate in-flight kitchen and
   fleet service initials, time firm order placed in mission monitoring sequence of events
   window.
39. Passenger Service Facilities.
   39.1. Many of our passengers are traveling with small children. For their convenience, a
   family lounge should be made available in military terminals. As a minimum, lounge
   furnishings shall include baby cribs with sheets, soft chairs, a bottle warmer, refrigerator, and
   toys for children. The Passenger Service Officer/Superintendent is encouraged to solicit base
   Family Service volunteers for assistance. The lounge shall be available to passengers with
   small children when the terminal is open (see Terminal X and Passenger Terminal Design
   Guide for specific requirements).
   39.2. Passenger lounges/lobbies are designated areas for passengers to wait the processing
   and boarding of their flights or for other personnel awaiting the arrival of aircraft. If your
   terminal has multiple departure gates, each shall be numbered or distinctively marked. A
   video display monitor/flight status board shall be located in the area to provide at least flight
   arrival and departure information. A television shall be available to broadcast local programs
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                    59


  or family oriented movies/DVDs. Comfortable, sturdy chairs shall be available in the area for
  passengers awaiting final processing. To assist passengers and reduce inquiries, time zone
  clocks should be placed in each terminal where practical.
  39.3. Special category lounges are primarily for the use of those passengers with the intent to
  travel in the ranks of 0-6 (or civilian equivalent) and above. Additionally, use of the lounge at
  AMC operated terminals is extended to all E-9, CWO-5, MMO, Blue Bark, Coin Assist,
  Medal of Honor Recipients, and Next of Kin (NOK) of Very Seriously Ill (VSI) passengers
  with the intent to travel. The privileges of the lounge are not normally extended to
  unaccompanied family members; however, exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis
  as determined by local terminal management. Special category lounges do not have
  manpower authorizations and shall not be manned by passenger terminal personnel.
     39.3.1. Any additional services such as DV baggage tags, first on/first off boarding, etc.,
     are not afforded to E-9 and CWO-5 unless traveling as part of official party of a DV.
  39.4. Under no circumstance is a passenger to be held "prisoner" in the gate area. This
  includes intransit passengers awaiting continuation of their flight. If passengers choose to
  leave the gate area they shall be informed of the scheduled boarding time. Passengers must
  take their boarding pass with them when leaving the area. During periods when there are no
  planned departures, anyone may use the seating in the area. When outbound flights are being
  processed, only those passengers holding boarding passes shall be allowed access to the gate
  area. The gate area shall be manned at all times when screened passengers are in the gate
  area. Where feasible, the departure gate(s) should have vending machines, telephones for
  both on and off base, and restrooms. Commercial gateway operations conform to security
  requirements as specified by local commercial airport authority and FAA/TSA regulations.
  39.5. Passenger terminals must be able to provide expeditious service to all passengers.
  Passenger check-in counters shall be identified to assist each traveler entering the terminal to
  proceed directly to the proper counter. PSC or CSB personnel shall direct Space-R standby
  and Space-A passengers to the appropriate counter for processing after their selection for a
  flight. Each counter should be able to provide one-stop service. Also, each position shall
  have a sign to indicate whether the position is open or closed. Do not restrict certain positions
  to particular passengers/flights unless expediting flight processing for short-notice seat
  releases or other situations as determined by the shift supervisor. To the maximum extent
  possible, special category passengers shall be processed in the special category lounge.
     39.5.1. Place stanchions in front of check-in counters and PSC/CSB, if deemed
     appropriate, to ease passenger processing.
     39.5.2. Counter positions should be secure from any unauthorized access. A baggage
     conveyor shall be situated directly behind processing scales to allow easy transfer of
     baggage from the weighing scale to the conveyor belt.
     39.5.3. At overseas locations where pre-departure/pre-clearance customs/agriculture
     inspections are being conducted, counters should be situated in a way to allow passengers
     to check-in and easily move baggage from the counter to customs/agriculture inspection
     counters.

   39.6. Military passenger terminals should set up passenger(s) arrival positions to allow the
   passenger(s) to process immigrations, claim baggage, and process through customs upon
   arrival.
40. Personal Appearance.
   40.1. Uniform Policy. Uniform wear is controlled by dress and appearance regulations of
   each service, not by AMC PSAs. AMC PSAs shall not enforce uniform wear. AMC or
   contractor personnel shall not deny travel, instruct passengers to put on a uniform, nor send
   them to a service representative. Service representatives (i.e. service liaison personnel) can
   enforce uniform wear if they choose, provided they do not interfere with the handling of the
   flight and are not in the processing area. Every effort shall be made to return baggage to
   personnel to accommodate uniform/clothing change as long as a mission delay shall not
   occur.
       40.1.1. Wearing of the uniform may be prohibited in accordance with the DOD Foreign
       Clearance Guide or restricted travel advisory message.
   40.2. PSAs must use the utmost tact, diplomacy, and common sense and shall get involved
   only if the traveler is dressed in inappropriate civilian attire (torn, dirty, tattered, revealing or
   suggestive clothing, etc.), has inappropriate personal hygiene which may offend other
   passengers or is in violation of DOD policy.
       40.2.1. Passenger footwear must not be of the type that could hinder emergency egress or
       increase chances of injury. The wear of open-toe or open heel shoes (five-toe-shoes,
       sandals, flip-flops, etc.) is prohibited on organic aircraft. Shoes with heels should have a
       wide base and be designed low to the ground. Narrow-based, high-heeled shoes are not to
       be worn. PSAs should be prepared to explain footwear requirements. Passengers
       traveling on organic aircraft should be advised that they might have to climb up and
       down vertical ladders to board most aircraft and to dress accordingly. This restriction

reimbursement. Authorized contractor travel shall be at the non-DOD tariff rate. If a contractor
has questions on the DOD tariff rates, they should contact HQ AMC/FM.
   41.1. Overages. Credit overages to the receipts of the day and not to the change fund (Attch
   13). Deposit only overages that cannot be traced to a passenger. Overages that can be
   identified to the passenger shall be returned to and receipted by the traveler.
   41.2. Shortages. Any funds found to be short shall be charged to the receipts of the day and
   not the change fund. All shortages shall be bracketed on DD Form 1131, Cash Collection
   Voucher, or NAVCOMPT Form 2277, Voucher for Disbursement and/or Collection, and the
   same account classification used for the deposit shall be used for the shortage (Attch 10).
   41.3. Reoccurring discrepancies. In cases when overages or shortages occur on a regular
   basis, the change fund custodian shall follow procedures outlined in DODFMR 7000.14-R,
   Volume 5, Disbursing Policy and Procedures.
   41.4. Passenger Service Agents accepting personal credit cards for payment must review the
   Credit Card Security Training information posted on the HQ AMC Passenger and Fleet
   Service Policy Cop annually. This requirement is to ensure compliance with the Payment
   Card Industry Data Security Standard(PCI DSS).
42. Accounting Procedures. The cash accounting period shall be for 24 hours, ending as
determined by the passenger service officer in conjunction with the local base finance officer.
The passenger service officer in conjunction with the local food service officer shall determine
the meal accounting period. These accounting periods shall be identified in passenger terminal

   be capable of accepting a removable money tray with a removable lid that may be locked
   when it is removed from the drawer and secured. Each cash drawer shall have a sufficient
   number of money trays available to permit a timely rotation of passenger service personnel.
   With multiple cash drawers and removable money trays, additional positions may be opened
   for passenger processing as workload dictates. Local management may use discretion on the
   number of money trays as long as service is not degraded but a minimum of one money tray
 62                                                       AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


   per shift is required. When counter positions are not in use, store the excess change funds
   IAW with procedures in AFI31-101, Integrated Defense, or appropriate service regulations.
   (Not applicable at commercial gateway operation locations.) Note: For terminals where
   annual monetary transactions are minimal (e.g. no in-flight meal service), local management
   may determine the need for a cash drawer. Passenger terminals shall have a contingency plan
   in place for unforeseen transaction procedures.
   43.2. The AMC Form 305, Receipt for Transfer of Cash and Vouchers, will be used
   whenever the transfer of funds is conducted between shifts, individuals, or external agencies,
   or when other forms of accountability for funds have not been established. Exception: AMC
   Form 305 is not required for each shift change if no funds transfers or transactions occur
   during the shift utilizing a specific (sealed) cash drawer(s). The funds custodian may elect to
   set up and seal cash drawers utilizing tamper resistant devices and the funds custodian will
   develop local procedures to ensure the devices are tracked and not tampered with. If a drawer
   is issued and the tamper resistant device is broken the PSA shall verify the contents of the
   drawer. The PSA must balance their cash drawer at the end of the shift, fill out an AMC
   Form 305, (see Attch 10) and have the amount verified by the shift supervisor. Before
   sealing the cash drawer, place a copy of the AMC Form 305 into the drawer and apply a
   tamper resistant device. Each shift must perform a visual check to ensure the tamper resistant
   device is intact and not tampered with prior to shift change. An AMC Form 305 is not
   required to transfer sealed drawers between shifts. PSA’s are not required to complete an
   AMC Form 305 each time change is issued as a result of this action. The change fund AMC
   Form 305 will be annotated when there is a change in the balance of the change fund.
   However, the supervisor must complete an AMC Form 305 prior to the end of each shift for
   accountability of the funds transferred during the shift. Ensure the AMC Form 305 is filed
   IAW AFRIMS to ensure accountability of funds and availability of an audit trail to resolve
   funds discrepancies (overages and shortages).
44. Change Fund Custodian. Designate an individual change fund custodian for the terminal
complex IAW local Financial Services Office (FSO), and DODFMR 7000.14, Volume 5,
Disbursing Policy and Procedures. The change fund custodian shall follow the appropriate
service's accounting/food service regulations. The custodian shall:

   installed X-ray machines or when existing machines have been relocated within terminal.
   This check must include measurement of radiation scatter or leaks.
   58.3. As part of the radiation safety training, all personnel should be informed that if a
   female thinks she may be pregnant, she must be tested at the medical facility. A record of this
   briefing will be annotated in G081, TBA, or AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health
   Record. Immediately remove any female who suspects she is pregnant from X-ray duty. A
   suspected pregnancy must be evaluated immediately by a competent medical authority and, if
   confirmed, the individual and her working environment must be evaluated by the base
   Radiation Safety Officer (usually located in the Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight of the
   base medical facility). The Passenger Service OIC/Superintendent shall follow duty
   restrictions placed on a pregnant female as recommended by the medical provider.
59. Civilian Employees. Civilian employees who work in the passenger terminal are often not
readily identifiable by their duty "uniform". Accordingly, it is difficult to discern these
individuals from passengers or others who may visit the passenger terminal. These employees
shall be required to wear badges to ensure their status can be readily determined.
60. Cooperative Military Airlift Agreements (CMAAs), Acquisition and Cross-Serving
Agreement (ACSA) with Implementing Arrangement (IA).
   60.1. CMAA/IA. The Royal Australian Air Force, Canadian Air Force, Royal New Zealand
   Air Force, Royal Air Force (United Kingdom), and AMC move traffic for each other under
   these agreements. Travel by implementation of a CMAA/IA is on a Space-R reimbursable
   basis. PSAs must ensure the accurate CIC is reported.
       60.1.1. When contacted by personnel from one of the CMAA/IA countries listed above,
       refer them to 618 AOC (TACC)/XOGC. Movement of foreign military cargo or
       passengers on DOD military aircraft shall not be carried out without the approval 618
       AOC (TACC)/XOGC, and receipt of the appropriate CIC. PSAs shall ensure all AMC
       standards are met and CIC is identified for billing purposes.
       60.1.2. All requests for movement of DOD military cargo or passengers on foreign airlift
       should be referred to 618 AOC (TACC)/XOGC for approval. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOGC
       shall coordinate the requirement with the respective country validator and provide the
       CIC for billing purposes.
       60.1.3. CMAA/IA passengers are granted authority to travel by message/memo. In the
       event a passenger does not possess this message/memo, authorization to travel must be
       verified through 618 AOC (TACC)/XOGC prior to movement. Messages should contain

Royal New Zealand Air Force          W01400000000000
   60.2. Passenger travel IAW ACSA/IA. Normally passenger travel is limited to Space-R
   passenger movement. Space-R passenger movement shall be coordinated with 618 AOC
   (TACC)/XOGC, by commercial phone at (618) 229-7405 or email: tacc-xogc@us.af.mil
       60.2.1. IAW the IA between DOD and Ministry of Defense of the United Kingdom,
       limited Space-A travel for non-duty passengers (e.g. those on leave, pass, or liberty) is
       authorized to and/or from: Diego Garcia; Wideawake Airfield, Ascension Island; and
       RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus.
          60.2.1.1. Space-A passengers must be permanently assigned to the remote location to
          which Space-A travel is authorized, and traveling to/from that location, to be eligible
          for travel.
              60.2.1.1.1. The space-available privilege extends only to the first point at which
              commercial transportation is available.
          60.2.1.2. Space-A passengers shall be accommodated at the discretion of the
          supplying participant, and subject to the supplying participants requirements and
          limitations regarding eligibility, documentation, sign-up procedures, prioritizing,
          minor fees and taxes, number of trips allowed, etc.
          60.2.1.3. Passengers of the requesting participant eligible for Space-A travel on
          aircraft of the supplying participant shall be prioritized for transportation on the same
          basis as similarly situated passengers of the supplying participant.
          60.2.1.4. Space-A passengers must present to supplying participant personnel,
          documentation from the unit to which they are assigned verifying that they are
          assigned to the remote location to/from which Space-A travel is authorized; that they
          are in a leave or liberty status; and, that they are therefore authorized to travel by
          Space-A airlift.
              60.2.1.4.1. Documentation must include POC information for the passenger's unit
              of assignment. Passengers must also present photo identification consisting of a
              military identification card, and a valid US or UK passport.
61. Calibration of baggage scales. Terminals shall ensure baggage scales are calibrated and
certified using the appropriate calibration authority and interval IAW T.O. 00-20-14.
62. Customer Convenience Improvement Program (Terminal X) and Customer Service

amenities comparable to commercial airports. Each terminal shall ensure America's war fighters
are treated with honor as they transit through the passenger terminal. The list in Attch 20
provides HQ AMC minimum standards for large and small passenger terminals.
   62.1. Passenger Terminals who are unable to meet these requirements must submit a waiver
   request sign by unit commander to HQ AMC/A4TP.
   62.2. HQ AMC/A4T staff shall perform passenger terminal Customer Service Observations,
   to include Terminal X criteria. All passenger terminals should receive an evaluation within a
   12-18 month observation cycle. The primary objectives are to observe the level of customer
   service, attitude, compliance, and teamwork being practiced in AMC passenger terminals
   worldwide. The Evaluations/Observations are performed incognito and the staff presence and
   purpose are not announced until completion of the observation visit.

Section H—Passenger Terminal Facility Force protection

63. Objective: To minimize the possibility of mass casualties in AMC passenger terminals,
prevent damage or destruction of AMC aircraft, and protect passenger terminal operational
capability from terrorist actions. The standards identified in this instruction are base-line
requirements. Installation and unit commanders may choose to implement additional measures
where local threat analysis warrants.
64. Mitigation Measures.
   64.1. Standoff distances from roadways and parking areas are listed in UFC 4-010-2, Table
   1(FOUO). Refer to local anti-terrorism office, civil engineering, and Unified Facilities
   Criteria (UFC) 4-010-1 to obtain the current minimum standoff distance and force protection
   measures.
       64.1.1. Standoff is designed to provide a survivable structure in the event of a vehicle
       bomb. For conventional construction, the standoff is expected to protect the structure
       from progressive collapse if a blast event occurs. The structure shall potentially be non-
       repairable, with major damage to structural members, but shall not collapse.
       64.1.2. Minimum standoff is determined by local standards for inhabited portions of the
       facility to the edge of the parking or roadway pavement. Portions of the facility that are
       normally uninhabited (such as mechanical or storage rooms) may be within the standoff
       area, providing they are secured against unauthorized entry.
       64.1.3. Access drives (such as for deliveries and maintenance vehicles) within the
       standoff area are allowed if they can be controlled at all times by crash rated gates, drop
       arms, etc. The standoff distance is not required on flight line side of the facility;
       however, all vehicles should be parked as far from the inhabited portion of the facility as
       practical. Vehicles parked within locally determined standard distances must be readily
       identifiable and examined (to include looking underneath vehicles) for suspicious items
       during external facility inspections.
       64.1.4. If a parking area or roadway infringes on the minimum standoff distance, the
       passenger terminal structure must be improved (hardened) or additional physical
       protective measures must be implemented to provide the additional protection. Adequate
       analysis by a competent expert, such as but not limited to Security Forces (SF), the Office
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                  79


     of Special Investigation (OSI), Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) and Civil
     Engineering (CE), must be completed to ensure the facility can meet the intent of this
     mitigation measure as outlined in Para 65.1
  64.2. Standoff from external containers:
     64.2.1. Minimum standoff is determined by local ATO and Civil Engineering Personnel
     from inhabited portions of the facility to external containers. "External containers"
     include but are not limited to trash containers (i.e., trash cans, butt cans, dumpsters) and
     external baggage storage lockers
     64.2.2. If the standoff distance is not achievable, hardening of external container
     enclosures or improvement of the passenger terminal structure to mitigate the direct blast
     and secondary fragment effects on the building are acceptable if analysis by competent
     experts (such as but not limited to SF, OSI, NCIS and CE) proves that it meets the intent
     of this mitigation measure.
     64.2.3. External containers shall be placed to be easily observable and checked or
     serviced regularly by terminal workers or responsible agencies.
     64.2.4. Eliminate amnesty boxes if possible. If an amnesty box is required by an outside
     agency, it must be easily observed and checked regularly by the responsible agency.
     Minimum standoff is determined by local ATO and Civil Engineering Personnel from
     inhabited portions of the facility.
         64.2.4.1. If an amnesty box for arriving passengers is required by an outside agency
         for arriving passengers to dispose of prohibited items, an amnesty box may be placed
         in the baggage claim area. The requesting agency is responsible for providing,
         maintaining, and removing deposited items.
  64.3. Increased standoff in higher Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs):
     64.3.1. During increased FPCONs, additional standoff or additional measures may be
     required to provide increased protection. Coordinate with unit and/or installation ATO.
  64.4. Unobstructed space:
     64.4.1. Unobstructed space around the facility allows for easier visual detection of
     explosive devices.
     64.4.2. Obstructions within locally determined standoff distance of a facility should not
     allow for concealment of explosive devices. Site furnishings or plantings are allowed
     within this area as long as any explosive devices placed in this area would be observable
     by the casual passer-by.
  64.5. Windows, glass doors, and glazing:
     64.5.1. Minimize the hazard to human life from flying glass fragments.
     64.5.2. Install a minimum of 6 mm (1/4 in) nominal laminated glass at all exterior
     windows and doors containing glazing. The glass shall contain a minimum of two, 3 mm
     (1/8 in) nominal glass panes bonded together with a minimum of .75 mm (30 mil)
     polyvinyl-buteryl interlayer. For insulated glass units, the inner pane must meet these
     specifications. Minimum standards for window glass are listed in UFC 4-010-2 (FOUO).
80                                                      AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


     64.5.3. Where new laminated glass is not feasible, a fragment retention film (FRF) can
     be installed over the existing glazing and windows. The FRF must be no less than 4 mil
     thick and attached to the inside of the window and frame according to the manufacturer's
     directions. If FRF is used in lieu of laminated glass, properly anchored catch bars must be
     installed to meet the intent of this mitigation measure. Competent experts (such as but not
     limited to SF and CE) must analyze any solution that provides protection from flying
     glass fragments to ensure it meets the intent of this mitigation measure. A certificate of
     compliance (C of C) from the installer/manufacturer should be kept in the Force
     Protection (FP) evaluation file. C of C should include thickness/type/size of existing
     glazing and thickness of FRF.
     64.5.4. When new construction or major renovations are accomplished, limit the total
     window area to 15 percent or less of the total exterior wall area and minimize the amount
     of windows on the front side of the building. Coordinate with the Installation
     Antiterrorism Office prior to submission. Skylights and glass blocks provide daylight to
     the interiors of the facility and are an alternative solution to windows. When used,
     competent experts (such as but not limited to SF and CE) must analyze and ensure that
     the placement, construction, and materials do not increase the potential for building
     damage or personal injuries. Skylights must comply with the same standards as windows.
     64.5.5. Glass doors must comply with the same standards as windows.
     64.5.6. Interior glass in close proximity to the exterior walls or in areas likely to be
     exposed to major blast effects must comply with the same standards as exterior glass and
     windows.
  64.6. Observation and monitoring:
     64.6.1. Monitor areas that are vulnerable or prone to a terrorist attack and criminal
     activity. Those areas shall be considered but not limited to: vehicle approaches, the
     primary entrance, out-bound area, areas housing critical functions, and any area that is
     difficult to observe and poses a significant risk.
     64.6.2. If a closed circuit television (CCTV) fulfills a monitoring requirement outlined in
     this instruction, the CCTV shall be monitored at all times.
     64.6.3. If CCTV is not used, the areas to be monitored shall be secured or observable by
     terminal personnel at all times.
     64.6.4. Circulation spaces within the facility should allow for the visual detection of
     unauthorized personnel approaching controlled areas. Clear lines of sight from the
     entrances and exits allow for the early detection of approaching vehicles and people.
  64.7. Mass notification:
     64.7.1. The facility must have a means to provide real-time notification of threats to
     occupants or personnel in the immediate vicinity of the terminal and instruct them of
     required actions.
     64.7.2. Install a Public Address (PA) system with selective polling in all public areas,
     including the exterior of the building at gathering spaces, such as the main entrance. (In
     small terminals, a PA system without selective polling may be used.) For convenience,
     the PA system may be configured with taped messages running at set intervals.
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                   81


       Additionally, PA microphone access for authorized persons at selected points within the
       terminal is encouraged.
       64.7.3. The PA system, if available, shall be used to make unattended baggage
       announcements IAW A19.2.2. The suggested announcement may be modified to meet
       local needs and will be broadcast at a minimum three times per hour.
       64.7.4. If a PA system is impractical (such as at smaller locations), alternative means of
       mass notification are acceptable.
65. Utilities.
   65.1. Prevent tampering of critical building utilities and environmental systems.
   65.2. Limit access to mechanical rooms, power/telephone cabinets, and power shutoffs
   (other than those required for safety reasons) through the use of door locks or padlocks, or
   locate them in areas that are not accessible by the general public. Power disconnect switches
   should be reviewed with CE and SF to determine whether the need to secure them outweighs
   the need to quickly terminate power to the equipment.
   65.3. Air intakes for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems should be
   located on the roof or greater than 3 meters (10 feet) from the ground. Provide an emergency
   air distribution shutoff that is easily accessible by building inhabitants (but not the general
   public) that immediately shuts down air distribution throughout the facility.
   65.4. Where it is not feasible to locate (or relocate) air intakes as specified in Para 65.3,
   ensure that the area is easily observed (or monitored) and incorporate inspection of this area
   into normal security patrols and random antiterrorism measures (RAMs) (see Para 26.2).
66. Deviations. Submit requests for deviations from security standards IAW AFI 31-101,
Integrated Defense (FOUO). Submit requests for deviations from AT Standards IAW AFI 10-
245, Antiterrorism, Attachment 6. Forward a copy to HQ AMC/A7S.

Section I—Baggage Services

67. General Information. It is AMC's responsibility to ensure all checked baggage be intact,
undamaged, and available to each traveler immediately on arrival at their destination. Careful
and considerate attention must be given to ensure each article is properly tagged, weighed,
loaded, and unloaded at each originating, en route, and terminating station.
68. Authorized Checked Baggage. Authorized checked baggage consists of personal effects
packed in suitcases, duffle and sea bags or similar luggage-type containers. Bags and suitcases
must not be torn or ripped.
   68.1. Baggage Allowance. Except as noted, passengers are authorized to check two pieces
   of baggage not to exceed 70 pounds each (140 pounds total) and 62 linear inches (the sum of
   the length plus the width plus the height). Single items exceeding 70 pounds and/or 62 linear
   inches shall be counted as two pieces and, therefore, fulfill the allowance for a passenger.
   Space-R passengers may purchase space for personal excess baggage (see Para 68.11).
   Space-A passengers are not authorized excess baggage. Items exceeding 100 pounds and or
   80 linear inches shall not be accepted. EXCEPTIONS: Large garment bags, golf clubs,
   surfboards, snow skis, bicycles, fishing equipment, rucksacks, and/or musical instruments.
82                                                      AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


  Snow skis, bicycles, and fishing equipment should be properly packed to avoid injury to
  baggage handlers or damage to other baggage. Only one of these bags per person shall be the
  allowed exception. The second bag must still comply with size restrictions and is limited to
  70 pounds. For Space Required passengers, B-4, duffle, flyers kit bag, diver’s traveling bag
  and sea bags shall be allowed as one piece up to 80 linear inches as long as they do not
  exceed 100 pounds.
     68.1.1. Mobility assist equipment such as wheelchairs, walkers, crutches, etc., shall not
     count as a piece of checked baggage. Mobility assist equipment exceeding 100 pounds
     shall not be accepted.
  68.2. Passengers processing for travel on Operational Support Airlift (OSA) (C-21, C-12)
  shall be limited to 30 pounds total baggage weight.
     68.2.1. Passengers processing for travel on Navy Air Logistics Office (NALO) C-40 and
     C-9 aircraft shall be limited to 2 bags not to exceed 50 lbs. total weight.
  68.3. Disposition of unauthorized weight or oversized baggage is the responsibility of the
  owner. Shipments may be made at personal expense via postal facilities or, if otherwise
  eligible, may be shipped at government expense. Personal arrangements may be made with
  the traffic management office for forwarding according to existing directives.
  68.4. Bulky Items exceeding 62 linear inches, except as stated in Para 68.1. If a traveler is
  required to accompany unusually bulky items that are authorized in orders, the Station
  Manager at AMC Commercial Gateway or terminal management, together with the
  passenger service officer, shall make the determination as to whether the item shall be
  handled as accompanied baggage or processed as cargo. The Air Freight Section shall assist
  in handling such articles as directed.
  68.5. Military or military-sponsored bands may transport their musical instruments as excess
  baggage. Each item shall count as one piece regardless of size or weight. Instruments must be
  stowed in the baggage compartment/area of the aircraft. Advance notification/coordination
  should be made so that airport/terminal representatives can make advance arrangements with
  local carrier representatives and ground handling agencies. Some types of musical equipment
  may be difficult to load through the belly compartments of narrow body aircraft.
  68.6. Military weapons palletized with baggage will meet Armed Guard or Constant
  Surveillance requirements IAW AMCI 24-101, Volume 11, Cargo and Mail Policy, Table 3
  and AFI 31-101, Air Force Installation Security. A weapon container requirement is defined
  as a hard-sided locked container, e.g., suitcase, gun case.
     68.6.1. Owning unit(s) or designated mission troop commander is required to provide the
     requisite number of escorts/armed guards. Note: If a troop commander is not identifiable
     (i.e. multiple individuals with weapons or non-unit moves) then the passenger terminal
     shift supervisor will designate escorts or armed guards from the individuals manifested
     with weapons.
     68.6.2. Integrated Defense Plans(IDP) and the In-Garrison Support Plan(IGSP) may have
     additional requirements for local bases.
  68.7. Allowed quantities of alcoholic beverages IAW the DOD Foreign Clearance Guide
  may be transported in or as checked baggage.
AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                   83


  68.8. Hand-Carried Baggage.
     68.8.1. Each passenger is permitted to hand carry one article (small luggage, garment
     bags, backpack, etc.) and one personal item (cosmetic case, purse, briefcase, small box or
     package, etc.) for storage in the passenger cabin area. The weight of these items shall not
     be considered as part of the passenger’s baggage authorization.
     68.8.2. Hand carried items shall be no larger than 45 linear inches and must fit under the
     passenger’s seat or in the overhead compartment. Items that are too large shall not be
     accepted for passenger cabin storage and must be checked-in. Hand-carried baggage
     storage on military aircraft may be limited. Passengers connecting to a military flight
     from a Commercial Contract flight should not be charged excess because of this reduced
     carry-on storage space.
     68.8.3. Baggage sizers shall be used to aid the passengers and the PSA in determining
     baggage dimensions. Baggage sizers can be obtained from various commercial vendors
     and must present a professional image commensurate with those being used in
     commercial airports.
     68.8.4. Passengers processing for travel on C-5 aircraft should be advised of the
     difficulty in climbing the deck access ladder with bulky hand-carried items.
     68.8.5. Passengers may also hand carry Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-
     approved infant car seats intended for use in flight. It is no longer mandatory to have a
     car seat on AMC owned or controlled aircraft, however, it is encouraged that children be
     restrained in car seats, which are appropriate to their size and weight. Infant car seats and
     fold up type strollers shall not count against the passenger's normal baggage allowance.
     IAW FAA Directives, booster seats, harnesses, and child restraint vests shall not be used.
  68.9. Cremated remains shall be hand carried on AMC military or contract flights.
  Dimensions of the containers are limited to the size authorized for hand-carried baggage.
  Cremated remains may not be transported as checked baggage. Discretion should be used
  when hand carrying cremated remains. They must be properly packaged to avoid upsetting
  other passengers.
  68.10. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) crews are allowed to carry Patient Therapeutic Liquid
  Oxygen Converter (PT Lox) as professional gear when positioning and depositioning for
  operational AE missions. The PT Lox does not require hazardous material certification,
  venting is not required, and processing through an aerial port is not required. AE Crew
  Members (AECMs) shall be in additional crewmember status and shall inform command
  post, aircraft commander, loadmaster, or boom operator of the amount of equipment and PT
  Lox that is to be carried on the aircraft.
     68.10.1. Passengers traveling on military aircraft are authorized to carry aboard, on their
     person, small personal oxygen cylinders for medical use. No more than two cylinders are
     authorized. Oxygen cylinders may not be packed in hand carried or checked baggage.
     The aircraft commander or designated representative must be notified of all passengers
     carrying oxygen cylinders.
  68.11. Excess Baggage. Baggage exceeding the normal baggage allowance as stated in this
  volume shall be considered excess.
 84                                                       AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


      68.11.1. For Space-R passengers.
          68.11.1.1. Authorized excess baggage must be stated in the passenger’s travel orders,
          expressed in pieces allowed, and subject to limitations set in this volume.
          68.11.1.2. Excess baggage not authorized in the travel order is considered personal
          excess and shall be paid for or disposed of by the passenger.
          68.11.1.3. If a charge is levied for excess baggage, it shall be on a per piece basis,
          based on the passenger’s fare (see US Government Department of Defense Airlift
          rates and US Government Non-Department of Defense Rate Tariffs, Attch 8).
          Authorized excess baggage is charged at the US Government rate and unauthorized
          excess baggage is charged at the Non-US Government rate.
          68.11.1.4. Personal excess baggage may be paid for by any acceptable form of
          payment (cash, credit card, or check).
          68.11.1.5. Passengers reimbursing AMC for excess baggage shall receive an AMC
          148-series form (boarding pass) annotated with excess baggage and the applicable

            416 starting with the lowest section needed on the tag and work up. Print entries
            in large, block capital letters.
            70.7.2.2.2. For domestic transfers, use city codes, full city names, or multiple
            entries, such as La Guardia, JFK. If codes are not used, show state abbreviations
            for cities with similar names, such as Columbus OH and Columbus GA;
            Charleston WV and Charleston SC.
            70.7.2.2.3. Enter total pieces, e.g. 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3, etc.
        70.7.2.3. When more than two baggage transfer stubs are necessary to forward a
        piece of baggage to its destination, use two or more interline tags. Detach any
        unneeded transfer stubs, cross out the number on the second tag and insert the number
        of first tag. Remove the claim checks, align the first segments of travel on top and
        staple the Tag together so the transfer stubs can be removed at each transfer station.
        70.7.2.4. Verify all baggage tag entries against the passenger ticket itinerary. When
        completing the transaction, inform the passenger of the number of pieces of baggage
        checked and destination. Give claim checks to the customer or staple them to the
        passenger's copy of the boarding pass or travelope. Attach the baggage tag to the
        luggage. Note: Dispatch will notify ATOC of interlined baggage on PE missions so
        that an interlining baggage onboard statement can be added to the mission load report
        (MLR).

     30 minutes, the pet storage area ventilation and temperature shall be checked at 30-
     minute intervals until flight departure. Additionally, at en route stops, the pet storage area
     ventilation and temperature shall be checked upon arrival. CORs and or ATOC
     representative must coordinate with carrier representative to ensure compartments are
     well ventilated and temperature is controlled.
         73.3.2.1. If the area is found to be excessively cold or hot, or if the ventilation is
         unusually stagnant, the COR shall be notified. The emphasis of the inspection is to
         determine if conditions in the pet storage area could affect the pet’s health and well-
         being. If in doubt, notify the COR.
     73.3.3. When passengers are allowed to disembark an aircraft due to flight delay, pet
     owners shall be provided the opportunity to visit their pets in order to walk and provide
     water. In any case, if ground time exceeds 2 hours, pets shall be offloaded and owners
     provided the opportunity to visit their pets.

   be available during all arrivals to process any mishandled baggage situations that may arise.
   The representative shall remain available until all passengers have claimed their baggage.
   This shall ensure passengers needing assistance with mishandled baggage shall be serviced in
   a prompt, courteous, and professional manner.
   74.2. All mishandled baggage shall be reported to the BSC. BSC locator information is
   contained in Section K below. However, mishandled baggage shall not be shipped to the
   BSC for disposition.
   74.3. All case files are automatically recorded on the GATES AMC Form 134a, Mishandled
   Baggage Summary, based on inputs to the GATES AMC Form 134. A copy of AMC Form
   134a shall be e-mailed, faxed, or sent by regular mail to the BSC by the 10th day of the
   month following the month being reported. For negative replies, send AMC Form 134a
   stating no case files reported that month.
   74.4. Courtesy File. This file shall be generated when AMC receives mishandled baggage
   from sources other than AMC-owned or controlled aircraft; e.g. commercial airlines, bus
   companies, etc. These files are normally generated when an AMC Form 47, Report and
   Disposition of Unaccompanied Passenger Baggage (Attch 29), was not accomplished.
   74.5. Scanning all necessary documents for electronic storage, including boarding passes,
   baggage tags, manifests, signed AMC Form 134s, Baggage Mishandled Report File, etc., is

          remarks section of the AMC Form 134. After the fifth day only the Baggage Service
          Center can update the remarks on AMC Form 134s.
      75.1.3. Give the passenger a copy of the locally reproduced mishandled baggage letter
      (Attch 30) and a copy of the completed AMC Form 134 with all applicable signatures.
      75.1.4. Prepare an AMC Form 136, Baggage Mishandled Report File (Attch 31). Keep
      the original signed copy of the AMC Form 134, and copies of the boarding pass, baggage
      tags or the flight manifest in this file.
      75.1.5. If the passenger traveled on an AMC PE flight, provide a duplicate copy of AMC

      line station as soon as possible, but NLT 4 hours after the passenger reported the lost
      baggage.
      75.2.2. Within 24 hours of reporting the loss, contact the passenger and give them the
      status of the lost baggage. Lost and found personnel may accept collect calls from
      passengers inquiring about mishandled baggage.
      75.2.3. The BSC will respond back within 12 hours of receipt of a "LAST SEEN"
      message on the status of baggage. If baggage is found, the BSC shall notify the finding
      and losing stations of the disposition instructions. If baggage is not found, the BSC shall
      notify the losing station of no match.
      75.2.4. If the baggage is still lost after 5 days the BSC will assume responsibility for the
      claim and take further action.
      75.2.5. Unchecked baggage will be processed as courtesy claim IAW Para 82.1.
      75.2.6. Lost and found agents will check mishandled bag notices every 24 hours in
      GATES until the case file is forwarded to the BSC.
76. Found Baggage.
   76.1. Only designated lost and found baggage personnel will be responsible for handling and
   documenting baggage or personal articles that remain unclaimed in passenger terminal areas.
   This includes articles left onboard aircraft as well as gate no-show passenger baggage. All
   articles will be secured at all times. Items having high value will be stored in a safe or other
   secure location. Only designated passenger service personnel will be allowed access to
   property on hand.
   76.2. Documentation.
      76.2.1. Prepare an AMC Form 136 according to Attch 31. AMC Form 136 shall be kept

92                                                      AMCI24-101V14 14 AUGUST 2012


     76.2.2. Prior to initiating an AMC Form 134, check GATES to see if a case file has
     already been established. If another station has reported the item lost, respond “ON
     HAND” in GATES and follow the RUSH Bag procedures in Para 78 of this instruction.
     76.2.3. All found baggage or articles will be documented immediately on an AMC Form
     134 in GATES. Attach one copy of AMC Form 134 to each bag or article. Before the
     baggage is stored in a secure location, it will be presented to customs officials for
     clearance, if required, and the AMC Form 134 will reflect this action in the REMARKS
     Section. Cross-reference the line number on the baggage tag with the manifest to
     determine the owner. Owners may be traced in GATES or by checking the Records
     section for a copy of the member's orders.
  76.3. Tracer action.
     76.3.1. Dispatch a priority "ON HAND" message in GATES to the BSC and each down
     line station as soon as possible but NLT 4 hours of finding the baggage.
     76.3.2. Each bag or article shall be matched against previously reported lost baggage
     claims.
     76.3.3. If the baggage is located without proper identification, it shall be inventoried by
     the passenger service officer/superintendent or designated representatives to determine
     ownership. Two or more people will always conduct the actual inspection and
     verification. In cases when it is necessary to remove the owner's lock to conduct the
     inventory, place the removed lock inside the bag. Upon inventory completion, seal the
     bag immediately with a plastic or metal fastener to prevent pilferage and do not re-open

information on the form is accurate and properly completed. All entries shall be legible and
written in ink, pencil, or computer generated via GATES. Place a dash (-) in or leave blank any
block not requiring an entry. Once the form is completed, it is reviewed by the shift supervisor or
his/her designated representative for accuracy and content. When satisfied that all tasks have
been accomplished and all entries are legible and complete, the supervisor or his/her designated
representative signs in the shift supervisor block. The folder must always contain, but is not
limited to, documents listed in the folder checklist. In the event a particular document is omitted,
an explanation in the remarks section by the shift supervisor or his/her designated representative
that efforts are in progress to obtain the necessary documents. AMC Form 229 may be printed

FROM:

SUBJECT: Dishonored Check

1. Our records indicate (Person's Name) is assigned to your organization. We would appreciate
your assistance in redeeming a check written by (Member or the Member's Dependent's Name).
During the notification to ("Person's Name) concerning this dishonored check, we believe a
quick review with them on the provisions of Article 134, UCMJ, Failure to Pay Just Debts, is
appropriate. We request you advise (Person's Name) that failure to redeem a check within 5 days
