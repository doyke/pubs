1. Administrative Orders. This instruction provides specific procedures for the processing of
AF Form 938, Request and Authorization for Active Duty Training/Active Duty Tour
(MPA, RPA: Special Tour, School Tour and Annual Tour); DD Form 1610, Request and
Authorization for TDY Travel of DoD Personnel (Civilian and Military). The following
regulations provide specific guidance for the preparation of these orders:
     1.1. AF Form 938: AFI 65-109, Preparation of AF Form 938, AFI 36-2254V1, Reserve
     Participation and AFI 36-2254V2, Reserve Personnel Training.
     1.2. DD Form 1610: AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders.
2. Unit Orders Program(s). All personnel (traditional Reservist, AGR, ARTs and civilians)
are required to use the Air Force Reserve Order Writing System (AROWS-R) to prepare AF
Form 938, and/or DD Form 1610 as applicable.
     2.1. Due to PERSTEMPO requirements, personnel are not allowed to combine multiple duty
     statuses in one order. Each duty type will require a separate order detailing the requirements
     of that particular mission.
DOBBINSARBI65-101 23 AUGUST 2011                                                                  3


       2.1.1. Missions that will be completed with multiple duty statuses (multiple orders) must
       contain comments in each order that the traveler will perform duty in conjunction with
       order ―XX‖. ―XX‖ represents the previous or follow-on order.
   2.2. If units have an emergency/immediate requirement and AROWS-R is inoperable, the
   unit commander will issue a verbal travel authorization to the traveler. If air transportation is
   required, the unit will need to contact the base Commercial Travel Office (CTO) to get the
   government authorized travel agent to issue the ticket.
       2.2.1. Immediately upon gaining access to AROWS-R, the unit will input the mission for
       which the verbal authorization was granted.
   2.3. All orders issued after the mission has commenced will contain ―verbal order of the
   commanding officer (VOCO)‖, statements explaining why the mission was executed prior to
   proper travel orders.
       2.3.1. Modifications (MOD) to all AROWS-R generated orders will be processed
       immediately upon receiving changes to any mission.
   2.4. Group Orders. This type of order will not be used within AROWS-R and all travelers
   must obtain a separate unique order.
3. Air Force Reserve Order Writing System (AROWS-R) User Role Responsibilities. All
units must assign user responsibilities for various functions within the orders generation system
subject to the below limitations. Members are assigned to order writing activities (OWAs)
within AROWS-R. OWAs generally follow unit designations however small units may be
combined to ensure sufficient personnel are available for all the user role requirements. At least
one full time employee must be designated to all processing roles that require a primary and
alternate member due to the critical nature of the responsibility.
   3.1. Role Delegator. This function is responsible for assigning user functions within their
   respective OWA. Each OWA will designate only one primary and alternate member (HQ
   SAM 07-02) to perform this user role.
   3.2. Supervisor. This function is responsible for approving all order requests and should
   have a basic understanding of the mission. Each OWA will at a minimum, designate a
   primary and alternate member but there is no limit on how many may function with this user
   role. These individuals may be a mix of full time and part-time individuals. Members
   assigned this role also act as the unit ―approving official‖ (AO) for travel settlements,
   therefore they must be on unit directed appointment memo and sent to finance. Memos
   should be updated as necessary.
   3.3. Resource Advisor. This function is responsible for approving the funding on all locally
   funded order requests and should have a basic understanding of the mission. Ensuring the
   order writer selects the proper line of accounting is critical to ensure proper flow of financial
   resources. Each OWA will at a minimum, designate a primary and alternate member but
   units should exercise discretion when selecting additional users with this function. There is
   no limit on how many users may function with this role. These individuals may be a mix of
   full time and part-time individuals.
   3.4. Order Specialist. This function creates all order requests and should have a basic
   understanding of the mission. Selecting the proper line of accounting and correct travel
 4                                                   DOBBINSARBI65-101 23 AUGUST 2011


     entitlements is critical to ensure proper support for each mission. Each OWA will at a
     minimum, designate a primary and alternate member but there is no limit on how many users
     may function with this role. These individuals may be a mix of full time and part-time
     individuals.
     3.5. Hard Hold – Unit Commander. This function approved unique situations to a particular
     order or an individual. Each OWA will at a minimum, designate a primary and alternate
     member but units should exercise discretion when selecting additional users with this
     function. These individuals may be a mix of full time and part-time individuals.
     3.6. Budget Analyst (FM only). This function ensures the lines of accounting are created
     and funding is provided as appropriate. At a minimum, designate a primary and alternate
     member but there is no limit on how many users may function with this role.
     3.7. Certifier (FM only). This function is the final approval step in the order generation
     process. Ensures the lines of accounting, mission execution dates and entitlements are
     appropriate to the individual and mission. A primary and alternate member will be
     designated and discretion should be exercised when selecting additional users with this
     function.
     3.8. Member Maintenance (FSMP and FM only). This role has the responsibility to add,
     remove and change members between OWAs. MilPDS populates AROWS-R on a weekly
     basis however FSMP may need to correct errors. Civilian employees must be manually built
     into the system and that role falls on finance to complete. At a minimum both offices should
     designate a primary and alternate member but there is no limit on how many users may
     function with this role.
     3.9. MILPDS Reject (FSMP only). This function ensures member mobilization and
     PERSTEMPO errors and rejects can be corrected. At a minimum, designate a primary and
     alternate member but there is no limit on how many users may function with this role.
     3.10. MilPay Specialist (FM only). This function ensures the pay entitlements are correct
     for the member as it applies to the particular order. At a minimum, designate a primary and
     alternate member but there is no limit on how many users may function with this role.
     3.11. Hard Hold Force Support Military Personnel (FSMP). This function ensures
     deployment availability and sanctuary waiver issues are annotated on the applicable order.
     At a minimum, designate a primary and alternate member but there is no limit on how many
     users may function with this role.
     3.12. Hard Hold Wing Commander. This function ensures deployment availability,
     sanctuary waiver issues and cross wing funding requirements are reviewed and approved
     prior to the order getting certified for execution. At least one alternate of senior position
     should be designated as an alternate member.
4. Order Modification Requirements. AROWS-R requires modification to orders types:
AF Form 938 and DD Form 1610.
     4.1. When Modification Is Required:
        4.1.1. Early Termination of Tours. In the event of early termination of a tour, modify the
        basic order to show the actual release date.
DOBBINSARBI65-101 23 AUGUST 2011                                                                5


       4.1.2. Adjust of Tour Dates and Report Time. Modification is required should the start
       or end date of the tour change. In the event the member‘s report time changes,
       modification is only required if entitlements change (for example, a paid travel day). Pen
       and ink changes are acceptable if entitlements are not affected.
   4.2. When Modification Is Not Required:
       4.2.1. Changing a member‘s grade.
       4.2.2. Correct inaccurate first and middle names and initials or other personal data except
       when required to enter a foreign country.
       4.2.3. Changing a Training Category Code (TCC) unless it affects member retirement or
       sanctuary status.
5. Military Personnel Appropriation Orders (MPA). MPA orders are funded by
commands/components other than the Air Force Reserve Command. Travel expenses are
charged to unit Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funds on Air Mobility Command (AMC)
and Air Combat Command (ACC) MPA orders via OBANS 6510, 65R6, 78GR and 78SF. MPA
orders require advance authorization which is provided in message or e-mail through the
Command Man-day Allocation System (CMAS) from the command/component. This
authorization will include the authorized unit, MEAN code, Man-Day ID, Mission, Dates,
number of officer/enlisted days provided and the appropriate ESP code. Accomplish the
following when preparing MPA orders:
   5.1. Include the Reference Authority in the Remarks section of the AF Form 938 -
   Authority: Title 10 U.S.C. 12301(d) & AFI 36-2619 Military Appropriation (MPA) Man-
   Day Program, date of HQ USAF/DPRR letter announcing annual program and appropriate
   command or agency code.
   5.2. Include the ESP code in Block 28. If not on the authorization message, the orders
   preparer must contact the POC for the authorization message and obtain it.
   5.3. Provide a copy of all MPA authorization messages to 94 AW/FMAO.
6. Authorized Mode of Travel. If the authorizing official (AO) fails to make a determination
or direct the travel mode, air transportation is the authorized mode for travel time and per diem
calculation purposes for TDY; unless the member demonstrates that air transportation cannot
meet the mission requirements efficiently or economically.
7. Travel Time:
   7.1. Travel by GOV‘T Conveyance and/or Common Carrier on GOV‘T-Procured
   Transportation. Travel time for travel by GOV‘T conveyance (except GOV‘T automobile)
   and/or common carrier obtained by GOV’T-procured transportation is allowed for the actual
   time needed to travel over the direct route including necessary delays for the transportation
   mode used.
   7.2. Travel by other than Directed Mode. A member, directed to travel by an available
   specific transportation mode but who elects to travel by another mode, is limited to the actual
   travel time used, not to exceed (NTE) the allowable travel time for the directed transportation
   mode.
 6                                                   DOBBINSARBI65-101 23 AUGUST 2011


8. Privately Owned Conveyance (POC). For TDY, 1 travel day is allowed for each 400 miles
of official distance of ordered travel. If the excess distance is 1 or more miles after dividing the
total official distance by 400, one additional travel day is allowed.
     8.1. Members electing to use POC must complete the special authorization form in
     Attachment 2. If there is a savings to the government, the member should list ―POC more
     advantageous‖ in the order. However, if there is not a savings to the government, the order
     should read, ―POC not more advantageous‖ and cost reimbursement should be limited to the
     constructive cost as detailed on the special authorization form.
     8.2. For all POC elected travel less than 400 miles, the special authorization form is not
     required and it will be assumed that it is more advantageous to use this mode rather than air.
     8.3. Local mileage and vicinity (in and around) mileage requests for reimbursement will be
     as outlined in Attachment 3. Do not submit a SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for
     Expenses on Official Business with your DD 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher, travel
     settlement since it is a stand-a-lone form.
9. Meals Availability Statements. Meals availability statements are required in the Remarks
Section of orders (AF Form 938/DD Form 1610) for all military and civilian personnel. Include
statements for each location in the member‘s itinerary. Use the following meals availability
statements as appropriate:
     9.1. All government meals are available and directed.
     9.2. Partial government meals are available and directed.
     9.3. Government meals are not available or directed.
10. Excess Accompanied Baggage:
     10.1. Excess Accompanied Baggage Transportation Charges. Excess accompanied baggage
     transportation costs may be paid only when authorized/approved under the JFTR paragraph.
     U3015-B and JTR paragraph C2302.
     10.2. Accompanied Baggage Transfer. Itemized necessary accompanied baggage transfer
     expenses are reimbursable except when the member is receiving TDY mileage or monetary
     allowance in lieu of transportation (MALT).
     10.3. Accompanied Baggage Checking and Handling. Itemized accompanied baggage
     checking expenses are reimbursable except when the member is receiving TDY mileage or
     MALT.
     10.4. Excess Accompanied Baggage Reimbursement. An excess accompanied baggage
     charge/fee reimbursement may be authorized prior to or approved after the completed official
     travel.
11. Actual Expense Authority (AEA): An AEA allows a member to be reimbursed, in unusual
circumstances, for actual and necessary expenses that exceed the maximum locality per diem rate
usually associated with lodging expense.
     11.1. May be authorized before travel begins, or approved after travel is performed, except
     for an AEA under JFTR paragraph U4250 which may be authorized only in advance of
     travel.
DOBBINSARBI65-101 23 AUGUST 2011                                                                 7


   11.2. Group Commanders/22 AF Directors are authorized to approve a maximum allowable
   reimbursement under AEA up 150% (lodging only) of the normal per diem rate amount.
   11.3. 22 AF Commander, 22 AF Chief of Staff and the Wing Commander are authorized to
   approve a maximum allowable reimbursement under AEA up 150% (both meal and lodging)
   of the normal per diem rate amount.
   11.4. All requests for Actual Expense Authority will be accomplished utilizing the format in
   Attachment 4.
12. Corporate Limits. Dobbins Air Reserve Base lies in-between the city limits of Marietta
and Smyrna, Georgia and therefore is not in the corporate area of either city.
   12.1. Normal transportation expenses are authorized for commuters residing in those cities.
   12.2. No per diem or travel allowance are payable for members whose Place Entered Active
   Duty (PLEAD) is within the physical property limits of the Dobbins Air Reserve Base.
13. Commuting Area for Dobbins Air Reserve Base. The commuting area is defined as those
member addresses for which the estimated one-way driving time to Dobbins Air Reserve Base is
60 minutes with traffic. Estimated driving times will be determined by using ―Streets and Trips‖
software from Microsoft Corporation or a similar program. A by-name listing will be
maintained in the Finance Office and periodically distributed in accordance with FOUO
guidance. See JFTR, Chapter 3 and 4, paragraph U3500-b for complete details.
   13.1. Impact. The commuting area establishes the area for which transportation expenses
   necessarily incurred while conducting official business in the local area may be reimbursed
   via SF1164.
       13.1.1. The commuting area also establishes eligibility for billeting and per diem
       entitlements when performing duty in/around the vicinity of Dobbins Air Reserve Base.
   13.2. Attachment 5 contains the particular details supporting the development and
   execution of the commuting area for Dobbins Air Reserve Base.
14. Lodging of Members Living in the Local Commuting Area:
   14.1. The JFTR specifies that members residing within the local commuting area are not
   entitled to lodging unless "required" to remain overnight. In order to be required to remain
   overnight, there must be an "operational need", not just for the convenience of the member.
   The only operational need specifically addressed in the JFTR is emergency situations
   (U4105H). Examples of other "operational needs" that may meet the standard for a member
   to be directed to remain overnight are:
       14.1.1. Security Detail.
       14.1.2. Communication Support.
       14.1.3. Other Conference/Workshop Support Staff.
   14.2. JFTR Vol. 1 U4102.E, states overnight lodging must be ―required‖ (not simply
   authorized). A blanket authorization must not be made, but rather a determination made on a
   case-by-case basis.
 8                                                   DOBBINSARBI65-101 23 AUGUST 2011


     14.3. If an "operational need" is established, the authorizing document is a memorandum
     signed by the Wing Commander, 22 AF Chief of Staff or AO for tenants directing the
     individual who resides within the local area to remain overnight at the conference center,
     workshop hotel or UTA lodging. The memorandum must identify the ―operational need‖ and
     specify for which nights. Reimbursement for lodging and meals will be actual expense, not
     to exceed the locality rate (JFTR paragraph U7510A1b(3)). Members required to perform
     TDY in the local area who are directed to lodge overnight must have a travel order to support
     payment of the claim (see AFI 65-114, para 3.7.3). The following statement must be added
     to the order as a Non-Standard remark: ―Member is directed to remain in the local area,
     memorandum dated (insert date). Reimbursement for lodging and meals is actual expense‖.
15. Special Conveyance (Rental Car) Use:
     15.1. An AO may authorize/approve a special conveyance when to the government‘s
     advantage.     When the AO does not authorize/approve special conveyance use,
     reimbursement is limited to taxi, other public conveyance or the appropriate TDY POC
     mileage rate per the JFTR/JTR. A traveler‘s personal preference or minor inconvenience
     must not be the basis for authorizing/approving special conveyance use.
     15.2. All requests for special conveyance (rental car) will be accomplished in memorandum
     format as illustrated in Attachment 2. It also provides for a basic cost comparison of other
     modes of transportation and must be completed.
     15.3. Approving authority resides with the Director of Operations (DO),
     Squadron/Group/Wing Commander or the AO for 22 AF and tenant employees as applicable.
     15.4. The approved Rental Vehicle Request memorandum, signed by the appropriate
     approving authority must be maintained at unit level. This document is an accountable
     record for audit purposes.
     15.5. It is mandatory, within DoD, to obtain rental vehicles through the CTO/TMO, when

          A3.2.3.2.3. If the traveler does not ordinarily travel by POC to and from home, and
          POC travel is authorized/approved between the residence/PDS and one or more

          driven, less the traveler‘s ordinary transportation cost to get to work and back home.

      A3.4.1.3. Do not submit a SF 1164 request for mileage as part of the TDY settlement
      documentation.

       odometer readings (or other acceptable evidence) of the actual necessary distance traveled for

          points for each day of the TDY.

                 DOBBINS AIR RESERVE BASE COMMUTING AREA

A5.1. Reference:
   A5.1.1. Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR), Vol. 1, paragraphs U3500 and U7150
   A5.1.2. Joint Travel Regulation (JTR), Vol. 2, paragraph C2400
A5.2. Dobbins Air Reserve Base Commuting Area Definition.
   A5.2.1. According to the authority provided by references 1.1. and 1.2., the Dobbin Air
   Reserve Base commuting area is defined as those locations for which the estimated one-way
   driving time to Dobbins Air Reserve Base is 60 minutes with traffic.
   A5.2.2. Estimated driving times will be determined by 94 AW/FM using Microsoft Streets
   and Trips 2010 software from Microsoft Corporation.
A5.3. Member Listing for Local Area.
   A5.3.1. A by-name listing will be published on the Wing Portal in the FM portion of the
   intranet site in a file entitled Commuting Area.
       A5.3.1.1. The address listing is active and will be updated as new personnel arrive or
       member changes occur.
       A5.3.1.2. To add or make address changes, an email must be sent to 94 FM/FMAO.
       The subject line should be: Member Commuting Area Change Request.
A5.4. Impact. The commuting area definition is important for three reasons:
   A5.4.1. Establishes the area for which transportation expenses necessarily incurred while
   conducting official business in the local area may be reimbursed via SF1164.
   A5.4.2. The commuting area establishes eligibility for billeting and per diem entitlements
   when performing duty in/around the vicinity of Dobbins Air Reserve Base.
   A5.4.3. Civilian employees on official business outside the commuting area require travel
   orders.
A5.5. Exceptions to the Local Commuting Area.
   A5.5.1. The JFTR specifies that members residing within the local commuting area are not
   entitled to lodging unless "required" to remain overnight. In order to be required to remain
   overnight, there must be an "operational need" as defined in 94 AWI 65-101, paragraph 14.
   A5.5.2. Exceptions to the above local commuting area will be requested in writing utilizing
   the format on the following page and be approved by the Wing Commander or NAF Chief of
   Staff.
   A5.5.3. The enclosed format for ―commuting area waiver‖ should have the ―FOR‖ and
   ―Signature‖ blocks modified to reflect the appropriate chain of command for 22 AF and
   AFRC tenant employees.
