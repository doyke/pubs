                                             Chapter 1

                                   GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope and Purpose.
     1.1.1. This AFI provides guidance for developing an Airfield Driving Program (ADP) to
     provide safe ground vehicle operations and pedestrian control on USAF owned and/or
     operated airfields. It outlines training requirements for all personnel (e.g. military, DoD
     Civilians, Contractors, etc.) who, as a part of their job, are required to drive unescorted on an
     airfield.
     1.1.2. Personnel required to drive on the airfield must be knowledgeable of and comply with
     the procedures outlined in this AFI and locally developed Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI).
     For the purpose of this AFI, the ADI is a wing or base level instruction.
     1.1.3. In today’s complex airfield environment, there are incidents involving aircraft,
     pedestrians, and ground vehicles at USAF airfields that lead to property damage and
     personnel injury. One of the most hazardous incidents for an airfield driver to be involved
     with is a runway incursion. A runway incursion occurs when an aircraft, vehicle or person
     enters the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-off of aircraft
     without approval from Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT). Runway incursions have the
     potential to result in aircraft endangerment and loss of life. While there are several factors
     involved in a runway incursion, the leading causes of these incidents result from a failure to
     follow procedures, inadequate vehicle operator training, and loss of situational awareness.
     Therefore, strict adherence to the procedures in this AFI is essential to preventing aircraft-
     vehicle mishaps and personnel injury on the airfield.
     1.1.4. Shared-Use Airfields. Airfield Management (AM) personnel at shared-use airfields
     (e.g. Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve units) must work with the civil airport manager
     to develop and implement local airfield driving procedures where applicable.
     1.1.5. Contingency Locations. At contingency locations, the Senior Airfield Authority
     (SAA) or equivalent, may authorize deviations to airfield driving procedures outlined in this
     AFI to support tactical or combat operations/situations. Authority must not be delegated.
        1.1.5.1. In the interest of safety to airfield and flight operations, deviations to this AFI
        should be by exception only and include a Risk Management assessment. Factors to
        consider for deviations include but are not limited to the length of time the operation has
        been in place and available resources.
        1.1.5.2. If time permits, or at the discretion of the SAA or equivalent, forward proposed
        deviations to the MAJCOM OPR for AO, or equivalent, for an operational review.
        1.1.5.3. Provide the MAJCOM OPR for AO, or equivalent, an informational copy of
        approved deviations to assist with establishing compliance priorities, providing oversight,
        and developing area of responsibility execution activities.
1.2. Waivers, Recommended Changes and Issuing New Airfield Driving Policy or
Procedures.
     1.2.1. Waivers.

     1.2.1.1. Waiver Authority. HQ AFFSA/A3A will provide waivers to this instruction
     only upon an official MAJCOM OPR for AO request when a requirement makes a waiver
     necessary or compliance with creates a hazard. HQ AFFSA/A3A grants waivers to this
     AFI for a period not to exceed two years.
     1.2.1.2. Waiver Process. AF IMT 4058, Airfield Operations Policy Waiver will be used
     to request waivers to this instruction. If additional space is required, annotate on plain

  RADIO COMMUNICATIONS PHRASEOLOGY, DISCIPLINE AND TECHNIQUES

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Radio communications are a critical link in the ATC system. The single, most
   important thought in communications with the ATCT is understanding. It is essential to
   acknowledge each radio communication with controllers by using the appropriate call sign.
   4.1.2. Brevity is important, therefore, radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible.
   However, controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly carry out their
   control duties. Conversely, the vehicle operator, must know exactly what the controller
   wants them to do.
   4.1.3. Vehicle operators must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic control radio
   communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating on an
   active runway.
4.2. Radio Techniques.
   4.2.1. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another
   transmitter will be ineffective and will probably override/block out the other receiver causing
   the other vehicle operator to repeat his or her call.
   4.2.2. Think before keying the transmitter. You must know exactly what you need to say
   before you say it.
   4.2.3. The microphone should be very close to your lips and, after pressing the ―microphone
   button‖, a slight pause may be necessary to be sure, the first word is transmitted clearly.
   Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
   4.2.4. When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling again. The
   controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or
   scanning the runway to enable your request.
   4.2.5. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver. Check your volume,
   recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit
   position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
   unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
   ―stuck mike,‖ and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the
   problem.
   4.2.6. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the
   ground station equipment. Refer to the airfield diagram to determine possible radio blind
   spots.
   4.2.7. Use caution when using a vehicle mounted/handheld radio and operating a vehicle at
   the same time. When possible, only use the radio when the vehicle is safely parked.
4.3. Phraseology. Vehicle operators must contact the ATCT controller each and every time
they proceed onto or leave the CMA. When proceeding onto a CMA, vehicle operators must
advise the controller of three things: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your
AFI13-213_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 12 JULY 2012                                                        49


intentions are. Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all communications so ground
control and other persons know that the message was received. Vehicle operators must always
give aircraft and ground control transmissions priority unless an emergency exists. VHF/UHF
transmissions are reserved for the primary use of aircraft and ATCT personnel.
   4.3.1. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows:

Table 4.1. Sample Runway Crossing Phraseology.
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “JACKSONVILLE TOWER
                                      AIRFIELD ONE.”
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD ONE, JACKSONVILLE
                                      TOWER.”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “JACKSONVILLE TOWER,
                                      AIRFIELD ONE REQUEST TO
                                      CROSS (runway) AT
                                      (point/intersection).
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD ONE, CROSS (runway)
                                      AT (point/intersection).

                                      OF (runway).”
   4.3.2. Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time for
   correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or if you
   do not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to repeat it. Good
   communications only occur when each party knows and understands what the other is saying.

Table 4.2. Sample Read back Instructions
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                      “AIRFIELD ONE UNDERSTANDS
                                       APPROVED TO CROSS (runway)

proceeds across the runway             or
                                       “AIRFIELD ONE, HOLDING
                                       SHORT (at location).”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                      “JACKSONVILLE TOWER,
                                       AIRFIELD ONE CROSSING
                                       COMPLETE, OFF (runway) AT

ATCT:                                  ―AIRFIELD ONE, ROGER.”

   4.3.3. If vehicle operators are issued hold short instructions, they are required to provide a
   read back to the ATCT.

Hot Spot—A runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically, it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Immediately—Used by ATC when such action compliance is required to avoid an imminent
situation.
Instrument Hold line—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect. Instrument hold line is marked in
retro-reflective yellow paint.
Light Gun—A handheld directional light signaling device which emits a brilliant narrow beam
of white, green, or red light as selected by the tower controller. The color and type of light
transmitted can be used to approve or disapprove anticipated pilot actions where radio
communication is not available. The light gun is used for controlling traffic operating in the
vicinity of the airport and on the airport movement area.
Major Command (MAJCOM)—For the purpose of this instruction, includes all USAF Major
Commands plus the Air National Guard Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve Command, Direct
Reporting Units, and Field Operating Agencies. MAJCOM also refers to the OPR for Airfield
Operations in this AFI.

Out—The conversation is ended and no response is expected.
Over—My transmission is ended; I expect a response.
Parking Ramp/Apron—Areas where aircraft are parked, loaded and unloaded and serviced
between flights. Vehicles and aircraft operate in close proximity in these areas, so it is vital to
maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and aircraft. Always yield to aircraft and never
drive under an aircraft or its wings. Slow speed and extreme caution are required in these areas.
Perimeter Road—A road around the runway perimeter designed to connect the access roads.
Precision Obstacle Free Zone—An 800 foot wide by 200 foot long area centered on the runway
centerline adjacent to the threshold designed to protect aircraft flying precision approaches from
ground vehicles and other aircraft when ceiling is less than 250 feet or visibility is less than 3/4
statute mile (or runway visual range below 4,000 feet.)
Privately Owned Vehicle (POVs)—A vehicle that is owned or leased by a private party.
Proceed—Authorization to begin/continue on approved routes.
Ramp—Either concrete or asphalt (depending on the weight of the aircraft and the sub-base of
the ground beneath) used to park aircraft or equipment.
Read Back—Repeat my message back to me.
Restricted Area—An area on the airfield designated for the use by aircraft/equipment requiring
security protection level. Marked with signs prior to entering, Red Lines will indicate the
boundaries.

Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect.
Runway Incursion—Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-
off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.
These are further classified into three operational categories:
   1) Operational Error (OE)—A failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of
separation.
   2) Pilot Deviation (PD)—The action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC
instructions, AFIs and/or FARs.
   3) Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation(V/PD)—Any entry or movement on the controlled
movement area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not
been authorized by Air Traffic Control.
Say Again—Used to request a repeat of the last transmission. Usually specifies transmission
was not understood or received.
Stand By—To pause while other duties of a higher priority are attended to. Also means to
standby for clearance/approval.
Taxilane—Ramp space between rows of parked aircraft used to maneuver aircraft to and from
parking spots and taxiways.
Taxiway—A paved surface for taxiing aircraft from parking ramp to runway.
Unit—For the purpose of this AFI, the term unit is equivalent to a Squadron, also known as the
basic unit in the USAF organizational structure. Squadrons are usually made up of several
flights (typically four), and commanded by a field grade officer.
Wake Turbulence—A phenomenon resulting from the passage of an aircraft through the
atmosphere. The term includes vortices, thrust stream turbulence, jet blast, jet wash, propeller
wash, and rotor wash both on the ground and in the air.
Wing Commander—The individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.
