                                           Chapter 1

                       AUDIT LIFE CYCLE AND MANAGEMENT

1.1. Overview. The audit life cycle begins with the planning phase and extends through audit
reporting. The audit team consists of the auditor, team chief, and office chief. This chapter
provides general background information on the audit process.
1.2. Installation-Level Audit Process. The audit life cycle consists of three phases: planning,
application, and report processing. The planning phase encompasses all the actions needed to
define the audit’s objectives, outline the scope, document the methodology, and thoroughly plan
the audit. The planning phase ends with completion of the audit program. During the
application phase, auditors gather adequate evidence to support audit results and provide a basis
for specific recommendations. The audit team then prepares the audit report to clearly present
identified exceptions and recommendations so management can take appropriate corrective
actions without the need for further review or study. The application phase ends with receipt of
management comments. During the report-processing phase, the audit team receives and
evaluates management comments, prepares and distributes the final report, and selects
recommendations for subsequent follow up.
   1.2.1. Planning Phase. Audit planning begins when the audit team issues the audit
   announcement memorandum and begins research. This phase ends when the audit team
   completes the approved audit program.
       1.2.1.1. Research. During the planning phase, the audit team acquires background
       information needed to prepare the audit program, identifies deficient conditions (potential
       exceptions) and their probable causes, identifies significant internal controls and forms a
       preliminary assessment of their effectiveness, and assesses the risk of fraud. Based on
       planning results, the audit team either undertakes a full audit or discontinues the audit.
       1.2.1.2. Audit Program. After deciding to initiate a full audit, the audit team identifies
       and limits the audit objectives to those fulfilling the audit purpose. The team then
       develops audit steps for each objective that fully document and substantiate the potential
       exceptions, underlying causes, and effect identified during research.
   1.2.2. Application Phase. Audit application includes data gathering, summarization and
   analysis, validation, draft report writing, and sending the report out for comment. The
   application phase begins when the auditor starts applying the audit program and ends when
   the audit team receives management comments.
       1.2.2.1. Data gathering includes all the field work the auditor performs, as outlined in the
       audit program, to gather evidence supporting the audit objectives and potential
       exceptions.
       1.2.2.2. Summarization and analysis includes compiling and evaluating audit results,
       drawing conclusions, and identifying potential exceptions.
       1.2.2.3. Validation is the discussion of potential audit results with management during
       the audit. Management either agrees with (validates) the audit results or management
       disagrees and provides evidence supporting their opposing position. As a result of the
 6                                                         AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


        discussions, additional audit testing may be necessary to obtain further support for the
        audit exceptions or to validate the new evidence presented by management.
        1.2.2.4. The draft report portion of the application phase includes drafting the audit
        report, reviewing the draft report, discussing the report with management, and
        distributing the report for comment.
     1.2.3. Report Processing Phase. The report-processing phase begins when the audit team
     receives management comments and ends with final report distribution. This phase includes
     evaluating management comments, preparing the final report, publishing and distributing the
     final report, and selecting recommendations for follow up.
1.3. Installation-Level Audit Responsibilities. The following paragraphs provide general
responsibilities for conducting installation-level audits.
     1.3.1. Office Chief Responsibilities. Office chiefs are the second-level supervisors for
     installation-level audit projects. Office chiefs will:
        1.3.1.1. Develop and compile the annual audit plan and forward it to the region chief for
        approval (reference AFAAI 65-103, Audit Management and Administration, Chapter 10).
        1.3.1.2. Approve audit starts, overall objectives, and project plans.
        1.3.1.3. Review and approve the optional Exception Report in accordance with
        directorate policy.
        1.3.1.4. Monitor audit progress and performance, and approve requests for deviation
        from the approved project plan (e.g., changes in project milestones, resources, or
        objectives).
        1.3.1.5. Promptly act on identified problems (such as access denials and disagreements
        with management officials) team chiefs elevate for resolution. Forward problems that
        cannot be resolved locally to the region chief.
        1.3.1.6. Review and approve draft audit reports for release to management and assure
        they comply with government auditing standards and AFAA policies and procedures.
        1.3.1.7. Ensure required quality assurance procedures (e.g., supervisory review and
        independent referencing) are accomplished in accordance with AFAAI 65-105, Internal
        Quality Control Program.
        1.3.1.8. Review working papers in accordance with directorate policy. If the directorate
        does not specify, the minimum requirement is one set of audit working papers per team
        every 6 months. Office chiefs will use either the Working Paper Review Checklist on the
        AFAA Home Community of Practice (CoP) or a similar locally developed checklist.
        After completing the working paper review, the office chief will discuss the results with
        the auditor and team chief. In addition, the office chief will maintain a file of completed
        working paper review checklists for ready reference. Note: Office chiefs should
        normally select completed projects for review.
     1.3.2. Team Chief Responsibilities. Team chiefs are the first-level supervisors for
     installation-level audit projects. Team chiefs will:
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                  7


     1.3.2.1. Maintain contact with local management and Air Force Office of Special
     Investigations (AFOSI) officials, and develop issues to include in annual audit plans.
     Team Chiefs should contact AFOSI offices at bases they are responsible for at least
     quarterly to discuss potential areas of fraud.
     1.3.2.2. Provide auditors with project assignments, guidance, technical assistance, and
     training.
     1.3.2.3. Participate in developing and finalizing the optional Exception Report, in
     accordance with directorate policy.
     1.3.2.4. Monitor audit progress and performance and keep the office chief informed of
     project status in accordance with area audit office (AAO) policies and procedures. Team
     chiefs should use the Project Status Report template located in the TeamMate library or a
     suitable locally developed report for this purpose.
     1.3.2.5. Ensure auditors conduct all assignments in accordance with government auditing
     standards and AFAA audit policies and procedures.
     1.3.2.6. Review and sign-off on all audit working papers. Document review results
     using TeamMate coaching notes.
     1.3.2.7. Assist auditors in planning the audit, review the planning-phase working papers,
     evaluate the planning-phase research results, and approve the audit program.
     1.3.2.8. Monitor application activities to verify auditors achieve all audit objectives. As
     time permits, accomplish periodic site visits during the audit application phase.
     1.3.2.9. Act on identified problems (e.g., access denial or disagreements with
     management officials). Elevate problems that cannot be resolved to the office chief.
     1.3.2.10. Evaluate requests to deviate from audit project milestones, resources, or
     objectives. If deemed appropriate, elevate requests to the office chief for approval.
     1.3.2.11. Participate (to the maximum extent possible) in in-brief, validation, and out-
     brief discussions with management officials.
     1.3.2.12. Review and approve draft audit reports before office chief review.
     1.3.2.13. Appoint an auditor not associated with the audit to independently reference the
     draft report before soliciting management comments.
     1.3.2.14. Review and approve the evaluation of management comments before office
     chief review.
  1.3.3. Auditor Responsibilities. Auditors manage assigned audit projects in accordance with
  government auditing standards and AFAA policies and procedures. Auditors will:
     1.3.3.1. Document all work performed and evidence gathered in electronic working
     paper files in accordance with AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6 and Attachments 6 and 7. The
     auditor must use the latest TeamMate library on the AFAA Home CoP to prepare and
     maintain working papers. Auditors may add to, but not delete from, the AFAA-approved
     TeamMate library.
     1.3.3.2. Respond to and clear all TeamMate coaching notes.

        1.3.3.3. Perform planning work using the latest version of the Local Audit Planning
        Program available in the TeamMate Local Template Library. Evaluate planning results,
        formulate audit objectives, and prepare the audit program.
        1.3.3.4. Develop audit exceptions in accordance with AFAA and directorate policy.
        1.3.3.5. Gather data in accordance with the audit program; answer all audit steps and
        assure sufficient, appropriate evidence is gathered to reach a conclusion on each
        announced objective; and validate the audit conclusions with management officials.
        1.3.3.6. Resolve or elevate problems (such as access denial or disagreements with
        management officials; significant audit results requiring interim reporting; and the
        potential need to deviate from audit milestones, resources, or objectives).
        1.3.3.7. Summarize audit results, identify report issues, prepare the draft report, and
        elevate the completed draft to the team chief for approval. Once approved, discuss the
        report with management officials.
        1.3.3.8. Evaluate management comments, prepare the final report, and complete and
        finalize the working papers.
1.4. Audit Project Management.
     1.4.1. Project Planning. AFAA developed the AFAA Management Information System
     (AFAA MIS) to plan and manage individual audit projects. The Project Plan Report is the
     primary AFAA MIS product personnel use to manage audit projects. At the start of each
     assignment, the audit team enters project information (milestones and resources) in the
     AFAA MIS. The audit team continuously updates the AFAA MIS to reflect actual milestone
     completion and resource utilization.
     1.4.2. Cancellations. When announced audits are subsequently cancelled, the audit team will
     prepare a notification memorandum stating reasons for the cancellation and send the
     memorandum to each addressee that received the original announcement.
1.5. Legal and Technical Assistance.
     1.5.1. Legal Consultation. Audit teams can obtain opinions, interpretations, or clarifications
     from legal experts at assigned installations when issues arise related to locally initiated audit
     efforts.
        1.5.1.1. Major Command. When the audit team cannot obtain adequate guidance locally,
        request assistance from major command (MAJCOM) personnel after first coordinating
        with the office chief and applicable AFAA MAJCOM representative.
        1.5.1.2. HQ USAF. If necessary, the team chief may elevate issues through AFAA
        channels to HQ USAF. For example, the Air Force General Counsel (SAF/GC) will
        provide AFAA with advisory legal interpretations on issues requiring a final Air Force
        position. Reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 16.
     1.5.2. Technical Consultation. To the maximum extent possible, installation-level auditors
     should obtain technical expertise from the centrally directed audit (CDA) divisions.
     Collectively, the associate directors, program managers, and audit managers assigned to these
     divisions possess a high degree of knowledge within their respective areas of responsibility.
     Direct questions or requests for information to the applicable CDA division. The appropriate
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                   9


   Functional Area Center of Excellence can be accessed from the AFAA Home CoP. To
   obtain technical assistance outside AFAA, follow the procedures in AFAAI 65103, Chapter
   20.
1.6. Timely Audit Completion. Timely audit completion provides an essential service to
management and meets the audit standard for timely reporting. Toward this end, audit teams
(auditor, team chief, and office chief) should establish realistic milestones in AFAA MIS at the
start of each audit, and the office chief should carefully review monthly AFAA MIS reports to
monitor team progress in meeting the resource and milestone targets.
   1.6.1. To assist in making timely decisions relative to the audit resource investment, the
   office chief should establish thresholds (resource and milestone) that, if exceeded, require a
   briefing from the audit team.
   1.6.2. When it is necessary to exceed the resources or milestones specified for application of
   a CDA, follow the guidance in AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 4.
1.7. Audit Working Papers. The auditor will prepare working papers for each project in
standard AFAA format following the guidance in paragraph 3.3 and AFAAI 65-103, Chapters 5
and 6. Auditors will start each audit using the latest TeamMate library available on the AFAA
Home CoP for installation-level audits. In addition, AFAA-specific toolbars provide shortcuts
for more efficiently preparing audit working papers. All working papers, templates, toolbars,
and other files mentioned within this instruction are available through the AFAA Home CoP and
the ―101 Reference Locator‖.
1.8. Exception Report. The Exception Report is an optional tool for the audit team to use in
reaching consensus on the essential attributes of each exception. The goal is to obtain early
agreement on the exception attributes, thus reducing report writing and processing time. Each
directorate will develop its own policy for using the Exception Report. The auditor can use the
Exception Report during validation discussions; however, do not leave copies with management
after discussions.
1.9. Audits Involving Non-Air Force Activities. When auditors conducting installation-level
audit projects (not CDAs) discover they need to obtain information from or issue reports to non-
Air Force activities, they must first contact HQ AFAA/DOO, through their chain of command, to
obtain assistance. If appropriate, HQ AFAA/DOO will coordinate with the Department of
Defense Office of the Deputy Inspector General for Auditing (ODIG-AUD) to arrange access to
non-Air Force activity personnel and records or process the report. This coordination could take
up to 30 days, so advance planning is extremely important. Note: For CDA projects, the audit
manager will obtain all required ODIG-AUD coordination (through HQ AFAA/DOO). Also, for
purposes of this discussion, the coordination may need to occur with the Army Audit Agency or
Naval Audit Service. Reference AFAA 65-103, Chapter 3, for procedures on audits involving
non-Air Force activities.

                                           Chapter 2

                                     AUDIT PLANNING

2.1. Overview. The main purpose of the planning phase is to obtain all the information needed
to determine the audit scope and objectives and to develop the plan for subsequent in-depth audit
work. The actual amount of planning work accomplished will vary from audit to audit and
depend mainly on the audit team’s experience, familiarity with the subject area, and
understanding of the control environment. This chapter identifies planning-phase responsibilities
and provides guidance for conducting the audit planning phase. The TeamMate Local Template
Library contains a Local Audit Planning Program, which provides additional guidance for
conducting the planning phase of installation-level audits.
2.2. Planning Responsibilities.
   2.2.1. The office chief will:
       2.2.1.1. Coordinate with team chiefs on and approve new audit assignments.
       2.2.1.2. Verify the audit planning phase was conducted in accordance with government
       auditing standards and AFAA policies and procedures during working paper reviews
       (reference paragraph 1.3.1.8). Provide feedback on the reviews to the team chiefs and
       auditors. The Working Paper Review Checklist, available on the AFAA Home CoP,
       provides guidance for conducting the planning-phase review.
       2.2.1.3. Review a sample of audit programs during site visits to assure the programs
       included all required elements. Provide feedback on the reviews to the team chiefs and
       auditors.
   2.2.2. The team chief will:
       2.2.2.1. Coordinate audit subject assignments with the office chief.
       2.2.2.2. Informally coordinate with the local AFOSI detachment commander on planned
       audits that may involve fraud. This action is primarily a courtesy to keep the local
       AFOSI detachment informed of current areas of audit interest. A possible by-product is
       the informal exchange of information of mutual interest.
       2.2.2.3. Continuously monitor auditor progress during the planning phase, provide
       assistance as needed, and assure the auditor conducts the planning phase in accordance
       with government auditing standards and AFAA policies and procedures.
       2.2.2.4. Ensure the auditor uses the Local Audit Planning Program and either completes
       each required step or provides rationale for not completing the step.
       2.2.2.5. Review planning-phase working papers periodically, based on auditor skill level
       and experience, and document the review with TeamMate coaching notes following the
       procedures in paragraph 3.3.3 The team chief will:
           2.2.2.5.1. Complete the review before the auditor enters the application phase.
           2.2.2.5.2. Electronically sign-off on each working paper reviewed.
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                   11


       2.2.2.6. Review and approve the auditor’s program for the application phase and ensure
       the program includes the agreed-upon objectives and a series of steps that would
       reasonably accomplish each objective. The team chief will also approve any changes the
       auditor makes to the audit program during the application phase.
   2.2.3. The auditor will:
       2.2.3.1. Conduct the audit planning phase in accordance with government auditing
       standards and AFAA policies and procedures (reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 8).
       2.2.3.2. Prepare the audit announcement memorandum for team chief signature and in-
       brief the audit.
       2.2.3.3. Use the Local Audit Planning Program to conduct the audit planning phase. The
       auditor will answer each step in the planning program and will not answer a planning-
       phase step ―NA‖ without providing rationale and obtaining team chief approval.
       2.2.3.4. Document the results of planning-phase discussions, audit tests, internal control
       reviews, etc. in working papers following the guidance in paragraph 3.3 The auditor will
       hyperlink the Local Audit Planning Program responses to the supporting working papers.
       2.2.3.5. Summarize the planning-phase results in a working paper that also provides
       rationale for either continuing or terminating the project.
       2.2.3.6. Prepare an audit program that includes the audit objectives and a series of steps
       to answer each objective. The audit program will include the elements described in
       paragraph 2.8
       2.2.3.7. Respond to the team chief’s coaching notes by answering questions, responding
       to general comments, and accomplishing any additional directed tasks.
2.3. Subject Selection and Coordination. The assignment of audits is normally an office chief
responsibility. However, the process varies among offices and is usually the result of a
collective effort on the part of the office chief, team chief, and auditor. Note: The process of
identifying potential audit subjects for and preparing the annual audit plan is described in AFAAI
65-103, Chapter 10.
   2.3.1. Selection. Team and office chiefs should assign audit projects from the annual plan
   consistent with the criteria in AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 10. Factors to consider include skill,
   experience, and interests of the auditor; time constraints, if any; and subject priority.
   2.3.2. Coordination. Before assigning a locally initiated audit project, the team chief will
   ensure the proposed project does not conflict with a recently completed, ongoing, or planned
   CDA (reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 10). In making this determination, the team chief
   should review the current Annual Plan, CDA reports listed on the AFAA Home CoP, AFAA
   MIS Web Reports and the DAMIS Corporate View. If the team chief has any doubts about
   potential conflicts, the team chief should contact the associate director for the subject area.
   Note: The team chief should provide search results obtained pursuant to this requirement, if
   any, to the assigned auditor (paragraph 2.5.2.2).
       2.3.2.1. If a planned local audit potentially conflicts with a prior, ongoing, or scheduled
       CDA, the team chief must (prior to starting the local audit) contact the appropriate
 12                                                         AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


      associate director and obtain approval to start the audit. If approved, the team chief will
      provide coordination documentation to the auditor for inclusion in the working papers.
      2.3.2.2. This limitation is intended to preclude potential ―double jeopardy‖ where the
      CDA report includes an Air Force-wide recommendation for corrective action, and then a
      subsequent installation-level report makes essentially the same recommendation to a local
      commander. The local commander should already have action underway to correct the
      conditions as a result of HQ Air Force or MAJCOM direction in response to the
      Air Force-wide audit recommendation. This policy should also preclude the potential for
      double counting potential monetary benefits (PMB). If the CDA team projected PMB
      Air Force-wide, then a subsequent installation-level audit team will not claim PMB for
      essentially the same audit result.
      2.3.2.3. This limitation does not apply where circumstances warrant otherwise such as
      commander interest, suspected fraud, or follow-up efforts on local work performed as
      part of a CDA. However, in those circumstances, the installation-level report will cite the
      Air Force-wide report of audit and its audit results and recommendations.
2.4. Planning—Initial Requirements. At the start of each audit project, the team chief will
provide the auditor a completed Project Plan Report and discuss with the auditor the scope,
objectives, and basic approach of the audit planning. The auditor will then complete and
distribute the audit announcement memorandum, in-brief management, and conduct preliminary
research.
   2.4.1. Audit Announcement Memorandum. The audit team provides applicable commanders
   written notification at least 2 weeks prior to the start of each audit (locally initiated audits and
   CDAs). A TeamMate template provides guidance for preparing the audit announcement
   memorandum. Note: Audit teams should not provide advance notification for cash counts or
   other audits where surprise is essential in accomplishing the audit objectives.
      2.4.1.1. Memorandum Contents. The audit memorandum will:
          2.4.1.1.1. Identify the audit title and project number in the subject line.
          2.4.1.1.2. Identify the organizations to be audited (if not obvious).
          2.4.1.1.3. Identify the audit start date and objectives, to the extent known at the time
          the memorandum is prepared.
          2.4.1.1.4. Identify the assigned auditor, telephone number, e-mail address, and
          security clearance.
          2.4.1.1.5. Request the names, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses of the subject
          area focal points.
          2.4.1.1.6. Offer to schedule an in-brief or provide an opportunity for management to
          express any concerns.
          2.4.1.1.7. Ask unit commanders about potential deployments, exercises, and
          inspection conflicts.
          2.4.1.1.8. Include team chief signature block and distribution. Distribution will
          include all local offices affected by the audit, the installation and MAJCOM audit
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                13


        focal points, the installation and MAJCOM gatekeepers (paragraph 2.4.1.2), and the
        responsible AFOSI detachment.
     2.4.1.2. Installation and MAJCOM Gatekeepers. The audit team will send the audit
     announcement to the applicable base and MAJCOM gatekeepers for locally initiated
     audits. For CDA application the local audit office will notify the base gatekeeper, and
     the CDA management team will notify the MAJCOM gatekeepers. AFAA maintains
     MAJCOM gatekeeper addresses on the AFAA Home CoP. Gatekeepers will screen the
     audit announcement memorandum against upcoming deployments, exercises, and
     inspections. Note: When auditing ANG activities, do not send the announcement
     memorandum to the ANG gatekeeper.
        2.4.1.2.1. Provide the audit announcement only to the MAJCOM gatekeeper
        responsible for the unit audited. For example, if the audit will occur at an Air Combat
        Command tenant unit located on an Air Mobility Command installation, provide the
        audit announcement to the Air Combat Command gatekeeper, not the Air Mobility
        Command gatekeeper.
        2.4.1.2.2. Provide the audit announcement memorandum to gatekeepers concurrently
        with sending it to the auditee.
        2.4.1.2.3. If advised that a scheduled audit conflicts with a deployment, exercise, or
        inspection, the AAO should consider postponing or canceling the audit or selecting
        alternate units.
        2.4.1.2.4. AAOs should also be sensitive to unusual workload demands in
        organizations that do not directly support flying missions, such as buying centers
        (e.g., a source selection or an upcoming major program review). Consider deferring
        scheduled audits until a later date in these unusual circumstances.
     2.4.1.3. Announcement Memorandum Considerations.
        2.4.1.3.1. Air National Guard. AAOs should use the procedures described below on
        ANG-related assignments. In addition, auditors should review the Quick Reference
        Guide for Auditing Within Air National Guard Units on the AFAA Home CoP prior
        to the start of each audit involving an ANG activity.
            2.4.1.3.1.1. Coordinate new audit assignments with the state U.S. Property and
            Fiscal Office Internal Review (USPFO-IR) staff to avoid duplicating work the
            internal review staff has already accomplished. For work planned but not
            accomplished, AFAA takes precedence if the circumstances dictate.
            2.4.1.3.1.2. In addition to the normal requirements for an audit announcement
            memorandum, include planned visit dates. Coordinate subsequent changes to
            planned visit dates with the affected local and state units and advise the USPFO.
            2.4.1.3.1.3. Forward (e-mail) the audit announcement memorandum to the unit
            commander, the USPFO, the State Adjutant General, the Executive Support Staff
            Officer, the ANG audit focal point (ANG/FMFP), and others requiring
            notification as coordinated with local ANG personnel and the unit commander.
            Provide sufficient lead time (at least 2 weeks) of an audit visit.
            2.4.1.3.1.4. If the element of surprise is required, the AAO chief should notify
14                                                      AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


             ANG/FMFP by telephone as soon as the audit starts, followed by an audit
             announcement memo.
         2.4.1.3.2. Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency
         (AFISRA). An AFISRA unit must advise HQ AFISRA by priority message of any
         contact or visit by auditors. HQ AFISRA, in turn, normally contacts AFAA/SPO-C
         for additional information. Prior to contacting or starting audit work at an AFISRA
         unit, provide AFAA/SPO-C with a copy of the audit announcement memorandum.
         2.4.1.3.3. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). Provide the AFRC and responsible
         numbered Air Force audit focal points a copy of the audit announcement
         memorandum. The e-mail addresses of MAJCOM and numbered Air Force audit
         focal points are on the AFAA Home CoP in the MAJCOM gatekeepers listing.
         2.4.1.3.4. Other DoD Organizations. HQ      AFAA/DOO        is    responsible   for
         coordinating all contacts with other defense organizations (e.g., Defense Logistics
         Agency and Defense Finance and Accounting Service). When providing or requiring
         audit support, contact HQ AFAA/DOO for current coordination policies and
         procedures.
  2.4.2. Audit In-brief. The auditor and team chief will offer to conduct an entrance
  conference with the commander (or the commander’s designated representative) prior to
  beginning the audit.
     2.4.2.1. Auditors will inform the commander of the audit purpose and scope, including
     the overall and specific objectives, and identify the estimated time period of the audit.
     2.4.2.2. In-brief key personnel in the chain of command of the audited entity and other
     operating officials who have an interest in the audit.
     2.4.2.3. Ask the commander and other unit officials if they have any recommendations
     regarding the scope and objectives of the audit.
     2.4.2.4. Ask the commander and other unit officials if there are any reports and data they
     use in determining the audited activity’s general health and assessing how well the
     activity is managed. If there are, arrange to obtain copies. Reference paragraph 2.5.6
     2.4.2.5. Document the results of each in-brief meeting in a related procedures step.
  2.4.3. Preliminary Research. Auditors will perform preliminary research to familiarize
  themselves with the subject and prepare for data gathering.
     2.4.3.1. Identify and review Air Force, MAJCOM, and local instructions. They provide
     good sources of background information, identify internal controls, and explain
     operational requirements.
     2.4.3.2. Review reports issued by other offices covering the subject area posted on the
     AFAA Home CoP. If pertinent reports are found, the auditor may contact the applicable
     team chief and request copies of the audit program if the audit program is not already
     available on the AFAA Home CoP.
  2.4.4. Independence Statement. All audit team members (auditor, technical expert,
  statistician, independent referencer, team chief, and office chief) will sign the most current
  independence statement at the beginning of each fiscal year (or upon initial project
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                   15


   assignment for new employees). The most current independence statement template is
   included on the AFAA Home CoP. The auditor-in-charge is responsible for ensuring a copy
   of each audit team member’s independence statement is filed in the project file. For
   additional independence statement guidance, see AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 8.
2.5. Planning—Research. Auditors will gather basic background information, review prior
audit coverage, perform limited tests to identify potential exceptions, identify and evaluate
internal controls, assess the risk of fraud, identify management performance standards (metrics),
identify computer-processed data that will be used in the audit, and obtain input from other
organizations.
   2.5.1. Basic Information of the Audited Entity. Acquire the following information, as
   applicable: primary and subordinate missions or functions, budget and resource information,
   organizational structure and personnel assigned, and operating instructions and other
   supplemental criteria.
   2.5.2. Prior Audit Coverage. Review prior audit coverage by AFAA; the Office of the
   Inspector General, Department of Defense (DoD OIG); Government Accountability Office
   (GAO); or public accounting firms (may be applicable to non-appropriated fund and financial
   audits) within the last 5 years from the start of the current audit. If prior audit reports are
   identified for the application site, obtain copies of the pertinent reports. Auditors must
   follow up and report on recommendations made to the audited management level and
   location in prior reports if the recommendations relate to the current audit objectives. To
   identify prior audits:
       2.5.2.1. Review office working paper files.
       2.5.2.2. Search the AFAA report files on the AFAA Home CoP and in the DAMIS
       Corporate View.
       2.5.2.3. Ask the audit client or the applicable audit focal point.
   2.5.3. Potential Exceptions. Perform limited testing, as appropriate, to identify potential
   problems and their causes and effect. Do not identify potential exceptions without also
   attempting to identify potential causes and effect. Causes will often relate to ineffective
   internal controls, including lack of oversight and noncompliance.
   2.5.4. Internal Controls. GAO standards require auditors to review and evaluate internal
   controls during all audits. The purpose is to determine if the established controls (a) are
   working as intended and (b) provide reasonable assurance of detecting or preventing errors,
   irregularities, inefficiencies, or uneconomical practices.
       2.5.4.1. Identify Internal Controls. During the planning phase, the auditor will identify
       the internal controls (processes and procedures) established and implemented to account
       for and protect assets, assure accurate reporting, and efficiently and effectively
       accomplish the mission of the activity under review. This step is normally accomplished
       through review of regulations and OIs, discussions with managers and operating
       personnel, physical inspection, review of internal control reports (assessments performed
       to meet the requirements of the Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act), and reviews of
       prior audit reports. The five GAO standards for internal controls as outlined in GAO
       Internal Control Management and Evaluation Tool, GAO-01-1008G, August 2001, are
16                                                      AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


     control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication,
     and monitoring. Reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 7, for additional details on
     indentifying internal controls.
     2.5.4.2. Flowchart Controls. The auditor must gain an understanding of the activity’s
     control environment and flow of transactions. Flowcharts assist in this process by
     providing a graphic portrayal of the operation, and they help the auditor visualize and
     comprehend the activity’s work processes. Flowcharts are also beneficial in evaluating
     the adequacy of controls; therefore, use flowcharts whenever feasible. However, use of
     flowcharting is not practicable in every instance. Time constraints and the size and
     complexity of the activity are factors the auditor considers before deciding to use
     flowcharts. When the auditor does not use flowcharts, a written narrative will suffice.
     2.5.4.3. Test Controls. During the planning phase, auditors will perform limited tests to
     assess compliance with established controls and to form a preliminary opinion on their
     effectiveness. These tests will help the auditor determine the nature, timing, and extent
     of any additional detailed audit tests deemed necessary.
         2.5.4.3.1. If the auditor concludes controls are adequate, he or she should reduce the
         extent of detailed testing during the application phase.
         2.5.4.3.2. Conversely, if the auditor doubts the reliability of controls or elements
         thereof, the auditor should accomplish further in-depth audit work in the areas
         identified.
  2.5.5. Fraud. While reviewing controls, the auditor must be alert to situations or transactions
  that could be indicative of fraud (errors, irregularities, and illegal acts). When auditing in
  areas with high potential for fraud, the auditor should review the ―Fraud Indicators in
  Procurement and Other Defense Activities‖ link on the DoD OIG website as well as discuss
  the audit with local AFOSI personnel. The warning signals discussed below will assist the
  auditor in identifying potentially fraudulent situations.
     2.5.5.1. Difficulty in Obtaining Evidence. This includes difficulty in obtaining audit
     evidence with respect to unusual or unexplained transactions, incomplete or missing
     documentation and authorizations, and alterations in documentation or accounts.
     2.5.5.2. Inadequate Controls. Noncompliance and lack of oversight are two important
     control-related problems that would allow fraud to occur without detection.
     2.5.5.3. Unexplained Fluctuations. Unusual or unexplained fluctuations in material
     account balances, physical inventories, and inventory turnover rates.
     2.5.5.4. Performance Problems. Encountered performance problems such as delay
     tactics or evasive or unreasonable responses to audit inquiries.
     2.5.5.5. Dispersed Locations. Widely dispersed locations accompanied by highly
     decentralized management and inadequate reporting systems.
     2.5.5.6. Electronic Data Processing Weaknesses. Known continuing weaknesses in
     internal controls over access to computer equipment or electronic data entry devices.
  2.5.6. Metrics. Metrics are objective standards management uses to assess performance.
  These standards may be in the form of an error rate, on-time rate, operational readiness
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                  17


   rating, etc. Management’s success in achieving (or failure to achieve) the established metrics
   provides a prime indicator of the organization’s effectiveness. During the audit planning
   phase, the auditor should gather information regarding the identified metrics. Later, during
   the application phase, the auditor should determine if the metrics are correctly computed and
   accurately reported.
   2.5.7. Computer-Processed Data. GAO standards require that ―when computer-processed
   data are an important or integral part of the audit and the data’s reliability is crucial to
   accomplishing the audit objectives, auditors need to satisfy themselves that the data are
   relevant and reliable.‖ During the audit planning phase, auditors will identify the computer-
   processed data and reports they will rely on during the application phase to support audit
   conclusions. During audit application, auditors will test to verify the data’s reliability in
   accordance with AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 9 and GAO-09-680G, Assessing the Reliability of
   Computer-Processed Data.
   2.5.8. Input From Other Organizations. Evidence obtained from a credible third party may
   be more competent than that secured from the auditee. Also, organizations that work with
   the auditee often have a good understanding of the auditee’s strengths and weaknesses.
   Therefore, the auditor can generally benefit by obtaining input from personnel who interact
   with the auditee.
2.6. Planning—Working Paper Requirements. Auditors will plan, prepare, assemble, and
summarize audit planning working papers for every assigned audit project, including CDAs.
   2.6.1. Follow the specific procedures for uniform working paper organization and
   presentation required in AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6 and this instruction, paragraph 3.3
   2.6.2. Use the latest TeamMate library as specified in AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6.
   2.6.3. Beyond these procedures and requirements, auditors must use professional judgment
   and initiative in determining the manner of presentation.
2.7. Planning Exceptions. At the conclusion of the research portion of the planning phase, the
auditor will prepare the Go-No-Go procedure that summarizes the planning procedures and
provides rationale to conduct an in-depth audit or to terminate the audit without further audit
work. Include the following procedure results:
   2.7.1. Background Information. Provide sufficient detail to enable the team and office chief
   to understand the program, system, or function.
   2.7.2. Management Contacts. Identify the unit officials contacted during research and their
   suggestions related to the audit scope, if any.
   2.7.3. Control and Fraud Assessment. Document procedures accomplished to formulate a
   preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of established controls, including an assessment
   of the risk of abuse or illegal acts (fraud).
   2.7.4. Computer-Processed Data. Identify the computer-processed data that will be used
   during the review to support audit conclusions, if any.
   2.7.5. Prior Audits. Provide an assessment of the effects of previous audits with similar
   objectives on the proposed review, if any.
 18                                                       AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


   2.7.6. Research Results. Identify potential exceptions: condition, cause, effect, criteria, and
   PMB, if any.
   2.7.7. Rationale to Continue or Terminate the Audit.
       2.7.7.1. Continuing the Audit. Recommend conducting further audit work if (a)
       planning-phase results indicate the audit subject is sufficiently material or (b) planning-
       phase tests identified potential problems. The summary should estimate the time required
       to complete the audit and provide proposed completion dates for each audit phase.
       2.7.7.2. Terminating the Audit. Recommend terminating the audit if (a) the audit subject
       is not sufficiently material and (b) planning-phase tests do not identify potential
       problems.
           2.7.7.2.1. A report should be issued at the end of planning if the auditor
           accomplished sufficient work during planning to support any statement made in the
           report. Qualify the audit scope to ensure readers are fully aware of the limited testing
           done. Chapter 4 provides guidance for issuing installation-level audit reports.
           2.7.7.2.2. If the audit team decides not to issue an audit report, issue a closure
           memorandum to the applicable commander and reference the announcement
           memorandum previously submitted in accordance with paragraph 2.4.1 The closure
           memorandum should be independently referenced when there are details, facts, or
           figures contained in the memorandum. Advise the commander why the audit work
           was terminated, and explain that an audit report will not be issued. Provide the
           closure memorandum to offices that received the audit announcement memorandum
           and others that attended the entrance conference.
   2.7.8. Hyperlinks. The auditor will hyperlink (cross-reference) all pertinent elements of the
   planning procedures to supporting documentation.
2.8. Audit Program. The auditor must prepare a written audit program before starting any in-
depth audit work. Team chiefs will review the program for adequacy and approve the program
before the auditor starts audit testing. The program must provide understandable audit objectives
(purpose) and a series of program steps (procedures) that will reasonably accomplish each
objective. Reference the Local Audit Planning Program.
   2.8.1. General Guidelines.
       2.8.1.1. The audit program will identify the objectives of the audit and provide a
       systematic series of audit procedures, tests, or steps to answer each objective.
           2.8.1.1.1. Gather sufficient, appropriate evidence to convince a reasonable person of
           the validity of the audit results. The amount and type of audit testing and evidence
           gathering depends upon the judgment of the auditor and team chief. For additional
           information, reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 9.
           2.8.1.1.2. Design audit tests and data gathering procedures to facilitate subsequent
           summarization and reporting. Using spreadsheets and tables will greatly aid in
           summarizing data. Planning for summarization and reporting during program
           development will reduce the time needed to complete the audit. Note: If the auditor
           develops spreadsheets or databases for use in the audit program, the team chief should
           (during subsequent working paper reviews) perform basic internal consistency and
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                  19


         logic checks to verify the accuracy of worksheet formulas and calculations or to test
         the logic used in making database queries.
     2.8.1.2. Follow-up Audits. When an audit’s objective is to follow up on a prior report,
     limit the scope of the follow-up audit to the specific recommendations the prior audit
     team selected for follow up. Do not necessarily follow up on every recommendation in
     the prior report, and do not include audit tests to explore related issues that were not
     covered in the prior audit.
     2.8.1.3. Whenever possible, the auditor should use computer assisted auditing tools and
     techniques (CAATTs) to obtain a 100 percent data download and draw conclusions for
     the entire population. Reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 11.
     2.8.1.4. When evaluating the entire population is not feasible, use sampling, if possible,
     to accomplish the audit objectives and to maximize use of available audit resources.
     Select samples statistically whenever possible. Use of statistical sampling is essential
     when the need exists to estimate PMB or the extent of an error within an entire audited
     entity. Refer to AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 11, for additional guidance on sampling. If
     sampling is used:
         2.8.1.4.1. Clearly identify the sampling plan and data requirements.
         2.8.1.4.2. Include guidance on selection parameters and number of items for testing
         in the audit program.
         2.8.1.4.3. Refer questions on sampling plans to Agency statisticians at March ARB.
  2.8.2. Potential Exceptions. Include audit steps addressing suspected problems, probable
  causes, and resulting effect. Design tests to determine:
     2.8.2.1. Condition. Gather sufficient, appropriate evidence to support a conclusion on
     each suspected problem identified in the planning phase and to determine the extent of
     the problem.
     2.8.2.2. Cause. Determine the cause of identified problems. Causes will frequently
     relate to control problems (paragraph 2.8.5) such as inadequate procedures, guidance,
     oversight, or training. Steps should seek to identify the root cause. For example, it is not
     sufficient to tell management that personnel were not complying with a particular
     requirement--this is not the root cause. Management also needs to know if employees
     lacked familiarity with the requirement; did not have time to complete the requirement
     due to higher priorities; or lacked training to complete the requirement. Management
     may contribute to the problem by failing to provide oversight, assigning too few staff to a
     task, or underemphasizing the importance of a task.
     2.8.2.3. Effect. Quantify the effect of deficient conditions. Whenever possible, design
     steps to capture ―real‖ instead of ―potential‖ effect.
  2.8.3. Management’s Issues. Include audit tests that provide coverage of management’s
  suggested issues or concerns, if applicable.
  2.8.4. Prior Audits. Include audit steps to follow up on the prior audit results and
  recommendations if, during planning, the auditor identifies prior audit coverage
  corresponding to the audit objectives of the current audit.
20                                                      AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


     2.8.4.1. Audit steps should be sufficient to determine if management took the indicated
     corrective action and the action corrected the deficiency. If the condition still exists, the
     steps should be sufficient to fully develop a ―repeat‖ exception. The degree of support
     for repeat exceptions (or to clear exceptions) is the same as AFAA requires in all audits.
     2.8.4.2. Include steps to confirm the amount of PMB realized, if applicable.
     Unfortunately, auditors frequently cannot trace changes in requirements and/or budgets to
     actual hard documentation to ascertain the extent that a benefit actually occurred.
     However, auditors can validate PMB when management makes a collection or billing or
     cancels a contract or purchase request.
     2.8.4.3. When applicable, fully document why follow up was not necessary or
     accomplished on the exceptions and recommendations in prior audits with similar
     objectives.
  2.8.5. Internal Controls. The audit program will include audit steps to test the effectiveness
  of and compliance with the significant controls identified in planning research. The amount
  of testing will vary from audit to audit and depend on the amount of control-related work
  accomplished during research and the importance of controls to the objectives of the audit.
  Generally, the auditor will perform sufficient testing to ensure the controls in place are
  consistently applied. The following provides guidance to use in assessing controls.
     2.8.5.1. Personnel. Are a sufficient number of technically competent employees
     assigned to accomplish the tasks, and have employees received adequate formal and on-
     the-job training?
     2.8.5.2. Documentation. Are transactions and other significant events clearly
     documented, promptly recorded, and properly classified? Is the documentation readily
     available for examination?
     2.8.5.3. Authorization. Are transactions and other significant events properly authorized
     and executed only by persons acting within the scope of their authority?
     2.8.5.4. Separation of Duties. Are key duties in authorizing, processing, recording, and
     reviewing transactions separated among individuals?
     2.8.5.5. Safeguarding and Access. Is access to resources and records limited to
     authorized individuals, and is accountability for resources assigned? Are resources
     periodically reconciled to accountability records?
     2.8.5.6. Computer Systems. For computer-processed data, are system application
     controls in place, are procedures documented for entering data into the computer system,
     and is access to the computer system controlled?
     2.8.5.7. Oversight. Is qualified and continuous oversight provided to ensure personnel
     comply with existing controls and internal control objectives are achieved?
     2.8.5.8. Compliance. If the system has a process to detect errors, perform sufficient
     testing to satisfy yourself that the process has been implemented. If the system requires a
     separation of duties, verify that one person does not have access to all steps of the
     process. If a process requires approval, perform sufficient testing to ensure the proper
     individuals are reviewing the task before providing the approval.
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                 21


   2.8.6. Fraud and Illegal Acts. Include steps which provide reasonable assurance for
   detecting fraud when auditing in areas where the potential for fraud exists and (a) planning-
   phase audit tests indicated the existing controls were not effective or lacked compliance, or
   (b) controls were not tested in the planning phase. High risk areas for fraud, illegal acts,
   waste and abuse include: labor costs, billing systems and related reviews, indirect costs,
   contracting, in theatre operations, travel, payroll, worker’s compensation, asset
   misappropriation, base allowance for housing, retail operations, and the purchase card
   program.
   2.8.7. Metrics. Verify the accuracy of any metrics identified during planning (paragraphs
   2.4.2.4 and 2.5.6). Include steps in the program to determine if:
      2.8.7.1. Unit personnel computed the metrics correctly. This involves confirming the
      documentation is complete and accurate and the metric calculations are accurate.
      2.8.7.2. Unit personnel reported the metrics accurately. This involves performing
      sufficient testing to determine if the metric calculations were accurately and completely
      reported to management.
   2.8.8. Tests of Computer-Processed Data. Government auditing standards require auditors
   to determine the reliability of computer-processed data when the data is crucial to
   accomplishing the audit objectives. Consequently, whenever an auditor relies on computer-
   processed data and reports as evidence to support an audit result, the audit program must
   include tests to verify the accuracy of the data and reports. Note: If auditors use the
   computer-processed data only for background or informational purposes, citing the source of
   the data is sufficient. Refer to AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 9, and GAO-09-680G, Assessing the
   Reliability of Computer-Processed Data, for additional information on data testing methods
   and associated reporting.
      2.8.8.1. The two types of data testing methods are auditing around the computer
      (manual) and auditing with the computer (automated). While the auditor may use either
      method, or a combination of both, the manual method is the most common method used
      to test data reliability in installation-level audits.
      2.8.8.2. Sufficient testing will be accomplished and specific work performed
      documented to allow the auditor to reach a conclusion regarding data reliability.
2.9. Centrally Directed Audit Program. The centrally directed audit program (CDAP) is
applicable to audit projects intended to produce an Air Force-level audit report.
   2.9.1. AFAAI 65-102, Centrally Directed Audits, Chapter 2, requires audit managers to
   include appropriate CDAP steps for planning the local audits. If the CDAP does not include
   planning-phase steps, immediately contact the audit manager and ask him or her to add
   appropriate planning steps to the CDAP.
   2.9.2. The TeamMate CDA Library includes a Standardized CDAP template. AFAAI
   65102 requires audit managers to use the standardized CDAP.
      2.9.2.1. The CDAP transmittal memorandum will identify (a) audit purpose, (b) audit
      objectives, (c) audit team responsibilities, (d) general guidance, (e) instructions for
      developing and reporting audit exceptions, and (f) policies for contacting the audit
      manager to report audit progress and seek technical assistance.
22                                                     AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


     2.9.2.2. Chapter 1 will provide planning steps for the local audits and include steps to
     obtain information that will later appear in the scope sections of the local audit reports.
     The remaining chapters will address the announced subobjectives. Each major
     subobjective will normally be in a separate CDAP chapter.
     2.9.2.3. Field auditors will respond to CDAPs using the standard format sent to them by
     audit managers. Responding to CDAPs in the standardized format will help in
     supervisory reviews as well as audit control point summarization.
  2.9.3. Auditors applying CDAPs will not start the application phase prior to the date shown
  on the Project Plan Report without audit manager approval. Further, auditors will follow the
  guidance in AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 4, if it becomes necessary to exceed the milestones and
  resources authorized in the Project Plan Report.
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                      23


                                            Chapter 3

                     AUDIT APPLICATION AND SUMMARIZATION

3.1. Overview. This chapter identifies application-phase responsibilities and provides guidance
auditors will use to gather data and prepare detail working papers, summarize the audit results,
document the work accomplished to assess controls and verify data reliability, and validate the
audit results with management.
3.2. Application Responsibilities.
   3.2.1. The office chief will:
       3.2.1.1. During working paper reviews (paragraph 1.3.1.8), verify the audit application
       phase was conducted in accordance with government auditing standards and AFAA
       policies and procedures.
       3.2.1.2. Monitor audit progress and performance, and provide guidance and assistance as
       necessary.
       3.2.1.3. Evaluate, then approve or disapprove, requests for deviations from established
       audit project milestones, resources, and objectives.
   3.2.2. The team chief will:
       3.2.2.1. Supervise and guide the auditor through the audit application phase.
       3.2.2.2. Discuss application results with the auditor on a frequent, recurring basis and
       document discussions with TeamMate coaching notes.
       3.2.2.3. Review exceptions and procedures periodically during the application phase, and
       document the review with TeamMate coaching notes. Complete the team chief reviews
       before providing the draft audit report to the office chief for review and approval.
           3.2.2.3.1. During working paper reviews, team chiefs will spot-check table and
           spreadsheet footings and extensions for accuracy.
           3.2.2.3.2. For any comments, questions, and directions documented with TeamMate
           coaching notes, the team chief should follow up and initial that the auditor’s reply
           comments are responsive.
       3.2.2.4. Provide the office chief periodic project status reports, briefings, or other locally
       developed reports advising of audit progress and results. The office chief will determine
       the reporting frequency.
       3.2.2.5. Evaluate and elevate to the office chief requests for deviations from established
       audit project milestones, resources, and objectives.
       3.2.2.6. Evaluate identified problems (e.g., information access, disagreements with audit
       managers on CDA issues) and either resolve or elevate the problem to the office chief.
       Note: For information access problems, see AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 18.
       3.2.2.7. Evaluate and decide interim audit reporting needs (e.g., quick reaction or
       preliminary report).
 24                                                      AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


       3.2.2.8. For CDA submissions, certify the CDAP Response Sheet data in accordance
       with AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 4.
   3.2.3. The auditor will:
       3.2.3.1. Conduct the audit in accordance with government auditing standards and AFAA
       policies and procedures (AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 8).
       3.2.3.2. Apply each step in the audit program and collect sufficient, appropriate
       evidence, in accordance with AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 9, to answer all audit objectives
       and support the audit conclusions.
       3.2.3.3. Keep the team chief informed on how the audit is progressing, and notify the
       team chief of any results requiring possible action. It may be necessary, for example, to
       reduce or terminate work on one objective, expand work on another objective, or issue an
       interim report.
       3.2.3.4. Prepare working papers to document the work performed in accordance with
       paragraphs 3.3 through 3.5 Also, reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6 and Attachments 6
       and 7.
       3.2.3.5. Respond to the team chief’s TeamMate coaching notes, answering questions and
       providing brief explanations of actions taken.
3.3. Working Paper Requirements. Auditors will use the latest TeamMate library to establish
current files for each audit project. In addition, they will install the AFAA Toolkit. The use of
electronic working papers greatly reduces the requirement to print and manually store audit
working papers and significantly enhances the summarization and review processes. Manually
prepared working papers will only be used on an exception basis, such as when accomplishing a
classified audit without secure computer support. In addition to the following paragraphs,
AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6 and Attachments 6 and 7, provide important criteria for preparing
working papers.
   3.3.1. TeamMate Snapshot. The TeamMate Snapshot provides an overview of the status of
   all audit steps (procedures) and supporting documents and exhibits.
   3.3.2. General Requirements. Organize working papers to facilitate supervisory review and
   ensure subsequent reviewers can easily follow the auditor’s logic and find support for the
   audit results. The auditor must provide the team chief and independent referencer with a
   road map through the working papers that clearly shows all steps taken in the audit process.
       3.3.2.1. All audit support must be attached to a procedure step that contains purpose,
       source, details, and conclusion (PSDC). It is no longer necessary to include PSDC
       information on each supporting working paper, as long as said documents are linked to
       procedures. Reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6, for detailed information on PSDC
       working paper requirements.
       3.3.2.2. Hyperlink files following the guidance in AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6. Generally
       speaking, hyperlinking requirements for TeamMate are the same as cross-referencing
       requirements for AFAA electronic working papers and manually prepared working
       papers. However, TeamMate accomplishes much of the linking automatically, so there is
       less for the auditor to do. Note: Do not hyperlink to web-based documents when it is
       possible to download the documents to your computer and hyperlink to the downloaded
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                     25


       documents. Web addresses and documents on the web constantly change. Further,
       always hyperlink to files that are part of the current project file structure. Hyperlinks to
       documents outside the current project file structure will not work after the project files
       are saved on a CD-ROM diskette or other external storage device.
   3.3.3. Supervisory Review. Team chiefs will review all working papers in accordance with
   supervisory review requirements contained in AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6; use TeamMate
   coaching notes to specify the working papers reviewed; indicate the dates they reviewed the
   specified working papers; and record review questions, taskings, and overall comments (both
   favorable and unfavorable). Also, the team chief must electronically sign each auditor-
   prepared electronic working paper file. At a minimum, the team chief will perform and
   document project oversight every 2 to 3 weeks for experienced auditors and more frequently
   for less experienced auditors.
       3.3.3.1. Auditors will respond to all TeamMate coaching notes.
       3.3.3.2. For TeamMate coaching notes that require a response, the team chief should
       follow up and indicate whether the auditor’s reply comments are responsive (i.e., they
       adequately address the issues the team chief raised) and then clear the coaching note.
   3.3.4. File Maintenance. TeamMate projects will automatically backup daily. Audit teams
   may also elect to perform additional backups manually. To prevent accidental data loss,
   auditors will backup electronic files on a CD, DVD, server, or other storage device in
   accordance with directorate policy. Backup and primary locations should be different
   storage mediums (i.e., primary and backup files should not be stored on the same device).
   After the audit is completed and the final report is issued, the auditor will store (archive) the
   working papers in accordance with instructions in AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 5. Note: AFAAI
   65-103, Chapter 5, also provides guidance for marking and safeguarding (a) classified, For
   Official Use Only, personally identifiable information (to include Privacy Act data), and
   fraud-related working papers; and (b) labeling, password protecting, and retaining working
   papers.
   3.3.5. Changing Archived Files. Changes to archived working paper files are not permitted
   for any reason. If the need arises to add or modify archived working paper files, the audit
   team will create a separate project folder named ―Post-Audit Adjustments‖ in accordance
   with the instructions provided in the AFAA TeamMate User’s Guide
   3.3.6. Manual Working Papers. Manual working papers should rarely be used. However, if
   manual working papers are deemed necessary, record complete identification data on the first
   page of each working paper (Activity, Project Number, Installation, Auditor, Date, Reviewer,
   Working Paper Title, Page Number, and Index). When you have more than one page of a
   working paper with the same index and working paper title, you may omit entries in the
   ―Activity,‖ ―Working Paper Title,‖ and ―Installation‖ blocks from all subsequent pages of the
   working paper. Manual working papers must be referenced in the electronic TeamMate files
   (via a ―manual working paper‖ procedure) to indicate the additional supporting
   documentation exists.
3.4. Procedure Responses. Procedures contain responses to all audit program steps and any
other data the auditor needs to build a firm, evidential structure on which to base audit results,
 26                                                        AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


their causes and effects, and related recommendations. Reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6, for
procedure and exception requirements.
3.5. Validating Audit Results. The auditor will discuss (validate) audit results with
management while conducting the audit--and not wait to the end of the audit. Early validation
will assist the auditor in obtaining management’s concurrence with the audit conclusions and
will provide operating personnel the opportunity to correct the identified problems before the
audit is completed. The auditor will:
   3.5.1. Meet face-to-face with unit working personnel throughout the audit and prior to
   issuing a draft report for management comments to validate the accuracy of audit data and
   conclusions. If unit personnel believe the audit conclusions are inaccurate or the auditor has
   misinterpreted specific data, the auditor should conduct additional audit tests, as necessary, to
   re-verify the data’s accuracy and reassess the accuracy of the conclusions.
   3.5.2. Discuss proposed recommendations with management during validation discussions.
   If the auditor and management officials agree on a course of action that will correct the
   identified problems, then management can begin work during the audit to implement the
   agreed-to actions. If management completes action and corrects the problem during the
   audit, the auditor should note this achievement in the audit report.
   3.5.3. Conduct additional audit tests, as necessary, or examine documentary evidence to
   determine the validity of management officials’ statements that may affect the context,
   perspective, or accuracy of audit results.
   3.5.4. Document validation discussions in the working papers using a discussion memo or
   similar form.
3.6. Headquarters Issues Identified at Installation Level. If an installation-level condition
requires MAJCOM or HQ USAF management attention, the following procedures apply:
   3.6.1. MAJCOM Issue. The office chief will contact the appropriate AFAA MAJCOM
   representative and advise of the issue involved. If the office chief and representative agree
   the issue is significant, the office chief will forward all related working papers and draft audit
   results to the representative.
       3.6.1.1. The AFAA representative will decide the best approach for evaluating and
       processing the issue to the MAJCOM functional office of primary responsibility and keep
       the office chief informed of actions taken. If the issue cannot be resolved at MAJCOM
       level, the representative will forward all data to the appropriate CDA directorate for
       review and further action.
       3.6.1.2. The related installation-level report will normally contain the audit results and
       identify the elevated issue.
   3.6.2. HQ USAF Issue. The office chief will forward all data to the appropriate associate
   director for review and determination of action (e.g., forward to HQ USAF or include in a
   CDA). The associate director will initiate action based on the significance and urgency of
   the issue. The associate director will provide copies of all correspondence relating to the
   resolution to the appropriate region and involved AAO.
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                  27


   3.6.3. Auditors Applying CDAPs. Forward all issues identified to the audit manager. The
   audit manager will forward issues requiring MAJCOM or HQ USAF action that are beyond
   the scope of the CDA to the appropriate associate director for action.
3.7. Referencing CDAP Response Sheet Data. The team chief will assign a qualified auditor
(paragraph 4.8.2.2) not associated with the audit to independently reference all CDAP Response
Sheet data and supporting schedules.
   3.7.1. When independent referencing is completed, the team chief will e-mail the audit
   manager a document certifying an independent referencer verified the CDAP Response Sheet
   data. The auditor will retain an electronic copy of the e-mail in the working paper files. The
   team chief may use a certification memo, the Independent Referencer Certification Package,
   or a verification email. Applicable TeamMate templates and reports are provided for
   convenience.
   3.7.2. The independent referencer will complete work before the audit team submits the
   CDAP Response Sheet data to the audit manager. The independent referencer should
   reference all procedure steps. If the auditor provides data to the audit manager periodically
   during the audit (e.g., at the end of each chapter), it is not necessary to independently
   reference the CDAP Response Sheet data until the audit is completed. In this case, the audit
   team will complete referencing and certify the results before submitting the final CDAP
   Response Sheets to the audit manager. Further, when exporting the AFAA CDAP Response
   Sheet in TeamMate, it is the equivalent of the ―clean copy‖ for the audit manager and it
   should not be linked and referenced again.
   3.7.3. The independent referencer will perform and document the work following the
   referencing procedures described in paragraph 4.8.2.5
 28                                                       AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


                                           Chapter 4

                                       DRAFT REPORT

4.1. Overview. Issue a report (either clear or with exceptions) on all audits, including audits
terminated at the end of the planning phase or curtailed prior to completing application, where
the auditor gathered sufficient, appropriate evidence to support an opinion. Auditors will use the
guidance in this chapter to prepare, process, issue, and assure the quality of installation-level
audit reports.
4.2. Report Responsibilities.
   4.2.1. The office chief will:
       4.2.1.1. Review each draft report and confirm the report is logically sound and the
       opinions, conclusions, and recommendations are reasonable, material, and consistent with
       the factual information presented. The office chief has the ultimate responsibility in
       ensuring the quality of the issued report.
       4.2.1.2. Approve each draft report for discussion and subsequent release. The office
       chief will not approve draft reports with PMB until region and HQ AFAA/DOO
       coordination is completed. Also, the office chief will not approve draft CDA-related
       reports until audit manager coordination is completed.
       4.2.1.3. Review a sample of reports periodically to verify compliance with AFAA
       quality assurance procedures (e.g., cross referencing and independent referencing).
       Provide feedback on the reviews to the team chiefs and auditors.
   4.2.2. The team chief will:
       4.2.2.1. Monitor auditor progress in completing draft reports and assure reports are
       completed in a timely manner. Keep the office chief informed on progress in completing
       the draft report.
       4.2.2.2. Review and ensure draft reports meet government auditing standards and AFAA
       policies and procedures (reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 8). Record review comments
       electronically on draft reports (using the ―track changes‖ and ―comments‖ features of
       Microsoft Word) or with TeamMate coaching notes.
       4.2.2.3. Elevate finished draft reports to the office chief for discussion and release
       approval. The team chief and auditor share responsibility for the accuracy, validity, and
       quality of the draft report submitted to the office chief for review.
       4.2.2.4. Ensure the auditor thoroughly cross references the approved draft (the report the
       office chief approves for discussion and release) to exceptions and procedures, as
       appropriate.
       4.2.2.5. Ensure a qualified auditor independently references the draft report before
       discussing the report with management. Attest to the satisfactory completion of all
       independent referencer suggestions and/or comments using TeamMate coaching notes.
       4.2.2.6. Attend report out-briefings with the auditor to the maximum extent possible.
       Note: The team chief must consider the skill level and experience of the auditor in
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                   29


      determining which briefings to attend. At a minimum, the team chief should attend all
      out-briefings at the group commander level and above. If it is not possible for the team
      chief to attend, appoint an acting team chief to attend.
      4.2.2.7. Sign the draft report transmittal memorandum (standard processing–paragraph
      4.9.1.3).
      4.2.2.8. Ensure distribution of draft reports meets the requirements of Attachment 2
      (standard distribution) and Attachments 3 and 4 (special distribution).
   4.2.3. The auditor will:
      4.2.3.1. Prepare the draft report in accordance with government auditing standards and
      AFAA policies and procedures. The assigned auditor has primary responsibility for the
      accuracy, validity, and quality of the original draft report submitted for review and shares
      responsibility with the team chief for all subsequent revisions.
      4.2.3.2. Thoroughly cross-reference the office chief-approved draft report to exceptions
      and procedures.
      4.2.3.3. Provide the cross-referenced draft report and exceptions and procedures to the
      assigned independent referencer for verification, and answer the independent referencer’s
      coaching notes.
      4.2.3.4. Out-brief the draft report with management, and revise the report as necessary
      based on the results of the discussions.
      4.2.3.5. Notify the team chief when making report changes that require re-referencing.
4.3. Report General Requirements.
   4.3.1. Report Criteria. Issue installation-level reports, or close projects without a report,
   according to the following criteria:
      4.3.1.1. Application Completed. Issue an audit report on all projects for which auditors
      completed audit application. Waivers from this requirement require region chief
      approval.
      4.3.1.2. Projects Cancelled During Application.
          4.3.1.2.1. Report. Issue an audit report on projects cancelled before completing audit
          application when sufficient work was performed to reach a conclusion.
          4.3.1.2.2. No Report. If sufficient work was not performed to reach a conclusion,
          obtain office chief approval to close the project without a report. Issue a closure
          memorandum to cancel the project following the guidance in paragraph 2.7.7.2.2 and
          update the AFAA MIS.
      4.3.1.3. Fact-Gathering Projects. Close out fact-gathering efforts (usually related to a
      CDA) with a memorandum addressed to the commander or chief of the functional area
      visited, as appropriate.
   4.3.2. Report Types. The AFAA issues two types of installation-level audit reports: regular
   and interim. In addition, auditors may report deficient conditions of less significance to
   managers and the commander in an Additional Results Memorandum or orally.
30                                                      AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


     4.3.2.1. Regular Reports. The most commonly issued report is the regular report. Use
     regular reports to convey the results of AAO-initiated projects or CDAs that do not meet
     interim report criteria.
     4.3.2.2. Interim Reports. Issue interim reports while audits are in progress to bring
     urgent conditions to management’s immediate attention (quick reaction) or to keep
     management informed of conditions found in audits extending over a long period of time
     (preliminary).
         4.3.2.2.1. Send quick-reaction reports to management for comment with a 15calendar
         day suspense. Send preliminary reports to management for comments with a
         30calendar day suspense. Assign a separate project number to the interim report.
         4.3.2.2.2. At the conclusion of audits that included an interim report, the audit team
         will issue a standard report that summarizes the interim results in the body of the
         report (paragraph 4.4.1.2). In addition, the audit team will include the interim report
         verbatim as an appendix to the standard report.
     4.3.2.3. Additional Results Memorandum. Use the Additional Results Memorandum to
     report audit results that do not warrant inclusion in a report of audit but which may
     develop into significant problems if not corrected. Include a statement in the overall
     evaluation of the related audit report similar to the following: ―We noted certain
     conditions of less significance that we reported to the management of (name of entity) in
     a separate memorandum dated XXXXXXX.‖
  4.3.3. Report Format. The AFAA has two report formats: standard and memorandum. Use
  the standard format for regular reports--including clear reports. Use the memorandum format
  for interim reports. Projects that do not meet the criteria for a report should be closed out
  with a memorandum (paragraph 4.3.1.2.2). Do not deviate from the approved report formats
  without requesting HQ AFAA/DOO approval through the chain of command.
     4.3.3.1. Standard Report. The standard report format is described in paragraphs 4.4
     through 4.6, and the TeamMate library contains Standard Report and Standard Clear
     Report templates. Standard report segments include the executive summary, audit results
     tabs, and appendices.
         4.3.3.1.1. Attach a cover page to each report and insert a table of contents after the
         executive summary using the format specified in the templates.
         4.3.3.1.2. Include at least one tab in clear reports to identify the positive conditions
         noted in the audit. Note: Clear reports are reports that do not identify deficient
         conditions.
         4.3.3.1.3. Begin tabs that identify both deficient and positive conditions with the
         positive conditions first followed by the deficient conditions.
     4.3.3.2. Memorandum Report. The Memorandum Report format is described below and
     included in a TeamMate template.
         4.3.3.2.1. Introduction. Include an introductory paragraph that explains the need for
         an interim report, why the audit was accomplished, and the significance of the audited
         area.
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                    31


          4.3.3.2.2. Audit Objectives. Briefly address the audit’s overall objective and
          subobjectives. The objectives identified in this paragraph should be similar to, or the
          same as, the objectives shown in the audit announcement memorandum.
          4.3.3.2.3. Synopsis (Optional). The audit team is encouraged to include a synopsis if
          the memorandum report addresses more than one exception or contains one exception
          that is long and complex. If included, the synopsis will briefly summarize the
          report’s exceptions in the same order as they are discussed in the report.
          4.3.3.2.4. Background (Optional). Include information in the background paragraph
          that potential readers need to understand the audit results. Provide other background
          information, as appropriate, and the criteria used to conduct the audit in the audit
          methodology and disclosure attachment (paragraph 4.5.2).
          4.3.3.2.5. Audit Results. Number and title each audit result, and include the
          following captioned paragraphs:      condition, cause, effect, recommendations,
          management comments, and evaluation of management comments. In addition,
          include captioned paragraphs for management corrective actions and other audit
          comments if applicable. Follow the guidance for standard reports (paragraph 4.5.3).
          4.3.3.2.6. Discussion with Responsible Officials. In the interim report, include a
          paragraph stating with whom (by position title and organization) the audit team
          discussed or coordinated the report. In the final report, indicate the date you received
          management’s written comments (AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 15).
          4.3.3.2.7. Points of Contact Final Report Distribution. Identify the members of the
          audit team, offices that received the final report, and the AFAA MIS project number
          under which the audit was conducted.
          4.3.3.2.8. Audit Methodology and Prior Audit Coverage Attachment. Include  the
          following mandatory paragraphs: (a) criteria, (b) audit scope, (c) prior audit
          coverage, and (d) Freedom of Information Act in accordance with AFAAI 65-103,
          Chapter 14.
              4.3.3.2.8.1. Criteria. Identify guidance used to perform the audit.
              4.3.3.2.8.2. Audit Scope. Include the following paragraphs:           audit coverage,
              sampling methodology, data reliability, and auditing standards.
              4.3.3.2.8.3. Prior Audit Coverage. Identify prior reports in the prior audit
              coverage section that required follow-up work. If there were no audits with
              similar objectives, so state.
              4.3.3.2.8.4. Freedom of Information Act. Advise all report recipients as to the
              disclosure/denial authority by including the Freedom of Information Act
              statement.
4.4. Report Format-Executive Summary. The executive summary provides the reader a brief
overview of the audit and consists of five sections: introduction, objectives, conclusions,
recommendations, and management’s response.
   4.4.1. Introduction. The introduction section should be brief and provide only
   (a) information needed to understand the audit conclusions and (b) perspective on the
32                                                         AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


  magnitude of the audit entity. Provide additional background information in the tabs or
  Appendix I, as appropriate.
     4.4.1.1. For follow-up reports, identify the prior report number and date.
     4.4.1.2. If an interim report was issued, briefly synopsize the audit results reported in the
     interim report (exceptions, recommendations, and management actions).
  4.4.2. Objectives. In the objectives section, explain why the audit was performed and state
  the audit’s overall objective and major subobjectives. The objectives identified in this
  section should be similar to, or the same as, the objectives shown in the audit announcement
  memorandum. State the overall audit objective followed by the audit subobjectives. Note:
  For financial audits, include a stated objective to evaluate the internal control structure
  applicable to the audit subject area and identify the significant internal controls assessed,
  including controls established to ensure compliance with laws and regulations that have a
  material effect on the financial statements.
     4.4.2.1. If the audit was a request audit, the objectives paragraph should note this fact.
     4.4.2.2. The objectives paragraph should also indicate whether the report was locally
     initiated or centrally directed.
  4.4.3. Conclusions. The conclusions section should address the overall objective of the audit
  and the subobjectives in the order they are listed in the objectives section. Provide positive
  as well as negative audit results, and list the positive results first. Note: For reports that have
  a mix of clear and deficient conditions, it is sufficient to identify the clear conditions in the
  executive summary without further discussion in the tabs. For reports that do not have
  deficient conditions, include a tab in the report to address the clear conditions.
     4.4.3.1. The first sentence in the conclusion section main paragraph must contain a
     statement assessing the overall audit objective as stated in the objective paragraph.
     4.4.3.2. Succeeding subparagraphs will provide the audit results for each audit area
     (subobjective). For each audit result, include a results paragraph that briefly summarizes
     the condition and effect. At the end of each results paragraph, indicate where the
     discussion is located in the report (e.g., Tab A, page 1 or Tab B, page 7).
     4.4.3.3. Identify repeat deficiencies as ―repeat exceptions‖ along with the related report
     references. Reference paragraph 4.11.1.1
     4.4.3.4. If issuing an Additional Results Memorandum, refer to it in the overall
     evaluation paragraph as follows: ―We noted certain exceptions of less significance that
     we reported to management of the (name of entity) in a separate memorandum dated DD
     Month 20XX.‖
     4.4.3.5. For clear reports, provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the area had
     no deficiencies.
  4.4.4. Management Corrective Actions. This paragraph is optional. If desired, the audit
  team can use this paragraph to give management credit for the actions they already took to
  correct deficiencies the auditor identified during the audit. Keep the paragraph brief and
  conclude with the following statement: ―(Reference the individual Tabs for specific
  corrective actions.).‖
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                        33


   4.4.5. Recommendations. Indicate the number and general nature of the recommendations.
   At the end of the recommendations section, include the following advisory statement:
   ―(Reference the individual tabs for specific recommendations.).‖
   4.4.6. Management’s Response. In the draft report, insert ―MANAGEMENT’S
   RESPONSE‖ after the recommendations paragraph and leave blank until receipt of
   management comments. In the final report, indicate whether management agreed with the
   audit results, recommendations, and PMB included in the report. Also, indicate whether or
   not the management comments were responsive to the issues in the report. For clear reports
   (reports with no exceptions and/or recommendations), state that management agreed with the
   audit results (refer to AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 15).
4.5. Report Format-Tabs. All standard reports, including clear reports, will be tab reports.
Include each major audit result or group of related audit results in one tab. Normally group tabs
by subobjective and arrange tabs to put conditions in the order of their relative importance. Keep
tab titles as short as possible. Identify the subject for discussion rather than synopsize the results.
For instance, use ―Cash Controls‖ not ―Lack of Control Over Cash‖. Note: Use captions on
main segments, paragraphs, and subparagraphs as needed to draw the reader’s attention to
specific information. When used, boldface main paragraph captions and underline subparagraph
captions.
   4.5.1. Synopsis (Optional). The audit team is highly encouraged to include a synopsis in
   tabs that address more than one exception or contain one exception that is long and complex.
   If included, the synopsis will briefly summarize the tab’s exceptions (condition, cause, and
   effect) in the same order as they are discussed in the report. In multi-tab reports, if one tab
   contains a synopsis, it is not necessary for the remaining tabs to have a synopsis.
   4.5.2. Background (Optional). Limit the background paragraph, if used, to information
   needed to understand the audit results presented in the tab and criteria used to conduct the
   audit. Do not provide extraneous information that does not facilitate an understanding of the
   results section issues. Include such information in Appendix I. In multi-tab reports, if one
   tab contains a background paragraph, it is not necessary for the remaining tabs to have a
   background paragraph.
   4.5.3. Audit Results. Each audit result (i.e., exception) will be numbered and titled (if
   possible, limit the title to one line in length) and have the following captioned paragraphs:
   condition, cause, effect, management corrective actions (if applicable), audit comment (if
   applicable), recommendations, management comments, and evaluation of management
   comments. When determined appropriate, the order of the cause and effect paragraphs may
   be reversed. In addition, the audit results may also include captioned paragraphs for
   corrective actions management took during the audit and other audit comments. Note: For
   each negative audit results on the Summary of Audit Results (SAR) statement and AFAA
   MIS product module, there must be a local recommendation and/or corrective action
   completed during the audit.
       4.5.3.1. Condition. Include all necessary facts using specific examples or cases to
       demonstrate the condition, promote an adequate understanding of the matters reported,
       and provide convincing but fair presentations in proper perspective. Use tables or
       supporting schedules to provide detailed statistical data and provide the reader a greater
       understanding of and appreciation for the magnitude of the problem. Note: Do not use
34                                                     AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


     personal information, such as names or social security numbers, or other extraneous
     information in audit reports.
        4.5.3.1.1. The first (topic) sentence should focus the reader on the condition noted as
        well as the relative significance of the condition. Describe the condition found using
        past tense and active voice.
        4.5.3.1.2. Clearly explain the nature, extent, and frequency of the deficiencies.
        Include all necessary facts using specific examples or cases to demonstrate the
        deficiency. Use supporting schedules to provide detailed statistical data or show the
        problem’s magnitude. Identify locations where auditors found the condition. State to
        what extent (quantity, percentage, etc.) management deviated from the established
        standard.
        4.5.3.1.3. State exceptions clearly and concisely using nontechnical terms to the
        extent possible. Avoid the use of vague or imprecise terminology (e.g., some, not
        many, not always). Round numbers to enhance clarity of presentation. Also, avoid
        the use of lengthy paragraphs. Use subparagraphs and captions, when appropriate, to
        assist reader understanding.
     4.5.3.2. Cause. Identify the root cause first followed by the contributing causes. Provide
     the related criteria (if not already provided in the background). Do not include a negative
     cause for which there is no recommendation or completed management corrective action.
     For a clear results paragraph, there should only be a positive cause statement (if one is
     used).
        4.5.3.2.1. The root cause is normally weak or absent controls or reasons for
        noncompliance with existing controls. It is the situation or procedure which, when
        changed or corrected, will solve the problem or condition. If the activity needs to
        improve controls, so state. If personnel did not follow directives, explain why not.
        4.5.3.2.2. Causes will not be subjective (i.e., the auditor should not normally indicate
        lack of awareness, misinterpretation of guidance, operating personnel beliefs, etc.
        caused the problem). It should be clear the discrepant conditions noted in the audit
        could have occurred as a result of the cited causes.
     4.5.3.3. Effect. Express effect in terms of dollars or number of deficiencies in a
     population. If using statistical sampling, state the effect in terms of projected errors.
     State the effect in positive terms when possible, (e.g., ―eliminating the problem will
     provide benefits‖) instead of negative terms (e.g., ―failure to correct will create further
     problems‖).
        4.5.3.3.1. In performance audits, reductions in efficiency and economy or shortfalls
        in obtaining program objectives are appropriate measures of effect. Express these in
        quantitative terms such as dollars, number of personnel, units of production,
        quantities of material, number of transactions, or elapsed time.
        4.5.3.3.2. Provide specific examples when possible. If you cannot ascertain the
        actual effect, you can sometimes use potential or inferred effect to show the
        significance of the condition.
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                  35


        4.5.3.3.3. If PMB is identified, include the dollar amount in the audit results
        paragraph, and state how the PMB was determined. Make sure the PMB and amount
        agreed to by management is consistently presented throughout the report and agrees
        with the amount in the SAR (paragraph 4.7.). When using statistical sampling, state
        the effect in terms of projected errors (e.g., ―we estimate management processed
        between 800 and 1,000 of the 2,000 transactions late‖). Note: Coordinate all PMB
        with your region and HQ AFAA/DOO before discussing the report with management
        in accordance with AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 17.
            4.5.3.3.3.1. You may use a one-sided lower limit or both the lower and upper
            limit, but never the upper limit alone to establish effect, unless you do not require
            corrective action. When in doubt, contact AFAA statisticians for assistance.
            4.5.3.3.3.2. When using non-statistical sampling, just show test results without
            stating or implying an estimate or projection (e.g., ―we identified 50 of 100 work
            orders with labor charges exceeding established limits‖).
     4.5.3.4. Management Corrective Actions. When appropriate, include in the report
     significant discrepancies disclosed and corrected during the audit along with an
     explanation of the corrective action taken. Use the caption ―Management Corrective
     Action‖ for these paragraphs, and be sure to verify that management did, in fact, correct
     the discrepancy. The auditor must document the verification work accomplished in the
     working paper files. In addition to the report, the auditor will report management
     corrective actions completed during the audit in the SAR (Part I, paragraph K, ―Number
     of Corrective Actions Completed During Audit‖). A completed corrective action is
     defined as a completed action (not promised or initiated) that corrects the cited condition
     and eliminates the need for a recommendation.
        4.5.3.4.1. The following is an example of typical actions that should be reported as
        corrective actions completed during the audit: ―During the audit, management
        cancelled the unneeded due outs, trained personnel to properly perform due-out
        validations, and added validation criteria to their self-inspection checklist.‖ In this
        example, management completed three actions which corrected the cited condition
        and addressed the cause cited in the audit results.
        4.5.3.4.2. The following example is an action that should not be reported as a
        corrective action completed during the audit: ―During the audit, management
        initiated action to obtain funding to use in correcting the vulnerabilities cited above.‖
        In this example, the action taken did not ensure the funding would be obtained nor the
        vulnerabilities corrected.
     4.5.3.5. Audit Comments. Include other comments as needed under the caption ―Audit
     Comments.‖ For example, if you discover procedural discrepancies during the conduct
     of a CDA, include a statement that you referred the discrepancies to the audit control
     point for possible inclusion in the Air Force audit report.
     4.5.3.6. Recommendations. Should immediately follow the specific audit result to which
     they relate, in the following order: (a) recommendations to correct the condition, if
     applicable; (b) recommendations addressing the root cause and other contributing causes;
36                                                   AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


     and (c) recommendations to achieve claimed PMB. Do not include a recommendation
     that does not address either a cause or condition statement.
        4.5.3.6.1. Recommendation Requirements. Number recommendations consecutively
        within each tab. For example, if Tab A contains two recommendations, number them
        A.1. and A.2. If Tab B contains three recommendations, number them B.1., B.2., and
        B.3. Each recommendation should:
           4.5.3.6.1.1. Require only one management action per recommendation, even
           though you may direct several related recommendations to the same management
           official. If you require more than one independent management action,
           restructure into separate, numbered recommendations.
           4.5.3.6.1.2. Normally direct recommendations one position higher than the
           staff/official position (not an individual’s name) responsible for taking the
           corrective action. Do not direct recommendations higher than the report
           addressee.
        4.5.3.6.2. Recommendation Logic. The relationship between the recommendations
        and the condition or the cause of the condition must be clear and logical. Each
        recommendation should relate to either a cause or a condition, and conversely each
        cause should have a recommendation.
           4.5.3.6.2.1. Recommend actions that are definite, and avoid to the extent possible
           such words as ensure, consider, perform a study, emphasize, and reevaluate.
           4.5.3.6.2.2. Make two recommendations if the management corrective action may
           take an unusual length of time to complete (e.g., revising a directive). The first
           recommendation should provide a permanent fix for the root cause of the deficient
           condition. The second recommendation should address interim procedures to
           temporarily control the deficient condition until management implements the
           permanent fix.
        4.5.3.6.3. Special Situations. When audit reports identify possible over-obligations
        or project splitting, contracting improprieties, or monies owed to the Government,
        recommend actions necessary to provide a permanent fix to the root cause of the
        exception and actions necessary to recoup any lost funds or assets.
           4.5.3.6.3.1. Over-obligations. Audit reports involving the over-obligation of
           current year funds or project splitting (which would have resulted in violation of
           statute if handled as one project) require a two-part recommendation. In Part 1,
           recommend the unit comptroller or another independent party determine whether
           a violation of DoD 7000.14-R, Department of Defense Financial Management
           Regulations (FMRs), Volume 14, Administrative Control of Funds and
           Antideficiency Act Violations, occurred. In Part 2, recommend that, if a violation
           did occur, management formally investigate and report the violation in
           accordance with DoD 7000.14-R.
           4.5.3.6.3.2. Contracting Improprieties. When audit reports identify possible
           contractor fraud, include recommendations such as: ―The Unit/LG should
           determine whether the contractor should be debarred or suspended,‖ or ―The
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                  37


              Unit/LG, in consultation with the unit Judge Advocate General, should determine
              whether legal action against the contractor is appropriate.‖ In each case, the
              wording of specific recommendations will depend on the auditor’s judgment.
              Although auditors must recognize that the contracting officer has final
              responsibility in dealings with contractors, auditors must consider others,
              including legal authorities.
              4.5.3.6.3.3. Monies Owed to the Government. When audit reports identify
              monies owed to the government, include a recommendation to establish an
              account receivable in accordance with AFI 65-403, Follow-up on Internal
              Air Force Audit Reports, and a recommendation to recoup the amount due. The
              auditor will normally determine the amount management should recoup.
       4.5.3.7. Management Comments. Government auditing standards require reporting the
       views of responsible management officials. Consequently, AFAA requires management
       comments for each negative audit result (exception), recommendation, and PMB included
       in the audit report. If management comments are extremely long, you may paraphrase
       the comments and include them in their entirety as a report attachment.
           4.5.3.7.1. Include management comments verbatim in the final report immediately
           following the recommendation to which the comments relate (paragraph 5.3.5). In
           the draft report, provide a paragraph caption and reserve space for the management
           comments immediately following the associated recommendation.
           4.5.3.7.2. Inclusion of management comments in clear tabs is optional. A clear tab is
           a tab that does not identify any deficient conditions. A tab that identifies deficient
           conditions but does not contain recommendations (e.g., management corrected the
           identified problems during the audit) must include a Management Comments
           paragraph.
       4.5.3.8. Evaluation of Management Comments. The final report will include an
       evaluation addressing the responsiveness of management comments at the end of each
       audit result after the Management Comments paragraph (paragraph 5.4).
           4.5.3.8.1. In the draft report, provide a paragraph caption and reserve space for the
           audit evaluation statement.
           4.5.3.8.2. Do not include an Evaluation of Managements Comments paragraph in
           clear tabs.
4.6. Report FormatAppendices. Include the following appendices with each report:
Background Information (optional), Glossary of Acronyms (optional), Audit Scope and Prior
Audit Coverage, and Points of Contact and Final Report Distribution. Note: The following
appendices may also be required on an individual basis: Interim Report, Management
Comments (final report), Additional Management Documents (final report). Reference AFAAI
65-103, Chapter 14, for additional information on the report appendices.
4.7. Summary of Audit Results Statement. The SAR is an attachment to the report transmittal
memorandum. It contains the details of the audit outcome as well as the auditor’s estimate of the
PMB management will realize by effectively implementing the report’s recommendations.
 38                                                     AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


   4.7.1. SAR Requirement. Auditors prepare a SAR Statement, Part I, for each installation-
   level audit report. In addition, auditors prepare Part II if the report has an audit result
   (exception) with a PMB of $50,000 or more. Ensure the amounts identified in the audit
   report agree with the amounts reported in Parts I and II of the SAR. Make every effort to
   keep classified data out of the SAR. (Note: If unable to process the SAR without classified
   data, the SAR must be handled IAW AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 5.) The SAR template is
   located within the TeamMate library and AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 17, contains guidance for
   preparing the SAR.
   4.7.2. SAR Coordination. Forward draft reports containing PMB and the related SAR to
   your region and then HQ AFAA/DOO for review and coordination prior to discussing the
   report with management. Retain evidence of coordination (generally an e-mail) in the project
   working paper files.
      4.7.2.1. HQ AFAA/DOO provides feedback on these evaluations and, when applicable,
      coordinates recommendations for revised SAR statements and revised reports with the
      applicable region.
      4.7.2.2. Auditors will revise the SAR when the PMB changes due to HQ AFAA/DOO
      review.
4.8. Report Quality Assurance.
   4.8.1. Cross Referencing. The auditor will hyperlink (cross reference) the office chief-
   approved draft report (paragraph 4.8.1.2) and SAR to the working papers. Hyperlink to the
   specific point in the working papers where the support is located. When preparing working
   papers manually, cross reference the draft report to the manual working papers.
      4.8.1.1. The auditor will hyperlink the report and the SAR to exceptions in accordance
      with AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6. The auditor should already have cross referenced from
      the exceptions to the procedures (detail). Note: The auditor may elect to cross reference
      directly to the detailed procedures. While not preferred, this procedure is allowed so long
      as the auditor has prepared exceptions and hyperlinked them accordingly. In some
      instances, the auditor will have to cross reference to a procedure because the information
      is only in a procedure (e.g., background and scope information).
      4.8.1.2. It is only necessary for the auditor to cross reference the draft report once.
      Normally, the auditor will cross reference the approved draft (the draft approved by the
      office chief to discuss with management). The auditor must also cross reference any
      subsequent changes made to the draft report after it has been independently referenced.
      4.8.1.3. Except as noted in paragraph 4.8.1.4, the auditor will hyperlink all reported
      figures, dates, direct quotations, statements of fact, and assertions contained in the
      executive summary, tabs, and appendices. Examples of items auditors sometimes
      overlook but which need hyperlinking include: positive statements in the executive
      summary and tabs; statements in clear reports that management agreed with the results;
      background information, including criteria; causes for audit results; management
      corrective actions; and information in the Audit Scope and Prior Audit Coverage
      appendix (work performed information, data reliability statement, prior audit coverage
      statement, etc.).
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                 39


     4.8.1.4. It is not necessary to hyperlink (cross-reference) repeated information more than
     once. For example, it is not necessary to hyperlink information contained in the
     executive summary that is repeated in the body of the report if the same information in
     the body of the report is hyperlinked to the supporting working paper. Similarly, it is not
     necessary to hyperlink information in a tab synopsis if the same information in the body
     of the tab is hyperlinked to the supporting working paper. Further, if an audit result in a
     report is fully supported by an exception, one hyperlink from the audit report to the
     corresponding exception is sufficient. However, the exception must be appropriately
     linked to the supporting working papers.
  4.8.2. Independent Referencing. Referencing is an independent review of the draft report
  and working paper files by a person not associated with the audit to verify that the report is
  accurate and documentary evidence supports specific statements of fact.
     4.8.2.1. When to Reference. Independently reference the office chief-approved draft
     report, or closure memo, before releasing the report for comment (standard report
     processing, paragraph 4.9.1) or soliciting management comments (accelerated report
     processing, paragraph 4.9.2). The office chief may require earlier referencing; however,
     that will require the implementation of strong controls to ensure subsequent changes to
     the report are re-referenced before the report is released or discussed with management
     (paragraph 4.8.2.10).
     4.8.2.2. Selecting the Referencer. The independent referencer must be a qualified
     auditor competent to do the particular referencing assignment. This competence depends
     on the individual’s independence, objectivity, experience, and knowledge of AFAA
     referencing and reporting requirements. Whenever possible at locations with more than
     one team, the referencer should be someone from another team. Note: Student Career
     Experience Program (SCEP) personnel do not have the experience and knowledge to
     accomplish independent referencing. Similarly, do not assign auditor trainees who have
     not attended the Professional Auditor Training School - Entry Level course to
     independently reference draft audit reports.
     4.8.2.3. Referencer Authority. The auditor and team chief will provide all possible
     assistance in locating material and should be accessible for explanations (any oral
     explanations provided should be added to the working papers). However, working papers
     should normally ―stand on their own.‖ That is, referencers should not have to continually
     ask the auditor for assistance in finding evidence to support facts and figures in the
     report.
     4.8.2.4. Independent Referencer Checklist. Referencers are encouraged, but not
     required, to use the Independent Referencer Checklist as an aid in completing the
     referencing assignment. If used, hyperlink the completed Independent Referencer
     Checklist to the Independent Referencer Review Package Report.
     4.8.2.5. Referencer Responsibilities. The independent referencer will:
         4.8.2.5.1. Before starting any work related to referencing the assigned project,
         document their independence from the project in their first TeamMate coaching note
         as follows: ―I certify that I am independent on this project and have not worked on it
         prior to being assigned as independent referencer.‖
40                                                     AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


        4.8.2.5.2. Trace all figures, dates, direct quotations, statements of fact, and auditor
        assertions in the hyperlinked (cross-referenced) draft report and SAR through the
        exception to the procedures to determine that they are consistent with and supported
        by the working papers. Note: If the referencer encounters information that the
        auditor did not hyperlink, except repeated information (paragraph 4.8.1.4), then the
        referencer will return the report and working papers to the auditor so he or she can
        finish hyperlinking. The referencer will not omit items from the verification process
        because the auditor did not completely hyperlink the report.
        4.8.2.5.3. Place an independent referencer mark next to each figure and statement of
        fact verified in the report and next to the supporting evidence in the detail working
        papers.
        4.8.2.5.4. Verify the mathematical accuracy of tables, charts, figures, and schedules
        included in the report.
        4.8.2.5.5. Be alert to statements in the report which seem illogical or lack clarity. If
        the referencer does not understand what the auditor is trying to say, there is a good
        chance management will not understand either.
        4.8.2.5.6. Ensure the team chief has reviewed all supporting working papers and
        cleared the auditor’s TeamMate coaching notes. The independent referencer will not
        complete the Referencing Certification (paragraph 4.8.2.9) until the team chief has
        finished reviewing and signed off on all the working papers.
        4.8.2.5.7. Create coaching notes in TeamMate (paragraph 4.8.2.9) along with the
        Independent Referencer Checklist (paragraph 4.8.2.4) to document all comments,
        questions, and opinions pertaining to the review. Note: If the referencer used the
        Independent Referencer Checklist, hyperlink the independent referencer’s coaching
        notes to the checklist.
        4.8.2.5.8. Once the independent referencing is complete and the auditor has resolved
        all issues or discrepancies, the independent referencer will attest to the satisfactory
        completion of all suggestions and/or comments noted during the review in accordance
        with the Independent Referencer Certification Package template. This should be the
        independent referencer’s last coaching note.
        4.8.2.5.9. Charge all time referencing the subject project to the project within AFAA
        MIS.
     4.8.2.6. Auditor Responsibilities. The auditor will:
        4.8.2.6.1. Prepare and maintain working papers in accordance with paragraphs 3.3
        through 3.5 and AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 6.
        4.8.2.6.2. Cross-reference the office chief-approved draft report (paragraph 4.8.1).
        4.8.2.6.3. Respond to each referencing note, indicating agreement or disagreement,
        and specify the actions that have been or will be taken to correct the discrepancy. For
        example, the auditor may add additional support (to the working papers or cross-
        referencing) or change the draft report.
        4.8.2.6.4. Elevate points on which there is disagreement to the team chief for review.
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                     41


        4.8.2.6.5. Notify the team chief when making significant changes to the report or the
        SAR after completing independent referencing, and cross-reference changes to the
        working papers.
        4.8.2.6.6. Retain the independently referenced draft report, Independent Referencer
        Review Package Report, and Independent Referencer Checklist (if used) in the
        Independent Reference folder.
     4.8.2.7. Team Chief Responsibilities. The team chief will:
        4.8.2.7.1. Review all project working papers and the draft report for technical
        accuracy and consistency prior to initiating the referencing process.
        4.8.2.7.2. Select the referencer for each project and assure the referencer understands
        his or her responsibilities as discussed in this chapter. If the person assigned is a first-
        time referencer, review with that person the requirements of this instruction.
        4.8.2.7.3. Review the independent referencer’s comments, verify changes in the
        report resulting from the referencing review, and resolve any disagreements between
        the auditor and independent referencer. The team chief will document the rationale
        underlying resolved disagreements within the independent referencer’s TeamMate
        coaching notes and elevate unresolved issues to the office chief for resolution.
        4.8.2.7.4. Respond to the final independent referencer coaching note (which should
        be attesting to the satisfactory completion of all suggestions and/or comments noted
        during the review) in accordance with the Independent Referencer Certification
        Package template.
        4.8.2.7.5. Assure all subsequent significant changes to the report and the SAR are
        independently referenced in accordance with paragraph 4.8.2.10
     4.8.2.8. Office Chief Responsibilities. The office chief will, during working paper
     reviews (paragraph 1.3.1.8), confirm that independent referencing requirements were
     accomplished in accordance with Agency policy.
     4.8.2.9. Independent Referencer Review Package. The independent referencer will
     document all comments, questions, and discrepancies using TeamMate coaching notes,
     which will subsequently be included in the TeamMate-generated Independent Referencer
     Review Package Report. The auditor will clearly accept, modify, or reject each coaching
     note. The auditor will also identify any resulting changes made to the draft report. For
     any rejected points, the auditor will include a brief explanation and elevate to the team
     chief for a decision. The team chief will resolve all disagreements and document the
     rationale for his or her decisions within the independent referencer’s TeamMate coaching
     notes.
     4.8.2.10. Re-referencing. If the audit team makes significant changes to the report or the
     SAR after completing independent referencing, the team chief must select an independent
     person to re-reference the changed or added material. Significant changes include
     changes in scope (e.g., audit universe or sample size), changes in condition (e.g.,
     differences in number, location, or amounts of deficiencies), new or changed examples,
     and any statements added to report management corrective actions. The team chief will
     determine when to re-reference and what changes in the report need re-referencing.

   4.8.3. CDA-Related Reports. After independent referencing is completed, the team chief
   will e-mail the audit manager a document certifying an independent referencer verified the
   adequacy and accuracy of data in the referenced draft report. The auditor will retain an
   electronic copy of the e-mail in the working paper files. The team chief may use a
   certification memo, the Independent Referencer Certification Package, or a verification
   email. Applicable TeamMate templates and reports are provided on the AFAA Home CoP
   for convenience.
   4.8.4. Report Review Checklist. As an additional quality control, team chiefs are
   encouraged (though not required) to use the Report Review Checklist located on the AFAA
   Home CoP.
4.9. Draft Report Processing. After office chief approval, two methods exist to process the
draft report: standard processing and accelerated processing. Note: For classified reports,
reference paragraph 4.12
   4.9.1. Standard Report Processing.
      4.9.1.1. Discussions. After the office chief approves the draft report for discussion and it
      is independently referenced, the audit team will discuss (out-brief) the report with
      operating personnel, supervisors in the chain of command, and the responsible
      commander or designated representative. Except for changes resulting from the
      discussions, the audit team should not further change the audit report without advising
      officials in charge of the audited activity and the commander. Note: If a CDA, the audit
      manager must also approve the draft report before out-briefing management.
          4.9.1.1.1. The audit team, in coordination with management, will determine the
          appropriate officials with whom to discuss the report. Discussions should, at a
          minimum, reach the group commander or equivalent level.
          4.9.1.1.2. Before distributing reports electronically, ensure the reports are clean
          copies free of track change markings and report-processing comments.
      4.9.1.2. Discussion Records. Document the out-briefing discussions using the AFAA
      Discussion Memo, or similar document. Retain the discussion records in the working
      paper files. Document the following:
          4.9.1.2.1. Discussion dates and names and positions of attending personnel.
          4.9.1.2.2. Discussion details.
          4.9.1.2.3. For CDAs, summarize what was discussed with management officials
          regarding data provided to the audit manager.
      4.9.1.3. Draft Report Transmittal Memorandum. After discussing the report with
      management, (a) the auditor makes any agreed-to changes, (b) the office chief approves
      the changes, and (c) the team chief signs the transmittal memorandum and distributes the
      completed audit report to management for comment. A Draft Report Transmittal
      Memorandum template for standard processing is included in the TeamMate library.
      Note: The title on the transmittal memorandum will agree with the audit announcement
      memorandum.
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                  43


         4.9.1.3.1. Allow management officials 30 calendar days to provide their comments.
         Note: The 30 days is a guide; AAOs should work closely with management to obtain
         comments sooner if possible.
         4.9.1.3.2. Do not assign a report number to the draft report. Rather, assign the
         number to the final report just before publication.
         4.9.1.3.3. In addition to the report, attach the following to the transmittal
         memorandum: (a) a copy of AFI 65-301, Audit Reporting Procedures, paragraph
         1.5.1. and Attachment 2; and (b) SAR Statement, Parts I and II (if applicable).
     4.9.1.4. Draft Report Distribution. Transmit the draft report to the unit audit focal point.
     The audit focal point will task out the report for management comments to officials in
     charge of the audited activity (and to all other applicable levels of supervision).
         4.9.1.4.1. Before transmitting the report electronically, ensure it is free of track
         change markings and report-processing comments.
         4.9.1.4.2. Refer to Attachments 2 thru 4 for standard and special distribution
         requirements. Some organizations (e.g., AFRC) have specific special distribution
         requirements in addition to normal distribution requirements.
  4.9.2. Accelerated Report Processing. Audit offices may use accelerated report-processing
  procedures to reduce the waiting period for obtaining management comments. The actual
  procedures used to accelerate report processing vary from office to office. The following
  provides general guidelines.
     4.9.2.1. Report Discussions. After the office chief approves the draft report for
     discussion and the independent referencer completes work, the audit team out-briefs the
     report with management. Discussions start with unit operating personnel and work up to
     more senior management levels (e.g., squadron and group commanders). The auditor
     obtains oral comments to exceptions, recommendations, and PMB during the report out-
     brief discussions. Based on the oral agreements, the auditor updates the draft report and
     inserts proposed management comments on the exceptions, recommendations, and PMB.
     4.9.2.2. Discussion Record. During the discussions, obtain signatures from the
     participants and the applicable supervisors stating that they agree with the management
     comments included in the out-briefed draft report. At the squadron commander level and
     above, some offices use an AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, to document
     commander coordination. Include the out-briefed draft and the management coordination
     documents (including staff summary sheet, if applicable) in the working paper file.
     4.9.2.3. Report Changes. The audit team may revise the draft report as a result of the
     discussions, to add or change information or to show additional corrective action taken
     during audit fieldwork. In these instances, the audit team must obtain evidence verifying
     the new or changed information or the corrective actions taken and document the results
     in the working paper files. The new or revised information will require independent
     referencing. If the audit team makes significant report changes after out-briefing lower
     level operating personnel, the audit team will (a) obtain office chief approval for the
     changes and (b) notify the lower level operating personnel of the changes.
 44                                                      AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


       4.9.2.4. Commander Approval. Out-brief the commander (wing, center, or tenant unit)
       or the commander’s designated representative using the draft with management
       comments inserted. Obtain commander approval of the management comments at the
       out-briefing (on the staff summary sheet, if applicable, or other written record).
           4.9.2.4.1. If commander approval is not obtained at the out-briefing, prepare a
           memorandum transmitting the audit report to the unit audit focal point. The audit
           focal point will obtain commander approval of the management comments. An
           Accelerated Reporting Memorandum template for this purpose is included in the
           TeamMate library. Attach the staff summary sheet, if applicable, or other written
           record showing the prior coordination.
           4.9.2.4.2. Allow 5 days for management to coordinate and approve the proposed
           comments. Note: The 5 days is a guide. AAOs should work closely with
           management to obtain comments sooner if possible.
   4.9.3. Issuing Reports to Non-Air Force Activities. AFAA audit reports will not contain
   exceptions and recommendations directed to non-Air Force activities without the approval of
   the ODIG-AUD. If an AFAA office conducting a locally initiated audit proposes to issue a
   report with recommendations to a non-Air Force activity, the team chief must contact
   HQ AFAA/DOO through the chain of command. HQ AFAA/DOO will coordinate with the
   ODIG-AUD to take the necessary and appropriate steps (paragraph 1.9).
4.10. Local Reporting of CDA Results. Prepare an installation-level audit report at the
conclusion of all CDA application efforts, except for fact-gathering projects. The local report
must be technically accurate and must not contradict conclusions reported in the Air Force-level
audit report. Note: Close out fact-gathering projects in accordance with paragraphs 4.3.1.3 and
4.10.4 Do not issue a report for fact-gathering projects without first obtaining HQ AFAA/DOO
authorization.
   4.10.1. Audit Manager Coordination. Forward a copy of the draft report to the audit
   manager for review and approval before discussing the report with local management
   officials. The audit manager will recommend technical changes to the report, or notify the
   auditor (in writing with a copy to the team chief) that the report is technically accurate. The
   auditor will retain a copy of the audit manager’s coordination in the working paper file.
   4.10.2. Disagreement Resolution. If the auditor disagrees with the audit manager’s proposed
   technical changes, the team chief will contact the audit manager and attempt to resolve the
   disagreements. Elevate any remaining unresolved disagreements to the office chief and
   program manager for resolution. If the office chief and program manager cannot agree upon
   the technical content of the report, the responsible associate director and region chief will
   resolve the issue. The auditor and team chief will ensure that the related working paper file
   explains the rationale for subsequently including or excluding issues in the installation level
   report based on directions from the audit manager. Do not begin report discussions until all
   disagreements have been resolved.
   4.10.3. Report Discussions. During report discussions related to a CDA effort, inform
   applicable management personnel and the commander, either orally or in writing, of the
   pertinent data submitted to the audit manager. Document all discussions and retain the
   discussion record in the working paper file.
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                    45


      4.10.3.1. Inform unit officials that the audit manager may include data submitted, as well
      as any installation-level audit results (exceptions), in an Air Force-level audit report. The
      auditor will provide a copy of the Air Force report (draft and final copies) to the audit
      focal point upon release of the report.
      4.10.3.2. The judgment of the team chief will prevail as to the extent of disclosure. Keep
      in mind the purposes of the notification: to provide full disclosure and to ensure the
      commander is not surprised when the audit manager issues the Air Force audit report.
   4.10.4. Audit Assist Discussions. Notify management of the data provided to the audit
   manager in response to a special request for data or other fact-finding work accomplished to
   assist the audit manager.
   4.10.5. Reporting Level. In determining whether audit results should be reported in the
   installation-level report or the CDA report, consider the following:
      4.10.5.1. Conditions Correctable Locally. Include in installation-level audit reports the
      exceptions correctable by local management. Forward to the audit manager for
      evaluation and appropriate action conditions which management cannot correct locally.
      4.10.5.2. MAJCOM Issues. Address audit results requiring MAJCOM corrective action
      in the Air Force audit report. Issue installation-level audit reports and/or Additional
      Results Memorandums to the MAJCOM element only for conditions the audit manager
      concludes are not significant enough to address in the Air Force audit report.
      4.10.5.3. Program and System Audits. In those instances where the Air Force has vested
      a substantial part of overall management in one focal point, include the audit results in an
      Air Force audit report. For example, include audit exceptions related to a system
      program office-managed weapon system, a commodity managed by a single air logistics
      center item manager, or a Standard Systems Group-managed program in an Air Force
      audit report. Issue installation-level audit reports to program or system offices only for
      conditions not significant enough to address in the Air Force audit report.
4.11. Follow-up Audit Reports.
   4.11.1. Report Attributes. If the follow-up audit discloses the following conditions, take the
   action indicated.
      4.11.1.1. Repeat Exceptions. Identify exceptions as ―repeat‖ if the current conditions are
      substantially the same as that disclosed by the prior audit. Identify exceptions as ―repeat‖
      whether or not the cause of the current conditions and the recommendations to correct the
      current conditions are the same as those in the prior report.
          4.11.1.1.1. If management either implemented the recommendation or took other
          corrective actions, give management credit in the follow-up audit report for taking
          action, and identify the reasons management’s actions did not correct the deficiency.
          Since the exception still exists, the original report likely did not identify the root
          cause.
          4.11.1.1.2. If management did not act on the recommendation or took action other
          than indicated in their written response, provide details in the report explaining why
          management did not act or why management’s alternative action did not correct the
          problem.
46                                                      AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


     4.11.1.2. New Exceptions. Auditors conduct follow-up audits to determine whether
     management corrected the deficiencies cited in earlier reports. Normally, auditors will
     not develop new exceptions in follow-up audits. However, it may occasionally happen
     that the auditor will identify new, reportable conditions during a follow-up audit. When
     that happens, the auditor should prepare one (follow-up) report and clearly differentiate
     between the repeat and new exceptions. Put the repeat exceptions in one tab (the first
     tab) and the new exceptions in a separate tab. Note: If the follow-up audit did not
     identify any repeat exceptions, the auditor should put the clear follow-up results in the
     executive summary and the new exceptions in a tab.
     4.11.1.3. No Exceptions. If management implemented the recommendations or took
     other responsive actions that corrected the deficiencies, and you identified no additional
     exceptions related to the follow-up issues, issue management a clear follow-up audit
     report.
  4.11.2. Follow-up Report Format. Except as noted in the following paragraphs, use the same
  format for a follow-up report as for a regular report.
     4.11.2.1. Report Title. Begin the report title with ―Follow-up Audit, . . .‖
     4.11.2.2. Executive Summary.
         4.11.2.2.1. Introduction. The first paragraph must identify what initiated the follow-
         up audit and reference the prior report (cite report number, title, and date). For
         example, ―This locally initiated follow-up audit evaluated management actions taken
         in response to Audit Report XXXXXXXX, (title), (date).‖
         4.11.2.2.2. Objectives. Identify the recommendations in the original audit report
         selected for follow-up. For example, ―The overall objective was to determine
         whether management actions implemented in response to Recommendations 1, 2, and
         5 in Audit Report XXXXXXXX were effective and corrected the conditions
         previously reported. In addition, we verified the actual amount of monetary benefits
         realized as a result of the previous audit.‖
         4.11.2.2.3. Conclusions. For the recommendations followed up on, the conclusions
         paragraph must summarize all deficiencies corrected by management. Also, auditors
         must clearly identify any repeat deficiencies as ―repeat exceptions‖ and reference the
         appropriate audit results (exception) paragraphs of the prior audit report. Identify any
         benefits (monetary or non-monetary) lost because management did not act or took
         action that was not adequate to correct the problem.
     4.11.2.3. Audit Scope and Prior Audit Coverage. In the Prior Audit Coverage section,
     include a statement similar to the following: ―Other than the report which was the
     subject of this follow-up audit, our review of audit files and contact with base officials
     disclosed no other audit report issued to the _____Wing by any audit agency within the
     last 5 years that related to our audit objectives.‖
  4.11.3. PMB in Follow-up Reports. Do not report PMB that is related to a repeat exception.
  Auditors can claim and report PMB only one time for each exception because follow-up
  officials credit the prior report and recommendation with all PMB achieved. The only time
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                              47


   an auditor can report a PMB on the SAR of a follow-up audit report is when the PMB is part
   of a new exception and recommendation not previously reported.
4.12. Classified Reports. When an audit report contains classified material (Confidential,
Secret, or Top Secret), annotate the proper classification of the subject element and each
paragraph of the audit report before you release the draft for discussion and management
comments. Detailed guidance for processing classified reports can be found at AFAAI 65-103,
Chapter 5; AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management, Chapter 6; and DoDI
5200.01, DoD Information Security Program and Protection of Sensitive Compartmented
Information, Chapter 4. The auditor should make every effort to keep the report unclassified.
 48                                                         AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


                                             Chapter 5

                      FINAL REPORT AND POST-AUDIT ACTIONS

5.1. Overview. AFAA final audit reports will include the views of responsible management
officials as a means of verifying the report’s fairness, completeness, and objectivity. Audit
teams will use the guidance in this chapter to receive and evaluate management comments, insert
management comments and their evaluation of management comments, and process the final
report. This chapter contains additional guidance auditors will use to issue final reports when
management does not provide comments, track implementation actions on recommendations
selected for follow up, and process the customer survey.
5.2. Responsibilities.
   5.2.1. The office chief will:
       5.2.1.1. Approve the evaluation of management comments.
       5.2.1.2. Dual-sign (with the team chief) and distribute the final report. Note: Prior to
       signing the final report, the office program assistant should review the report for
       conformance with format and administrative requirements. An Administrative Checklist
       is located on the AFAA Home CoP. Use of the checklist is encouraged but not required.
       5.2.1.3. Establish a control system to assure significant changes between the referenced
       draft report and the final report are re-referenced.
       5.2.1.4. Maintain a log of recommendations team chiefs select for follow up.
       Attachment 5, Audit Follow-Up Log, contains a suggested format.
       5.2.1.5. Compute the average customer response for each of the audit process
       effectiveness survey’s five questions and provide the results to the region.
       5.2.1.6. Ensure final reports are distributed in accordance with Attachments 2 through 4.
   5.2.2. The team chief will:
       5.2.2.1. Work with management to the extent possible to ensure timely receipt of
       responsive management comments.
       5.2.2.2. In coordination with the auditor, review and evaluate management comments to
       assure they adequately address exceptions, recommendations, and PMB in the report and
       meet the requirements of this instruction and AFI 65-301, Chapter 1.
       5.2.2.3. Dual sign (with the office chief) all final reports.
       5.2.2.4. Appoint an independent referencer to re-verify any significant changes between
       the final report and the referenced draft report.
       5.2.2.5. Identify significant report recommendations to the office chief for follow-up
       audit planning.
       5.2.2.6. In coordination with the auditor, select appropriate personnel in units audited to
       receive the audit process effectiveness survey.
   5.2.3. The auditor will:
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                  49


       5.2.3.1. Contact the management action officer or audit focal point 7 days before the due
       date to determine if any problems exist with the draft report or with meeting the suspense
       date. The auditor should also attempt to obtain advance management comments from the
       management action officer and provide feedback regarding the responsiveness of those
       comments. Note: In some offices, the team chief may choose to accomplish this action.
       5.2.3.2. In coordination with the team chief, review and evaluate management comments
       to assure they adequately address reported exceptions, recommendations, and PMB and
       meet the requirements of this instruction and AFI 65-301, Chapter 1 and Attachment 2.
       5.2.3.3. Advise the team chief of any significant report changes (differences between the
       final report and the independently referenced draft report) that need re-referencing.
       5.2.3.4. Finalize and back up the working papers in accordance with paragraph 3.3.4
5.3. Management Comments–General Guidance. To assure reports are fair, complete, and
objective, government auditing standards require auditors to include the views of responsible
management officials in the final report.
   5.3.1. AFAA Requirement. Management comments are required for each audit result
   (exception), recommendation, and PMB included in the audit report, except as discussed in
   paragraph 5.3.1.1 Management must provide formal written comments signed by the
   commander (wing, installation, center, or tenant unit commander) or the commander’s
   designated representative unless the audit team is using accelerated report-processing
   procedures or the report contains no recommendations. When using accelerated report-
   processing procedures, the commander or the commander’s designated representative must
   provide evidence that he or she reviewed and approved the management comments in the
   report (paragraph 4.9.2.4).
       5.3.1.1. Formal, written management comments are not required for clear reports
       (reports without discrepant conditions) and for reports with discrepant conditions if
       management corrected the discrepancies during the audit (i.e., no recommendation
       required) and the report contains PMB of less than $50,000.
       5.3.1.2. If an exception corrected during the audit (i.e., no recommendation required)
       contains a claimed PMB of $50,000 or more, then obtain written management comments
       for the PMB. Do not regard silence as agreement. If management agrees with the PMB,
       include a statement in the final report that management agreed with the PMB. If
       management nonconcurs with the PMB, follow the guidance in AFAAI 65-103, Chapter
       17.
       5.3.1.3. For clear reports and reports with no recommendations, auditors will obtain from
       management an oral or e-mail concurrence with the audit results, and include a statement
       in the final report (reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 15) that management officials
       agreed with the audit results and concurred with the issues as presented in the report. If
       management orally concurs with the report, document the discussion and include a copy
       in the working paper file. If management provides an e-mail response, include a copy of
       the e-mail in the working papers.
   5.3.2. Time Allowance for Management Comments. AFI 65-301 allows managers 30 days
   to provide formal comments to installation-level audit reports (15 days for interim reports).
50                                                       AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


  While these are standard times, AAOs are encouraged to work with management to obtain
  comments earlier. For example, auditors may obtain oral comments to recommendations
  using the accelerated report-processing procedures discussed in paragraph 4.9.2 However, if
  management nonconcurs, the 30-day rule applies.
  5.3.3. Late Management Comments. If management does not provide comments to the draft
  report within 30 calendar days, meet with unit officials to (a) determine the specific cause for
  the delay and (b) ask them for a specific date by which they will submit the comments.
     5.3.3.1. If the cause of the delay seems justified, grant management the additional time,
     up to 30 calendar days. Document the rationale for granting any extensions in the
     working paper file.
     5.3.3.2. If the cause of the delay does not seem justified, or management indicates it
     needs an extension exceeding 30 calendar days, coordinate with the region chief and
     decide whether to wait for the management comments or publish the final report without
     management comments. Follow the guidance in paragraph 5.6 when issuing a report
     without management comments.
  5.3.4. Receiving Management Comments. When management comments are received, the
  auditor and team chief will ensure the comments meet the requirements specified in
  AFI 65301, Chapter 1 and Attachment 2.
     5.3.4.1. Specifically, the auditor and team chief will ensure the management comments
     indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with each audit result (exception),
     recommendation, and PMB. The comments must also describe corrective actions (both
     taken and planned), give actual or planned completion dates, and provide the rationale for
     any disagreements.
     5.3.4.2. Return comments not meeting the requirements of AFI 65-301 to management
     for correction.
  5.3.5. Inserting Management Comments in the Report. Insert management comments in the
  Management Comments paragraph following each recommendation (paragraph 4.5.3.7).
  Correct grammatical, punctuation, or spelling errors in the management comments using
  caution to prevent making any changes in meaning or intent.
     5.3.5.1. Incorporate management comments verbatim, as corrected, and begin each
     management comment paragraph by stating whether management concurred or
     nonconcurred with the recommendation (e.g., Unit/CC concurred and stated ―. . . .‖ or
     Unit/CC stated: ―Concur. . . .‖).
     5.3.5.2. If management comments are excessively long, paraphrase or summarize them
     in the body of the report and include them verbatim as an appendix to the report. Note:
     When applicable, place the Management Comments appendix between the Audit Scope
     and Prior Audit Coverage appendix and the Points of Contact and Final Report
     Distribution appendices.
     5.3.5.3. If management personnel attach copies of various documents (policy
     memorandums, studies, etc.) to their management comments, include the documents in
     the report as an appendix if the documents add to the reader’s understanding of the issues
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                     51


       contained in the report. Otherwise, incorporate the documents into the audit report by
       reference only and file the documents in the working papers.
       5.3.5.4. Ensure the audit report does not contain a suspense date for management action
       that will occur before the anticipated date of the final report. In these cases, verify
       management has taken corrective action and annotate the action ―Closed.‖ If
       management has not taken corrective action, ask management to provide a revised
       estimated completion date.
       5.3.5.5. If an estimated completion date does not appear reasonable, contact management
       and determine their rationale for arriving at the planned completion date. Unreasonable
       completion dates are considered nonresponsive. If planned management action will take
       over 12 months to accomplish, ensure management comments provide interim milestones
       with which to track the completion of management action.
       5.3.5.6. If the audit result identifies a deficient condition but does not contain a
       recommendation because management corrected the problem during the audit, place the
       Management Comments paragraph after the Management Corrective Actions paragraph.
       If the audit result identifies a positive condition, a Management Comments paragraph is
       optional. If included, place the Management Comments paragraph after the effect
       statement.
5.4. Evaluating Management Comments. The auditor and team chief will assess whether the
management comments adequately address the issues contained in the report, submit the
evaluation for approval to the office chief, and insert the approved evaluation in the final report.
Reference AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 15 for guidance on evaluating management comments. Also,
if management comments are considered a nonconcurrence, follow the guidance in AFAAI 65-
103, Chapter 15 and AFI 65-301, Chapter 3.
5.5. Final Report Processing.
   5.5.1. Re-referencing. The team chief will appoint an independent auditor to verify any
   significant changes to the final report (differences between the independently referenced
   draft report and the final report).
   5.5.2. Report Date. Date the report as of the day you will send it to the addressee.
   5.5.3. Cutoff Date. Do not issue or date reports of audit in periods HQ AFAA/DOO
   specifies in its guidance for the Semiannual Follow-up Status Report and Inspector General
   Act Report.
   5.5.4. Final Report Distribution. Distribute final reports in accordance with the standard and
   special distribution requirements specified in Attachments 2 through 4.
   5.5.5. HQ AFAA/DOO Distribution. E-mail HQ AFAA/DOO a copy of each published
   report and related SAR in PDF format, and the associated locally developed audit program.
   When sending a locally developed audit program to HQ AFAA/DOO (to include schedules
   and changes made during the audit), remove all signatures and initials due to privacy
   concerns. Additionally, strip all documents of working paper status coding, dates
   independent referencing marks and links, and hyperlinks to include any marks or addresses
   (i.e.@@, file name, etc). Do not convert the audit program to PDF format. Send the e-mail
   to the HQ AFAA/DO library mail box (library@pentagon.af.mil), and include in the upper
 52                                                     AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


   right hand corner of the SAR the DoD category, hours, and cost. For classified reports,
   process and distribute in accordance with DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program, and
   AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. Also, attach a copy of the
   classification review performed by the management OPR.
   5.5.6. SAR Distribution. Distribute the SAR with reports issued to the applicable unit,
   MAJCOM focal point, and AFAA activities. Exclude the SAR from final reports issued to
   other addressees.
   5.5.7. Revised Reports. Issue a revised report if significant errors or other circumstances
   (e.g., new information) materially impacting on report completeness or accuracy surface after
   issuing the final report. Do not issue a revised report to correct grammatical, spelling, or
   other administrative errors or omissions that have no material effect on the meaning, intent,
   or accuracy of the report contents. Contact HQ AFAA/DOO to obtain guidance for revising
   a report.
   5.5.8. SAR Revisions. If the audit team revises the SAR after releasing the final report, the
   team chief should forward the revised SAR to HQ AFAA/DOO. Send the revised SAR to
   the HQ AFAA/DO library mail box (library@pentagon.af.mil) and the base and MAJCOM
   audit focal points. This will normally result from issuing a revised report or a HQ
   AFAA/DOO post review.
   5.5.9. Archiving. Within 2 weeks of the report distribution date, the audit team will archive
   the working papers in accordance with paragraph 3.3.4 and AFAAI 65-103, Chapter 5.
5.6. Reports Without Management Comments. If the audit team issues a final report without
management comments (due to non-receipt), advise the commander of the requirement to elevate
the report as a nonconcurrence within 30 calendar days (the time period prescribed in AFI 65-
301). In the Executive Summary, Management’s Response paragraph, include a statement such
as ―We did not receive management comments before report publication.‖
   5.6.1. If management provides comments within 30 calendar days, issue a revised final
   report incorporating the management comments and the audit evaluation. Note: If the
   management comments are not responsive, process the report in accordance with AFAAI 65-
   103, Chapter 15.
       5.6.1.1. Use the same title and report number as the original report. Date the revised
       report as of the date of re-issuance.
       5.6.1.2. Place ―(REVISED)‖ centered below the report number on the report cover page.
       5.6.1.3. State in the Executive Summary introduction paragraph’s first sentence, ―This
       report rescinds Audit Report XXXXXXXX, (subject), dated (date).‖ The next sentence
       should state: ―This revised report includes management comments and the audit
       evaluation of management comments.‖
       5.6.1.4. In the Audit Scope and Prior Audit Coverage appendix, indicate the date
       management provided comments.
       5.6.1.5. Attach an updated SAR, if applicable, that reflects management’s position.
   5.6.2. If you do not receive management comments within 30 calendar days after issuing the
   final report, elevate the report as a nonconcurrence to the AFAA MAJCOM representative
AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                53


   for resolution action with a copy to HQ AFAA/DOO. If you receive management comments
   after you elevate the report as a nonconcurrence, send the comments to the MAJCOM
   representative for coordination with command officials, and send a copy to HQ AFAA/DOO.
   Do not revise the final report.
5.7. Follow-up Audits.
   5.7.1. Purpose. Perform follow up on audit results and recommendations contained in prior
   audit reports to determine whether (a) management took the recommended actions or
   satisfactory alternatives, (b) the actions management took were effective in eliminating the
   deficiencies, and (c) management realized the PMB.
   5.7.2. Scheduling. At the conclusion of each audit, the team chief will determine whether
   the report contains significant recommendations meeting the follow-up criteria discussed
   below. Notify the office chief of all recommendations selected for follow up. Office chiefs
   will include reports with recommendations selected for follow up in local audit plans.
   Schedule the audits a minimum of 6 months after management completes corrective actions
   and resources are available.
      5.7.2.1. When it is time to follow up on the selected recommendations and management
      has not closed the recommendations, determine the reason for the delay. If the delay
      does not seem reasonable and management actions are more than 6 months overdue,
      proceed with the follow-up audit. If the delay does seem reasonable, allow management
      more time to complete their actions before proceeding with the follow-up audit.
      5.7.2.2. If management has not completed implementation actions on any
      recommendation 6 months after the agreed-to date (whether or not selected for follow
      up), follow up to determine reasons for the delay.
   5.7.3. Criteria. Use the following criteria to select recommendations for follow up.
      5.7.3.1. Mission-Related Items. Follow up on audit results that involved deficiencies
      having significant effect on the performance of an installation’s mission (for example,
      ineffective flying training program or critical logistics shortfalls).
      5.7.3.2. Potential Monetary Benefits. Follow up on all audit results that identified a
      PMB of $500,000 or more. An objective of the follow-up audit will include verifying the
      amount of PMB realized.
      5.7.3.3. Recoupment Actions. Follow up on all recommendations that involved
      management initiating action to recoup $50,000 or more.
      5.7.3.4. Controls and Fraud. Follow up on all reports that identified significant control
      problems or problems safeguarding resources from unauthorized use or disposition.
      5.7.3.5. Potential Antideficiency Act Violations. Follow up to review the accuracy and
      propriety of management actions taken as a result of an audit recommendation to
      determine whether an Anti-deficiency Act violation has occurred (see paragraph
      4.5.3.6.3.1).
      5.7.3.6. Other. Follow up on other audit results and recommendations that, in the
      judgment of the office chief, warrant follow up.
 54                                                      AFAAI65-101 19 NOVEMBER 2010


   5.7.4. Follow-up Log. For audit planning purposes, office chiefs will maintain a log of
   recommendations selected for follow-up. Attachment 5, Audit Follow-up Log, contains a
   suggested format. Review the audit follow-up log periodically to identify ―open‖
   recommendations for which the estimated completion date has passed. Contact (or have the
   team chief contact) the audit focal point to determine the reasons for the slippage and obtain
   a revised estimated completion date. Note: AFI 65-403, Followup on Internal Air Force
   Audit Reports, Chapter 2, requires audit focal points to provide the AAO progress reports
   describing the status of actions taken on report recommendations.
5.8. Audit Process Effectiveness Survey.
   5.8.1. Purpose. At the end of each audit, the AAO will send selected unit officials an audit
   process effectiveness survey (also known as the customer survey). The customer survey
   contains five questions which solicit management’s opinion on the value of the audit,
   professionalism of the audit staff, timeliness of the audit results, and effectiveness of
   communication (oral and written). The team chief, in coordination with the auditor, selects
   the survey recipients and provides their names to the office chief. Recipients are normally
   from among the recommendation addressees or members of their staff. For reports without
   recommendations, the unit commander or a member of the commander’s staff should
   normally be the recipient.
   5.8.2. Survey Distribution. The AAO program assistant prepares, and the office chief signs,
   a standard cover memorandum that transmits the customer survey to the selected officials.
   The cover memorandum contains two attachments: the customer survey and the final report.
   The program assistant normally distributes the cover memorandum, customer survey, and
   final report to the selected recipients when distributing the final report. An Audit
   Effectiveness Survey template, including the cover memorandum and customer survey, is
   included in the TeamMate library.
   5.8.3. Survey Tracking. The AAO program assistant will keep a record of customer surveys
   sent out and retain returned customer surveys in an appropriate office file. In addition, the
   program assistant will send a copy of each returned customer survey to the applicable audit
   team for filing with the project working papers. AAOs will normally not follow up on
   unreturned survey questionnaires.
   5.8.4. Survey Results. The office chief maintains return percentages and reports them to the
   region upon request. At the end of each quarter, the office chief computes the numerical
   average for each of the survey’s five questions and reports the averages to the region. The
   office chief should investigate and document (for local use only) a response for all questions
   receiving a score of ―1‖ and others the office chief deems necessary.
   5.8.5. Region Compilation. Each region should compare and average quarterly AAO survey
   data when received. Investigate any data reflecting adverse trends or occurrences as deemed
   necessary. By the 15th of the month following each quarter, regions should forward numeric
   data to the HQ AFAA/DO Executive Council Advisor for inclusion in the AFAA-wide trend
   analysis.

* ANGI 65-102, Auditing in the Air National Guard, includes detailed procedures for
processing AFAA audit reports. The ANG Audit Focal Point (NGB/FMPP) does not require
copies of draft reports unless a nonconcurrence exists. Except in cases of nonconcurrence,
ANG units respond directly to AAOs. As soon as a potential nonconcurrence is identified
during the audit process, provide a copy of the draft report to NGB/FMFP who will attempt to
resolve the disagreement by working with the ANG office of primary responsibility and the
audit team. If the audit team and NGB/FMFP cannot resolve the nonconcurrence, forward the
final report containing the nonconcurrence to the AFAA ANG Representative
(afaa.northeast@afncr.af.mil) and NGB/FMFP. The AFAA ANG Representative will allow
ANG management approximately 30 days to review and possibly revise its position on the
issue(s) in dispute. When the differences cannot be resolved, the AFAA ANG Representative
will forward the audit report along with the ANG comments to HQ AFAA/DOO for resolution.
