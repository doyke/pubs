This supplement implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-501,
Program Action Directives (PAD) and Programming Plans (PPlan). This supplement describes Air
Force Space Command’s (AFSPC) procedures for use in conjunction with the basic AFI. It provides
policy and delineates staff responsibilities to develop, publish and control programming plans (PPlan)
for basing actions associated with the activation, inactivation, realignment or transfer of AFSPC
installations and/or units and major system acquisitions and/or conversions. It also describes the
management structure, called a Project Task Force (PROTAF), which should be used for all basing
actions. The PPlan guidance provided in this supplement may also be used as guidance by AFSPC
wings to develop, publish and control wing-level implementation plans (IPlan). See Attachment 1 for
terms used in this instruction. This supplement applies to HQ AFSPC, its personnel, resources and
subordinate units. It does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) nor Air National Guard
(ANG) units. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication;
route AF IMT 847s from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance
with AFMAN33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This supplement is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision updates
office symbols and clarifies MAJCOM PPlan and establishes Wing IPlan responsibilities.

3. Objective of a PPLAN. PPlans are developed when multiple functional areas must be involved in
accomplishing an approved basing action. PPlans are rescinded when all Time Phased Actions are
complete or the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for the project requests rescission.
2                                                AFI10-501_AFSPCSUP 20 JANUARY 2009


3.2. (Added) Programming Message (PMsg). When the scope of an action is significantly
smaller than that requiring a complete PPlan, a PMsg is used. The AFSPC office of collateral
responsibility (OCR) for PPlans, HQ AFSPC/A8IB, determines when a PMsg is appropriate.
6.1. The guidance for developing AFSPC PPlans for basing decisions is as follows: (NOTE: For
other PPlans, see paragraph 6.1.7. (Added)):
6.1.1. (Added) When To Prepare an AFSPC PPlan:
6.1.1.1. (Added) An AFSPC PPlan is required when a basing decision results in a significant
change in force structure or mission affecting two or more organizations. Examples of basing
decisions include: base closure actions, major system acquisitions and/or conversions, standup of
a new unit, movement of a unit or mission from one installation to another, or a significant
change to an existing unit or mission.
6.1.1.2. (Added) HQ AFSPC agencies will submit requests for AFSPC PPlans to HQ AFSPC
Bases and Units Branch (A8IB), the AFSPC PPlan OCR.
6.1.2. (Added) Format. The format for an AFSPC PPlan is contained in the PPlan Guide at
Attachment 4 (Added). AFSPC PPlans are serially numbered by fiscal year; for example, 0X-
01, 0X-02, etc. HQ AFSPC/A8IB only assigns PPlan numbers for documents originated by the
HQ AFSPC staff.
6.1.3. (Added) Responsibilities:
6.1.3.1. (Added) HQ AFSPC Basing and International Affairs Division (A8I) will:
6.1.3.1.1. (Added) Monitor the United States Air Force Program Document and determine the
need for a PPlan to implement directed and authorized changes in force structure. Coordinate
proposed force structure changes through HQ AFSPC/PA to ensure appropriate congressional
announcements and public release are initiated.
6.1.3.1.2. (Added) Determine the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for HQ AFSPC PPlans.
The OPR is the command proponent of the action for the proposed program. HQ AFSPC/A8IB is
the PPlan OCR and OPR for the site survey, beddown, and PROTAF processes in accordance
with AFI10-503_AFSPCSUP, Base Unit Beddown Program. The PPlan OPR will assign
management responsibility to a program manager who is familiar with the objective of the
programming document and has a working knowledge of the functional areas that will
participate in its development and execution. The program manager must provide his or her
name, grade, office symbol, and telephone number to HQ AFSPC/A8IB. Program managers for
new acquisition normally reside in HQ AFSPC Directorate of Requirements (A5).
6.1.3.1.3. (Added) HQ AFSPC/A8IB. Process PPlan requests from other HQ AFSPC staff
agencies. Develop guidance and provide information to all applicable Directors for their use in
the definition of project requirements and development of a pertinent PPlan and or annexes to a
PPlan. Review and coordinate the PPlan and arrange for printing and distributing the final
PPlan. Serves as PROTAF manager unless management by another Director would enhance
implementation. (In the event of an impasse, HQ AFSPC/CV directs which directorate provides
PROTAF manager.) Act as advisor for the planning process and is the office for central review
to identify programming conflicts among headquarters elements.
6.1.3.2. (Added) HQ AFSPC Directors. Ensure directorate coordination is timely and complete.
Coordinate on the SSS during final staff review. All Directors requiring programming plans
notify the HQ AFSPC/A8I as soon as a requirement is known.
6.1.3.3. (Added) Participating HQ AFSPC Functional Staff Agencies. Appoint project officers
to:
 AFI10-501_AFSPCSUP 20 JANUARY 2009                                                            3


6.1.3.3.1. (Added) Furnish information needed to develop a draft basic plan to implement HQ
AFSPC-generated programs.
6.1.3.3.2. (Added) Attend planning conferences, conduct internal staff agency meetings to
review the basic plan and develop supporting functional staff annexes.
6.1.3.3.3. (Added) Coordinate with their respective staff agency, with other HQ AFSPC staff
agencies and with counterparts in non-AFSPC agencies when those agencies are affected by their
respective annex or time-phased actions.
6.1.3.3.4. (Added) Furnish finished staff annexes, appendixes and a list of time-phased actions
for the draft PPlan.
6.1.3.3.5. (Added) Monitor the status of subordinate unit time-phased actions and help resolve
problems as required.
6.1.3.3.6. (Added) Monitor the status of their time-phased actions and submit progress reports to
the PPlan OPR.
6.1.3.3.7. (Added) Monitor the adequacy and currency of their respective functional staff
annexes and submit corrections or changes to PPlan OPR for publication.
6.1.3.4. (Added) AFSPC PPlans are prepared by the program manager (appointed by the PPlan
OPR) and HQ AFSPC/A8IB and approved by HQ AFSPC Director of Plans, Programs and
Analyses (A8/9) unless delegated otherwise. The program manager is responsible for completing
the PPlan Development Checklist and in coordination with the PPlan OCR, drafting the
PROTAF E-Staffing Tasker. The program manager is also responsible for development of the
PPlan: Basic Plan, Annex A, and their appropriate functional annex (See PPlan Guide,
Attachment 4(Added) of this supplement for additional information.) Program managers will
not publish or distribute PPlans or changes thereto without HQ AFSPC/A8/9 approval. The
program manager reviews progress reports from the field for items that require action and
coordinates with the responsible agency within the Headquarters to resolve problems.
6.1.3.5. (Added) AFSPC PPlans are directive on AFSPC organizations and any other affected
organizations. Tracking PPlan taskings is the specific responsibility of the program manager of
the PPlan. When the PPlan objective is fulfilled and all taskings are complete, the program
manager will notify HQ AFSPC/A8I who will formally rescind the PPlan with a memo or
message to the applicable staff agencies.
6.1.3.6. (Added) The HQ AFSPC /A8IB point of contact for the proposed program will schedule
and conduct the site visits, site surveys, and PROTAF visits as required and is the command
representative (team chief) for these actions. He or she will also assist the program manager in
completing, coordinating, and editing the PPlan.
6.1.4. (Added) Authority. For applicability, review the basic AFI; AFI 16-403, Updating the
USAF Program Installations, Units, and Priorities and Movement of Air Force Units. An
action involving a unit move requires a movement directive according to AFI 16-403.
6.1.5. (Added) Environmental:
6.1.5.1. (Added) The program manager (proponent) should promptly initiate an environmental
impact analysis for all proposed actions in conjunction with PPlan development. AFI 32-7001,
Environmental Budgeting, applies to both continental United States (CONUS) and overseas
actions.
6.1.5.2. (Added) All actions require submission of an AF IMT 813, Request for Environmental
Impact Analysis, to the host environmental planning function for review and final disposition. If
the action is on a non-AFSPC base, the proponent must request the host environmental planning
function initiate the environmental impact analysis process by submitting the AF IMT 813.
4                                                  AFI10-501_AFSPCSUP 20 JANUARY 2009


Within AFSPC, the environmental planning function is in HQ AFSPC/A4/7PP. The proponent
must state in the PPlan that the environmental impact analysis has begun and indicate its status at
the time of PPlan publication. The proponent will make the AF IMT 813 available for review
during the entire planning and review phase and notify annex managers of its final disposition.
6.1.6. (Added) AFSPC Bases. The commander’s staff at an AFSPC base will use this
supplement as a guide for preparing a base-level Implementation Plan (IPlan). Where required by
a PPlan AFSPC bases must prepare an IPlan in support of said PPlan. AFSPC bases may also
prepare an IPlan as required to meet base level needs without an existing PPlan. AFSPC bases
are authorized to develop IPlans with their tenant organizations as required.
6.1.7. (Added) HQ AFSPC Directorates and Organizations. HQ AFSPC directorates and
organizations may use this PPlan format as a guide for developing AFSPC planning documents
for programs not involving basing decisions. These planning documents will be signed by the
OPR’s director or commander and be processed through HQ AFSPC/A8I for issuance of an
AFSPC PPlan number and entry into the PPlan log.
6.1.8. (Added) Management of Reports:
6.1.8.1. (Added) Progress Reports. Participating commanders and headquarters staff agencies
submit progress updates according to instructions in each PPlan. Each reporting agency submits
reports until all its actions are completed. Reference the PPlan number and title, using the format
provided in the Sample Progress Report contained in the PPlan Guide at Attachment 4 (Added),
on all correspondence including progress reports covering a PPlan.
6.1.8.2. (Added) Status of Action Items. Progress reports indicate status of all time-phased
action items initiated or scheduled. Completed actions will be reported as complete and deleted
from follow-on reports.
6.1.8.3. (Added) Consolidation of Reports. HQ AFSPC staff agencies consolidate reports on
time-phased actions at the Director or equivalent staff agency level. The consolidated report is
sent to the PPlan OPR to arrive before the due date specified in the PPlan.
6.1.8.4. (Added) Normal Staff Actions. Progress reports do not replace normal channels for
requesting higher echelon help. When a problem that causes a delay, or threatens to cause a delay
is identified, action agencies at all levels should take the appropriate corrective action or request
help from the command OPR to correct the problem.
6.3. (Added) Adopted Forms:
AF813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis

Terms
Annex - A major subdivision of a PPlan prepared by a functional staff agency. An annex
contains enough detail to stand alone. It establishes the tasks and procedures which the
functional agency must complete to attain the basic plan's objective. If a formal annex is not
necessary, the Director may submit a paragraph of functional area instructions to be included in
the basic plan.
Appendix - A subdivision of an annex providing additional detail, such as time-phased actions,
for a functional subarea.
Basic Plan - The PPlan OPR (with assistance from the PPlan OCR) writes the Basic Plan. It
contains the purpose, authority, references, participating organizations, program guidance,
background, responsibilities, milestones and program management of the Plan. If possible, the
Basic Plan is distributed to the PPlan project officers at or before the first working group
meeting.
Changes - After the PPlan is signed, changes, clarification, etc., to an annex or appendix may
only be added after written coordination through the PPlan OPR and OCR. The best time to
recommend changes is during three-letter and two-letter coordination.
Distribution - PPlan OPR prepares Annex Z which lists final distribution of PPlan. At a
minimum, distribution is made to HQ AF/A7CIB, MAJCOM directorates and affected
Wing/CCs.
Event - An action needed to complete a milestone.
Formal Change - A published PPlan change sent to all distribution addressees.
Functional Area POC - Identifies and monitors all actions needed within a functional area to
accomplish the project on time. Develops functional area PPlan annex. Tracks, assesses and
oversees status of action items to meet project milestones. Reviews and coordinates action item
status lists within functional area. Provides status to PPlan OPR.
Joint Programming Plan - A coordinated intercommand document which defines program
objectives in detail and identifies and assigns intercommand staff responsibilities and ensures
future actions are completed on time. The Director of Plans, or equivalent, of each participating
organization signs the final Basic PPlan.

Milestone - A major event which is of primary importance to the program accomplishment.
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) - A designated staff office that develops and manages
a PPlan. An overall command functional OPR is designated for each PPlan. The OPR is the
command proponent of the action for the proposed program. The PPlan OPR will assign
management responsibility to a program manager who is familiar with the objective of the
programming document and has a working knowledge of the functional areas that will
participate in its development and execution. The program manager must provide his or her
name, grade, office symbol, and telephone number to HQ AFSPC/A8IB. Additionally,
participating HQ AFSPC staff agencies are OPRs for their respective functional annexes which
support the objectives and guidance in the basic plan.
Programming Plan (PPLAN). - Functional staff agencies are responsible for additional
requirements which may or may not be specifically addressed in a PPlan but are related to or
arise from the intent of the plan. Each agency is responsible for developing detailed action plans,
as necessary, which supplement HQ AFSPC PPlans to ensure successful execution of the PPlan.
A PPlan provides broad guidance to accomplish a particular one-time, non-recurring project
(e.g., unit relocation, system acquisition/beddown, or base closure or drawdown). It documents
the project's objective and actions necessary for implementation. PPlan content may vary
depending on the type of action involved. PPlans identify essential actions (for example:
personnel actions, delivery schedule of new unit equipment, essential facilities required and
available, logistics and sustainment activities) to accomplish a program. A PPlan is a
coordinated document which identifies staff actions and assigns staff responsibilities for defining
program objectives in detail and for making sure future actions are completed on time. A
Programming Message (PMsg) is a condensed PPlan in message format. It will be used when
the scope of an action is significantly smaller than that requiring a complete PPlan.
Development and coordination of a PMsg is identical for that of a PPlan in accordance with this
supplement. For any given action, HQ AFSPC/A8I will determine whether to use a PPlan or
PMsg. When acquiring an installation from another command, the gaining command is
responsible for preparation of the PPlan. Write a PPlan as soon as enough information is
available and authority exists (e.g.: Approved CONOPS, Manpower and Funding approved in
POM).
Project - A set of activities and a schedule required to accomplish a one-time undertaking of
limited duration (normally two years or less) such as a base closure, unit transfer or inactivation,
or system beddown.
Project Officers - Individuals selected within each staff agency to develop and manage an
element of a PPlan. Each project officer reviews the entire PPlan for additions and corrections,
prepares required data, coordinates with all appropriate agencies and provides inputs in the
approved format to the PPlan OPR.
PROTAF - A Project Task Force is a project management group convened to identify and
coordinate actions required to accomplish the objectives of a specific project. The Bases and
Units Branch (HQ AFSPC/A8IB), as the command OCR for preparing PPlans and the command
OPR for PROTAF management, orchestrates the diverse efforts of functional area working
groups and PROTAF representatives to keep the project and its timeline on track.
Revised PPlan - A completely new PPlan which replaces a previously published PPlan of the
same number and subject.
 AFI10-501_AFSPCSUP 20 JANUARY 2009                                                       7


Time-Phased Action (TPA) - An action required in a specified time to support the plan. Time-
phased actions are contained as an appendix to the functional annex and are numbered
sequentially beginning with number one.

PPLAN IMPLEMENTATION/ADMINISTRATION

The actions listed below can occur at any time throughout the life cycle of the PPlan. They can
also occur more than once. The list of actions does not cover all the potential problems which
may be encountered, but does provide information on the most common situations.

-    The PPlan OPR ensures the Functional OPRs comply with required Progress/Revision
     Reports. The due date is noted in the Basic Plan. The Functional OPRs are the individuals
     responsible for keeping the PPlan OPR informed of their activities. If reports are overdue,
     call the individual first and follow up with an e-mail to help remind them.

-    The PPlan OPR ensures all PPlan actions are progressing satisfactorily. If not, ask the
     Functional OPR to resolve the problem and or report the problem up the chain of command.
     The PPlan will work only if all members of the team work together. This means keeping the
     rest of the team informed of potential slips or problems. Communication is the key to
     success. See the reporting instructions. (Example - Atch 8)

MAKING CHANGES TO THE PPLAN

Functional OPRs send a signed copy of recommended changes to the PPlan OPR. The PPlan
OPR in coordination with the PPlan OCR initiates the PPlan change for Director of Plans,
Programs and Analyses signature.

-    For minimal changes, Director of Plans, Programs and Analyses may sign out a change
     letter.
-    For major changes, the entire PPlan may need to be recoordinated and redistributed.

RESCINDING THE PPLAN
The PPlan OPR notifies the PPlan OCR when the primary objectives of the PPlan have been
completed and remaining open time phased activities can be accomplished through normal staff
actions. A letter of rescindment is initiated by the PPlan OCR, signed by HQ AFSPC/A8I and
sent to all addressees on the PPlan distribution list. This letter signifies that all actions have been
completed. (Example - Atch 9)

8. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT:

     8.1. This PPlan provides basic guidance for implementing the actions specified in PAD 08-
          XY realign Mission XYZ and equipment to Vandenberg AFB. Functional POCs are
          required to monitor actions directed in the PPlan to ensure timely completion.

        8.1.1. HQ AFSPC/A8IB will coordinate and publish the PPlan. The basic plan,
               functional annexes and associated time-phased actions reflect major tasks to be
               accomplished. The PPlan will ensure the Command actions required are
               identified, enumerated, reviewed, coordinated, programmed and implemented.
               The signed PPlan will be distributed via E-mail.

        8.1.2. Functional staff agencies will accomplish specified time-phased actions.

        8.1.3. Functional staff agencies are responsible for additional requirements that may not
               be specifically addressed in this PPlan but are related to or arise from the intent of
               the plan.

        8.1.4. Direct coordination between participating agencies is authorized.

        8.1.5   Any disagreements concerning plan implementation will be documented and
                routed through respective chains of command for review/resolution.

     8.2. HQ AFSPC functional OPRs are responsible for the programmed objectives of this
          PPlan. Each affected directorate will designate—and update within 30 days of any
          change—a functional OPR to act as the single POC and project officer for the
          directorate. Project officer appointments are reflected in Appendix I to the Basic Plan.
          HQ AFSPC project officers will:

        8.2.1. Prepare annexes/time-phased actions for this PPlan. Annexes will clearly state
               the tasks and timelines required for the realignment and facility construction. If
               required, attach an appendix to the annex detailing time-phased actions and events
               to be accomplished to meet objectives of this plan.
