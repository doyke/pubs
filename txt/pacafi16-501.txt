1. Overview. The HQ PACAF Corporate Structure outlines and facilitates the corporate review
process for HQ PACAF. This structure provides the framework within which to review
command-wide issues from a corporate viewpoint and maximizes decision-making effectiveness.
The corporate structure also provides a forum where senior PACAF leaders can apply their
collective judgment and experience to affect major programs, processes, policies, objectives, and
resource allocations. HQ PACAF Corporate Structure membership will take precedence over all
other routine functions.
2. Composition. The HQ PACAF Corporate Structure is comprised of several formal executive
groups chartered to handle various key resource issues and develop command positions.
Processes conducted within the HQ PACAF Corporate Structure framework are detailed in the
attachments and include but are not limited to: the PACAF Program Objective Memorandum
(POM) submission (Attachment 2); the Budget Formulation and Execution Oversight Process
(Attachment 3); the PACAF Military Construction (MILCON) and MAJCOM Comprehensive
PACAFI16-501 20 JUNE 2014                                                                       3


Asset Management Plan (MCAMP) submission (Attachment 4); the PACAF Capability Gaps
Integrated Priority List (IPL) submission and Core Function Lead (CFL) coordination
(Attachment 5); and the PACAF Command and Control (C2)/Cyber Requirements submission
(Attachment 6). Future attachments may include a corporate Strategy and Planning process,
manpower drills, and any other processes that process owners feel would benefit from a
corporate review.
3. Organization.
   3.1. The HQ PACAF Corporate Structure is comprised of the PACAF Working Group
   (PWG), PACAF Group (PG), PACAF Board (PB), and the PACAF Council (PC). The basic
   HQ PACAF Corporate Structure is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. HQ PACAF Corporate Structure




   3.2. Normally, issues are sequentially elevated through the corporate structure as illustrated
   in figure 1 (that is, options/issues start at the working group level and then proceed through
   the PG, PB, and PC levels). Exceptions: when a subject matter chair determines that
   efficiency or timeline warrants a level be bypassed or finalized via electronic or other means.
   3.3. Any changes to an approved PC position must be vetted again through the HQ PACAF
   Corporate Structure to assess its consistency with respect to PACAF strategy or other
   PACAF requirements.

  5.1. The PWG is the entry level into the corporate structure. It provides initial data
  collection and begins the process of planning, identifying requirements, resource allocation,
  and consideration of other issues prior to the O-6-level review. The PWG reviews issues and
  decisions submitted by stakeholders (Mission/Mission Support Panel POCs, Service Core
  Function (SCF) integrators, Program Element (PE) POCs, Subject Matter Experts (SMEs),
  Resource Advisors (RAs), etc.) and forwards significant issues to the PG.

     5.2.1. Membership normally consists of branch chiefs or Action Officer (AO)-level
     Mission/Mission Support Panel POCs, PE POCs, SMEs, RAs, etc., depending on the

     represent the division staff's view on issues presented to or reviewed by the PWG.
6. PACAF Group (PG).
  6.1. The PG is the second level of the corporate structure, providing O-6/senior-
  level/division chief resolution of issues prior to the PB. Topics brought before the PG should
  be limited to matters that require corporate consideration and resolution.
  6.2. An approved PG position constitutes division-level PACAF staff coordination on all
  resource management issues addressed.
  6.3. The PG will review PWG inputs and make decisions/recommendations to the PB.
  Beyond the PG, issues no longer are represented by Panels, but by directorate, to present
  balanced HQ-wide consideration.
  6.4. Membership normally consists of PACAF Division Chiefs. Others will be included as
  appropriate for the specific process. See attachments for specific voting membership.
 6                                                               PACAFI16-501 20 JUNE 2014


     6.5. A deputy will attend in the incumbent's absence. Because members may need to discuss
     topics of a privileged nature requiring candid discussion, attendance will normally be
     restricted to members. Others will attend by invitation of Group members.
7. PACAF Board (PB).
     7.1. The PB provides director-level and Personal Staff chief-level review of issues prior to
     the PC. Topics brought before the PB should be limited to matters that require director-level
     corporate consideration and resolution.
     7.2. The PB shapes and refines proposals prior to presentation to the PC. Significant Board
     issues and decisions are briefed to the PC. In addition, the PB has decision-making authority
     over issues submitted by the PG.
     7.3. Voting membership normally consists of PACAF Directors. Personal Staff, Numbered
     Air Forces (NAFs), and others will be included as appropriate for the specific process, per
     the attachments.
     7.4. A deputy will attend in the incumbent's absence. Because members may need to discuss
     topics of a privileged nature requiring candid discussion, attendance will normally be
     restricted to members. Others will attend by invitation of Board members.
     7.5. When warranted by topics concerning the Air Reserve Components, the respective
     component’s advisor may attend (e.g., HQ PACAF/RG for issues regarding the ANG).
     7.6. The directorate responsible for the issue being presented to/reviewed by the PB is
     responsible for completion of assigned taskings, unless otherwise determined by the PB.
8. PACAF Council (PC).
     8.1. The PC is the commander’s executive advisory committee.
     8.2. The PACAF Commander (HQ PACAF/CC) is the Council chairperson and might
     delegate responsibilities and final approving authority to the HQ PACAF Vice Commander
     (PACAF/CV) or Chief of Staff (PACAF/CS).
     8.3. Membership normally consists of PACAF Directors. Personal Staff, NAFs, and others
     will be included as appropriate for the specific process, per the attachments. Membership for
     the PB and PC are normally the same; the PB is intended to be a deliberative/approving
     body, whereas the PC is advisory to the chairperson.
     8.4. A deputy will attend in the incumbent's absence. Because members may need to discuss
     topics of a privileged nature requiring candid discussion, attendance will normally be
     restricted to members. Others will attend by invitation of Council members.
     8.5. When warranted by topics concerning the Air Reserve Components, the respective
     component’s advisor may attend (e.g., HQ PACAF/RE for AFRC issues).
     8.6. The directorate responsible for the issue being presented/reviewed by the PC is
     responsible for completion of assigned taskings, unless otherwise determined by the PC.
PACAFI16-501 20 JUNE 2014                                                                     7


9. Administrative Requirements for PACAF Working Group, Group, Board, and Council
Meetings.
   9.1. Scheduling Meetings. The process-owning POC (see attachments) will schedule the
   PWG, PG, and PB meetings and coordinate with the command section for scheduling the PC
   meetings. After the POC coordinates a meeting location, date, and time, he/she will notify
   the HQ PACAF Corporate Structure members of the meeting via Microsoft Outlook calendar
   invite.
   9.2. Briefing Slides (Read-aheads). Process owners are responsible for the distribution of
   electronic copies of the briefing slides to members, and posting briefing slides to the
   appropriate SharePoint site, at least one full duty day prior to PWG, PG, PB, and PC
   meetings.
   9.3. Pre-briefs.
      9.3.1. PC meetings pre-briefs will be made available for HQ PACAF/CC/CV/CS.
      9.3.2. Present pre-briefs at least one duty day prior to the PC meetings, if possible.
      Taskings from the pre-brief will be the responsibility of the process owners.
      9.3.3. Provide an electronic copy of the briefing slides (read-aheads) at least one duty
      day before the pre-brief to the HQ PACAF command section. If critical items have
      changed since the PB meeting, those changes should first be coordinated through the PB
      members.
   9.4. Attendance at Meetings. HQ PACAF Corporate Structure meetings take precedence
   over other routine staff duties. Because members may need to discuss topics of a privileged
   nature requiring candid discussion, attendance will normally be restricted to members. When
   authorized by the PG or PB member, Mission/Mission Support Panel POCs, PE POCs,
   SMEs, RAs, etc. (corporate structure stakeholders) who directly support the issues being
   presented/reviewed may attend meetings/briefings.
   9.5. Documentation. Each process owner is responsible for coordinating and tracking
   action items and decisions generated from each corporate structure event (PWG, PG, PB, and
   PC). Issues will be elevated to the next higher level in the HQ PACAF Corporate Structure
   only after being approved by the activity chairperson and membership, or when called
   forward by the chairperson or convening authority at the next higher level. The POC will
   also produce and keep record files including, but not limited to, schedules, briefing slides,
   decisions, and status of action items.
   9.6. Naming Convention. To help formalize and promote consistency within the corporate
   process board meetings, the following naming convention will be used: each corporate
   structure board meeting (PWG, PG, etc.) will be preceded by the function being addressed,
   e.g. Programming PWG, Budget/Execution PB, MCAMP PC, etc.

   tasks personnel and agencies across the PACAF Staff, as required. HQ PACAF/A5/8 is the
   spokesperson for PACAF on all programming issues. As owner of the programming process
   (see Figure A2.1.), HQ PACAF/A5/8 chairs the Programming PB meetings and pre-briefs
   PACAF CC/CV/CS prior to all Programming PC meetings. HQ PACAF/A5/8 briefs the
   Programming PC on the Programming PB positions.

  A2.1.2. The PACAF POM conveys PACAF needs and priorities to the Air Staff. These
  needs are informed by PACAF’s Strategic Plan and published programming guidance
  developed at various levels of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), AF, and
  PACAF. PACAF programming guidance reflects HQ PACAF/CC strategy, priorities, and
  rules of engagement in concert with various USAF and OSD documents. Once applicable
  guidance is available, HQ PACAF/A8P distributes to applicable parties. Source documents
  for programming guidance include, but are not limited to, the Strategic Planning Guidance
  (SPG), the Joint Programming Guidance (JPG), various HQ USAF Memoranda, HQ USAF
  POM Preparation Instructions (PPIs), and US Pacific Command (USPACOM) and other
  Combatant Commanders’ Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).
  A2.1.3. For program consistency and clarity, it is essential that any unique programming
  guidance forwarded to PACAF through functional channels be immediately sent to HQ
  PACAF/A8P for review and inclusion into overall PACAF programming
  instructions/guidance. The approved PACAF POM submission must reflect a good-faith
  effort to accomplish the PACAF mission within available funding and with no excesses or
  inefficiencies.
  A2.1.4. Programming PWG.
     A2.1.4.1. The Programming PWG provides the first cross-functional review and critique
     of the draft PACAF portion of the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). It is also the
     initial step in validation of program disconnects and initiatives and the driving force in
     risk assessment for the identification of proposed offsets to balance command priorities
     within fiscal constraints. The efforts of this group provide the foundation of a successful
     PACAF POM build and resulting FYDP. The working group is empowered to task
     personnel and agencies across the staff.
     A2.1.4.2. The Programming PWG is chaired by HQ PACAF/A8PE and consists of HQ
     PACAF/A8PE programming personnel, Mission/Mission Support Panel POCs, PE POCs,
     and SMEs as required.
     A2.1.4.3. PWG voting membership is proffered to the following offices: HQ
     PACAF/A1SR, A1MP, A2XR, A3TV, A3OA, A4PP, A5IO, A6XB, A7RI, A8XI, A8PE,
     and FMAO.
     A2.1.4.4. Service Core Function (SCF) Panel POCs.
         A2.1.4.4.1. Panel POCs serve as the entry point into PACAF directorates at all levels
         of the program build. They are essential to ensure continuity as the process builds
         and transitions through the PWG, PG, PB, PC, and final approval from HQ
         PACAF/CC.
         A2.1.4.4.2. Panel POCs with support from PE POCs and SMEs are expected to brief
         the PWG. Panel POCs as well as all members of the Programming PWG are critical
         links in the overall PACAF programming process. Managers of PEs are responsible
         for all issues affecting their PE and are considered the experts for any information
         concerning their PE. They ensure Directorate/Division initiatives, disconnects, and
         offsets are appropriately allocated, adequately justified, fully validated, and properly
         submitted (supported by facers, tri-charts, and Resource Allocation Programming
         Information Decision System (RAPIDS)).
PACAFI16-501 20 JUNE 2014                                                                13


          A2.1.4.4.3. Panels are divided into two major categories: Mission Panels and
          Mission Support Panels. PACAF Panel chairs are at the Division Chief level and
          supported by the respective directorate (see Table A2.1.).

          A2.1.4.4.4. Panel POCs must remain in constant contact with their
          Directorate/Division/Branch leadership, HQ PACAF/A8P programmers, other
          MAJCOMs, and Air Staff Program Element Monitors (PEMs)/Panels throughout
          PACAF POM development. This contact is critical to the identification and
          coordinated resolution of questions and concerns relating to the PACAF submitted
          inputs and ensuring the HQ PACAF/A8P staff is up to date as they work to provide
          continuous status of PACAF POM activities to HQ PACAF/A5/8 and PACAF
          leadership.
          A2.1.4.4.5. After Panel POCs, with the support of PE POCs and SMEs, identify their
          individual PE disconnects, initiatives, and offsets, the Programming PWG then
          develops a strawman PACAF POM submission in accordance with PACAF
          programming policy, guidance, and established priority lists. The strawman PACAF
          POM submission is a prioritized, integrated list of all validated disconnects and
          initiatives plus a prioritized list of recommended offsets. Working group members
          then prepare their respective PG members prior to the next phase of the program
          build. HQ PACAF/A8PE will brief the PG of the proposed PACAF POM position
          developed by the Programming PWG.

     A6X, A7R, A8P, A8X, and FMA.
     A2.1.5.3. The Programming PG reviews inputs from the Programming PWG and
     conducts its own program review, actively seeking additional data as required. Based on
     this review, the Programming PG validates and prioritizes requirements and offsets. The
     Programming PG is responsible for submitting a proposed PACAF POM to the
     Programming PB that complies with HQ PACAF/CC strategy and Air Staff guidance.
  A2.1.6. Programming PB.
     A2.1.6.1. After requirements and offsets are validated and prioritized, a proposed
     integrated program is produced for deliberation by the Programming PB. PG
     members/Panel POCs/PE POCs/SMEs prepare their Directors for the Programming PB
     meeting and provide advice/inputs on any out-of-cycle programming issues that may
     arise.
     A2.1.6.2. HQ PACAF/A8P briefs HQ PACAF/A5/8 on the proposed command position
     prior to presentation to the Programming PB and briefs the Programming PB on behalf of
     the Programming PG.
     A2.1.6.3. The Programming PB membership consists of PACAF Directors. Personal

   PACAF BUDGET FORMULATION AND EXECUTION OVERSIGHT PROCESS

A3.1. Budget Formulation and Execution Oversight.
   A3.1.1. The Director, Financial Management and Comptroller (HQ PACAF/FM), is the
   corporate owner for PACAF O&M budget formulation and budget execution oversight
   process. Accordingly, HQ PACAF/FM initiates the budget formulation and execution
   oversight, facilitates and guides the process, ensures funding issues are resolved, and tasks
   personnel and agencies across the PACAF Staff, as required. HQ PACAF/FM is the
   spokesperson for PACAF on all O&M budget and execution year financial issues. HQ
   PACAF/FM chairs the Budget/Execution PB meetings and pre-briefs CC/CV prior to all
   Budget/Execution PC meetings on financial issues.
   A3.1.2. HQ PACAF/FM develops an Execution Plan (ExPlan) to convey PACAF
   requirements and priorities to the Air Staff. These requirements are framed within PACAF’s
   Strategic Plan and published financial guidance developed at various levels of OSD, AF, and
   PACAF. PACAF financial guidance reflects HQ PACAF/CC strategy and priorities in
   conjunction with various USAF and OSD documents. Once applicable guidance is available,
   HQ PACAF Financial Analyst Division (HQ PACAF/FMA) distributes to all applicable
   parties. The approved ExPlan must reflect a good faith effort to accomplish the PACAF
   mission within available funding. During the execution year, Air Staff may request an
   execution review to address program changes and/or unfunded requirements. The remaining
   unfunded requirements are validated and prioritized at the end of the fiscal year, and funded
   based on funds availability.
   A3.1.3. Budget/Execution PWG.
      A3.1.3.1. The Budget/Execution PWG provides the first cross-functional review and
      critique of the PACAF ExPlan, Initial Distribution, Operating Budget Review
      Committees (OBRCs), and End-of-Year prioritization processes.
      A3.1.3.2. The Budget/Execution PWG serves two functions, and is therefore convened
      in two formats: the ExPlan PWG for future year ExPlans and the Budget/Execution
      PWG for current year execution.
          A3.1.3.2.1. The ExPlan PWG is responsible to develop the future year ExPlan at the
          appropriate Panel level for submission to the PG. HQ PACAF/FMAO chairs the
          ExPlan PWG and its voting membership (see Table A3.1.) includes the lead Panel
          POCs as depicted in Table A2.1., in alignment with HQ PACAF/A8 processes.
          A3.1.3.2.2. The Budget/Execution PWG is responsible to review/validate
          requirements throughout the year of execution, as needed, in order to provide a
          recommendation to the Budget/Execution PG. HQ PACAF/FMAO chairs the
          Budget/Execution PWG and its voting membership includes Directorate and Personal
          Staff RAs (see Table A3.1.).
      A3.1.3.3. HQ PACAF/A8P and HQ PACAF/JA serve as advisors for                           all
      budget/execution issues/recommendations throughout the PWG, PG, PB, and PC.
18                                                           PACAFI16-501 20 JUNE 2014


     A3.1.3.4. The efforts of the Budget/Execution PWG provide the foundation of a
     successful PACAF budget formulation and execution process. The Budget/Execution
     PWG conducts a detailed review of all PACAF financial planning/execution activities
     and is empowered to task personnel and agencies across the staff. This stage of review is
     the initial step in validation of command inputs, including unfunded requirements, and
     recommendations and the driving force in risk assessment for the identification of
     proposed offsets to balance command priorities within fiscal constraints. The
     Budget/Execution PWG builds a strawman financial program in accordance with PACAF
     financial guidance and established initial priority lists. The strawman program is a
     prioritized, integrated list of all validated requirements, recommended funding levels,
     unfunded requirements, and recommended distribution. The HQ PACAF/FMAO will
     brief the Budget/Execution PWG results to the Budget/Execution PG.
     A3.1.3.5. Mission/Mission Support Panel Point of Contact (POC).
        A3.1.3.5.1. Directorate/Division Mission/Mission Support Panel POCs are critical
        links in the overall PACAF financial process. Panel POCs serve as the entry point
        into PACAF Directorates at all levels of the financial process. They are key to ensure
        continuity as the process develops and transitions from the Wing and SME inputs
        through the Budget/Execution PWG, PG, PB, PC, and HQ PACAF/CC.
        A3.1.3.5.2. Panel POCs must remain in constant contact with the directorate SMEs,
        RAs, HQ PACAF/FMA analysts, other MAJCOMs, and Air Staff SMEs/Panels
        throughout the AF budget formulation and execution process. This contact is critical
        to the identification and coordinated resolution of questions and concerns relating to
        the PACAF submitted ExPlan and execution process as well as ensuring the HQ
        PACAF/FMA staff is up to date as they work to provide continuous status of financial
        activities to the HQ PACAF/FM and PACAF leadership.
        A3.1.3.5.3. Appointed Directorate/Division Mission/Mission Support Panel POCs
        with support of PE POCs, SMEs, and RAs are responsible for all financial issues
        affecting their PE(s), and are considered the experts for all information and
        requirements validation concerning their respective PE(s).
        A3.1.3.5.4. Subject Matter Experts (SME) identify program funding levels,
        distribution, unfunded requirements, and sources to be considered during the budget
        formulation and execution process. The SMEs provide validation of NAF, Wing, and
        Headquarters requirements via the Life Cycle Budget Tool (LCBT) and ensure
        ExPlan requirements are validated for funding in a manner consistent with the
        approved HQ PACAF/CC strategy and priorities IAW HQ PACAF/FM guidance.
  A3.1.4. Budget/Execution PG.
     A3.1.4.1. The Budget/Execution PG, chaired by HQ PACAF/FMA, is comprised of
     Division Chief, or O-6/O-5-level representation, from across the HQ PACAF A-Staff,
     Personal Staff, and NAFs, and is responsible for submitting proposed PACAF budget
     products to the Budget/Execution PB that comply with HQ PACAF/CC and Air Staff
     guidance.
     A3.1.4.2. The Budget/Execution PG also provides advice/inputs on any out of cycle
     funding issues that may arise. The Budget/Execution PG reviews the Budget/Execution
PACAFI16-501 20 JUNE 2014                                                                    19


        PWG recommendations and conducts its own program review, actively seeking
        additional data as required. Based on this review, the Budget/Execution PG validates and
        prioritizes all requirements and suggested sources for unfunded requirements, then
        produces a proposed integrated financial program for deliberation by the
        Budget/Execution PB.
        A3.1.4.3. The Budget/Execution PG voting membership includes a single representative
        from each Directorate and DCS, representing the Personal Staff (see Table A3.1.).
        NAFs, RG and RE at the Division Chief level (3-digit) may be included as appropriate.
   A3.1.5. Budget/Execution PB. Budget/Execution PG members/Panel POCs/RAs/SMEs
   prepare their respective Deputy Directors prior to the Budget/Execution PB meeting. HQ
   PACAF/FMA           briefs     HQ        PACAF/FM          on      proposed      funding

 PACAF MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND MAJCOM COMPREHENSIVE ASSET
                  MANAGEMENT PLAN PROCESSES

A4.1. Military Construction (MILCON)             and    MAJCOM        Comprehensive       Asset
Management Plan (MCAMP) Programs
  A4.1.1. The PACAF Civil Engineer (HQ PACAF/A7) is the corporate owner of the PACAF
  MILCON (except medical and DoD Education Activities MILCON) and MCAMP
  programming processes and has primary responsibility for ensuring timely and complete
  MILCON and MCAMP program submission. Accordingly, HQ PACAF/A7 initiates
  MILCON and MCAMP program builds, facilitates and guides the processes, ensures issues
  are resolved, and tasks personnel and agencies across the PACAF staff, as required. Due to
  stringent AF/A7C and Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) timelines, differing
  approval requirements, and centralization of some programs, MILCON and MCAMP
  Corporate Structure processes and timelines differ from each other as well as from the rest of
  the HQ PACAF Corporate Structure; however, the intent of the corporate structure processes
  are met through the procedures that follow.
  A4.1.2. MILCON Program.
     A4.1.2.1. The PACAF staff builds the annual MILCON program to reflect PACAF
     needs and priorities to the Air Staff, Combatant Commander, OSD, and ultimately
     Congress. These needs are framed within PACAF’s Strategic Plan and published
     guidance developed at various levels of OSD, AF, and PACAF. HQ PACAF/A7N
     distributes MILCON guidance to all involved parties.
     A4.1.2.2. The primary source document for the MILCON program is the annual AF/A7C
     MILCON program guidance call. PACAF guidance is sent to the installations with
     submission deadlines appropriate to allow PACAF staff to build a proposed IPL and
     attain HQ PACAF/CC approval. The MILCON program is divided into New and Current
     Mission MILCON. New Mission MILCON projects are submitted to the appropriate
     CFL for inclusion into the annual New Mission MILCON list and are included in the
     PACAF Corporate Structure process for information only. Current Mission MILCON is
     prioritized utilizing the process below.
  A4.1.3. MILCON PWG. The MILCON PWG is comprised of functional representatives
  across the command staff that uses their familiarity and expertise to review, validate, score,
  and prioritize MILCON submissions. The MILCON PWG validates Wing inputs and
  determines adequacy and completeness of project documentation, and works with their Wing
  counterparts and/or other PACAF functional representatives to clarify/edit MILCON
  documentation as necessary. The MILCON PWG then scores each project based on latest
  AF standardized model, and uses this score as the baseline to develop the proposed MILCON
  IPL. MILCON PWG members will advocate for projects in their functional area, taking into
  account mission impact, PACAF Strategy, and other factors with the goal of developing the
  proposed MILCON IPL. MILCON PWG members continue to provide functional support to
  HQ PACAF/A7N throughout the entire MILCON approval process. HQ PACAF/A7NR
  chairs the MILCON PWG and will task personnel and agencies across the staff for input as
  necessary.
PACAFI16-501 20 JUNE 2014                                                                    23


  A4.1.4. MILCON PG. The MILCON PG provides division-level review of the proposed
  MILCON IPL developed by the MILCON PWG. The MILCON PG work with their
  MILCON PWG representatives and other PACAF Staff as necessary and makes adjustments
  to the proposed IPL as appropriate, and recommends forwarding the IPL for HQ PACAF
  approval. HQ PACAF/A7 chairs the MILCON PG and will task personnel and agencies
  across the staff for input as necessary.
  A4.1.5. PACAF MILCON IPL Approval.
     A4.1.5.1. Due to tight Headquarters Air Force (HAF) timeframes and MILCON cycles
     not matching normal POM deadlines, the MILCON PB and MILCON PC steps of the
     corporate structure process will be achieved by virtual means, unless requested
     differently by PACAF leadership. The MILCON PG approved MILCON IPL will be
     sent via electronic tasker for 2-letter coordination to the PACAF staff, before forwarding
     for HQ PACAF/CC approval.
     A4.1.5.2. Upon receiving HQ PACAF/CC approval, HQ PACAF/A7NR will transmit
     the PACAF IPL to AF/A7C functional representatives within prescribed timeframes.
  A4.1.6. Air Staff Corporate Process. Typically, HQ PACAF/A7NR and HQ PACAF/A8P
  are the PACAF representatives on the AF/A7C MILCON Working Group.             HQ
  PACAF/A7NR will be the spokesperson for PACAF MILCON projects; however, MILCON
  PWG members will work with HQ PACAF/A7NR to provide any clarification required by
  Air Staff as it goes through the AFCS.
  A4.1.7. The MCAMP Program. The PACAF/A7N staff builds the annual MCAMP to
  reflect PACAF’s real property construction, sustainment, restoration, and modernization
  programs. The Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM) program provides funds
  to keep the inventory of facilities in good working order. Respective priorities are submitted
  to AFCEC and AF/A7C. These programs are framed within PACAF’s Strategic Plan and
  published guidance developed at various levels of Air Staff, AFCEC, and PACAF. HQ
  PACAF/A7 distributes guidance to all involved parties. The primary source document for
  the MCAMP program is the annual AFCEC Comprehensive Management Plan (CAMP) IPL
  Investment Plan Strategy. PACAF CAMP IPL guidance is sent to the installations with
  submission deadlines appropriate to allow PACAF staff to build a proposed IPL and obtain
  PACAF/CV approval. The MCAMP IPL is prioritized and approved utilizing the process
  below:
     A4.1.7.1. MCAMP PWG.                The MCAMP PWG is comprised of functional
     representatives across the A7 staff who use their familiarity and expertise to review,
     validate, and prioritize the MCAMP IPL using the Wing’s Base Comprehensive Asset
     Management Plan (BCAMP) IPL submissions. The MCAMP PWG validates BCAMP
     IPLs and determines adequacy and completeness of project data and documentation, and
     works with their BCAMP counterparts and/or other PACAF/A7 functional
     representatives to clarify/edit BCAMP IPL data as necessary. The MCAMP PWG then
     scores each project based on latest AF standardized model, and uses this score as the
     baseline to develop the proposed MCAMP IPL. MCAMP PWG members will advocate
     for projects in their functional area, taking into account mission impact, PACAF Strategy,
     and other factors with the goal of developing the proposed MCAMP IPL. The MCAMP
     PWG is chaired by PACAF/A7NO.

       A4.1.7.2. PACAF MCAMP IPL Approval. Due to tight AFCEC timeframes and
       CAMP IPL cycles not matching normal POM deadlines, the steps of the corporate
       structure process will be achieved by virtual means, unless requested differently by
       PACAF leadership. The PACAF MCAMP IPL will be sent via electronic tasker for 2-
       letter coordination to the PACAF staff, before forwarding for CV for approval. Upon
       receiving PACAF/CV approval, PACAF/A7 will transmit the PACAF MCAMP IPL to
       AFCEC functional representatives within prescribed timeframes.
   A4.1.8. AFCEC Process. PACAF/A7 will be the PACAF representative on the HAF CE
   Council and PACAF/A7N will be the spokesperson for PACAF MCAMP IPL projects;
   however, MCAMP PG members will work with PACAF/A7 to provide any clarification
   required by AFCEC as it goes through the HAF CE Corporate Structure.
   A4.1.9. Housing. PACAF/A7I plans and programs Military Family Housing (MFH) and
   Unaccompanied Housing (UH).
       A4.1.9.1. The MFH MILCON is a centralized program managed by AF/A7COH and
       based on the AF Family Housing Master Plan (FHMP). Planning and programming for
       MFH improvements/replacements and construction start with updates of the Housing
       Requirements and Market Analysis (HRMA), then the Housing Community Profile
       (HCP) is developed to evaluate housing units based on AF standards. Results from the
       HCP analysis are incorporated into the PACAF FHMP, which is a 5-year look at the
       future MFH program.
       A4.1.9.2. The UH program is built based on future manning requirements determined by
       the HRMA or an integrated manpower projection by the A1. Community and dormitory
       conditions and analysis are analyzed and included in a Dormitory Master Plan (DMP)
       similar to the HCP.
       A4.1.9.3. Proposed PACAF FHMPs and DMPs are approved by the respective
       Installation Commanders and PACAF/A7 before final submittal to HQ PACAF/CC for
       approval. Air Staff will integrate all AF FHMPs and DMPs via corporate process, and
       will use them to prepare POM and Budget Estimate Submissions.
   A4.1.10. Releasability. At all stages of the AF and PACAF MILCON and MCAMP
   processes, project data is sensitive and internal working documents, and are not releasable to
   anyone outside of PACAF until after HQ PACAF/CC approval. Once approval is obtained,
   the MILCON and MCAMP programs are presented to the Air Staff; HQ PACAF/A7N will
   make distribution to the PACAF Staff.

PACAF CAPABILITY GAPS INTEGRATED PRIORITY LIST AND CORE FUNCTION
                       LEAD COORDINATION

A5.1. Identification and Prioritization of Capability Gaps.
   A5.1.1. The Director of Strategy, Plans and Programs (HQ PACAF/A5/8) is the corporate
   owner of the PACAF process for identification and prioritization of capabilities gaps.
   Accordingly, HQ PACAF/A5/8 tasks HQ PACAF A-Staff, Personal Staff, and NAFs to
   facilitate this process.
       A5.1.1.1. Plans to Resources to Outcomes Process (PROP). PROP is the US Pacific
       Command (USPACOM) process to perform capability-based mission analyses, assess
       capability sufficiency or shortfalls in achieving mission effects, and identify potential
       mitigation strategies for capability gaps. The resulting capability gaps and mitigations
       strategies form the foundation for influencing USPACOM programming priorities and
       recommendations.
       A5.1.1.2. PACAF Capability Gaps IPL Development Process. HQ PACAF/A8PE will
       develop an annual deliverable of PACAF prioritized capability gaps for HQ
       PACAF/A5/8. Identified capability gaps must be linked to requirements traceable to the
       PACAF Strategy Construct Lines of Operation (LOOs), USPACOM Theater Campaign
       Plan (TCP), Operations Plans (OPLANs)/Concept Plans (CONPLANs), Concepts of
       Operations (CONOPS), exercises and/or lessons learned. A cross-functional collection of
       capability gaps shall be consolidated into a central repository, with HQ PACAF/A8PE as
       the gatekeeper of PACAF capability gaps. The PACAF priority list should be delivered
       in time to inform the development of USPACOM’s PROP.
       A5.1.1.3. Submission of capability gaps must meet USPACOM guidance and follow a
       standardized format/template that is found in the annual Chairman’s Joint Assessment
       (CJA). The CJA contains several pieces of information common to drafting an
       informative capability gap: the gap statement, synopsis of the issue, risk assessment, list
       of on-going efforts and recommended way ahead to mitigate the issue. Each capability
       gap must have a designated division-level OPR assigned. The division OPR is
       responsible for developing and documenting the capability gap per standard
       USPACOM/PACAF format (maintained by HQ PACAF/A8PE, the process owner) and
       providing subject matter expertise.
       A5.1.1.4. If required, HQ PACAF/A8PE will convene the Capability Gaps PWG to
       assist in prioritization of PACAF capability gaps. Each Directorate/Division POC with
       support of SMEs will brief their respective Directorate/Division capability gaps to the
       Capability Gaps PWG. HQ PACAF/A8PE will provide instructions/guidance from
       senior leadership for the scoring/weighting of command priorities.
       A5.1.1.5. The ultimate goal of the Capability Gaps process is to provide USPACOM
       with a prioritized PACAF Capability Gaps Integrated Priority List (IPL) by the end of
       March each calendar year. HQ PACAF/A5/8 is the approval authority before submission
       to USPACOM.
