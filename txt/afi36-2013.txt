1.10.1. Submit a waiver request including the following documentation:

1.10.1.1. Copies of any relevant police reports.

1.10.1.2. Copies of any charging documents.

serving in an overseas area interested in applying for an Air Force commissioning program
requiring a Date Eligible for Return from Overseas (DEROS) curtailment must comply with all
provisions listed in AFI 36-2110. These procedures provide applicants a window of opportunity
to serve as much of their tour length as possible. Monitoring of this window is critical to the
success of the applicants submitting their commissioning application. AFRS will initiate
DEROS curtailment requests for BOT selectees as required.

1.12. Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) Classification/Reclassification. Once an individual has
been selected as a candidate for a commissioning program and classified into an AFSC, the
AFI36-2013 23 OCTOBER 2008                                                                      17

classification remains firm. The only considerations for a change in classification will be to meet
the needs of the Air Force, to rectify an administrative error, to address a specific individual
hardship, or if the individual fails to meet or becomes disqualified from meeting a physical
standard or security requirement. Submit request through HQ AFRS/RSOCL (BOT OTs) and
HQ AFROTC/RRUE (AFROTC cadets), who will in turn forward it to AFPC/DPSIP for action.

ENLISTED COMMISSIONING PROGRAMS

2.1. Purpose and Description.

2.1.1. This chapter describes eligibility, application, and processing procedures for Air Force-
approved enlisted commissioning programs. See Tables 2.4, through 2.7 for Organizational
Program Manager Responsibilities for all commissioning programs. Some of these programs
allow Airmen on active duty to request voluntary separation in accordance with AFI 36-3208,
Administrative Separation of Airmen, to enter an Air Force commissioning program. The latest
information on these commissioning programs can be obtained through your Force Support
Squadron (FSS) Education and Training Section or via one of these two websites:
http://www.afoats.af.mil/AFROTC/EnlistedComm/EnlistedCommissioning.asp or the HQ AFRS
page on the Air Force Portal website. All references to academic degrees in this chapter refer to
disciplines required by the Air Force.

2.2. Organizational Program Management Responsibilities. Programs for individuals to apply

health majors depending upon the program applied for. The pre-health program interfaces with
the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship (AFHPS), with follow-on medical school
scholarships. AFROTC pre-health students are guaranteed an AFHPS award provided they
obtain a pre-health designation and acceptance to an accredited medical school before their
commissioning date. For more information about the pre-health program, biomedical sciences
disciplines, and nursing boards, contact an AFROTC unit and submit an application through the
FSS Education and Training Section to HQ AFROTC/RRUE.

AFI36-2013 23 OCTOBER 2008                                                                      31

academic prerequisites, your degree plan must reflect they are not a requirement or provide other
evidence from the school.

2.5.3.3. Must be commissioned IAW age requirement listed in paragraph 1.3.1.2.3.

2.5.3.4. Must be accepted to a nationally accredited School of Nursing (National League for
Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC) or Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education
(CCNE)); student applicants must provide their letters of acceptance in their package.

AFROTC detachment. NECP students fall under the purview of the AFROTC detachment
commander while pursuing their degree.

2.5.3.5.1. The detachment is directly responsible for the accountability of the NECP students
assigned to their detachment.

2.5.3.5.2. The detachment will ensure NECP students are on track to graduate on their intended
date of graduation per guidelines in AFROTCI 36-2022, AFROTC Administration of the Airman
Education and Commissioning Program.

2.5.3.6. NECP students must meet the following academic standards:

2.5.3.6.1. Degree must be completed within 24 months. If member fails to complete program
requirements within 24 months, the detachment commander will investigate for disenrollment
and EAD decision. Final approval/disapproval authority is AFPC/DPAMN.

2.5.3.6.2. Students failing to meet minimum academic standards will be placed on probation by
the AFROTC detachment commander. Use AFROTC Form 16, Officer Candidate Counseling
Record, to document and counsel the student concerning minimum academic standards. This
action, referred to as a Conditional Event, constitutes a documented warning. Failure to improve
may result in dismissal from the NECP.

2.5.3.6.3. The detachment commander will award a Conditional Event and place the NECP
student on academic probation when term GPA falls below 2.5 on a 4.0 scale.

2.5.3.6.4. Detachment commanders will initiate a disenrollment investigation after an NECP
student receives his/her second Conditional Event for failure to maintain academic standards.
The focus of the investigation will be to determine whether there are any mitigating
circumstances for failing to meet academic standards. NOTE: because this is an active duty
education program, scholarship funds will not be suspended, regardless of the number of
Conditional Events awarded.

2.5.3.6.5. The detachment commander will provide HQ AFROTC/RRUE with a
recommendation concerning removal or retention of the NECP student via an AFROTC Form

a passing NCLEX score, students will be commissioned as Reserve officers until they enter
EAD, then the officer becomes Regular AF as a second lieutenant in the Nurse Corps (AFI 36-
2006). Oath of office can be administered by any commissioned officer the student so chooses
(local AFROTC detachment commander or an AFROTC assistant professor of aerospace
studies). AFROTC detachment commander will forward the AF Form 133, Oath of Office, to
AFPC/DPAMN for processing.

1.   Unit commanders are responsible for ensuring no more than one letter of recommendation
     for OTS is included in the application. This letter must be from an individual in the
     applicant’s chain of command, no higher than the organization’s senior rater, normally the
     wing commander or equivalent.

2.   The Air Force Chief of Staff, Air Staff Deputy Chiefs of Staff, other heads of staff agencies,
     directors, and comparable officers within the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, Office
     of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Office of the Secretary of Defense may act as the unit
     commander for their staff members.

3.   The commander personally reviews the applicant’s Unit Personnel Record Group (UPRG),
     or Automated Records Management System (ARMS), including military performance
     reports and UIF (if applicable), and confirms that the recommendation includes a copy of
     each performance report and any derogatory information (if applicable). Recommendations
     must include specific comments regarding the applicant’s potential as an officer, a statement
     that the applicant meets the requirements of Table 1.1 and a statement that the commander
     reviewed the applicant’s UPRG or ARMS and did or did not find derogatory information.
     The commander, along with FSS Education and Training Section personnel, counsels the
     applicant. The commander personally determines the applicant’s moral fitness for
     commission. If the applicant’s commander is less than a field grade officer, a field grade
     officer in the applicant’s chain of command must review and indorse the application. This
     form must be typed in paragraph or bullet format.

3.3.2. Refer to the HQ AFRS page on the Air Force Portal website for the HQ AFRS/RSOCL
board schedule and additional program guidance.

3.3.3. Applications can only meet sub-programs that are available on the particular board
submitted for; applications cannot cross between the Rated and Non-Rated subprograms.
Applicants can apply for a different type of board category (rated/non-rated) after 180 days from

AFRS to recruit and place junior (no more than 24 months from graduation) and senior college
students on active duty prior to college degree completion. This program also applies to
graduate students no more than 24 months from graduation. The intent and budget for the TDSP
program is to maintain 25 enlistees who are 24 months from graduation and 25 enlistees who are
12 months from graduation. Twenty-four-month graduates will graduate to the next class and
account for the 25 enlistees who are 12 months from graduation. Unfilled 24-month seats can be
targeted to 12-month graduates at a period in time determined by HQ AFRS.

appropriately accredited school. After basic eligibility is determined, the application package is
submitted to HQ AFRS for review and initiation of the selection process. Refer to Table 3.1,
AFI36-2013 23 OCTOBER 2008                                                                      69

BOT and TDSP Application Documents, for application requirements. HQ AFRS notifies
applicants of selection board results. AFPC classifies selectees based on academic background
and AF needs.

3.4.5.2. Phase II -- Enlistment Phase. Once individuals are notified and accept, they are enlisted
according to AFRSI 36-2001, Regular Air Force and Special Category Accessions, at the nearest
MEPS. During enlistment processing, the MEPS Liaison Noncommissioned Officer (LNCO)
again briefs the applicant on all details of TDSP and has the applicant execute the TDSP contract
agreement (Attachments 3, 4, and 5), which becomes an annex to the DD Form 4,
Enlistment/Reenlistment Document. Enlistees are placed on active duty as OTs with a special
duty identifier of 9T100, Officer Trainee, and assigned to HQ AFRS, with permanent duty
location at the enlistee’s school.

3.4.5.3. Phase III -- Academic Phase. During this phase, the TDSP participant is under the
administrative control of HQ AFRS. Degree requirements must be met within a specific time
period. Students failing to complete their approved degree programs within the period of time
prescribed by the TDSP contract may receive one academic term extension. The extended
academic term is limited to the next scheduled term after the last contract month of the program.
HQ AFRS is the extension approval authority for students who fail to graduate on time.
Evaluations are on a case-by-case basis and are approved only in instances where circumstances
clearly indicate the best interests of the Air Force will be served. An extension will not be
granted where student neglect is the cause. Extensions are not routine and usually are approved
only when a student can make up the course in a summer session. Students who fail a core
course, sequential course, or courses offered once a year, or where summer sessions are not
available, usually will not receive a waiver. They will be called to extended active duty in their
enlisted grade. The TDSP enlistee must ensure a current official transcript will be provided to
HQ AFRS/RSO at the end of each academic term.

3.4.5.4. Phase IV -- Military Phase. During this phase, individuals who have completed the
academic phase and received their degree are assigned to OTS for pre-commissioning training.
HQ AFRS is responsible for processing individuals into OTS.

3.4.5.4.1. TDSP participants completing degree requirements are assigned PCS to their new duty
station with TDY en route as OTs at OTS. Selectees will be sent to the first available OTS class
after graduation. Selectees’ records and orders should be sent to arrive at Maxwell AFB AL,
NLT 10 calendar days before class reporting date.

3.4.5.4.2. AFPC and the local MPE are responsible for publishing orders for Airmen completing
degree requirements and reassigning the Airmen PCS to their new duty station with TDY en
route as OTs at OTS.

3.4.6.2. HQ AFRS is delegated the responsibility and authority to promptly dismiss Airmen who
fail to maintain acceptable retention standards, including satisfactory academic progress and
commission potential.

3.4.6.3. Failure to complete the academic phase within the specified period of time for which
selected is justification for removal from school on a case-by-case basis.

3.4.6.4. HQ AFRS is responsible for immediate notification to AFPC/DPSOA when a TDSP
student is disenrolled from the academic phase.

3.4.6.5. HQ AFRS is responsible for processing eliminees to their next assignment as
expeditiously as possible.

3.4.6.6. Baccalaureate Degree-Seeking Eliminees. If the TDSP applicant fails to complete the
program in either the academic or military phase, he/she must continue to serve 2 years on active
duty in an enlisted status that commences with their reporting date to basic military training
(BMT).

3.4.6.6.1. For prior service individuals who will not require BMT attendance, 2 years
commences with their date arrived station (DAS) at their first duty assignment after TDSP
disenrollment. Individual assignment desires will be considered, however, Air Force
requirements will take precedence. AFPC Classifications will ensure participant is properly
classified during BMT.

3.4.6.6.2. HQ AFRS/RSO and AFPC will ensure participants are properly classified to fill Air
Force needs.

3.4.6.6.3. HQ AFRS, in conjunction with AFPC/DPSOA, is responsible for processing academic
eliminees per paragraph 3.4.6.6. as expeditiously as possible. AFPC and OTS are responsible for
processing OTS eliminees per paragraph 3.4.6.6. as expeditiously as possible.

NOTES:

1. Overseas civilian applicants may enlist through the MPE in the same manner as non-prior
service applicants. Refer to AFI 36-2002 for procedures.

2. Inform all applicants that voluntary changes from a flying to a non-flying utilization field and
medical disqualification from flying training after commissioning do not, by themselves, result in
discharge.

3. An applicant selected by HQ AFRS to attend OTS who is a member of the AFRES/AFRC or
ANG, or in the OTS DEP is ineligible for the program if he or she refuses to accept voluntary
EAD.

4. During relocation processing, MPE Career Development Element interviews the applicant to
determine if he or she is still eligible and desires officer training. They notify HQ AFRS and the
MAJCOM if the applicant is no longer eligible or doesn't want to attend the program.

5. AFPC/DPSIP furnishes the MPE end assignment instructions for the applicant's projected
officer AFSC not later than 30 days before class start date begins outside MilPDS. They do not
enter the assignment into MilPDS since strength accountability remains with the losing MPE
until the Airman accepts a commission. At that time, 22 TRSS/MSPC affects separation from
enlisted status through MilPDS. If the Airman fails to complete the program, AFPC provides 22
TRSS/MSPC with assignment instructions.

6. If an Airman is in an SRB skill and is administratively accepted or selected for OTS or
reenlists or extends enlistment after the date of acceptance or selection, the Airman is not entitled
to the SRB. DFAS suspends installments for Airmen who have received partial SRB payments
and for Airmen who reenlist after submitting application for training leading to a commission
(AFI 36-2606, Chapter 3). The fact that an Airman has not received official orders to attend a
course of instruction leading to a commission (at time of reenlistment or entry into an extension),
does not establish SRB payment entitlement as the reason for reenlistment or extension is not to
serve in an SRB AFSC. OTs may not receive proficiency pay (see AFI 36-3017, Special Duty
Assignment Pay (SDAP) Program).

7. AFPC/DPSIP changes an OT's AFS if the trainee's academic background is better suited to
another specialty or to meet changing Air Force needs.

                                         promotion occurs before the OTS class start date.

NOTES:

1. Note in the remarks section of the PCS orders that the Airman will be promoted to the grade
of SSgt effective l day before scheduled departure date to ensure entitlements to transportation of
dependents and household goods at government expense. Do not authorize Airmen promoted
under this criterion more than a 10 calendar day delay en route. If the selectee does not attend
the scheduled OTS class, the MPE administratively demotes the Airman to the grade previously
held. While being selected to attend OTS is cause for celebrating, do not hold a ceremony for
the provisional promotion to SSgt. If promotion cannot be updated at MPE, Career Development
Element contacts AFPC/DPSOE for assistance.

2. Since the Airman will serve in the grade of SSgt while attending OTS, no action is taken to
effect promotion at the time that the sequence number would be affected.

3.6. Supplying Uniforms to OTS Selectees.

3.6.1. Civilians receive money for initial issue of uniforms from the clothing monetary allowance
system.

3.6.2. Active duty Airmen TDY en route to OTS receive their usual clothing maintenance
allowance (see DFAS DEM 177-373, Defense Joint Military Payment System Active Component
[JMS-AC] FSO Procedures).
76                                                         AFI36-2013 23 OCTOBER 2008

3.6.3. Guidance regarding clothing allowances for Reservists can be found in the DoD Financial
Management Regulation (FMR), Volume 7A, Chapter 29.

3.6.3.1. AFRC units conduct clothing inspections for their members selected for OTS.

3.6.3.2. The host or base equipment management office replaces uniform items meeting the
criteria in AFMAN 67-1, Basic Air Force Supply Procedures, Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 17.

3.7. Granting Leave to Officer Trainees (OTs). OTs may go on leave in accordance with AFI 36-
3003, Military Leave Program. The 22 TRSS/MSPC serves as the leave processing activity for
OTs.

3.8. Administration of OT Personnel Actions.

3.8.1. The 22 TRSS/MSPC serves as the MPE for all OTs. It uses a modified MilPDS to access
and process data, classify and assign OTs, and perform other actions necessary to maintain their
military personnel files.

3.8.2. The 24 TRS/CC manages and controls all BOT functions including administrative
procedures for the elimination and recycling of students. The 23 TRS/CC manages and controls
all COT functions including administrative procedures for the elimination and recycling of
students.

3.9. Elimination of OTs.

3.9.1. The OTS/CC is the disenrollment decision authority for all trainees. The 24 TRS/CC is
the recycle decision authority. The OTS/CC may delegate disenrollment authority for
administrative disenrollments only (self-initiated elimination, medical, extended absence, initial
eligibility) to the 24 TRS/CC.

3.9.2. Consider eliminating an OT from training for any of the following reasons:

3.9.2.1. Military Training Deficiency (MTD). OT fails to achieve passing scores on written and
performance measurements. Three failures usually signal a MTD, but any number of failures
may form a basis for elimination, depending on the severity of the deficiencies and on
surrounding circumstances.

3.9.2.2. Lack of Adaptability. OT demonstrates inability to adapt to or display the necessary
physical, psychological, or personality traits of an Air Force officer, or an OT lacks the personal
capacity and inclination, whether natural or acquired, to adapt to military relationships, customs,
and responsibilities that have become traditional and necessary in military service. Also
includes, but is not limited to, any misconduct which would constitute a basis for discharge
under AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures for Commissioned Officers, or AFI
36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen.
AFI36-2013 23 OCTOBER 2008                                                                       77

3.9.2.3. Self-Initiated Elimination (SIE). Withdrawal from the course results from a student's
written request for elimination.

3.9.2.4. Medical Disqualification. Results from a medical defect or condition that renders the
student incapable of maintaining the physical standards required to complete the program. The
24 TRS/CC initiates elimination due to medical disqualification after proper medical authority
certifies the OT as “disqualified.” The 24 TRS/CC ensures the medical disqualification
information is noted in the remarks section of the DD Form 785 Record of Disenrollment from
Officer Candidate-Type Training. The DD Form 785 will indicate whether an OT is
permanently or temporarily medically disqualified.

3.9.2.4.1. OTs who are deemed permanently medically disqualified (per conditions listed in AFI
48-123) will have their records reviewed by HQ AETC/SGPS who will confirm the disqualifying
factor. The review date will be annotated in the remarks section of the DD Form 785.

3.9.2.4.2. OTs who qualified medical personnel believe can recover from their medical condition
within 180 days and complete the physical training requirements of OTS will be given a 180-day
reinstatement option which will be outlined in the remarks section of the DD Form 785.

3.9.2.5. Extended absence from training for personal reasons (usually more than 3 days) for any
reason.

3.9.2.6. A determination that the OT was initially ineligible for OTS to include OTs who do not
meet initial Body Mass Index or Body Fat requirements.

3.9.2.7. Prejudicial Conduct, any conduct inconsistent with the OTS honor code, or
demonstration of undesirable character traits. OTS will give strong consideration to initiating
administrative discharge action under AFI 36-3208 for any OT eliminated under this paragraph.

3.9.3. OTS processes OT elimination in accordance with internal procedures and AETC, Holm
Center, and OTS instructions. OTS is responsible for completing a DD Form 785 to document
each elimination from training case.

3.9.4. 22 TRSS/MSPC will notify AFPC/DPSIP immediately of any active duty quota OTs
actually removed from training who are within 5 days of graduating.

3.10. Disposition of Disenrolled OTs.

3.10.1. 22 TRSS/MSPC processes disenrolled OTs in accordance with the guidelines listed in
Table 3.4.
78                                                        AFI36-2013 23 OCTOBER 2008

R
U
L
E     Disenrolled Officer Trainee Procedures
1     If the OT being eliminated entered OTS as a nonprior or prior service applicant and
      specifically enlisted to attend OTS, OTS will process a discharge under AFI 36-3208,
      paragraph 5.22. (entry level performance or conduct), paragraph 3.10. (voluntary
      discharge after elimination from OTS), or another appropriate paragraph.
2     If the OT being eliminated entered OTS as an active duty applicant (including those who
      entered through AECP) and is being eliminated for failure to meet military retention
      standards, consider processing the OT for discharge under AFI 36-3208. If discharge is
      not warranted by the circumstances, OTS processes the OT for reassignment.
3     If the OT being eliminated entered as an active duty applicant (including those who
      entered through AECP), and is not being eliminated for failure to meet military retention
      standards, OTS processes the OT for reassignment.
4     If the OT being eliminated is a non-prior service applicant, OTS will demote the applicant
      to A1C (see AFI 36-2002 and AFI 36-2503).
5     If the OT being eliminated is an AFRC applicant, HQ AFRC/A1BB instructs
      22 TRSS/MSPC whether to process a discharge or a reassignment.
6     If the OT being eliminated is a prior service applicant, OTS will demote the applicant to
      the rank held immediately before entering OTS (if below SSgt).
7     OTS files the DD Form 785 in the UPRG or ARMS for all OTS elimination cases.
8     If the OT is a non-prior or prior service applicant (i.e. not AD USAF applicant) and elects,
      in writing, to enlist in the Regular Air Force, 24 TRS/CCA transfers the student to the 22
      TRSS/MSPC.
      - 22 TRSS/MSPC sends the request to AFPC/DPSOA, 550 C Street West, Suite 10,
           Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4712 for approval or disapproval.
      - If AFPC/DPSOA approves enlistment, the trainee may not request separation at a later
           date under this AFI.
9     When reassigning eliminated OTs, OTS:
      - counts the time the member spent as an OT in computing the member’s remaining
           service obligation.
      - when required, adjusts the member’s grade to that authorized under the non-prior or
           prior service enlistment program (see AFI 36-2002), as applicable, at the time of his or
           her current enlistment.
      - demotes an individual who was an active duty Airman in accordance with AFI 36-
           2503.
      - promotes an Airman entitled to promotion because of previous selection (see Table
           3.3) in accordance with AFI 36-2502.
10    22 TRSS/MSPC requests assignment instructions for eliminated active duty Airmen from
      the appropriate AFPC assignment OPR (see AFI 36-2110) and sends an information copy
      of the request to:
      - AFPC/DPSIP, the losing MAJCOM, and MPE. (see Attachment 8)
AFI36-2013 23 OCTOBER 2008                                                                     79


       - AFPC/DPSIP and AFROTC/RRUE if the disenrolled OT was an AECP participant.
11     AFPC/DPSIP or the assignment OPR sends assignment instructions to the servicing MPE.
12     The OT’s servicing MPE publishes the required assignment or separation orders and sends
       them to 22 TRSS/MSPC for presentation to the OT.
13     The OT remains attached to 24 TRSS/CCA pending receipt of assignment or separation
       orders.

3.11. Placing OTs on Hold.

3.11.1. No later than 3 duty days before graduation, 22 TRSS/MSPC notifies AFPC/DPSIP of
OTs whose status requires that they be held over, specifically, OTs who are:

3.11.1.1. Awaiting medical qualification.

3.11.1.2. Awaiting action that rendered them ineligible for graduation.

3.11.1.3. Awaiting receipt of official transcripts.

3.11.1.4. Awaiting completion of a NAC (unless the OT has prior enlisted service without a
break in service greater than 24 months).

3.11.2. 22 TRSS/MSPC may notify appropriate agencies by telephone or e-mail by close of the
duty day the withholding action occurred.

3.11.3. OTs not cleared for commissioning by their graduation date and held over to a later class
may be commissioned as soon as all required actions are complete. They need not wait until the
commissioning date for the next BOT class.

3.11.4. 22 TRSS/MSPC notifies HQ AFRC/A1BB when holding over OTs who are filling AFRC
quotas.

3.12. Graduation and Commissioning.

3.12.1. An OT who was a cadet at any service academy (including the Coast Guard and
Merchant Marine academies) may not receive a commission before the commissioning date of
his or her former academy classmates. EXCEPTION: AFPC/CC may grant a waiver.

3.12.2. 24 TRS/CC ensures Flight Commanders (Flt/CCs) will conduct a thorough pre-
commissioning review of any OT whose mental, moral, physical, and professional fitness are
questionable. Upon conclusion of the pre-commissioning review the Flt/CC will recommend
appointment or other action.

3.12.3. When the Flt/CC and the reviewing authorities do not recommend an OT for
commissioning, 24 TRS/CC determines if elimination action is appropriate.

3.12.4. When a qualified OT does not accept an appointment, 22 TRSS/MSPC:
80                                                         AFI36-2013 23 OCTOBER 2008



3.12.4.1. Processes the OT as an eliminated student.

3.12.4.2. Terminates the appointment offer.

3.12.4.3. Takes action to have the OT reassigned, if required.

3.12.5. If it is discovered that a civilian or UCMJ criminal action or investigation is pending
against an OT, 24 TRS/CC suspends commissioning actions until the case is resolved.
EXCEPTION: Minor traffic violations do not require a commissioning suspension. If 24
TRS/CC determines, in consultation with Holm Center/JA, that resolution of the criminal case
will be delayed for an unusual length of time, OTS consults AFPC/DPSIP for guidance. If the
OT is the subject of any adverse adjudication while in OTS (such as a deferred judgment or
pretrial diversion), 24 TRS/CC consults with Holm Center/JA to consider appropriate waiver
action in accordance with AFI 36-2002.

3.12.6. When an OT who entered OTS to fill an active duty quota accepts an appointment, 22
TRSS/MSPC orders the officer to EAD for 4 years.

3.12.7. Officers who later complete UFT incur additional ADSCs in accordance with AFI 36-
2107, Active Duty Service Commitments.

under orders published by the AFRC unit.

3.12.9. 22 TRSS/MSPC terminates a newly commissioned officer's enlisted status by discharging
the OT in accordance with AFI 36-3208. Upon discharge, deliver the DD Form 214 to the new
OT on the discharge date.

3.12.10. 22 TRSS/MSPC initiates appropriate military record groups in accordance with AFI 36-
2608, Military Personnel Records Systems, and updates the Foreign Language Self Assessment
in MilPDS prior to class graduation.

3.12.12.3. Undergraduate Helicopter Pilot Training.

3.12.12.4. Undergraduate Combat Systems Operator Training.

3.12.13. For AFRC graduates, 22 TRSS/MSPC:

3.12.13.1. Requests HQ ARPC/DPAAA provide appointment and assignment orders for each
new Reserve officer.

3.12.13.2. Publishes orders announcing AFRC distinguished graduates and provides HQ
AFRC/A1BB and the units of assignment with information copies.

3.12.14. Distinguished Graduates (DGs) are the outstanding and honor graduates of each OTS
class. 22 TRSS/MSPC will annotate the personnel records of DGs as appropriate.

NOTES:

1. Graduates attending technical training at Maxwell AFB may not take a delay en route between
graduation from OTS and their reporting date to the course of instruction. The gaining unit must
initiate normal leave procedures to ensure leave accountability.

2. Even if the member does not desire leave at the time of graduation, include authority for delay
en route in the assignment orders. This ensures coverage of any situation that might arise after
publication of assignment orders and graduation that may require leave status for the member.

3.14. When to Make Posthumous Reserve Appointments. Refer to AFI 36-2005, paragraph 2.11.

3.15. Reinstating Officer Trainees.

3.15.1. An OT eliminated due to medical disqualification, initial ineligibility, or extended

3.15.2. The disenrolled OT must send a written request for reinstatement to OTS/CD, 501
LeMay Plaza North, Maxwell AFB, AL 36112-5000 with a physician’s statement or other
supporting documents confirming the correction of the disqualifying factor, within 6 months of
disenrollment for medical disqualification or within 3 months of disenrollment for initial
ineligibility or extended absence from OTS (OTS does not require formal reapplication).

3.15.3. If elimination was due to medical disqualification, 22 TRSS/MSPC or 24 TRS/DO will
forward reinstatement recommendations to HQ AFRS/RSOCL, 550 D Street West, Suite 1,
Randolph AFB, TX 78150. Include with the request a copy of the disenrollment documentation
and medical documentation such as current AF Form 422, physician’s statement, or other

3.17.1.4. Individuals who have attended a previous indoctrination course as a commissioned
officer (Air Force Officer Orientation Course, Health Professions Officer Indoctrination Course,
or Military Indoctrination for Medical Service Officers) and subsequently served 1 year on EAD
as a commissioned officer, or who have satisfactorily participated for 1 year in the Air National
Guard or Air Force Reserve as a commissioned officer.

3.17.2. Functional communities may waive any of the attendance exemptions and allow, or
require, course attendance if the functional determines it is in the best interest of the Air Force
for the officer to attend COT.

3.18. COT Timeline for Attendance. Attendance at COT/RCOT should be as soon as possible,
but no later than 12 months after commissioning, unless the member is granted a waiver. All
direct-commissioned ANG and ARC non-line and JAG officers are also required to be scheduled
for COT within 12 months of initial appointment.

3.18.1. Requests for waiver of attendance timeline will be forwarded through the respective
functional managers for review and recommendation to appropriate authority for
approval/disapproval.

3.18.1.1. For active duty personnel, HQ AF/A1DO has final authority to approve/disapprove
attendance waivers.

3.18.1.2. For ANG personnel, NGB/A1 has final approval/disapproval authority.

3.18.1.4. Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) students will attend IAW the
statement of understanding in their contract.

3.18.2. Reserve and Guard members who attend the RCOT course are required to successfully
complete the distance learning module and tests NLT 40 days prior to attending the RCOT
course. If extenuating circumstances preclude an officer from completing the distance learning
module and tests NLT 40 days prior to attending RCOT, the functional manager must coordinate
these on a case-by-case basis with Holm Center/CR through 23 TRS/CC. If the officer has not
completed all advanced course work within 15 days prior to class start date, students will be
removed from the course roster.

3.18.3. Students must be loaded into MilPDS/OTA 30 days prior to class start date in accordance
with paragraph 3.21. Exceptions will be handled on a case-by-case basis with 23 TRS/CC or 23
TRS/DO.

3.18.4. Requests for exceptions to policy will be forwarded to HQ AF/A1DO, AF/REP, or
NGB/A1, as appropriate, for review and approval.

3.18.5. Nonnative English-Speaking (NES) Evaluation and Processing Actions. NES students
must successfully pass an English comprehension level assessment IAW paragraph 1.5. and
AFI36-2013 23 OCTOBER 2008                                                                        87

Table 1.3., at their military entrance processing point prior to attending COT or RCOT.

3.19. COT Entry/Exit Standards. All officers attending COT/RCOT are direct-commissioned
officers and must comply with applicable AF entry standards.

3.19.1. Entry Standards.

3.19.1.1. Functional communities will advise prospective COT students on weight and body fat
standards, fitness standards, and the physical demands of COT within 120 days of class start
date. Students will not be disenrolled based on weight and body fat measurements, but remedial
action will be taken.

3.19.2. Physical Demands. COT requires marching, running, lifting, climbing, calisthenics, and
enduring 3 days of field conditions.

3.19.2.1. COT/RCOT trainees must meet all AF physical fitness standards IAW AFI 10-248,
Fitness Program. All COT/RCOT trainees will take a physical fitness assessment (1.5 mile run,
push-ups, sit-ups, and waist measurement) while at OTS.

3.19.2.2. Officers who cannot participate in these physical activities will not attend COT/RCOT
without prior approval from 23 TRS/CC. If an officer is injured during training, medical
personnel will determine physical limitations and the 23 TRS/CC will determine if the student
can complete the program.

3.19.3. Pregnant officers will not attend COT/RCOT.

3.19.3.1. If pregnancy is determined while at COT, medical personnel will determine an
appropriate physical profile. The 23 TRS/CC will determine if the officer can complete the
program within the constraints of the physical limitations.

3.19.4 Elimination of COT Attendees.

3.19.4.1. Academic or Performance Failures. If an officer cannot meet the COT/RCOT training
objectives after remediation, 23 TRS/CC may recycle student to a later class, after coordination
with the functional manager.

3.19.4.2. If the officer is not recycled, the AF Form 475, Education/Training Report, will reflect
course non-completion.

3.19.4.2.1. If the officer misses significant aspects of the course (23 TRS/CC evaluates each
situation on a case-by-case basis), 23 TRS/CC, after coordination with the functional manager,
will determine to recycle the officer to a later class or disenroll him/her from the course. The 23
TRS/CC will advise the gaining commander/program manager via a letter of assessment. The
officer’s training report will be annotated accordingly.

3.19.4.3. The OTS/CC is the disenrollment authority for all officers, if there is cause, in his/her
88                                                            AFI36-2013 23 OCTOBER 2008

judgment, to do so.

3.19.4.3.1. Causes for disenrollment may include, but are not limited to: inability to obtain
medical clearance to engage in physical activities, absenteeism without prejudice (missing class
through no fault or beyond the control of the officer), lack of adaptability, etc.

3.19.4.3.2. OTS/CC will coordinate with the functional manager during disenrollment
proceedings.

3.19.4.3.2.1. When appropriate, 23 TRS/CC will remediate minimal uniform and military
standards for officers, who for non-punitive reasons, cannot complete the course. Functional
managers will send such officers to the next available COT class.

3.19.5. Discharge of COT Attendees. AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures for
Commissioned Officers, provides the guidelines for the involuntary discharge for officers on
EAD orders.

3.19.5.1. 23 TRS/CC will notify the functional POC if it becomes necessary to discharge an
