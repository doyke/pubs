                                           Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. This Air Force Instruction (AFI) provides policy for operating the C-17A aircraft. It is
   an original source document for many areas but, for efficacy, restates information found in
   aircraft flight manuals, flight information publications (FLIP), and other Air Force directives.
   When guidance in this AFI conflicts with another basic/source document, that document
   takes precedence. For matters where this AFI is the source document, waiver authority is in
   accordance with (IAW) paragraph 1.4. For matters where this AFI repeats information in
   another document, follow waiver authority outlined in the basic/source document.
   1.1.2. Unit commanders and agency directors involved with or supporting C-17A operations
   shall make current copies of this AFI available to appropriate personnel. Transportation and
   Base Operations passenger manifesting agencies will maintain a current copy of this AFI.
1.2. Applicability. This AFI applies to aircrew members, support personnel, and managers
involved with employing C-17A aircraft.
1.3. Key Words Explained.
   1.3.1. "Will" and "shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. "Should" indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment.
   1.3.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. "NOTE" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
   emphasize.
   1.3.5. ―CAUTION‖ indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in
   damage to equipment if not carefully followed.
   1.3.6. ―WARNING‖ indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in
   personal injury or loss of life if not carefully followed.
1.4. Deviations and Waivers. Do not deviate from policies in this AFI except when the
situation demands immediate action to ensure safety. The Pilot in Command (PIC) is vested
with ultimate mission authority and responsible for each course-of-action they choose to take.
   1.4.1. Deviations. The PIC shall report deviations or exceptions taken without a waiver
   through command channels to their Chief, Major Command (MAJCOM) Stan/Eval, who in
   turn shall notify Chief, AMC Stan/Eval (lead command) as appropriate for follow-on action.
   1.4.2. Waivers. Unless otherwise directed, waiver authority for the contents of this
   instruction is the MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority.                For
   TRANSCOM/AMC operational missions under Operational Control (OPCON) of 18 Air
   Force, 18 AF/CC is the waiver authority. For aircrews that change Operational Control
   (CHOP) to a COCOM, the COMAFFOR is the waiver authority.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                 17


       1.4.2.1. Permanent waivers affect theater unique circumstances and are enduring in
       nature.    List MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved permanent waivers in the MAJCOM
       supplement (see para. 1.5.)
       1.4.2.2. Long-term waivers affect multiple aircraft/multiple missions but are not
       permanent in nature (expire at a specific date/time). MAJCOM Stan/Eval shall send HQ
       AMC Stan/Eval (lead command) copies of MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved long-term
       waivers.
       1.4.2.3. Short-notice waivers are for specific missions in execution. PICs shall use the
       Waiver Protocol procedure in Chapter 4 to secure MAJCOM/A3/DO approval for short-
       notice waivers.
1.5. Supplemental Procedures. This AFI is a basic directive. Each user MAJCOM or
operational theater may supplement this AFI according to AFPD 11-2, Aircraft Rules and
Procedures, and AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. Stipulate unique MAJCOM
procedures (shall not be less restrictive than this basic document) and publish
MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved permanent waivers in the MAJCOM supplement.
   1.5.1. Combined Command Operations. Plan and conduct all operations that include forces
   from multiple MAJCOMs using provisions in this AFI. Do not assume or expect aircrews to
   perform MAJCOM theater unique procedures without owning MAJCOM/A3/DO approval
   and advance training.
   1.5.2. Coordination Process. Forward MAJCOM approved supplements (attach AF Form
   673, Request To Issue Publication) to HQ AMC/A3V, 402 Scott Dr., Unit 3A1, Scott AFB
   IL, 62225-5302.

                                            Chapter 2

                                COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The Mobility Air Forces (MAF) command and control (C2) network consists of
the following C2 centers: 618 Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) Tanker Airlift Control
Center (TACC) (618 AOC (TACC)), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) or United States Air Forces
Europe (USAFE) Air and Space Operations Centers (AOCs), Air National Guard (ANG)
Command Center, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Command Center, theater Air and
Space Operations Centers (AOC), Air Mobility Division (AMD), Joint Operational Support
Airlift Center (JOSAC), Special Air Missions Division, Office of Assistant Vice Chief of Staff,
USAF (CVAM), Unit Command Posts, Air Mobility Control Centers (AMCC), Contingency
Response Groups (CRG), Contingency Response Elements (CRE), and Special Tactics Teams
(STT). C2 centers are action agents for the MAF commander with execution authority
(operational control) over mobility missions/forces.
2.2. Execution Authority. Headquarters commanders with command authority over MAF
resources hold execution authority for directed missions. Commanders with execution authority
formulate plans, allocate assets, and approve missions through a local command post or C2
element. OG/CCs serve as execution authority for local training missions. The pilot in
command will execute missions operating outside normal communication channels (use last
known mission orders or best course of action).
   2.2.1. Off-Station Trainer (OST).      Refer to MAJCOM instruction, for procedures and
   requirements.
       2.2.1.1. AFRC Current Operations (AFRC/A3OO) is approval authority for AFRC
       OSTs.
2.3. Pilot in Command (PIC) Responsibility and Authority. SQ/CCs shall designate an
aircraft commander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), or evaluator pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights,
on a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable
supplements. PICs are:
   2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft and are the final responsibility and
   authority for the safe operation and conduct of the flight, regardless of who is at the controls.
   2.3.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only fly
   events authorized in the mission tasking unless, in the PIC‘s judgment, an emergency
   condition demands otherwise. Fly unscheduled training events (for example, air refueling
   (AAR) or transition training) after obtaining approval of the execution authority.
   2.3.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority.
   2.3.4. The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
   2.3.5. Responsible for passing mission progress reports (at least daily) to C2 agents.
   2.3.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel
   and will establish a point-of-contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior to entering
   crew rest. Local C2 agents are responsible for coordinating mission support requirements on
   the PIC‘s behalf.
 20                                 AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   2.3.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Personnel (MEP),
   passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The execution authority and PIC shall make the mission
clearance decision. In all cases, final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with
the PIC. If a PIC elects to delay a mission, that mission will not depart until the conditions that
generated the decision to delay improve or are resolved. Further, no execution authority may
task another PIC to take the same mission under the same conditions.
   2.4.1. Only re-route or divert a mission when authorized by the execution authority, to
   resolve an emergency, or if required due to insufficient fuel or en route or terminal weather
   conditions.
   2.4.2. The agent that directed the re-route or divert shall ensure the aircraft is capable of
   executing departure, en route, and destination arrival procedures.
   2.4.3. The PIC will notify the appropriate C2 agent of any aircraft or aircrew limitation that
   may preclude re-route or divert.
   2.4.4. When a C2 agent directs a PIC to fly to an alternate airfield, the agent will ensure
   existing and forecast weather for the alternate, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), and airfield
   information from the Global Decision Support System (GDSS)/GDSS2/Airfield Suitability
   and Restrictions Report (ASRR), is suitable. If the alternate becomes unsuitable while en
   route, coordinate with the C2 agent for other suitable alternates. The PIC is final authority
   for accepting a suitable alternate. A C2 agent will alert customs and all appropriate ground
   service agencies to prepare for arrival.
2.5. Operational C2 Reporting.
   2.5.1. Stations With MAF C2 Agency. Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data
   (arrival, departure, and advisory messages) in the MAF C2 system.
   2.5.2. Stations Without MAF C2 Agency. Transmit mission data (arrival, departure, and
   advisory messages) to the controlling C2 agency by any means available (preference in the
   following order: DSN/commercial line, Airline Operational Control (AOC), HF/ALE,
   Iridium Phone, AERO-I). For critical C2 communications, i.e. aircraft waiver request,
   maintenance delay, etc., voice communications are the primary method.
   2.5.3. C2 Communications.
       2.5.3.1. Airline Operational Control (AOC). Do not send messages solely for crew
       training unless a transmission time has been pre-coordinated with TACC/XONI.
           2.5.3.1.1. IFM Missions. Airline Operational Control (AOC) will be the primary
           means of routine communications between FM/C2 and aircrew. AOC is not a secure
           means of communication. Do not pass classified information via AOC. For critical
           C2 communications, voice communications are the primary method.
           2.5.3.1.2. NON-IFM MISSIONS. Initialize Airline Operational Control, but do not
           send messages unless other channels of communication are not available. Initializing
           allows TACC to take advantage of automated position reporting, free text capability
           and automated OOOI (OUT OF BLOCKS, OFF GROUND, ON GROUND, and IN
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  21


         BLOCKS) reporting. Non-IFM missions must realize that messages will be handled
         on a first come, first serve basis as resources permit.
     2.5.3.2. ALE. The ALE system is provided as an alternate means of communication
     between the aircraft and a number of C2 agencies. When an HF radio, in SELCAL
     mode, is required for primary ATC, use AERO-I and/or AOC to monitor C2, in lieu of
     ALE. Ensure the other HF radio is not in ALE to preclude overriding ATC messages.
     (N/A when using CPDLC).
     2.5.3.3. Combat Track II (CT II). CT II provides a secure means of communication
     between the aircraft and a number of C2 agencies.
     2.5.3.4. The AERO-I satellite voice system is provided as an alternative means of
     communication between the aircraft and a number of C2 agencies and ATC. The system
     will be used only for non-secure in-flight communications between aircrews and C2
     organizations and between aircrews and oceanic air traffic controllers. Due to the high
     cost of using the system, aircrews should attempt communications by other means (HF,
     UHF, ALE, etc.) for C2 communications before using the AERO-I system. AERO-I
     voice is a backup for the Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC), Airline
     Operational Control (AOC) and C2 communications. Certain C2 and ATC agencies have
     the capability to call the aircraft using the AERO-I. AERO-I is for official use only.
         2.5.3.4.1. The AERO-I communications software loaded on the aircraft automatically
         logs onto a specific Ground Earth Station (GES), based on aircraft location, and
         which GES is under contract to provide service. Manually selecting a different GES
         will result in a connection through a non-contract carrier, resulting in a much higher
         cost. Aircrews will only manually select a different GES when all other avenues of
         communication have failed, and when essential for mission completion.
     2.5.3.5. DV Messages. Airborne unclassified messages originated by DV passengers
     may be transmitted at the discretion of the PIC.
     2.5.3.6. Iridium Phone. Iridium phones may be used for communications between
     aircrews and command and control agencies when beyond-line of sight C2 is required
     and other line of sight communications, HF or SAT-2000 do not provide proper security
     or timeliness. For more information, refer to AMC Iridium Satellite Phone CONOPS for
     Aircrews       under     the   CONOPS         section   of    the     A3O    website:
     https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a33/A33O/.
         2.5.3.6.1. Turn off Iridium phones within 25 feet of ground refueling operations.
         2.5.3.6.2. Turn off Iridium phones during takeoff, air refueling, approach, and
         landing.
  2.5.4. Enroute Reporting.
     2.5.4.1. Make the following enroute reports to the appropriate MAF C2 agency:
         2.5.4.1.1. Airborne report when departing from a location without an AMC presence.
         2.5.4.1.2. Maintenance report whenever aircraft alpha status changes to code 3.
         2.5.4.1.3. On aeromedical evacuation missions, no later than 1 hour prior to landing,
         to update arrival time.
22                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


         2.5.4.1.4. Uncoordinated aircraft intercepts via the most expeditious means available,
         after complying with guidance in the flight information handbook. Consideration will
         be given to the phase of flight and aircraft emergencies. When an airborne report is
         not accomplished, PICs must directly notify 618 AOC (TACC) or appropriate C2
         agency upon landing. In all cases ensure local C2 and Intel agencies are informed.
         2.5.4.1.5. Air to Air Refueling (AAR) Cancellation Policy. For 618 AOC (TACC)-
         controlled missions that were initially planned to include an AAR, if it is determined
         that a scheduled AAR is not required for mission accomplishment, as verified by
         current parameters and computer flight planning software, the flight manager (FM)
         will coordinate the cancellation of the AAR as early as possible in the schedule of
         events. The FM will immediately advise the tanker and airlift duty officers (DO), and
         the tanker DO will advise the tanker unit of the cancellation to allow the aircraft and
         crew to be released or reassigned to a different mission. The DO does not need to
         wait until crew show for crew input. On flight managed sorties this process will
         normally occur four to six hours prior to scheduled departure. If the AAR is not
         required for mission accomplishment but the PIC needs to perform the air to air
         refueling event prior to expiration of an evaluation or for required AAR currency, the
         PIC will contact the nearest C2 agency or stage manager to ensure that a departure leg
         info remark is entered into the form 59/GDSS 2 mission detail prior to entering crew
         rest. The remark will include the surname of the crew member(s) requiring the event.
     2.5.4.2. CONUS. Periodic ―ops normal‖ calls/transmissions are not required; however,
     the controlling C2 agency may increase reporting requirements.
     2.5.4.3. OCONUS. MAJCOM C2 agencies will specify increased reporting procedures
     through a communications plan in the OPLAN, OPORD, FRAG, Mission Directive, or
     FLIP. Aircrews will maintain listening watch in accordance with the communications
     plan within aircraft equipment capabilities (e.g. AOC, AERO-I, HF-Automatic Link
     Establishment (HF-ALE), L-Band SATCOM).
  2.5.5. Aircraft Status/Maintenance Discrepancy Reporting. PICs shall report aircraft system
  malfunctions that traditionally require extensive trouble shooting as soon as feasible.
  Contact arrival C2 agency if available, otherwise contact MAJCOM C2 for relay.
  2.5.6. ―Thirty Minute‖ Out Call. Transmit a UHF or VHF arrival advisory to the destination
  C2 agency approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. Provide Estimated Time in Blocks
  (ETB).
  2.5.7. Integrated Flight Management (IFM) Sorties. On IFM sorties, the flight managers
  (FM) will be the C2 conduit for aircrews. For critical C2 communications, voice
  communications are the primary method. EXCEPTION: For AFRC/ANG missions using
  IFM, AFRC/ANG will provide C2.
     2.5.7.1. Position Reporting on IFM Missions. IFM missions transiting oceanic flight
     information regions (FIRs) need to add the phrase ―Pass to Hilda‖ to ATC position
     reports (N/A for AOC / CDPLC sorties). Crews may also use the ARINC frequencies
     listed in the aircrew flimsy for C2 phone patch requirements. Use ARINC phone patch
     only after exhausting normal communication methods.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                        23


       2.5.7.2. The Flight Manager and PIC have specific duties that must be accomplished
       separately, but they share the responsibility for safe, risk-mitigated, effective and efficient
       sortie execution. Reference AFI 11-255v3 chapter 5 IFM Responsibilities.
   2.5.8. High Frequency (HF) Communications. HF is the primary means of voice access to
   the worldwide C2 network. When SELCAL is primary ATC, use AERO-I and/or AOC to
   monitor C2, in lieu of ALE. Ensure the other HF radio is not in ALE mode to preclude the
   automatic link (ALE) feature from overriding ATC messages.
2.6. Mission Commander (MC).
   2.6.1. Unit commanders shall designate a MC when more than two aircraft are assembled to
   perform missions away from home station. Unit commanders should consider appointing a
   MC for special, high-visibility missions (i.e. CAPSTONE, DV2, etc.). The MC has overall
   responsibility and is the final authority for decisions that impact mission execution. The MC
   shall properly coordinate mission details. For flight-managed sorties, MC shall coordinate
   any special mission planning requirements with the IFM mission allocator not later than 24
   hours prior to mission execution.
       2.6.1.1. For MAJCOM-tasked missions, MAJCOM/A3/DO will coordinate and
       designate a lead planning agency when more than one unit is involved in an AR, airdrop,
       or tactical airland operation. For AMC-tasked missions the planning agency is 618 AOC
       (TACC). For theater airlift missions with more than one airlift unit involved, the theater
       Air Operations Center (AOC) shall designate a central planning agency responsible for
       coordinating the entire mission with all involved agencies. The OG/CC for the lead
       planning agency will designate an MC. The MC will be a rated (normally field grade)
       officer qualified in the type mission.
       2.6.1.2. The MC will ensure all collocated aircrew members attend required briefings.
       2.6.1.3. When non-collocated, the MC (in conjunction with the lead planning agency)
       will ensure non-collocated aircrew members receive applicable information, to include
       rendezvous, formation, abort, and recovery procedures. The MC will provide controlling
       agency and all non-collocated PICs anticipated delays or mission changes.
2.7. Not Used.
2.8. C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. Crewmembers may use the 618 AOC (TACC) toll-free
number, 1-800-AIR-MOBL, or DSN 312-779-0320 to contact other offices within the 618 AOC
(TACC), including flight managers.
2.9. Close Watch Missions. Close Watch missions (for example, Combat Search and Rescue
(CSAR); Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), PHOENIX BANNERs) receive special C2 attention.
PICs will promptly notify appropriate C2 agency of delays, aborts, or other events that affect on-
time departure. Provide the C2 agent the estimated time in commission (ETIC), planned ETD,
and estimated time of arrival (ETA) within 10 minutes of the event or as soon as safety allows.
2.10. Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DOD) to
cooperate with civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-
801, Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, provides the policies and procedures
service members must follow when supporting federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement
 24                                 AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


agencies. Coordinate all civilian law enforcement authorities‘ requests for assistance through
appropriate C2 channels.
2.11. Enroute Maintenance Support. 618 AOC (TACC/XOCL) will support all mobility
aircraft requests for parts and/or maintenance assistance on TRANSCOM/AMC missions. Refer
to paragraph 2.8 for 618 AOC (TACC) telephone numbers.
2.12. (Added-DOVERAFB) Flight Authorizations. IAW (Holdover) AMC Guidance
Memorandum 11-1 for AFI 11-401: Units are authorized to make pen-and-ink changes to flight
authorizations; the authenticating official must initial each change. The NCOIC, Squadron
Aviation Resource Management, will set up procedures to ensure the authorizations are
published correctly. EXCEPTION: The aircraft commander shall approve pen-and-ink changes
made enroute, and file flight authorization pen-and-ink enroute changes with the Squadron
Aviation Resource Management (SARM) upon return to home station.
2.13. (Added-DOVERAFB) Incident Reporting. In addition to notifying command and
control, crews should report any unusual circumstances to home station leadership (on-call 24
hours a day through Dover Command Post). Such incidents may include, but are not limited to,
inadvertent flare launches, laser activity, damage to aircraft or airport, significant crew issues,
any reportable incident (e.g., Safety, Intel, police, etc.), and media exposure. When operating
out of a deployed location with deployed leadership, crews should report mission report
(MISREP) items (e.g., flare launches) to the deployed leadership. When in doubt, keep home
station leadership informed.

                      AIRCREW COMPLEMENT/MANAGEMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides guiding principles to form/manage mobility aircrews.
Commanders at all levels shall follow these policies to form aircrews and to develop aircrew-
related work/rest schedules that optimize efficiency of mobility forces engaged in worldwide
operations.
3.2. Aircrew Complement. SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on fragmentation order/mission
directive, Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP) requirements, aircrew member
qualifications, and other constraints to safely accomplish the mission tasking. Table 3.1. below
summarizes crew position requirements for different crew types.
   3.2.1. The minimum aircrew member complement for a local training flight is an aircraft
   commander, pilot, and loadmaster. When a mission requires more than one aircrew member
   at a position, the SQ/CC will determine whether an instructor and NMR crewmember meet
   mission requirements.
   3.2.2. SQ/CCs shall form augmented aircrews for missions planned to take longer than a
   basic CDT. Augmenting aircrew members must be current, qualified, and Mission Ready
   (MR) IAW AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 1. SQ/CC shall augment an aircrew for the full Flight Duty
   Period (FDP). The MAJCOM/A3/DO may augment aircrews while the flight is underway.
   (see paragraph 3.7, Aircrew Management, for more on CDT/FDP.)

Table 3.1. Aircrew Complement.

NOTES:
(1) Pilots who have graduated from the ACIQ course may augment the crew. Pilots who have
graduated from the PIQ course, (when approved by the Sq/CC) may act as the augmenting
crewmember.
(2) Two loadmasters or one loadmaster and one pilot are required if more than 40 passengers
are scheduled to be carried. Both crewmembers must remain in the cargo compartment, one
forward and one aft for takeoffs and landings.
EXCEPTION: On personnel airdrop sorties, only one loadmaster is required with more than
40 jumpers planning to jump. This exception does not apply to airland segments of an airdrop
mission.
 26                                 AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


(3) One loadmaster and another qualified crewmember/physiological technician are required
in the cargo compartment on any mission segment where cabin altitude exceeds 13,000 feet
MSL.
(4) For augmented airdrop missions, one loadmaster must be airdrop qualified; the other
loadmaster may be airland qualified.
(5) Two loadmasters are required for dual-row airdrop and JPADS missions. Both
loadmasters shall be qualified in the specific mission.
(6) For formation flight/airdrop, the following lead pilot requirements apply:
(a) Single-element formations. When the element consists of three aircraft, a lead pilot is
required in the formation (any position). Two ship elements do not require a lead certified
pilot.
(b) Multiple-element formations. A lead certified pilot is required in the lead, deputy lead and
element lead positions. If deputy lead or an element lead abort after station time, any crew can
assume their position with the concurrence of the mission commander. Any crew can fly the
last ship of a formation even if it is an element lead position.
(7) Basic + 1 (previously referred to as Combat Basic) is 2 pilots, 1 loadmaster, and 1
additional mission qualified C-17 pilot or loadmaster (additional crewmember will be dictated
by mission requirements).


3.3. Aircrew Member Qualification. An aircrew member will be qualified, or in qualification
training, to perform duties as a primary aircrew member.
   3.3.1. Senior leaders who complete a Senior Staff Qualification course (restricted AF Form 8
   Certificate of Aircrew Qualification) or orientation for a Senior Staff Familiarization flight
   may occupy a primary crew position when under direct instructor supervision. Refer to AFI
   11-401, Aviation Management, for procedures and requirements governing senior leader
   flying.
   3.3.2. Crewmembers who complete the Senior Staff Course will log ―FP‖ for Flight
   Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
   Document.
   3.3.3. Crewmembers who complete a Senior Staff Familiarization flight will log ―OP‖ for
   Flight Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight
   Data Document.
3.4. Pilots.
   3.4.1. An instructor pilot (IP) must supervise non-current or unqualified pilots regaining
   currency or qualification (direct IP supervision during critical phases of flight).
   3.4.2. Although an alternate aircraft commander may be in the seat, overall command of the
   mission, crew, and aircraft remains with the PIC. At no time should the crew have any
   doubt who is in command of the aircraft. To prevent confusion among the crew, a change of
   PIC will not occur during a flight duty period unless the off-going PIC is leaving the crew.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                    27


   3.4.3. SQ/CCs shall augment the PIC for missions over 16 hours Flight Duty Period (FDP)
   and designate those additional pilots authorized to perform PIC duties. The PIC shall brief
   the aircrew on the plan to transfer PIC duties.
   3.4.4. Graduates of Initial Qualification Course may accomplish receiver AR under IP
   supervision.
   3.4.5. Missions With Passengers. Only current and qualified pilots (possessing an AF Form
   8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification) will occupy pilot seats with passengers on board
   (N/A MEP).
       3.4.5.1. A non-current but qualified pilot may fly with passengers on board if under
       direct IP supervision.
       3.4.5.2. Pilots shall not fly touch-and-go landings with passengers. Touch-and-go and
       stop-and-go landings are authorized with Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) on board.
3.5. Not Used.
3.6. Loadmasters.
   3.6.1. A non-current or unqualified loadmaster may serve as a primary aircrew member on
   any mission when supervised by a qualified instructor or flight examiner (direct supervision
   for critical phases of flight).
   3.6.2. Multiple Loadmaster CRM. To ensure good CRM when there is a multiple
   loadmaster requirement, the primary loadmaster will assume overall responsibility for
   completion of all checklists. He or she will coordinate all responsibilities and ensure no
   confusion exists about what duties have been accomplished.
3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and en route C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles
permit an aircrew adequate time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for rest.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP). FDP is the period of time starting at mission report time
   and ending immediately after the aircrew completes the final engine shutdown of the day.
   SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Once en
   route, the mission directive or C2 agent will inform the PIC of expected FDP at show time.
   Reduce FDP when the autopilot fails after departure IAW information below. If the autopilot
   fails after departure, consider mission requirements and determine the best course of action to
   preclude further mission delays due to reduced FDP. The best course of action may include
   diverting to an airfield with maintenance capability. Contact C2, coordinate intentions, and
   comply with limitations.
       3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew (including Basic + 1)
       is 16 hours (12 hours when the autopilot is inoperative). All AAR and tactical events will
       be accomplished within the first 14 hours of the FDP. Once an aircrew begins a basic
       FDP, only MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend to augmented day regardless of aircrew
       composition (MAJCOM/A3/DO shall augment basic crew to extend FDP).
          3.7.1.1.1. When extended en route ground times, non-optimum routing/winds,
          weather delays or other extenuating circumstances will increase a basic to an
          augmented FDP, a PIC with an augmented crew may accept an augmented FDP as
          long as:
28                              AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


            3.7.1.1.1.1. The C2 agent or PIC discovers the extenuating circumstances before
            the first takeoff of the day.
            3.7.1.1.1.2. The PIC verifies all augmenting aircrew members can get adequate
            rest en route.
        3.7.1.1.2. A PIC with a basic crew may seek MAJCOM/A3/DO (mission execution
        authority) approval to extend the FDP as much as 2 hours to complete a scheduled
        mission. Only use this provision to recover from unscheduled/unplanned en route
        delays. C2 agents shall not ask PICs to exercise this option.
     3.7.1.2. Augmented Crew FDP. Maximum FDP for an augmented aircrew is 24 hours
     (16 hours when the autopilot is inoperative). All AAR and tactical events will be
     accomplished within the first 18 hours of the FDP. SQ/CC need only augment the pilot
     portion of the aircrew when the autopilot is inoperative.
        3.7.1.2.1. Two aircraft commanders are required if AAR is accomplished after 14
        hours flight duty period. Intent is to manage rest cycles to have one AC accomplish
        any AAR prior to the 14-hour point, and the second AC accomplishes the AAR past
        the 14 hour point. The second aircraft commander fulfills the requirement for an
        additional pilot. NOTE: A graduate of C-17 ACIQ or PCO, who has not yet been
        certified as an AC, may serve as the augmenting AC and perform the AAR as long as
        they are current and qualified.
        3.7.1.2.2. SQ/CC will augment an aircrew when FDP exceeds 16 hours and the
        mission profile will allow augmenting aircrew members adequate time to rest en
        route. As a minimum, the mission profile must provide the following:
            3.7.1.2.2.1. Mission profile shall include at least one 6 hour leg or two 4 hour
            legs. EXCEPTION: If the mission profile does not meet the leg length criteria
            above but includes at least one 5 hour leg or two 3 hour legs, the maximum FDP
            will be 18 hours. All A/R and tactical events will be accomplished within the first
            14 hours of the FDP. Once an aircrew begins an 18 hour augmented day, only
            MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend to a 24 hour augmented day. (All other
            restrictions still apply).
            3.7.1.2.2.2. Any AAR or airdrop shall count as an intermediate stop.
            EXCEPTION: Multiple drops conducted within 1 hour of each other are
            considered to be 1 airdrop for the purpose of ―intermediate stop‖.
            3.7.1.2.2.3. No more than 3 intermediate stops after 14 hours of FDP.
            3.7.1.2.2.4. The PIC shall validate planned leg times based on actual conditions.
            PICs may swap an extended ground time (4 hours) for a mission leg when
            conditions afford aircrew members a chance for rest.
     3.7.1.3. Maximum FDP for nuclear airlift missions IAW AFI 11-299, Nuclear Airlift
     Operations.
     3.7.1.4. Flight examiners administering evaluations will not exceed an augmented FDP.
     3.7.1.5. Training FDP. Maximum FDP for training, Off-Station Trainers (OST), Joint
     Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT), and Functional Check
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                             29


     Flights/Acceptance Check Flights (FCFs/ACFs) is 16 hours (12 hours when the autopilot
     is inoperative). Conduct the mission as follows:
         3.7.1.5.1. Not used.
         3.7.1.5.2. Complete all training events (i.e., FCF/ACF checks, transition events,
         AAR, or tactical events) during the first 12 hours of the FDP.
            3.7.1.5.2.1. ANG and AFRC crews may perform all mission-related events on
            local training missions provided their time from start of CDT/FDP does not
            exceed 16 hours.
                3.7.1.5.2.1.1. Crew duty time (CDT) and FDP include both military duty and
                civilian work. CDT and FDP begin when an individual reports for their first
                duty period (military or civilian).
  3.7.2. Crew Duty Time (CDT). CDT is that period of time an aircrew may perform
  combined ground/flight duties. Plan the mission so aircrew members may complete post-
  mission duties within maximum CDT. An aircrew member may perform mission-related
  duties for other missions when approved by member‘s home station SQ/CC or equivalent.
  Maximum CDT is 18+00 hours for a basic aircrew and 24+45 hours for an augmented
  aircrew.
  3.7.3. Except as outlined below, CDT/FDP begins 1 hour after aircrew alert notification.
  SQ/CC or equivalent may task aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin
  flight-related duties or MAJCOM/A3/DO may authorize a C2 agent to alert an aircrew
  member early: begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for those duties.
     3.7.3.1. Crews may self-alert with C2 (618 AOC (TACC) for AMC and AMC gained
     missions) concurrence prior to entering crew rest. The PIC must coordinate 618 AOC
     (TACC) approval required for AMC and AMC-gained missions) the self-alert time
     before entering crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for
     duty.
     3.7.3.2. CDT/FDP Extensions. See AFI 11-202V3. The 89 AW/CC and 6 AMW/CC
     are waiver authority for CVAM-directed special assignment airlift missions (SAAM)
     their aircrews support.
  3.7.4. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) Time. IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management,
  MAF aircrew members may travel as additional crewmembers (not required for the mission
  being flown but required for follow-on missions) as MEP. MEP will not be listed on the
  AFTO Form 781, will not log time, and will not accrue OFDA credit. Crewmembers may
  travel as MEP for a maximum of 24 hours. OG/CC or equivalent may approve crewmembers
  to travel as MEP in excess of 24 hours.
     3.7.4.1. Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after
     traveling in MEP status, provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at report
     time for flight in MEP status).
     3.7.4.2. Aircrew members may travel in MEP status after performing primary crew
     duties, for a maximum of 24 hours from the time the crewmember‘s FDP began.
 30                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo up-/off-
   load, start, or taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3. The CDT/FDP
   begins when the aircrew member reports for official duties.
3.8. Scheduling Restrictions. IAW AFI 11-202V3. In addition, SQ/CCs shall not schedule an
aircrew member to fly nor will an aircrew member perform aircrew duties:
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3.
   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff, or
   ALFA standby force legal for alert time, or earliest show time from BRAVO alert) or while
   impaired by its after effects.
   3.8.3. When using nasal sprays to treat symptoms of head congestion existing before flight.
   An aircrew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays as ―get-me-
   downs‖ following an unexpected ear or sinus block during flight. Following use,
   crewmember will be considered DNIF until cleared by a flight surgeon.
3.9. Fatigue Countermeasures Management Program.
   3.9.1. AMC/A3 will establish policy for implementation of the Fatigue Countermeasures
   (CM) Management Program and ensure compliance with its provisions, and AMC/SG will
   provide clinical oversight, guidance and materials for fatigue CM education and mitigation.
   3.9.2. OG/CCs will ensure Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs include use
   of the basic fatigue countermeasures found in the AvORM worksheet. Both the manual and
   automated ―MAF Mission Aviation ORM Worksheet‖ incorporate a fatigue CM risk
   assessment model. They are available on the AMC/A3V website under the ―Pubs‖ tab,
   ―Operational Risk Management (ORM)‖ section, and will be used by all three tiers of
   mission planners, as well as aircrew during the mission execution phase.
   3.9.3. Flight surgeons will use the AMC-approved (lead command) fatigue CM training CDs
   and pamphlets provided by AMC/SGP to educate their operational fliers in venues such as
   clinic visits, flight physicals, Safety Down Days, pre-deployment briefings, readiness
   training, Commanders' Calls, First-Term Airmen Courses, base orientations and safety
   meetings.
   3.9.4. The primary fatigue CM available to aircrew members is appropriate management of
   their sleep/rest cycles. Secondary CM include smart scheduling procedures aimed at
   managing those cycles, strategic inflight and/or ground napping techniques, and proper diet
   and exercise.
   3.9.5. An additional fatigue CM tool available to aircrew is the No-Go Pill. The occasional
   use of a No-Go Pill by MAF aircrew to improve sleep quality and/or adjust circadian rhythm
   sleep/wake cycles is voluntary. Each individual aircrew member will, with the aid of their
   home station flight surgeon, determine how/if to implement the use of No-Go Pills as a
   fatigue CM.
   3.9.6. The following directives concerning the use of No-Go Pills are as important and
   unbreakable as the ―12 hour bottle to throttle‖ restriction for alcohol consumption:
      3.9.6.1. Aircrew members on flight orders will not use No-Go Pills in flight.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                   31


     3.9.6.2. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for any No-Go Pill they are
     authorized to use for operational purposes and document using MAF No-Go Pill Form 1,
     Ground Testing of No-Go Pills. In order to avoid possible drug interactions, aircrew
     members will inform the flight surgeon of any over-the-counter medications and/or
     nutritional supplements they are taking. During ground testing, aircrew members will be
     DNIF on an AF Form 1042 for the minimum ‗DNIF‘ periods prescribed in paragraph
     3.9.6.4. below. After ground testing of a particular No-Go Pill, the flight surgeon will
     complete the bottom half of the Form 1 and a ―return to fly‖ AF Form 1042. Successful
     ground testing of a particular No-Go Pill establishes clearance to use it operationally
     IAW the Official Air Force Approved Medication guidlines.
     3.9.6.3. Aircrew members may obtain NoGo Pills from any USAF or other authorized
     flight surgeon while at home station or off-station while TDY/deployed. Off-
     station/deployed flight surgeons will verify individual aircrew ground testing results via
     the ―MAF Aircrew Medication Ground Test Card‖ all MAF aircrew members are
     required to carry.
     3.9.6.4. In no case will an individual perform aircrew duties while under the effects of
     No-Go Pills. Individuals will use the mission report or legal for alert time to determine
     the latest time to take a No-Go Pill. The following are the minimum ‗DNIF‘ periods (no
     AF Form 1042 required) after consuming a No-Go Pill:
        3.9.6.4.1. Sonata (Zaleplon) – 4 hours minimum ‗DNIF‘
        3.9.6.4.2. Ambien (Zolpidem) – 6 hours minimum ‗DNIF‘
        3.9.6.4.3. Restoril (Temazepam, Class IV Controlled Substance) – 12 hours
        minimum ‗DNIF‘.            NOTE: No-Go medications can affect individuals very
        differently. To comply with the ―no aircrew duties while under the effects‖
        restriction, it is the responsibility of each individual aircrew member to be aware of
        their own minimum ‗DNIF‘ period for any No-Go Pill they use, based on their
        ground trial results and/or previous experiences.
     3.9.6.5. Aircrew members will consider the following examples of missions prone to
     causing fatigue and/or sleep disruptions in their decision to use a No-Go Pill after non-
     medicinal counter measures have been unsuccessful:
        3.9.6.5.1. Home station night launch missions with 2000-0530L show times and
        greater than four hours‘ duration.
        3.9.6.5.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal (i.e., quiet, air-conditioned,
        darkened) sleeping environment.
        3.9.6.5.3. Off-station missions that are four or more time zones from home station.
        3.9.6.5.4. Rotating or stair-stepped flying schedules with greater than 6-hour flight
        time duration.
        3.9.6.5.5. Missions that run consistently near a 12 to 14 hour duty day.
     3.9.6.6. The MAF‘s worldwide mobility mission makes accountability for this program
     challenging; therefore, the following are aircrew member responsibilities:
 32                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


          3.9.6.6.1. Aircrew members will not operate heavy equipment during the minimum
          ‗DNIF‘ period for each No-Go Pill outlined in paragraph 3.9.6.4. above.
          3.9.6.6.2. Aircrew members will not take No-Go Pills within 12 hours of consuming
          alcohol, as their combined use unpredictably increases the effects of both.
          3.9.6.6.3. Aircrew members will limit use of Ambien (Zolpidem) and Restoril
          (Temazepam) to a maximum of seven consecutive days and no more than 20 days in
          a 60-day period. Flight surgeons may prescribe up to 60 days‘ worth of medication
          (20 pills) at a time if requested by the aircrew member, unless clinically inadvisable.
          3.9.6.6.4. Aircrew members will limit use of Sonata (Zaleplon) to a maximum of 10
          consecutive days and no more than 28 days in a 60-day period. Flight surgeons
          should prescribe 60 days‘ worth of medication (28 pills) if requested by the aircrew
          member, unless clinically inadvisable.
          3.9.6.6.5. If an aircrew member uses Sonata in combination with either of the other
          types of No-Go Pills, the seven consecutive days and 20-days in a 60 day period
          restrictions apply (overrides the 10 consecutive days and 28 days in a 60-day period
          for Sonata).
          3.9.6.6.6. Aircrew members may consume more than one No-Go Pill in a 24-hour
          period, if operationally necessary. A second No-Go Pill of the same or different type
          will not be consumed while in the minimum ‗DNIF‘ period for the previous pill.
          3.9.6.6.7. The ―MAF No-Go Pill Usage/Refill Form‖ will be used to document No-
          Go Pill use and refill authorization, and placed in the aircrew member‘s medical
          record. Non-duty station flight surgeons will forward the form to the aircrew
          member‘s home station aerospace medicine clinic to be placed in their medical
          record. Flight surgeons will immediately discuss any concerns about an aircrew
          member‘s use of No-Go Pills with the individual‘s commander if any question of
          misuse arises.
          3.9.6.6.8. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will
          follow PRP notification procedures if prescribed No-Go Pills.
3.10. Crew Rest/En route Ground Time. OG/CCs shall establish procedures to place
crewmembers in crew rest. MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive any portion of the crew rest period or
ground time as needed to meet mission tasking.
   3.10.1. Home-Station Pre-Departure Crew Rest. For missions that will keep aircrew
   members off station 16 hours or more, unit commanders will enter primary and MEP aircrew
   members into pre-departure crew rest 24 hours before the legal for alert time. Aircrew
   members may perform limited non-flying duties like mission planning during the first 12
   hours of pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may waive any portion of the first 12 hours of
   pre-departure crew rest. Do not manifest aircrew members traveling in MEP status as
   passengers to deny pre-departure crew rest. EXCEPTION: ACC, AFRC, ANG, and AETC
   in accordance with AFI 11-202V3 General Flight Rules and appropriate supplement.
   3.10.2. Off-station/En route Crew Rest. The minimum en route crew rest period is 12 hours
   before legal for alert or scheduled report time when self-alerting.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                 33


     3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/A3/DO, C2 agents
     shall not disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When necessary to interrupt aircrew
     members‘ crew rest period, re-enter that aircrew in a subsequent minimum 12 hour crew
     rest period after they complete official duties.
     3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-
     flight duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, refueling, cargo on-/off-
     load, aircrew arming, minor maintenance, or mission debriefing.
  3.10.3. Off-station/En route Ground Time. Mobility planners shall provide aircrews at least
  16+30 hours (nuclear airlift missions will be IAW AFI 11-299) ground time between engine
  shutdown and subsequent takeoff.
     3.10.3.1. Mission planners, PICs, or C2 agents may modify ground time as follows:
         3.10.3.1.1. In the interest of safety.
         3.10.3.1.2. To start (mission reporting time) no earlier than 12 hours from the time
         the aircrew entered crew rest. Before reducing ground time, PICs will consider time
         to complete mission planning, cargo on-/off-load, and non-standard mission related
         duties. C2 agents will not ask PICs to accept less than 16+30 hours ground time.
     3.10.3.2. Mobility planners should construct mission itineraries with en route ground
     times longer than 16+30 hours to afford aircrew members opportunities to recover from
     the cumulative effects of fatigue caused by flying on several consecutive days or due to
     transiting several time zones. If practical, make the en route ground time 36 hours
     (maximum) after three consecutive near maximum FDPs.
  3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-of-
  flight delay but provides PICs a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert and
  report period outside normal duty time. CECR periods should be of minimum duration and
  are normally used during de-positioning legs. Tasking authorities shall approve requests to
  delay alert time to normalize the work-rest cycle or increase messing options when mission
  allows. When requests are disapproved, the C2 agent will inform the PIC of the reason for
  disapproval.
  3.10.5. Post-Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning to
  home base sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to
  personal needs. PMCR begins upon mission termination. (N/A ACC, AFRC, ANG, and
  AETC.).
     3.10.5.1. For missions that keep an aircrew off station 16 or more hours, the SQ/CC shall
     provide 1 hour (up to 96 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter aircrew
     members in pre-departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires.
     3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and MAJCOM/A3/DO may
     suspend PMCR during contingency operations.
     3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
  3.10.6. Crew Chief Work/Rest Plan. While on Temporary Duty (TDY), the deployed crew
  chief or MEP maintenance technician shall report to the PIC. In conjunction with en
  route/transient maintenance supervisor, the PIC will determine how long the crew chief can
 34                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   safely perform aircraft maintenance duties. The PIC shall ensure the crew chief has
   sufficient time in each 24-hour period to get 8 hours of uninterrupted rest. See AFI 21-101,
   Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, for detailed guidance.
   3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved crew rest
   criteria in the Exercise or Contingency Operation Order (OPORD), Operation Plan (OPLAN)
   or Concept of Operations (CONOPs).
   3.10.8. The Prime Knight program streamlines the process of getting aircrews from aircraft
   parking ramp into lodging/crew rest. It is only successful when billeting agents receive
   accurate aircrew/mission information in a timely manner.
       3.10.8.1. C2 Agent Responsibilities. A MAJCOM C2 agent will forward information on
       the departing aircrew‘s orders to a point of contact (POC) for the next crew rest
       location‘s Prime Knight function.
       3.10.8.2. PIC Responsibilities. If departing from a location with a C2 agency, ensure a
       C2 agent has accurate aircrew/mission information to forward to the next Prime Knight
       POC. If departing from a facility without a C2 agency, the PIC will call the next crew
       rest location Prime Knight POC to pass aircrew/mission information.
       3.10.8.3. SQ/CC or designated authenticating official shall ensure TDY/Flight orders
       clearly indicate the unit fund cite so that the PIC may make Prime Knight reservations in
       advance. Without a unit fund cite on the TDY/Flight orders, the PIC must make advance
       reservations using a government travel card to participate in the Prime Knight program.
3.11. Alerting Procedures. MAJCOM C2 agents shall establish a legal for alert time with the
PIC and when appropriate, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) of Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)
crews. Whenever possible, C2 agents will inform PICs and MCDs of aircraft status, expected
patient up load time, and other pertinent mission details that will streamline mission launch.
   3.11.1. Aircrew alert time is normally 3+45 hours (4+15 for airdrop missions) before
   scheduled takeoff time (allows 1 hour for reporting and 2+45 hours (3+15 for airdrop
   missions) for mission preparation). Individual locations may increase or decrease this time
   depending on specific capabilities. OG/CCs may establish self-alert procedures for local
   training missions.
       3.11.1.1. For missions with more than minimum ground time, the PIC may arrange an
       alert time that provides additional preparation time to accomplish the mission. The PIC
       may also accept alerting with reduced preparation time when the mission allows. In all
       cases, the PIC shall coordinate changes to standard alerting times with the appropriate C2
       agency.
       3.11.1.2. With PIC agreement and when cargo load warrants (i.e. outsized and Technical
       Order (TO) 1C-17A-1- 9 section VI cargo), C2 agents may alert loadmasters up to 2
       hours before normal alert time. When early alerting is warranted, the PIC and C2 agent
       must notify the loadmaster before he/she enters crew rest. Do not alert the loadmaster
       more than 1 hour before beginning cargo up load. Base the aircrew FDP on the
       loadmaster‘s show time.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                     35


      3.11.1.3. C2 agents shall not alert an aircrew until the aircraft is in commission or there
      is reasonable assurance that maintenance technicians will complete repairs that allow the
      aircrew time to pre-flight and load the aircraft to meet the target takeoff time.
      3.11.1.4. C2 agents shall not alert outbound crews when inbound aircraft is on A-2 or A-
      3 status until maintenance technicians determine required parts are available, the aircraft
      will be repaired within the target ground time, and will be mission capable for the follow
      on mission.
      3.11.1.5. Self-Alerts. Crews will self-alert at locations without a C2 agency, but must
      coordinate with controlling C2 agency. The PIC may elect to self-alert on operational
      missions at locations with a C2 agency. Coordinate the alert time with local C2 agents to
      avoid FDP limitations that result from unexpected changes in the mission.
   3.11.2. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
      3.11.2.1. On the aircrew‘s initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2
      agent, or PIC during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time.
      3.11.2.2. For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected
      alert time. The PIC may extend that window to 8 hours when flying as primary crew or
      12 hours when traveling as MEP. The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to accept
      more than the 6 hour window. ANG/ AFRC aircrew members may extend the window as
      necessary to travel as MEP to home station to meet the Firm Scheduled Return Time
      (FSRT).
      3.11.2.3. When a C2 agent determines circumstances will not allow for aircrew alerting
      during the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time,
      the C2 agent will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12 hours
      from the time of notification.
      3.11.2.4. If the mission cannot depart within 4+00 hours of any scheduled takeoff, the
      PIC may continue the mission after a thorough re-evaluation of all ORM factors. The
      controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to accept a takeoff outside of the 4 hour
      window. The PIC will coordinate with C2 to continue the mission or enter crew rest and
      establish a legal for alert time.
3.12. Stage Management.
   3.12.1. Stage Posture. Stages operate on a positive launch principle. C2 agents shall alert
   aircrews using the following priority/hierarchy:
      3.12.1.1. Aircrews that require an emergency return to home station.
      3.12.1.2. De-positioning stage crews will be prioritized by their SRTs.
      3.12.1.3. Aircrews in sequence of arrival time.
      3.12.1.4. If the stage manager returns an aircrew in the stage to crew rest because of a
      mission delay or abort, that aircrew becomes first out when legal for alert.
   3.12.2. Mechanical Stage. A C2 agent may create a mechanical stage when a delayed or
   aborted mission will not resume before that aircrew‘s FDP expires. Aircrews in a
   mechanical stage will be first out when a mission in the same direction transits their location
 36                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   while they are legal for alert. A C2 agent may bump an inbound aircrew with FDP to
   complete that mission to cycle aircrews in a mechanical stage. C2 agents should not
   normally establish a mechanical stage for ANG and AFRC crews flying unit-equipped
   aircraft.
3.13. Standby Force Duty. MAJCOM C2 Agents shall task units for Standby Force Duty not
later than 18 hours prior to legal for alert time. This allows crewmembers 12 hours of pre-
standby crew rest and 6 hours for aircraft pre-flight duty. When aircrews are unable to complete
all preflight duties within 6 hours of crew show time, provide an additional 12-hour pre-standby
crew rest. If MAJCOM C2 agents are unable to provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall
place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest and follow aircraft generation procedures in
paragraph 3.7.5 to prepare the aircraft for launch. SQ/CC or MAJCOM C2 agency may keep an
aircrew in ALFA/BRAVO status up to 48 hours. MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend this period for
contingencies. After completion of an alert period, launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12
hour pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may provide additional local procedures for management
of Standby Force Duties.
   3.13.1. ALFA Standby Aircraft Preflight Generation and Security. When tasked, SQ/CC or
   MAJCOM C2 agency shall posture an aircraft and aircrew as an ALFA Standby Force able
   to launch within 1 hour. The following procedures apply to primary aircraft as well as spare
   aircraft generated for ALFA alerts. A maintenance T.O 1C-17A-6and aircrew T.O 1C-17A-
   1preflight must be completed. Preflight validity will be in accordance with applicable T.O.
   After the preflight, the PIC will notify the controlling agency. The aircraft will remain in a
   sealed posture and be referred to as ―cocked on alert‖. Documentation of when the aircraft
   was cocked on alert must be placed in the forms. The PIC will ensure the aircraft is secure
   before entering crew rest. Secure all hatches and doors to show unauthorized entry. The
   aircrew preflight portion remains valid if performed by one crew, cocked on alert, and
   launched by another crew. Uncocking a generated aircraft is not a standard procedure but
   may be accomplished on a case by case basis. The PIC or a designated aircrew
   representative must be present if access to the aircraft is required. Ensure command and
   control and the controlling agency are notified when uncocking and recocking generated
   aircraft. Follow-on pre-flights done during normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest.
   Begin CDT/FDP when C2 agent directs the aircrew to launch from crew rest or while
   performing pre-flight (begin CDT/FDP when the aircrew arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-
   flight).
   3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC or MAJCOM C2 agency shall
   posture an aircraft and/or aircrew in BRAVO Standby Force to permit launch within 3 hours.
   Follow-on pre-flights, if required, interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when aircrew shows
   for duty.
   3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC or MAJCOM C2 agency shall
   posture aircrews as a CHARLIE Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours.
   Tasked aircrews will be legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. SQ/CC or
   MAJCOM C2 agency may keep aircrews in CHARLIE status up to 72 hours. After 72 hours,
   release aircrews or enter them into 12 hours crew rest for directed mission, training mission,
   or subsequent standby force duty.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                   37


  3.13.4. Wing Standby Force. OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status. After a
  12 hour pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be
  able to launch within 3+15 hours. After 12 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrews in 12
  hour crew rest period before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty.
  3.13.5. Post-Standby Missions. On completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be
  dispatched on a mission. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start
  of pre-departure crew rest. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the
  post-mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time.
  3.13.6. Post Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following
  standby duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
     3.13.6.1. If standby duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is
     computed from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
     3.13.6.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is
     authorized.
  3.13.7. J-Alert (JCS-directed alert force). Alert aircrew will be provided 12 hours crew rest
  prior to alert duty. Alert crew may be considered in crew rest upon termination of a flight,
  even though remaining on alert. If a crew completes a mission within their alert cycle, they
  are legal for alert again after 12 hours of crew rest. The length of a J-Alert tour will be
  determined by the OG/CC, but will not exceed 192 hours/8 days.
     3.13.7.1. J-Alert crews will not be used as preflight crews for aircraft other than their
     own alert aircraft or its replacement.
     3.13.7.2. J-Alert crew members may complete ground currency events and limited office
     duties at their leisure while on alert; however, they will not accomplish those items that
     result in DNIF status.
     3.13.7.3. Flying during alert is authorized with the following restrictions:
         3.13.7.3.1. At the discretion of the individual, not to exceed a flight duty period of 6
         hours.
         3.13.7.3.2. Crew members may fly for individual currency or Special
         Operations/Boat Drop training. These crewmembers are not to be used as an
         instructor/examiner pool.
         3.13.7.3.3. The alert aircraft and crew integrity are not required if recovery and re-
         launch can be accomplished within 1.5 hours of real world alert launch notification. If
         this timing cannot be met, the integral alert crew and aircraft must be used to allow
         airborne diversion.
         3.13.7.3.4. Special Operations training may be accomplished provided the crew
         members are allowed to adjust their work/rest cycle.
         3.13.7.3.5. Crew duty time (CDT) for real world crisis response will begin when the
         crew shows for the real world mission.
  3.13.8. (Added-DOVERAFB) P-Alert. Alert aircrew will be provided 12 hours crew rest
  prior to alert duty. Alert crew may be considered in crew rest upon termination of a flight,
 38                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   even though remaining on alert. If a crew completes a mission within their alert cycle, they
   are legal for alert again after 12 hours of crew rest. The length of a P-Alert tour will be
   determined by the OG/CC and normally be less than 14 days. A P-Alert tour length
   exceeding this duration requires OG/CC approval. Crews must review AMCI 11-206 Dover
   AFB Sup for detailed guidance on P-Alert
       3.13.8.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) P-Alert crew members may complete ground currency
       events and limited office duties at their leisure while on alert, however, they will not
       accomplish those items that result in DNIF or unqualified status.
       3.13.8.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Flying on a local training sortie during alert is
       permitted but should be avoided. Crew members that fly while on alert must notify the
       SQ/DO prior to departure. The following restrictions apply when flying while on alert:
           3.13.8.2.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) At the discretion of the individual, not to exceed
           a crew duty time of 8 hours.
           3.13.8.2.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Crew members fly for individual currency.
           These crewmembers are not to be used as an instructor/examiner pool.
           3.13.8.2.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) The alert aircraft and crew integrity are not
           required if recovery can be accomplished within 3 hours of real world alert launch
           notification. If this timing cannot be met, the integral alert crew and aircraft must be
           used to allow airborne diversion.
           3.13.8.2.4. (Added-DOVERAFB) Except during an actual aircraft emergency,
           landings (to include Touch and Go) are not authorized at locations other than the alert
           base.
           3.13.8.2.5. (Added-DOVERAFB) Crew duty time (CDT) for real world crisis
           response will begin when the crew shows for the real world mission.
           3.13.8.2.6. (Added-DOVERAFB) Crews must establish a method to relay alert
           information with Dover AFB Command Post once airborne (ie AOC, AERO-I,
           UHF,VHF).
3.14. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. Refer to DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation,
AFI 11-401, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
3.15. Interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs or equivalent to permit the
exchange or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft between mobility units to
accomplish flying missions. Interfly will be limited to specific operations, exercises, or special
circumstances. However, it may be used for events of longer duration such as unit conversion to
another model design series (MDS). AFRC/A3 has delegated interfly approval authority to unit
OG/CCs for active duty/ANG interfly with AFRC and AFRC to AFRC interfly. Units utilizing
this authority will inform AFRC/A3V. NGB/A3 has delegated approval authority to Wing
Commanders for active duty/AFRC interfly with ANG, and OG/CC approval authority for ANG
to ANG interfly. ANG units will ensure appropriate active duty General Officer support staff
has notified the Air Force Directorate of Personnel General Officer Management Office
(AF/DPG) prior to any active duty General Officer flying with their unit. Participating aircrews
will use guidelines established by the host command or as specified in the OPLAN or CONOPS.
EXCEPTION: AE crewmembers are exempt from interfly requirements.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  39


   3.15.1. Aircrew members shall be current and qualified in the MDS, as well as unique
   systems or configuration required to fly the aircraft/mission.
   3.15.2. Each affected group commander who commits resources (personnel or aircraft) must
   concur with interfly proposal.
   3.15.3. MDS conversion training.
   3.15.3.1. Units may request an interfly agreement for duration of their conversion. OG/CCs
   will forward interfly requests to individual OG/CCs for approval. Requests will include as a
   minimum a list of affected units, duration of the agreement, and purpose.
3.16. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP). Procedures and policies regarding MEP are
contained in AFI 11-401 and AMCI 11-208. PICs will ensure personnel traveling in this status
are properly authorized. Crewmembers qualified in mobility aircraft are authorized MEP status
on any mobility aircraft to pre/de-position in support of mobility operations. MAJCOM
designated crewmembers who are assigned or authorized to accompany the normal crew
compliment are allowed MEP status.
   3.16.1. Crewmembers in MEP status are not authorized to:
       3.16.1.1. Displace manifested passengers.
       3.16.1.2. Maintain currency and/or log flying time.
       3.16.1.3. Use for transportation while on leave. EXCEPTION: ANG/AFRC Air
       Technicians may be in a civilian leave status while traveling en route to perform in a
       military duty status.
       3.16.1.4. Travel on Special Air Missions/Command Support Mission (SAM/CSM)
       aircraft unless authorized by HQ AF/CVAM through the PIC.
       3.16.1.5. Travel on Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) when specifically
       restricted by the mission directive.
       3.16.1.6. Travel on Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft unless authorized by Joint
       Operational Support Airlift Command (JOSAC) through the PIC.
   3.16.2. All MEPs require valid travel/flight orders or supporting message authorizing MEP
   status. OG/CCs may authorize MEP status for their mobility aircrews.
   3.16.3. Flight evaluators have priority and will not be displaced by any other MEP. The
   priority for evaluators is MAJCOM, NAF, group, and then squadron level.
   3.16.4. MEPs normally travel in the crew compartment. If the number of MEPs desiring
   travel exceeds the capacity of the crew compartment, the C2 agency will notify the ATOC,
   who in turn will coordinate with the passenger terminal; seats not previously assigned may be
   used for MEPs.
   3.16.5. The PIC, or designated representative, will brief MEPs on seat assignment,
   appropriate mission information, emergency procedures including egress, and armed
   crewmembers. The PIC may assign an MEP aircrew-related duties for which the MEP is
   qualified.

   3.16.6. MEPs will coordinate their travel with the appropriate C2 agency prior to travel.
   They will process through the C2 agency as early as possible but NLT 3 hours prior to
   planned block time.
3.17. Mission Mobility Observers (MMO). MAJCOM supplements or additional directives
may establish programs authorizing senior military and civilian personnel to fly for mobility
mission familiarization. For AMC MMO information reference AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift
Operations.
3.18. Flight Attendants on Distinguished Visitor Missions. Flight attendants may fly as
primary crewmembers on designated C-17 missions. They fall under the authority of the PIC, or
MC (if assigned), throughout the mission. An egress briefing will be given to the flight
attendants prior to the first mission leg.

                                           Chapter 4

                        AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. Redundant systems may allow crews to safely perform some missions when a
component/system is degraded. The PIC is the final authority in determining the overall
suitability of an aircraft for the mission. The PIC will ensure a detailed explanation of the
discrepancy is entered in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document;
include the following maintenance identifiers to effectively communicate aircraft status.
   4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component essential for safe aircraft operation as ME.
   4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component, which is not currently essential for safe aircraft operation as MC. These
   discrepancies should be cleared at the earliest opportunity. If circumstances change or
   mission safety would be compromised, re-designate as ME. Do not delay a mission to clear a
   MC discrepancy.
   4.1.3. Open Item (OI). The PIC will designate discrepancies not expected to adversely
   impact the current mission or any subsequent mission as an OI. These items are normally
   cleared at home station.
4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. The MEL is a pre-launch document that lists
the minimum equipment/systems to operate the aircraft. It is impractical to prepare a list that
would anticipate all possible combinations of equipment malfunctions and contingent
circumstances. Consider equipment/systems with no listed exceptions as grounding items. A
PIC who accepts an aircraft with degraded equipment/systems is not committed to subsequent
operations with the same degraded equipment. PICs are not committed to operations with
degraded equipment accepted by another PIC.
   4.2.1. The PIC shall account for the possibility of additional failures during continued
   operation with inoperative systems or components. The MEL is not intended for continued
   operation over an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative.
   4.2.2. All emergency equipment will be installed unless specifically exempted by mission
   requirements/directives.
   4.2.3. Waiver Policy. A PIC prepared to operate with a degraded MEL item shall request a
   waiver through C2 channels. The PIC shall provide the C2 agent: 1) nature of request, 2)
   individual crew member qualification, 3) mission leg(s) requiring the waiver, 4) weather or
   other adverse condition, and 5) the governing directive of waiver request to include volume,
   chapter, or paragraph. Initiate waiver requests as soon as possible; plan at least a 1-hour
   waiver process time.
   4.2.4. PICs operating with waiver(s) for degraded equipment shall coordinate mission
   requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements,
   etc.) with the controlling C2 agency and/or flight manager.
   4.2.5. If beyond C2 communication capability, or when it is necessary to protect the crew or
   aircraft from a situation not covered by this chapter and immediate action is required, the PIC
 42                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   may deviate according to paragraph 1.4 Report deviations (without waiver) through channels
   to MAJCOM/A3/DO within 48-hours. OG/CCs shall collect background information and
   submit a follow-up written report upon request.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waivers to operate with degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-
case basis. If time allows, the PIC will coordinate with the lowest practical level
(assigned/deployed OGV in most cases) to determine the need for a waiver. If the determination
is to request an MEL waiver, the PIC will initiate the MEL waiver request through the
appropriate C2 agency, detailed below. The PIC is the final authority to determine whether a
waiver will or will not be requested. MEL waiver authority is as follows:
   4.3.1. Training Missions. OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority.
       4.3.1.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Waiver Requests. All waiver requests will be processed
       through Dover AFB Command Post.
   4.3.2. MAJCOM Directed Missions. MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority.
   Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency.
       4.3.2.1. The 18 AF/CC is the waiver authority for active duty, AFRC, or ANG units
       flying 618 AOC (TACC)-directed missions (includes Operational Readiness Inspections).
       The MEL waiver authority has been delegated to AMC/A3V. Contact HQ AMC/A3V
       through 618 AOC (TACC).
       4.3.2.2. 613 AOC-directed missions (includes Operational Readiness Inspections). The
       PACAF/A3 is the waiver authority. The MEL waiver authority has been delegated to
       PACAF/A3T. Contact HQ PACAF/A3TV through the 613 AOC.
   4.3.3. Contingency Missions. COMAFFOR (or equivalent) for the agency with C2, if not
   specified in the OPORD/Tasking Order.
   4.3.4. ANG or AFRC Directed Missions. ANG or AFRC maintains C2 and waiver authority
   for ANG or AFRC directed mission prior to mobilization. NGB/A3 delegates waiver
   authority to the unit OG/CC.
   4.3.5. Other Than MEL Waivers. Determine governing source document (i.e. AFI, Flight
   Manual, Maintenance T.O., etc.) to ascertain the waiver authority. Use C2 channels to notify
   the appropriate waiver authority. Waivers of this nature may require an extended response
   time.
   4.3.6. Engineering Dispositions (ED). Dispositions are requested when aircraft are damaged
   and/or established maintenance technical order procedures cannot be followed or do not
   exist. The on-site maintenance authority is responsible for requesting Engineering
   Dispositions. Most EDs allow maintenance to repair the aircraft and return it to unrestricted
   status; dispositions of this nature do not concern aircrews. However, EDs affecting aircrew
   operations require MEL waiver authority approval.
       4.3.6.1. PIC‘s shall coordinate dispositions containing flight restrictions, prohibitions,
       additional operating limits, or modified/nonstandard operating procedures with the
       appropriate MEL waiver authority (see paragraph 4.3.)
       4.3.6.2. PIC‘s will not accept dispositions appearing incomplete, in error, or unsafe.
       Prior to rejecting a disposition, the PIC will contact the appropriate MEL waiver
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                    43


       authority. The waiver authority will attempt to resolve the issue.    NOTE: Deviations
       from the flight manual requires approval IAW the flight manual.
4.4. Technical Assistance. The PIC may request technical support and additional assistance
from their home unit or MAJCOM C2 agency.
   4.4.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) When OGV assistance is required, aircrews should contact
   Dover AFB Command Post, DSN 445-4201 or Commercial (302) 677-4201, to establish a
   phone patch with the applicable on-call OGV representative. 512th OG aircrew contact the
   512th AW Wing Operations Center (Liberty Ops DSN 445 3800 or Commercial (320) 677-
   3800) and speak to the On-Call OGV Representative or the On-Call OG Staff Officer. When
   beyond command and control capability, the PIC retains ultimate authority and
   responsibility; in these cases, contact OGV as soon as practical after the flight. Dover crews
   should request technical support and additional assistance from home unit or the appropriate
   A3 or A4 agency. Work higher headquarters assistance requests through Tanker Airlift
   Control Center to the maximum extent possible.
4.5. MEL Table Definitions/Column Identifiers. MEL tables are arranged by aircraft system
to provide the PIC a mechanism to determine minimum system requirements. Components are
listed by number installed and minimum required for flight. Requirements are defined by Home
Station Departure/Main Operating Base (MOB) (Column A) and en route stations (Column B).
Local training missions, to include off-station trainers, fall under Column B. An asterisk (*) in
the Required column indicates the number required is situation dependent; refer to the
Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions column for clarification. AMC and AMC gained aircrews will
consider Charleston AFB, Dover AFB, Elmendorf AFB, Hickam AFB, Jackson ANGB, March
ARB, McChord AFB, McGuire AFB, and Travis AFB as MOBs. When transiting a MOB on a
pre-positioning or an active leg of a mission use Column A. When transiting a MOB on a de-
positioning leg use Column B. EXAMPLE: A McChord C-17 transiting Charleston en route to
Ramstein AB will use Column A. However, when transiting Charleston en route to McChord
(de-positioning) use Column B. NOTE: Column B requirements will not normally be waived
when transiting a MOB on a de-positioning leg.
   4.5.1. Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions. Some technical information and procedures are
   contained in this column. This is not all-inclusive; crewmembers shall refer to the flight
   manual and other directives for procedures, techniques, limitations, etc.
       4.5.1.1. One-time Flight Clarification: Although a one-time flight may be authorized
       IAW the MEL, maintenance release (clearing the Red X) will still be required. A Red X
       discrepancy must be downgraded through maintenance channels prior to flight. Contact
       618 AOC (TACC) to coordinate the Red X discrepancy downgrade from the MXG/CC
       that owns the aircraft. This condition does not preclude carrying cargo and passengers
       unless stipulated otherwise by the waiver. The priority is to move the airplane to a repair
       capable facility. PICs must coordinate with appropriate agencies to ensure repair
       capability exists at the destination. One-time flights may include en route stops only
       when necessary to recover the airplane. EXAMPLE: An airplane departs on a gear-
       down flight from Djibouti IAP and requires an en route fuel stop (Cairo) before landing
       at the nearest repair capable facility, Sigonella NAS.
           4.5.1.1.1. One-time flight to nearest repair capable facility: Flight is limited to the
           nearest (shortest en route time) repair capable base.
 44                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


          4.5.1.1.2. One-time flight to a repair capable facility: Flight is not restricted to the
          nearest repair capable facility.
       4.5.1.2. Other Mission and Repair Clarifications:
          4.5.1.2.1. Shall be repaired at next repair capable facility: Mission may continue as
          scheduled, item shall be repaired upon reaching a repair capable facility. Designate
          item ME upon reaching repair facility. Once maintenance action is initiated, and it is
          determined repairs are not possible, the PIC will discuss possible courses of action
          with C2 agency to return aircraft to service.
          4.5.1.2.2. Mission dictates requirement: PIC shall consider the entire mission profile,
          not just the next leg. EXAMPLE: An airplane is departing an en route station with
          repair capability, after engine start it is discovered that the #1 engine anti-ice is
          inoperative. Icing conditions are not forecasted for the next leg. However, because
          the mission spans several days and repair capability does not exist at the scheduled en
          route stops, the PIC elects to have the item repaired prior to departing.
4.6. C-17 MEL. This MEL applies to all C-17 models and lists the minimum equipment and
systems to launch the aircraft under routine operations. The MEL is not applicable for
troubleshooting component failure(s) in flight. However, it may be used inflight to determine
aircraft status after recovery. The MEL does not include all equipment or systems essential to
airworthiness. The MEL is not intended to promote continued operation of the aircraft for an
indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative. See this chapter for further information
including objectives, policy, and waiver protocol. Additional guidance specific to SOLL
operations are listed in Addenda B, C-17 Special Operations.
4.7. Supplements. Each MAJCOM may supplement the MEL (see Chapter 1).
4.8. Navigation Systems. Equipment listed in FLIP for permitting compliance with MNPS is
mandatory. Loss of any component before airspace entry requires return to a station with
maintenance capability or re-filing via routes permitting equipment degradation.
4.9. Gear Down Flight Operations. Limit gear down flight operations to sorties required to
move the aircraft to a suitable repair facility. Consider gear down flight only after the PIC
exhausts all avenues to repair the aircraft in place.
   4.9.1. PICs shall not takeoff until there is reasonable assurance that they will
   achieve/maintain adequate obstacle clearance (to include en route stops and alternates).
   Reference ―Climbout Flight Path – 3 Engines Gear Down‖ charts in TO 1C-17A-1-1. PICs
   are reminded to also reference TO 1C-17A-1-1 for the appropriate drag index.
   4.9.2. Time and communications capability permitting, validate takeoff data with OG/OGV
   or MAJCOM STAN/EVAL.

                                            Chapter 5

                              OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. A checklist is not complete until all items have been accomplished.
Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions and deviations specified in the
flight manual, etc., are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures or limitations may be
added to the checklists. Currency of notes is a crewmember‘s responsibility.
   5.1.1. Checklist Inserts. MAJCOM/A3V and the AFMC Flight Manual Manager are the
   checklist insert approval authorities. Send checklist inserts to MAJCOM/A3V, who will in
   turn coordinate with AFMC for approval. All checklist inserts must have a POC. OGVs
   shall approve local in-flight guides and inserts not affecting T.O. guidance and procedures.
5.2. Duty Station. Both pilots shall be in their seats during flight. With both pilots in their
seats, PICs may authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying a primary duty station during non-
critical phases of flight (the other pilot will be awake and alert). All crewmembers will be at
their duty stations during all critical phases of flight, unless crew duties dictate otherwise. Due
to mission requirements, and at the discretion of the PIC, loadmasters may occupy a seat on the
flight deck or cargo compartment. During other phases of flight, crewmembers may leave their
duty stations, for brief periods, to meet physiological needs and perform normal crew duties
provided one pilot remains at a primary duty station during flight. Crewmembers will coordinate
with the PF before departing their assigned primary duty stations.
   5.2.1. Use of non-mission related material (watching movies, video games, music, PME,
   newspapers/magazines, performance reports, etc.) is prohibited by any crewmember at a
   primary duty position or acting as a primary crewmember.
5.3. Flight Station Entry. PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight
station during all phases of flight; the total number of persons permitted is limited to the number
of seats with operable seat belts and oxygen. Passengers and observers will not be permitted
access to the pilot, copilot, or loadmaster positions.
5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy. An aircraft commander, or above, will occupy either the left
or the right seat during all takeoffs and landings. The designated PIC (A-code) is not required to
occupy a primary position, but still retains overall authority for conduct of the mission.
   5.4.1. An AC or IP will make all takeoffs and landings during:
       5.4.1.1. Aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance.
       5.4.1.2. Emergency airlift of nuclear weapons (ENAO).
       5.4.1.3. Assault or substandard airfield operations.     EXCEPTION: Pilots receiving
       upgrade training or receiving an evaluation.
       5.4.1.4. Category II ILS approaches and landings when the weather is below Category I
       minimums.
   5.4.2. Not Used.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                    69


   5.4.3. Unless the other pilot in the seat is a certified AC or higher, pilots in command (PIC)
   with less than 100 primary assigned aircraft (PAA) hours since AC certification will make all
   takeoffs and landings under any of the following conditions:
       5.4.3.1. Ceiling/visibility less than 300 feet and/or RVR 4000 (3/4 SM visibility).
       5.4.3.2. RCR less than 12.
       5.4.3.3. Crosswind component greater than 15 knots.
   5.4.4. (Added-DOVERAFB) Descent, Approach and Landings in the AOR. FPQs will not
   conduct the descent, approach or landing into an airfield identified as a tactically required
   field by the AMC policy matrix, or airfields that are less than 100‘ wide. EXCEPTION:
   FPLs may conduct the descent, approach or landing into such airfields when under the direct
   supervision of an Instructor Pilot/Evaluator Pilot (IP/EP). FPQs may conduct the descent,
   approach or landing into such airfields if under the direct supervision of an IP/EP and with
   approval from home station/deployed SQ/CC or SQ/DO.
5.5. Landing Gear and Slat/Flap Operating Policy. The pilot flying (PF) will command
configuration changes. The pilot monitoring (PM) will verify appropriate airspeed and
configuration prior to echoing the gear or slat/flap actuation command. The landing gear will be
operated by the pilot in the right seat. The slats/flaps will be operated by the PM.
5.6. Outside Observer/Jump Seat Duties. Available crewmembers will assist in clearing
during taxi operations and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet MSL. Use available
crewmembers to assist in ensuring correct aircraft configuration for the selected phase of flight.
5.7. Seat Belts.
   5.7.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt. A crew bunk does not meet
   the requirement of a designated seat. Crewmembers will have seat belts fastened when
   occupying a duty position, unless crew duties dictate otherwise.
   5.7.2. Equipment will be properly secured and all crewmembers and passengers will be
   seated with seat belts and shoulder harnesses (shoulder harness does not apply to pax)
   fastened during taxi, takeoff, landing, AAR, and low levels unless crew duties dictate
   otherwise. The PIC may authorize passengers to observe AAR, but seat changes will be
   completed no closer than 100ft in trail. The PIC may authorize passenger movement via the
   aircraft Seat Belt sign. Crewmembers may remove the shoulder harness during non-critical
   phases of flight (i.e. cruise). Crewmembers performing instructor or flight examiner duties
   are exempt from seat belt requirements if not occupying a primary crew position; however,
   they will have a seat available with an operable seat belt.
   5.7.3. Litter patients, actual or simulated, must remain secured on litters for takeoff and
   landing.
5.8. Aircraft Lighting. IAW AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement
on the Ground, and applicable T.O.s.
   5.8.1. NVG Lighting.
       5.8.1.1. During combat/contingency operations, the tactical situation may dictate the use
       of all, some, or none of the aircraft exterior lights as determined by the mission
       commander. Lights-out operations during peacetime will be conducted in warning or
 70                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


       restricted areas IAW AFI 11-202V3 unless a letter of agreement exists with the FAA.
       Use the following guidance for aircraft exterior lighting configurations when operating
       outside of these areas.
       5.8.1.2. Navigation Lights: Steady, bright
       5.8.1.3. Formation Lights: On, medium (formation operations only). WARNING:
       Immediately discontinue use of NVGs, and/or increase spacing from preceding aircraft (if
       possible), when exterior lights in a preceding aircraft create excessive distractions or
       degrade performance of NVGs to the point where safe flying operations cannot be
       maintained.
       5.8.1.4. Anti-Collision Lights: On (upper and lower for single ship operations or for the
       last aircraft in the formation unless it causes distractions).
       5.8.1.5. Landing Lights. IR landing lights will be turned on no later than 400‘ AGL on
       final. NOTE: At least one aircraft in a formation will comply with single aircraft
       lighting restrictions.
   5.8.2. NVG Aircraft Preparation. The cockpit of the C-17A is specifically designed for NVG
   operations and little preparation is required for flights requiring NVGs. During the exterior
   walk around inspection, a pilot will ensure all wheel well inspection lights are turned off and
   necessary exterior IR lighting is installed.      NOTE: Mini-chemical lights or tape to
   mark/identify switches and equipment may be used as required.
5.9. Portable Electronic Devices. IAW AFI 11-202V3.
   5.9.1. Do not connect unauthorized equipment (laptop computers, video equipment, food
   preparation equipment, radios/tape players, CD players, etc.) to the aircraft intercom, PA,
   radio systems, or electrical system.
   5.9.2. Aircrew members shall not use uncertified Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)
   or personal devices with RF transmit/receive capability on AMC aircraft carrying hazard
   class 1 explosive cargo at anytime. Prohibited devices include cellular phones, and laptop
   computers/PDAs with wireless capability enabled (i.e. Bluetooth). Loadmasters will ensure
   passengers comply with this restriction. Aircrew members may use certified GFE such as
   PFPS laptops and PDAs with infrared transmitters.
   5.9.3. The following handheld (HH) GPS units meet the requirements of AFI 11-202V3 and
   may be used with approved laptop computers in flight: Bendix King KLX100 and Garmin
   GPS 35-USB.
       5.9.3.1. The use of HH GPS for moving map display (MMD) is designed as a situational
       awareness tool and its use is voluntary.
5.10. Tobacco Use on Air Force Aircraft. Tobacco use of any type is prohibited on Air Force
aircraft.
5.11. Advisory Calls. The PF will announce intentions for departures, arrivals, approaches, and
when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. The PM will make all advisory
calls except those designated for other crewmembers. NOTE: Automated aircraft advisories
satisfy this requirement.

 NOTES:
  (1) With weather at CAT I minimums on a CAT I ILS, the pilot may not see the runway
 environment at DA; however, the initial portion of the approach lights may be visible. The pilot
 may continue to 100 HAT with reference to the approach lights only. The pilot may not
 descend below 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as reference
 unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and identifiable.
 (2) The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue (Cat I), or go-around.
 Respond with the intention to land if runway environment is in sight, will remain in sight
 throughout touchdown and the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.
 (3) If the pilot flying has stated ―landing‖ then this call is not required.
 (4) On the approach, if the PF can maintain visual contact with the landing runway, and states
 ―Visual‖, subsequent instrument advisory calls are not required. Refer to stabilized approach
 criteria in paragraph 5.12.


   5.11.2. Deviations:
         5.11.2.1. Any crewmember will immediately notify the PF when deviation of heading
         (+/- 10 degrees), airspeed (+/-10 kts), or altitude (+/- 100 feet) is observed and no attempt
         is being made to correct the deviation.
         5.11.2.2. Any crewmember seeing a potential terrain or obstruction problem will
         immediately notify the PF.
5.12. Stabilized Approach. Unstable approaches are primary contributors to numerous military
and civilian mishaps. Stabilized approaches are essential for the safe operation of aircraft and
are mandatory. The following criteria define specific parameters that mitigate risk during this
critical phase of flight. This philosophy requires aircrew to take immediate corrective actions to
stabilize the approach when outside designated parameters.
   5.12.1. The following criteria apply to all approaches:
         5.12.1.1. At 1000 feet AGL:
            5.12.1.1.1. Aircraft is in approach configuration. Circling configuration is acceptable
            for circling approaches.
            5.12.1.1.2. Airspeed is appropriate for the configuration and conditions.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                   73


         5.12.1.1.3. Sink rate is no greater than 1000fpm. Note: Under certain conditions
         (WX, Threats, Terrain, etc.) some IAPs and tactical approaches may require greater
         than a 1000 fpm descent rate.
             5.12.1.1.3.1. Non-precision Approaches. Pilots should calculate a constant
             descent gradient profile from the FAF altitude to the VDP (IAW AFMAN 11-
             217V1). This is considered the safest profile and should be used to the max
             extent possible. During a go-around, ensure descent below the MDA does not
             occur.
         5.12.1.1.4. All briefings and checklists are complete unless contrary to T.O.
         guidance.
         5.12.1.1.5. Aircraft is on the correct track.
         5.12.1.1.6. Aircraft in the correct bank angle to maintain proper approach track for
         instrument, circling, or visual/tactical approach.
         5.12.1.1.7. Power set to maintain the descent profile at approach speed.
         5.12.1.1.8. If these criteria are not met by 1000 feet AGL, the PM will announce the
         deviation and the PF will take immediate corrective action. PM states ―1000 xxxx,‖
         where ―xxxx‖ equates to a concise description of the unstable characteristic(s) which
         clearly relay to the PF what actions are required to return the aircraft to a stable
         platform. Examples: ―1000, fast,‖ or ―1000, half dot low‖. If criteria are met, PM
         will simply state ―1000.‖
     5.12.1.2. If these criteria are not met by 500 feet AGL, the PM will announce the
     deviation using the ―xxxx‖ format and the PF will take immediate action. If criteria are
     met, PM will simply state ―500.‖
         5.12.1.2.1. Parameters are the same as those at 1000 feet AGL.
         5.12.1.2.2. If unstable at 500‘ crews should perform a go-around.
     5.12.1.3. From 300 AGL to the runway, if these parameters are exceeded the PM will
     announce ―Go-Around‖ and the PF will execute a go-around/missed approach. If criteria
     for stable approach are met, the PM will state ―300‖
         5.12.1.3.1. Momentary minor corrections or deviations are acceptable and defined as:
             5.12.1.3.1.1. Airspeed: +10/-5 kts from target
             5.12.1.3.1.2. Bank Angle: +/- 15 degrees from target
             5.12.1.3.1.3. Rate of Descent: +/- 300 FPM from target
  5.12.2. Descent Planning and Energy Management. Aircrews will ensure the aircraft is
  following the planned descent profile. All non-tactical descents should follow a normal
  descent profile IAW AFMAN 11-217 procedures and techniques in the absence of ATC or
  FLIP guidance. All tactical descents should follow published tactical procedures/profiles.
  When unforeseen interruptions alter the planned descent, immediately correct any deviations.
  It may be necessary to hold, request vectors, or take alternate actions in order to comply with
  the planned descent profile.
 74                                 AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   5.12.3. Visual Transition. It is imperative for aircrews to review the airfield environment.
   Identify key features such as approach light type, airfield lighting, geographic
   layout/configuration of runways, taxiways, ramps, etc. To the max extent possible, this study
   will take place during the crew mission briefing and reviewed again prior to descent.
   5.12.4. Missed Approach/Go-Around. Aircrews will conduct a thorough briefing for
   anticipated missed approach/go-around scenarios. This briefing will include a discussion of
   specific crewmember duties.
   5.12.5. Tactical Approaches. It is recognized the above criteria is not always valid due to
   the type of tactical approach required. In these situations (either real-world or training as
   briefed by Intel/Tactics or attained from other valid threat sources, e.g. GCI, AWACS,
   Tower, etc.) the PF is required to brief the maneuver parameters prior to execution, to include
   when to expect the aircraft to be stable and when to go around. If the threat is known prior to
   departure, the crew will accomplish briefing prior to departure during mission planning. If
   the threat arises during the sortie, the PIC will include the stability requirements as part of the
   arrival briefing.
   5.12.6. FTUs only. FTUs will train students to ensure they understand and are capable of
   complying with all aspects of stabilized approach criterion. FTU instructors must use their
   expertise and experience to deviate from the guidelines of stabilized approach criteria as
   required during appropriate instructional scenarios.
5.13. Communications Policy. The Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to
aircrews regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to
maintain a high degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
   5.13.1. Aircraft Interphone. Primary crewmembers will monitor interphone during critical
   phases of flight. Crewmembers will advise the PF before checking off interphone or
   operating in ISOLATE. Crewmembers will ensure personnel on headset, or within listening
   distance, are cleared prior to discussing classified information over interphone.
   5.13.2. Command Radios.
      5.13.2.1. The PM normally makes all air traffic control (ATC) radio calls.
      5.13.2.2. In terminal areas, all crewmembers (if able) will monitor the command radio
      unless directed otherwise. A crewmember will be designated to monitor C2 frequencies
      on the inbound and outbound legs.
      5.13.2.3. The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and
      update the crew when the primary radio changes.
      5.13.2.4. One pilot should record and will read back all ATC clearances.
      5.13.2.5. Both pilots will monitor UHF and VHF guard emergency frequencies to the
      maximum extent possible. EXCEPTION: Only one crewmember is required to monitor
      guard frequencies during rendezvous and AAR.
      5.13.2.6. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits the use of
      unauthorized frequencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK, or SECURE VOICE training.
   5.13.3. HF Communications. Confine message traffic to essential operational matters.
   Perform an HF radio ground check before takeoff if the use of HF radio may be required for
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                     75


   ATC or C2 communications. Establish HF contact before going out of UHF and VHF range.
   If unable to establish HF contact with the controlling HF station, and an alternate means of
   relay of ATC information in oceanic areas is not available, comply with FLIP.
      5.13.3.1. General. Provide ATC position and weather observations when required. If
      unable to contact an ATC agency, attempt relay through the GLOBAL HF stations.
   5.13.4. Use secure and jam resistant communications to the maximum extent possible. In a
   threat environment, limit radio transmissions with the objective area to those required for
   safety of flight or factors affecting force employment.
5.14. Crew Resource Management (CRM)/Threat and Error Management.
   5.14.1. Threat and Error Management provides strategies and tactics to help crews target
   threats to safe flight operations and decreases the potential for crew error. External threats
   are events that occur outside the influence of the flight crew and require crew attention and
   management to maintain adequate safety margins. Internal threats are crew related and are
   factors that could lead to an error if not recognized and controlled.
   5.14.2. "Time Out" is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers. The use
   of "Time Out" will:
      5.14.2.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness.
      5.14.2.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
      5.14.2.3. Notify all crewmembers when someone sees the aircraft or crew departing from
      established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply uncomfortable
      with the developing conditions.
      5.14.2.4. As soon as possible after a "Time Out" has been called, the aircrew will take
      the following actions:
      5.14.2.5. Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft and ensure terrain clearance.
      5.14.2.6. The initiating crewmember will voice their concerns to the crew.
      5.14.2.7. The PIC will provide all other crewmembers with the opportunity to voice
      inputs relative to the stated concerns.
      5.14.2.8. After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the aircrew to continue the
      current course of action or direct a new course of action.
      5.14.2.9. (Added-DOVERAFB) During the mission pre-brief, 436/512 AW pilots in
      command (PICs) will appoint an individual crewmember to assess crew resource
      management (CRM) during the sortie/mission.
      5.14.2.10. (Added-DOVERAFB) The PIC will conduct a formal debriefing following
      the completion of each mission and local training sortie in accordance with command
      guidance.
   5.14.3. Sterile Cockpit. With the exception of cruise flight, conversation below 18,000‘
   MSL will be limited to mission, departure, or approach essential items. Every effort will be
   made to accomplish briefings and appropriate checklists prior to top of descent (TOD).
   Sterile cockpit procedures also apply during taxi, low level, and air refueling operations.
 76                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   5.14.4. Heads-up/Heads-down. Any crewmember that observes both pilots heads-down at
   the same time (other than heads-down instrument flying) shall alert the PF without delay.
   5.14.5. CRM Enhancement. PICs will conduct a CRM exercise on the first suitable segment
   of each mission. This will be done at level off on a non interference basis with other mission
   requirements. Take the exercise to a logical conclusion and ensure crew communications
   and duties are appropriate. Suggested topics are rapid decompression, oceanic contingency
   operation, emergency divert or other MAJCOM or locally generated Special Interest Item
   (SII).
   5.14.6. Critical Action Coordination. Those actions that are flight critical/irreversible in
   nature and should always be confirmed by two crew members. These actions include, but are
   not limited to, pulling the engine fire handle, movement of the engine or APU start switch,
   discharging agent, or dumping fuel. Both pilots must verbally and visually identify the
   affected control, (i.e. ―CONFIRM NUMBER ONE‖). The pilot performing the action will
   point to the affected control. The pilot monitoring the action will verbally and visually
   confirm the proper control is selected, (i.e. ―NUMBER ONE CONFIRMED‖). The pilot
   performing the action then actuates the affected control.
5.15. Use of Automation.
   5.15.1. General Automation Procedures. There must be a clear understanding of the Pilot
   Flying (PF) and the Pilot Monitoring (PM) duties at all times. Aircrews are expected to fly
   the aircraft using the highest level of automation, balanced with the requirement to maintain
   basic flying skills. However, pilots are authorized to choose an appropriate level of
   automation consistent with changing flight environments. If the use of automation creates a
   loss of situational awareness or results in task saturation, shift to a less demanding level or
   disconnect the automation entirely and re-establish desired aircraft path and control. Both
   pilots are responsible for ensuring the aircraft is following the desired flight path.. The
   Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) and Mission Computer (MC) are intended to aid in
   workload management, not complicate it.
       5.15.1.1. One pilot should always remain heads up. Establish clear roles for computer
       related tasks. Announce ―pilot heads down‖ or ―copilot heads down‖ when the task
       requires focusing significant attention on the mission computer in flight.
       5.15.1.2. The pilot flying (PF) should make AFCS panel changes during coupled
       operations. During uncoupled flight, the PF should direct the pilot monitoring (PM) to
       make changes to the AFCS panel IAW paragraph 5.31. Confirm all mode changes by
       observing the correct flight mode annunciator (FMA) indications.
5.15.2. Verbalize, Verify, and Monitor (VVM) is a closed-loop system of communication
designed to significantly reduce typical automation selection errors between the PF and PM.
VVM consists of the following three step process:
       5.15.2.1. Prior to making any changes to the selected/armed Flight Guidance including
       Altitude, or performing any T.O. 1-C-17A-1 defined irreversible/critical action, the pilot
       performing the action will VERBALIZE the intended changes. The other pilot will
       acknowledge the step by stating ―Confirm.‖
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                    77


      5.15.2.2. Both pilots will VERIFY the intended changes prior to execution to include the
      correct mode is selected (e.g. ensure LNAV is selected when cleared to a point while on a
      heading).
      5.15.2.3. Both pilots will MONITOR the aircraft to ensure the expected performance is
      achieved.
      5.15.2.4. The PF will announce changes to the level of automation, flight director and
      autopilot mode selections, and mode transitions to the maximum extent possible (e.g.
      ―Autopilot engaged ‖,―Altitude Hold‖, ―Autothrottles‖, ―VOR-Capture‖, etc.).The PM
      will acknowledge the call. Use appropriate levels of automation as required by the flight
      conditions.
5.16. Transportation of Pets. Transporting pets (dogs and cats) in conjunction with the
sponsor‘s permanent change of station is authorized. Other pets or animals are normally
prohibited, but may be moved according to DoD 4515.13R.
5.17. Alcoholic Beverages. The MAJCOM/A3/DO or NAF/CC may authorize the dispensing
of alcoholic beverages.
5.18. Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements.
   5.18.1. Minimum Runway and Taxiway Requirements. Minimum runway width is 90
   feet/27.5 Meters. Minimum runway length is 3,500 feet. Minimum taxiway width is 50
   feet/15.5 Meters. Minimum width for Star Turn is 90 feet/27.5 Meters. MAJCOM/A3/DO
   may waive runway/taxiway width requirements.
   5.18.2. Runway Length for Takeoff and Landing. Do not takeoff if computed critical field
   length exceeds runway available. Minimum runway for a normal landing (3/4 or full flap) is
   computed landing distance with idle reverse. Minimum runway length for a full flap assault
   landing is computed ground roll, with max reverse, plus marked landing zone distance.
   (Marked landing zone distance is normally 500 feet) Touchdown will be within the marked
   landing zone. Weather minimums will be circling minimums, no lower than 600/2. Prior to
   landing at a short field, the PIC will verify takeoff performance to ensure he/she can take off
   after the planned offload/onload. NOTES: Max reverse is referenced on the Non-Standard
   Configuration page of the mission computer. The data computed with this option selected is
   based on 2 engines in max reverse, 1 in idle reverse and 1 engine inoperative. Pilots will
   also consider elevated brake temperatures and Vbo when determining the minimum runway
   required for landing to preclude melting the fuse plugs.
      5.18.2.1. Runway Length for Takeoff and Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, the PF will
      initiate takeoffs from the beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway. The
      decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC.
      5.18.2.2. Pilots may accomplish intersection takeoffs provided the operating
      environment (i.e., gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather, etc.) allows a safe
      takeoff and departure. Calculate takeoff performance based on the runway remaining
      from the point at which the takeoff is initiated.
      5.18.2.3. During operations on runways partially covered with snow or ice, base takeoff
      computations on the reported runway surface condition (RSC) or RCR for the cleared
      portion of the runway. A minimum of 45 feet either side of centerline should be cleared.
78                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


     If 45 feet either side of centerline is not cleared, compute takeoff data based on the
     uncleared portion up to 45 feet either side of centerline.
     5.18.2.4. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are available and stressed or
     authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for
     takeoff. Departure end overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing
     if needed.
     5.18.2.5. Markings required for assault landing zone (ALZ) operations are depicted in
     AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations. These markings are desirable for
     tactical airland operations; however, full markings are not mandatory on hard-surfaced
     runways that are permanently marked (or lighted) so as to make the touchdown zone and
     runway distances readily identifiable, or if the tactical situation does not permit full
     markings. Communication and navigation aids provided by special tactics units, are
     based on operational requirements, capability, and the specific threat environment.
  5.18.3. Arresting Cables.
     5.18.3.1. Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not include
     recessed cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower
     to have the cable inspected.
     5.18.3.2. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as
     slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, automated terminal information service
     (ATIS), or ATC.
     5.18.3.3. When conditions permit (aircraft gross weight, runway length, weather, winds,
     TOLD, etc.) and the pilot in command has considered the potential for damaging the
     aircraft, make takeoffs and landings beyond raised cable barriers. Use the entire length of
     runway if necessary. Be aware that operations over arresting gear barriers at speeds in
     excess of taxi speed may result in damage to the aircraft.
  5.18.4. Other Airfield Requirements.
     5.18.4.1. Consult with HQ AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) for suitability
     guidance. Airfield certification requirements are detailed in the ASRR.
     5.18.4.2. Aircrews and planning agencies will contact HQ AMC/A3AS for all questions
     pertaining to airfield weight bearing capacity and will review the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR
     before all off-station operations. HQ AMC/A3 is the waiver authority for the restrictions
     in GDSS/GDSS2 Giant Report and ASRR for AMC and AMC-gained aircraft, unless
     specifically delegated in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 3 or AMCI 11-208. Direct GDSS/GDSS2
     Giant Report and ASRR waiver requests to HQ AMC/A3AS. HQ AMC/A3V is the OPR
     for waivers to airfield restrictions. MAJCOM/A3/DO is the waiver authority for non-
     AMC missions. The PIC is responsible for waiver compliance. Crews that have access
     to the World Wide Web will review airfield suitability in the airfield data base via the HQ
     AMC Aircrew Portal. Consult the ASRR for airfield certification requirements.
     5.18.4.3. A current landing zone (LZ) survey (within the past five years as specified in
     AFI 13-217) is needed before using other than hard-surfaced runways or taxiways.
  5.18.5. RCR Limitations. When no RCR is available, the PIC will refer to GP for standard
  ICAO conversions based on general runway condition; be conservative when dealing with
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                    79


   unknown conditions (e.g., forward operating bases (FOBs), unpaved runways).Normally,
   RCR values are not reported for taxiways and ramps. During periods of reported low RCR,
   the taxiways and ramps may have an even lower RCR than reported for the runway. The
   runway surface should be considered wet when water on the runway causes a reflective glare.
   5.18.6. Semi-Prepared Runway Operations (SPRO). See TO 1C-17A-1-1 Appendix B.
   OG/CC approval is required for semi-prepared runway operations within the CONUS,
   Alaska, and Hawaii. MAJCOM/A3/DO approval is required in all other instances. For semi-
   prepared ALZs other than matted surfaces, Mission Commanders will ensure proper
   engineering evaluations (i.e. Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) or equivalent) are
   completed by qualified personnel within one week of the first landing to verify the LZ meets
   C-17 requirements.
      5.18.6.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) There are many considerations unique to semi-
      prepared runway operations, both in planning and operating. Aircrews will refer to TO
      1C-17A-1; TO 1C-17A-1-1 Appendix B, AFI 11-2C-17v3; AFI 13-217; AMCI 11-208;
      AFTTP 3-3 17, and other applicable command guidance regarding SPRO. Contact 436
      OSK or 512 OSK for additional information.
5.19. Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage
(FOD) Avoidance.
   5.19.1. The pilot will coordinate taxi directions and signals to be used with the loadmaster
   and marshaller (when available). Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions
   without wing walkers monitoring the clearance between aircraft and obstruction. With wing
   walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 10 feet. Wing walkers do not absolve the crew of
   their responsibility for obstruction clearance. For small permanent obstructions underneath
   the wing and tail, follow clearance criteria in Figure 5.1 During reverse taxi operations, do
   not taxi within 25 feet of an obstruction with or without a marshaller/wing walker.
   EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground,
   aircraft may taxi without marshalers/wing walkers at home station along fixed taxi lines
   which have been measured to ensure a minimum of 10 feet clearance from any obstruction
   and the obstruction is permanent. Adjacent aircraft are also considered a permanent
   obstruction, provided the aircraft is parked properly in its designated spot and is not moving.
   Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) and vehicles are considered a permanent obstruction,
   provided it is parked entirely within a designated area. Areas will be designated by
   permanent markings such as painted boxes or lines on the ramp or another suitable means.

Figure 5.1. Taxi Obstruction Diagram.




NOTES:
Permanent obstacles (i.e. fuel hydrants), 3 feet high or shorter, are not considered obstructions as
long as they remain a minimum of 10 feet away from the landing gear doors. A marshaller or
crew member will verify the height and location of 3', 5', and 8‘ high obstacles to ensure
specified clearances from the wing, engines, landing gear doors, and ramp toes or ramp.
   5.19.2. Stop the aircraft any time clearance is in question and deplane a crewmember to
   verify clearance and walk the wing, if necessary. If wing walkers are unavailable, deplane
   one or more crewmembers to maintain obstruction clearance and provide marshaling using
   AFI 11-218 signals. Use wing walkers, deplaned crewmembers, or a crewmember on
   interphone positioned at the paratroop door(s) or ramp to act as an observer while
   maneuvering on narrow taxiways. During night taxi operations, marshalers will have an
   illuminated wand in each hand. Wing walkers are only required to have one illuminated
   wand. Observers should be in a position to see wing walkers at all times (through door or
   windows) and communicate with the pilot.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                    81


     5.19.2.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) At Dover AFB, do not block-in without a marshaller to
     ensure the aircraft is parked in the correct position. EXCEPTION: A marshaller is not
     required for Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC) operations. The primary ERCC
     location is on taxiway A between taxiway B and D. The aircraft will face east abeam
     parking spot B3. The secondary ERCC location is on taxiway C between taxiway A and
     runway 14/32. The aircraft will face west. EXCEPTION: Crews may self block in when
     the duration of the lightning is greater than 30 minutes or will exceed their maximum
     flight duty period.
     5.19.2.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Do not taxi through Dover parking spots without prior
     coordination with the Dover Command Post and Dover Ground Control.
     5.19.2.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) Aircraft shall not taxi between spots Echo and Delta
     row when a K-loader is located in front of a 747 on Delta row. Adequate wing tip
     clearance cannot be achieved until the K-loader is moved. The solid white line in front of
     parking spot Delta provides 25 feet of C-17 wingtip clearance.
     5.19.2.4. (Added-DOVERAFB) Thrust Management. If a turn is required onto taxiway
     A from the main ramp, and the turn would produce jet blast on either spot E or D2, stop
     taxiing and coordinate with ATC/Command Post to have personnel secure themselves
     and their support equipment prior to resuming taxi.
  5.19.3. FOD Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD.
  Crews should:
     5.19.3.1. Carefully review airfield layout paying particular attention to taxi routes, turn
     requirements, and areas for potential FOD.
     5.19.3.2. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
     5.19.3.3. Where possible, avoid 180° turns. If required to accomplish a 180° turn on a
     narrow runway, the turn should be accomplished at an intersection of a link taxiway or at
     a designated turn around pad.
     5.19.3.4. Where possible, avoid taxi operations that position an engine over an
     unprepared or un-swept surface. If unavoidable, leave the engine in idle (to the
     maximum extent possible) until the engine is over an improved surface.
  5.19.4. Reverse Taxi:
     5.19.4.1. The pilot will coordinate reverse taxi directions and signals to be used with the
     loadmaster and marshaller (when available). CAUTION: During the entire reverse taxi
     operation, if the loadmaster states the word ―Stop,‖ the pilot will immediately stop the
     aircraft. Failure to comply may result in damage to aircraft or injury to personnel.
     5.19.4.2. Ensure all passengers are seated with seatbelts fastened and cargo is secure.
     5.19.4.3. The loadmaster must have enough maneuverability to observe and direct
     reverse taxi, and report any hazards. The loadmaster will provide the pilot with
     continuous interphone instructions on conditions in the maneuvering area. This includes
     turns, distance remaining (for wingtips, empennage, and main gear), and stopping point.
     During aircraft backing, if the pilot and loadmaster lose interphone contact the pilot will
     stop the aircraft.
 82                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


      5.19.4.4. When reverse taxiing at night, the pilots and loadmaster will ensure the taxi
      area is sufficiently lighted. Use the staging lights, retracted landing lights, or any other
      source that provides adequate lighting of the taxi area.
      5.19.4.5. During reverse taxi operations, stop at least 25 feet from an obstruction with or
      without a marshaller/wing walker. CAUTION: The aircraft tail cannot be seen by the
      loadmaster from inside the aircraft and could possibly strike an obstruction well before
      the main gear tires are near the ramp edge. If any doubt exists as to sufficient clearance,
      stop the aircraft.
5.20. Fuel Jettison Procedures.
   5.20.1. Aircrews should consider burning down fuel versus jettison, unless safety of flight
   dictates an immediate jettison (as determined by the pilot in command). Except in the case
   of an emergency, before jettisoning fuel, notify the appropriate ATC or flight service facility
   of intentions, altitude, and location. If available, the PIC will use designated jettison areas,
   except when safety of flight would be compromised.
   5.20.2. For missions tasked by higher headquarters authority, the tasking C2 agency may
   authorize fuel jettison when an urgent operational requirement dictates immediate
   recovery/reconstitution of the aircraft and/or aircrew. The tasking C2 agency may provide
   fuel jettison instructions in the OPORD, mission directive, SPINS, etc.
   5.20.3. For training missions, the OG/CC may approve fuel jettison when an urgent
   operational requirement exists to expedite recovery of the aircraft and all alternatives have
   been exhausted.
   5.20.4. OG/CCs will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel
   jettisoning. Ideally, establish jettison areas , off published airways, avoiding urban areas,
   agricultural regions, and water supply sources. Avoid circling descents. Initiate AF Form
   813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, and submit it to the base environmental
   coordinator.
      5.20.4.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) The VFR airborne fuel dump area is located to the east
      of Dover over the Delaware Bay at 7,000 feet. Based on the intentions of the pilot, this
      area shall be used to the maximum extent possible for all fuel dumping in the Dover
      Radar Approach area, except when the delay incurred going to the area or altitude would
      compromise flying safety. Higher altitudes are coordinated with ATC Center control as
      needed. The IFR jettison area is located in Warning Area W-107. The RAPCON will
      obtain clearance from Washington Center when an aircraft requests IFR clearance into
      this area. Reference DAFB 13-201 for additional information.
   5.20.5. All jettisons will be followed up with a detailed report filed by the PIC immediately
   after landing using a MAJCOM approved form for unusual occurrence or inflight emergency.
   Submit completed form through unit OGV to MAJCOM/Stan Eval. Unit OGVs will retain
   forms for 6 months. Document all pertinent information, including the following items:
      5.20.5.1. Scheduled Duration.
      5.20.5.2. Actual Duration.
      5.20.5.3. Landing Gross Weight.

      5.20.5.12. Approval Authority.
5.21. Aircraft Speed. IAW AFI11-202V3. In accordance with applicable tech orders, aircraft
may exceed 250 KIAS or in-flight minimum maneuver speed below 10,000 feet to safely
maintain formation position. All formation members may exceed 250 KIAS below 10,000 feet to
accommodate the minimum maneuver speed of the heaviest formation member.
5.22. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are
centralized unit efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
consolidated course of action. As a minimum, unit commanders must implement the following
procedures:
   5.22.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions.
      5.22.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions.
      5.22.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate - Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed
      only when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local IFR/VFR traffic
      pattern activity is prohibited.
      5.22.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe - All takeoffs and landings are prohibited.
      Waiver authority is local OG/CC or equivalent. Parent MAJCOM/A3/DO waiver is
      required to operate at airfields not controlled by the MAF.
      5.22.1.4. (Added-DOVERAFB) Dover AFB Tower issues the Bird Watch Condition
      (BWC). Dover AFB is unique and determines a BWC for each runway. At Dover, it is
      possible for one runway to be Moderate or Severe, while the other runway is Low.
   5.22.2. Commanders establish Phase II of the BASH program during increased periods of
   migratory bird activity. Schedulers shall make every effort to not schedule takeoffs,
   landings, and low-levels from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the
   Phase II period. Publish significant bird hazards in FLIP Area Planning (AP) and the IFR
   Supplement along with the associated airfield operating hour restrictions and avoidance
   instructions.
      5.22.2.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Phase I. Migratory bird activity is low, normally
      between April and September. During Phase I crews will adhere to the following bird
      watch condition restrictions:
          5.22.2.1.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Operational Missions.            Crews will adhere to
          guidance in paragraph 5.22.1.
84                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


         5.22.2.1.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Local Training Missions. Crews will adhere to
         guidance in paragraph 5.22.1.
         5.22.2.1.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) Off-Station Training Missions.                Crews will
         adhere to guidance in paragraph 5.22.1.
     5.22.2.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Phase II. Migratory bird activity is high; normally
     between October and March. During Phase II crews will adhere to the following bird
     watch condition restrictions:
         5.22.2.2.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Operational Missions.              Crews will adhere to
         guidance in paragraph 5.22.1.
         5.22.2.2.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Local Training Missions. Crews will adhere to
         guidance in paragraph 5.22.1.
         5.22.2.2.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) Off-Station Training Missions.                Crews will
         adhere to guidance in paragraph 5.22.1.
     5.22.2.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) Phase II Peak Bird Hours. Based on observation data
     at Dover, flying hours are restricted from ½ hour before sunrise and sunset to 1 ½ hours
     after sunrise and sunset. During Phase II and within the Phase II peak bird hours crews
     will adhere to the following bird watch condition restrictions:
         5.22.2.3.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Operational Missions.              Crews will adhere to
         guidance in paragraph 5.22.1.
         5.22.2.3.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Local Training Missions. Crews will not depart
         or land without 436 OG/CC approval.
         5.22.2.3.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) Off-Station Training Missions. Crews will not
         depart or land without 436 OG/CC approval.
     5.22.2.4. (Added-DOVERAFB) Night practice circling approaches during BASH
     Phase II.
         5.22.2.4.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) During Phase II, night practice circling
         approaches in the northeast quadrant (area between runway 19 and 32) and the
         TACAN RWY 19 approach will be restricted to a minimum descent altitude (MDA)
         of 900 ft mean sea level (MSL) and a required ceiling of 1500 feet AGL until
         departing from the MDA.
         5.22.2.4.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Standard minimums apply during day operations
         of Phase II, when circling in any other quadrant during Phase II, and in all quadrants
         during Phase I both day and night.
  5.22.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, a PIC has the authority
  to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition after coordinating with the appropriate C2
  authority.
     5.22.3.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Unless otherwise published, assume peak bird hours at
     other AMC bases and low level routes to be 1 hour before sunrise and sunset to 1 hour
     after sunrise and sunset. If you have questions concerning peak bird activity or hours,
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                     85


     contact the specific base Airfield Operations or Wing Safety Office for an immediate
     update.
  5.22.4. Consider bird migratory patterns during the en route portion of the mission to help
  minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on HQ
  AFSC/SEF website contains BASH information including regionalized Continental United
  States (CONUS) bird migration patterns, Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) software
  overlay, and the latest news. The Avian Hazard Advisory system (AHAS) website is another
  source for real time bird hazard information. Both sites may be accessed through the AMC
  aircrew mission planning portal. See AFPAM 91-212, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
  Management Techniques, for additional information.
  5.22.5. Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit, or as
  practicable, to have the aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. Bird strike
  damage cannot be accurately assessed in-flight, and undetected damage may result in a
  complex airborne emergency; only qualified maintenance personnel, on the ground, can
  make reliable damage assessments.
     5.22.5.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) If a bird strike is suspected, notify ATC and Command
     Post. Enter all suspected or confirmed bird strikes in the aircraft 781s and fill out an AF
     Form 853 and AMC Form 97. These forms will be sent to home station wing safety via
     command post as soon as practical. Any aircraft experiencing a bird strike in the local
     area will terminate training and land as soon as practical to have maintenance inspect the
     aircraft. The training sortie may be continued at the PIC‘s discretion when maintenance
     determines the aircraft is airworthy. If a bird strike occurs outside the local area, consider
     using a closer qualified maintenance facility. EXCEPTION: At the discretion of the
     PIC, the aircraft may abandon the planned off-station training and return to Dover AFB
     for one approach to a full stop landing. No further training will be attempted prior to
     inspecting the aircraft for damage. If a full stop is conducted off station, the aircrew will
     contact Command Post for coordination with the OG/CC and relay the extent of damage.
     The OG/CC, PIC, and maintenance supervisor will determine appropriate actions.
     5.22.5.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) If practical, collect remains from all bird strikes. Turn
     in remains to the local Wing Safety, Airfield Operations or MX Quality Assurance.
  5.22.6. (Added-DOVERAFB) Aircrew mission planning guidance (Phase I and Phase II).
     5.22.6.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Prior to conducting transition work at airfields without
     a BASH program, planner/aircrews will obtain any available bird activity information
     prior to and during operations at the airfield. Upon arrival at the airfield, the PIC must
     recheck the condition by any means possible. Aircrews experiencing high bird activity at
     these locations will advise the controllers of the bird activity so they can announce this
     information to other aircrews and update the ATIS if necessary. After the mission,
     aircrews should notify their respective safety office BASH representative concerning any
     high bird activity.
     5.22.6.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Regardless of Phase I or Phase II operations, all low
     levels and military transition airfields will be assessed by the Avian Hazard Avoidance
     system (AHAS) prior to mission execution. AHAS should be used in mission planning to
     select a training location that will allow for safe mission execution. In an effort to reduce
 86                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


       the bird strike hazard along low-level routes, crews will observe the following restrictions
       on training missions:
          5.22.6.2.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Transition training procedures. Crews will check
          AHAS for planned military transition airfields. If any proposed training airfield is
          AHAS Moderate or Severe, the crew may proceed to that location and obtain the
          airfield‘s updated/real-time bird condition. If the actual bird condition is Low, the
          crew may continue training.
          5.22.6.2.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) AHAS Bird Condition LOW: No low level or
          transition restrictions.
          5.22.6.2.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) AHAS Bird Condition MODERATE:                        Crews
          will fly no faster than 250 knots on affected route segments.
          5.22.6.2.4. (Added-DOVERAFB) AHAS Bird Condition SEVERE: The PIC will
          obtain OG/CC approval prior to commencing any flight on affected low level route
          segments. Once OG/CC approval is granted, crews will fly no faster than 250 knots
          and no lower than 1000 feet AGL (3000 feet AGL at night) on affected route
          segments.
   5.22.7. (Added-DOVERAFB) For information on Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH), see
   Dover AFBI 91-212, Dover AFB Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program, 26 January
   2007.
5.23. Functional Check Flights (FCFs), Acceptance Check Flights (ACFs) and Operational
Check Flights (OCFs). Check flights will be accomplished IAW T.O. 1C-17A-6, AFI 21-101,
Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, T.O. 1-1-300, Functional Check Flights and
Maintenance Operational Checks, and T.O. 1C-17A-6CF-1, Acceptance and/or Functional
Check Procedures Manual. Crews should only perform tasks or functions contained in specific
technical order guidance. If requested to perform a non-standard function, PICs should contact
their OG/CC to see if an FCF applies.
   5.23.1. FCF Restrictions. See T.O. 1-1-300 and AFI 21-101.
   5.23.2. The OG/CC, or deployed equivalent, may authorize temporary waivers to FCF
   procedures for aircrew qualification when operationally necessary. Permanent waivers
   require MAJCOM/A3/DO approval IAW Chapter 1.
   5.23.3. The OG/CC is responsible for the wing FCF program. Publish additional guidance
   in local supplement to this instruction. The OG/CC may authorize a partial FCF to check
   only those systems disturbed by maintenance, an inspection or modification.
   5.23.4. Conduct check flights within the designated check flight airspace of the base from
   which the flight was launched except when the flight must be conducted under specific
   conditions, not compatible with local conditions and area restrictions.
   5.23.5. The decision to approve a combined FCF and ferry flight is the responsibility of the
   MAJCOM/A3/DO.
   5.23.6. The OG/CC will only certify highly experienced instructors as FCF crewmembers.
   The OG/CC will determine FCF crew complement after a thorough ORM assessment for that
   specific FCF flight.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                       87


   5.23.7. Ideally, conduct FCFs in daylight, VMC. OG/CCs may authorize a flight under a
   combination of VMC and IMC. Begin the flight in VMC. If the aircraft and all systems are
   operating properly, the crew may proceed IFR through cloud cover to ―VFR on Top‖ for the
   altitude phase of the flight.
   5.23.8. If a malfunction occurs during a FCF, the MXG/CC may subsequently release the
   aircraft for flight providing the malfunction is not related to the condition generating the
   FCF, and the original condition operationally checked good.
   5.23.9. The OG/CC or deployed MC may authorize temporary waivers to FCF procedures
   for aircrew qualification when operationally necessary. Permanent waivers require
   MAJCOM/A3/DO approval IAW Chapter 1.
5.24. Participation in Aerial Events. See AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures,
and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
   5.24.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) 436 OSS/OSO or 512 OSF/OSO is the OPR for
   coordination of air shows/flyovers and aerial demonstrations with the user(s) and higher
   headquarters. Aircrews participating in these events will work closely with the mission
   scheduler. Aircraft commanders will receive a briefing from current operations on event
   requirements.
   5.24.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Aircrews will comply and be familiar with the current MAF
   Aerial Demonstration CONOPS and AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures, 04
   May 2006. The Aircraft Commander must brief OG/CC prior to departing for an aerial
   demonstration.
5.25. Traffic Alerting and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). It is imperative to follow
resolution advisories (RAs) to obtain aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to follow
the computed RA may increase the probability of a midair collision. Pilots who deviate from an
ATC clearance in response to an RA shall notify ATC of the deviation as soon as practical and
promptly return to the ATC clearance when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new
clearance.
   5.25.1. Refer to T.O. 1C-17A-1 for TCAS Traffic Alert and Warning procedures.
       5.25.1.1. PM will confirm the action being performed by the PF. Advise the PF of any
       deviation from the vertical path indicated by flight director guidance, the TCAS PPI
       display, and/or other annunciations.
   5.25.2. Multi-ship formation.
5.25.2.1. Lead aircraft (or designated alternates) will operate TCAS in the ―TA only‖ mode.
Consideration should be given to having the last aircraft in multi-element formations operating
TCAS in ―TA only‖ mode.
       5.25.2.2. For formations utilizing SKE and TCAS overlay to verify formation position,
       all aircraft will operate TCAS in accordance with TO 1C-17A-1.
   5.25.3. Low-level operations. This system was not designed for use in the low level
   environment, but could provide valuable awareness of light aircraft or other military aircraft
   using military airspace.
 88                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   5.25.4. Air refueling operations. TCAS may be used to help acquire and track the tanker(s)
   during the rendezvous. Use ―TA only‖ mode inside the RVIP and be aware TCAS will be
   unavailable once the IFF is set to STBY.
   5.25.5. Additional information.
       5.25.5.1. If a GPWS or stall warning occurs, terminate the RA maneuver.
       5.25.5.2. Per MNPS Manual, FAA Advisory Circular AC 120-55B, excessive climb and
       descent rates in excess of 1500fpm when approaching level-off altitude could lead to
       inadvertent TA/RA warnings.
   5.25.6. TCAS event documentation. The PIC will document all pertinent information
   surrounding an RA event on the AF IMT 657 HATR, and submit the report to the nearest air
   force safety office.
5.26. Radar Altimeter.
   5.26.1. Any crewmember detecting the ―TOO LOW‖ annunciation (PFD/HUD) will
   immediately notify the PF. Terrain clearance and aircraft position must be verified.
5.27. Buddy Starts. Buddy starts may be performed when approved by MAJCOM A3/DO or
equivalent (OG/CC for local training missions). This is a one-time authorization and will not be
construed to allow repeated buddy starts at various scheduled en route stops.
5.28. Bank Angles. Do not exceed bank angles greater than 45 degrees (except MAJCOM-
approved tactics maneuvers).
5.29. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews should not attempt to recover
an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi; ground crews
will accomplish aircraft recovery. Unless an emergency dictates otherwise, aircrews may only
accomplish recovery if there is no aircraft damage, the surface will support the aircraft, and the
PIC has coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM headquarters maintenance authorities through
618 AOC (TACC), or appropriate C2 agency.
5.30. Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) / Terrain Alert Warning System
(TAWS). During GPWS/TAWS WARNINGS, apply the escape maneuver IAW TO 1C-17A-1
during: Day VMC operations without terrain/obstacle clearly in sight, Night VMC, or IMC.
WARNING: Do not delay pull-up for diagnosis of the low altitude WARNINGS. Failure to roll
wings level during the maneuver described above will decrease stall margin at heavy aircraft
gross weights. NOTE: Reference TO 1C-17A-1 for detailed descriptions of GPWS/TAWS
WARNINGS, CAUTIONS, and Advisories
   5.30.1. Exceptions to this policy are addressed in the GDSS Giant Report and ASRR for
   specific airfields. The PIC may only disregard GPWS/TAWS warnings at night or in IMC if
   all the following conditions are met:
       5.30.1.1. The airfield has a known GPWS/TAWS anomaly as listed in the GDSS Giant
       Report and ASRR.
       5.30.1.2. The warning occurs inside the FAF.
       5.30.1.3. A plan of action is briefed to the crew prior to commencing the approach.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                   89


       5.30.1.4. Either the aircraft is at or above the ILS glideslope or MDA on a Localizer
       approach with both PLSRs being monitored, or the runway is in sight with the aircraft at
       or above the glideslope as determined by the VASI, PAPI, or similar device.
       WARNING: If any of these conditions are not met execute the escape maneuver.
   5.30.2. Ensure the mode of the GPWS/TAWS is commensurate with the aircraft‘s phase of
   flight.
   5.30.3. Aircrews will annotate all TAWS and GPWS alerts deemed to be nuisance warnings
   in the aircraft forms (AFTO 781). Write-ups must include type of alert (TAWS/GPWS),
   aural warning received, location, and time of incident. Maintenance, in turn, will forward the
   event data IAW the deficiency report procedures through appropriate command channels. In
   addition, crews will annotate nuisance warning information on the TAWS/GPWS nuisance
   event worksheet (AMC/A3V website) and forward to their unit OGV office via scan, e-mail,
   or fax.
5.31. Standard AFCS Terminology. Under certain conditions, complete commands may be
required. This would require an action, the proper axis, then the setting, e.g., ―SELECT
HEADING 060.‖
   5.31.1. SELECT or ENGAGE directs the selection of a value on the AFCS panel which
   results in the value being placed in the ―Engaged‖ (Top) portion of the FMA. SELECT is
   normally used with rotary knobs labeled ―SEL,‖ however, ENGAGE is acceptable. The FD,
   TOGA, APPR, ATT, AD, AP, AT are normally engaged. For added clarification, selecting
   an EPR rating means pressing a thrust rating button on the SED panel; engaging EPR means
   pressing the AFCS ―EPR‖ pushbutton.
       5.31.1.1. For ATC assigned altitudes, one pilot will select and arm the assigned altitude
       in the ALT window. Both pilots will confirm the altitude in the ALT window is correct.
   5.31.2. ARM directs the selection of a value on the AFCS panel which results in the value
   being placed in the ―Armed‖ (Bottom) portion of an FMA.
   5.31.3. For LNAV and VNAV selections, command the actual value intended, not ―ARM
   LNAV‖ or ―ENGAGE VNAV.‖ For example, ―ARM VOR‖ or ―ENGAGE VPROF‖ are
   proper commands.
   5.31.4. Standard terminology is very precise, but can unnecessarily congest cockpit
   communication. In-flight context generally allows simplified direction and execution. For
   example ―ARM 10,000‖ is obviously an altitude command and does not require the noun
   ―altitude‖ to clearly communicate the PF‘s desires. Airspeeds appended with ―PITCH‖ or
   ―THRUST‖ are sufficiently clear and do not require the use of the noun ―speed.‖ VERT
   SPDS appended with ―UP‖ or ―DN‖ are sufficiently clear. If requested by the PF, ATC
   vectors (headings) may be automatically selected, and altitudes automatically armed by the
   PM. At any time the PM is unsure of the command, he/she will ask for clarification. If the
   PF sees an uncommanded FMA, he/she will clearly restate the command and ensure the
   actual value is made.
5.32. C-17 HUD/MFD Endorsement. The C-17 MFD is certified as a single medium display,
and may be used as a primary flight reference (PFR). Due to the lack of a full-time attitude
reference, the heads up display (HUD) is endorsed as a PFR as long as one primary flight display
 90                                 AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


is present on an MFD. To the maximum extent possible, keep a primary flight display (PFD) on
one of the MFDs at all times. When mission requirements dictate, the PFD may be replaced with
another display for short periods of time.
5.33. C-17 Engine Start Policy. If available, maintenance personnel should act as ―ground‖
during engine starts. Any C-17 crewmember may also fulfill this requirement. If no maintenance
personnel are available and crew duties limit the availability of a crewmember, the engines may
be started without someone outside the aircraft. If this option is used, ensure all crewmembers
are thoroughly briefed.
5.34. (Added-DOVERAFB) PFPS computers. Additional PFPS computers are available for
check-out to aircrew. Kits include laptop computer, printer, and miscellaneous equipment for
autonomous mission planning. Contact 436 OSS/OSK NLT 72 hours prior to mission departure
to check out a kit. Laptops will be transferred and accounted for by using AF Form 1297,
Temporary Issue Receipt, 01 July 1987.
   5.34.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Upon arrival at en route stations, the kit and its equipment
   should be appropriately secured.
   5.34.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) The configuration of the laptops shall not be changed. No
   programs will be added to or deleted from the original configuration.
5.35. (Added-DOVERAFB) Aircraft cleanliness.
   5.35.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Prior to departing the aircraft, all members of the crew will
   ensure the galley, crew rest, and the flight deck are clear of trash, and all unused equipment is
   stowed. The aircraft commander will ensure all mission critical information is accounted for.
   The loadmaster will ensure the cargo compartment is clear of trash and all unused equipment
   is stowed. At stations without fleet service, the PIC will ensure trash is removed from the
   aircraft as needed. If the aircraft configuration is unknown for the next sortie, the aircraft
   should be left in a C2 configuration with side wall seats stowed, life vest/EPOS stowed in
   seats, and pillows/blankets folded.
5.36. (Added-DOVERAFB) Aircrew Procedures for Lightning Within 5 NM Conditions:
   5.36.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) The following procedures will be adhered to by all aircrew
   members when a lightning within 5 miles condition is announced by the base weather agency
   or tower.
       5.36.1.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) If aircraft engines are running, all crewmembers will
       remain on the aircraft.
       5.36.1.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) If the aircraft is not currently in an approved parking
       spot, the crew may continue to parking, but will hold just prior to the assigned spot. The
       crew will not enter the spot until after the lightning hold is lifted and wing walkers are in
       place. EXCEPTION: Crews may self block in when the duration of the lightning is
       greater than 30 minutes or will exceed their maximum flight duty period.
   5.36.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) If aircraft engines are not running, all external preflight and
   loading operations will immediately cease. All crewmembers outside the aircraft will either
   vacate the flight line to a building or seek cover inside the aircraft. Once the lightning hold is
   lifted, the crew may resume normal operations.

       LAIRCM IAW the CONEMP for all OCONUS mission segments.
       6.3.10.4. Aircrew should utilize the LAIRCM on local tactical training missions.
       6.3.10.5. The UDM card will be stored in the secure stowage facility (gun box) on board
       the aircraft anytime the LAIRCM system is not in use.
           6.3.10.5.1. Each LAIRCM aircraft will have a certified combo lock on its gun box,
           provided by the aircraft‘s home unit.
       6.3.10.6. A SF 702 (security container check sheet) will be annotated by each aircrew
       upon opening and closing the gun box.
       6.3.10.7. The PIC is responsible for ensuring the UDM card is in the gun box prior to the
       flight, and before leaving the aircraft at the end of the duty day.
           6.3.10.7.1. If the UDM card is missing, notify appropriate C2 agency.
6.4. Aircrew Publications Requirements. Primary crewmembers will carry (or have in-flight
access to) the publications specified in Table 6.1 on all missions. ―P‖ designates the publication

is required to be carried in paper format. ―D‖ designates the publication may be carried in either
paper or digital format. If publications are carried in a digital format, the unit will provide the
media to view the digital publications. The unit may specify additional publications in their unit
supplement to this instruction. Reference AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program, for
guidance on electronic publications.
   6.4.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Crews are required to carry electronic publications (ePubs),
   Consolidated Trip Kit (CTK), and other electronic media in accordance with AMC/A3V
   guidance. The CTK contains all of the publications required in Table 6.1 except for
   individual crew member checklists. The list of required aircrew required carry checklists and
   inserts are located within the Flight Crew Bulletin. Pilots are required to carry the 436 OG
   OI 11-10 on local training missions. The PIC, or designated representative, will ensure the
   CTK is inventoried and on board the aircraft.

6.5. Airfield Review. Aircrews will consult the web-based airfield database maintained by HQ
AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) and comply with the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR for updates
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                     95


to airfield operability and weight bearing capability. Refer to AFI 11-202V3 Chapter 8 for non-
DoD published approach criteria. As a minimum, airfield review will include:
   6.5.1. Airspace/Airfield Review. FLIP, FIR/UIR/ADIZ procedures.
   6.5.2. Airspace classifications, GDSS/ ASRR, and Giant Report.
   6.5.3. Special Pilot in Command (SPIC) airport review.
6.6. Aircrew Intelligence Briefing. Aircrews will receive an intelligence briefing that will
emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and military development in the area in which
they will be flying. Obtain timely intelligence updates prior to entering a specific area of
operations (AOR). In theater, aircrews should receive intelligence updates on initial arrival at a
forward operating location (FOL), or en route stop, and thereafter when significant developments
occur. Report information of possible intelligence value to the local intelligence office as soon
as practical to ensure timely dissemination of mission reports (MISREPs).
   6.6.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) PICs or designated representatives will coordinate pre-
   departure briefs at least one day prior to entering crew rest.

6.12. Briefing Requirements.
   6.12.1. Pre-Departure Briefing Items. The PIC and controlling agency jointly share
   responsibility to identify special briefing requirements. The PIC will contact the local C2
   agency to confirm mission support requirements.
   6.12.2. Pilot in Command Briefing. Cover all applicable items of the mission briefing guide,
   including MAJCOM, NAF, unit special interest items (SIIs), CRM, ORM levels, taxi brief
   with ground crew and mitigating factors. Brief crewmembers on the specific mission details
   if not previously accomplished. Use a MAJCOM approved briefing guide. Reference
   AFTTP 3-3.C-17 for additional briefing information.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                     99


     6.12.2.1. In the en route system, the PIC will ensure that an aircrew briefing is conducted
     prior to the first sortie of the day. As a minimum, brief crewmembers on specific mission
     details for that day's sortie(s), CRM, and the ORM level and mitigating factors for the
     mission. Complete this briefing prior to engine start.
     6.12.2.2. NVG Briefing Requirements. Refer to MAJCOM Approved Briefing Guide
     and AFTTP 3-3.C-17 for expanded techniques.
     6.12.2.3. Departure/Arrival Briefings. The PF will reference the departure/arrival
     briefings of MAJCOM approved Mission Briefing Guide to verify all applicable items
     have been briefed prior to calling the brief complete.
         6.12.2.3.1. The departure brief will be accomplished when called for in the aircrew
         checklist. The PF will brief all applicable items of the departure brief. For multiple
         takeoffs and departures at the same airfield, PF is only required to brief items that
         changed from the previous brief.
         6.12.2.3.2. The arrival brief will be completed prior to the start of descent. For local
         transition training, complete the arrival brief as soon as possible after departure but no
         later than configuring for the approach. The PF will brief all applicable items of the
         arrival brief. If planning a visual approach, the PF will brief a suitable backup
         instrument approach if available. For multiple approaches and/or landings at the
         same airfield, PF is only required to brief items that changed from the previous brief.
  6.12.3. Specialized Briefing. Use specialized briefings to detail operating procedures or SIIs
  peculiar to various crew positions, and to answer questions relating to those specialties.
  6.12.4. Weather Briefings. The PIC will obtain a briefing on current weather, trends, and
  forecast for the proposed route, destination, and alternates. The PIC will brief primary
  crewmembers on appropriate weather conditions before departure.
     6.12.4.1. Aircrews flying flight-managed sorties will use the weather briefing provided
     with the IFM aircrew departure papers. Local weather flights/agencies may update local
     takeoff weather data, but aircrews, working through their flight manager/dispatcher, will
     use 618 AOC (TACC) weather operations (or the Operational Weather Squadron (OWS)
     supporting the theater C2 Agency) as the final arbiter for weather-related issues and
     further updates.
     6.12.4.2. On sorties not planned by a flight manager, crews should obtain weather
     information from their local weather flight or the OWS responsible for weather support at
     their location.
     6.12.4.3. If adequate services are not available, and the crew cannot contact their home
     weather flight, OWS, or 618 AOC (TACC) weather operations, obtain weather through
     any means available prior to mission accomplishment.
         6.12.4.3.1. Weather information is permitted from US Military weather services, any
         FAA-approved weather source, or any host nation civil or military weather source.
     6.12.4.4. Local Training Flights. Verbal weather briefings are authorized.
 100                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   6.12.5. Buffer Zone. Prior to operating an aircraft within, or adjacent to, an established
   buffer zone, the PIC will ensure primary crewmembers are briefed on current buffer zone
   procedures outlined in appropriate directives.
   6.12.6. Peacetime and Wartime SAFE PASSAGE Procedures. Pilots must be familiar with
   peacetime and wartime safe passage of friendly military aircraft.
   6.12.7. IFM Briefing. PICs will thoroughly review the aircrew departure papers provided
   for IFM sorties. When time and circumstances permit, the PIC, or designated representative,
   will contact the flight manager before signing the flight plan.
   6.12.8. Training/Evaluation Briefing.         Before all training/evaluation missions,
   instructors/flight examiners will brief the crew on requirements and objectives for each
   student or examinee.
6.13. Call Signs.
   6.13.1. Training Missions. Aircraft will use the unit static call sign prefix followed by a 2-
   digit suffix assigned by the parent unit.
       6.13.1.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Dover AFB unit static call sign prefixes are identified
       in the Wing Operations Policy Summary and GDSS 2. The 436th OG aircrews will use
       the static call sign of ―ROYAL‖. 512th OG aircrews will use the static call sign of
       ―RIDER‖.
   6.13.2. Operational Missions. Use call signs assigned by OPORD, FRAG, or diplomatic
   clearance. If no call sign has been assigned, use unit static call signs. When flying AMC
   missions, and no other call sign has been assigned, use the ―REACH‖ call sign followed by
   the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft tail number
   (or as required by diplomatic clearance). To complete flight plans, put the letters "RCH"
   followed by the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft
   tail number.       EXCEPTION: For aircraft 97000041 through 97000045 use RCH 9741
   through 9745.
   6.13.3. The Reach 01 and 18 call signs are reserved for the AMC/CC and 18 AF/CC.
   6.13.4. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). For actual AE missions, use the call sign ―Evac"
   followed by the five-digit aircraft number (example, Evac 12345) or mission designator.
   Refer to FLIP GP Chapter 4. When the AE portion of the mission is completed, normal call
   signs will be used. This does not alleviate the responsibility to use diplomatically cleared
   call signs when required.
6.14. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent
possible without unacceptable mission degradation.
6.15. Flight Plan/Data Verification. All waypoint data not retrieved from a current database
(WWNDB) will be verified from a current source (FLIP, NAT message, etc) for each waypoint
entered. Reference paragraph 11.2 for additional procedures.
6.16. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3 General Flight Rules, AFMAN 11-217V1
Instrument Flight Procedures, AFMAN 11-217V2 Visual Flight Procedures this chapter, and the
appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Regardless of the type of departure flown (IFR/VFR),
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  101


review the following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedure, instrument approach plate,
NOTAMS, GDSS Giant Report, and suitable terrain charts.
   6.16.1. VFR Departures.     NOTE: VFR departures will not be flown in lieu of obstacle
   clearance planning.
      6.16.1.1. VFR departures are authorized when there is no authorized IFR departure
      procedure for the airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure
      methods contained in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, when operational
      requirements dictate (i.e. tactical necessity), or when most of the sortie is planned as a
      VFR flight. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and terrain are
      avoided.
      6.16.1.2. IAW AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V2 crews are specifically authorized
      to depart VFR without meeting IFR departure procedure restrictions along the planned
      departure route with one engine inoperative while adhering to the following:
          6.16.1.2.1. Utilize radar advisory, monitoring, or control services when practical, and
          ensure flight following by any available means (i.e. FSS or C2).
          6.16.1.2.2. Consider reducing aircraft gross weight and/or delaying the mission until
          environmental conditions improve.
          6.16.1.2.3. Crews must be knowledgeable of and comply with guidance contained in
          AFMAN 11-217V2.
          6.16.1.2.4. Crews are responsible for terrain and obstacle planning/avoidance and
          must climb to the Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA) as soon as practical.
          6.16.1.2.5. Crews will use all available resources to mitigate risk. This includes (but
          not limited to) supervisors, ORM, aircraft flight manuals, and aircraft commander
          discretion.
          6.16.1.2.6. Operations IAW this authorization are to be used as the last resort when
          the mission justifies the increased risk.
      6.16.1.3. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by
      ensuring all the following conditions are met:
          6.16.1.3.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the
          departure route.
          6.16.1.3.2. One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb capability shall ensure departure or
          emergency return route provides obstacle avoidance. NOTE: If unable to comply
          with any of the above conditions, download cargo/fuel or delay until conditions can
          be met.
      6.16.1.4. Refer to FLIP for host nation VFR requirements before flying VFR outside of
      CONUS.
      6.16.1.5. When departing VFR, maintain VFR cloud clearances until obtaining an IFR
      clearance and reaching the IFR MEA.
   6.16.2. IFR Departures: Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as outlined
   in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1.
102                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


      6.16.2.1. An IFR departure is not authorized at airfields without an instrument approach.
      6.16.2.2. IFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain
      are avoided. Adhere to screen height/departure end of runway (DER) requirements for
      IFR departure planning (AFMAN 11-217V1). NOTE: Screen height requirements for
      departures depend on the agency that wrote the departure and/or the airfield where the
      departure is being flown. There is no standard or easy way for crews to determine screen
      height requirements. Therefore, when using departures other than those listed below, or
      when any doubt exists about which screen height to use, plan to cross the DER at 35 feet
      (minimum) unless you can ascertain a different screen height requirement from an
      appropriate authority. (Reference AFMAN 11-217V1 for Runway End Crossing Heights)
      6.16.2.3. Aircraft must meet the published climb gradient for the departure runway with
      all engines operating. If no minimum climb gradient is published, 200 ft/nm will be used.
      NOTE: In the event the aircraft is unable to meet the published ALL ENGINE climb
      gradient, download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable conditions exist.
      6.16.2.4. Use one of the following methods to ensure the aircraft can vertically clear all
      obstacles along the planned departure route with OEI:
         6.16.2.4.1. Special Departure Procedure (SDP). SDPs are MDS-specific OEI escape
         procedures intended only for emergency use. They are applicable after the loss of an
         engine and, where available, will be used for engine-out departure planning. Retrieve
         current SDPs from the MAJCOM approved SDP website. ‗Ad hoc‘ requests for fields
         not currently listed may be requested through OGV NLT 48 hrs prior to scheduled
         departure. HQ AMC/A3V authorizes the use of Ad Hoc SDPs for a maximum of 30
         days after the analysis date.
         6.16.2.4.2. Minimum climb gradient. The TERPS standard minimum climb gradient
         is 200 ft/nm, which is based on the standard obstacle clearance surface (OCS) of 152
         ft/nm plus the required obstacle clearance (ROC) of 48 ft/nm. If an SDP is not
         available, the crew must ensure compliance with any obstacle-based minimum climb
         gradients for the selected departure, with one-engine inoperative. Minimum climb
         gradients may be published as a ‗Trouble T‘ restriction in the IFR Take-off
         Minimums section of FLIP or on a SID.
             6.16.2.4.2.1. If operational requirements dictate, the mission execution authority
             may authorize the PIC to subtract up to 48‘/NM from the published (or standard)
             climb gradient for OEI departure planning.
                 6.16.2.4.2.1.1. For all 618 AOC (TACC) and CVAM tasked missions, and for
                 training missions with external users, the PIC is authorized to subtract up to
                 48‘/NM.
                 6.16.2.4.2.1.2. For all other missions, the OG/CC or equivalent (delegated no
                 lower than SQ/DO) may authorize the PIC to subtract up to 48‘/NM.
             6.16.2.4.2.2. Minimum climb gradients do not take into account low, close in
             obstacles (obstacles or terrain 200‘ AGL and below) which should normally be
             published as a NOTE on the SID or IFR departure procedure (Trouble T). Crews
             must also ensure the aircraft can clear these obstacles.     NOTE: If the
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  103


                 requirements of 6.16.2.4. cannot be met, download cargo/fuel or delay until more
                 favorable conditions exist.
   6.16.3. Preflight Predictive RAIM Check. Pilots are required to accomplish a predictive
   RAIM check when terminal RNAV operations (SIDs/STARs/Approaches) are flight planned
   and no other backup navigation aids/procedures are available.
       6.16.3.1. If RAIM will not be available at the time(s) and location(s) when GPS updating
       is required, the mission must be altered to a time when RAIM will be available. If the
       predictive RAIM check cannot be completed, the crew will not file terminal RNAV
       procedures.
       6.16.3.2. The following websites are available to meet this requirement and contain
       KGPS NOTAM coverage.
              6.16.3.2.1. Worldwide. <http://augur.ecacnav.com/augur/app/home>. Users will
              select the terminal/approach tool and input ICAO departure and arrival points. The
              following options must also be selected: Estimated mask angle and FDE algorithm.
              Two printouts must be generated (one for approach and one for terminal). The text
              format result option provides an easy-to-read printout of what times RAIM will be
              unavailable at the selected ICAO (baro aided column applies to C-17A aircraft).
              6.16.3.2.2. CONUS.          (accessible  from     non     dot-mil     computers)
              WWW.RAIMPREDICTION.NET. Users will select the grid display tool along with
              ―baro-aiding‖. Terminal and NPA (non-precision approach) displays both need to be
              checked.
6.17. Weather Minimums for Takeoff. Departures with weather below landing minimums is
authorized IAW AFI 11-202V3, Ch 8. When weather is below approach and landing minimums
(ceiling or visibility) a departure alternate is required (see paragraph 6.19).

Table 6.3. Weather Minimums for Takeoff.
 MISSION         VIS               REMARKS
 Operational 1000 RVR              When less than RVR 1600, but equal to or greater than RVR
                                   1000, the crew may take off if mission priority dictates,
                 (300 meters)      provided the runway has dual RVR readouts and displays
                                   (minimum RVR 1000 on both) and runway centerline lighting
                                   is operational. For any takeoff below 1600 RVR, the crew
                                   must be fully qualified.
 All others      1600 RVR          For runways with more than one operating RVR readout, RVR
                                   must read 1600 minimum on all.
                 (490 Meters)
 NOTES: If no RVR readout is available for the departure runway, visibility must be reported
 to be 1/2 mile (800 meters). When weather is below approach and landing minimums (ceiling
 or visibility) a takeoff alternate is required (See paragraph 6.19.)

6.18. Alternate Planning. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3.
Choose alternates that best meet mission requirements and conserve fuel (see Chapter 14).
 104                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


Select alternates that are not restricted by FLIP, FCG, or diplomatic clearances, and are
compatible with the mission load and performance characteristics of the aircraft. The PIC retains
final authority in the choice of alternates; however, selection by support agencies normally
should be used if they meet the above criteria and the aircraft has already been serviced.
6.19. Departure Alternates.
   6.19.1. A departure alternate is required if ceiling or visibility is below landing minimums
   for lowest suitable approach (at departure aerodrome). Do not use Category II ILS weather
   minimums to determine if a departure alternate is required.
   6.19.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the
   aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude
   (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria. To qualify as
   a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:
       6.19.2.1. For an alternate within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather must be
       equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1
       hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400), or;
       6.19.2.2. For an alternate within two hours flying time, the existing weather must be at
       least 500-1 above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but not less than
       600-2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to
       remain so for 1 hour after ETA at the alternate.
6.20. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will be
according to AFI 11-202V3 and the following:
   6.20.1. File two alternates when:
       6.20.1.1. The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for the
       available DoD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) precision approach; or
       6.20.1.2. The forecast ceiling OR visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than
       published for all other approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement
       (for example Jeppesen approaches), the minimum required ceiling shall be computed by
       taking the published HAA or HAT and rounding it up to the nearest one hundred feet (or
       as determined by MAJCOM TERPs review). For example, a Jeppesen VOR approach
       with a published HAA of 642 feet would require a forecasted ceiling of 700 feet; or
       6.20.1.3. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected
       for RCR.
   6.20.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the departure or destination
   aerodrome is outside the CONUS. EXCEPTION: OCONUS, intra-theater flights that do
   not exceed 3-hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202V3.
   6.20.3. When filing to a remote or island destination, aircrews may use 2+00 holding fuel (in
   lieu of an alternate). A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which due
   to its unique geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours
   flying time. The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following
   criteria:
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                   105


      6.20.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA
      and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and
      6.20.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published
      minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a
      precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-
      precision approach minimums (excluding ASR), but not below precision approach
      minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours). NOTE: See Chapter 14 for fuel planning
      considerations to a remote or island destination.
6.21. Adverse Weather.
   6.21.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
      6.21.1.1. The C-17A is a category III aircraft for turbulence. Crews should confirm the
      type of aircraft the forecast turbulence applies to, or what type of aircraft reported the
      encounter, to gain a more accurate picture for their route of flight. Turbulence category
      charts are found in Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002,
      Meteorological Techniques.
      6.21.1.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts
      fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated.
      WARNING: Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened
      and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
   6.21.2. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged
   operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.
   NOTE: Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological
   Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing and freezing rain is
   equivalent to severe icing. When freezing fog is forecast or reported, aircrews will confirm
   with weather agencies what type (if any) icing is associated with the freezing fog.
      6.21.2.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain. Do not takeoff under
      conditions of freezing drizzle except when aircraft has been properly de-iced/anti-iced
      IAW flight manual procedures.
      6.21.2.2. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures near 0°C, may cause
      ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When an aircraft requires de-icing/anti-
      icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following:
          6.21.2.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in their respective
          flight manual. Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all restrictions in their
          associated flight manual with respect to anti-ice/de-ice procedures and holdover
          times.
          6.21.2.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids provide little anti-icing
          benefit, and therefore have limited holdover times. As a guide, for approved anti-
          icing fluids, crews may use published anti-icing holdover times IAW TO 42C-1-2,
          Aircraft Anti-icing Procedures, and AFFSA holdover tables located at the HQ
          AFFSA website. The holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and
          the PIC shall use time, temperature, and dilution of mixture to determine when times
          are exceeded and re-apply fluid if required.
106                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


         6.21.2.2.3. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is
         completed within 5 minutes of departure.
  6.21.3. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.
  If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2000 feet,
  avoid them by at least:
      6.21.3.1. 20 NMs at or above flight level FL 230.
      6.21.3.2. 10 NMs below FL230.
      6.21.3.3. 5 NMs for tactical low-level operations below FL230 provided the outside air
      temperature is at or above 0°C at flight altitude. Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a
      rapidly moving thunderstorm. CAUTION: Aircraft damage may occur 20NMs or more
      from any thunderstorms. Aircrews must familiarize themselves with information on
      thunderstorm development and hazards. Refer to TO 1C-17A-1 and AFH 11-203V1,
      Weather for Aircrews.
  6.21.4. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be
  used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather. It should
  never be considered a normal avoidance procedure. When relying exclusively on ground-
  based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance
  instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
      6.21.4.1. Changing routing.
      6.21.4.2. Diverting to alternate.
      6.21.4.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.
  6.21.5. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and
  advected clouds (horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of
  thunderstorms.
  6.21.6. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
  departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
      6.21.6.1. Attempt to maintain VMC.
      6.21.6.2. Maintain at least 5NMs separation from heavy rain showers
      6.21.6.3. Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e., clouds within plus or minus 5,000
      feet of the freezing level or plus or minus 8°C of the freezing level. NOTE: Approaches
      or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within 10NMs providing
      they are not producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds,
      gusts fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and are not forecast or
      observed to be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to include the planned
      missed approach corridor, if applicable).
  6.21.7. When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C
  or below, refer to AFI 11-202V3 and the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) Section D,
  Temperature Correction Chart, to correct MDA, DH, and other altitudes inside the FAF.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                   107


   6.21.8. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave
   turbulence. Refer to AFH 11-203V1, Weather for Aircrews, for additional information on
   mountain wave turbulence.
   6.21.9. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET). National Weather Service in-
   flight weather advisories are not limiting to Air Force aircraft. Contact the nearest military
   weather facility or flight service station for details, if applicable.
   6.21.10. Volcanic Ash Operations.
       6.21.10.1. Aircraft flight operations through, over, or under areas of forecast or known
       volcanic activity or ash is prohibited. Plan all missions to avoid forecast of known
       volcanic activity/ash by at least 20 NMs. EXCEPTION: Operations near volcanic
       activity/ash may become operational necessary (i.e. humanitarian evacuation). In such
       cases, supplementary MAJCOM guidance will be released when operations are expected
       in known or predicted volcanic activity/ash areas.
       6.21.10.2. Anytime flight operations are directed within the vicinity of volcanic
       activity/ash, crews must stay alert for pockets of increased ash concentrations.
       Inadvertent ash penetration may be difficult to recognize, particularly at night or in IMC.
       Refer to TO 1C-17A-1 for further guidance.
       6.21.10.3. If volcanic ash is encountered (refer to TO 1C-17A-1 for indications),
       immediate action must be taken to protect the aircraft and exit the affected area.
       6.21.10.4. Crews that encounter volcanic ash or, when MAJCOM directed, are planned
       to operate through low concentrations of volcanic ash will make a write-up in the AFTO
       Form 781 annotating altitude flown and duration of flight.
   6.21.11. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most conducive to lightning
   strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
       6.21.11.1. Within 8C of freezing.
       6.21.11.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with
       thunderstorm activity.
6.22. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a logic based, common sense approach
to making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during,
and after all operations. USAF policy on ORM is contained in Air Force Policy Directive 90-9,
Operational Risk Management. PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and
local guidance as part of preflight activities.
   6.22.1. Flying units will develop a local ORM program to include personal ORM assessment
   for all missions and accomplished by all crewmembers prior to each flight.

Section 6C—Preflight

6.23. Hazard Identification and Mitigation. After the entire crew is assembled at the aircraft,
the PIC will brief primary mission hazards facing the crew during takeoff and climb-out.
6.24. AFTO Forms 781 Series.
 108                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   6.24.1. Review AFTO Forms 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or operating
   aircraft systems. An exceptional release must be signed before flight. A maintenance
   officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the exceptional
   release. If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the exceptional release.
   Ensure that the DD1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate, and AIR card are aboard the aircraft.
   6.24.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight (see Chapter 4)
   with a condition that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy
   for one flight to another station. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance
   Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and
   procedures. AFRC crews also see AFI 11-202V3/AFRCSUP1. Although a one-time flight
   may be authorized per Chapter 4, maintenance release (clearing the Red X) will still be
   required. Coordinate the maintenance release and mission requirements with the controlling
   agency. The PIC‘s concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown.
   6.24.3. For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support refer to
   paragraph 12.3
6.25. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. Reference paragraph 12.4 for additional
information.
   6.25.1. APU Usage. For fuel conservation, minimize use of APU. Aircrews will utilize
   Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) to the maximum extent possible consistent with T.O.
   guidance and mission requirements. AGE will include electrical power and heating/cooling
   units as applicable. Normal APU procedures apply for engine start/shutdown operations and
   when specifically required to accomplish pre-/post-flight checklist items.
   6.25.2. Aircrew TO 1C-17A-1 Preflight Inspection Requirements.
       6.25.2.1. The aircrew T.O 1C-17A-1preflight inspection will remain valid until either:
          6.25.2.1.1. Aircraft ground time exceeds 12 hours (72 hours provided the aircraft is
          sealed, not flown, and documented entry control is maintained).
          6.25.2.1.2. Another maintenance TO 1C-17A-6 preflight is performed.
       6.25.2.2. When an aircrew assumes a preflighted spare or quick turn, a thorough visual
       inspection will be performed.
   6.25.3. Fire Protection and Crash Rescue.
       6.25.3.1. The aircraft engine/APU fire extinguisher system fulfills the minimum
       requirements for fire protection during engine/APU start.
       6.25.3.2. A fireguard should be used for all engine starts. A crewmember or ground
       controller may act as fireguard.
6.26. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base (MOB). Reference paragraph
12.6
6.27. Aircrew Flight Equipment Requirements.
   6.27.1. Oxygen. Oxygen on board for takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned
   flight from the equal time point (ETP) to a suitable recovery base, should oxygen be
   required. Calculate crew requirements using the 100 percent Oxygen Duration Chart in the
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  109


   flight manual. Calculate crew and passenger requirements based on flight at FL 250 from the
   ETP to the nearest suitable recovery base.
       6.27.1.1. Crewmembers occupying a crew station will have an oxygen mask connected
       and readily available for use from before engine start until engine shutdown.
       6.27.1.2. Normally, unpressurized flight will not be planned above 18,000 feet cabin
       altitude (except HALO). Aircrews required to fly unpressurized missions above 20,000
       will prebreathe 100 percent oxygen in accordance with AFI 11-409
   6.27.2. Rafts. On overwater flights do not carry more passengers and crewmembers than life
   rafts will accommodate.
   6.27.3. Life preserver units (LPUs) or Personal Floatation Device. The loadmaster will
   place an LPU within easy reach of each passenger and aircrew member before takeoff on
   overwater flights (outside gliding distance to land). Ensure the appropriate number and type
   of life preservers are aboard for overwater missions carrying children and infants.
   6.27.4. Parachutes:
       6.27.4.1. Parachutes will be carried on aircraft IAW AFI 11-301V2.
       6.27.4.2. Wear (or pre-fit and preposition) parachutes and helmets when specified by
       mission directive.
   6.27.5. Fall Protection. Aircrew members are prohibited from climbing onto the upper
   fuselage or wing surfaces. Aircraft Commanders will ensure no other personnel (excluding
   qualified ops/maintenance personnel), have access to, or be allowed to, climb onto the
   fuselage or wings.
   6.27.6. (Added-DOVERAFB) Helmets, Oxygen Masks, and NVGs.
       6.27.6.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) The equipment inspection date will be checked to
       ensure it will not expire prior to mission completion. Helmets, oxygen masks, and NVGs
       will be returned to 436 OSS/AFE after mission termination.
       6.27.6.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Helmet bags will be used to transport helmets and
       oxygen masks. The helmet, mask, visor(s) and flight gloves are the only items authorized
       to be stored inside helmet bags.
       6.27.6.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) Crews will preflight NVGs prior to use by means of an
       ANV-20/20 tester or eye lane.
6.28. Fleet Service. Ensure the required fleet service items are aboard the aircraft early enough
to permit inventory prior to engine start.
6.29. Cargo Documentation. Proper cargo or mail documentation will accompany each load.
   6.29.1. Load Data Information (Applicable to AFRC/ANG completing 618 AOC (TACC)-
   directed mission). At stations where there is no mobility air transportation function, the
   aircrew will collect the required load information on each leg, and submit it to the first
   station, which has such a function. The report will be submitted on AF Form 4075, Aircraft
   Load Data Worksheet.

6.30. Airlifting Hazardous Cargo. NOTE: Installed flares do not constitute hazardous cargo.
However, any additional loads of flares are not considered aircraft equipment and shall be
properly packaged and prepared IAW AFMAN 24-204.
   6.30.1. AMCH 11-214, AMC Aircrew Hazardous Material Handbook, contains a description
   of the types and classes of hazardous cargo that may be carried. AMC and AMC-gained
   PICs are responsible for ensuring that all procedures contained in AMCH 11-214 are
   complied with when airlifting hazardous cargo.
       6.30.1.1. For more information regarding hazardous materials, refer to AFMAN 24-204,
       Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment.
   6.30.2. Flight Planning. Based on the Hazardous Cargo Briefing, the PIC will:
       6.30.2.1. Enter "Hazardous Cargo" and the mission identifier or flight number in the
       appropriate section of the flight plan. Use Remarks section of DD175, Military Flight
       Plan, and Other Information section of DD1801, International Flight Plan, DOD. Refer
       to the FCG for country specific requirements concerning over-flight when transporting
       hazardous materials cargo.
       6.30.2.2. If possible, plan the flight to minimize overflying heavily populated or
       otherwise critical areas. Approach, landing, and takeoff tracks are excluded.
       6.30.2.3. Prepare a departure message at stations when a C2 center is not available. The
       remarks section of the departure message will include: Class of hazardous material, DoD
       class or division for explosives, net explosive weight (NEW), and gross weight. If
       required, request special handling (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical escort teams,
       etc.). This message can be sent via AOC, if available.
       6.30.2.4. If estimated time en route (ETE) is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances
       preclude timely message receipt at destination, notify the next destination of the ETA and
       information listed in paragraph 6.30.2.3 If available, C2 will relay required information
       to next destination.
6.31. Handling of Classified Cargo, Registered Mail, Mission Capable (MICAP) Parts,
Very, Very Important Part (VVIP), Forward Supply System (FSS) Shipments, and Courier
Material.
   6.31.1. MICAP, VVIP, sensitive cargo, courier materials, and registered mail moving within
   the normal airlift system are receipted at the on and offload stations using the air cargo
   manifest. For unit moves operated in accordance with Defense Transportation Regulation
   (DTR), Part III, Mobility, classified or sensitive cargo movement is normally manifested
   utilizing the DD Form 2130-2, Cargo Manifest or similar automated product (such as CALM
   or AALPS), and will normally be accompanied by a unit courier. However, if
   classified/sensitive unit cargo is offered without an accompanying courier, the DD1907,
   Signature and Tally Record, must be used.
       6.31.1.1. Defense Courier Service (DCS) couriers coordinating with the PIC are
       authorized to designate officer or enlisted, (E-5 and above) crewmembers on military
       aircraft as couriers to escort and safeguard courier material when other qualified
       personnel are not available. Qualified passengers, if carried, are designated before
       designating crewmembers. The following restrictions apply:
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                     111


          6.31.1.1.1. Primary crewmembers will not be designated couriers without the consent
          of the PIC.
          6.31.1.1.2. Crewmembers on aircraft scheduled to make an extended en route stop at
          a location where DCS couriers cannot provide en route support will not be designated
          as couriers.
   6.31.2. During stops at en route locations supported by DCS stations, DCS couriers are
   required to meet designated couriers, guard and protect the material.
       6.31.2.1. During unscheduled en route stops crewmembers may place courier material in
       temporary custody of the following agencies in descending order of priority.
          6.31.2.1.1. DCS courier.
          6.31.2.1.2. TOP SECRET control officer of the US armed forces.
          6.31.2.1.3. US Department of State Diplomatic Courier.
          6.31.2.1.4. US Department of State activity.
          6.31.2.1.5. US military guards.
          6.31.2.1.6. US DOD civilian guards.
   6.31.3. If unable to follow the itinerary to the destination of the courier material, or material
   is lost, stolen or otherwise compromised, report circumstances to the nearest Defense Courier
   Station and notify the local US military commander or US Government activity.
   6.31.4. Life or death urgency shipments consist of biological or other medical supplies of
   such urgency that human life is dependent upon immediate receipt. Shipments will be
   manifested separately and the manifest annotated with the words LIFE OR DEATH
   URGENCY. All shipments will be handled on a hand-to-hand receipt basis, using either the
   air cargo manifest or the DD1907, for unit moves. The PIC, or designated representative,
   will be briefed on the urgency of the shipment and be made the custodian during flight.

Section 6D—Departure

6.32. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are on time if the aircraft is airborne within -20 /
+14 minutes of scheduled takeoff time or as specified in a MAJCOM supplement.
   6.32.1. Scheduled takeoff time may be adjusted to meet a time over target (TOT) or time of
   arrival (TOA). PICs shall notify C2 agency before takeoff to adjust the scheduled takeoff
   time.
   6.32.2. Early Departures. Early departures are authorized to prevent a delay due to weather,
   ATC restrictions, airfield or aircraft operational limitations, to adjust mission flow during a
   large-scale operation, or if approved through C2 channels provided the impact on local and
   downrange facilities and crew duty is evaluated.
6.33. NVG Departures.
   6.33.1. NVG Departure Weather Minimums. Weather minimums for NVG departures for
   crewmembers who are non-current and/or unqualified is 1500/3. Current and qualified NVG
   aircrews may fly NVG departures weather down to 600/2 (OG/CC or equivalent may
 112                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   approve down to 300/1). Crews must give careful consideration to potential hazards during
   the critical phase of flight. Other weather limitations are IAW this instruction and AFI 11-
   202V3. NVGs have inherent limitations which can further be reduced by poor weather
   conditions. Crews will consider weather conditions, moon illumination and position, sky
   glow at dawn and dusk, cultural lighting, and weapon/expendable effects when planning
   NVG operations.
   6.33.2. NVG Crosswind Limits for Departure.
       6.33.2.1. Runways 90-120 feet wide. Maximum crosswind component is 15 knots.
       6.33.2.2. Runways wider than 120. Maximum crosswind component is 20 knots.
       EXCEPTION: OG/CC may approve up to a 30 knot crosswind component.
   6.33.3. NVG Malfunctions During Takeoff. During an NVG takeoff, if the PF experiences
   NVG failure, the takeoff may be continued at the discretion of the PIC. The PIC will brief
   NVG failure on takeoff procedures. The PM will be ready to immediately assume aircraft
   control if the PF experiences spatial disorientation or an NVG malfunction.

Section 6E—En route

6.34. Flight Progress. In-flight, use all available navigational aids to monitor mission computer
navigation performance. Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability
that degrades centerline accuracy to the controlling air route traffic control center (ARTCC).
   6.34.1. Oceanic procedures. Crews will use only the MNPS Oceanic Checklist and the
   Oceanic Expanded Checklist for oceanic crossings. Locally generated oceanic checklists are
   prohibited. Where appropriate, units may augment the MNPS checklist with local
   supplements such as ALTRV, formation, and other unique mission requirements but in no
   case will they substitute for the MNPS checklist.
       6.34.1.1. For North Atlantic Oceanic airspace, pilots will follow the procedures written
       in the latest version of the MNPS manual. The MNPS manual is produced by the North
       Atlantic Systems Planning Group (NAT SPG) which does not have the authority to direct
       crew actions, hence the use of the word ―should‖ throughout the document. However,
       where the MNPS manual uses ―should,‖ crews will interpret this as ―shall.‖ DoD Area
       Planning procedures will be followed only if they do not conflict with the MNPSA
       manual.
       6.34.1.2. For Northern Pacific Oceanic airspace, pilots will follow the procedures written
       in the FAA Alaska or Pacific Supplement. DoD Area Planning procedures will be
       followed only if they do not conflict with these Supplements.
       6.34.1.3. Pilots will use the following procedure prior to entering oceanic airspace to
       comply with coast out/in (gross nav) navigation accuracy checks.
           6.34.1.3.1. Select a NAVAID that provides a DME signal (within its standard service
           volume range) as close to the beam position from the aircraft as possible. DME
           distance should be no closer than the first two digits of the flight level value (e.g.
           FL310 equals a minimum distance of 31 miles).
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                    113


         6.34.1.3.2. Display progress page 1on an MCD and enter the NAVAID identifier at
         BRG DST TO LSK 5R.
         6.34.1.3.3. Change one MFD to the ND Compass display and associated MFC HDG
         REF SEL switch to TRUE.
         6.34.1.3.4. Change the NAVAID CDI course selector so as to center the CDI for a
         course TO the NAVAID, note the DME distance then immediately record the
         progress page course and distance information displayed onto the Master Document.
         6.34.1.3.5. Record the following navigation accuracy check information on the
         master document: NAVAID identifier, time (UTC), MC ANP or FOM value, and
         courses and distances from progress page display and ND Compass display.
         6.34.1.3.6. If the noted DME distance and course in the CNC window are not within
         4 miles and 4 degrees attempt another navigation accuracy check with another
         NAVAID, check MC position during over flight of a VOR /NDB, or use ATC radar
         position information referencing a NAVAID or airfield compared with the progress
         page 1 BRG DST TO LSK 5R.
     6.34.1.4. Ten minute plotting information will include the following:
         6.34.1.4.1. Full Lat/Long position
         6.34.1.4.2. UTC time at that position
         6.34.1.4.3. Flight level/Altitude
         6.34.1.4.4. MC position update source with MC ANP/FOM
         6.34.1.4.5. Pilot ID switch position
     6.34.1.5. Hourly altimeter checks (if required) will be annotated on the master document.
  6.34.2. Another pilot will verify waypoint data inserted into the Mission Computer. Check
  both the coordinate information and the distances between waypoints against the flight plan.
     6.34.2.1. Once the oceanic clearance is received and any time the oceanic clearance is
     changed, both pilots will reverify waypoint data inserted into the Mission Computer
  6.34.3. Obtain a coast out fix prior to, or immediately on entering the Category I Route or
  over-water segment. Perform a gross navigational error check using available NAVAIDS
  and annotate the position and time on the chart.
  6.34.4. When approaching each waypoint on a Category I route, recheck coordinates for the
  next waypoint.
  6.34.5. Approximately 10 minutes after passing each oceanic waypoint, record and plot the
  aircraft position and time on the chart, and ensure compliance with courses and ETA
  tolerances.
  6.34.6. If a revised clearance is received, record and plot the new route of flight on the chart.
  6.34.7. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. (See FLIP, FCG, and AP, for
  further guidance). US military aircraft and DoD personnel entering another nation to conduct
  US government business must have the approval of the foreign government concerned to
114                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


  enter their airspace. Foreign clearances for US international air operations are obtained
  through US officials known as Defense Attaché Officers (DAOs).
      6.34.7.1. Consistent with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12NMs.
      Diplomatic constraints and/or a lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions
      operating in international airspace. Therefore, it is imperative sufficient information be
      provided far enough in advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements established
      by the countries concerned. The US does not normally recognize territorial claims
      beyond 12NMs; however, specific guidance from certain US authorities may establish
      limits, which differ from the standard.
      6.34.7.2. Flight Information Region (FIR). An FIR is an area of airspace within which
      flight information and related services are provided. An FIR does not reflect
      international borders or sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an established
      FIR without approval of the adjacent country, provided the AC avoids flight in territorial
      airspace.
      6.34.7.3. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace
      into territorial airspace, for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not
      amend entry point(s).
      6.34.7.4. Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or
      departure of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace for which a
      clearance has not been duly requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
      6.34.7.5. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for
      penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective
      country. Aircraft clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
      6.34.7.6. In the event ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or attempts
      to negate existing clearances, ACs must evaluate the circumstances. The normal
      response will be to attempt to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft will continue to
      planned destination, as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase is "in
      international airspace."   Safety of flight is paramount in determining mission
      continuation. Under no circumstances should aircrews construe a clearance, which routes
      their mission over sovereign airspace, which was not approved through diplomatic
      channels before mission departure, as being valid authorization.
      6.34.7.7. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing
      will normally be briefed at home station, onload station, and/or by the last C2 facility
      transited before performing the critical portion of the mission.
      6.34.7.8. Aircrews (except on weather reconnaissance missions) normally are not tasked
      to and should not fly "due regard" routings unless coordinated with the appropriate
      MAJCOM C2 and specifically directed in the mission FRAG. The "due regard" or
      "operational" option obligates the military AC to be their own ATC agency to separate
      their aircraft from all other air traffic. If operational requirements dictate, ACs may
      exercise the "due regard" option to protect their aircraft. Aircraft will return to normal air
      traffic services as soon as practical.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                   115


6.35. Communications Instructions Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings and Other
Reports. Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as indicated in FLIP planning or
FLIP En route Supplement.
   6.35.1. In-flight harassment or hostile action against aircraft. Aircraft subjected to
   harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF
   air and ground voice facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type,
   insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed,
   and the type of harassment. Request relay of the report to the nearest C2 agency. Also,
   attempt to contact the nearest command post when in UHF and VHF range.
   6.35.2. Other incidents will be reported as indicated in JCS Pub 6V5 and AFMAN10-206,
   Operational Reporting.
6.36. In-Flight Meals. Pilots should not eat meals at the same time, and their meals should
consist of different menu items.
6.37. Communications.
   6.37.1. CPDLC/ADS data link communications will only be used on AERO-I.
   6.37.2. Crews will conduct an HF radio ground check before takeoff if use of the HF radio
   may be required for ATC or C2 communications. Attempt to establish HF contact before
   going out of UHF/VHF range. If unable to establish HF contact with the controlling HF
   station, and an alternate means of relay of ATC information is not available, the aircraft
   should return to the nearest suitable support base.
   6.37.3. Pilots shall provide ARTCC position and weather observations when required. If
   unable to contact an ATC agency, attempt to relay through the GLOBAL HF stations.
6.38. In-flight Emergency Procedures. The PIC shall report deviations from directives that
may occur as a result of an emergency according to AFI 11-202V3. Time and conditions
permitting, inform passengers of the situation and intentions.
   6.38.1. Notification of Control Agencies. When practical after completing the aircraft
   emergency action checklists and associated actions, the PIC shall furnish ATC and
   appropriate C2 agencies with a description of the difficulty, assistance required, intentions,
   and any other pertinent information.
   6.38.2. The PIC may initiate a CONFERENCE HOTEL/SKYHOOK when additional
   expertise is necessary. Communications procedures are as follow:
       6.38.2.1. Local Area. Use appropriate UHF or VHF frequencies.
       6.38.2.2. En route. Attempt to establish a phone patch with the nearest or controlling C2
       Center using AERO-I, global HF network, UHF/VHF stations, SATCOM, etc. If unable,
       aircrews are permitted to use ARINC radio service as an additional avenue for phone
       patch connectivity.
       6.38.2.3. Provide the following information when time permits:
          6.38.2.3.1. Description of the situation to include actions taken and intentions.
          6.38.2.3.2. What assistance is being requested.
 116                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


           6.38.2.3.3. Fuel on board and hours of endurance.
           6.38.2.3.4. Position.
           6.38.2.3.5. Altitude and flight conditions.
           6.38.2.3.6. Number of personnel and DVs on board.
           6.38.2.3.7. Qualification of PIC.
           6.38.2.3.8. Planned landing destination and ETA.
6.39. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care,
the PIC will notify the station of intended landing in sufficient time so the aircraft may be met by
medical personnel. Notification will include the patient‘s sex, approximate age, and major
complaint.
6.40. Weather Forecasts. It is the pilot‘s responsibility to obtain destination weather prior to
descent. The primary sources are 618 AOC (TACC) weather operations, OWSs, and USAF
weather flights via pilot-to-meteorologist service (PMSV) or through a USAF aeronautical
station. For aircraft flying in EUCOM AOR (ENAME operations) contact USAFE/OWS at
Sembach AB GE. SOUTHCOM AOR contact 612 SPTS/WX (612th Support Squadron/Weather
Flight) at Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ. The ATC system can provide weather information to en
route aircraft.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.41. Descent. Prior to the top of descent (TOD), the PIC will identify and discuss mitigation of
associated hazards to the penetration, approach, landing, and airfield. Before descent into
unfamiliar areas, pilots will review appropriate terrain charts to increase aircrew situational
awareness of obstructions. Every effort will be made to accomplish briefings and appropriate
checklists prior to TOD. Primary crewmembers will not be involved in duties other than aircraft
operations, descent and approach monitoring, and required checklist items from the initial
descent point to landing.
   6.41.1. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at
   night or during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available
   approved instrument approach. A visual approach may be flown during night VFR
   conditions if an approved instrument approach to the landing runway is not available or
   operational missions require a tactical approach.
       6.41.1.1. On training/evaluation flights, pilots may fly non-precision approaches or VFR
       traffic patterns to accomplish required training and evaluations. The pilot monitoring
       will monitor a precision approach when practical to enhance safety.
       6.41.1.2. For recovery at home station, pilots may elect to fly a visual or non-precision
       approach, if weather minimums permit.
6.42. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   6.42.1. Aircraft approach category. The C-17 is a category "D" aircraft. If maneuvering
   speed exceeds 165 knots, the minimums for category "E" will be used.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                    117


  6.42.2. Prior to starting an instrument approach, pilots will confirm their aircraft can comply
  with the missed approach climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11-202V3. If
  unable to meet required climb gradients, pilots must coordinate alternate missed approach
  procedures with ATC, which will ensure terrain clearance, prior to commencing the
  approach. If this is not possible, do not attempt the approach.
  6.42.3. Weather minimums. Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an en
  route descent, pilots will confirm the existing weather is reported to be:
     6.42.3.1. At or above required visibility for straight-in or sidestep approaches.
         6.42.3.1.1. For PAR approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 2400 (730
         meters) or 1/2 mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR readout available.
     6.42.3.2. At or above required ceiling and visibility for circling approaches.
         6.42.3.2.1. For circling approaches with no published ceiling requirement, the
         required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 feet
         rounded up to the next one hundred foot value. (For example, if the HAA is 747 feet,
         add 100 feet to get 847 feet and then round up to the next one hundred foot value
         which would be 900 feet. Your ceiling for the approach must be at or above 900
         feet.) When circling minimums are published, but not by category, circling approach
         minimums will be as published, but in no case lower than 600 feet and 2 miles
         visibility.
     6.42.3.3. Inoperative Approach Lighting. Increase the published visibility minimums of
     an instrument approach by ½ SM or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach
     plate, when any component of the runway approach lighting system (ALS) is inoperative.
     (This applies only to the ALS itself, not to VASIs, PAPIs, and other lights that are not a
     component of the ALS.)
     6.42.3.4. If the ceiling is below the value depicted for published DoD or approved
     precision approach, but visibility is at or above authorized minimums, comply with fuel
     requirements of Chapter 14 before initiating enroute descent, penetration, or approach.
     6.42.3.5. Variable visibility/ceiling reports. If variable visibilities/ceilings are reported,
     pilots may use the greatest value reported. If it is subsequently determined that weather
     is below minimums for the approach, comply with 6.42.10. Do not attempt further
     approaches until the lowest visibility/ceiling reported is at/above approach minimums.
  6.42.4. Flight Instrumentation Requirements. Aircraft are limited to a DH/MDA based on a
  HAT of 300-feet and RVR 4000, or ¾-mile visibility (1220-meters) with no RVR if full
  flight instrumentation is not available and operational.
     6.42.4.1. PAR and Category I ILS. Full flight instrumentation consists of: the flight
     director, a HUD or PFD and NAV display at each station, and no shared ADC or IRU.
     6.42.4.2. Full flight instrumentation for a CAT II ILS includes the flight director, a HUD
     or PFD and NAV display at each station, and no ―No CAT II‖ warning message. A HUD
     will be used by the PF position, if available.
  6.42.5. Category I ILS Procedures. Decision altitude for precision approaches will be as
  published, but no lower than 200 feet height above touchdown (HAT).
118                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


      6.42.5.1. ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches. Both pilots must be
      certified to conduct an ILS PRM approach. Comply with the following operational
      procedures:
         6.42.5.1.1. Two operational VHF communication radios are required.
         6.42.5.1.2. The approach must be briefed as an ILS/PRM approach.
         6.42.5.1.3. If unable to accept an ILS PRM approach clearance, contact the FAA
         ATCSCC at 1-800-333-4286 prior to departure time to obtain a pre-coordinated
         arrival time. Pilots who arrive at a PRM airport unable to accept PRM approach
         clearance, who did not contact ATC prior to departure, should expect an ATC
         directed divert to a non-PRM airport.
         6.42.5.1.4. All breakouts from the approach shall be hand flown. Autopilots shall be
         disengaged when a breakout is directed.
         6.42.5.1.5. Should a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) be received, the pilot shall
         immediately respond to the RA. If following an RA requires deviating from an ATC
         clearance, the pilot shall advise ATC as soon as practical. While following an RA,
         comply with the turn portion of the ATC breakout instruction unless the pilot
         determines safety to be a factor.
  6.42.6. Category II ILS Procedures. DH is based on radar altitude. Minimum HAT is 100
  feet. Minimum RVR is 1200. Maximum crosswind limitation is 10 knots.
      6.42.6.1. Aircrews will not execute an actual Category II ILS to minimums unless both
      pilots are qualified and current in Category II ILS. The AC must have logged at least
      100 hours in command since AC certification.
  6.42.7. MLS Approaches. Manual MLS approaches are not authorized without MAJCOM/
  A3/DO approval.
  6.42.8. NDB Approach Procedures. NDB approaches may be flown during day, night, or
  IMC conditions after compliance with any airfield restrictions in GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR.
  Back up each approach with available navaids/GPS to include loading the NDB coordinates
  in the Mission Computer .
  6.42.9. RNAV Procedures. See Chapter 11.
  6.42.10. After beginning an Enroute Descent. IAW the Descent, Approach, and Landing
  section of AFI 11-202V3, after starting an enroute descent, and the weather is reported or
  observed to be below approach minimums, the AC has the option of continuing the approach
  to the missed approach point (MAP)/DH. Comply with the last assigned clearance until a
  new or amended clearance is received.
  6.42.11. Holding. An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but
  forecast to improve to or above minimums provided:
      6.42.11.1. The aircraft has more fuel remaining than that required to fly to the alternate
      and hold for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to
      remain at or above alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  119


       6.42.11.2. Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before excess fuel
       will be consumed.
6.43. NVG Approach and Landing.
   6.43.1. NVG Approach Weather Minimums. Aircrews may fly NVG instrument approaches
   which transition to NVG landings with weather down to 600/2(180m/3200m) (OG/CC or
   equivalent may approve down to 300/1[90m/1600m]) or circling minimums (whichever is
   higher).
   6.43.2. NVG Crosswind Limits for Approach.
       6.43.2.1. Runways 90-120 feet wide. Maximum crosswind component is 15 knots.
       6.43.2.2. Runways wider than 120. Maximum crosswind component is 20 knots.
       EXCEPTION: with OG/CC (or equivalent) approval, up to 30 knots crosswind
       component is authorized.
   6.43.3. NVG Failures During Approach and Landing. If the pilot or copilot experience
   NVG failure or other malfunctions at or below 300 feet AGL, perform a go-around. PIC will
   brief NVG failure procedures after touchdown.
   6.43.4. (Added-DOVERAFB) Runway 32 is the runway designated for NVG operations.
   There are two configurations of covert lighting used for NVG operations at Dover AFB; a
   150‘ wide configuration and a 90‘ wide box. Reference 436th OG, OI 11-10 for additional
   guidance.
6.44. Unscheduled Landings. When an unscheduled landing or crew rest occurs at a base
without a passenger facility, the AC should immediately advise the appropriate C2 agency and
request assistance in arranging substitute airlift for passengers on board. The following
procedures apply when obtaining support for service members, in a group travel status, who are
transported on AMC organic aircraft flying a Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)
mission, which incur an unscheduled delay due to weather or maintenance problems, forcing the
members to be lodged at that location until the aircraft can continue its mission.
   6.44.1. If the delay is at a location where DoD facilities and AMC TWCF funds are
   available, payment for lodging (contract or on-base) will be made by the local accounting
   liaison/OPLOC citing TWCF funds. The appropriate TWCF fund cite may be obtained from
   the local financial analysis and/or accounting liaison office. Normally, a BPA contract or AF
   IMT 616 is already established at these locations to charge the routine lodging costs for
   transient or TDY individuals who are on TWCF funded travel orders.
   6.44.2. If the delay is at a location where DoD facilities are available and AMC TWCF funds
   are not available, utilize SF 44, United States Air Force Invoice authority to acquire the
   appropriate lodging accommodations. Upon return to home station, the PIC will send the SF
   44 to the local accounting liaison office. A copy of the service members' group travel orders,
   along with any other pertinent supporting data, must accompany the form (e.g., lodging
   invoice and/or receipts). When the SF 44 has been validated, it will be forwarded for
   payment, citing the funds of the unit whose aircraft was delayed.
   6.44.3. If the delay is at a location where both DoD facilities and TWCF funds are
   unavailable, the PIC will utilize SF 44 authority to acquire the appropriate meals, quarters,
   and transportation to support the service members. Upon return to home station, the PIC will
 120                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   send the SF 44 to the local accounting liaison office. A copy of the service members' group
   travel orders, along with any other pertinent supporting data, must accompany the form (e.g.,
   lodging invoice and/or receipts). When the SF 44 has been validated, it will be forwarded for
   payment, citing the funds of the unit whose aircraft was delayed. NOTE: This policy does
   not apply to those passengers on delayed TWCF organic aircraft who are in a per diem or
   space available status, except for those duty passengers on TWCF funded travel orders
   delayed at locations where TWCF funds are available.
6.45. Maintenance. Complete the AFTO Form 781 after each flight. After landing,
crewmembers debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, avionics
equipment, and all installed special equipment as required. At stations without maintenance
support, when a maintenance requirement exists the PIC will ensure a thorough debrief is
provided to the C2 agency. On all AMC/AFRC missions, notify 618 AOC (TACC) Logistics
Control (618 AOC (TACC/XOCL)).
   6.45.1. An entry will be placed in AFTO 781A, "Aircraft Subjected to Salt Spray" (state
   lowest altitude and duration) anytime the aircraft is flown over water, under 1000 feet above
   sea level for longer than 30 minutes.
   6.45.2. An entry will be placed in AFTO 781A, ―Aircraft Operated on Semi-Prepared
   Runway‖ (state number of landings and takeoffs accomplished on the semi-prepared
   runway).
6.46. Border Clearance. The border clearance responsibility will be as designated by the base
or area command in accordance with AFI 24-401, AFI 24-402, AFI 24-403, Border Clearance,
Customs Program, and other United States Entry Requirements and Related Areas.
   6.46.1. Normal Operations.
       6.46.1.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border
       clearance of its aircraft.
       6.46.1.2. When support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC.
       Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or to the loadmaster, but the PIC retains
       ultimate responsibility. When a C-17 aircraft is on-loaded at a base without an air traffic
       function, the PIC is responsible for ensuring the following:
          6.46.1.2.1. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers possess current passports and valid
          visas, when required.
          6.46.1.2.2. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers have current certificates of
          immunization (shot record).
          6.46.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
          6.46.1.2.4. Departing or entering the United States through a location where border
          clearance can be obtained.
          6.46.1.2.5. Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and
          baggage, if required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign
          area.
          6.46.1.2.6. Spraying the aircraft (see the FCG and Paragraph 6.47.).
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                     121


  6.46.2. Procedures for US Entry.
     6.46.2.1. En route, the loadmaster will distribute personal customs declarations (when
     not accomplished by passenger services) to all passengers, troops, and crewmembers.
     The loadmaster will also brief passengers and crewmembers on customs regulations, and
     prepare and compile necessary border clearance forms for the PIC's signature.
     6.46.2.2. En route, notify the C2 agency at the base of intended landing of any change in
     ETA to ensure that border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
     6.46.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an aircraft,
     which has landed in the United States for customs clearance, to proceed to another base
     in the US to obtain border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of
     cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the offload station, and saves intermediate
     offloading and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The permit to
     proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing where the border clearance must be
     completed or a new permit to proceed issued by a customs official. Do not make
     intermediate stops between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination of
     manifested cargo unless required by an emergency or directed by the controlling C2
     center.
     6.46.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
     normally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane
     passengers, troops, or crewmembers unless necessary for safety or the preservation of life
     and property (loadmaster excepted). Do not unload until approved by customs and
     agriculture personnel or their designated representatives. This procedure applies to the
     initial landing in the US and all landings required when operating on a permit to proceed
     or until all crew, passengers, and cargo complete final border clearance.
  6.46.3. Inspections of U.S. Aircraft by Foreign Officials.
     6.46.3.1. Follow USAF policy on status of military aircraft as stated in the FCG, General
     Information (Chapter 3). In substance, this policy holds that US military aircraft are
     immune from searches, seizures, and inspections (including customs and safety
     inspections) by foreign officials. In addition, PICs must be aware of, and adhere to, any
     specific FCG provisions for individual countries.
     6.46.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use
     the following procedures.
         6.46.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the
         PIC to the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to
         search without consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials
         in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as
         not to offend foreign authorities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have
         authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.46.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC should make
         every effort to delay the search until he or she can contact USAF headquarters
         (through MAJCOM C2) or the appropriate embassy officials. The PIC should then
122                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


         notify these agencies of foreign request by the most expeditious means available and
         follow their instructions.
         6.46.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending
         notification to USAF headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the PIC should
         indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying
         time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do
         so.
         6.46.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
         way on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he protests the course of action
         being pursued and that he intends to notify both USAF headquarters and the
         appropriate American embassy of the foreign action. The PIC should not attempt
         physical resistance, and should thereafter report the incident to USAF headquarters
         and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The PIC should escort foreign
         authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
      6.46.3.3. Other procedures may apply when carrying sensitive cargo or equipment.
      Follow these procedures and applicable portions of classified FCG supplements.
  6.46.4. Exercises and Contingency Operations.
      6.46.4.1. General. Certain airlift missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or
      exit, require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health,
      immunization, and agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding,
      between these agencies and MAJCOM establishes certain procedures and waivers.
      6.46.4.2. Implementation. Implementation of the agreement is not automatic. Traffic
      and border clearing agencies implement all or part of the agreement as necessary for each
      operation. Inspection and clearance may be accomplished at the US onload or offload
      base, or at the foreign onload or offload base.
      6.46.4.3. Customs Procedures.
         6.46.4.3.1. Outbound: No requirement. Filing of Customs Form 7507, General
         Declaration (Outward/Inward), is not required unless directed.
         6.46.4.3.2. Inbound. Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival:
             6.46.4.3.2.1. Customs Form 7507 (Passenger list not required).

                 baggage.
                 6.46.4.3.2.3.2. One copy of the US Customs Baggage Declaration Form for
                 each passenger not under command of the troop commander, to include
                 observers, support personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crewmembers.
                 6.46.4.3.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
                 representative will meet the aircraft and accept the troop commander's
                 certificate with respect to troop baggage. Individual baggage declarations are
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  123


               not required. The troop commander should have inspected troop baggage.
               6.46.4.3.2.3.4. Troops will debark under the observation of the customs
               representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The customs
               officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection.
            6.46.4.3.2.4. For troops who are out of the country 140 days or more:

               each passenger. This includes observers, support personnel, civilians, news
               media personnel, and crewmembers. Personnel may use DD 1854, Customs
               Accompanied Baggage, U.S., or Customs Form 6059B.
               6.46.4.3.2.4.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
               representative will meet the aircraft and collect all declarations. Troops will
               debark under the observation of the customs representative who may make
               discretionary examination of the baggage.
     6.46.4.4. Public Health Procedures.
        6.46.4.4.1. When operating from a base without a traffic officer, the AC will ensure
        all crewmembers and passengers are properly immunized.
        6.46.4.4.2. Spray the aircraft if required.
     6.46.4.5. Immigration Procedures.
        6.46.4.5.1. Outbound: No requirements.
        6.46.4.5.2. Inbound: Submit the following to the immigration inspector if carrying
        civilian passengers.
            6.46.4.5.2.1. One copy of Customs Form 7507 (found at http://www.customs.gov).
     6.46.4.6. Agriculture Procedures:
        6.46.4.6.1. Outbound: No requirement.
        6.46.4.6.2. Inbound: Consult AMC Border Clearance Guide.
            6.46.4.6.2.1. The command being airlifted will instruct troops that no fresh fruit,
            milk, milk products, vegetables, plants, plant pests, soil samples, animals, meat,
            and animal products can be brought into the United States. All items of troop
            personal gear/cargo are to be thoroughly cleaned of mud, dirt, sand, and other
            foreign material before being brought aboard the aircraft. Personal gear and
            equipment must be examined for snails and other plant pests to prevent their
            accidental entry into the U.S.
            6.46.4.6.2.2. Before loading, the command responsible for cargo being airlifted
            will clear vehicles and cargo of snails or other plant pests and of all mud and soil.
            6.46.4.6.2.3. When required by agricultural quarantine regulations, the FCG, or
            higher headquarters, the aircraft will receive an aerosol treatment 30 minutes
            before landing.
            6.46.4.6.2.4. On arrival, agricultural inspectors will inspect the aircraft after
            troops have disembarked. Crewmembers will assemble remains of in-flight
 124                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


              lunches for prompt removal by fleet service personnel.
              6.46.4.6.2.5. Inspectors examine baggage, equipment, vehicles, and cargo as
              offloaded. Any items, vehicles, or cargo found to be contaminated will be held
              for such treatment as the inspector may direct (washing, steam cleaning, physical
              cleaning, or fumigation).
   6.46.5. Military Customs Pre-clearance Inspection Program. All crewmembers will ensure
   compliance with Military Customs Pre-clearance requirements.
6.47. Insect and Pest Control.
   6.47.1. Responsibility. PICs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to
   AFJI 48-104, Medical and Agricultural Foreign and Domestic Quarantine Regulations for
   Vessels, Aircraft, and Other Transports of the Armed Forces (Joint), Department of Defense
   FCG, or as directed by higher headquarters. Certify the spraying on Customs Form 7507, or
   on forms provided by the country transited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with
   passengers on board. The only exception is when mandated by the FCG.
       6.47.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent,
       National Stock Number (NSN) 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft.
       Wear leather or Nomex gloves while spraying.
          6.47.1.1.1. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being
          sprayed.
          6.47.1.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely
          loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments,
          wheel wells, and other similar spaces.
          6.47.1.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the
          aircraft after the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and
          ventilation openings. CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after
          use, spray before boarding crew or passengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10
          minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on
          board.
       6.47.1.2. Spray for 105 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being
       transited. NOTE: Keep used aerosol cans separate from other trash so they may be
       disposed of safely.
   6.47.2. Responsibility of PIC In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the
   aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, airfield management operations, or airport
   manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
   6.47.3. Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not
   open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for
   insect or rodent infestation. Do not onload or offload cargo or passengers until the inspection
   is satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local
   requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                   125


Section 6G—Miscellaneous

6.48. Dropped Objects. If an externally dropped object is discovered, the flight crew will:
   6.48.1. Notify TACC or the controlling agency as soon as practical; include details of
   routing, altitude, weather, etc.
   6.48.2. Notify maintenance at the first military station transited.
6.49. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). If involved in a mishap or incident, after landing and
terminating the emergency, pull the CVR circuit breaker. Do not get confused between the CVR
and SFDR. Crews should NOT pull the SFDR circuit breaker following a mishap or incident.
6.50. Aircrew Flight Equipment and Dash 21 Equipment Documentation. The PIC or
designated representative will:
   6.50.1. Before departing home station or en route stations, ensure appropriate serviceable
   protective clothing, aircrew flight equipment, survival, and Dash 21 equipment for the entire
   or remainder of the mission are aboard the aircraft.
   6.50.2. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review AF
   Form 4076, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, to ensure all required Dash 21 equipment
   has been certified as installed by maintenance, the initial check has been signed by
   maintenance, and configuration documents match mission requirements.
   6.50.3. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review, sign,
   and date the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Aircrew Flight Equipment, to ensure all required
   protective clothing and aircrew flight equipment and survival equipment have been certified
   as installed by aircrew flight equipment personnel and that configuration documents match
   mission requirements. Ensure appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard for
   over-water missions carrying children and infants.
       6.50.3.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Sign the AFTO Form 46 for all departures to include
       local training missions.
   6.50.4. Missing Equipment.        Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will
   accomplish the following:
       6.50.4.1. Make an AFTO Form 781A entry for equipment found missing. Additionally,
       ensure equipment removed from the aircraft at an en route station is documented in the
       AFTO Form 781A.
       6.50.4.2. Annotate AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form 46 in the next vacant column
       indicating the quantity remaining for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is
       entered above the check number of that column. Leave AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form
       46 on board the aircraft in the event of an en route crew change.
       6.50.4.3. Advise the PIC and determine whether the missing equipment should be
       recovered or replaced before mission continuation.
       6.50.4.4. Assist, as required, in preparing reports of survey for missing equipment.
       6.50.4.5. When possible, advise appropriate aircrew flight equipment or C2 agency (or
       airport management) before mission continuation.
 126                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   6.50.5. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the preflight than is
   annotated on the AF Form 4076 or AFTO Form 46, annotate the total quantity in the next
   vacant column for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check
   number of that column.
6.51. Not Used.
6.52. Airfield Data Reports. Aircrews transiting unfamiliar airfields or airfields where
conditions may adversely affect subsequent flight will:
   6.52.1. Report airfield characteristics that produce illusions, such as runway length, width,
   slope, and lighting, as compared to standard runways, sloping approach terrain, runway
   contrast against surrounding terrain, haze, glare, etc., and previously unknown obstacles,
   airfield markings, or other safety critical items to HQ AMC/A3AS.
   6.52.2. Debrief the next C2 center transited.
6.53. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the
PIC should impound the aircraft immediately after landing IAW AFI 21-101and contact the
controlling C2 agency for further instructions.
6.54. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria.
Acceptance of traffic information, instructions to follow an aircraft, or a visual approach
clearance is acknowledgment that the PIC will ensure takeoff and landing intervals and accepts
responsibility of providing wake turbulence separation. Refer to FLIP General Planning (GP) for
more information concerning wake turbulence separation.
6.55. Overflying En Route Stops. The C2 agency may approve a request to overfly a
scheduled en route stop (ANG Command Center for ANG-directed missions, AFRC command
center for AFRC-directed missions).
6.56. Classified Equipment and Material. Comply with the following or as directed in
MAJCOM supplement.
   6.56.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is onboard, ensure the C2 Center or airfield
   management operations office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security according to
   Chapter 7 of this AFI. At bases not under jurisdiction of the Air Force, ensure the aircraft
   and equipment are protected. AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management,
   provides specific guidance concerning the security of various levels of classified equipment
   aboard aircraft. For classified aircraft components which cannot be removed and stored, seal
   the aircraft. If available, use Ravens to guard the aircraft; otherwise, use guards employed by
   the host country for flightline/airport area control. Do not leave unguarded classified
   information stored in navigation or radio equipment.
   6.56.2. Material. Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination
   and receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified material. The on-site C2 center will
   provide temporary storage for COMSEC and other classified materials during en route,
   turnaround, and crew rest stops. If a storage facility is not available, the aircraft gun storage
   box may be used for material classified up to and including SECRET. Encrypted COMSEC
   will only be transferred to authorized DoD personnel.
   6.56.3. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode 4 when required for mission
   accomplishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode 4 (ground
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                      127


   test assets permitting) before deployment overseas, or as specified in the OPORD or
   contingency/exercise tasking.
   6.56.4. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode 4 before takeoff. Do not delay takeoff nor cancel
   a mission for an inoperable Mode 4, except when the aircraft will transit an area where safe
   passage procedures are implemented.
   6.56.5. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode 4 on all missions departing the CONUS for
   overseas locations. Aircrews can request the Mode 4 interrogation check through NORAD
   on UHF 364.2.
   6.56.6. Aircraft with inoperable Mode 4 will continue to their intended destinations. Repairs
   will be accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and maintenance
   technicians are available. In theaters where safe passage is implemented, aircraft will follow
   procedures for inoperable Mode 4 as directed in the applicable airspace control order or Air
   Tasking Order (ATO).
   6.56.7. Ground and in-flight checks of the Mode 4, when conducted, are mandatory
   maintenance debrief items. Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation of
   the Mode 4 on all aircraft forms (AFTO Form781A).
   6.56.8. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate the
   Mode 4 on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Before departing for any
   destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local COMSEC
   managers for guidance.
6.57. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects. Store only the minimum amount of
professional gear required to accomplish the mission on the flight deck. Additional items, to
include personal pubs bags, will be secured in the crew rest area or the cargo compartment. All
items will be secured before passing the combat entry point through the combat exit point.
6.58. Hung Flare Procedures. Conduct the following procedures after the live firing of
chaff/flares or the crew suspects aircraft battle damage:
   6.58.1. After landing, taxi to the de-arm area or another suitable safe location to check for
   hung ordnance.
       6.58.1.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Crews will clear all active runways prior to checking
       for a hung ordnance. Advise ATC a ―visual inspection‖ of the aircraft will be performed
       prior to entering the parking area.
   6.58.2. A loadmaster, pilot, or flying crew chief (if available) will deplane the aircraft and
   check all chaff/flare dispensers for hung flares or damage. NOTE: Flare squibs that fail to
   fire are not considered hung flares.
   6.58.3. If a hung flare is found, identified by a protruding or partially ejected flare cartridge,
   the aircraft will remain in a de-arm area until Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel
   meet the aircraft. The aircraft must remain in the designated safe area until EOD personnel
   can clear all hung flares.
       6.58.3.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Once a hung flare is confirmed, notify ATC and Dover
       Command Post. Request to proceed directly to the hot cargo pad. Provide the following
       information: aircraft location, type and quantity of flares that are hung, location of hung
 128                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


       flare (i.e. left nose, right gear, etc), type and quantity of any remaining flares, and total
       souls on board the aircraft. If possible, maintain a minimum separation of 600 feet from
       inhabited buildings and other aircraft.
   6.58.4. If a hung flare is not found, the aircraft can proceed to the parking location.
6.59. (Added-DOVERAFB) Aircrew Data Transfer Device (ADTD).
   6.59.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Do not make changes to any of the operating properties of
   the ADTD. Installing or running programs from a CD/DVD, Floppy Disk, PMCIA, thumb
   drive, or other media, not specifically authorized in the flight manual, is strictly prohibited.
   6.59.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) The floppy disk drive (A:) on the ADTD is damaged when
   dust covers on floppy disks get lodged inside. Do not use floppy disks with metal dust
   covers in the ADTD. Do not insert/force any sharp object into the floppy drive. If you
   cannot retrieve a disk, write-up the ADTD in the aircraft forms.
   6.59.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) Do not make an AFTO Form 781 write-up in the aircraft
   forms when the Norton Anti-virus information box appears on the ADTD stating the
   definition file is more than 30 days old. The 436 AW Site Service Representatives (SSR)
   will update these files in conjunction with WWNDB and TAWS updates.
   6.59.4. (Added-DOVERAFB) Aircraft with ADTDs that do not have floppy disk drives
   will store a removable floppy disk drive and a removable CD-ROM disk drive in the
   aircraft‘s gun box. These disk drives remain part of the aircraft‘s onboard equipment.
6.60. (Added-DOVERAFB) Local Operating and Noise Abatement Restrictions.
   6.60.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Runway 14/32 Operations.
       6.60.1.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Runway 14 may only be used to recover aircraft when
       crosswind and runway conditions prevent aircraft from landing on other runways.
       Runway 14 is normally used only for takeoffs.
   6.60.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Noise Abatement Procedures. Noise sensitive areas are
   depicted on wall maps in Base Operations. Additionally, refer to Figure 6.1 and the 436th
   OG, OI 11-10.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                          129

      6.60.2.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Maintain 3,000‘ MSL over the downtown Dover,
      Camden/Wyoming, Milford and Harrington areas.
      6.60.2.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Avoid over flight of the following historically
      significant buildings:
         6.60.2.2.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Dickinson Mansion located at approximately
         DOV 160/2 (N39 06 05.1 W075 26 54.7)
         6.60.2.2.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Round Barn located at approximately DOV

         6.60.2.2.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) The Manor at Cool Springs                   located
         approximately 5 NM southeast of Milton, DE (N38 43 12.0 W075 14 48.0)
      6.60.2.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) The following areas have historically generated the
      most Dover AFB noise complaints. C-17 crews may overfly these areas when executing
      VFR patterns. However, C-17 crews should plan low altitude tactical approaches and
      departures (below 1,000 feet) to avoid these areas to the maximum extent practical.

      6.60.2.4. (Added-DOVERAFB) VFR Traffic. C-17 VFR patterns operate east of the
      base. Light civilian VFR traffic operates west of the base.
         6.60.2.4.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) The overhead approach will be performed using
         a level turn from the break turn and descend from the overhead pattern altitude once
         turning base to final. This allows for a vertical separation between departing aircraft
         and those already established within the VFR pattern. Aircrews have the following
         options:
             6.60.2.4.1.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Maintain the overhead pattern altitude until
             the perch.
             6.60.2.4.1.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Request a descending break from tower.
             6.60.2.4.1.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) Request a descent to the normal VFR
             pattern once established on downwind with tower.
      6.60.2.5. (Added-DOVERAFB) Do not deviate from ATC assigned headings or
      altitudes without prior coordination. ATC instructions/directives take precedence over
      noise abatement procedures.
      6.60.2.6. (Added-DOVERAFB) Standard Climb Out Instructions:
         6.60.2.6.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Runway 01/19. Climb and maintain 3000‘ MSL,
         fly runway heading.
         6.60.2.6.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Runway 32. Climb and maintain 3000‘ MSL,
         turn right heading 360 at departure end at or above 400‘ AGL. Delay flap retraction
         until 2000‘ AGL or VFR pattern alt. For missed approach/T&GO, turn right 360
         prior to 0.8 DME. (NOTE: 400‘ AGL noise abatement altitude has priority over
         RWY 32 standard climb out if a/c cannot obtain 400‘ by dept end)
         6.60.2.6.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) Runway 14. Climb and maintain 3000‘ MSL, at
         departure end turn right heading 150.

                                            Chapter 7

                                   AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting
aircraft piracy (hijacking) of the C-17 aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft
Piracy (Hijacking), AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and specific
MAJCOM security publications contain additional guidance. Aircrews will not release
information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the
public.
7.2. Security. The C-17 is a ―Protection Level 3‖ resource. Aircraft security at non-United
States military installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency.
7.3. Integrated Defense. The following security procedures will implement AFI 31-101,
requirements for C-17 aircraft:
   7.3.1. The aircraft will be parked in an established restricted area and afforded protection
   IAW AFI 31-101.
   7.3.2. When no permanent or established restricted area parking space is available, establish
   a temporary restricted area consisting of a raised rope barrier, and post with restricted area
   signs. Portable security lighting will be provided during the hours of darkness if sufficient
   permanent lighting is not available. Post security forces IAW AFI 31-101.
   7.3.3. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local
   security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If he or she
   determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate
   security is available.
   7.3.4. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security force
   POC must be identified to the PIC.
   7.3.5. Security support is a continual requirement and is not negated by the presence of
   aircrew or ground crewmembers. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft
   doors are closed and the aircraft taxis.
7.4. Standby Aircraft Security. Ensure aircraft hatches and doors are secure to show
unauthorized entry. The PIC shall notify the C2 agency the aircraft is sealed and provide them a
means to access the aircraft in an emergency. Annotate the forms with the time the aircraft was
sealed. The C2 Senior Controller may grant access to a sealed aircraft, shall document time of
entry and ensure it remains launch capable. The PIC or designated representative must be
present if access to the aircraft is required and will ensure the aircraft is resealed. The aircrew
pre-preflight portion will remain valid if performed by one aircrew, sealed, and flown by another
aircrew. NOTE: WG/CCs should develop local procedures for documentation and management
IAW TO 00-20-1 and MAJCOM Supplement.
7.5. En route Security. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to
ensure adequate en route security is available. The PIC will receive a threat assessment and en
route security capability evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation prior to home station
 132                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


departure and should request updates from en route C2 as required. If required, a PHOENIX
RAVEN team will be assigned to the mission.
   7.5.1. The PHOENIX RAVEN team will consist of a minimum of three US Air Force
   security force members, but may include more depending on security requirements. The
   team's travel status is determined by MAJCOM. The team travels in MEP status and is
   responsible to the PIC at all times. In turn, the PIC is responsible for the team‘s welfare
   (transportation, lodging, etc.). Ensure security team members receive a mission briefing and
   aircraft egress/passenger briefing (as appropriate).
   7.5.2. Arrival. On arrival, the PIC will assess the local situation and take the following
   actions as required:
       7.5.2.1. Area patrol. Request area security patrols from local security forces. If local
       authorities request payment for this service, use AF Form 15 United States Air Force
       Invoice.
       7.5.2.2. Aircrew surveillance. During short ground times, direct armed crewmembers to
       remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in
       the aircraft vicinity.
       7.5.2.3. Inadequate Security. If, in the opinion of the PIC, airfield security is inadequate
       and the PIC determines the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the
       FDP limits and crew rest requirements and depart as soon as possible for a base
       considered reliable. Report movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon
       as practical. If a departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best
       of their ability. In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest
       requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.
       The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft
       protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request security assistance from the
       nearest DoD installation, US Embassy, local military or law enforcement agencies as
       appropriate.
   7.5.3. Entry Control Procedures. Unescorted entry is granted to aircrew members and
   support personnel assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199,
   Air Force Entry Control Card, supported by an Entry Access List (EAL) or aircrew orders.
   Aircrew members and assigned crew chiefs are authorized escort authority.
       7.5.3.1. Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their
       duties under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
       7.5.3.2. Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area.
7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
   7.6.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed
   to allow ground personnel immediate access. If, in the PIC‘s judgment, the aircraft needs to
   be sealed in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
       7.6.1.1. Use available aircraft ground security locking devices (i.e. box car seals/cargo
       straps on troop doors and escape hatch).
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                    133


       7.6.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape
       inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
       7.6.1.3. Close and seal the crew entrance door (box car seal). Confirm the condition of
       the aft hatch seal. (See paragraph 7.6.3)
       7.6.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of
       a forced entry.
       7.6.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the Office of Special
       Investigation (OSI), security forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency. Have aircraft
       thoroughly inspected prior to flight.
   7.6.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   During pre-flight activities, aircrews will inspect accessible areas, to include aircraft wheel
   wells, air conditioning compartments, and cargo compartment under floor area (IAW 7.6.3)
   for unauthorized packages, personnel, or other unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious
   items to host security forces. Aircrews will maintain a heightened security posture
   throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
   7.6.3. Under floor Hatch Security. The following procedures are to be used when inspecting/
   securing the under floor maintenance area. Crewmembers will not enter the under floor area
   unless specifically required for the mission. Crewmembers will not pin the aft hatch from
   inside the aircraft. Prior to all home station departures, crewmembers will ensure both the
   forward and aft under floor maintenance tunnel access hatches are sealed. If the aft hatch is
   not sealed, open the aft hatch and visually inspect the under floor area from the aft hatch.
   Close and seal the aft hatch (tape, boxcar seal, or suitable alternate) and ensure the forward
   hatch is secured with a boxcar seal. Enter the date, time and initials of the individual
   accomplishing these procedures on the tape (if used). Annotate the aircraft forms with the
   method sealed, (tape or seal), the seal number if applicable, date and time. Prior to each off
   station flight, the loadmaster will check the forward hatch seal and the pilot will inspect aft
   hatch seal during the exterior inspection. Verify the tape/seal on the aft hatch is intact, does
   not allow opening, and agrees with the write up in the aircraft forms. If the seal/tape has been
   removed/tampered with, notify security personnel immediately. Prior to entering crew rest,
   check the condition of the seal/tape and reapply if necessary. Local missions: no
   inspection/seal is required for either hatch.
7.7. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When a C-17 is operating away
from home station, the PIC will comply with this chapter and AFI 13-207, as supplemented.
   7.7.1. Preventive measures include the following: The host station passenger processing or
   manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers until
   the PIC is fully satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of qualified passenger
   service representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and
   baggage is accomplished.
   7.7.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients.
   When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform
   required inspections prior to loading.
 134                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   7.7.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the
   movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers
   and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.7.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried
   baggage aboard an aircraft. EXECPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or
   State Department, RAVEN Team Members, and other individuals specifically authorized to
   carry weapons.
       7.7.4.1. Troops or MEP crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an
       aircraft. They will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may carry unloaded
       weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations. When the
       tactical situation dictates (in coordination with the aircrew), weapons may be loaded at
       the order of the troop commander or team leader.
       7.7.4.2. Dummy clips that can be easily identified may be loaded for training at the order
       of the team leader in coordination with the aircrew.
       7.7.4.3. RAVENs will only be armed in-flight on specifically designated missions
       identified on the mission ―FRAG‖ as ―RAVEN in-flight arming required‖.
   7.7.5. If weapons must be cleared, instruct the individual(s) to:
       7.7.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
       personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging their weapons.
       7.7.5.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures. Ensure troop/PIC
       retains ammunition IAW paragraph 7.7.4.1
7.8. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
   7.8.1. The Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has exclusive
   responsibility to direct law enforcement activity related to actual or attempted aircraft piracy
   (hijacking) in the United States. See CJCSI 3610.01A, dated 20 Jun 06, and 49 USC 46501
   and 49 USC 44903(e).
   7.8.2. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.8.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or
   weapons of mass destruction, DoD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with all pertinent information. Where possible, the FAA will
   consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.8.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
   7.8.5. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.8.6. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                    135


   7.8.7. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may
   be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the
   hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.8.8. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
   7.8.9. In the case of an aircraft carrying passengers, the primary concern is the safety of the
   passengers.
   7.8.10. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested
   by the pilot in command of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the
   anti-hijacking effort.
7.9. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft
within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time
as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple dissuasion, through deception and subterfuge, to
direct physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
   7.9.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened,
   while the aircraft is on the ground:
       7.9.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the
       aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
       7.9.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is
       vested in the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot
       be established, or when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following
       order:
           7.9.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
           7.9.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose AOR the airfield lies.
           7.9.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
           7.9.1.2.4. PIC in compliance with MAJCOM directives.
   7.9.2. A hijacked aircraft carrying weapons of mass destruction will not be allowed to
   takeoff. Refer to DoD 5210.41M, Nuclear Weapon Security Manual, paragraph 9B(3), for
   additional guidance.
7.10. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the
resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific
counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the
aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material
onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may consider are:
   7.10.1. Engage the hijacker(s) in conversation in an attempt to calm them and to evaluate
   what course of action might be effective.
   7.10.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
 136                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   7.10.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
   7.10.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a
   hostile, country.
   7.10.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
   physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking
threat will transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. If an in-the-clear
transmission is not possible, set transponder to 7500. If unable to set transponder, or if not under
radar control, transmit a radio message indicating transponder change to 7500. Notify ground
agencies by any means available as soon as practical and follow-up with situation reports as
circumstances permit. Covert signals are no longer to be used per FAA guidance.
7.12. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. Refer to FIH for international signals for
air intercept.
   7.12.1. PICs will immediately report all uncoordinated aircraft interceptions to TACC via
   the most expeditious means available (UHF/VHF, AERO-I, HF, AOC, etc.) after complying
   with guidance in the FIH. Consideration will be given to phase of flight (descent/
   approach/landing) and aircraft emergencies. When an airborne report is not accomplished,
   PICs must directly notify TACC upon landing. In all cases, ensure local C2 and intel
   agencies are informed.
7.13. Arming of Crewmembers. Crews will arm IAW mission directive (Form 59, SPINS,
OPORD, etc.). Unless otherwise directed, one pilot and one loadmaster will be armed. Aircraft
commander will identify which crewmembers will arm. The following procedures apply when
arming is directed:
   7.13.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, obtain weapons, ammunition, box,
   lock and key. Crewmembers will be armed according to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of
   Force by Air Force Personnel and MAJCOM publications. Crews will arm with hollow-
   point ammunition anytime while armed in the aircraft. If a crewmember leaves the aircraft,
   they must only use ammunition approved/directed per regional guidance (SPINs, OPORD,
   FCG, etc). If an armed crew member must leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to
   another authorized crew member using AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
       7.13.1.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) When directed to arm, aircrews on missions
       originating from Dover will send 2 crewmembers to jet-side service and pick up weapons
       prior to going to the aircraft. EXCEPTION: If jet-side service is unavailable,
       crewmembers will send 2 crewmembers to the Armory to pick up weapons prior to going
       to the aircraft. If arrangements have been made with Armory personnel, then only one
       crewmember may pick up the weapons. Aircrew will not transport government issued
       weapons in POVs.
   7.13.2. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to prevent
   identifying armed crewmembers. Crewmembers will be armed before beginning preflight,
   onload or offload duties, and until completion of all post-flight duties. Do not wear weapons
   off the flight line except to and from the C2, armories, and other facilities associated with
   aircrew activities.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                              137


     7.13.2.1. Upon initiation of the Combat Entry Checklist, crewmembers armed for anti-
     hijacking requirements may transfer their weapon from their concealed holster to the
     survival vest holster or to a holster worn outside/over combat/survival gear. At the
     Combat Exit checklist, transfer the weapon back to the concealed holster.
     7.13.2.2. AMC Passenger Terminal Procedures. Armed crewmembers must discreetly
     identify themselves to AMC passenger service personnel upon arrival at security
     checkpoints. One crewmember will present a valid set of crew orders, their military
     identification card, and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, authorizing
     the carrying of concealed weapons. Once terminal personnel verify this, they will allow
     the crewmember to vouch for the remaining crewmembers. The entire crew will then
     proceed through the magnetometer without removing objects from their pockets. This
     will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are armed.
  7.13.3. Weapons Storage In-Flight. When passengers are not onboard, weapons may be
  stored in the gun box in-flight after a satisfactory stowaway check. Crewmembers will rearm
  before landing. Weapons will not be unloaded before placing them in a gun box.
  7.13.4. Weapons Storage on the Ground.
     7.13.4.1. Aircrews will store weapons and ammunition in the most secure facility
     available, normally the base armory.
     7.13.4.2. In the event a secure facility is unavailable:
     7.13.4.2.1. Non-stage aircrews may store weapons and ammunition in the aircraft gun
     box.
     7.13.4.2.2. Stage aircrews should contact C2 for guidance.
  7.13.5. When storing weapons in the gun box:
     7.13.5.1. Weapons should not normally be unloaded.
     7.13.5.2. Inform C2 which crew member has the gun box key.
  7.13.6. Crewmembers will ensure they are reissued the same weapon until mission
  termination at home station.
  7.13.7. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
  barrels if available. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another crew
  member; place the weapon on a flat surface.
     7.13.7.1. PIC will visually verify with the designated armed crew members that they are
     armed, and the weapons container is accounted for, prior to releasing transportation.
     7.13.7.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) If a suitable clearing barrel is not available, move to a
     safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or personnel before un-
     holstering or un-slinging weapons. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety
     procedures.
  7.13.8. (Added-DOVERAFB) Standard Anti-Hijacking: designated crewmembers are
  issued one magazine per weapon with 15 rounds of hollow point ammunition. For easy
  identification, the butt end of hollow point ammunition magazines should be painted red.
  Hollow point ammunition can only be used for anti-hijacking purposes.
 138                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


       7.13.8.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Once a crewmember is not protecting the aircraft from
       being hijacked, hollow point ammunition is not authorized. It is a violation of LOAC and
       the Geneva Convention to use hollow point ammunition in armed conflict.
       Crewmembers must change to ball type ammunition when switching from an anti-
       hijacking role (in and around the aircraft) to a Force Protection role (when not in the
       immediate vicinity of the aircraft). The butt end of ball ammunition magazines should be
       unpainted or painted green.
7.14. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times.

          8.4.1.1.12. A lasing incident. NOTE: Crewmembers and passengers involved in a
          physiological episode will see a flight surgeon as soon as practical. If direct eye
          exposure to laser energy is received but no visual disturbance is experienced, report to
          the nearest flight surgeon as soon as possible. If symptoms of visual disturbance after
          exposure to laser energy are experienced, report immediately to the nearest
          emergency room.
       8.4.1.2. A human factors related situation, e.g. misinterpretation of instruments;
       information overload (i.e. tactile, aural, and visual input too fast to permit reasonable
       analysis/decision); aircrew task saturation (i.e. too many responses/actions required in a
       short period of time); or confused switchology (i.e. adjacent switches where actuation of
       wrong switch creates dangerous situation). Anonymous reports are acceptable.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                   141

  8.5.6. PICs shall expeditiously report unusual events/circumstances that impact their mission
  to appropriate MAJCOM agencies. Reportable events include, but are not limited to,
  spectrum interference, interception, fuel dumping, multiple engine failure, hostile fire, injury
  to passenger or aircrew member, etc. This list is not all exhaustive. Most events require C2
  agents to forward OPREP reports to higher headquarters. In all cases, pass the ―who, what,
  when, where, why, and how‖ of the incident to a C2 agency.
     8.5.6.1. The Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, covered in AFI 10-707,
     Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, establishes procedures to combat the effect
     of meaconing, intrusion, jamming, and interference.               PICs who encounter
     electromagnetic interference (EMI) will report the event to the nearest C2 agency as soon
     as practical.
         8.5.6.1.1. Address EMI reports to: HQ AMC SCOTT AFB IL//A63// and addressees
         listed in AFI 10-707. Send reports via electronic message format with the following
         information in plain text:
             8.5.6.1.1.1. Frequency selected when EMI occurred.
             8.5.6.1.1.2. Equipment affected by EMI. Location of the system. The system
             function, name, nomenclature, manufacturer with model number or other system
             description. The operating mode of the system, if applicable (frequency agile,
             pulse doppler, search, etc.).
             8.5.6.1.1.3. Description of EMI (noise, pulsed, continuous, intermittent, on so
             forth).
             8.5.6.1.1.4. Effect EMI had on system performance (reduced range, false targets,
             reduced intelligibility, data errors, etc.).
             8.5.6.1.1.5. Date(s) and time(s) of EMI.
             8.5.6.1.1.6. Location where EMI occurred (coordinates or line of bearing, if
             known, otherwise state as unknown.)
             8.5.6.1.1.7. Source of the EMI if known.
             8.5.6.1.1.8. List other units that received interference (if known) and their
             location or distance and bearing from your location.
             8.5.6.1.1.9. A clear, concise narrative summary on what you know about the
             EMI, with any actions taken to resolve the problem.
             8.5.6.1.1.10. Whether or not PIC wants expert/technical assistance (include level
             of security clearance expert requires).
             8.5.6.1.1.11. Specify impact the EMI had on your mission.
             8.5.6.1.1.12. Provide a POC (Name, Rank, DSN/Commercial Phone Number,
             and Duty hours).
         8.5.6.1.2. C2 agents must prepare an OPREP-3 if EMI is suspected meaconing,
         intrusion, or jamming, interference sufficient to cause a hazard, or if, in the PIC‘s
         judgment, the situation warrants such a report.
 144                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


           8.5.6.1.3. PICs shall serve as classification authority for EMI reports. Evaluate an
           adversaries‘ ability to exploit certain systems using EMI and protect information
           accordingly. PICs on a non-sensitive mission or who judge the EMI to be
           interference from a non-hostile source need not classify EMI reports unless that report
           would reveal system vulnerability. Classify interference report(s) at stations located
           in combat areas or during sensitive military missions.
8.6. Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) - Aviation Fuels Documentation. This section
prescribes aviation POL (AVPOL) procedures that ensure correct documentation, form and
invoice processing, and program supervision. Use the Multi Service Corporation (MSC) air card
for the purchase of aviation fuel and ancillary ground services at commercial airports (and some
military installations) worldwide. The air card is authorized for use by all U.S. government
aircraft, state, and local law enforcement aircraft, and some foreign government aircraft. All
PICs should plan to use the ―platinum‖ MSC card. In most cases, there will be no changes when
refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract locations. The MSC card is
accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide. A list of all MSC-accepting merchants
can be found at https://www.airseacard.com. It replaces the Standard Form (SF) 44, Purchase
Order-Invoice-Voucher, at locations that accept the MSC card.
   8.6.1. Responsibilities. Aircrew and maintenance personnel will be familiar with AVPOL
   procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter. Improper use of the MSC card
   could create financial liability for the purchaser.
   8.6.2. Refuel/defuel USAF aircraft at DoD locations whenever possible. If DoD service is
   not available, purchase fuel from other source(s) in the following priority:
       8.6.2.1. Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) or Canadian into-plane contracts.
       8.6.2.2. Foreign government air forces. NOTE:          DoD FLIP en route supplements
       identify locations with into-plane contracts.
   8.6.3. AVPOL Forms Documentation and Procedures.
       8.6.3.1. The DD1898, Fuel Sale Slip, is the fuel transaction receipt used for purchases at
       other DoD locations, including DFSC into-plane contract locations. Log and place the
       DD1898 inside the AF Form 664. The PIC or designated representative shall complete
       this form. NOTE: If the contractor insists on a unique invoice along with the DD1898,
       annotate the vendor‘s invoice with ―DUPLICATE DD1898 ACCOMPLISHED.‖
       8.6.3.2. The AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documenting Log, is a tool to log and store all
       AVPOL transaction forms. Record all off-station transactions on the front of the form
       and insert the original form inside the envelope. Turn in the AF Form 664, with
       supporting forms, to maintenance debriefing or as directed by local procedures. The PIC
       or designated representative shall complete this form when appropriate.
       8.6.3.3. The SF 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, may be used to purchase fuel,
       ground services and/or other authorized products when no MSC card contract is in place.

        GOAT)
 NOTE: These restrictions do not apply to operational missions.


9.12. Maintenance Opportune Training.
   9.12.1. All aircraft in the en route system on AMC missions are available for opportune
   training except those designated non-available in the advisory section of GDSS Form 59 by
   the 18 AF/TACC (i.e. SAAM, 1A1, Phoenix Banner, and Medevac missions). Mission
   planners will annotate the GDSS Form 59 for those missions not allowed to be used for
   opportune training. The en route maintenance production supervisor will brief the aircraft
   commander of the intention to train, either at the aircraft or at the air mobility command
   center, prior to entering crew rest. If a conflict arises between the crew and en route
   maintenance teams it should be routed through TACC duty officer/operations director for
   resolution. NOTE: Aircraft Commander approval is not required.
   9.12.2. Training will not be performed on aircraft carrying hot cargo or on CLOSE WATCH
   missions. All training will be complete and the aircraft ready for flight not later than 2 hours
   prior to crew show. Crews are not required to remain with the aircraft while training is
   performed.
   9.12.3. Use of non-AMC aircraft will be supported on a pre-coordinated basis. The en route
   unit POC will coordinate with the owning wing command post to obtain permission to utilize
   the aircraft for training purposes.
9.13. (Added-DOVERAFB) Combat Offload Training.
   9.13.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Combat offload training will normally be accomplished at
   Dover AFB. Crews should use taxiway Charlie as the primary combat offload area and
   taxiway Echo is the secondary. Other areas require OGV approval before use.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                             153


   9.13.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) 30 minutes prior to the event, advise Command Post of
   planned offload operations.
   9.13.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) Primary Location: Taxiway Charlie. Obtain taxi clearance
   to the selected combat offload location from ground control. ATC shall not allow non-
   participating aircraft to use Charlie taxiway, Bravo taxiway north, and Runway 1/19 for
   departures/landings during the actual combat offload. Aircraft will request approval from
   Ground Control prior to commencing the procedure and advise once offload is complete.
      9.13.3.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Combat offloads on taxiway Charlie will be
      accomplished with the nose of the aircraft facing to the west (towards the main ramp).
      9.13.3.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Do not drop combat offload pallets on taxiway Bravo.
      To provide 1,500‘ for combat offloads, commence the combat offload no later than the
      aircraft ramp abeam the entrance to the compass rose (see Figure 9.1). Unless
      specifically cleared otherwise, complete the offload prior to entering runway 14/32.
   9.13.4. (Added-DOVERAFB) Secondary Location: Taxiway Echo. Obtain taxi clearance
   to the selected combat offload location from ground control. To provide 1,500‘ for combat
   offloads, commence the combat offload no later than the marked combat offload signs abeam
   the taxiway (see Figure 9.2). Aircraft will request approval from Ground Control prior to
   commencing the procedure and advise once offload is complete.
      9.13.4.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) The following guidance applies to Taxiway Echo
      combat offloads:
          9.13.4.1.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Per the Airfield Manager and pavement engineer
          assessment, the aircraft must be below 545K
          9.13.4.1.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) FOD potential is greater on Echo; therefore
          backing operations are prohibited on this Taxiway.

Figure 9.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Combat Offload on Taxiway Echo (Facing East)




   9.13.5. (Added-DOVERAFB) Off-station combat offloads will follow locally published
   guidance for the location conducting the training. PICs must thoroughly study the
   procedures and coordinate requirements at the off-station location.
   9.13.6. (Added-DOVERAFB) Combat Offload Malfunctions. A malfunction is any
   complete or partial failure of any portion of the ADS or logistics rail system, or the failure of
   any piece of equipment or rigging to function as designed. Comply with appropriate
   technical orders and MAJCOM directives. If a Combat Offload malfunction occurs abort the
   mission. Notify command post and request that Ops Group Stan/Eval, maintenance, and
   Safety representatives meet the aircraft immediately. Do not de-rig the ADS or Logistic Rail
   System and ensure maintenance personnel do not tamper with the system until all
   representatives arrive at the aircraft.
9.14. (Added-DOVERAFB) Aircraft Backing Training at Dover AFB. Crews should avoid
conducting backing training on asphalt surfaces to the maximum extent possible. Crews will
advise ATC prior to conducting any backing training.
9.15. (Added-DOVERAFB) Command and Control.
   9.15.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Training priorities for local training missions will be
   established through the daily scheduling process. Exceptions will be coordinated through the
   Command Post DO and resolved by the 436/512 OG/CCs.
   9.15.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Local training sorties may be terminated prior to scheduled
   duration if training is complete. Coordinate early termination or mission cancellation with
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  155


   squadron CC or DO (436 AW) or 512 OG/CC or on call OG Staff Officer (512 AW) through
   Dover Command Post.
   9.15.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) PICs will obtain approval from appropriate OG/CC through
   coordination with Command Post if they wish to continue flying past scheduled sortie
   duration.
   9.15.4. (Added-DOVERAFB) Call Dover Command Post with an estimated block time and
   maintenance status, not later than 30 minutes prior to blocks.
   9.15.5. (Added-DOVERAFB) Upon termination of all training missions, relay the
   following information to Dover Command Post: maintenance status, flight hours, fuel
   remaining, AR offload received, training % complete.
   9.15.6. (Added-DOVERAFB) If canceling an off-station training reservation (e.g.,
   Blackstone AAF, Maxfield Field NAS, or North Field block time), specifically request
   Command Post to relay the information to the applicable agency.
9.16. (Added-DOVERAFB) Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC).
   9.16.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) ERCC Area. The primary ERCC location is on taxiway A
   between taxiway B and D. The aircraft will face east abeam parking spot B3. The secondary
   ERCC location is on taxiway C between taxiway A and runway 14/32. The aircraft will face
   west.
   9.16.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) ERCC Reference Line. White reference lines are painted on
   the left side of Taxiways Alpha and Charlie. Although these lines were painted as C-5
   references, C-17s will park when abeam this line to ensure taxiing aircraft have adequate tail
   clearance.
   9.16.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) The inbound loadmaster will perform ground duties (be on
   headset/interphone and positioned in front of the aircraft). The outbound loadmaster will
   assume ground duties and receive a face to face briefing from the inbound loadmaster on
   preflight status and cargo load information. The inbound loadmaster will complete weight
   and balance computations (365-4 Form F) for the outbound crew. The loadmaster will
   ensure all personnel remain clear of danger areas while boarding the aircraft. Inbound PIC
   will brief outbound PIC on aircraft status and leave navigation kits on the aircraft. The
   Inbound PIC will ensure all aircraft forms (e.g., 781 and 664) are complete for the inbound
   sortie prior to departing the aircraft. If ERCC is performed in a designated parking spot,
   crews will coordinate with Command Post for marshallers and wing walkers.
9.17. (Added-DOVERAFB) Transition Training. Dover crews may conduct training at
routine use airfields ―Familiar Fields‖, as depicted in the 436th OG, OI 11-10. Any location not
listed in the 436th OG OI 11-10 requires OG/CC or OG/CD approval. Additionally, crews
should review Form 59 and/or Daily Flying Schedule for any restrictions to multiple practice
approaches at locations other than home station.

9.18. (Added-DOVERAFB) Local Training Termination.
   9.18.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Local training flights will terminate at 2200L (extended
   until 2300L during BASH Phase II) unless approved by 436th OG/CC or 512th OG/CC.
   EXCEPTION: Aircraft on the local flying schedule are considered approved by the OG/CC.
   AAR and off-station training missions are exempt from quiet hours. Unless prior
   coordination is accomplished with CP, ATC will only approve one approach to a full stop for
   the following: aircraft not on the local flying schedule, aircraft returning from Air to Air
   Refueling (AAR), or off-station training missions.

                                           Chapter 10

  AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND
                 NUCLEAR THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)
weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security threats to the global operations
of air mobility forces. This chapter describes the CBRN threat, passive defense measures to
mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight operations in a contaminated
environment.
10.2. Understanding the CBRN Threat.
   10.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister,
   choking, and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on
   your side. The ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates
   of chemicals all decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or
   absorb into surfaces. For decontamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5
   percent bleach solution currently appears to be the best and most practical method of
   removing chemical agents that may remain as a contact hazard on glass, and unpainted metal.
   Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is soap and water. NOTE:
   Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed chemical warfare
   agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and vapor hazards.
   10.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into
   three areas: bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally
   susceptible to antibiotics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms
   or plants; and viruses (i.e., Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive
   and reproduce. Viruses and toxins do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the
   medical community would be the first to recognize that an upsurge in ―flu-like symptoms‖ is
   actually a bio attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV rays, humidity and high/low
   temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life, lasting decades under
   the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help prevent
   infection.
   10.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called ―dirty
   bomb,‖ is the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive
   material without using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and
   distance are the best defenses against radiation exposure.
   10.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat,
   initial radiation, and residual fallout. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a
   nuclear detonation can damage electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of
   shielding, distance from the blast, and limited time of exposure.
10.3. CBRN Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities
conducted to negate, contain, and manage the effects of CBRN attack. Passive defense measures
include pre, trans, and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRN threat through
contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control.
158                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


  10.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive
  defense measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include: inflight diversion,
  survival launch, and minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, aerospace ground
  equipment (AGE), and material handling equipment (MHE).
      10.3.1.1. Inflight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRN
      attack or has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if
      at all possible. Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the
      controlling OPORD
      10.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every
      reasonable effort will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances,
      aircrew may launch to survive if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to
      the runway. In practice, this option may only be practical for aircraft that have just
      landed or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If launch is not possible, shut down
      engines and avoid running environmental control systems.                   Close aircraft
      doors/hatches/ramps, don Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal
      protective cover on the base. If time does not permit using base facilities, and the attack
      is a missile attack, remain in the sealed aircraft for a minimum of one-hour after the
      attack and/or follow host-base guidance.
      10.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly
      contaminated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance
      and the use of protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly
      contaminated cargo requires special precautions and must be specifically authorized by
      the senior transportation commander.
  10.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided,
  protection provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRN environment.
  Protection is afforded by individual protective equipment, collective protection, and
  hardening of facilities.
      10.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. The current in-flight protective gear for
      aircrew members is the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE). The ACDE
      includes the newer Aircrew Eye-Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) above the
      shoulders and the CWU-66/P or CWU-77/P Integrated Aircrew Chemical Coverall
      (IACC). The Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) consists of the protective mask, C2 series
      canister (or filter element for MCU-2A/P protective mask), and over garment, boots, and
      gloves. The ACDE and GCE provide protection against chemical and biological agents.
      They do not provide blast or radiation protection from an RDD or nuclear detonation.
      The ACDE requires care during donning using "buddy dressing" procedures and Aircrew
      Flight Equipment (AFE) expertise during processing through the Aircrew Contamination
      Control Area (ACCA). (NOTE: AECMs will utilize the MCU-2A series mask).
         10.3.2.1.1. ACDE/GCE Issue. Aircrews will be issued sized ACDE and GCE at
         home station. Aircrews will ensure their ACDE and GCE are available at all times
         while in a CBRN threat area. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag
         contents and correct sizes.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  159


         10.3.2.1.2. ACDE Wear During Ground Operations. Because aircraft contamination
         is unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations represent the highest threat to
         aircrew safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid chemical agents
         is paramount. Aircrew should limit activities to essential duties only, and separate
         ground duties from air duties.
         10.3.2.1.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) When required to carry the Aircrew Chemical
         Defense Ensemble (ACDE), the squadron will fax a copy of crew orders to Aircrew
         Flight Equipment after the crew list is established. Squadrons should specify whether
         mini or full D-Bags are required.
     10.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled,
     contamination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE
     such as the ACDE. The basic concept for most facility collective protective solutions is
     to employ overpressure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit. The intent is to provide rest
     and relief accommodations, as well as provide medical treatment in contamination free
     zone. Crewmembers should avail themselves of facilities, if provided, on the airfield.
     10.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to
     strengthen buildings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To
     reduce the potential of vapor exposure in facilities without collective protection; seal
     windows and doors, turn off HVAC systems, and use room above the first floor when
     possible.
  10.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control
  measures limit the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through
  disease prevention measures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations.
  Effective contamination control helps sustain air mobility operations by minimizing
  performance degradation, casualties, or loss of material.
     10.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene
     practices, and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive
     measures.
     10.3.3.2. Decontamination.
         10.3.3.2.1. Inflight Decontamination. Air washing is a useful inflight
         decontamination technique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal
         surfaces. However, vapor hazards may remain in areas where the airflow
         characteristics prevent complete off-gassing (i.e., wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and
         screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower
         altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes. Fly with the aircraft configured
         (gear, flaps, and slats extended) as long as possible to maximize the airflow in and
         around as many places as possible. Be advised that exterior contamination may seep
         into the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews. Use of ACDE is
         recommended. Refer to Smoke and Fumes in the Aircraft checklist procedures to
         help purge interior contamination.
         10.3.3.2.2. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and
         equipment may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated
 160                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


           assets will be restricted to DOD-controlled airfields and not released from US
           government control.
       10.3.3.3. Exchange Zone (EZ) Operations. The AMC Concept for Air Mobility
       Operations in a Chemical and Biological Environment (CB CONOPS) describes a
       method for continuing the vital flow of personnel into a contaminated airfield while
       limiting the number of air mobility aircraft and personnel exposed to the contaminated
       environment. The purpose of the EZ is to minimize the spread of contamination within
       the air mobility fleet, preserving as many aircraft as possible for unrestricted international
       flight. The EZ is an area (located at uncontaminated airfield) set aside to facilitate the
       exchange of uncontaminated (clean) cargo/passengers to a contaminated (dirty) airframe,
       or vice versa, without cross-contamination. Additional information on the EZ is available
       through HQ AMC/A3X.
10.4. Flight Operations.
10.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of CBRN
weapons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should emphasize
ACDE wear, crew coordination, CBRN hazards and countermeasures, inflight diversion, plans
for onload/offload in the event of a ground attack, and plans for the return leg in the event of
aircraft contamination. Alternative scenario plans should also be considered in the event MOPP
conditions change.
   10.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control
   channels to ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination's alert
   condition. Diversion of aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless
   operational necessity otherwise dictates. The 618 AOC (TACC) or theater C2 agency
   (normally through the controlling OPORD) will direct aircrew pre-exposure activities such as
   medical pre-treatment for chemical/biological exposure or issue of dosimetry for potential
   radiological hazards.
   10.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions
   as the result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized.
   Although the aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot,
   thus restricting the aircraft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
   10.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen
   requirements. Aircrew wear of ACDE will require use of the aircraft oxygen system to
   counter actual/suspected contamination. Using the 100 percent oxygen setting offers the
   greatest protection in a contaminated environment. Appropriate oxygen reservoir levels must
   be planned to meet higher consumption rates. Use the aircraft Dash 1 charts to calculate the
   required reservoir levels.
   10.4.5. Donning Equipment. Aircrew will don ACDE based on the alarm condition (See
   Airman‘s Manual (AFMAN 10-100). Use the "buddy dressing" procedures, and refer to
   AMCVA 11-303, AERP Donning Checklist and AMCVA 11-304, ACDE Donning Checklist,
   to ensure proper wear. When wearing the ACDE, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto
   injectors will be kept in the upper left ACDE pocket. If the integrated survival vest/body
   armor is worn, the Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors may be kept in the lower
   right flight suit pocket. This standardized location will enable personnel to locate the
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                      161


   medication should an individual be overcome by CWA poisoning. M-9 paper on the flight
   suit will facilitate detection of liquid chemical agents and ACCA processing. M-9 paper
   should be placed on the flight suit prior to entering the CBRN threat area or when an alarm
   ―yellow‖ or higher has been declared. When inbound to a CBRN threat area, prior to
   descent, the aircraft commander will ensure crew and passengers don appropriate protective
   equipment IAW arrival destination's MOPP level and brief aircrew operations in the CBRN
   threat area. As a minimum, this briefing will include: flight deck isolation, oxygen
   requirements, air conditioning system requirements, IPE requirements, ground operations,
   and MOPP levels. Aircrew members must determine if the wear of the integrated survival
   vest/body armor and LPUs will restrict dexterity and mobility to the point that it becomes a
   safety issue. If the aircrew deems the equipment to create a safety of flight concern, then the
   items may be pre-positioned (instead of worn) on the aircraft to be readily available to the
   aircrew.
   10.4.6. Communicating Down-Line Support. Pass aircraft and cargo contamination
   information through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be
   used to determine if a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed.
   Report the physical condition of any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and
   whether they are wearing chemical defense ensembles.
10.5. Ground Operations.
   10.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a
   contaminated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-
   flight crews are not available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to
   entering crew rest. The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-
   flight briefings. Then, they will report to the ACCA for processing and ACDE donning with
   assistance from ALS personnel. If possible, aircrew transport should be provided in a
   covered vehicle. Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to departure to
   prevent contamination spread to them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they
   will require assistance from ground support personnel in removing their aircrew protective
   overcape and overboots prior to entering the aircraft.
   10.5.2. Onload and Offload Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent
   contamination spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the
   flight deck area. Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine
   covers, safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic
   bags and properly marked IAW technical order requirements. Aircrew members entering the
   aircraft will remove plastic overboots and overcape portions of the aircrew ensemble and
   ensure flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and placed in clean plastic bags. Prior to
   entering the aircraft all personnel should implement boot wash/decontamination procedures.
   Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated environment will don plastic overboots and
   overcape prior to leaving the aircraft.
   10.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete
   ACDE, complicates communications capability. Use the mini-amplifier/speaker or the
   aircraft public address system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as required.
   10.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from
   a contaminated to an uncontaminated airbase. Critical requirements are pre-designated in
 162                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   theater war plans. Onload cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the
   aircraft. If contaminated, protective cover(s) will be removed/replaced just prior to placing
   the cargo on the aircraft. It is the user's responsibility to decontaminate cargo for air
   shipment. The airlift of contaminated or formerly contaminated cargo requires the approval
   of the senior transportation commander.
   10.5.5. Passenger/Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and the
   ground transportation vehicle to reduce interior contamination when loading/unloading
   passengers/patients. Normally, externally contaminated patients and those infected with
   contagious biological agents will not be transported onboard AMC or AMC-procured
   aircraft. The AMC/CC is the waiver authority to this policy. (NOTE: An altitude below
   10,000 feet is recommended due to AECM use of the ground chemical mask.)
   10.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems
   resulting from physical exertion while wearing ACDE. The aircraft commander should
   consider factors such as ground time, temperature and remaining mission requirements when
   determining on/offload capabilities. Individuals involved should be closely monitored for
   adverse physiological effects.
   10.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize
   thermal stress caused by wearing the ACDE. Aircrews must weigh all factors when
   performing in-flight and ground duties. The following are degradation factors for wearing
   full GCE, and may also be used to represent the Task Time Multipliers for the ACDE. A
   more extensive discussion of this subject is found in AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear, Biological,
   Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards.

NOTES:
1. If wearing MOPP 4, add 10ºF to Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT). If wearing
personal body armor in humid climates, add 5ºF to WBGT.
2. Rest means minimal physical activity (sitting or standing), accomplished in shade if possible.
3. CAUTION: Daily fluid intake should not exceed 12 quarts. Hourly fluid intake should not
exceed 1 quart. The work/rest time and fluid replacement volumes will sustain performance
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                     163


and hydration for at least 4 hours of work in the specified work category. Individual water
needs will vary ±¼ quart/ hour.
4. NL=no limit to work time per hour.
   10.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with
   actual/suspected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke
   and Fume Elimination procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close
   inspection of aircrew, passenger ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9
   detection paper. Detection paper only detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor
   hazards. Above the shoulder ACDE should only be removed if there is absolutely no vapor
   hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the detectable levels of currently
   fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed space. The aircrew must take
   every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants, especially on the flight deck
   area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid those areas for the
   remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo compartments cool. If an aircrew member or
   passenger has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel aboard the aircraft will
   stay in full ACDE/GCE until processed through their respective contamination control area
   (CCA). Upon arrival, the contaminated aircraft will be parked in an isolated area and
   cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground personnel.
   10.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an
   aerospace vehicle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological,
   biological or chemical contaminant, a Red X will be entered and an annotation will be made
   in historical records for the lifecycle of the equipment.
   10.5.10. 10-Foot Rule. The 10-foot rule was developed in order to provide guidance for
   protecting personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in
   locations with materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 10-foot rule embodies a
   safety factor that goes beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE
   whenever detectors no longer detect a chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases
   associated with the 10-foot rule.
       10.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4
       whenever they stay within 10 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few
       seconds. This MOPP level provides personnel the maximum protection from the
       chemical agent as it transitions from a contact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
       10.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves of a sort
       (i.e. leather, rubber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated
       equipment. Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent
       may still be present. The use of gloves will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact
       with agent residue is avoided.
       10.5.10.3. Table 10-2 shows times associated with initial and follow-on phases of the 10-
       foot rule. To simplify response processes, commanders may choose to use the worst case
       scenario as the foundation for all 10-foot rule actions, i.e., 24 hours for the initial phase
       and all periods of time greater than 24 hours for the follow-on phase.

                                           Chapter 11

                               NAVIGATION PROCEDURES

11.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures and requirements for worldwide enroute C-
17 navigation. It is to be used in conjunction with procedures and requirements set forth in AFI
11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217, and FLIP. Since airspace and associated navigational aid
equipment capability are rapidly evolving, pilots must maintain an in depth knowledge of current
requirements/policies.
   11.1.1. Prolonged Loss of Contact. Aircrews must ensure they are following proper
   navigation crosscheck procedures to maintain airspace situational awareness.
       11.1.1.1. Aircrews will use navigation charts to identify radio frequency changeover
       points to minimize the likelihood of prolonged loss of communication with ATC/radio
       operators. Additionally, both pilots must monitor both VHF and UHF Guard to the
       maximum extent possible.
       11.1.1.2. At the first indication of a suspected or known loss of two-way radio capability,
       aircrews shall change their transponder mode 3/A to 7600. Squawking 7600 highlights
       the loss of two-way radio capability to ATC/radio operators and minimizes the risk of
       being intercepted.
       11.1.1.3. In cases of suspected loss of contact with ATC, attempt to reestablish contact
       using other aircraft to relay messages to ATC controllers.
   11.1.2. Post Flight.
       11.1.2.1. For legs in which suspected or reported navigational error, procedural
       deviation, or other abnormality have occurred, download and retain a copy of the M-
       PLAN and mission HISTORY diskette and all pertinent forms including, but not limited
       to DD Form 175, DD Form 175-1, DD Form 1801, ACFP, PFPS materials, charts, and
       navigation log. Units will maintain all operational mission data on file (hard disk, diskette
       file, paper copy, oceanic plotting chart, etc.) for 120 days.
       11.1.2.2. For suspected/reported airdrop malfunctions or off-DZ drops, record ADXX
       RECALL page information before leaving the aircraft.
       11.1.2.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) Computer discs will be clearly labeled with the
       appropriate mission numbers and dates. The mission computer IDENT for each mission
       history file will use the following naming convention: first and last name, initials of the
       PIC, followed by the three-digit Julian day. In the event of multiple mission history
       download requirements during the same Julian day, append the first IDENT with the
       suffix ―A,‖ the second with ―B,‖ the third with ―C,‖ and so on (e.g., JR123A, JR123B).
   11.1.3. GPS and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are synonymous terms when
   referencing GPS equipment and /or procedures.
   11.1.4. Sources for obtaining IRU PPOS coordinates will be in the following priority:
       11.1.4.1. GPS PPOS IAW flight manual.
 166                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


       11.1.4.2. FLIP/Jeppesen Airfield diagrams or MAJCOM approved parking spot
       handouts.
       11.1.4.3. DoD FLIP En Route Supplement.
       11.1.4.4. Best available chart.
11.2. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. (See FLIP, FCG, and AP, for further
guidance). US Military aircraft and DoD personnel entering another nation to conduct US
government business must have the approval of the foreign government concerned to enter their
airspace. Foreign clearances for US international air operations are obtained through US
officials known as Defense Attache Officers (DAOs).
   11.2.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and territorial
   airspace. International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states' territorial seas.
   Military aircraft operate in such areas free of interference or control by the coastal state.
   Territorial airspace includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters, inland
   waters, and land territory, and is sovereign airspace. Over flight may be conducted in such
   areas only with the consent of the sovereign country.
   11.2.2. Consistent with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12NMs.
   Diplomatic constraints and/or a lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions
   operating in international airspace. Therefore, it is imperative sufficient information be
   provided far enough in advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements established by
   the countries concerned. The US does not normally recognize territorial claims beyond
   12NMs; however, specific guidance from certain US authorities may establish limits, which
   differ from the standard.
   11.2.3. Flight Information Region (FIR). A FIR is an area of airspace within which flight
   information and related services are provided. An FIR does not reflect international borders
   or sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an established FIR without approval of
   the adjacent country, provided the PIC avoids flight in territorial airspace.
   11.2.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace into
   territorial airspace, for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not amend
   entry/exit point(s).
   11.2.5. Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or
   departure of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace for which a clearance
   has not been duly requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
   11.2.6. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for
   penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective
   country. Aircraft clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
   11.2.7. In the event ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or attempts to
   negate existing clearances, PICs must evaluate the circumstances. The normal response will
   be to attempt to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft will continue to planned destination,
   as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase is "in international airspace." Safety of
   flight is paramount in determining mission continuation. Under no circumstances should
   aircrews construe a clearance, which routes their mission over sovereign airspace, which was
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                     167


   not approved through diplomatic channels before mission departure, as being valid
   authorization.
   11.2.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing will
   normally be briefed at home station, onload station, and/or by the last C2 facility transited
   before performing the critical portion of the mission.
   11.2.9. Aircrews (except on weather reconnaissance missions) normally are not tasked to
   and will not fly "due regard" routings unless coordinated with the appropriate MAJCOM C2
   and specifically directed in the mission FRAG. The "due regard" or "operational" option
   obligates the military PIC to be their own ATC agency to separate their aircraft from all other
   air traffic. If operational requirements dictate, PICs may exercise the "due regard" option to
   protect their aircraft. Aircraft will return to normal air traffic services as soon as practical.
   Refer to FLIP GP for additional guidance on due regard.
11.3. Navigation Databases/Flight Plans/Data Verification.
   11.3.1. While the DOD migrates toward the use of digital products, aircrews must remain
   aware that there may be cases where coding errors could result in discrepancies between the
   database and the published procedure. For this reason, always crosscheck WWNDB
   procedures (DAFIF) against traditional paper FLIP prior to flying any procedure IAW
   AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1. If a discrepancy is identified, submit the details to their unit
   OGV or Stan/Eval office. Unclassified confirmed discrepancies will be emailed to National
   Geospatial-Intelligence Agency‘s (NGA) aero quality feedback section at
   QUALITY@NGA.MIL and AMC/A3VX.
   11.3.2. Advanced Computer Flight Plan (ACFP) Use. ACFPs are the official sources of
   performance, navigation, and climatic data, including en route wind information. If stand-
   alone computer based plans are used, each mission segment should utilize best wind data
   available. Use only MAJCOM validated ACFPs.
      11.3.2.1. Use ACFPs to the maximum extent practical. A printed PFPS computer flight
      plan is an approved substitute if it includes all ACFP navigational/waypoint data and
      enroute wind and temperature deviation data. The PFPS computer flight plan must also
      include the planned payload and ramp fuel. The PIC has final responsibility for flight
      plan accuracy and diplomatic clearance compliance.
      11.3.2.2. Verify ACFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before
      departure. Pass any flight plan discrepancies to the TACC flight planning office. On
      flight-managed sorties, promptly notify the flight manager of any flight plan
      discrepancies. Identify inaccurate ACFP winds to the flight manager in-flight or TACC
      flight planners post flight when the wind at the ACFP flight level exceeds either 30° error
      in direction or 25 knots in speed.
      11.3.2.3. Flight plan course values may differ between the ACFP and the mission
      computer flight plan. The ACFP course value (mag or true) is the average course
      direction for that leg. The mission computer flight plan course is the initial course
      outbound measured from the leg‘s beginning waypoint after any rollouts. Therefore, the
      mission computer‘s flight plan course may differ by a few degrees from the ACFP‘s
      flight plan course. The magnitude of this difference is more pronounced depending on
      leg length and direction.

   11.3.3. Aeronautical Information Regulation and Control (AIRAC) cycle
       11.3.3.1. Effectivity of the aircraft‘s WWNDB and aircrew Aeronautical Information
       Publication (AIP)/FLIP documents are based on AIRAC cycles.
       11.3.3.2. ICAO Document 8126 (Aeronautical Information Services Manual) specifies
       that 00:01 UTC shall be used to indicate the time when new AIP/FLIP documents will
       become effective. However, some countries have filed an exception. For example, the
       United States is 09:01 UTC on the effective date while Australia is 16:00 UTC the day
       prior to the effective date. AIRAC cycle changes require ATC computer systems to be
       updated. For that reason, some countries have modified their AIRAC cycle change
       day/time when air traffic is at the normal daily minimum for their airspace.
       11.3.3.3. Pilot considerations during non 0001 UTC AIRAC cycle changes. Even
       though numerous NGA FLIP products have 0001 UTC effective times printed on them,
       plan not to receive a clearance for new or changed published procedures/ routings until
       that ATC system‘s airspace computers have been updated.
11.4. Master Flight Plan / Plotting Chart.
   11.4.1. Crews will use the MAJCOM approved plotting chart to plot all oceanic waypoints
   from entry to exit. DOD enroute charts that cover the oceanic routing are the only suitable
   substitute to the approved plotting chart and must be turned into unit OGV upon mission
   completion. NOTE: The AMC approved plotting chart is located on the AMC/A3V website
   under publications.
   11.4.2. Prior to flight, the PIC or designated representative shall plot the oceanic portion of
   the flight on an appropriate plotting chart. Place the following information on the chart:
       11.4.2.1. Mission number.
       11.4.2.2. Preparer‘s and PIC‘s name.
       11.4.2.3. Date.
       11.4.2.4. Flight plan route depicting reporting points with proper names or coordinates.
       11.4.2.5. Equal Time Point for emergency recovery to alternate airfield.
       11.4.2.6. On AR missions, plot the ARIP, ARCP, exit, and turn points.
   11.4.3. Multiple legs on the same chart are permissible when practical.
   11.4.4. Following mission completion, turn in applicable items: plotting charts, ACFP
   (master document copy), and the filed flight plan (DD 1801). Units will maintain these items
   as part of flight records for a minimum of 120 days.
11.5. Navigation Capability / Airspace Requirements.
   11.5.1. RNAV/RNP.
       11.5.1.1. C-17A aircraft are approved for unrestricted MNPS (RNAV 12.6), RNP-10,
       BRNAV (RNP-5), RNAV 2, RNAV 1, and PRNAV operations.
          11.5.1.1.1. C-17A aircraft with Block 17 software are approved for enroute and
          terminal RNP operations down to and including RNP 0.3.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                              169


  11.5.2. MNPS, RNP-x, P-RNAV, BRNAV, RNAV-2, and RNAV-1 are defined in FLIP and
  are considered special qualification airspace. Additional restrictions to include CPDLC/ADS
  equipment may be required in special qualification airspace.
     11.5.2.1. Should any required equipment fail before entering such airspace, comply with
     FLIP restrictions or request a new clearance to avoid this airspace.
     11.5.2.2. Should any required equipment fail after entry into such airspace, immediately
     notify ATC and coordinate a plan of action.
     11.5.2.3. Document (AFTO 781) malfunctions or failures of required equipment,
     including the failure of this equipment to meet tolerances.
  11.5.3. RNAV airspace/procedure restrictions.
     11.5.3.1. Manual entry of waypoints using Latitude/Longitude or Place/Bearing is
     prohibited on any RNAV procedure. RNAV point-to-point navigation, e.g. Navigation
     Reference System (NRS) waypoints, NAT tracks, remote oceanic navigation, etc. are the
     only times when Lat/Long entry is allowed for RNAV.
     11.5.3.2. Pilots will not change any RNAV database waypoint turn property from ―no‖ to
     ―yes‖ or vice versa.
     11.5.3.3. Waypoints may be deleted in order to comply with NOTAMs or ATC
     clearances,, e.g. deleting the course reversal on an approach when cleared via a NO PT
     routing.
     11.5.3.4. Altitude and airspeed parameters may be adjusted to match current NOTAMs,
     ATC clearance, or cold weather adjustments.
     11.5.3.5. Do not use PPS-loaded GPS/MGPS as the update source for IFR navigation in
     civil airspace. The FAA has not certified PPS-coded GPS for civil navigation due to the
     classified nature of the PPS codes. EXCEPTION: PPS-loaded GPS may be utilized for
     navigation when specifically authorized in FLIP (AP series), specified in an OPORD, or
     by MAJCOM/A3 (or equivalent).
     11.5.3.6. RNAV procedures or routes requiring WAAS or LAAS equipment are not
     authorized; the C-17‘s GPS equipment does not have WAAS or LAAS capabilities.
  11.5.4. RNAV SID/STAR restrictions.
     11.5.4.1. The RNAV procedure will not be flown if course and distance discrepancies
     exist between the WWNDB procedure and charted procedure, and the differences are
     greater than allowed in AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1.
     11.5.4.2. There are cases where non-RNAV procedures have the same routing,
     NAVAIDs, and/or waypoints published as an RNAV procedure (RNAV in the
     title). AFMAN 11-217v1 may be misleading to crew actions in stating that underlying
     NAVAIDs must be monitored if available for stand-alone RNAV SID/STAR. First, do
     not assume the courses on the RNAV procedure are the NAVAID radials. Second, when
     flying an RNAV procedure, do not use radials and/or courses from a conventional non-
     RNAV procedure with the same routing to the RNAV procedure. There are several
     technical reasons differences may exist. RNAV procedures do not put NAVAID
     frequencies and Morse code on the procedure for these reasons. Bottom line: when
170                              AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


      flying an RNAV procedure and RNAV capability is lost, notify ATC that RNAV
      capability is lost and request an alternate clearance.
      11.5.4.3. NGA (DOD) published RNAV terminal procedures SID/STARs, and
      approaches are the only type authorized. Using other published RNAV terminal
      procedures are prohibited, e.g. Jeppesen, host nation flip, etc.
      11.5.4.4. At least one GPS must be operational and updating the MC present position
      (MC PPOS) before departing on an RNAV departure. Radio updating is not authorized
      as an update source on the ground prior to departing on an RNAV departure.
      EXCEPTION: If GPS updating fails during takeoff, the takeoff and planned RNAV
      departure may be continued. RNAV guidance will remain valid for up to fifteen minutes
      following failure. When able, follow flight manual section three procedures after safely
      airborne regarding failure of RNAV components. NOTE: Complete GPS failure will be
      indicated by a NAV MCD/GPS MCD cue with accompanying MCD message GPS INOP
      (Block 16) or both MGPS INOP and CGPS INOP (Block 17).
  11.5.5. RNAV/GPS Approach Restrictions (Block 17 aircraft only).
      11.5.5.1. Aircrews may fly any procedure with ―RNAV (GPS) RWY‖ in the approach
      title or those that have ONLY ―GPS RWY‖ in the approach title. These are stand-alone
      GPS-based approaches. These approaches can be identified on approach plates by the
      presence of GPS waypoint depictions (black diamond waypoints). EXAMPLES:
      ―RNAV (GPS) RWY 19‖ at Andrews AFB, ―ILS Z or RNAV (GPS) RWY 23‖ at Cherry
      Point MCAS, and ―GPS RWY 22‖ at Mankato regional.
      11.5.5.2. C-17 aircrews are not authorized to maintain overlay ground tracks based
      solely on GPS. GPS overlay approach construction is subject to coding errors and may
      not provide course guidance over the proper ground track. These approaches can be
      identified on approach plates by the absence of GPS waypoint depictions (black diamond
      waypoints). EXAMPLES: ―NDB or GPS-A‖ at Blackstone AAF or ―VOR or GPS
      RWY 31‖ at Butts AAF can only be flown while referencing ground based NAVAIDs
      and not as a stand-alone GPS approach.
      11.5.5.3. Instrument approach procedures titled ―RNAV (RNP)‖ or ―RNAV (RNP AR)‖
      or RNAV procedures that have ―Special Aircraft & Aircrew Authorization Required
      (SAAAR)‖ statements in the profile view are not authorized.
      11.5.5.4. GPS approaches are flown to non-precision MDA (LNAV MDA or S-xx) or
      circling minima only.
      11.5.5.5. GPS approaches in civilian airspace require the use of CGPS equipment.
      MAJCOM/A3 or equivalent may approve RNAV operations and approaches utilizing
      MGPS only.
      11.5.5.6. Charting discrepancies. Aircrews must confirm all IAP components match the
      charted IAP (e.g. waypoint type, course, distance, altitude constraints, etc.). If
      differences greater than specified in AFMAN 11-217v1 exist between the WWNDB
      procedure and charted procedure, the procedure will not be flown. EXCEPTION:
      aircrew may fly GPS approaches if the only difference between the charted instrument
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  171


       approach procedure (IAP) and the DAFIF database procedure is the name of the missed
       approach point.
       11.5.5.7. Accepting ATC vectors. Aircrews may accept ATC vectors to a published
       point on the approach or ATC vectors to intercept the final course. Direct-to function: if
       established on vectors to intercept an RNAV course, crews may utilize the 1R LSK
       direct-to/intercept to waypoint function. Use the inbound course value for the intercept
       from the MC FPLAN page. Once crews confirm that the ND map displays their
       intended action, crews will arm LNAV and ensure it is engaged. Crews will not descend
       to the next applicable altitude until established on a published segment of the approach.
       11.5.5.8. VNAV is not authorized between the FAF and missed approach
       waypoint. MSN VNAV (MSN descent) may be used between the Initial Approach Fix
       (IAF) and Final Approach Fix (FAF). However, crewmembers are reminded that the
       MSN VNAV algorithm remains a ―dive and drive system‖ and may command descents
       greater than authorized during intermediate approach segments (TERPS criteria is based
       on a maximum descent of 500 ft/nm, approximately 1500 VVI, between the IAF and
       FAF). Furthermore, MSN speeds may revert to tech order after vertical profile
       calculations. As a result, speed select mode (speed on thrust/pitch) and/or vertical speed
       mode (vertical speed command wheel) used in conjunction with MSN LNAV is the
       recommended mode for most RNAV approaches.
11.6. Enroute / Flight Progress.
   11.6.1. Use all available FLIP en route charts, and prior to departures and arrivals, terrain
   charts, to ensure navigational accuracy and terrain clearance. For non-RNP software aircraft,
   periodically crosscheck the navigation solution (MC FOM).
   11.6.2. For waypoints entered using Lat/Long, both pilots will use the ND CHART format in
   conjunction with the DEFINE/REVIEW WAYPOINT pages to insure the proper coordinates
   were loaded for all points in the flight plan.
   11.6.3. If a revised clearance is received, revise the flight plan in the mission computer and
   both pilots review the revised route before executing the change.
   11.6.4. Flying In Polar Regions.
       11.6.4.1. Because the C-17 does not rely on magnetic field sensors for heading
       determination, navigation in Polar Regions poses no significant difficulties. Magnetic and
       grid headings are provided for pilot selection by converting true heading information
       from IRU sources.
       11.6.4.2. Magnetic variation information is stored as a look-up table in the IRU and
       provides variation data from 72°N to 60°S. No variation data is supplied above/below
       these latitudes. Refer to the 1-C-17A-1-2 for Polar Operations. Manual magnetic
       variation should only be selected when magnetic headings must be flown.
       11.6.4.3. Manual magnetic variation is not taken into consideration when displaying
       runways from the PERMANENT NAV DATABASE, as display logic assumes a zero
       magnetic variation. To get correct runway displays on the NAV display, a new runway
       must be created in the CUSTOM NAV DATABASE oriented to true or grid as
       applicable.
172                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


      11.6.4.4. Whenever a magnetic heading is displayed pilots will see a jump in the heading
      scale as the magnetic variation is significantly changed. This occurs normally at
      72°N/60°S or when manual magnetic variations are inserted into the MC. If the AP/FD is
      engaged in HDG or HDG HOLD modes while following this magnetic heading, the
      aircraft will execute a turn in order to maintain the magnetic heading selected prior to the
      jump. These turns do not occur if the heading reference for the pilot ID switch was in
      TRUE or GRID when the heading was selected on the AP/FD. No turns will occur if the
      AP/FD is engaged in the MSN lateral mode when crossing 72°N/60°S.
      11.6.4.5. Grid heading reference is provided to pilots with a mathematical relationship
      defined in USAF air navigation manuals using a grid chart conversion factor of 1.0.
      While grid heading is selectable for display anytime via the MFC panel, it is only
      accurate at high latitudes where the grid convergence factor is actually 1.0. Pilots should
      consider this heading accurate at the latitudes near and above 72°N/60°S. The message
      GRID MODE is displayed on the WAP when passing these latitudes for higher ones to
      indicate to the pilot that valid grid headings are available for navigation. If pilots have
      entered a manual magnetic variation as described above, the GRID MODE message is
      removed. Accurate grid headings are still available, but the MC interprets the pilot
      entered manual magnetic variation as a desire to fly magnetic headings, not grid
      headings.
      11.6.4.6. The BDHI is oriented to magnetic headings and is not affected by HDG REF
      SEL knob (Block 16), however, for Block 17, Grid reference is provided when GRID is
      selected on HDG REF SEL. As mentioned above, for latitudes above 72°N/60°S, the
      programmed magnetic variation is zero and the magnetic heading is incorrect; the BDHI
      essentially displays true headings. The VOR/TACAN/ADF needles still operate; the ADF
      continues to give relative bearing, and the VOR/TACAN needles are slaved to the correct
      radials. However, to determine correct magnetic headings for VOR/TACAN intercepts, a
      manual magnetic variation must be input if the stations are oriented to magnetic north.
      This is also true if trying to determine magnetic bearing from an NDB. If the
      VOR/TACAN/NDB is oriented to true north, then the magnetic variation must be zero
      for correct display on the BDHI.
      11.6.4.7. For VOR and TACAN navigational aids, the course select knob on the CNC is
      consistent with the orientation of the NAVAID as defined in the NAV DATABASE. If
      the NAVAID is oriented to true, then a 300 course set in the CNC is a 300 true course; if
      the NAVAID is oriented to grid, then the course is a 300 grid course. Currently all
      NAVAIDs in the PERMANENT NAV DATABASE are defined as magnetic; pilots must
      use the custom database to define a true or grid oriented NAVAID. Navigation position
      information is most easily interpreted when the displayed heading is consistent with the
      orientation of the NAVAID used (i.e., fly true headings when flying true TACAN radials,
      grid headings for grid courses, etc.).
      11.6.4.8. For ILS approaches, the MC always assumes the course in the CNC to be
      magnetic. This has no effect on the ability of the aircraft to correctly fly the ILS, but is
      necessary for the MC to determine the ILS intercept angle and display NAV data. Pilots
      desiring to fly a magnetic ILS approach above 72°N/60°S should dial the magnetic
      course in the CNC and insert a manual magnetic variation in the MC. To fly a true ILS,
      pilots should dial the true course and ensure the MAG VAR is zero. Attempts to fly a
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  173


       magnetic ILS with incorrect magnetic variation should not cause problems once
       established on final; the intercept may be erratic and the NAV display will show a
       heading different from the ILS course equal to the error in magnetic variation as the
       aircraft tracks the ILS beam (no wind situation). Grid only ILS procedures are not
       supported; pilots must convert the grid ILS approach course in the instrument approach
       procedure to a magnetic or true course, then ensure the correct MANUAL MAG VAR is
       inserted in the MC (local terminal magnetic variation for MAG ILS, zero magnetic
       variation for true ILS).
11.7. Low-Level Navigation. Threat and emission control requirements permitting, use all
available aids (.i.e. mission computer data, navigational aid fixes, map reading) to remain
position oriented
   11.7.1. While aircraft systems provide a self-contained adverse weather, day/night,
   worldwide navigation capability, pilots assume ultimate responsibility for en route
   navigation, terrain avoidance, and time control. During low level operations, attention shall
   be focused outside the aircraft, emphasizing threat detection and situational awareness. Limit
   duties that distract attention from outside the aircraft to mission essential items only.
   11.7.2. A navigation display (ND) map format shall be displayed on at least one MFD at all
   times.
   11.7.3. Time of Arrival (TOA) control is primarily accomplished by airspeed adjustments.
   11.7.4. Means of Navigation.
       11.7.4.1. One radar altimeter will be operational for all low levels. The mission
       computer navigation solution is the primary means of navigation backed-up with map
       reading, on VFR low level routes. If conditions permit, ground-based navigational aids
       can be used as additional information sources.
       11.7.4.2. The mission computer is the primary means of route navigation in IMC.
       Onboard radar, ground-based radar, and/or bearing/distance fixes should be used as
       backups.
   11.7.5. Low level modified contour flight may result in small deviations above and below
   the base altitude for smoothness of flight.
   11.7.6. Altimeter Settings. In the absence of reported or forecasted barometric setting, crews
   may use the MC GPS barometric setting with the following restrictions:
       11.7.6.1. Day VMC. Crews will use visual references to ensure terrain and obstacle
       clearance
          11.7.6.1.1. Barometric altitudes (MSA, ESA, etc) will be increased by 1000 feet.
       11.7.6.2. Night or IMC. Crews will add 1000 feet to their planned minimum altitudes.
11.8. Mission Computer Approaches.
   11.8.1. The C-17 mission computer approach uses the MC APPROACH page of the mission
   computer. It only mathematically derives a final approach course and glide path from default
   or pilot input data. NOTE: Reference AFTTP 3-3.C-17 for techniques on programming
   Mission Computer approaches.
174                              AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


  11.8.2. In a contingency, the crew will be provided an approved (TERPS‘ed) approach
  procedure leading to a mission computer approach final approach fix. All course data and
  altitude restrictions required to program the approach in the mission computer will be
  included on the approach procedure. This will include any high-precision waypoints,
  weather minimums, and missed approach instructions required to safely execute the
  approach.
  11.8.3. Restrictions on Mission Computer Approaches.
      11.8.3.1. Mission computer approach procedures in IMC will only be used when no
      other published approach procedure is available and with specific authorization from
      MAJCOM/A3/DO. All crews are authorized to use these procedures for training in VFR
      conditions IAW AFI 11-202V3.
      11.8.3.2. Mission computer navigation accuracy.
         11.8.3.2.1. RNP aircraft require an RNP value of 0.3 nm from the FAF to the
         Runway (unless non-std TERPs values used).
         11.8.3.2.2. Non-RNP aircraft require a FOM of 3 or less. The PM will confirm the
         MC FOM is 3 or less after departing the FAF.
      11.8.3.3. It is highly recommended that the approach be flown with the autopilot
      coupled.
      11.8.3.4. Weather minima for approved MC approaches will be no lower than 600-2.
      11.8.3.5. Lateral Deviation.
         11.8.3.5.1. Non RNP aircraft. The PM will monitor the approach on the ND map
         display with MAP/RDR RNG set to 5 NM. Prior to the FAF, if the aircraft symbol
         deviates from the magenta line by more than 1/2 nm, as displayed on the MFD map
         display, the PF will execute the missed approach, unless the runway is in sight. After
         the FAF, ensure LDI does not exceed ½ full scale deflection.
         11.8.3.5.2. For RNP aircraft, ensure LDI does not exceed ½ full scale deflection.
      11.8.3.6. Navigation System Malfunctions.
         11.8.3.6.1. Non-RNP aircraft. Unless the runway is in sight execute the missed
         approach procedure if ―DEGRADED NAV ACC‖, ―INSUFF NAV ACC‖, or
         ―FLUSH ALL‖ is displayed on the WAP during the approach.
         11.8.3.6.2. RNP aircraft. Unless the runway is in sight, execute the missed approach
         procedure if ―UNABLE RNP‖ or ―OVRFLY NOT POSSIBLE‖ appears on the MCD.
      11.8.3.7. All of the waypoints required to fly the approach and missed approach must
      exist in the current navigation database. If the waypoints are not in the permanent
      navigation database, aircrews will be provided the required waypoints to be loaded
      electronically into the custom navigation database. Aircrew will not manually enter or
      alter the latitude or longitude coordinates for any portion of the approach, or missed
      approach.
      11.8.3.8. Enter all of the waypoints for the approach up to the FAF in the primary flight
      plan.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                175


     11.8.3.9. Enter all of the waypoints for the missed approach, starting with the missed
     approach waypoint (MAWP), in the secondary flight plan. Special attention should be
     paid to whether each waypoint is an ―over fly‖ or ―under fly‖. The MAWP is usually an
     ―over fly‖ waypoint.
        11.8.3.9.1. Secondary FPLAN will be displayed on at least one ND Map display.
     11.8.3.10. Both pilots will review the entire procedure in the mission computer, verifying
     both the coordinates and the MFD map display for accuracy, prior to commencing the
     approach. If any portion does not agree with the approved procedure, the approach will
     not be flown.
  11.8.4. Mission Computer Approach Planning Guidance. Planners will reference AFJMAN
  11-226, United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) and/or AFI
  11-2C-17, Volume 3, addenda B.C-17 Special Operations (FOUO).

                                          Chapter 12

                 AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT PROCEDURES

12.1. General. This chapter contains aircrew procedures not contained in the flight manual,
other portions of this AFI, or other publications.
12.2. Responsibilities. Aircrew may assist the normal maintenance function when critical
contingency tasking dictate their use, provided this action does not impact crew duty and crew
rest limits specified in Chapter 3 of this AFI.
12.3. Authority to Clear a Red X. Pilots are not authorized to clear a Red X. If a situation is
encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are not
available to clear it, the PIC may obtain authorization to clear the Red X from the home station
MXG/CC or designated representative, in accordance with T.O. 00-20-1. Other crew members
are not authorized to clear a Red X. EXCEPTION: The PIC may clear Red Xs for engine
covers, pitot covers, gear pins and SPR drains when qualified maintenance personnel are not
available, unless prohibited by the home station MXG/CC or OG/CC.
12.4. Refueling/Defueling.
   12.4.1. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew members qualified in ground refueling may perform
   refueling duties. Crewmembers will normally make a AFTO Form 781 red diagonal entry
   rather than draining the SPR sumps. Aircrews will only refuel in cases when maintenance
   support is not readily available and the mission would be delayed. Crewmembers may
   augment maintenance refueling teams at en route stops.
   12.4.2. Refer to TO 1C-17A-1 and TO 1C-17A-2-12JG-28-1. For normal refueling, two
   qualified personnel are required. If aircrew refueling is required at a base with AMC support,
   the PIC will submit an AMC Form 54, describing the circumstances.
       12.4.2.1. Hot Refueling. Hot refueling (refueling with aircraft engines running) will
       only be conducted by crews that have been authorized and certified IAW AFI 11-235,
       Forward Area Refueling/Rearming Point (FARRP) Operations and AFI 11-2C-17,
       Volume 3, Addenda B.
   12.4.3. Concurrent Servicing operations are not required on MAF aircraft unless
   refueling/defueling with JP-4, loading/downloading flares, or servicing LOX. Simultaneous
   servicing of fuel while loading passengers, cargo (including hazardous or explosive),
   performing maintenance, aircrew members performing inspections, or operating aircraft
   systems is considered to be a normal fuel servicing operation.
       12.4.3.1. If required refer to TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static
       Grounding/Bonding.
12.5. Maintenance Monitor Panel.
   12.5.1. Aircrews will not erase any fault unless specifically directed by maintenance.
   12.5.2. COMP FANS will be selected to operate the OBIGGS compressor fans when any
   crewmember needs to go beneath the cargo floor. The upper ON legend is illuminated when
   the switch is depressed, the lower FANS legend will illuminate when both fans are open.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                     177


   When selected closed, the OPEN light will extinguish when both fans are off, then the ON
   light will go out.
12.6. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base (MOB). When an aircraft will
land at a base other than the MOB, a crew chief should accompany the aircraft. The PIC is
responsible for ensuring the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent mission taskings. If qualified
maintenance specialists are unavailable, the aircrew is responsible for turning the aircraft to meet
subsequent mission taskings.
   12.6.1. Recovery items the aircrew may be responsible for include, but are not limited to, the
   following:
       12.6.1.1. Parking and receiving.
       12.6.1.2. Aircraft servicing.
       12.6.1.3. Supervision of minor maintenance within local capability.
       12.6.1.4. Minor configuration changes to meet mission tasking.
       12.6.1.5. Securing the aircraft before entering crew rest.
       12.6.1.6. Coordinating aircraft security requirements.
       12.6.1.7. AFTO 781-series forms maintenance.
   12.6.2. In all cases where aircrews must service the without qualified maintenance specialist
   assistance, comply with procedures in this chapter.
   12.6.3. Aircrews are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections. In those
   instances where maintenance personnel are not available, the aircrew will enter a red dash
   symbol in the AFTO Form 781A, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
   Document, updating current status and enter a red dash symbol and a discrepancy that
   reflects that the applicable maintenance inspection (i.e. pre-flight, thru-flight, basic post-
   flight) is overdue. Reference TO 00-20-1/AMC1.
12.7. Aircraft Servicing Requirements. When adequate maintenance support is not available,
the aircrew may need to perform certain maintenance tasks. Use the job guides (JG) in Table
12.1 If aircrew servicing is required at a base with AMC support, the PIC will submit an AMC
Form 54 describing the circumstances.           NOTE: Aircrews should consult a qualified

                                           Chapter 13

                        CARGO AND PASSENGER PROCEDURES

13.1. General. The loadmaster coordinates loading or offloading with air terminal operations or
the shipping agency; plans loads; provides in-flight services to passengers, and supervises
onloading or off-loading operations. If airdrop qualified, the loadmaster participates in the aerial
delivery of equipment, supplies and personnel.
13.2. Responsibilities for Aircraft Loading.
   13.2.1. AMC Designated Stations:
       13.2.1.1. Aerial port personnel are responsible for selecting cargo and mail for airlift,
       promptly completing documentation, palletizing cargo, load planning (as required),
       computing load distribution, and moving cargo to and from the aircraft to meet scheduled
       departure. Before starting loading operations, they will brief the loadmaster of
       destination, size, weight, and types of cargo (classified, hazardous, etc.) to permit proper
       positioning. They will also coordinate traffic activities affecting loading and offloading,
       and assign sufficient aerial port loading personnel for cargo loading. Aerial port
       personnel are responsible for safe positioning of material handling equipment (MHE) and
       cargo to or from the aircraft cargo door, ramp or ramp toes. Under the supervision of the
       loadmaster, aerial port personnel will prepare the aircraft for loading, stow loading
       equipment if the aircraft is not to be reloaded, physically load the aircraft, tie down cargo
       and equipment, release tie down and physically offload cargo.
       13.2.1.2. The loadmaster is responsible for aircraft preflight, load planning (as required),
       certifying load plans, preparing weight and balance documentation, operating aircraft
       equipment, and cargo tie down. The loadmaster coordinates with the loading crew
       supervisor to validate the cargo against manifests, supervises and directs on/offloading
       and is responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of the aircraft. The
       loadmaster will notify the PIC, C2, or terminal operations officer if loading personnel are
       injured or if cargo, aircraft equipment, or aircraft structure is damaged during
       on/offloading. The loadmaster will brief the PIC on any hazardous cargo and cargo
       jettisonability prior to engine start.
       13.2.1.3. Loads planned by qualified load planners will be accepted by the aircraft
       loadmaster and loaded aboard the aircraft as planned, unless the load or any portion of it
       will compromise flight safety or does not comply with applicable aircraft technical orders
       or USAF/MAJCOM publications. If cargo is refused or rearranged for these reasons,
       forward all applicable information, including a copy of the load plan, to MAJCOM
       Stan/Eval through Stan/Eval channels. AMC personnel attach an AMC Form 54, Aircraft
       Commander’s Report on Services/Facilities. EXCEPTION: The aircraft loadmaster
       may deviate from load plans to facilitate ease of on/offloading of cargo, accommodate
       additional passengers, to alleviate unnecessary aircraft reconfiguration and if practical to
       load to optimum aircraft performance CG without submitting documentation. The aircraft
       loadmaster must take into consideration the next station‘s cargo configuration
       requirements and will ensure the aircraft is in proper weight and balance limits. A new
       load plan is not required.
 180                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


       13.2.1.4. The loadmaster is the on-scene expert for load planning and accepting cargo for
       airlift. Some loads are not specifically detailed in applicable directives and require the
       loadmaster to use his/her best judgment based on training, experience, and knowledge to
       determine the best and safest method of loading the cargo. When difficulties arise, they
       should seek the advice of other personnel (i.e., squadron, group, wing or MAJCOM
       Stan/Eval personnel).
          13.2.1.4.1. Cargo/equipment not contained in TO 1C-17A-9 Section VI that exceeds
          TO 1C-17A-9 Section IV limitations, requires excessive shoring, or unique restraint
          provisions requires certification for air shipment. The shipper will provide a copy of
          the certification to the loadmaster prior to loading. If the certification letter with
          loading instructions/requirements is not provided to the loadmaster the cargo will not
          be loaded. Contact Air Transportability Test Loading Agency (ATTLA) or
          ASC/ENFC at Wright Patterson AFB, OH, voicemail (937) 255-2330/2547 or
          MAJCOM Stan/Eval for questions concerning cargo certification.
              13.2.1.4.1.1. Items contained in TO 1C-17A-9 Section VI have specific loading
              procedures that must be adhered to. A certification letter is not required unless it
              is discovered that an item cannot be loaded as defined. Forward a copy of the
              load plan to HQ AMC/A3VX along with detailed reasoning for rejection.
          13.2.1.4.2. IAW with ATTLA memo, dated 7 May 2002, certification memos prior to
          1993 are validated to include blanket airlift approval for C-17 airlift. This approval
          applies to cargo previously certified on C-130/C-141 aircraft and for those
          applications previously certified on C-5 aircraft that do not violate the limitations in
          TO 1C-17-9 loading manual. The aircraft loadmaster is the final authority in
          determining the validity of certifications on C-17 aircraft. If the loadmaster
          determines the cargo is incompatible with aircraft dimensions/limitations or
          additional steps/special procedures are required to enable a safe on load, a Cargo
          On/Off Loading Validation Worksheet following the procedures in para 13.9 will be
          required. State the reason for rejection or comments and recommendations that aided
          in a safe on/offload. Forward worksheet to HQ AMC/A3VX.
   13.2.2. At locations without AMC air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes
   responsibilities in paragraph 13.2.1.1. and provides sufficient qualified personnel and MHE
   for on/offloading. Loadmaster responsibilities and authority are the same as described in
   paragraphs 13.2.1.2 and 13.2.1.3
   13.2.3. During joint airborne air transportability training (JA/ATT), special assignment
   airlift missions (SAAM), USAF mobility, and contingency missions, the loadmaster can
   accept DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record, as valid pre-inspection of equipment
   being offered for air shipment. This form, validated by two joint inspector signatures (user
   and transporting force), may be used in lieu of applicable portions of the vehicle inspection
   portion of the applicable loading checklist. However, this does not relieve the loadmaster
   from ensuring accompanying loads are secured prior to takeoff. The DD Form 2133 will not
   be used to document preparation of hazardous materials. This will be accomplished using
   the Shipper‘s Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
13.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. A clear unobstructed path must be maintained in
case of an emergency evacuation of personnel. OBLE, crew or passenger bags will not be
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                    181


secured in a manner that will impede the use of emergency exits. No part of the cargo load will
extend over the edge of the walkway. EXCEPTION: Equipment such as spare tires, mirrors,
etc., protruding from rolling stock may extend over the walkway. Palletized cargo may extend
beyond the vertical stacking line of the pallet only if specifically authorized in the loading
manual or a load certification letter.
   13.3.1. All passenger hand-carried items must be of a size to fit under the seat and must not
   obstruct the safety aisle. Any item that does not fit under a seat or obstruct an aisle way will
   be stowed with checked baggage and secured for flight.
   13.3.2. When the load consists of palletized netted cargo or is secured with straps, a 30-inch
   space will be maintained between the cargo and the nearest forward litter, occupied seat or
   nuclear cargo. When the cargo, either palletized or non-palletized, is secured with chains, the
   30-inch spacing is not required. EXCEPTION: For patient access maintain a 30 inch
   spacing on Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) missions, when carrying litters patients regardless
   of type tiedown used.
13.4. Pre-Mission Duties.
   13.4.1. Cargo Missions:
       13.4.1.1. The loadmaster will coordinate with aerial port personnel to establish loading
       times. Loading times that differ from the normal pre-departure sequence of events will
       be established, with PIC coordination, before the loadmaster enters crewrest. Loading
       time is governed by the type of load and complexity of loading procedures (bulk,
       palletized, etc.) not by port saturation or management of aerial port workload levels.
       When reporting for duty, the loadmaster checks in with the air terminal operations center
       or other designated location to obtain load brief and assist in load planning as required.
          13.4.1.1.1. Duty Loadmaster Operations. Duty loadmasters are used as a means of
          flow control at stations with limited aerial port personnel, when units are deployed as
          part of an Expeditionary Airlift Squadron (EAS) or a tactical/contingency operation.
          Duty loadmasters do not relieve the primary aircrew loadmaster(s) of their duties.
          Duty loadmasters ensure items loaded on aircraft do not exceed aircraft limitations
          and adequate restraint is applied to cargo to prevent movement. Duty loadmasters are
          not required to restrain cargo for flight limits. Duty Loadmasters will accomplish an
          Exterior and Interior Safety Inspection, Basic Aircraft Pre-flight and all appropriate
          loading preparation checklists prior to conducting loading operations. After
          completion of aircraft loading, duty loadmasters will accomplish the BEFORE
          LEAVING AIRCRAFT Checklist unless maintenance personnel remain at the aircraft
          to monitor operating aircraft systems. Primary aircrew loadmaster(s) will, complete
          all pre-departure checklists to include the AFTER LOADING GENERAL Checklist.
              13.4.1.1.1.1. Upon arrival at an aircraft where loading operations are being
              directed by a duty loadmaster, the primary loadmaster will coordinate with the
              duty loadmaster on assumption of direct loading supervision.
          13.4.1.1.2. Aerial Port Expediter (APEX) Loading Operations. APEX is an aerial
          port loading program directly managed and supervised by HQ AMC/A4TC and
          validated by MAJCOM/Wing/Operations Group Stan/Eval Loadmasters. It provides
          aerial port management the flexibility to determine the best time to on/offload aircraft
182                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


         and the ability to evenly distribute port workloads. It will not serve as an aircrew
         enhancement or alleviate the loadmaster‘s responsibility to on/off load aircraft.
             13.4.1.1.2.1. APEX load directors are responsible for all loading operations IAW
             Technical Orders (TO) Air Mobility Command Instructions (AMCI) and related
             guidance. Load directors are qualified to on/offload all types of cargo, operate the
             aircraft winch, cargo door, ramp and struts without the presence of an aircraft
             loadmaster. A maintenance representative must be present at the aircraft during
             APEX operations, load directors are not authorized to apply/remove aircraft
             power or monitor aircraft operating systems.
             13.4.1.1.2.2. Load directors are required to ensure restraint of cargo meets flight
             criteria. Load directors will accomplish a basic cargo compartment inspection
             IAW current APEX guidance and appropriate loading preparation checklist prior
             to conducting loading operations. APEX operations do not alleviate the
             loadmaster from accomplishing applicable checklist.
             13.4.1.1.2.3. Load directors have overall control until relieved by the outbound
             loadmaster(s). A coordination briefing is required prior to the loadmaster
             assuming overall control.
             13.4.1.1.2.4. Loadmasters who need on/offloads for training or evaluations
             should notify ATOC prior to entering crewrest. ATOC should make every effort
             to accommodate the request.
             13.4.1.1.2.5. Loadmasters shall treat APEX loaded aircraft like any duty-loaded
             or staged aircraft. Any cargo discrepancies that cannot be corrected by the
             loadmasters in a timely manner will be reported to ATOC. Forward negative
             APEX trend data to AMC/A3VX through Stan/Eval channels.
      13.4.1.2. Proper cargo documentation will accompany each load. A consolidated
      statement (manifest) will be delivered to the aircraft prior to departure unless one is not
      available due to a lack or failure of the manifest processing equipment. In this case, a
      cargo listing or load plan with transportation control numbers (TCN) will accompany the
      load.
         13.4.1.2.1. Load Data Information (Applicable to AFRC/ANG completing 618 AOC
         (TACC)-directed mission). At stations where there is no mobility air transportation
         function, the aircrew will collect the required load information on each leg, and
         submit it to the first station, which has such a function. The report will be submitted
         on AF Form 4075, Aircraft Load Data Worksheet.
         13.4.1.2.2. AMC inspectors and aircrew are authorized access to all cargo containers
         placed on AMC aircraft except when accompanied by a letter signed by HQ AMC/A3
         or HQ AMC/A4TC for protected or sensitive shipments.
      13.4.1.3. Tiedown equipment will be exchanged on a one-for-one basis. If this is not
      possible, annotate the AF Form 4069, Tiedown Equipment Checklist.
      13.4.1.4. Fleet Service Checklist.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  183


         13.4.1.4.1. Loadmasters will make every effort to ensure that the AF Form 4128,
         Fleet Service Checklist, is signed by the fleet service representative and placed aboard
         the aircraft prior to departure.
         13.4.1.4.2. Annotate inventory changes in section III. Place item nomenclature,
         increase/decrease amounts, station, date, and reason for change.
  13.4.2. Passenger Missions: Maximize seat availability on all missions.
     13.4.2.1. Manifesting. Passenger service or airfield management personnel manifest
     passengers at locations with an AMC passenger processing activity.
         13.4.2.1.1. When 20 or more passengers/troops are planned, a pallet position shall be
         left open to accommodate palletized/floor loaded baggage.
     13.4.2.2. The PIC and loadmaster are responsible for ensuring all passengers are
     properly manifested.
     13.4.2.3. At locations without an AMC passenger processing activity it may be necessary
     for crews to perform passenger service functions at stations that do not have this
     capability. These functions include manifesting, anti-hijacking processing, and ensuring
     visa/passport requirements are met. When the aircrew accomplishes manifesting, anti-
     hijack-processing is completed by the aircrew IAW AFI 13-207, Preventing and
     Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking) (FOUO). Do not hesitate to contact 618 AOC
     (TACC/XOGX), Aerial Port Control Center (APCC); DSN 779-0350/0355, commercial;
     618-229-0350/0355, if any questions arise such as who may travel to specific locations or
     pass-port/visa requirements. Aircraft operating within other MAJCOMs which have
     operational C2 over that aircraft will contact the appropriate AMOCC for specific details.
     File a copy of the DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest, with the flight plan. If not filed
     with the flight plan, annotate the location of the manifest on the flight plan IAW AFI 11-
     202 V3.
     13.4.2.4. A passenger service representative or crewmember will assist passengers at the
     bottom of the steps/stairs, and the loadmaster will assist in seating passengers. DVs,
     passengers requiring assistance, and families should be boarded first to minimize
     separation. Make every effort to seat families together. Ensure that only adult, English
     speaking, physically capable, and willing passengers are seated next to emergency exits.
     To the maximum extent possible, do not seat passengers with infants, or children under
     15 years old, in seats adjacent to emergency exits. The loadmaster will brief those
     passengers seated next to troop door(s) and/or the forward emergency escape hatch on
     proper operation and to open the exit when directed. The intent of this briefing is to
     inform those passengers seated next to emergency exits of their duties and responsibilities
     in assisting the loadmaster(s)/crew during passenger/troop emergency egress.
     13.4.2.5. When children under the age of two are accepted as passengers, their sponsor
     has the option to either hold the child or place him/her in a Department of Transportation-
     approved Infant Car Seat (ICS). Although the use of ICS for children processed through
     AMC-owned or controlled terminals (including gateways) is no longer mandatory, all
     passengers (duty and space-A), regardless of age, are required to be assigned their own
     seat. This policy will provide an infant and their sponsor with a dedicated seat allowing
     the use of an ICS at the sponsors discretion; this mirrors current FAA (commercial)
 184                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


       standards. The FAA and USAF have banned the use of booster seats, harnesses, and vest
       child restraints.
          13.4.2.5.1. Passengers may hand-carry their ICS. If used, secure the ICS to the seat
          using the seat belt. Adults will not hold the ICS during any phase of flight. In the
          event of turbulence or emergency landing, it is highly recommended for infants to be
          secured in an ICS. To prevent blocking an exit route when palletized seats are used,
          the ICS will not be secured in an outboard seat.
       13.4.2.6. Decisions regarding eligibility or acceptance of a passenger with disabilities for
       flight need to be determined at the lowest level possible. Problems concerning eligibility
       or acceptance that cannot be resolved locally must be reported (circumstances,
       chronology, names, units, etc.) to HQ AMC/A4T. For time sensitive problems, telephone
       HQ AMC/A4TP DSN 779-4592 or 618 AOC (TACC/APCC).
       13.4.2.7. Download the baggage of no-show passengers and those removed from a flight.
       In the case of SAAM or exercise missions at non-AMC locations, coordinate with CRG
       or deploying unit CC to decide if downloading of baggage is necessary.
       13.4.2.8. RUSH baggage movement will be accomplished IAW AMCI 24-101 V14,
       Military Airlift Passenger Service. The loadmaster will ensure ATOC provides a copy of
       the AMC Form 70, RUSH Baggage Manifest, for the shipment of RUSH baggage.
          13.4.2.8.1. Aircrew will not accept unaccompanied baggage unless the baggage has
          been processed through Traffic Management Office (TMO) or Installation
          Transportation Office (ITO) and arrives to the aircraft as freight IAW AMCI 24-101.
          NOTE: Baggage that becomes separated from the owner becomes freight. Direct
          personnel to turn unaccompanied baggage over to TMO/ITO for proper manifesting.
          TMO/ITO requirements: 1) Complete DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/
          Shipping Document. 2) Ensure baggage is free of unsafe items.
       13.4.2.9. Ensure all food items are removed from the aircraft by fleet service and
       returned to the flight kitchen if an extended delay occurs. Ensure that a copy of AF Form
       3516, Food Service Inventory Transfer Receipt, is received from fleet service to relieve
       the loadmaster of meal accountability.
       13.4.2.10. Pillow and Blanket Distribution. Hand out pillows and blankets only when
       requested by passengers. At enroute locations, leave used pillows and blankets on seats
       for thru-load passengers. Do not mix used and unused pillows and blankets.
13.5. Passenger Handling.
   13.5.1. The loadmaster is a key figure in good passenger relations. The following rules
   should be observed:
       13.5.1.1. Address passengers by proper titles.
       13.5.1.2. Avoid arguments and controversial subjects, national or international politics,
       criticism of other personnel or organizations.
       13.5.1.3. Offer services or perform duties in a manner indicating a personal interest and
       willingness to help.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                 185


     13.5.1.4. When passengers are onboard, loadmasters occupying the forward loadmaster
     station will not position the seat or be distracted in a manner that would prevent them
     from immediately viewing or assisting passengers.
  13.5.2. Comments by the loadmaster and the manner in which they are made often determine
  passenger attitudes about the flight. Always remember that passengers are individuals;
  address them collectively only when making announcements.
     13.5.2.1. Ensure crewmember‘s entertainment media (magazines, DVD, etc.) are of an
     appropriate nature.
  13.5.3. In-flight Procedures:
     13.5.3.1. Passengers may move about the cabin after reaching cruise altitude; however,
     judgment must be exercised on the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at any
     one time. Encourage passengers to remain seated with their seat belts fastened. Due to
     concern for their safety, passengers are not allowed to lounge or sleep on/in or under
     cargo or baggage. Discourage passengers from congregating around galley, lavatory and
     crew bunk areas.

   reconfigured to on/ offload cargo (i.e., helicopter struts, exhaust stacks, cabs, etc.).
   13.9.6. On/offloading Procedures.
   13.9.7. Location of Tiedown Points.
   13.9.8. Comments.
13.10. Emergency Airlift of Personnel. (See Chapter 17).
13.11. Rucksacks. The following procedures apply to loading of rucksacks.
   13.11.1. In all cases, rucksacks will be loaded on the same aircraft as the individual.
   13.11.2. Transported units must ensure that adequate space is provided on the load plan and
   aircraft to ensure all personnel have an unobstructed path to evacuate the aircraft during an
   emergency.
   13.11.3. During administrative deployments, rucksacks may be loaded on deploying
   vehicles, palletized, or floor loaded. Placing rucksacks on the aircraft floor may increase
   loading and offloading times. Also, this method may require more space and reduce the
   number of personnel or equipment airlifted.
   13.11.4. During tactical deployments into a FOB/OB, rucksacks not loaded on vehicles will
   be carried by the individual onto the aircraft. Normally, floor space will be allocated on the
   aircraft load plan for floor loading rucksacks.
       13.11.4.1. When a flight is planned for a short duration, the following procedures apply:
          13.11.4.1.1. The troops may wear the rucksacks in the seat provided the seats are
          placed in the paratroop configuration.
          13.11.4.1.2. All troops must have quick release straps on their rucksacks.
          13.11.4.1.3. Troops will be briefed to leave their rucksacks on the seat if an
          emergency evacuation is necessary.
       13.11.4.2. The following procedures apply to transporting hazardous materials in
       rucksacks.
          13.11.4.2.1. Personnel will only be permitted to carry their basic combat load or
          individual issue of hazardous material when they will engage an enemy force
          immediately upon arrival. Personnel may retain small arms ammunition (cartridge
          for weapons, DOT 1.4) and nuclear, biological, and chemical equipment as long as it
          is retained in a carrier (i.e., bandoleers, pouches, bags). Weapons will remain clear
          until the aircraft has landed or as directed by the loadmaster.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                189


          13.11.4.2.2. Munitions and other hazardous materials placed in rucksacks, field
          packs, or other authorized containers, removed from their shipping container, must be
          adequately protected from accidental functioning. For airland troops and airdrop
          troops who are not rigged prior to takeoff, all carriers will be consolidated in one
          central location on the aircraft (as directed by the loadmaster) and distributed to
          personnel after landing. Paratroopers rigged prior to takeoff may retain individual
          carriers containing hazardous materials.
          13.11.4.2.3. The troop commander or load team chief will brief the loadmaster
          concerning the individual issue of hazardous materials. The loadmaster will brief the
          PIC.
          13.11.4.2.4. Hazardous materials identified for sustainment must be prepared and
          certified according to AFMAN 24-204.
13.12. Not Used.
13.13. Cargo and Material Handling Equipment (MHE) Issues.
   13.13.1. ATOC will coordinate with the shipper or maintenance to connect/disconnect cargo
   venting systems.
   13.13.2. Loadmasters are not authorized to connect/disconnect cargo venting systems.
13.14. Procedures for Loading Hazardous Cargo.
   13.14.1. Hazardous materials/cargo not properly packaged and documented in accordance
   with AFMAN 24-204 will be rejected for air shipment.
   13.14.2. Hazardous materials/cargo falls into many categories and the utmost precautions
   must be observed when handling or transporting these items. Load all hazardous material to
   permit easy access in-flight without moving other cargo. Load jettisonable hazardous
   material to facilitate jettisoning. Adhere to the following appropriate safety precautions
   when loading hazardous cargo as appropriate:
      13.14.2.1. Ventilate the aircraft.
      13.14.2.2. Placard the aircraft.
      13.14.2.3. Fire extinguishers must be available.
      13.14.2.4. Thoroughly inspect the cargo.
      13.14.2.5. Stow cargo away from heater outlets.
      13.14.2.6. Notify medical personnel in case of damage to radioactive materials.
      13.14.2.7. Use protective clothing and equipment
   13.14.3. Hazardous materials shipped in a freight container (EXAMPLE: ISU-90, conex
   etc.).
      13.14.3.1. Load plans must allow in-flight access in event of an emergency, or hazardous
      materials will be removed from the container. Some containers have built-in
      ―HAZMAT‖ access panels; however, when these containers are utilized, any hazardous
      materials must be positioned to permit access through the panel. Hazardous materials in
      the upper compartment of the container are inaccessible unless the adjacent pallet
 190                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


       position is left empty to facilitate opening the doors. If the person responsible for the
       container is not on board, the key or combination for locks on containers must be on the
       container adjacent to the lock or in the cargo manifest. EXCEPTION: See AMCH 11-
       214 or AFMAN 24-204 for hazardous cargo not required to be accessible in-flight.
   13.14.4. Lithium Batteries and Pyrotechnic Material (Class/Division 1.3G). Aircraft halon
   fire extinguishers are ineffective in fighting fires involving primary (non-rechargeable)
   lithium batteries and pyrotechnic material. Primary lithium batteries shipped as cargo or
   installed/contained in equipment and pyrotechnic material will not be accepted as cargo
   without the shipper providing a suitable fire extinguisher(s). For non-rechargeable lithium
   batteries this may be C02, Class D, or a specialized fire extinguisher (e.g., LITH-X). Dry
   chemical agent is preferred extinguisher for pyrotechnic material. These extinguishers will
   only help reduce the intensity of the fire until the lithium and pyrotechnic material expends
   itself. Aircraft halon fire extinguishers are suitable when transporting only rechargeable
   (lithium ion) batteries. Fire extinguisher requirements for non-rechargeable lithium batteries
   and pyrotechnic material do not apply to items being hand carried by troops during Chapter 3
   operations. NOTE: Aircraft potable water will not be used as a fire suppression system for
   lithium batteries or pyrotechnic material. Water presents a hazard to electronic equipment
   and, in less than a large quantity, is ineffective.
13.15. Silver Bullet Command And Control Module (CCM).
13.15.1. The airstream Silver Bullet CCM and Communications Module may be occupied
during any phase of flight except for takeoff and landing.
   13.15.2. The aircraft commander retains overall authority to remove personnel from the
   CCM and Communications Module when passenger safety may be jeopardized (in-flight
   emergency, combat threat environments etc.).
   13.15.3. Aircraft commanders will be responsible to ensure that the user of the Silver Bullet
   is briefed prior to the mission on the takeoff and landing occupancy restrictions as well as the
   potential for removal from the bullet should flight conditions warrant.
13.16. Senior Leader In-Transit Conference Capsule (SLICC) and Senior Leader In-
Transit Pallet (SLIP).
   13.16.1. Only qualified SLICC maintenance personnel will install/remove the SLICC
   vestibule and connect/disconnect SLICC electrical power.
       13.16.1.1. ADS palletized seats will not be loaded forward of the SLICC.
   13.16.2. A maximum of four operational SLIPS may be airlifted on a single aircraft.
       13.16.2.1. When multiple occupied SLIPS are used on the same aircraft, all SLIPS
       should be loaded into the same side of the logistics rails to simplify the inter-SLIP
       electrical connections.
   13.16.3. The SLIP may be transported as cargo in either the ADS or logistics rail system.
       13.16.3.1. When transported as cargo the SLIP will not be occupied at any time and will
       not be electrically powered.
   13.16.4. Palletized cargo positioned directly aft of the SLIP and secured with nets or straps
   requires a 30 inch spacing or buffer boards secured with chains.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                   191


   13.16.5. Conference capsule divan (sofa) seats will not be occupied during takeoff or
   landing.
   13.16.6. If passenger restraint is required during turbulence, passengers are limited in
   number to five in the conference capsule due to availability of seat belts.
   13.16.7. The SLICC berthing capsule shall not be occupied during critical phases of flight
   (takeoff, landing, and aerial refueling).
   13.16.8. Passengers may occupy all seats on the SLIP during all phases of flight.
      13.16.8.1. Seats must be facing forward or aft for takeoff and landing.
      13.16.8.2. Seat belts will be worn for takeoff, landing, and when the personnel advisory
      seat belt light is illuminated.
      13.16.8.3. Carry on items must be properly secured for takeoff and landing.
      13.16.8.4. Each seat will be equipped with an EPOS and a life vest (when required).
      13.16.8.5. Passengers will be briefed on location of emergency equipment and use of
      emergency equipment.
   13.16.9. SLICC conference and berthing modules power can be shut off immediately in the
   event of an emergency by pressing the red emergency shutdown switch on either the external
   power distribution panel or internal operator control panel of each module. Aircrews will
   familiarize themselves with the location of these emergency shutdown switches prior to
   transporting passengers in the SLICC modules.
   13.16.10. An emergency key located in a pouch by each entry door is available for use by
   aircrew personnel in the event that an emergency situation would require immediate access to
   a locked module.
13.17. Deficient CGU-1/B 5000 pound capacity tiedown straps.
   13.17.1. These straps appear similar to current authorized tiedown straps but do not contain
   any capacity stenciled on the strap. HQ AMC/A4 and item managers from the Defense
   Logistics Agency (DLA) have determined that this strap does not comply with the required
   military specifications and that the restraint capacity cannot be properly determined.
   13.17.2. The deficient devices can be identified by the following characteristics: ratchet
   device stamped PECK&HALE, LLC; CGU-1/B 5000 LBS CAP; and 94658 6MRW/1465B
   13.17.3. Do not use the affected tiedown straps for restraint. Remove any deficient devices
   found on the aircraft and turn them in to aerial port personnel for final disposition.

      process and should know what to expect when arriving at Dover.
      13.18.1.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Before departure to Dover AFB, the PIC will call the
      Dover Command Post Duty Officer at DSN 445-4211 and pass all known information to
      include delays, computer flight plan flying time, and concerns.
      13.18.1.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) Because of the amount of coordination required,
      aircrews will stick to the mission cut. If arrival time differs by more than 15 minutes
      notify command and control. NOTE: The deceased may have a uniformed service
      representative coming from an off base location to meet the aircraft and it is important to
      arrive as close as possible to the scheduled arrival time.
      13.18.1.4. (Added-DOVERAFB) Expect the following actions upon arrival. This
      process can take from thirty minutes to more than an hour, dependent on the number of
      transfer cases on board.
         13.18.1.4.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) After arrival at the designated parking location,
         the loadmaster will deplane for engine shutdown. Ensure the cargo door and ramp
         remains closed.
         13.18.1.4.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Customs/Agriculture inspectors will meet and
         clear the aircraft.
         13.18.1.4.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) After being cleared by customs/agriculture a
         dignified transfer process team comprised of Port Mortuary personnel will board the
         aircraft and prepare for transfer. Within 20 minutes to 1 hour the dignified transfer
         team will board the aircraft and start the transfer. The aircrew will remain in place
         and receive a duties briefing. Passenger service will coordinate with the Command
         Post Duty Officer, and passengers should be downloaded prior to the dignified
         transfer.
         13.18.1.4.4. (Added-DOVERAFB) After the transfer case is prepared for offload,
         open the cargo door and ramp.
         13.18.1.4.5. (Added-DOVERAFB) The carry team will assume their positions
         around the transfer case.
         13.18.1.4.6. (Added-DOVERAFB) When directed, the aircrew will form up at the
         end of the aircraft ramp allowing room for the transfer case carry team to maneuver.
         All actions by the aircrew for rendering respect to the deceased will be
         commanded/directed by a member of the dignified transfer process team.
         13.18.1.4.7. (Added-DOVERAFB) The dignified transfer process team member
         rendering honors will exit the aircraft and take up a position off the tail of the aircraft.
         13.18.1.4.8. (Added-DOVERAFB) The transfer case carry team will proceed with
         the (offload) dignified transfer of the human remains to waiting vehicles.
         13.18.1.4.9. (Added-DOVERAFB) After the last vehicle and the remaining
         dignified transfer process team members are off the flight line, aircrew members may
         resume normal duties (download passenger bags, etc.).
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  193


          13.18.1.4.10. (Added-DOVERAFB) Questions or comments on the proceedings
          should be addressed to the senior dignified transfer process team member.
   13.18.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Normal flight line activities (including but not limited to
   aircraft start, movement, maintenance, transiting vehicles, and cargo upload/download) are
   not permitted during DTs on the ―flight line sterile areas‖. This area is depicted in Figure
   13.1. Every effort should be made to minimize all noise and movement on the remainder of
   the ramp during DTs whenever possible. If aircraft movements, servicing, and/or
   loading/unloading will be required during a DT, the aircraft should be positioned as far away
   from the DT/outside the sterile area as possible to minimize DT impact.
   13.18.3. (Added-DOVERAFB) The sterile area depicted in Figure 13.1 defines the area
   where aircraft are not allowed to taxi during DTs, regardless of DT aircraft location. Taxiing
   at other locations on the airfield will be coordinated with the CP. During a DT, the CP will
   coordinate with aircrew, AFMAO, MOC and ATOC to help ensure normal operations
   continue to the maximum extent possible with minimal impact upon the DT. Takeoffs,
   landings, and approaches are permitted but should be conducted during DT pauses whenever
   possible.

                                           Chapter 14

                        FUEL PLANNING AND CONSERVATION

14.1. General. This chapter provides fuel planning procedures for all C-17 missions including
flight managed and local missions. Missions should be planned at altitudes, routes, and
airspeeds to minimize fuel usage.
   14.1.1. For all flight managed missions, the PIC, in consultation with the Flight Manager
   (FM) will ensure sufficient fuel is available on board the aircraft to comply with AFI 11-
   202V3. The FM will calculate a Required Ramp Fuel Load (RRFL) derived from the
   Advanced Computer Flight Plan (ACFP) that accounts for fuel required to the destination,
   alternate (if required), required reserves, and contingency fuel (unless on a local training
   mission). RRFL is annotated on the ACFP Block 10 Reqd Ramp (Ramp Fuel in the mission
   summary block on AAR flight plans). The PIC will verify the FM generated RRFL with
   aircraft Mission Computer (MC) performance prior to departure. The PIC is the final
   authority in determining final RRFL.
   14.1.2. Any mission where an ACFP is not available, the MC is the primary fuel planning
   reference.
   14.1.3. Additional fuel planning considerations can be found in TO 1-C-17-1-1 Performance
   Manual, TO 1C-17A-1-2 Mission Computer, and AFTTP 3-3.C-17, ch 6.
14.2. Fuel Requirements. This section augments AFI 11-202V3 fuel requirements.
   14.2.1. Alternate Selection.
       14.2.1.1. Plan fuel to an alternate only when AFI 11-202V3 or Chapter 6 of this
       regulation requires the filing of an alternate.
       14.2.1.2. Use the closest suitable airfield(s) meeting mission requirements (such as
       special requirements for hazmat or patients) and AFI 11-202V3 weather criteria. If two
       alternates are required, fuel plan to the more distant of the two.
       14.2.1.3. Alternate Selection Priority:
          14.2.1.3.1. Closest suitable military airfields within 75nms of destination
          14.2.1.3.2. Closest suitable civilian airfield within 75nms of destination
          14.2.1.3.3. Closest suitable airfield (military or civilian)
       14.2.1.4. For flight managed missions, FMs will provide a route of flight to the primary
       alternate if greater than 75 miles from the planned destination. This route of flight is only
       for providing an accurate fuel plan and is not part of the route of flight filed with ATC.
       14.2.1.5. The practice of selecting an alternate solely because it is in another weather
       system or selecting an alternate based on maintenance capability will not be used.
   14.2.2. Fuel Reserves.
       14.2.2.1. Plan a 45-minute fuel reserve at destination or alternate (when an alternate is
       required).
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                    195


       14.2.2.2. For all missions, calculate 15 minutes of contingency fuel, using destination
       gross weights. Contingency fuel is not considered reserve fuel. Contingency fuel may be
       consumed at any point during the sortie. Contingency fuel will be included in the initial
       RRFL calculation. EXCEPTION: Local training missions are not required to carry
       contingency fuel. If contingency fuel is carried on local training missions, it will not
       exceed 15 minutes.
       14.2.2.3. For remote destinations, holding in lieu of an alternate airport is authorized. In
       such situations, use 2+00 hrs reserve fuel (1+15 holding in lieu of an alternate and 0+45
       reserve).
       14.2.2.4. ACFPs will calculate reserves and contingency fuel as holding fuel. ACFPs
       will have 1+00 holding when combining 0+45 reserve and 0+15 contingency fuel (for
       remote destinations ACFP will have 2+15 holding, combining 2+00 reserve and 0+15
       minutes contingency fuel).
       14.2.2.5. Reserve and contingency fuel will be computed using consumption rates
       providing maximum endurance at 10,000 feet MSL at destination gross weight. If an
       alternate is required, compute using weight at the alternate destination.
       14.2.2.6. For remote destinations, reserve and contingency fuel, will be computed using
       the MC to calculate maximum endurance at FL200.
       14.2.2.7. CAT 1 fuel reserve is no longer required and will not be calculated.
       14.2.2.8. Table 14 1 shows Identified Extra fuel additions for mission planning.

KNOWN HOLDING DELAYS                                200 lbs/minute of expected delay
NOTES:
(1) Hold down fuel is added as a departure bias and will be calculated as if it is burned upon
reaching the top of climb. Hold down fuel will be annotated on the ACFP as ―Fuel D‖ at the
beginning of the ACFP and accounted for in the top of climb fuel block on the ACFP.
(2) Early descent fuel is added as an arrival bias and will be calculated as if it is burned on the
last leg of the flight plan. Early descent fuel will be annotated on the ACFP as ―Fuel A‖ at the
beginning of the ACFP and accounted for in the last leg fuel block on the ACFP.

       14.2.2.9. 2200 lbs of fuel will be calculated by ACFP and included in the Identified
       Extra block for Fuel Totalizer bias.
       14.2.2.10. FMs will calculate the ACFP with a fuel burn bias, specific to aircraft tail
       number. This bias will be annotated on the ACFP as ―DGDP‖. This bias is based on
       historical fuel burn data. Verify the fuel bias listed on the ACFP is correct and enter the
       value into the MC as a Fuel Factor (FF LSK 6L on the Performance Factors Page)
       14.2.2.11. Tankering fuel for convenience is prohibited. If FM planned tankered fuel is
       deemed operationally necessary, it will be included in the RRFL and included on the
       ACFP in the Identified Extra block.
       14.2.2.12. When filing an alternate located in Alaska or at latitudes greater than 59
       degrees (north or south) use standard holding fuel calculations.
       14.2.2.13. Local supplements will not dictate IAF or Top of Descent fuel.
14.3. Fuel Planning Procedures.
   14.3.1. Prior to departure, the minimum planned landing fuel at the primary destination is
   the greater of:
       14.3.1.1. 16,000 lbs or
       14.3.1.2. Required fuel reserve, fuel required to transit to alternate (if required),
       contingency fuel, and any authorized identified extra fuel.
   14.3.2. Fuel Calculations. PICs will verify the RRFL in the MC by ensuring all required
   planning data is input into the MC.
       14.3.2.1. If the MC calculates a destination fuel less than 16,000 lbs, generates an
       INSUFFICIENT FUEL message, or in the PIC‘s judgment, the RRFL is insufficient to
       complete the mission, the PIC will:
       14.3.2.2. Ensure the MC is properly programmed including any applicable drag
       indexes/factors into the performance factors page.
       14.3.2.3. Call the FM to identify and resolve discrepancies in fuel planning calculations.
       (PICs will not add any additional fuel without first consulting with a FM).
   14.3.3. When Actual Fuel Load (AFL) exceeds the RRFL by more than 5,000 lbs, defuel the
   aircraft to the RRFL.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                     197


       14.3.3.1. When there is a conflict between an on-time departure and defueling, the 618
       AOC (TACC) Deputy Director of Operations (DDO) or MAJCOM C2 equivalent will
       determine which takes precedence (OG/CC for training sorties).
   14.3.4. Equal Time Point (ETP) Calculation. Crews will determine if additional fuel must
   be added to the RRFL in the event of a depressurization/decompression at the ETP. Plan to
   transit to a recovery location at optimal cruise speed for the depressurization transit altitude.
   Plan to land at the recovery location with 0+30 minutes reserve fuel calculated IAW 14.2.2.5.
   14.3.4.1. ETP calculations are required on portions of routes when the total time between the
   Last Suitable Airfield (LSAF) and First Suitable Airfield (FSAF) is 3-hours or more. LSAF
   and FSAF selected for ETP calculations in ACFP are authorized for use in-flight.
       14.3.4.2. FSAF/LSAF are airports closest to the coast out and coast in route of flight that
       meet applicable destination alternate requirements except weather. Forecast weather
       conditions for LSAF/FSAF (ETA +/- 1 Hour) will meet or exceed minimums for the
       lowest compatible approach or 500/1, whichever is greater. If the LSAF/FSAF is not on
       the flight plan course, ACFP will use a point 90 degrees perpendicular from the LSAF
       and/or FSAF to the flight plan course to determine the total distance between LSAF and
       FSAF. Note: The closer the LSAF and FSAF are to the flight plan course the more
       accurate the ETP solution provided by ACFP.
       14.3.4.3. ACFP uses the following formula for calculating ETP:
TIME in hours (ETP-FSAF) = DISTANCE (LSAF to FSAF)
                            (WF2 – WF1) + 2(TAS)
       14.3.4.4. Transit from ETP to the recovery airfield should:
           14.3.4.4.1. Be planned at 25,000 feet MSL when passenger supplemental oxygen is
           available.
           14.3.4.4.2. Be planned at 10,000 feet MSL when passenger supplemental oxygen is
           not available. Crews must coordinate with Flight Managers when required
           supplemental oxygen is not available.
           14.3.4.4.3. If ACFP calculates additional fuel is required from the ETP, it will
           automatically be included into block 10.
           14.3.4.4.4. Plan on burning all other fuel.
   14.3.5. Not used.
   14.3.6. Once airborne: Change each destination and RZ alternate holding fuel (LSK 4L) to
   0+45 or 2+00 (if using holding in lieu of), and remove all ID extra except 2.2k (fuel totalizer
   bias) and authorized tankered fuel to reflect the aircrew‘s ability to use all, some or none of
   the contingency fuel.
       14.3.6.1. Inflight, if the MC generates an INSUFFICIENT FUEL message, recheck flight
       plan/performance factors for accuracy. If the MC is accurate consider divert options and
       contact a FM.
14.4. Fuel Conservation. It is Air Force policy to conserve aviation fuel when it does not
adversely affect training, flight safety, or operational readiness. Aircrew and mission planners
 198                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


will manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will
be considered throughout all phases of mission planning and execution. Comply with the
following whenever consistent with tech order guidance and safety:
   14.4.1. Fuel Loads. Excessive ramp and recovery fuel adds to aircraft gross weight and
   increases fuel consumption. Do not ferry extra fuel beyond optimum requirements for safe
   mission accomplishment and training objectives.
   14.4.2. Flight Planning. Aircrew and mission planners will optimize flight plans and flight
   routing for fuel efficiency.
   14.4.3. APU Use. Minimize APU use to the maximum extent possible. Early coordination
   may be required to ensure external power carts are available.
   14.4.4. Center-of-Gravity (CG). Load and maintain aircraft at an optimum CG, whenever
   practical, consistent with mission requirements and Flight Manual restrictions. See 1C-17A-
   1 Chapter 5 for optimum aircraft performance CGs for varying zero fuel weights.
   14.4.5. Taxi.
       14.4.5.1. Minimize the number of unnecessary stops on taxiways. Breakaway taxi thrust
       increases fuel consumption.
       14.4.5.2. Pushback/Tow Operations are fuel-preferred to Reverse Taxi.
       14.4.5.3. Consider engine out taxi when permitted by Flight Manual.
   14.4.6. Departure Planning. Consider use of opposite direction runway to reduce taxi and/or
   expedite departure routing if TOLD allows.
   14.4.7. Takeoff.
       14.4.7.1. Consider a rolling takeoff as well as DRT power when able. This saves fuel
       and engine wear.
       14.4.7.2. Clean up on schedule and do not delay gear and flap retraction.
       14.4.7.3. DRT takeoffs will be used unless dictated by performance, tactics, etc.
   14.4.8. Climb/Descent. In-flight procedures such as climb/descent profiles and power
   settings should also be considered for efficient fuel usage.
   14.4.9. Descent. The optimum descent is executed at idle power. Avoid early descents
   whenever possible.
   14.4.10. Weather Deviations. Attempt to coordinate for off-course deviation early so gross
   maneuvering is not required.
   14.4.11. Cruise techniques. Fly fuel efficient speeds and altitudes to the maximum extent
   possible. See paragraph 14.5 for specific procedures.
       14.4.11.1. ACFPs are optimized for fuel based upon wind, altitude, etc. Accepting a
       ―direct to‖ ATC clearance is not necessarily fuel or time advantageous. Crews will
       analyze all factors prior to accepting a ―direct to‖ clearance off the ACFP route. Fuel
       savings may be further optimized by using Mission Index Flying profiles.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                 199


   14.4.12. Approach. Fly most direct routing to arrival approach consistent with mission
   requirements.
   14.4.13. Holding. If holding is required, hold clean at the most fuel efficient altitude and
   request a large holding pattern. Hold at endurance or performance manual recommended
   holding speeds, conditions permitting.
   14.4.14. Parking. Consider using shortest taxi route and avoid double blocking when able.
14.5. Inflight Optimization.
   14.5.1. Cruise Altitude.
       14.5.1.1. After takeoff, aircrews should determine and request to cruise at their optimum
       altitude. Optimum altitude can be calculated with the Pilot‘s Performance Advisory
       System (PPAS) or IAW AMC approved checklist insert OPTIMUM CRUISE
       ALTITUDES if PPAS is not available.
   14.5.2. Cruise Speed.
       14.5.2.1. Aircrews will fly Maximum Range Cruise (MRC), adjusted for winds, as their
       normal cruise mach. MRC speed is the speed that will attain the maximum miles per unit
       of fuel at a given gross weight and altitude. MRC can be calculated with the Pilot‘s
       Performance Advisory System (PPAS) or IAW AMC approved checklist insert CRUISE
       MACH SELECTION if PPAS is not available. It is unnecessary to cruise at less than .70
       Mach unless necessary to avoid fuel starvation.
       14.5.2.2. Extenuating circumstances, such as fixed TOT‘s, ARCT‘s, PIFR slot times,
       etc., may require deviation from this guidance. The PIC retains authority regarding
       cruise mach and altitude selection.
       14.5.2.3. Optimize fuel savings by using Mission Index Flying (MIF) profiles to the
       maximum extent possible without sacrificing aircraft control, communications, or
       situational awareness. If additional crewmembers are onboard the aircraft, aircrews will
       use these crewmembers to access the PPAS program and to coordinate with the Pilot
       Flying as to optimized airspeeds and altitudes to request (if able according to ATC).
14.6. Computer     Flight    Plan. Reference    https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/
home.aspx?Filter=24920 for current ACFP examples and descriptions.
14.7. Tactical Fuel Planning.
   14.7.1. For tactical missions, ensure low level time and ground operations are accounted for.
   Select low level on the CFG/OPER page if applicable.
   14.7.2. For formation flights, wingmen select formation on the CFG/OPER page.
14.8. AAR Fuel Planning.
   14.8.1. Preflight Fuel Planning. Enter MC information IAW T.O. 1C-17A-1-2. Ensure that
   UNID EXTRA and STORED fuel for any RZ is greater than 0.0.
   14.8.2. In-flight Fuel Planning. For single and multiple AAR, PICs will compute recovery
   fuel requirements, and required on-load requirements. Reference AFTTP 3-3.C-17, chapter 6
   for AAR techniques.

                                          Chapter 15

                                      AIR REFUELING

15.1. General. This chapter establishes air refueling procedures and policy applicable to C-17
aircraft and aircrews and is in addition to those prescribed by the flight manual and other
applicable directives.
15.2. AAR Limitations.
   15.2.1. Tanker Autopilot. Tanker pilots will notify receiver pilots when any axis of the
   autopilot is not used. If a tanker pilot or receiver pilot is required to fly autopilot-off for
   training, the pilot flying the opposing aircraft will be qualified (N/A for FTU or Upgrade
   Training). Verbal notification and acknowledgement will take place between the tanker and
   receiver prior to conducting autopilot-off refueling.
   15.2.2. AAR Without Tanker Disconnect Capability. Without tanker disconnect capability
   means the boom operator cannot trigger an immediate disconnect. AAR will not be
   conducted after a loss of tanker disconnect capability. EXCEPTION 1: Fuel emergency
   situation. EXCEPTION 2: Contingency missions, JCS alert, ORI or CORI support missions
   under normal conditions when the refueling is essential for home base recovery, or for any
   real-world mission when authorized. NOTE: When conducting AR without tanker
   disconnect capability, limit contacts to the minimum number necessary to complete mission
   requirements. Do not accomplish any training, boom limit demonstrations, or practice
   emergency separations.
   15.2.3. Manual Boom Latching (MBL) (also referred to as Emergency Boom Latching
   (EBL), Override Boom Latching (OBL) and amplifier override). This is an emergency
   procedure. Normal tanker disconnect capability and automatic disconnect limits are
   inoperative. Use of this procedure must be authorized in the mission directive. C-17s are not
   authorized to conduct MBL training. NOTE: The boom operator and receiver pilot will
   coordinate all actions as required by applicable directives and checklists when making AAR
   contacts using emergency boom latching procedures.
   15.2.4. Reverse AAR procedures will be accomplished for operational necessity IAW TO 1-
   C-17A-1.
   15.2.5. Breakaways. Follow procedures in IAW TO 1-C-17A-1 and ATP-56(B). After the
   tanker terminates the procedure, coordinate clearance back to astern if additional contacts are
   required for mission accomplishment.
   15.2.6. Practice Emergency Separations:
       15.2.6.1. Follow ―Breakaways‖ guidance in para 15.2.5.
       15.2.6.2. Prior to the actual accomplishment of a practice emergency separation,
       coordination between the tanker pilot, boom operator, and receiver pilot is mandatory.
       Coordination will include when the separation will occur and who will give the command
       of execution. Pilots will verify the AR system is not in override. Tanker disconnect
       capability must be verified by a boom operator initiated disconnect prior to
       accomplishing the separation. Tanker disconnect capability will not be verified on the
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                      201


      same contact as the Practice Emergency Separation. NOTE: Practice emergency
      separations will terminate no lower than 500‘ below tanker altitude.
   15.2.7. Receiver AAR Training for Unqualified Receiver Pilots. (This includes flight pilots,
   and aircraft commanders refueling from the right seat.) In-flight training will be
   accomplished under direct IP supervision. The following procedures apply:
      15.2.7.1. The receiver pilot will inform and receive acknowledgment from the tanker of
      crew qualifications and anticipated training.
      15.2.7.2. For receiver pilot initial qualification or requalification, the receiver
      instructor/examiner pilot will be in one of the pilot seats with immediate access to the
      controls through all phases of the refueling from the astern position until back to at least
      100 feet in trail of the tanker.
   15.2.8. If a change of pilot control is made, the receiver aircraft will move back to at least
   the astern position except for immediate assumption of control by the instructor pilot.
   15.2.9. If a tanker or receiver seat change takes place, move back to at least 100 feet in trail
   of the tanker and to a point where the receiver pilot can maintain visual contact with the
   tanker until the seat change is complete.
   15.2.10. Tanker disconnect capability will be demonstrated by a boom operator initiated
   disconnect before conducting a limit demonstration. Tanker disconnect capability will not be
   verified on the same contact as the limit demonstration.
   15.2.11. Weather Limitations.
      15.2.11.1. Turbulence. Do not plan AAR if severe turbulence is forecast on the refueling
      track. Terminate refueling if moderate turbulence is encountered.
      15.2.11.2. Visibility. Do not close from 1 NM range (2 NM for receiver or tanker
      formations) unless you have visual contact with the tankers. Discontinue refueling if in-
      flight visibility is insufficient to continue safe refueling operations.
      15.2.11.3. AAR alternate airfields must meet the criteria of AFI 11-202V3 and Chapter
      14 of this instruction for alternate airports.
   15.2.12. NVG Use During AAR. Pilots may use NVGs during air refueling rendezvous to
   acquire the tanker but must remove goggles NLT one nautical mile from the tanker.
15.3. Communications Failure. Aircraft experiencing two-way communications failure during
the conduct of AAR shall continue flight in accordance with the following procedures:
   15.3.1. Receiver pilot may continue AAR using tanker visual signals.
   15.3.2. Squawk code 7600 for at least 2 minutes before exiting the track or anchor.
   15.3.3. Aircraft that have not received altitude instructions beyond the exit point shall exit
   the track or anchor at the lowest altitude specified in the clearance for the refueling portion of

15.4. Operational Reporting. As required by mission directive.
15.5. MARSA Applicability for Aerial Refueling. MARSA begins between the tanker and
receiver when the tanker advises ATC that it is accepting MARSA. MARSA is not an ICAO
recognized term. If in doubt as to what separation is provided by ATC, or what separation the
aircrew is responsible for, query the tanker and/or controlling agency.
   15.5.1. If MARSA has not been accepted by the tanker before the receiver reaches the air
   refueling initial point (RVIP), the receiver may be required to hold at the RVIP.
   15.5.2. Once the rendezvous is completed, headings and altitude assignments may be made
   with the tanker concurrence with MARSA remaining in effect.
   15.5.3. Upon completion of the rendezvous, receiver aircraft will remain within 3 miles of
   the tanker until MARSA is terminated.
   15.5.4. MARSA ends when normal separation standards are established, ATC accepts
   control at end of refueling and ATC advises MARSA is terminated.
15.6. Altitude Reservations. Refer to ATP-56B Part 1 Chapter 2.
15.7. Receiver Aircraft Commander Responsibilities.
   15.7.1. Receiver aircraft shall squawk normal when separation from the tanker is greater
   than 3 miles.
   15.7.2. Receiver aircraft will maintain two-way radio contact with ATC until cleared to the
   refueling block altitude, established in that block, and cleared to the AAR frequency by ATC.
   15.7.3. Receiver pilots will not rely on the tanker to obtain and read back oceanic clearance.
   To the maximum extent possible, receiver pilots should obtain their own, individual
   clearance from the oceanic control authority of the airspace in which they intend to operate,
   prior to entering oceanic airspace. Consider obtaining clearance and providing read-back
   prior to rendezvous and air refueling.
   15.7.4. Pilots will always ensure they obtain a stable, astern position (no closure or drifting
   back) prior to closing to the contact position. The astern position is approximately 50 feet aft
   and slightly below the tanker boom nozzle.
   15.7.5. Will ensure planned air refueling altitude is within aircraft formatting capability.
   15.7.6. PICs must receive permission from controlling authority (i.e., OG/CC, 618 AOC
   (TACC)) prior to accomplishing opportune AAR.
15.8. Tanker Aircraft Commander Responsibilities. Tanker PICs are responsible for:
   15.8.1. Remaining within the protected lateral, longitudinal, and vertical airspace of the
   refueling track or anchor including orbit patterns.
   15.8.2. Notifying the appropriate ATC facility of all altitudes vacated and not anticipated for
   further use by refueling aircraft. Such altitudes shall not be reoccupied without further ATC
   clearance.
   15.8.3. Receiver navigation, regardless of the number of tankers or receivers, after
   rendezvous completion through completion of refueling operations (AAR and MARSA have
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                       203


   been terminated) except when under control responsibility of a military radar facility while in
   an anchor area.
   15.8.4. Maintaining communications with the appropriate ATC facility. All communications
   during refueling operations, including those concerning the receivers, shall be between ATC
   and tanker. To the extent practical, receivers shall establish communications with the tanker
   prior to or when departing the RVIP on the specified AAR frequency. The tanker shall
   assume position reporting responsibility for the receivers upon rendezvous completion.
   15.8.5. Coordinating altitude and route clearance:
       15.8.5.1. From the ATC facility for receivers and tankers at least 5 minutes prior to
       refueling completion except when both aircraft are operating on an approved altitude
       reservation (ALTRV).
       15.8.5.2. Through the radar controller when operating in refueling anchors with military
       ground radar. At least 5 minutes prior to completing refueling operations, the military
       radar facility shall forward requests to the assigned ATC facility and subsequently relay
       ATC clearances for the tanker and receiver aircraft from the ATC facility.
       15.8.5.3. Tanker aircrews should not normally obtain oceanic clearances for receiver
       aircraft intending to operate in NAT oceanic airspace. This is a receiver aircraft
       responsibility.
   15.8.5.4. Tanker aircrews will not read back receiver aircraft oceanic clearance. This is a
   receiver AC responsibility.
   15.8.6. Vertically positioning aircraft prior to reaching the planned exit point, to facilitate the
   safe and efficient transfer of separation responsibility from the military, under the provisions
   of MARSA, to the ATC facility on completion of refueling operations. Vertical separation of
   receivers and tankers shall be accomplished within the assigned altitudes.
   15.8.7. Providing each receiver, upon request, with the aircraft's position at the completion
   of refueling operations. Additional information concerning amendments or changes to the
   receiver's ATC clearance shall also be provided as appropriate.
   15.8.8. Coordinating all refueling formation operations to ensure all aircraft are in proper
   post air refueling formation prior to cell breakup. Prior to terminating air refueling, the lead
   tanker will confirm all aircraft in the formation are in proper post air refueling position with
   required lateral/vertical separation.
15.9. ATC Clearance. AAR operations are normally conducted on tracks or anchor areas
published in DOD FLIP. Operational considerations may require AAR outside published areas or
within an ALTRV. The tanker aircraft commander shall receive specific ATC clearance from
the appropriate ATC facility for the following:
   15.9.1. Entry to/exit from assigned aerial refueling altitude block (except on an approved
   ALTRV).
   15.9.2. Altitudes requested for tanker and receiver aircraft upon completion of air refueling.
   15.9.3. Routing for each aircraft or formation flight when exiting the refueling track prior to
   or beyond the exit point, or different from the flight plan routing.
204                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


  15.9.4. Extending the refueling operations beyond the track or anchor exit point due to
  adverse winds, mission requirements, etc.
  15.9.5. Use of altitudes in excess of those for which specific clearance has been granted (i.e.,
  tobogganing).
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  205


                                          Chapter 16

                             COMBAT MISSION PLANNING

16.1. General. This chapter provides general combat mission planning guidance for planners
and aircrews, standardizing procedures for planning, briefing, and reviewing all missions.
Planners and aircrews will reference AFTTP 3-3.C-17 for additional mission planning guidance.
   16.1.1. Pilots will be given one full day of planning for any missions employing low-level
   operations.
   16.1.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Local Training, Off Station Trainers, Training Exercises and
   JA/ATT Missions. 436 AW crews will meet NLT the working day prior to mission
   execution to accomplish mission planning. It is highly recommended that 512 AW crews
   meet NLT the working day prior to mission execution. As a minimum the PIC will
   accomplish mission planning prior to mission execution following a thorough review of crew
   requirements. Loadmasters are highly encouraged to attend mission planning; squadrons
   may direct attendance. If unable to attend, the loadmaster will coordinate training
   requirements with the PIC prior to mission planning. The Mission Commander/PIC will
   release the crew(s) when planning is complete. 436/512 AW crews will coordinate all air
   refueling and ALZ scheduling/use through 436 OSS/OSO.
16.2. Assault Landing Zones (ALZ). Landing zone size, lighting patterns, and composition
criteria are contained in AFI 13-217.
   16.2.1. Plan approaches to the ALZ IAW AFTTP 3-3.C-17 and the airfield identification
   procedures published in the OPORD or SPINS. Brief any deviations from approaches
   described in AFTTP 3-3.C-17. Where multiple options are available, select the approach
   which best minimizes exposure to the threat while still allowing a high probability of landing
   on the first approach.
   16.2.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Aircrews should analyze the objective area (runway or
   ALZ) by using all available resources (e.g., current CHUM'd chart, satellite imagery, ASRR,
   and LZ survey) to identify terrain and other hazards within 10 NM of the arrival airfield.
16.3. Route Planning. To the maximum extent possible, crews should follow guidance listed in
AFTTP 3-3.C-17.
   16.3.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Tactical Route Review/Approval. Coordinate with Wing
   Tactics prior to planning random low-level routes. Low-level routes will be planned to make
   maximum use of established MTRs. All planned low-level routes, local and off-station, not
   published in FLIP AP/1B, will be drawn on an aeronautical chart (PFPS product suffices as
   long as all Airspace, SUAS, and MTRs are depicted) and approved by Wing Tactics
   personnel NLT one duty day prior to mission departure. Missions that require ALTRVs and
   (or) a flimsy will have low-level routes submitted to 436 OSS/OSK NLT 1 duty day prior to
   mission departure. A copy of the chart and computer generated Flight Logs will be given to
   and maintained by 436 OSS/OSK when the route is approved. These routes will be flown as
   approved. If significant changes are required, the random low-level will be re-coordinated or
   cancelled.
 206                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


16.4. Low Level En Route Altitude Restrictions. The following altitudes are the minimum
established for C-17 operations. FLIP/ICAO procedures, training considerations, terrain, or
operational directives may dictate higher altitudes.
   16.4.1. Day VMC is 300 feet AGL, modified contour.
       16.4.1.1. Fly modified contour by using radar altimeter, HUD, and visual references.
   16.4.2. Night VMC is an indicated altitude of 500 feet above the highest obstruction to
   flight, or 400 feet plus one chart contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour,
   whichever is higher, within 3 NMs of planned route centerline. See Figure 16.2
       16.4.2.1. If the altitude for the next leg is higher than the current leg altitude, climbs will
       be completed before the turn point. If the altitude for the next leg is lower, do not initiate
       descent until after the turn point.
       16.4.2.2. Legs may be segmented to allow flight closer to the ground. Once the
       obstruction is visually identified and the aircraft can maintain well clear, laterally and/or
       longitudinally, the crew may descend to the next segmented altitude, if lower.
   16.4.3. NVG altitude is an indicated altitude of 500 feet above the highest spot terrain
   elevation, or 400 feet plus one chart contour interval above the highest depicted terrain
   contour, whichever is higher, within 3 NM of planned route centerline.
       16.4.3.1. NLT 3NM prior to any charted man-made obstacle within 3NM of centerline,
       the aircrew must visually identify the obstacle. If the obstacle is not identified by 3 NM,
       climb to 500‘ above the obstacle until the aircrew confirms the aircraft is past the
       obstacle, or until the crew can identify the obstacle and maintain well clear, laterally
       and/or longitudinally.
       16.4.3.2. If the altitude for the next leg is higher than the current leg altitude, complete
       the climb prior to the turn point. If the altitude for the next leg is lower than the current
       leg, do not initiate descent until over the turn point.
       16.4.3.3. Legs may be divided into segments for night altitude computations, depending
       on terrain differential or threats in order to allow flight closer to the terrain. Once the
       controlling obstacle or terrain feature is visually identified and the aircraft is confirmed
       well clear, the crew may descend to the next segmented altitude.
NOTES:
1. ANP 1.0 (MC FOM of 5) or less is required in order to fly lower than MSA at night.
2. Route centerline includes the aircraft turn radius over each turn point.
3. Obstruction to flight is defined as man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot elevation.
4. If the route has been planned on a JOG and night altitudes are verified, the route may be
flown with the lower altitudes when flying with reference to a TPC.
5. DTED information may be referenced in determining low level altitudes.


   16.4.4. Minimum Safe Altitude ( MSA) is 1000 feet above the highest obstruction within 5
   NMs of planned route centerline.
       16.4.4.1. MSA is an initial VFR altitude that provides additional terrain clearance.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                      207


      16.4.4.2. MSA will be computed for each leg or route segment or entire low level route.
   16.4.5. Minimum IFR En Route Altitude is 1000 feet above the highest obstruction within 5
   NMs of planned route centerline (2000 feet in mountainous terrain)
      16.4.5.1. This altitude should be rounded off to the next higher 100-foot increment.
      16.4.5.2. If the altitude for the next leg is higher than the current leg altitude, climbs will
      be completed before the turn point. If the altitude for the next leg is lower, do not initiate
      descent until after the turn point.
      16.4.5.3. Minimum altitudes for IFR operations within published Military Training
      Routes (MTRs) in US sovereign airspace will be computed leg minimum IFR En Route
      Altitude unless a higher altitude is required by FLIP AP/1B. The min IFR altitude may be
      above the top of the MTR leg altitude. In this case, the aircraft will slow to 250 KCAS or
      less, contact ATC and coordinate an alternate clearance. EXCEPTION: After thorough
      route planning by the crew and approval from the wing tactics office and OG/CC, aircraft
      may fly the top of the block on an MTR when that altitude is less than Min IFR en route
      altitude. For multiple use local MTRs, OGV will issue local approval and restrictions in
      their unit supplement to this instruction.
   16.4.6. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). ESA is 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous
   terrain) above the highest obstruction to flight within 22 NMs of planned route centerline.
      16.4.6.1. Several ESAs may be computed for route segments transiting significant terrain
      differentials or a single ESA may be computed for the entire low level route.
      16.4.6.2. Climbing to ESA may put the aircraft or formation in a controlled (i.e., IFR)
      altitude structure and require coordination with Air Traffic Control agencies. NOTE:
      Mountainous terrain as defined in AFI 11-202V3.

Figure 16.1. Inherent Chart Errors.
 208                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


WARNING: Aeronautical charts do not depict man-made obstacles less than 200 feet AGL or a
change in terrain until it exceeds the chart contour interval. The worst situation would occur if a
199-foot tower sat on terrain with an elevation just below the next higher contour. For a TPC
(1:500,000) with a contour interval of 500-feet, this results in an uncharted obstacle existing 698
feet above charted terrain. Additionally, the highest spot elevation on any given leg may not be
the highest terrain as in the case of gradually rising elevations. Planners will ensure accurate
terrain analysis by evaluating both spot elevations and the highest contour level.

CAUTION: Some charts may depict terrain and obstacle altitudes in meters versus feet (e.g.
JOG and TLM charts in some areas of the world).

Figure 16.2. Night VMC En Route Altitude.




   16.4.7. Temperature Correction. For all low level operations, temperature corrections will
   be applied to the minimum IFR and Night enroute altitudes. Apply corrections IAW the
   temperature correction chart provided in the FIH to ensure adequate obstacle clearance. Add
   the values derived from the FIH temperature correction chart to the IMC and Night minimum
   enroute altitudes whenever the outside air temperature is 32°F/0°C or below.
16.5. Peacetime Route Restrictions. In addition to restrictions in AFI 11-202V3, specific
country or theater of operations publications, and FLIP area planning, routes should not be
planned or flown:
   16.5.1. With less than 1 NM separation (3 NMs when in excess of 250 KCAS) when below
   2000 feet AGL from known sensitive environmental (i.e., hospitals, fish hatcheries, large
   poultry complexes, recreation areas, institutions, etc).
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                 209


   16.5.2. With less than 3 NMs separation from prohibited airspace.
   16.5.3. With less than 3 NMs separation from nuclear power plants.
   16.5.4. Through restricted airspace without clearance.
   16.5.5. Below 1000 feet AGL within a 2000 feet radius over cities or towns shown as
   magenta shaded areas on 1:500,000 (TPC) scale charts in addition to the restrictions in AFI
   11-202V3 chapter 5.
   16.5.6. Over or through active live fire or impact areas that may not be specifically
   designated as prohibited or restricted areas.
   16.5.7. Below 500 feet AGL unless:
       16.5.7.1. Host nation rules specifically allow such VFR operations.
       16.5.7.2. Routes or training areas have been environmentally assessed and surveyed for
       300-foot AGL operations. This restriction does not apply to one-time-use routes. Consult
       FLIP AP/1B for published Military Training Route restrictions.
16.6. Navigation Chart Preparation. Low-level navigation charts will be updated and
annotated with the most recent CHUM or supplement. In no case will CHUM coverage be less
than 22 NMs either side of the entire planned route centerline. Crews may trim charts to no less
than 10 NMs of the planned route centerline after establishing the ESA. CAUTION: 1:50,000
and smaller scale maps do not depict aeronautical information, may not show man-made
obstacles, and are rarely updated through the CHUM.
   16.6.1. Chart Annotation. Individual chart annotations will have, as a minimum, turn points,
   IP, objective area, course line, navigation information, CHUM data and date, ESA and chart
   series/date. Reference AFTTP 3-3.C-17 for standard chart preparations.
16.7. Route Study. Crew route study is mandatory before accomplishing flight in the low level
environment. The route study will include, at a minimum:
   16.7.1. Route overview.
   16.7.2. Obstacles/obstructions along the planned route.
   16.7.3. Leg information (e.g. course, altitudes, and controlling obstacles).
   16.7.4. Low level hazards and mitigation.
   16.7.5. Terrain features.
   16.7.6. Individual crew member responsibilities/duties.
   16.7.7. Discussion of any airspace restrictions.
   16.7.8. ESA controlling obstacle and location.
16.8. Airlift Support Forces Coordination. Ensure coordination is complete with airlift and
supporting forces.
16.9. Briefings. The PIC will ensure all applicable briefings and de-briefings are completed for
each mission. Brief applicable items in sufficient detail to ensure a clear understanding of
mission objectives and procedures. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all crewmembers are
briefed on applicable mission items.

                                          Chapter 17

                 MISSION EMPLOYMENT/TACTICAL PROCEDURES

17.1. General.
   17.1.1. Refer to AFTTP 3-1.C-17 and AFTTP 3-3.C-17 for mission employment and tactical
   procedures.
17.2. Tactical Checklists. Initiate the Combat Entry Checklist so it will be completed prior to
entering the combat area. Execute the Combat Exit Checklist after vacating the combat area.
These checklists will be executed for all airdrop and tactical airland missions.
   17.2.1. As a minimum, the PF, PM and primary LM will remain on interphone from
   initiation of the Combat Entry Checklist until completion of the Combat Exit Checklist,
   unless crew duties require otherwise.
   17.2.2. Personnel performing duties requiring them to be mobile in the cargo compartment
   during airdrop, low level operations, or threat environments will wear protective headgear.
   All other personnel in the cargo compartment will be seated with seat belts fastened.
   17.2.3. During accomplishment of tactical checklists, do not change IFF or CALLSIGN X
   until appropriate FIR boundaries have been transited or as directed by ATC.
17.3. Tactical Descents, Arrivals and Departures.
   17.3.1. Formation tactical descents are limited to VMC, 3-ship formations and a minimum of
   6,000‘ spacing between aircraft.
   17.3.2. Unless operational necessity dictates, limit tactical descents to comply with all
   required airspace speed restrictions except as directed by T.O. 1-1C-17A-1 (i.e. 250KIAS
   below 10,000 ft).
17.4. Ground Operations.
   17.4.1. NVG Lighting During Ground Operations without Combat Lighting. Operating
   landing lights with IR lens covers for more than 5 minutes on the ground will cause damage
   to the lights/covers.
   17.4.2. NVG Taxi/Backing. Pilots may taxi using NVGs on airfields without lights (blacked
   out) or equipped with overt or covert lights. If taxiing or accomplishing ground ops on
   blacked out taxiways/ runways/ramps, the Aircraft Commander will ensure aircraft or
   environmental lighting provides for clear definition of taxiway/runway/ramp edge. Comply
   with all taxi restrictions in Chapter 5 and the ASRR. The LM may provide the pilot with
   directions to taxi the aircraft while using NVGs.
   17.4.3. Engine Running Onload and Offload (ERO) Procedures. WARNING: Do not
   onload or offload through the crew entrance door and cargo ramp/door at the same time
   unless both doors are directly supervised by a C-17A qualified crewmember. Troop doors
   will not be used. WARNING: If a combat offload is to be accomplished before offloading
   vehicles, do not remove restraint until after the combat offload is completed. WARNING:
   When EROs are accomplished through the cargo ramp and door, engines will be placed in
   reverse idle prior to the pilot giving clearance for off/onload operations. If a thrust reverser
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  211


  will not extend, consideration should be given to shutting down the affected engine. NOTE:
  With exception of small arms ammunition (hazardous division 1.4) do not ERO explosive
  cargo unless authorized by mission directive.
     17.4.3.1. Vehicle parking brakes will not be released until all restraint is removed and
     cleared by the loadmaster.
     17.4.3.2. Personnel to be offloaded will be briefed to secure baggage aboard vehicles (if
     applicable).
     17.4.3.3. Vehicles and all personnel exiting via the ramp will proceed directly aft of the
     aircraft at least 25 feet before turning and at least 200 feet before stopping.
     17.4.3.4. The loadmaster will direct all onload and offload operations using briefed
     signals. Other qualified loadmasters (CRG, aerial port) may perform these duties;
     however, the crew‘s primary loadmaster retains overall responsibility for the operation.
     Passengers will be escorted by a crewmember, CRG, Aerial Port, or airfield control (i.e.,
     STT, DACG) personnel when enplaning or deplaning. Deplane passengers before
     removing cargo and enplane after loading cargo unless cargo size and location dictates
     otherwise.
     17.4.3.5. Load Data. If cargo/passenger onload information can be obtained prior to
     landing/ onload, complete the DD Form 365-4 for the subsequent sortie. The loadmaster
     may use the load plan total weight and load center of balance (CB) for entry on the DD
     Form 365-4 provided these procedures are followed:
     17.4.3.6. The load plan data will be checked by a qualified load plan validator (i.e.
     aircraft loadmaster, CRG loadmaster, aerial port specialist, or any individual who has
     completed the AMC Affiliation Program Airlift Planners Course). NOTE: If
     downloading to an empty aircraft, a DD Form 365-4 is not required for the subsequent
     sortie.
     17.4.3.7. Crew Entrance Door ERO Procedures. The PIC may approve the offload or
     onload of personnel and small cargo through the crew entrance door. In this instance, the
     throttles may be positioned to idle or reverse idle. Deplane the loadmaster to assure safety
     of deplaning/enplaning of personnel.
     17.4.3.8. Reduced Lighting EROs. Reduced light EROs must be accomplished with
     red/NVIS (overt) lighting in the cargo compartment sufficient to permit MHE drivers to
     see marshaller‘s signals and safely position MHE. NVGs will not be used for positioning
     MHE for on/off-loading operations. Dimming rheostat will be set to minimum amount of
     lighting to accomplish LMs duties. LMs may use NVGs to maintain situational
     awareness of the load team behind the aircraft before and after actual loading.
  17.4.4. Combat Offload Procedures. On operational missions, the controlling
  MAJCOM/A3/DO (or DIRMOBFOR for chopped assets) may authorize combat offloads
  when conditions warrant. OG/CC may approve combat offloads on training missions
  following a thorough risk assessment. WARNING: Many explosive items have specific
  "drop" criteria that, if exceeded, render the item useless or dangerous to the user. Small arms
  ammunition (Hazard Class/Division 1.4) and explosives and munitions rigged for airdrop do
  not need additional approval; however, any other explosives and munitions shall not be
 212                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   combat offloaded without additional approval of MAJCOM/A3/DO.                        CAUTION:
   Excessively rough, sharply undulating or battle damaged surfaces may cause damage to the
   aircraft during combat offload operations. Reducing forward taxi speed on these surfaces will
   reduce air-craft oscillation. The PIC will ensure the offload area will permit the offload
   operation to be conducted without damage to the aircraft. CAUTION: The PIC is ultimately
   responsible for ensuring the area in front and behind the aircraft is clear during the operation.
   The loadmaster will ensure the area behind the aircraft is well clear of anything which may
   be damaged due to engine exhaust blast. CAUTION: To combat offload, a surface of at
   least 1,000 feet is required; however, 1,500 feet is desired to provide a margin of safety.
       17.4.4.1. Ensure the crew rest window to the cargo compartment is clear of obstructions
       for combat offload operations.
       17.4.4.2. If ground personnel are present, the loadmaster will make contact with the
       individuals to ensure no one disrupts the operation. After the area is clear and secure, the
       loadmaster positions for the offload.
       17.4.4.3. All combat offloads will be accomplished from the forward loadmaster station.
       NOTE: If combat offloading to an empty aircraft, a DD Form 365-4 is not required for
       the subsequent sortie.
       17.4.4.4. NVG Combat Offloads. Pilots and loadmasters may accomplish Combat
       Offloads on NVGs at airfield light levels down to and including blacked out, provided
       aircraft or airfield lighting permit clear definition of taxiway/runway/ramp edges. Cargo
       compartment lighting will be set at minimum level to perform loadmaster duties safely.
17.5. Emergency Airlift of Personnel. Use these procedures for emergency airlift of personnel
from areas faced with enemy siege or hostile fire; or use these when directed by the controlling
component commander, MAJCOM/A3/DO or DIRMOBFOR. Airlift of this nature will normally
be accomplished without the use of individual seats, seat belts, or litter stanchions. Passengers
will be seated on the cargo floor/ramp. The number of personnel will vary depending on size and
the number of tiedown straps on board the aircraft. An estimate of 200 personnel on the main
floor and 25 on the ramp can be used for planning purposes. Personnel may be loaded in groups
of 12 to 16 (depending on size). The following procedures will apply:
   17.5.1. All Rails and roller conveyors will be stowed. Four ramp toes installed in the high
   position.
   17.5.2. When available, mattresses or other cushioning material may be used for seating.
   17.5.3. Troops, passengers, and ambulatory patients will be seated facing forward on the
   cargo floor or ramp.
       17.5.3.1. Attach the hook end of tiedown straps to tiedown rings in A and G rows.
       Position personnel laterally between attached straps. After personnel are seated, route
       straps laterally across their legs and secure ratchet end of straps to the tiedown ring in D
       row. Be cautious of making strap too tight to restrict blood circulation in the legs of
       passengers.
   17.5.4. The standard weight of 315 lbs per passenger should be used. (includes individual,
   equipment worn, carry-on bags and floor loaded bags).

      17.5.4.1. Secure baggage on the ramp when excess baggage and cargo secured on the
      cargo floor (or a pallet) may decrease the number of troops, passengers, and patients
      proportionately.
   17.5.5. The maximum altitude for emergency airlift will not exceed FL250.
   17.5.6. Consideration must be given for additional aircrew flight equipment if passenger
   count exceeds aircraft configuration.
   17.5.7. For airlift of patients, see Chapter 20 of this instruction.
17.6. (Added-DOVERAFB) Aircraft Defensive Systems.
   17.6.1. (Added-DOVERAFB) Units will not transport built-up flares (magazines
   containing flares with squib installed). Only the aircraft's defensive system dispensers can
   contain built-up flares. Transport spare flares as hazardous cargo and process for air
   shipment in accordance with AFJMAN 24-204.
   17.6.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) Halon, carbon dioxide, or water-type fire extinguishers will
   not be used on fires involving pyrotechnics or magnesium incendiaries due to the risk of
   explosions.
17.7. (Added-DOVERAFB) Flight Deck Armor. During missions not requiring armor,
pieces that restrict seat movement may be removed and will be properly secured.

                                 AIRCRAFT FORMATION

18.1. General. Formation procedures will be conducted IAW this chapter and TO1C-17A-1.
Aircrews will follow formation standards described in AFTTP 3-3.C17 Chapter 8 Formation
Operations, unless otherwise briefed. Consider safety, aircrew capability, proficiency,
survivability and user requirements when planning any formation. WARNING: Vortices
generated during departure, airdrop, and recovery can be significant in size, duration, and
velocity. Due to the potential hazards, aircrews will be aware of their existence and attempt to
avoid them. NOTE: Aircraft may alter position slightly to avoid vortices from preceding
aircraft.
18.2. Specified Times. The mission commander determines the sequence of events and mission
times based on ATO, FRAG, planning, staff input, fuel requirements, passenger/jumper comfort,
taxi distances, briefing requirements, etc.
18.3. Weather Minimums.
   18.3.1. Takeoff. Takeoff minimums are no lower than 200 foot ceiling and one-half mile
   visibility (RVR 2400). If the departure ceiling or visibility is below published approach
   minimums, the formation may takeoff if the requirements for a departure alternate (IAW
   Chapter 6 of this instruction) are met.
   18.3.2. Landing. Landing minimums are the published minimums for the airport navigation
   aid used, but no lower than 200 foot ceiling and one half-mile visibility. NOTE: Formation
   NVG landing minimums are in accordance with Chapter 6.
18.4. Ground Operations. The minimum taxi interval is one aircraft length.           Lead may
increase the taxi interval if circumstances dictate.
18.5. Takeoff. For takeoff, aircraft feed onto the runway individually. The takeoff EPR rating
(i.e., DRT or MAX) will be briefed and all aircraft should takeoff with the same EPR rating.
   18.5.1. The minimum takeoff interval is 30 seconds. It is possible at high power settings to
   cause a FOD hazard to following aircraft, so plan departure spacing accordingly. Begin
   timing for takeoff interval when the preceding aircraft starts its takeoff roll.
   18.5.2. For aborts during takeoff, a briefed crew member (normally a loadmaster)
   immediately transmits position number aborting three times on interplane frequency (i.e.,
   "Thug 70, number two aborting, number two aborting, number two aborting."). The PM
   transmits the same abort call on runway controlling frequency (after completing emergency
   procedures requiring immediate action). The aborting aircraft clears the runway as safety
   allows. Succeeding aircraft, if not on takeoff roll, hold until the runway is clear and a new
   takeoff clearance is obtained. Any aircraft on takeoff roll will abort their takeoff. NOTE:
   Use of secure interplane may inhibit reception of an abort call. Consider using unsecure
   communications for takeoff in case an abort call is necessary.
18.6. Altimeter Setting. Formation leaders will pass altimeter changes throughout the mission.
18.7. Bank Angles, Airspeeds, and Rates of Ascent/Descent. Standard airspeeds and rates of
ascent/descent are depicted in AFTTP 3-3.C-17 Formation Operations Chapter. These standards
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                    215


will be followed unless otherwise briefed. Lead is limited to MIN/20 degrees of bank when
using SKE/FFS. Element leads will select NORM/20 for turn rate and bank angle on the AFCS
panel when flying SKE/FFS.
18.8. Radio Discipline. Limit transmissions to those required for safety or control of the
formation. NOTE: HAVE QUICK and secure communications should be used when available.
18.9. Airborne Aborts (Departure, Enroute and Element Lead Abort). Any aircraft that
cannot maintain formation position will notify lead of the nature of the emergency and
intentions. If the emergency does not permit maintaining position until an individual clearance is
obtained, establish a safe heading away from the formation and maintain visual or SKE contact.
If unable to maintain visual or use SKE, the use of A/A TACAN, TCAS, or radar skin paint may
aid in maintaining separation from the formation. After departing the formation, the aborting
aircraft will climb or descend out of the formation altitude prior to maneuvering across the flight
path of the formation.
   18.9.1. Departure. Aircraft aborting during assembly will execute the briefed emergency
   procedures, hold clear of departing traffic, maintain VMC if possible, notify lead, and contact
   the appropriate controlling agency. If possible, the aborting aircraft will remain clear of the
   formation until a landing can be made without interfering with the remainder of the departing
   formation.
   18.9.2. En Route. Aircraft that abort after assembly will turn away from the formation and,
   with mission commander‘s concurrence, may proceed to a suitable recovery airfield or rejoin
   at the end of the formation.
   18.9.3. Element Lead. If an element lead aborts the formation, the second aircraft of that
   element moves to the element lead position. If a formation is flying a three-ship element,
   aircraft within the element may move up to maintain a two-ship element.
       18.9.3.1. For SKE formations, the appropriate follower aircraft select the new lead,
       positively identify the new leader on the SKE MFD, reset cross-track and range as
       required, and request an FCI check (as time allows) from the new element leader. If
       necessary, accomplish MASTER change (SKE w/o FFS) prior to departing the formation.
       Normally, slot numbers and call signs do not change due to an aircraft abort.
18.10. Visual Procedures. Visual formation geometry will be driven by the tactical situation,
which is determined by the threat environment, terrain, mission requirements and other factors.
For a complete description of visual geometries reference AFTTP 3-3.C-17. Choose the
geometry that gives the best tactical advantage. Different formation geometries may be required
through the course of the mission. Flight leadership is critical to the success of these tactics.
   18.10.1. Departure and Assembly. After crossing the field boundary, wingmen adhere to air
   traffic control requirements and close to en route position. Lead maintains assembly
   airspeed, until briefed acceleration time/point.
   18.10.2. Acceleration. Commence timing for acceleration when lead starts his takeoff roll.
   At acceleration time/point, lead accelerates to attain climb/enroute airspeed.
   18.10.3. Late Take Off. Aircraft joining a formation en route will contact lead and rejoin as
   briefed/directed. The rejoining aircraft will remain at least 500 feet above or below the
   formation until the formation is in sight and cleared to rejoin.
216                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


  18.10.4. En Route Procedures:
      18.10.4.1. Spacing. Plan a minimum of 2000 feet spacing within each element and
      12,000 feet between elements.
      18.10.4.2. Minimum Altitude.
         18.10.4.2.1. Day VMC. Formation lead flies modified contour by using radar
         altimeter, HUD, and visual references. Element leads/wingmen use a combination of
         the above and reference to other aircraft.
         18.10.4.2.2. Night VMC. Formation lead maintains altitude by reference to the
         barometric altimeter. Element leads/wingmen use a combination of barometric
         altimeter and reference to other aircraft.
      18.10.4.3. Airspeed. Leads will announce unplanned airspeed changes greater than 10
      knots.
      18.10.4.4. Inadvertent Weather Penetration (IWP). Formation leads will make necessary
      actions to not take a VFR formation into the IMC conditions. If clouds and/or areas of
      poor visibility are inadvertently entered by a formation operating under VFR, the primary
      concern of the formation lead is to provide safe aircraft separation and terrain clearance.
      Wingmen will immediately notify lead of deteriorating visual conditions if they occur.
      Terminate these procedures if the entire formation attains VMC, terrain clearance, and
      positive separation from other formation aircraft. WARNING: It may be necessary to
      modify these procedures due to formation geometries other than visual in-trail, terrain,
      airspace restrictions, etc. Inadvertent weather penetration in mountainous terrain using
      these procedures may be hazardous. Mission planners should brief procedures that best
      suit the situation. NOTE: The following procedures are for emergency use and do not
      constitute authority to violate AFI 11-202V3 or Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR).
      Exercising these procedures under actual weather conditions is a violation subject to
      appropriate action by USAF and FAA. Formation lead will take all practical measures to
      avoid entering controlled airspace without clearance. Attempt to avoid leveling at IFR
      altitudes to minimize the possible conflict with IFR traffic.
         18.10.4.4.1. Inadvertent weather penetration with SKE. Immediately upon
         penetrating the weather, formation lead will announce, ―XXXX flight, execute
         inadvertent weather penetration with SKE now, base altitude XXXX, base heading
         XXXX, base airspeed XXXX. Acknowledge.‖ The formation then climbs to a base
         altitude at or above the ESA for the route. Climb at cruise speed and 1,000 feet per
         minute. After the element wingmen establish a 1,000 feet per minute climb, set AFCS
         mode select to SKE, set cross-track to 1,000 feet left or right as appropriate while
         maintaining current separation. When level at the base altitude, lead will announce
         ―assume SKE interval now.‖ At this command, followers will reduce airspeed 20
         knots and drift back to establish appropriate SKE in-trail intervals. Once at
         appropriate SKE in-trail intervals, followers will reset the appropriate cross-track
         distance. If visual conditions cannot be promptly reestablished, lead will contact ATC
         for IFR clearance; declare an emergency if necessary. NOTE: This procedure will
         only be used if SKE was tested, all formation aircraft have SKE in XMIT, SKE is
         operable, and no SKE cautions and warnings.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                   217


          18.10.4.4.2. Inadvertent weather penetration without SKE. Immediately upon
          penetrating the weather, formation lead will announce, ―XXXX flight, execute
          inadvertent weather penetration without SKE now, base altitude XXXX, base heading
          XXXX, base airspeed XXXX. Acknowledge.‖ The formation climbs to a base
          altitude at or above the ESA for the route. Climb at cruise speed and 1,000 feet per
          minute. After the element wingmen establish a 1,000 feet per minute climb, #2 will
          turn right using 30 degrees of bank to a heading 30 degrees from the base heading, #3
          will turn left using 30 degrees of bank to a heading 30 degrees from the base heading.
          They will maintain these divergent headings (once rolled out) for 30 seconds before
          resuming base heading. The use of air-to-air TACAN, TCAS, or radar skin paint
          may aid in maintaining separation from other members of the formation. The last
          element in the formation will occupy the base altitude. All other elements will stack
          1000 feet higher than the following element, with the first element occupying the
          highest altitude. Do not change base heading while in IMC unless required for terrain
          clearance or to avoid controlled airspace. If visual conditions cannot be promptly
          reestablished, lead will contact ATC for IFR clearance; declare an emergency if
          necessary.
   18.10.5. Recovery. If aircraft weights differ significantly, the heaviest aircraft will dictate
   the speeds flown. Aircraft will not descend below preceding aircraft during the recovery.
   18.10.6. Formation Landings. All aircraft land on runway centerline with the same flap
   detent setting. EXCEPTION \: Last aircraft in formation may use a higher flap setting.
   Continue to runway exit point without stopping in any position that would prevent
   succeeding aircraft from clearing the runway. The minimum landing interval is 45 seconds
   (60 seconds desired). Extend the interval as necessary for icy runway conditions,
   short/narrow runways, or other adverse conditions.
       18.10.6.1. Aircraft will not perform touch and go landings out of formation recoveries.
       18.10.6.2. Aircraft may perform GOATs for training provided it is pre-briefed, will not
       negatively affect the formation recovery, and all preceding formation aircraft are clear of
       the runway.
   18.10.7. Lead Changes. To accomplish a visual lead change, the leader will signal or
   command the lead change (if it does not occur at a briefed point) and should give base
   heading. The aborting leader will maneuver in the safest direction to assume the new
   position.
18.11. SKE Procedures. NOTE: When in actual IMC, aircrews should use an alternate
method of identifying other aircraft in the formation (i.e., A/A TACAN, TCAS, and radar skin
paint) in case of a SKE malfunction.
   18.11.1. Due to limitations of the SKE (w/o FFS) system, all formation aircraft should be
   within 9.67 NM of the master for the SKE to function properly and be within 4 NM of the
   selected leader for the flight director to function properly. NOTE: C-17 slots consist of two
   C-130 slot numbers. Mixed C-17/C-130 formations will require slot number selections IAW
   TO 1C-17A-1-2 slot pairings.
218                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


  18.11.2. Prior to each formation turn, appropriate FCI messages will be transmitted by
  element leaders. If element leaders turn without passing FCI data, followers will still receive
  flight director turn guidance; however, accuracy and performance will not be as precise.
  18.11.3. SKE/TCAS Overlay
      18.11.3.1. Upon annunciation of a proximity warning in IMC or VMC conditions,
      wingmen will immediately maneuver the aircraft in a safe direction away from the
      formation. NOTE: Maintaining situational awareness is paramount while operating in
      IMC. Dependent on phase of flight, the safest direction may be in the vertical and/or
      horizontal plane.
      18.11.3.2. During flight in IMC, lead and element leads will announce all preparatory
      and execution speed changes during critical phases of flight including rejoins, airdrop
      slowdowns, and escapes via interplane in conjunction with applicable FCI‘s. Wingmen
      will verbally acknowledge all preparatory speed change announcements from their
      respective leader.
      18.11.3.3. Formations will ensure an extra airdrop qualified pilot is positioned on each
      aircraft to monitor the SKE-PPI page for range divergences while in IMC during critical
      phases of flight. The extra pilot will not have any additional duties (i.e. PADS operator)
      precluding them from monitoring the SKE-PPI page. Without the extra airdrop qualified
      pilot, the formation is limited to no less than 12,000‘ spacing between aircraft while in
      IMC.
      18.11.3.4. SKE/TCAS formations are limited to a maximum of 3 aircraft in IMC.
      18.11.3.5. In VMC conditions, up to 6 SKE TCAS overlay aircraft may fly in formation.
      EXCEPTION: MAJCOM approved formations, or up to 15 SKE TCAS overlay aircraft
      in the vicinity of Pope AFB, NC due to FAA agreement.
  18.11.4. SKE FFS. Not Used
  18.11.5. Flight Command Indicators (FCI). Priority of signals is altitude, heading, and
  airspeed.
  18.11.6. Departure and Assembly. After takeoff each aircraft will fly an independent
  departure, (i.e. climb out instructions or SID), while maintaining formation integrity using
  the PPI until all aircraft attain formation position or the departure is accomplished, whichever
  occurs first. At this point, begin SKE formation turns.
  18.11.7. En Route Procedures. Wingmen maintain position with SKE selected for thrust and
  roll flight director guidance. Wingmen will periodically crosscheck deviation indicators and
  the PPI SKE format. The primary altitude reference will be the aircraft barometric altimeter.
      18.11.7.1. Climb and Descent. Use the vertical deviation indicator (VDI) to monitor the
      selected leader‘s altitude during climb or descent. Followers will report significant
      altitude deviations to lead. CAUTION: SKE (w/o FFS) in-track indicates slant-range
      distance (i.e., if 4000 feet directly above the leader, the in-track will indicate 4000 feet in-
      track.
      18.11.7.2. Airspeed Changes. Lead will signal/announce all changes of 10 knots or
      greater from the established base airspeed.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                 219


     18.11.7.3. Domestic Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (DRVSM).                   RVSM
     separation standards may be applied to formation flights consisting of all RVSM-
     compliant aircraft operating in DRVSM airspace. NOTE: DRVSM airspace includes the
     airspace of the lower 48 states of the United States, Alaska, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico
     high offshore airspace, and the San Juan FIR between flight level (FL) 290-410
     (inclusive).
        18.11.7.3.1. RVSM formation flights may file for a single altitude if all formation
        aircraft fly the assigned altitude, either offset laterally from each other or in trail.
        18.11.7.3.2. RVSM formation flights requiring multiple altitudes should request an
        altitude block. Air traffic control may then apply RVSM separation standards
        between this altitude block and other RVSM aircraft (e.g. an RVSM formation flight
        is assigned flight level (FL) 320-330; ATC assigns other RVSM aircraft at FL310 and
        FL340).
        18.11.7.3.3. RVSM formation aircraft must use their automatic altitude control
        system to maintain the assigned altitude. Aircraft maneuvering within an altitude
        block must ensure they do not exceed the vertical boundaries of the block by utilizing
        the aircraft altitude alerting system, altitude capture function (if installed) and
        automatic altitude control system. If unable to maintain autopilot in vertical axis
        notify ATC of non-compliance with RVSM.
        18.11.7.3.4. Formation flights which do not consist of all RVSM aircraft will
        continue to be considered non-RVSM compliant and will have 2,000-ft vertical
        separation standards applied in DRVSM airspace. In addition, aircraft formations
        conducting aerial refueling will continue to be considered non-RVSM compliant;
        regardless of the participating aircraft's single-ship status.
  18.11.8. En Route Spacing.
     18.11.8.1. Wingman. The second and third aircraft of each element maintain a minimum
     of 4,000 and 8,000 feet spacing, respectively, from their element lead. Maintain spacing
     with reference to the element lead to reduce telescoping effects. The minimum offset
     distance is 500 feet right for the number 2 aircraft, and 500 feet left for the number 3
     aircraft.

       18.11.8.2. Element lead. Each element lead maintains a minimum of 12,000 feet
       separation from the preceding element lead, stacks up 100 ft, and maintains "00" cross-
       track separation.
       18.11.8.3. Long Missions. During long missions, mission commanders may extend en
       route spacing and/or cross track to reduce fatigue, as required.
       18.11.8.4. Position errors. Formation aircraft detecting a significant position error will
       immediately notify the offending aircraft to determine if the error is known. The subject
       aircraft will immediately confirm or establish position by other available means.
   18.11.9. Loss of SKE.
       18.11.9.1. Single aircraft. Any aircraft that loses SKE will notify lead immediately. If
       IMC, establish a safe heading away from the formation. If last aircraft in the formation
       loses SKE, an airspeed reduction may be used to obtain immediate separation. Lead will
       coordinate a separate IFR clearance for the malfunctioning aircraft as needed.
       18.11.9.2. Entire formation. If the entire formation loses SKE, attempt to correct the
       malfunction by changing the master or accomplishing a frequency change provided an
       alternate means of maintaining formation position is being used (A/A TACAN, weather
       radar skin paint, radar beacon, TCAS). If the entire formation loses SKE and is unable to
       correct the malfunction or transition to a visual formation, execute inadvertent weather
       penetration without SKE procedures.
   18.11.10. Lead Change. The aborting leader commands the lead change and the new leader
   acknowledges receipt of this command. If briefed, the change may be accomplished silently
   at a planned point or time. Do not accomplish lead changes in turns or descents.
       18.11.10.1. In IMC, the aborting leader turns 30 degrees away from base heading in the
       safest and most logical direction until at least 1 NM from the formation. Reset
       appropriate crosstrack, range, and leader number. Drift back to rejoin at the end of the
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                 221


     formation. If VMC, the aborting leader may join at a coordinated position within the
     formation.
     18.11.10.2. The follower aircraft will select the new lead and reset crosstrack and range
     as required.
     18.11.10.3. New leader will complete an FCI check (unless already accomplished).
  18.11.11. Recoveries. If recovering a large SKE formation and the planned approach is not
  a straight-in, obtain a minimum of five minutes separation between sections of six or less
  aircraft prior to reaching the recovery base. Ensure the airspace will be available for each
  section of six or less to hold upon arrival at the recovery base if immediate landing is not
  possible. The aircraft acting as master (w/o FFS) for the formation will not turn the
  SKE/master off until all aircraft in the formation have landed. If aircraft weights differ
  significantly, the heaviest aircraft will dictate the speeds flown. The formation may proceed
  visually to the field for a visual recovery, maintain SKE spacing and assume SKE in-line
  formation procedures, fly ATC locally approved SKE approach, or break up for individual
  approaches.
     18.11.11.1. Instrument approaches.
         18.11.11.1.1. Do not fly 45/180 ground tracks.
         18.11.11.1.2. Holding Pattern, Holding Pattern in Lieu of Procedure Turn, or
         Procedure Turn pattern entry will be within 70 degrees of the published inbound
         course on the non-maneuvering side or within 20 degrees on the maneuvering side
         and a minimum of 1,000 feet above procedure turn or GCA pickup altitude. Do not
         enter from the quadrant requiring a turn to the non-maneuvering side.
             18.11.11.1.2.1. Request 2-minute holding legs with more than 3 aircraft in
             formation. CAUTION: In a non-radar environment or uncontrolled airspace,
             lead should consider increasing the formation's minimum altitude to ensure
             terrain/obstacle avoidance.
         18.11.11.1.3. Lead signals the turn outbound over the IAF with the FCI at station
         passage. All follower aircraft delay the turn outbound based on SKE timing, maintain
         formation interval, and complete the approach in accordance with AFMAN 11-
         217V1. Formation lead will ensure all aircraft will stay in the ―remain within‖
         distance for the approach or coordinate with ATC for additional airspace.
  18.11.12. Landing. Minimum landing interval is 10,000 feet (12,000 feet desired).
  18.11.13. Missed Approach. Aircraft executing a missed approach fly the published or
  directed procedure. If weather at the airfield is reported below minimums after the approach
  is started, the formation executes a missed approach, maintaining 160 KCAS (or minimum
  flap retract, whichever is higher) and approach separation. Formation lead requests
  individual approaches, if possible. Coordinate for holding if required. In a radar
  environment, give the controlling agency the order in which aircraft are to depart the flight.
  If individual approaches cannot be obtained or approach control is not available, the
  formation will proceed to an alternate airfield. NOTE: Use caution as loss of SKE may
  occur when the master departs the formation.

18.12. Formation Air Refueling Procedures. The procedures contained in this section cover
only the most common receiver/tanker formations and do not cover all possible situations. The
procedures contained in this section do not relieve the mission commander and section leader of
the responsibility to thoroughly plan and brief these procedures and cover all possible
combinations. All AAR operations will be accomplished IAW T.O. 1-C-17A-1 Chp 8 and ATP
56(B). NOTE: The lead tanker is responsible for navigation of the entire formation (both tanker
and receiver aircraft) from rendezvous through the end of air refueling operations.
   18.12.1. Briefing. The lead receiver aircraft commander briefs all aircraft commanders
   within the receiver cell. This briefing will be in sufficient detail to cover all phases of cell
   operations.
   18.12.2. Aircraft will have operable SKE for formation air refueling flights. If WX radar is
   inoperative, TCAS must be operational. The mission commander will decide based on
   operational necessity the need to continue formation AAR with inoperable SKE or WX radar.
   18.12.3. During refueling, receivers will address themselves as ―Receiver 1‖ (R1), ―Receiver
   2‖ (R2), and ―Receiver 3‖ (R3). Address the individual tankers as ―Tanker 1‖ (T1), ―Tanker
   2‖ (T2), etc.
   18.12.4. Rendezvous Procedures: R1 will keep heading and airspeed changes to a minimum
   during transitions to or from AR echelon.
   18.12.5. Refueling Operations: SKE will be left on throughout refueling.
   18.12.6. Emergency Actions: Upon losing all contact with the tanker lead or the respective
   tanker, or if unable to maintain formation due to disorientation, the wingman will
   simultaneously execute the applicable lost wingman procedure while transitioning to
   instruments.
          18.12.6.1.1. Loss of VMC after rendezvous. In the event any aircraft momentarily
          and inadvertently enters into IMC, loses sight of other receivers or their respective
          tanker in the formation, the affected receiver will inform T1 immediately. If
          continuous radar skin paint off of the respective tanker and SKE position off of all
          other receivers can be maintained, all aircraft will maintain their current position
          (awaiting AR, astern, post AR, etc.) until the formation reenters VMC. If visual
          conditions do not return sufficiently to safely complete the formation AR procedures,
          T1, in coordination with the R1, will take action to ensure both altitude and lateral
          separation from all receivers and tankers. Subsequent receiver rendezvous may be
          coordinated with ATC after obtaining proper separation from the tanker formation
          (i.e. minimum of 2 NM and 1000 feet between the lowest tanker and highest
          receiver).
          18.12.6.1.2. Loss of SKE or WX radar in IMC. The loss of SKE or radar in IMC
          conditions after beginning the transition to AR echelon until completion of formation
          AR procedures will require immediate action by R1 and T1. R1, with the approval of
          T1, will direct the appropriate action for the affected receiver to ensure both lateral
          and vertical separation from all other receivers and tankers.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  223


        18.12.6.1.3. All other receiver aircraft with station keeping ability will maintain their
        current position (awaiting AR, post AR, etc.) until reentering VMC and subsequently
        cleared by R1 and T1.
     18.12.6.2. Lost Wingman Procedures During Receiver AR. Immediately contact T1 and
     establish visual, A/A TACAN, radar, SKE, or radio contact with any co-altitude aircraft.
     If visual, A/A TACAN, radar, SKE, or radio contact cannot be established or maintained,
     descend to an altitude that will provide positive separation from other aircraft and
     decrease airspeed to ensure separation.

                                          Chapter 19

                                          AIRDROP

19.1. General. This chapter prescribes C-17 employment procedures for all airdrop operations.
For additional guidance and information, refer to T.O. 1C-17A-1-4 and AFTTP 3-3.C-17. NAS
training operations are required to comply with FAR 105 restrictions.
19.2. Radio Discipline. Unless used in conjunction with airdrop execution, avoid use of the
words GREEN/NO DROP after the Slowdown Checklist and until completion of the Post Drop
checklist. "GREEN LIGHT" will be seen or heard by the loadmaster for all drops.
19.3. NVG Airdrop. Airdrops may be accomplished on drop zones lit IAW AFI 13-217
lighting patterns (covert and overt) while wearing NVGs, to include unmarked drop zones.
   19.3.1. Pilots are authorized to perform all airdrop methods while utilizing NVGs.
   19.3.2. Loadmasters are authorized to perform all equipment type airdrops while utilizing
   NVGs. Loadmasters are prohibited from conducting personnel airdrop operations while
   utilizing NVGs.
   19.3.3. Cargo compartment lighting will be set to the lowest possible setting to accomplish
   the mission. Blacked out (no-light) operations in the cargo compartment are not authorized.
19.4. Airdrop Equipment.
   19.4.1. Airdrop Rigging Material. The loadmaster is responsible to obtain a sufficient
   amount of rigging material to satisfy load or mission requirements. These items include, but
   are not limited to: cloth-backed pressure sensitive tape, 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord, type III
   nylon cord, # 5 cord, and 1/4 inch cotton webbing.
19.5. Safety Equipment.
   19.5.1. Personnel performing duties required to be mobile in the cargo compartment during
   air-drop, low level operations, or threat environments will wear protective headgear (except
   personnel performing water jumps). All other personnel in the cargo compartment will be
   seated with seat belts fastened. Loadmasters will lower their helmet visor before opening the
   troop doors and keep them lowered until the troop doors are closed. EXCEPTION: Helmet
   visor is not required while wearing NVG‘s.
   19.5.2. All occupants of the cargo compartment will either wear a parachute or an attached
   restraint harness, or be seated with a seat belt fastened before a troop door and/or the cargo
   door and ramp is opened. When a troop door(s) or the cargo door/ramp is open and the
   aircraft is below 800 feet AGL or above 25,000 feet MSL, occupant(s) will wear a restraint
   harness. For operations over water, when parachute(s) are required, LPU(s) will be worn.
   EXCEPTION: For static line jumps, static lines are attached to anchor cables before troop
   door(s) are opened. Jumpers exiting on subsequent passes may stand and hook up with
   door(s) opened if they are forward of FS 1027.
       19.5.2.1. The restraint harness will be adjusted to allow mobility to perform duties but
       not to a length that would allow the wearer to fall out of the aircraft. The restraint
       harness will be fitted and adjusted prior to flight. The lifeline is 18 feet 6 inches long.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                    225


      With the cargo ramp and door open the restraint harness may be connected to any tie
      down ring at or forward of FS 1188. With the paratroop doors open the restraint harness
      may be connected to any tie down ring. EXCEPTION: Loadmasters requiring mobility
      in the cargo compartment while using a restraint harness can be unattached as long as
      they remain forward of FS 1188 with the cargo door and ramp open or FS 1027 with the
      paratroop door(s) open. WARNING: Except for an actual contingency, towed trooper,
      or emergency that threatens the survivability of the aircraft and crew, the restraint harness
      will not be disconnected or lengthened to a point that would allow the loadmaster to fall
      outside the aircraft.
      19.5.2.2. Aircrew Flight Equipment on Personnel Airdrops. EPOS and Life Preservers
      not properly secured in storage pouch will be stowed immediately prior to the airdrop.
      Life preservers may be stowed earlier on non over water flights.
          19.5.2.2.1. Three additional parachutes, not including those required for aircrew, will
          be aboard the aircraft for training missions performing personnel airdrops. Two will
          be available for Army safety personnel use. User safety personnel will provide their
          own parachutes for contingency missions.
19.6. Airdrop Load Information.
   19.6.1. The loadmaster will complete the Joint Airdrop Inspection Records (applicable DD
   Form 1748) before takeoff and verify the accuracy of cargo and troop documentation (see
   AFI 11-231, Computed Air Release Point Procedures, and AFJI 13-210, for specifics). The
   loadmaster will reject loads with inaccurate or unavailable weights, or loads hazardous to
   flight. If in-flight rigging is required, the loadmaster will use the applicable DD Form 1748
   as a checklist to ensure all items are completed. NOTE: Equipment not rigged IAW 13C-
   series TOs or Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) 350 series manuals, requires a
   waiver from MAJCOM tactics. NOTE: Rigging for Dual Row 463L training pallets will be
   IAW the approved AMC interim rigging guide. Only AF aerial delivery units are authorized
   to rig using this guide. This will be an interim guide until appropriate rigging FM/TOs are
   released.
      19.6.1.1. A separate AF Form 1748 is required for each heavy equipment/dual row
      platform or CDS gate used.
      19.6.1.2. Planners and aircrew will verify chute types planned with the user during
      mission planning. Aircrews will be made aware of chute types on planning documents.
      At a minimum, chute type and planned drop altitude will be annotated on the Mission
      Data Card.
      19.6.1.3. Joint Airdrop Inspectors (JAIs) will annotate actual chute type in the remarks
      section of the AF Form 1748.
      19.6.1.4. During execution, aircrews will verify actual chute type loaded on the aircraft
      by referencing the remarks section on the AF Form 1748. Crews will verify the correct
      drop altitude, chute type and number are entered in the MC.
   19.6.2. Load verification and marking. A pilot will verify with the loadmaster that the actual
   number and type of parachutes, load weights, sequence of extraction, and position of loads in
   the aircraft agree with entered mission computer data. For training missions (e.g. unilateral,
 226                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   exercise, or JA/ATT) the pilots will ensure all equipment, drogues, CDS containers, and
   standard airdrop training bundles are marked with, at a minimum, the aircraft call sign and
   date. If more than one load is dropped on the same pass, mark loads with order of exit from
   aircraft. Markings will be placed on the load, extraction chute line, and drogue line.
   EXCEPTION: If more than one CDS bundle is dropped on the same pass, mark only the
   first container out.
   19.6.3. Combination Airdrops. Any combination of Heavy Equipment, Dual Row or CDS
   airdrops will not be conducted on the same aircraft sortie. Airdrops on subsequent sorties,
   that utilize a different aerial delivery method than the previous sortie, may be conducted
   provided a Joint Airdrop Inspection (JAI) is completed prior to takeoff for the subsequent
   sortie. Personnel airdrops may be accomplished in association with any type airdrop.
   19.6.4. If airdrop loads and airland cargo are carried at the same time, refer to the restrictions
   listed in Table 19.1 These restrictions are designed to prevent airland loads from interfering
   with airdrop rigging equipment.

       19.6.5.16. Black and white stripes - mail.
19.7. Required Figures of Merit (FOM)/Required Navigation Performance (RNP).
   19.7.1. IMC Airdrop.
       19.7.1.1. W/o RNP. Lead requires a MC FOM of 3 or less to descend from minimum
       IFR en route altitude to IMC drop altitude. IMC airdrop requires a MC FOM of 3 or less
       to drop using MC guidance. For SKE airdrops, wingmen may descend to IMC drop
       altitude and drop off the SKE timer regardless of MC FOM.
 228                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


       19.7.1.2. RNP. Lead requires no UNABLE RNP message to descend from minimum IFR
       en route altitudes to IMC drop altitude. IMC airdrop requires no UNABLE RNP message
       when using MC guidance. For SKE airdrops, wingmen may descend to IMC drop altitude
       and drop off the SKE timer regardless of MC ANP status.
   19.7.2. JPADS/ICDS.
       19.7.2.1. W/o RNP. Aircraft require a MC FOM of 3 or less to drop.
       19.7.2.2. RNP. Aircraft cannot drop with an UNABLE RNP message.
19.8. Notice To Airmen (NOTAM) Requirements.
   19.8.1. Airdrop Notice to Airmen. For IFR airdrop in uncontrolled airspace a Letter of
   Agreement between local ATC and the military is required. Also, provide a NOTAM to the
   FAA Flight Service Station nearest the objective area at least 6 hours in advance of the
   intended activity, regardless of actual or forecast weather. NOTAM information will
   include:
       19.8.1.1. The name of the city or town nearest the route segment and the state.
       19.8.1.2. The date and time period of planned activity.
       19.8.1.3. The number and type of aircraft expected on the route.
       19.8.1.4. The ingress and egress points of the route segment expressed in
       fix/radial/distance from a very high frequency omnidirectional range.
       19.8.1.5. The altitude at which the aircraft will be flown.
19.9. Minimum Drop Altitudes.
   19.9.1. Day VMC is the minimum drop altitude as specified in AFI 11-231 but no lower than
   300 feet AGL.
       19.9.1.1. During training, flight below 500 feet AGL is only authorized on approved
       routes per para. 16.5.7.2.
   19.9.2. Night VMC is an indicated altitude of 500 feet above the highest obstruction to
   flight, or 400 feet plus one chart contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour,
   whichever is higher, within 3 NM of run-in centerline from IP thru ESC.
       19.9.2.1. Altitudes on DZ run-in may be segmented to allow descent to minimum drop
       altitude as specified in AFI 11-231, but no lower than 500 feet AGL. Once the limiting
       obstruction is visually identified and the aircraft can maintain well clear, laterally and/or
       longitudinally, the crew may descend to the next segment altitude. Consider the
       complexity introduced if the obstruction is not identified, and the altitude for which the
       drop is computed cannot be reached.
   19.9.3. NVG is an indicated altitude of 500 feet above the highest spot terrain elevation, or
   400 feet plus one chart contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever
   is higher, within 3 NM of run-in centerline from IP thru ESC.
       19.9.3.1. Altitudes on DZ run-in may be segmented to allow descent to minimum drop
       altitude as specified in AFI 11-231, but no lower than 500 feet AGL. Once the limiting
       obstruction is visually identified and the aircraft is can maintain well clear, laterally

      and/or longitudinally, the crew may descend to the next segment altitude. Consider the
      complexity introduced if the obstruction is not identified, and the altitude for which the
      drop is computed cannot be reached.
      19.9.3.2. NLT 3 NM prior to any charted man-made obstacle within the run-in corridor,
      the aircrew must visually identify the obstacle. If the obstacle is not identified by 3NM,
      climb to 500 feet above the obstacle until the aircrew confirms the aircraft is past the
      obstacle.
   19.9.4. IMC drop altitude is 500 feet above the highest obstruction to flight, or 400 feet plus
   one chart contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is higher,
   within 3 NM of run-in centerline from DZ entry point to DZ exit point. WARNING: Drop
   zone surveys do not assure terrain and obstruction clearance. The responsibility is incumbent
   upon planners and aircrew through thorough mission planning and chart updating. NOTE:
   AFI 11-231 minimum chute altitudes may require the aircraft to drop at a higher altitude than
   those listed above.

   19.10.1. IFR Drop Corridor. The IFR Drop Corridor is the corridor where aircraft may
   operate below IFR en route altitude. The beginning of the corridor, the IFR Drop Corridor
   Ingress Point, is a maximum of 40 miles from the IFR Drop Corridor Egress Point (co-
   located with the DZ Exit Point). Plan segmented corridor altitudes not lower than 500 feet

  above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot elevation),
  or 400 feet plus one contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is
  higher, within 3 nautical miles of centerline.
      19.10.1.1. Drops conducted through or originating from IMC are only authorized from
      within or above an active restricted area or military operations in uncontrolled airspace.
      19.10.1.2. In addition to required RNP/FOM, do not initiate descent from the minimum
      IFR en route altitude to IMC drop altitude unless all aircraft in the element are inside the
      DZ entry point, on course, with element lead‘s position positively known. NOTE: The
      40NM IFR Drop Corridor is an agreement with the FAA in designated FAA airspace.
      When conducting IFR airdrops outside FAA airspace, reference these IFR drop corridor
      procedures for planning purposes, however, the 40NM restriction does not apply
  19.10.2. IFR DZ Entry Point. A fixed point in the IFR Drop Corridor where an aircraft or
  formation may safely begin descent from IFR en route altitude or a segmented altitude to
  IMC drop altitude. Formation descent will not begin until the last aircraft is at or past the DZ
  entry point.
  19.10.3. Earliest Descent Point (EDP). Earliest point in the IFR Drop Corridor where the
  formation lead may descend the entire formation to IMC drop altitude and be assured of
  terrain clearance for the entire formation. Computed by subtracting formation length (e.g., a
  4-ship is 2 NMs long) from the computed DZ entry point. A minimum of 6 NM stabilization
  point is recommended in IMC.
  19.10.4. IMC Stabilization Point. The point after the DZ entry point where the lead aircraft
  will plan to be stabilized at IMC drop altitude and airspeed (normally 6NM from the PI).
  19.10.5. Latest Descent Point (LDP). Latest possible point in the IFR corridor where
  formation lead may begin descent to IMC drop altitude and be assured of terrain clearance
  for the entire formation. This is the latest point that ensures all aircraft in the formation are
  stabilized on altitude and airspeed.
  19.10.6. IFR DZ Exit Point. A fixed point on the DZ escape flight path centerline where
  each aircraft will be at minimum IFR en route altitude. Calculate the exit point based upon
  three-engine performance at airdrop gross weight. This point will be a minimum of 4 NMs
  track distance from the trailing edge of the DZ. Also referred to as the IFR Drop Corridor
  Egress point.

19.11. VFR Drop Profile.
   19.11.1. VFR DZ Entry Point. A fixed point in the Drop Corridor where the aircraft or
   formation transitions from VFR en route procedures to VFR airdrop procedures (normally
   the planned slowdown point).
   19.11.2. VFR DZ Exit Point. A fixed point on the DZ escape flight path centerline where
   each aircraft will be at minimum VFR en route altitude. Calculate the exit point based upon
   three-engine performance at airdrop gross weight.
19.12. Dual Row.
   19.12.1. Minimum dual row drop altitude is:
       19.12.1.1. G-11D: 1200 feet AGL
       19.12.1.2. G-12 D/E: 1000 feet AGL
   19.12.2. Formation Dual Row. Formation airdrop of dual row platforms is authorized from
   any position in the element.
       19.12.2.1. Increase minimum drop zone width by 400 yds (200 yds each side) in addition
       to AFI 13-217 minimum drop zone calculations.
   19.12.3. Crews will not use autopilot/autothrottles during the airdrop sequence; the
   autopilot/autothrottles will not maintain correct deck angle.
19.13. High Altitude Airdrop Operations.
   19.13.1. For communications and signals, interphone and hand signals are the primary
   methods of communications. Written messages may be necessary in some instances to
   communicate with individuals not connected to the aircraft interphone. Loadmasters will
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  235


   carry a suitable writing utensil and medium to write out messages that cannot be dealt with
   by using hand signals. When dropping parachutists, the jumpmaster may monitor interphone.
   The loadmaster will coordinate all hand signals with the jumpmaster.
   19.13.2. Crewmembers will wear parachutes or restraint harnesses in the cargo compartment
   any time the doors are open during high altitude airdrop operations. Safety harnesses shall be
   worn on airdrops conducted above 25,000 feet MSL. (LPUs must be worn with parachutes
   for operations over bodies of water with the doors open).
   19.13.3. Maintain interphone contact between the cockpit and the cargo compartment. The
   loadmaster must be on interphone from completion of pre-slowdown checks until execution
   of the completion of drop checklist and the cabin altitude is below 10,000 feet. The
   jumpmaster may also monitor interphone during high altitude personnel airdrops.
19.14. High Altitude Airdrop Oxygen Requirements.
   19.14.1. A continuous supply of 100 percent oxygen will be used by all personnel during
   unpressurized operations above 10,000 feet MSL. Crewmembers will follow established
   MAJCOM oxygen mask requirements.
      19.14.1.1. EXCEPTIONS:
          19.14.1.1.1. Students of the Military Free Fall School, Parachutist Course (MFFPC)
          and Military Free Fall Jumpmaster Course (MFFJM), may perform unpressurized
          operations between the altitudes of 10,000 feet MSL and 13,000 feet MSL without
          supplemental oxygen, for a period not to exceed 2 hours, with the following safety
          measures in place:
          19.14.1.1.2. For MFFPC Students: A suitably qualified USAF Physiology
          Technician (PT) will be onboard and positioned in the aft portion of the cargo
          compartment when aircraft is between 10,000-13,000 feet MSL for longer than 30
          minutes. Unpressurized flights between these altitudes will not exceed 2 hours. The
          USAF PT will remain on 100% oxygen (or an appropriate air mix) throughout the
          unpressurized portion of the flight above 10,000 feet MSL. Under circumstances
          where a USAF PT is unavailable, a US Army 18 Delta Medic or USAF Pararescue
          trained and certified by HQ ACC/SGOP may be used. The role of the PT will be to
          monitor parachutists for signs of impairment resulting from hypoxia. If hypoxic
          impairment is suspected, the parachutist will be returned to the forward portion of the
          cargo compartment and administered 100% oxygen. Once symptoms and signs of
          hypoxia have been resolved, the parachutist may continue training. Instructors and
          jumpmasters will have 100% oxygen available (provided by the user) and will breathe
          from this supply whenever practicable.
          19.14.1.1.3. For MFFJM Students: There is no requirement for a USAF PT to be
          onboard for unpressurized operations between 10,000 and 13,000 feet MSL.
          However, the parachutists will breathe 100% oxygen for a period of at least 3
          minutes, immediately prior to jumping if their time between 10,000 and 13,000 feet
          MSL exceeds 30 minutes. Supplemental oxygen will be supplied by an oxygen
          console provided by the Military Free Fall School.
236                              AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


  19.14.2. All other parachutists may operate without supplemental oxygen during
  unpressurized flights up to 13,000 feet MSL provided the time above 10,000 feet MSL does
  not exceed 30 minutes each sortie. Jumpmasters may operate without supplemental oxygen
  for an additional 60 minutes within the 10,000-13,000 foot MSL envelope provided their
  duties do not include jumping. For unpressurized flight above 13,000 feet MSL, or
  exceeding the 30-minute envelope between 10,000 and 13,000 feet MSL, the use of an
  individual mask and regulator is required for all jumpers. The user is responsible for all
  supplemental oxygen requirements.
  19.14.3. When dropping from 20,000 feet MSL or higher, use pre-breathing procedures.
  When the aircraft oxygen system does not provide sufficient oxygen regulators for all
  personnel, approved portable oxygen console(s) will be pre-flighted and installed in the
  aircraft. The console(s) will provide enough oxygen regulators for all parachutists and
  crewmembers not accommodated by the normal aircraft system.
      19.14.3.1. All airdrops above 25,000 feet MSL require a waiver to AFI 11-202V3 for
      unpressurized flight, from AF Flt Stds Agency (AFFSA) Oklahoma City, OK through
      MAJCOM/Stan/Eval. MA-1 portable oxygen units (with serviceable web carrying straps)
      equipped with A-21 regulators will be provided for each person aboard the aircraft except
      parachutists. WARNING: No personnel will be exposed to unpressurized flight at or
      above 30,000 feet MSL more than three times each 7 days; in addition, they must have a
      minimum of 24 hours between exposures.
  19.14.4. Pre-breathing requirements for Missions at or Above FL 200. All personnel will
  prebreathe 100 percent oxygen below 16,000 feet MSL pressure altitude or cabin altitude on
  any mission scheduled for an exposure at or above FL 200 for times shown in Table 19.6
  Operational considerations dictate that pre-breathing must be completed before the cabin
  altitude exceeds 16,000 feet MSL. The aircraft commander, with recommendations from the
  PT, will determine the course of action for a break in pre-breathing. All personnel on board
  the aircraft will remain on 100 percent oxygen until cabin altitude is below FL 100. Pre-
  breathing will be conducted with a personally-fitted oxygen mask attached to an approved
  helmet and personal oxygen system. NOTE: Portable oxygen bottles may not be used for
  pre-breathing; the quick-don/smoke mask is emergency equipment and is not approved for
  pre-breathing or operations conducted at or above FL 200. The purpose of pre-breathing
  (denitrogenation) is to reduce the amount of nitrogen in the body and therefore reduce the
  risk of altitude-induced decompression sickness (DCS). Pre-breathing times are based on
  scientific research that outlines acceptable DCS risks. Major factors that enhance the
  effectiveness of denitrogenation are good hydration and good circulation.

       to
    FL 349
*NOTE: Maximum exposure time per sortie is when cabin altitude reaches maximum planned
altitude; extended or delayed ascent times expose everyone onboard to greater DCS risk;
missions that require staggered altitude drops will use accumulative times per sortie information
for mission planning. Mission planned drops at FL350, FL299, and FL249; 30 minutes upon
reaching FL350, descend to FL299, spend only 30 minutes (60 accumulative), descend to
FL249, spend only 30 minutes (90 minutes accumulative). No more than 3 Pre-breather sorties
in a 24-hour period unless otherwise restricted.
NOTE: Maximum Exposure Time Per Sortie is considered to be any time cabin altitude exceeds
10,000 feet MSL. Personnel will conduct no more than two oxygen jumps per 24-hour period
that do not require pre-breathing (from 13,000 feet MSL up to FL200) one of which, in the same
24 hour period, that requires pre-breathing (FL200 MSL or above). Example: Scenario 1: 2x
17,500 feet MSL or Scenario 2: 1 x 24,999 feet MSL and 1 x 17,500 feet MSL).

   19.14.5. The jumpmaster may dictate the use of supplemental oxygen by any or all jumpers
   at altitudes less than those listed. Parachutists transfer from the aircraft oxygen system or
   portable oxygen console to a personal oxygen system at approximately one minute before
   green light.
   19.14.6. Pressurization Scheduling. Maintain cabin pressure at or below 10,000 feet until the
   pre-slowdown checklist (time for check may have to be adjusted) and until pre-breathing is
   complete. Depressurization will not exceed 3,000 feet per minute. Slower rates are
   recommended if time allows. Ensure zero pressure differential before opening doors.
19.15. High Altitude Operational Requirements for Physiology Technicians. PTs will
support high altitude airdrop missions IAW AFI 11-409. A minimum of 2 PTs will be on all
airdrops conducted at 20,000 feet MSL or above. When crew and jumper total exceeds 32 an
additional USAF PT is required for each 16 personnel on board the aircraft for all unpressurized
 238                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


high altitude missions conducted at or above 20,000 feet MSL. PT support for high altitude
missions below FL200 is by request to further mitigate risks and is highly recommended. All
CONUS requests for PT support must be made to the USAF HAAMS current operations desk
(DSN 731-7389). PACAF requests must be made to Kadena AB, JA (DSN 315-634-1967).
NOTE: The USAF High Altitude Airdrop Mission Support Program Manager, 203 West Losey
Street, Building 1700, Suite 1600, Scott AFB IL 62225 may authorize variations to the PT-to-
personnel ratio.
19.16. High Altitude Airdrop PT Duties.
   19.16.1. PTs will fly as crewmembers as stated on aeronautical orders. When missions
   require a PT, the PT will be on interphone at all times. PT flight duty stations will be as
   required to monitor crewmembers, jumpers, and oxygen equipment. PTs will:
       19.16.1.1. Preflight aircraft supplemental oxygen equipment.
       19.16.1.2. Advise and aid loadmasters in positioning and securing oxygen equipment.
       19.16.1.3. Brief crew and jumpers prior to the first mission on physiological problems
       that may be encountered, the importance of proper pre-breathing, and any special
       requirements.
       19.16.1.4. Advise the PIC, crew, jumpers, and other personnel on use of oxygen
       equipment and on the depressurization schedule.
       19.16.1.5. Monitor personnel, aircraft and supplemental oxygen equipment, and aircrew
       flight equipment.
19.17. High Altitude Personnel Airdrop Procedures. CAUTION: Ensure any paratroopers
remaining on-board de-arm their parachutes before cabin altitude descends below set parachute
activation altitude.
   19.17.1. Air deflectors must be operational if paratroop doors are used. If an air deflector
   does not extend, do not open the affected troop door.
   19.17.2. The ramp and door or paratroop door may remain open during racetracks if
   required, provided racetrack altitude is at or above a safe drop altitude and paratroopers are
   rigged for high altitude airdrops.
   19.17.3. For jumpmaster-directed HALO drops, the green light may be turned on one minute
   prior to the release point. The pilot will provide a standard "green light" call at the jointly
   agreed upon release point. User assumes responsibility for drop accuracy.
   19.17.4. Normally, the jumpers will exit the aircraft at their own discretion; however, their
   exit must occur during the green light time.
19.18. Personnel Airdrop.
   19.18.1. Drop parameters. Aircraft will no-drop if not within the following tolerances at
   green light.
       19.18.1.1. Element leads must maintain a minimum of 32,000 feet to preceding element
       lead.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                      239


       19.18.1.2. Wingman Spacing Within Elements (For up to 12 Degrees of Drift). The
       second aircraft in each element will be positioned 3,000 feet aft and 650 feet right for a
       right echelon, 650 feet left for a left echelon. The third aircraft in each element will be
       positioned 6,000 feet aft and 1,500 feet right for a right echelon, 1,500 feet left for a left
       echelon. For drifts greater than 12 degrees, use appropriate spacing in Table 19.7. Lead
       will signal the direction of echelon and expected drift prior to the pre-IP. Wingmen will
       reset longtrack on lead's command and automatically echelon in the descent to drop
       altitude (or on lead's command in case of level slowdown or pop-up). Compression to
       3,000-/6,000-foot spacing should be initiated not later than the slowdown point. Element
       wingmen will be established in echelon geometry by 1 minute prior to the drop. All
       elements fly the same drop altitude.

       19.18.1.3. Wingmen restrictions are ±500 feet fore/aft, ±200 feet left/right of position.
       WARNING: If the second aircraft is not within these tolerances, a no drop will be called
       for both Number Two and Number Three aircraft by Number Two. NOTE: To prevent
       course correction at mission computer red light, consider using split axis or heading hold.
19.19. Slowdown Planning. For equipment or CDS AUTO drops, the aircraft should be at drop
altitude and drop airspeed by 10 seconds prior to the computed air release point. During
personnel drops, the aircraft should be at or above drop altitude and stable not later than 1 minute
to go (2 minutes for jumpmaster-directed drops) to allow the jumpmasters access to the paratroop
doors.
19.20. Navigation to the CARP. The primary method for navigating to the CARP is using a
MC-calculated release solution updated with GPS. Alternate methods (using radar beacon (w/o
APS 150), SKE, GRADS, VIRS, pilot-directed visual releases) are available, provided ground
forces are willing to accept less airdrop accuracy.

   19.20.1. The PF is responsible for ensuring the aircraft is positioned at the release point at
   green light and for maintaining drift-corrected track through red light. The PM is responsible
   for ensuring a countdown to green light, the green light call, and the red light calls are given.
   19.20.2. Element Lead. After slowdown, each element lead will fly an independent run-in to
   the CARP.
19.21. GPS Airdrop. A preflight drop box will be computed and updated prior to initiation of
the release point checklist. If the aircrew determines that the aircraft will be outside the drop box
at green light, a no drop will be called.
   19.21.1. During the Slowdown Checklist, the following items must be confirmed if planning
   to drop in IMC:
       19.21.1.1. At least one GPS receiver will be updating with no "RAIM ALERT"
       messages present.
       19.21.1.2. No "DEGRADED NAV ACC" or ―UNABLE RNP‖ messages will be present.
       19.21.1.3. Pilot-Initiated Airdrops. Non SOLL-II crews require MAJCOM/A3/DO
       approval before accomplishing actual pilot directed airdrops or GRADS. EXCEPTION:
       Pilot directed airdrops may be accomplished for training on dry passes only.
   19.21.2. Crews should load GPS crypto for all airdrop operations to enhance GPS accuracy.
19.22. JPADS/ICDS Airdrop.
   19.22.1. JPADS certified POs are authorized to use the JPADS mission planner and software
   to calculate release points for JPADS/I-CDS airdrop operations
   19.22.2. The PO or mission planner is required to provide JPADS-MP derived CARP(S) for
   each airdrop pass and a completed Collateral Damage Assessment (CDA) prior to an airdrop
   mission. Both pilots will review preflight CARP(S)/CDA for each respective airdrop.
   19.22.3. Collateral Damage Assessment (CDA). Units must perform a full CDA prior to
   JPADS/ I-CDS airdrops. The CDA must be coordinated and approved by the area controlling
   agency. Coordinate with the owning agency of the restricted airspace or controlled airspace
   and landowners with property surrounding the DZ for all JPADS/I-CDS operations. Examine
   the area in the vicinity of the DZ for potential damage or hazards in the course of normal
   operations or during extraordinary system failure events. If the CDA demonstrates potential
   damage or hazards restrict airdrop release launch acceptability region (LAR), lower the drop
   altitude, change the run-in, change parachute type or cancel operations. Inform the
   controlling unit of the risk to their operations; the controlling unit, and the Joint Force
   Controller (JFC) designated agency are approving authorities for risk to the area surrounding
   the DZ. Intelligence personnel are responsible for providing the JFC-designated agency
   close-up and overview imagery to facilitate CDA. See AFI 13-217 for further information.
   The CDA must include, at a minimum, a review of the airspace and ground space with
   respect to:
       19.22.3.1. CARP and LAR location.
       19.22.3.2. 63% 1-sigma I-CDS success ellipse.
       19.22.3.3. Chute failure footprint.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  241


     19.22.3.4. Guidance failure footprint.
  19.22.4. IMC/VMC day/night airdrops are authorized for contingency operations. CONUS
  training operations are required to comply with FAR 105 restrictions.
     19.22.4.1. Drops conducted through or originating from IMC are only authorized from
     within or above an active restricted area or military operations in uncontrolled airspace.
     19.22.4.2. JPADS parachutes will not be dropped through severe turbulence or severe
     icing.
  19.22.5. Wind Limits. Wind limitations are unrestricted for dropsonde operations, 18 knots
  for Firefly, Screamer, and Dragonfly, and as published in AFI 13-217 for all other
  parachutes.
  19.22.6. Drop zone Size. Drop zone size criteria for JPADS and I-CDS drops during
  contingency operations is at the discretion of the user. AFI 13-217 drop zone size restrictions
  apply during training.
  19.22.7. JPADS Guided and Dropsonde Footprint Locations. During normal training
  operations, a JPADS and Dropsonde DZ, CARP, chute failure footprint and guidance failure
  footprint will be located within a restricted airspace. If winds force the CARP outside of
  restricted airspace additional coordination with ATC is required prior to airdrop operations.
  This includes coordination with the ATC agency, filing a Notices to Airmen (NOTAM), and
  ensuring airspace is clear for the entire guided system‗s flight profile from the drop altitude
  to the ground.
  19.22.8. During training operations, the entire 1-sigma (63%) I-CDS success footprint will
  be located within the surveyed DZ boundaries. The chute failure footprint must fall within:
     19.22.8.1. Restricted airspace if conducting operations in a restricted airspace
     19.22.8.2. The surveyed DZ, if not conducting operations in a restricted airspace.
  19.22.9. Jettison of JPADS AGU with Military GPS (MILGPS). Instances of jettison,
  unauthorized access, tampering, theft, or loss of the JPADS MILGPS enclosure must be
  reported to the GPS Controlling Authority (CA). Each such report shall include the JPADS
  MILGPS serial number and Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) GPS
  serial number of the missing item and must state whether the system was keyed or unkeyed.
  Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS) will relay such jettison to the GPS
  CA. NOTE: Time permitting; the LM with concurrence from the PO will remove the
  MILGPS enclosure from the AGU prior to load jettison.
  19.22.10. JPADS AGU MILGPS Procedure. For training missions with Air Force JPADS
  AGUs, aircrews will check out the MILGPS from the unit tactics office. Upon mission
  completion and prior to removing the MILGPS enclosure, power up the AGU and
  accomplish the Recovery Mission Duration Zeroization function (if desired). Zeroize prior to
  removal by pushing, for three seconds, the zeroize button located on the front panel of the
  MILGPS enclosure. NOTE: Keying and unkeying requires the MILGPS to be installed in
  a powered ON AGU. The AGU LCD screen should update within 20 seconds and should
  read MILGPS Keyed or Unkeyed. Once complete power OFF the AGU. The PO will remove
  and return the enclosure to the Unit‗s Tactics Office.

                              AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION

20.1. Mission.
   20.1.1. This chapter applies to Air Force C-17 Aircrews, AE Aircrews and all management
   levels concerned with operations of the C-17 aircraft. All operators involved in AE missions
   on C-17 aircraft will use this AFI.
   20.1.2. C-17 aircraft may be used for AE transport of ill or injured DOD members and their
   dependents. These AE missions may be directed at any time by C2 agencies. AE personnel
   will utilize the procedures in applicable AFI 11-2AE-V3 series and 41-307, in conjunction
   with this publication, to accomplish the AE mission.
20.2. Operational Control and Reporting of Aeromedical Evacuation Forces.
   20.2.1. HQ AMC is lead command for AE. HQ AMC Directorate of Operations (AMC/A3)
   is the executive agent for operational AE missions.
   20.2.2. Command and control of AE missions is the same as other airlift missions.
   20.2.3. The PIC is a qualified pilot responsible for command and control of all persons
   aboard the aircraft during an AE mission. In matters of flight safety, crew duty waivers, or
   operational considerations, his/her decisions are final. In matters of patient care, decisions of
   the Medical Crew Director (MCD) are final.
   20.2.4. Medical Crew Director. The MCD is a qualified flight nurse responsible for the
   overall supervision of patient care and management of AECMs assigned to AE missions.
   He/she advises the PIC on patients‘ conditions and the use of medical equipment that may
   affect aircraft operations. The MCD is directly responsible for the safety and medical well-
   being of patients on the aircraft and coordinates enplaning and deplaning procedures with
   supporting agencies. In matters of patient care, the decisions of the MCD are final.
20.3. Alerting Procedures.
   20.3.1. At all locations AMC C2 agency will alert the PIC/MCD. The MCD will alert the
   medical crew. The goal is to link the primary PIC, local AMC C2 agency and MCD before
   mission execution.
   20.3.2. When the AE crew is staged separate from the front-end crew, the MCD will contact
   AMC local C2 agency and establish alert, showtime, etc. with the C2 agency. The MCD will
   make every effort to communicate with the front-end crew any mission irregularities prior to
   crew rest. Utilize local AMC C2 agency to leave messages for non-emergency. Crew rest
   will be based on scheduled launch time. Do not violate crew rest.
   20.3.3. The local AMC C2 agency will provide PIC/MCD AE mission information when
   he/she checks on mission status. Local C2 agency will be the link between the AE crews and
   the PIC, thus permitting mission status updates to both parties without interruption of crew
   rest.
   20.3.4. AE mission requirements can change depending on clinical status of patient(s) and
   aircraft availability. There will be occasions when aircraft cannot depart (i.e. MX problems)
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                     243


   or emergency patient movement that may separate an AE crew from the front-end crew. The
   MCD is responsible for communicating these changes with the PIC and local AMC C2
   agency to de-conflict problems.
20.4. Pilot in Command Responsibilities.
   20.4.1. Establish communications link with the MCD during pre-mission planning and
   throughout the mission.

   20.6.2. Assist loadmaster/maintenance crew with aircraft configuration for AE operations.
   20.6.3. Install and remove medical equipment/supplies.
   20.6.4. The MCD or designated AECM should monitor interphone (headset) during flight.
   The MCD will be on headset with the PIC during critical phases of flight and during in-flight
   emergencies.
   20.6.5. The CMT is responsible for all ground operations involved with patients. The CMT,
   in coordination with the loadmaster, is responsible for vehicle movement/positioning around
   the aircraft.
20.7. Ground Operations.
   20.7.1. Engines should be shut down during enplaning and deplaning of patients.
   EXCEPTION: ERO procedures as outlined in 20.14.
20.8. Aircraft Refueling.
   20.8.1. Refueling normally begins after deplaning patients are off the aircraft and prior to
   enplaning that station's patients.
       20.8.1.1. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
   20.8.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. Concurrent servicing (CS) is the simultaneous
   servicing of fuel or oxygen with or without patients on board while cargo loading/unloading
   or maintenance operations are being performed.
       20.8.2.1. The PIC and Chief Servicing Supervisor (CSS) shall ensure aircrew members
       and servicing personnel accomplish Concurrent Servicing (CS) per AFI 32-2001 The Fire
       Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program and TO 00-25-172. The CSS will
       coordinate with all personnel involved prior to beginning concurrent operations.
       20.8.2.2. Prior to starting concurrent servicing, the total number of patients, passengers,
       and crew on board the aircraft will be given to the fire department.
       20.8.2.3. A current and qualified crewmember for the type of aircraft being serviced will
       be appointed as a Passenger Compartment Monitor (PCM) and shall continuously
       monitor patients/passengers during CS. PCMs will not perform other duties during
       servicing. EXCEPTION: see MDS guidance below. AECMs and passenger service
       representatives will not serve as PCMs.
       20.8.2.4. The PCM will brief patients on emergency egress, exit prohibitions, and
       hazards. Ambulatory patients will remain seated but will not wear seatbelts during CS.
       When possible, the PCM should conduct the briefing prior to servicing.
       20.8.2.5. Loading ramps/stairs are in place for immediate use and exits (excluding the
       overhead escape hatches) are opened for egress.
       20.8.2.6. At least two qualified AECMs (one must be a FN) will remain onboard to
       observe patients and assist patients in the event of an egress.
       20.8.2.7. The PIC, designated aircrew representative, or CSS will advise PCMs and
       AECMs when to evacuate patients.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                    245


       20.8.2.8. Patients will not enter or exit the aircraft during servicing. Crewmembers may
       enter or exit the aircraft only when performing essential duties associated with the
       concurrent servicing operation. Individuals must properly ground themselves before
       boarding the aircraft.
       20.8.2.9. If cabin lights, electrical power to operate medical equipment and aircraft inter-
       phone are operating prior to refueling, use may be continued during servicing operations
       provided it does not radiate energy. (Do not turn electronic equipment on or off during
       refueling.) EXCEPTION: Only those systems, switches or electrical circuits needed to
       operate equipment to sustain life, may be turned on and used during refueling.
       20.8.2.10. Activities around the aircraft will be kept to a minimum during the refueling
       process. Onload/Offload patient and passenger baggage prior to or after refueling.
       20.8.2.11. The PCM will set the interior lighting as bright as possible to suit the combat
       environment.
       20.8.2.12. Do not use the on board toilet facilities during servicing.
20.9. Aircraft Configuration.
   20.9.1. On designated ARM and operational AE missions, configure the aircraft during pre-
   flight per TO 1C-17A-9 and AFI 11-2AE V3 Addenda A.
   20.9.2. Litter Support Provisions.
       20.9.2.1. Roller conveyors will be stowed from all aisle way, walkway, and AE litter
       patient positions.
       20.9.2.2. On the ramp, roller conveyors will be stowed unless the baggage pallet or
       LSAS are in position. Before enplaning/deplaning procedures, the LSAS will be secured
       in the Aerial Delivery System (ADS) Rails in position 10. All rollers in position 11 will
       be stowed.
   20.9.3. Available litter spaces and ambulatory seating will depend on the aircraft cabin‘s
   mission configuration.
   20.9.4. AECMs will have portable oxygen available. AECMs normally use an MA-1
   portable oxygen bottle. If MA-1 bottles are not available, PBE‘s may be used as portable
   oxygen.
   20.9.5. Do not secure aircraft or medical equipment adjacent to an emergency exit in a
   manner that will prevent or impede egress.
   20.9.6. Life Preservers. Use the Adult/Child life preserver for patients.
20.10. Passengers and Cargo.
20.10.1. The PIC, with the concurrence of the MCD, will ensure maximum aircraft utilization
for passengers and cargo. Passenger restrictions based upon patient considerations will be
identified when seats are released. The PIC will advise the appropriate C2 agency of the number
seats available for passengers.
   20.10.2. Cargo and passengers may be carried with patients unless a clear detriment to the
   health and well being of the patient or passengers can be demonstrated. The decision will be
246                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


  made by the MCD, considering the need for maximum utilization of the aircraft. Refer to
  AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Air Shipments for hazardous product
  special provisions rating. P4 and P5 rated hazardous material have no AE restrictions.
  Conflicts will be referred to the respective tasking AE command element for decision. Litter
  patients will be positioned forward of cargo pallets. EXCEPTION: If cargo is in place, and
  the PIC and MCD agree, patients may be transported aft of the cargo. The MCD and
  loadmaster will ensure patient egress is not affected by mixed cargo/patient loads.
  20.10.3. Cargo will not be bumped except in unusual/abnormal cases, and only after the
  MCD has coordinated with the PIC and notified the tasking AE command element.
  20.10.4. Do not move ambulatory patients to litters in order to provide seating for additional
  patients or passengers.
  20.10.5. Patient Therapeutic Liquid Oxygen (PT LOX) may be transported for positioning
  and de-positioning AE Crews. A maximum of 25 PTLOX serviced units may be transported
  simultaneously without Hazmat certification. Processing through aerial port is not required.
  If shipping more than six PTLOX containers as cargo, do not cover with plastic. This will
  prevent potential high concentration of oxygen levels. WARNING: Ensure the cargo floor is
  free from any oil or petroleum products.
  20.10.6. AE Movement of Contaminated/Contagious Personnel. It is United States
  Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) policy that patients personnel, or casualties
  with known or suspected contamination from chemical, biological, or nuclear warfare agents
  will not be transported within the aeromedical patient movement system. Decontamination
  must be performed prior to transport to prevent the potential spread of contamination. In rare
  cases, transport may be essential to preserve life or continue critical missions. If such
  transport is deemed essential, all efforts must be made to prevent the spread of
  contamination. In these cases, prior approval must be given by the involved geographic
  combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and the Secretary of Defense
  (SECDEF) in consultation with Department of Defense medical authorities.
      20.10.6.1. Patients with known or suspected or highly contagious disease will not be
      transported within the patient movement system. These include infections with any agent
      that may pose a potential threat to national security, require special public health actions,
      and/or have the potential to cause public panic and social disruption. Patients known or
      suspected to be infected with a highly contagious disease should be treated ―in place‖ or
      with minimal transportation to medical authorities. In extreme circumstances there may
      be a requirement to move index cases (approximately two) for evaluation or critical
      medical care. If patient movement is required, prior approval must be given by the
      involved geographic combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and
      SECDEF in consultation with medical authorities.
      20.10.6.2. AMC will train and equip AE crews and stage required equipment at key hubs
      to carry out these limited missions for movement of contaminated and contagious
      patients. NOTE: If AECMs are utilizing the MCU-2A ground chemical mask, a FL
      below 10,000 feet is recommended due to reported valve failure during rapid
      decompression.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                   247


20.11. Crash/Fire/Rescue.
   20.11.1. Aircraft carrying patient(s) will be provided CFR protection per TO 00-25-172.
   When concurrent fuel servicing with patients/passengers on board a major aircraft rescue and
   fire vehicle will be available to respond within three minutes or as determined by the base
   Fire Chief. (NOTE: When servicing with JP-4 or Jet B Fuel, a major aircraft rescue and fire
   vehicle will be positioned at the aircraft).The flight crew will coordinate CFR requirements.
   20.11.2. At non-AMC bases, non-U.S. military bases, and civilian airfields, the controlling
   agency will coordinate the CFR coverage, as necessary. The request for CFR vehicle
   coverage may be denied. This will not prevent refueling operations from occurring.
20.12. AE Call Sign/Use of Priority Clearance.
   20.12.1. AIR EVAC Priority. If a medical emergency occurs during flight, and is determined
   by the MCD to be an urgent situation, a request for AIR EVAC Priority will be requested.
   The PIC may request ―AIR EVAC priority‖ for preferential ATC handling if a delay will
   affect a patient‘s well being. AIR EVAC priority will only be used for that portion of the
   flight requiring expedited handling. Do not request priority for routine air evacuations to
   avoid ATC delays or inconveniences. It is the PIC‘s responsibility to use this option only for
   bona fide medical situations that demand priority handling. Use this status judiciously.
20.13. Load Message.
   20.13.1. The MCD will complete an AF Form 3858, C-130/C-141 Aeromedical Evacuation
   Mission Offload Message and coordinate for transmission of patient information to C2 a
   minimum of 30 minutes prior to estimated time of arrival.
20.14. ERO Procedures.
   20.14.1. ERO procedures are outlined in AFI 11-2AE Volume 3. ERO procedures for
   loading patients are authorized for contingency operations or when AE mission requirements
   dictate minimum ground time. ERO procedures can be practiced/trained during ARMs, static
   trainers, joint training operations, exercises, etc. EROs will not be used in a non-contingency
   environment unless mission essential. For the C-17, eye protection is not necessary, except
   when operating in parking areas where flying debris could be picked up from engine exhaust.
   20.14.2. AECM‘s may exit the aircraft to conduct ground duties if not contradicted by
   Intel/SPINS (Special Instructions).
   20.14.3. The loadmaster will be positioned on the left side, at the foot of the ramp and on
   headset during actual on-load procedures.
   20.14.4. Baggage will be loaded on the aircraft ramp and will not impede emergency egress.
   20.14.5. If duties permit, loadmasters will assist AECMs with securing baggage.
20.15. Floor Loading Procedures.
   20.15.1. Floor loading of patients is authorized for all contingency operations when a time
   critical environment exists (i.e. non-secure landing zones, areas faced with enemy
   siege/hostile fire, humanitarian reasons, etc.), and minimum ground time is essential. Floor
   loading procedures can be practiced/trained during aeromedical readiness missions (ARMs),
   joint training operations, exercises, etc. The cargo/ramp floor will be configured with all

  rollers stowed (cargo permitting). Maximum altitude for floor loaded patients is FL 350.
  Patients will have an EPOS pre-positioned on their litter when floor loaded.
      20.15.1.1. Ambulatory Patients. If available, any cushioning material may be used for
      seating, to prevent the patient from having to sit on the cargo floor. Seat patients facing
      forward in the aircraft. Attach a cargo tie-down strap for each row of patients, in a
      manner that it will provide forward restraint and body stability.
      20.15.1.2. Litter Patients. Refer to AFI 11-2AE V3 Addenda A for litter
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                  249

              EMERGENCY NUCLEAR AIRLIFT OPERATIONS (ENAO)

Section 21A—Mission Preparation

21.1. General. The objective is to move nuclear weapons safely. You may be tasked at any
time to airlift nuclear weapons. The amount of preparation time and degree of assistance you
receive will depend on the length of time the MAJCOM has to move the weapons.
21.2. Conduct of Operations. Crews should be briefed and receive detailed instructions from a
specific OPLAN or mission directive. If there is a conflict between this instruction and the
requirements in an OPLAN or mission directive, use the OPLAN or mission directive.
21.3. Emergency Nuclear Airlift Standards. Crews are expected to use sound judgment and
common sense in what may be a turbulent or tense environment. Pay particular attention to the
following areas:
   21.3.1. Nuclear weapons must be handled safely. The most immediate hazard is the high
   explosive that can be set off by shock or heat in most nuclear weapons. Keep loading
   operations controlled and orderly at all times. Load or handle only one item or pallet at a
   time. Shipper and receiver personnel are highly trained in nuclear cargo movements and
   should be used to assist in cargo loading operations and tiedown. The overall aircraft loading
   responsibility still belongs to the aircrew.
   21.3.2. Use standard TO 1C-17-9 loading procedures.
       21.3.2.1. For mixed loads (more than one type of weapon), base the load plan on how
       many weapons can be properly restrained using T.O 1C-17A-9criteria. Do not allow
       weapons to rub or touch each other when tied down.
   21.3.3. The T.O 1C-17A-16-1- is an excellent guide to use when planning the maximum
   density logistic movement of a single weapon type. The tiedown patterns will aid crews in
   floor planning a maximum tested load. The T.O 1C-17A-16-1is also a useful guide for
   positioning approach, rolling, parking, and step-up shoring. Step-by-step use of the T.O 1C-
   17A-16-1is not necessary.
   21.3.4. The route of flight must not violate restrictions in the classified United States Air
   Force Special Weapons Over-flight Guide (SWOG). Over-flight of a foreign country with
   nuclear weapons is an extremely sensitive issue. Comply with SWOG instructions at all
   times. Crews without access to the SWOG, will request a route of flight that complies with
   the SWOG through command and control center (C2 agency) channels, 618 AOC
   (TACC/XOCG), DSN 779-0323. The C2 agency must ensure the route of flight is provided
   to the aircrew by the most expeditious means available. If no route of flight is provided, fly
   normal air traffic control (ATC) routings to the destination. Do not divulge the nature of
   cargo to any en route ATC facility or country to obtain a specific clearance.
21.4. Aircrew Selection. All active duty aircrews may be used for ENAO. Time permitting,
AMC will use a sliding scale of options, which may be one or more of the following:
 250                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   21.4.1. Assign Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) loadmasters (LM) and pilots so as to
   have one or the other on each aircraft.
   21.4.2. Place PNAF pilot and LM teams at the onload bases to assist with the loads and
   flight plans.
   21.4.3. Use non-PNAF crews in a prepared OPLAN scenario with planned, organized loads.
   21.4.4. Use non-PNAF crews in a short notice, bare-base environment with little or no
   advance preparation or assistance.
   21.4.5. Use ARC crews with Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) approval.
21.5. Aircrew Requirements.
   21.5.1. Crew complement will be according to the OPLAN or specific mission directive. If
   not specified, use a normal crew complement.
   21.5.2. The crew will be armed (courier and two additional crewmembers).
   21.5.3. Crewmembers tasked for a mission that has a higher security classification than their
   personnel security clearance will be authorized emergency access to enough information to
   complete the mission. Approval authority rests with a general officer, wing commander, or
   wing commander equivalent and cannot be delegated.
21.6. Aircrew Briefings.
   21.6.1. A controlling agency or delegated representative will conduct a predeparture or
   enroute briefing for aircrew members prior to executing an active leg of ENAO. The
   controlling agency can pass classified mission information to the crew through the Shipping
   Agency. The aircraft commander will brief anyone who joins the mission enroute. Aircrews
   should be briefed on the following:
       21.6.1.1. Purpose of the mission.
       21.6.1.2. Classification of the mission, cargo, and locations.
       21.6.1.3. Itinerary, including confirmation of prior coordination for hazardous material
       as required by instrument flight rule (IFR) supplement and alternate airfields.
       21.6.1.4. Cargo. TO 11N-20-11 line numbers should be included. Obtain line numbers
       from the controlling agency or the shipper prior to loading. TO 11N-20-11 is a classified
       technical order that assigns an unclassified line number to each nuclear weapon.
          21.6.1.4.1. Restrictions on transporting additional general cargo or passengers.
       21.6.1.5. ―No lone zone,‖ two-person concept, and security requirements.
       21.6.1.6. Personnel authorized to sign for nuclear weapons at the destination.
       21.6.1.7. Current intelligence, including threat analysis.
       21.6.1.8. SWOG route of flight restrictions and air refueling restrictions.
       21.6.1.9. Airborne intercept (SWOG).
       21.6.1.10. Jettisoning (SWOG).
       21.6.1.11. Command Disable System (CDS) procedures.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                      251


21.7. Nuclear Airlift Publications.
   21.7.1. To the maximum extent possible, the consolidated trip kit should include the
   following nuclear publications:
       21.7.1.1. TO 1C-17-16-1, Loading and Air Transport of Nuclear Weapon Cargo (Non-
       palletized).
       21.7.1.2. TO 1C-17-16-2, Loading and Air Transport of Nuclear Weapon Cargo
       (Palletized).
   21.7.2. AFI 11-299, Nuclear Airlift Operations". HQ AMC/A3NA (DSN 779-0074) is the
   OPR.
   21.7.3. AFI 91-115, Safety Rules for Nuclear Logistics Transport by the Prime Nuclear
   Airlift Force.

Section 21B—En Route Procedures

21.8. General. Use these procedures in addition to the normal operating procedures in the rest
of this regulation.
   21.8.1. Flight Plans. Enter ―hazardous cargo‖ and the mission number in the ―other
   information‖ section of the flight plan. Crews carrying inert weapons, trainers, or other items
   that could be mistaken for real weapons by crash or rescue personnel in an emergency will
   enter ―inert devices.‖
   21.8.2. Radio Calls:
       21.8.2.1. Departure (onload) base. Before starting the onload, tell the tower to notify the
       fire department the ―onload is commencing.‖ Prior to engine start, give the controlling
       agency (ground or tower) the parking location and approximate engine start time and
       announce there is hazardous cargo aboard the aircraft. Ensure a fire truck is standing by
       the aircraft for engine start.
       21.8.2.2. En route or offload base. At least 30 minutes prior to landing, contact one of
       the following: base operations, command post, or control tower. Pass mission number
       and verify that the hazardous cargo information has been received. If the arrival base
       does not have hazardous cargo information, request the following be relayed immediately
       to the crash or fire protection agency and other support agencies as appropriate:
          21.8.2.2.1. Aircraft call sign, type, and mission number.
          21.8.2.2.2. Estimated time of arrival (ETA).
          21.8.2.2.3. Department of Transportation (DOT) explosives hazard class or division
          (normally 1.1).
          21.8.2.2.4. Net explosive weight (NEW).
          21.8.2.2.5. Line numbers from TO 11N-20-11 if requested. Obtain line numbers
          from the base fire department prior to starting the load at the onload location.
          21.8.2.2.6. A request for isolated parking and security forces to meet the aircraft.
 252                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


21.9. Custody of Nuclear Cargo. The courier must be a commissioned officer. A copilot or
third pilot is the preferred option. The courier officer is responsible for receipt, custody,
security, safety, and delivery of nuclear weapons to authorized receivers. Under certain
conditions, the shipper may furnish United States military couriers who will retain custody of the
weapons in flight.
   21.9.1. Prior to accepting and loading nuclear cargo, the shipper will brief the courier officer
   on the nature and hazards of the cargo. The courier will brief all crewmembers who didn't
   receive the shipper's briefing prior to flight. Ask the shipper to point out any specifics crews
   may need to handle the weapon, i.e. tiedown points, forklift stirrups, command disable
   system (CDS) procedures, etc.
   21.9.2. Time permitting, the courier and LM will inspect the cargo before accepting custody.
   The courier should have the shipper verify the integrity of a weapons case and replace any
   broken seals. Crews may be held responsible for damage at the receiving end if crews accept
   a damaged weapon without documentation. Document damage or broken seals on the DD
   Form 1911, Materiel Courier Receipt, prior to signing for the weapon.
       21.9.2.1. Loadmasters will inspect weapons to ensure they are secured to carriers,
       conditions of tiedown rings, and condition of wheel casters etc.
   21.9.3. The courier accepts custody of the weapon by signing the DD Form 1911 provided
   by the shipper. Use this form to transfer cargo custody to replacement couriers.
   21.9.4. Release custody of the cargo only to a replacement courier or someone authorized to
   sign for nuclear material. Authorized receivers are identified by the shipper, by message, or
   through the AMC command and control system.
   21.9.5. Time permitting, refer any questions through the 618 AOC (TACC/XOCG), DSN
   779-0323 for resolution.
21.10. Security Procedures. The host base is responsible for providing security for the aircraft
and the nuclear cargo. The courier officer (who has custody of the weapons) is the final
authority on security matters; however, crews should follow the advice and procedures of the
host security force as much as possible. If the situation is serious and crews must load and
depart quickly, use judgment and dispense with the formalities. Prior to takeoff, the AC will
ensure security support at all stations being transited that day through the 618 AOC (TACC).
   21.10.1. Home Station. Conduct a thorough visual search of the aircraft for unauthorized
   explosives or stowaways. Use a bomb detection dog if available. If time is critical, do not
   delay the mission to ―sanitize‖ the aircraft.
   21.10.2. Onload Base. The host base should set up a restricted area, normally with ropes and
   stanchions, around the aircraft.
       21.10.2.1. Entry Control. Use one entry point to maintain strict control of entry into the
       area. The entry controller will have a roster of all personnel allowed to enter. Use a copy
       of the flight orders for the aircrew. Instruct the entry controller to coordinate with the
       aircrew courier before allowing anyone into the area. EXCEPTION: Allow the weapons
       convoy to enter the restricted area without delay.
       21.10.2.2. ―No lone zone.‖ Do not allow anyone to be alone in the restricted area or
       aircraft when nuclear weapons are present (inside either the area or the aircraft). The
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                    253


      purpose of a ―no lone zone‖ is to prevent any one person from tampering with a nuclear
      weapon. The easiest way to enforce a ―no lone zone‖ is to always be in pairs inside the
      restricted area (for example, two aircrew members, two shippers, or one aircrew member
      and one shipper). Maintain the two-person concept throughout the flight. Do not allow
      anyone to be alone in the cargo compartment, crew rest area and/or cockpit.
   21.10.3. Arrival or En Route Base. If security forces do not meet the aircraft, the aircraft
   commander must be prepared for an immediate departure until security is established.
   Immediately upon block-in, the courier and security team will deplane. The aircrew will keep
   the aircraft engines running, all aircraft doors closed and delay preparation for nuclear cargo
   transfer until the courier verifies appropriate security is in place. CDS codes (if issued) must
   remain onboard the aircraft (normally with the copilot) until custody is transferred to the
   receiving authority. Once security is established, the only personnel authorized near the
   aircraft are aircrew members and those support personnel necessary to install landing gear
   pins, ground power and wheel chocks. Monitor these people at all time.
21.11. Emergency Procedures.
   21.11.1. Security Emergencies. Crews may use deadly force to protect nuclear cargo and
   will resist any attempt by a hostile force to capture a nuclear weapon. Consider any attack on
   an aircraft loaded with nuclear cargo, including a hijacking attempt, as an attack against the
   nuclear weapons. Should hostages be used to gain access to, as cover for removal, or to
   thwart recovery of a nuclear weapon; the welfare and safety of the hostages should be
   considered in determining actions to be taken. However, the presence of hostages shall not
   deter the taking of decisive, prompt, and effective action that includes the use of deadly force
   to recover a nuclear weapon and to prevent unauthorized access to or removal of a nuclear
   weapon. If crews are attacked, take the following actions:
      21.11.1.1. Make an immediate takeoff, with the cargo if possible.
      21.11.1.2. If the attack occurs during onloading or offloading, load the weapons as fast
      and as safely as possible. Ensure sufficient cargo restraint and takeoff immediately.
      21.11.1.3. Some weapons are equipped with a CDS that internally destroys the capability
      of a weapon to achieve a significant nuclear yield. The CDS will be used when capture
      of a weapon is imminent.
      21.11.1.4. Aircrews will not use emergency destruct procedures on nuclear weapons.
      Emergency destruction (ED) of weapons by shaped charges requires SECDEF approval
      and will be accomplished by qualified personnel who have the capability to receive,
      authenticate, and carry out ED orders. When two properly identified shipper or receiver
      personnel concurrently request custody of the cargo for ED purposes, release the cargo
      using appropriate custody transfer procedures.
   21.11.2. Jettisoning Nuclear Cargo. The LM will identify which cargo is jettisonable IAW
   the T.O 1C-17A-1. The aircraft commander bears a moral obligation to jettison cargo or
   crash-land where the least amount of damage will result. Use the CDS, if applicable, prior to
   jettisoning or crash-landing. Record the coordinates of each jettisoned item. Observe the
   jettison restrictions in the SWOG.
 254                               AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


   21.11.3. Landing in Foreign Countries. Be prudent and keep things very low key. If
   confronted with demands to board or inspect the aircraft, refer to the status of US military
   aircraft in the DOD Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG), which states: US military aircraft are
   sovereign instrumentalities. US military aircraft cleared to overfly or land in a foreign
   territory are entitled to the privileges and immunities customarily accorded to warships.
   These privileges and immunities include, in the absence of stipulations to the contrary,
   exemption from duties and taxation; immunity from search, seizure, and inspections
   (including customs and safety inspection); or other exercise or jurisdiction by the host nation
   over the aircraft, personnel, equipment, or cargo on board. Air Force aircraft commanders
   will not authorize search, seizure, inspection, or similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated
   above by foreign authorities except by direction of HQ USAF or the American Embassy in
   the country concerned. Diplomatically, but firmly, refuse any requests to board or inspect,
   and get help through any available United States channel. Flash priority is authorized.
21.12. Maintenance and Servicing on Aircraft Loaded with Nuclear Cargo.
   21.12.1. Maintenance on an aircraft loaded with nuclear weapons must not violate safety
   rules normally used with aircraft loaded with conventional explosives. As much as possible,
   have maintenance and servicing completed before loading nuclear weapons on the aircraft.
   Do not allow maintenance, such as the following, that could increase the possibility of a fire:
       21.12.1.1. Using flame or uncontrolled heat-producing items.
       21.12.1.2. Repairs on the fuel system, cell, and tank or other maintenance where
       significant fuel spills are likely to result from disconnected lines, ruptured components,
       etc.
   21.12.2. Aircraft will not be jacked. The temporary lifting of one set of landing gear
   "integral jacking" for minor maintenance (tire change, brake change, bogie maintenance, etc.)
   is not considered aircraft jacking.
   21.12.3. Have a fire truck standing by at the aircraft during refueling, defueling, or oxygen
   servicing. Do not refuel, defuel, integral jack, or service oxygen while loading or offloading
   nuclear weapons.
   21.12.4. An aircrew member will monitor all maintenance on the aircraft while nuclear
   cargo is on board.

Section 21C—Emergency Nuclear Airlift Operations Guide

21.13. General. This guide describes recommended actions for courier and crew during
emergency nuclear airlift operations. It is designed for those missions diverted en route to an
onload site where the crew does not have the opportunity to receive a formal Contingency
Response Element (CRE)., home station, or command post briefing. However, even if a formal
briefing is given, this guide may be used as a refresher. Security, time, and ground support may
not be sufficient to allow using this guide during emergency operations. In such cases, the
courier and crew must discuss all factors and use their judgment on the best course of action to
accomplish the mission. Safety and security is paramount in all decisions affecting
transportation of nuclear cargo.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                   255


21.14. Prior to Onload (either at home station or enroute to the onload site).
   21.14.1. Review crew responsibilities and the procedures to be used during onload (loading
   method, security setup, cargo receipt, two-person concept). Do not discuss classified
   information over inter-phone.
   21.14.2. If time permits, review the applicable section of the T.O 1C-17A-16-1. Use of the
   T.O 1C-17A-16-1 is not mandatory, but it may provide useful loading information for the
   cargo, such as parking and rolling shoring requirements and tiedown patterns.
   21.14.3. En route and 30 minutes prior to landing, contact the onload site and notify them of
   estimated time of arrival (ETA). Make support requirements known (fuel, materials handling
   equipment (MHE), transportation, security, etc.) at this time.
   21.14.4. If time permits and the equipment is readily available, install the Combat Track II
   system.
21.15. Arrival and Onload.
   21.15.1. Contact the senior security official and comply with the following: If crews have
   nuclear cargo on board, establish a restricted area and keep everyone off the aircraft. Provide
   armed security until the host security forces assume responsibility.
       21.15.1.1. A restricted area will be established around the aircraft. Ropes and stanchions
       are normally used to denote the restricted area. However, depending on the situation,
       crews may see additional guards, security vehicles, etc., rather than ropes. Be flexible.
       The key is whether the host base is furnishing enough security to protect the nuclear
       cargo.
       21.15.1.2. A single entry control point will be established.
   21.15.2. The entry controller must allow only those individuals into the restricted area who
   have been cleared by the courier. Tell the entry controller which individuals are authorized
   into the area and, time permitting, use crew orders as an entry authorization lists (EAL) and
   prepared shipper lists.
   21.15.3. After security is established, verify shipper identification and accomplish the
   following with the shipper: (NOTE: Accomplish the shipper briefing and cargo inspection if
   time and the security environment permit.)
       21.15.3.1. Shipper briefing to include the following:
          21.15.3.1.1. Nature, hazard, and safety regarding shipment of nuclear weapons cargo,
          including line numbers from TO 11N-20-11, DOD class explosive hazard class or
          division, and net explosive weight (NEW).
          21.15.3.1.2. Courier escort requirements.
          21.15.3.1.3. Items requiring the two-person concept.
          21.15.3.1.4. Items that are command disable system (CDS) equipped and if the CDS
          has been activated (weapon not operational).
          21.15.3.1.5. Items exposed to an abnormal environment or not operational.
          21.15.3.1.6. Special handling or unique requirements particular to the cargo.
 256                                AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013


          21.15.3.1.7. Individuals required to assist during onload or offload. Pass the
          information to the entry controller.
          21.15.3.1.8. Authorized recipients at offload station. Get this information in writing.
       21.15.3.2. Cargo inspection:
          21.15.3.2.1. The primary LM, courier, and shipper will inspect the cargo for broken
          seals, exterior damage, security to carrier, wheel and casters, tiedown points, etc.
          Have the shipper annotate any discovered damage or discrepancies on the DD Form
          1911, Materiel Courier Receipt. NOTE: Ensure the aircraft is ready for onload prior
          to accepting custody of nuclear cargo.
          21.15.3.2.2. After the inspection and all cargo is uploaded, accept custody of the
          cargo by signing the DD Form 1911. CDS codes (if issued) must remain onboard the
          aircraft (normally with copilot) until custody is transferred to the receiving authority.
   21.15.4. During onload or offload monitor the operation, assist as necessary, and ensure
   personnel comply with the two-person concept.
   21.15.5. After cargo onload is complete and the crew is ready for engine start, the armed
   courier will deplane and tell the host base security to break down security and maintain
   surveillance until aircraft departure. The courier and other armed crewmembers will monitor
   access to the aircraft and crew entrance door during engine start.
21.16. En Route to Offload.
   21.16.1. Maintain the two-person concept.
   21.16.2. Notify the 618 AOC (TACC) of departure time and ETA at the offload station. Be
   prepared to encode this information.
   21.16.3. If time permits, review the security and handling procedures to be used at the
   offload station. Do not discuss classified information over the interphone.
   21.16.4. Contact the agency specified in flight information publications (command post,
   base operations, or tower) 30 minutes prior to landing; ask if they have hazardous cargo
   information. If they don‘t, pass the following information:
       21.16.4.1. Call sign, type aircraft, and mission number.
       21.16.4.2. ETA.
       21.16.4.3. Line numbers from TO 11N-20-11 or DD Form 1911.
       21.16.4.4. If line numbers were not provided, pass on the following information:
          21.16.4.4.1. DOD explosive hazard class or division (normally 1.1).
          21.16.4.4.2. NEW.
       21.16.4.5. A request for isolated parking and for their security forces to meet the aircraft.
       21.16.4.6. Inert devices, if applicable.
AFI11-2C-17V3_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 FEBRUARY 2013                                                     257
