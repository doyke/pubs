1. Policy.
     1.1. The grading scale and academic course-numbering system for degree programs were
     established by the AU Registrar with the approval of the Air War College (AWC), Air
     Command and Staff College (ACSC), and School of Advanced Air and Space Studies
     (SAASS) academic deans. When adopted in May 1999, SAASS had already adopted the
     grading scale and course numbering system.
     1.2. All students in degree programs will receive course grades based on a four-point system
     which plus and minus grades can be utilized. Academic courses that make up a degree
     program are numbered in accordance with guidance in this instruction.
2. Grading Symbols.
     2.1. To measure scholastic attainment of students enrolled in AU degree programs use the
     grading symbols and corresponding quality points at Table 2.1:

     Table 2.1. Grading Symbols.

      Grading          Quality Points
      Symbol
             A                 4.0
             A-                3.7
             B+                3.3
             B                 3.0
             B-                2.7
             C+                2.3
             C                 2.0
             C-                1.7
             D                 1.0
             F                 0
     2.2. Explanation of Grading Symbols.
        2.2.1. Grades A through F are normally awarded at completion of course requirements.
        2.2.2. In addition to grading symbols in Table 2.1, Pass (Pass) and Fail (No Pass) grades
        may be awarded for designated courses according to school policy. Pass grades count
        only toward hours attempted/earned and do not affect the grade point average (GPA).
        Fail (No Pass) grades count only as hours attempted but do not count as hours earned nor
        do they affect the GPA.

3. Course Numbering for Degree Programs.
   3.1. The academic course numbering system for graduate programs at AWC, ACSC,
   USAFTPS and SAASS includes an alpha prefix of up to four letters (SAASS exception) plus
   a three or four-digit number.
      3.1.1. The alpha prefix designates the subject area or type of course (elective) for AWC,
      ACSC and USAFTPS. At SAASS, the school’s original acronym – SAAS – was used as
      the alpha prefix. That alpha prefix was changed to SAASS when the name changed from
      School of Advanced Airpower Studies (SAAS) to School of Advanced Air and Space
      Studies (SAASS).
      3.1.2. Table 3.1. identifies the numbering series for academic courses that make up the
      degree programs.

      Table 3.1. Numbering Series.

       School       Numbering Series      Degree Program
       ACSC         5500                  Master of Military Operational Art & Science
                    5600
       ACSC         5300                  Master of Military Operational Art & Science
                                          Concentrations
       AWC          6000                  Master of Strategic Studies
       SAASS        600                   Master of Philosophy in Military Strategy
       USAFTPS 5400                       Master of Science in Flight Test Engineering
   3.2. Other master’s degree programs offered in the future will use 5000-5299 to designate
   the academic courses that comprise such programs.
   3.3. Undergraduate degree programs offered in the future will use the 3000 and 4000 series
   for upper-level baccalaureate programs.
   3.4. Changes or additions to course numbering for degree programs will be coordinated with
   the AU Registrar IAW AUI 36-2306, Air University Educational Program Review.
4. Determining amount and level of credit awarded for courses
   4.1. Air University employs sound and acceptable practices for determining the amount and
   level of credit awarded for courses, regardless of format or mode of delivery.
   4.2. Generally 15 contact hours equate to 1 semester hour of academic credit.
