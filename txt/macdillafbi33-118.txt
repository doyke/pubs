for Users of Unlicensed Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Part 15 Devices.
1. Applicability. This instruction applies to all users with equipment that radiates in the
electromagnetic spectrum.
2. General: The radio frequency spectrum is a limited natural resource that is accessible to all
nations. It is imperative that we develop and administer our use of this resource wisely to
maintain a free democratic society while ensuring its availability to serve future requirements.
Therefore, the national objective for the use of the radio spectrum is to make effective, efficient,
and prudent use of the spectrum in the best interest of the nation.

4. Frequency Management Lifecycle
     4.1. Application for Radio Frequencies and Lead Times:
        4.1.1. Spectrum users in the vicinity of MacDill AFB will request radio frequencies
        through the ISM. The ISM will then coordinate with AMC who will in turn coordinate
        with Air Force Spectrum Management Office (AFSMO).
        4.1.2. Requesters must give AFSMO at least 60 calendar days lead time for frequency
        proposals.
        4.1.3. A fill-in-the-blank information worksheet is provided upon request to unit
        frequency monitors to assist in preparation.
        4.1.4. Requests that do not allow for the prescribed lead time must be accompanied by an
        impact statement justifying the urgency and signed by the using activity commander.
        4.1.5. Frequency managers for United States Central Command, United States Special
        Operations Command, JCSE, and other tenant units will coordinate frequency requests
        with the ISM if the requested frequencies will be used on MacDill AFB.
     4.2. Frequency Assignment. A frequency assignment is an authorization to operate, within
     prescribed parameters, electronic equipment that emits radio frequency energy. Assignments
     will be provided through AMC channels to the ISM, who will, in turn, forward the
     authorization to the requesting units.
     4.3. Radio Frequency Modification. An assignment modification is the addition,
     substitution, or removal of any item in an existing frequency assignment, i.e.,
     increase/decrease antenna height or gain, change antenna locations, change equipment used,
     increase/decrease power, etc. (except serial number, frequency, and state). Organizations
     must contact the ISM for assistance in obtaining the necessary national level approval
     PRIOR to obligating funds or any physical changes occurring. Tenant units will submit
     similar requests through their parent major command channels after coordination with the
     ISM. As stated earlier, the AFSMO requires at least 60 calendar days to process frequency
     modifications.
     4.4. Radio Frequency Deletions. Send deletion requests to the ISM as soon as the
     frequency is no longer needed. Requests for deletions will be submitted by letter to the ISM
     from the unit desiring the action. The request shall contain frequency or frequencies to be
     deleted and the serial number(s). Serial numbers can be found on the assignment
     authorization message (item 102). Tenant organizations will submit deletion requests
     through their parent major command, with an information copy to the ISM. Do not request
     deletions if the need for the frequency ends within 120 days of the assignment expiration
     date.
5. Rules and Conditions Governing Use of Assigned Frequency or Frequencies. Each
organization authorized use of a frequency or frequencies is responsible for ensuring compliance
with the following provisions:
     5.1. Maintaining the authorization document for each frequency in use.
     5.2. Ensuring equipment emitting radio frequency energy is within the limitations and
     tolerances stated in the RFA.
MACDILLAFBI33-118 12 NOVEMBER 2013                                                               5


   5.3. Following Air Force frequency management directives.
   5.4. Reviewing assigned frequencies annually and requesting deletion of frequencies no
   longer required.
   5.5. Using radiation suppression devices (dummy loads) to the maximum extent when
   testing, tuning, or experimenting. This will alleviate the possibility of inadvertent
   interference to other users.
6. Air Force Spectrum Interference Resolution (AFSIR) Program. The focus of the AFSIR
program is to resolve electromagnetic interference (EMI) at the lowest level. A unit affected by
an EMI incident must investigate to identify the source and the unit POC must submit initial,
supplemental, and closing reports to the ISM IAW paragraph 6.2. The ISM will submit initial,
supplemental, and closing reports through AMC to AFSMO. AFI 10-707 provides guidance for
preparing the report.
   6.1. The unit POC shall take the following steps when EMI is encountered:
       6.1.1. Check with equipment maintenance personnel to determine if the EMI is the result
       of maintenance action or an equipment malfunction.
       6.1.2. Check with other units in the geographical area to determine the area affected.
       (Knowing if other nearby units are experiencing the same type of EMI may aid in
       determining the interference source.)
       6.1.3. Keep a log of all pertinent information on the interference, i.e., frequencies,
       description of the interference, dates/times, etc., that will be used for the report.
       6.1.4. Contact the ISM or the Communications Focal Point at 828-2666, after duty hours,
       to have the ISM assist in the preparation of the EMI report.
   6.2. Types of EMI Reports.
       6.2.1. Initial Report. File as soon as possible, within 24 hours of the occurrence, after an
       EMI incident occurs.
       6.2.2. Supplemental or Follow-On Reports.         Submit to add or modify information
       previously submitted.
       6.2.3. Closing Report. Submit when the EMI incident is resolved or requires no further
       action.
   6.3. Exceptions to Reporting. Do not report an incident when:
       6.3.1. The interference is transient EMI from natural source (for example, rain, solar
       activity, lightning, etc.).
       6.3.2. The interference only affects training frequencies assigned on a non-interference
       basis for training purposes.
7. Users of Unlicensed Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Part 15 Devices. Part
15 devices are authorized to be utilized under FCC regulations on DoD installations. However,
by utilizing these devices the user understands that they do not have any protection from harmful
interference. In addition, if this piece of equipment is found to interfere with licensed equipment

it would be required to be relocated or possibly shut down. If two Part 15 devices are found to
interfere with each other the installation commander will decide which device takes precedence.
8. Contacting the ISM. The ISM can be contacted by calling the Communications Focal Point
at 813-828-2666 or DSN 968-2666.
