1.1. Scope. In conjunction with other governing directives, this instruction prescribes
procedures for operating the E-8C under most circumstances. It is not a substitute for sound
judgment or common sense. Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be
accomplished if they enhance safe and or effective mission accomplishment.
1.2. Deviations. Deviations from these procedures require specific approval of the
MAJCOM/A3 unless an urgent requirement or an aircraft emergency dictates otherwise. In that
case, the pilot in command (PIC) will take appropriate action to safely recover the aircraft and
notify the appropriate C2 agency, time and conditions permitting.
1.3. Waivers. Unless specifically noted otherwise in the appropriate section, waiver authority
for requirements of this instruction is HQ ACC/A3. Submit waiver requests through channels to
NGB/A3 and HQ ACC/A3Y.
1.4. Local Supplement Coordination Process. The 116 WG/OG will define additional local
operating procedures to this instruction in a unit supplement. The procedures will not duplicate,
alter, amend, or be less restrictive than the provisions of this basic AFI and/or flight manual
publications. OG/CCs will forward one copy for validation to HQ ACC/A3YA, and if applicable
through 8 AF prior to releasing their supplement.
1.5. Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Terms. See Attachment 1.

                                   MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Mission Development/Planning. The Squadron Director of Operations (DO) or Deployed
Commander (DETCO), if applicable, will actively direct the execution of the units flying
schedule. The DETCO may delegate authority to the Deployed Director of Operations
(DETDO). The aforementioned will ensure that all operations personnel provide crews with the
requisite support to plan and execute mission. They will ensure crews/mission planners have no
barriers to mission planning and ensure that every mission is thoroughly planned, briefed,
executed, and debriefed. The responsibility for mission planning is shared between the aircraft
and mission crew commanders or designated Mission Planning Cell (MPC). Together they will
ensure the JSTARS flight profile is adequately planned and the crew is properly prepared for
mission tasking and execution.
   2.1.1. Scheduling. Peacetime execution of the squadron’s flying schedule shall focus on
   accomplishment of AFI 11-2E-8 Volume 1, E-8 Aircrew Training, currency, Ready Aircrew
   Program (RAP) requirements and AFI 11-2E-8 Volume 2, Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
   2.1.2. Mission Planning, Briefing and Debriefing. Mission planning will be defined in AFI
   11-2E-8 V3, 116 ACW SUP 1. Briefings and debriefing guides can be found in the unit
   supplement. Items briefed IAW AFI 11-2E-8 V3, 116 ACW SUP 1, the applicable technical
   order, and mission standards may be briefed as ―standard‖ except on Combat Training
   Squadron (CTS) Programmed Flying Training (PFT) sorties.
   2.1.3. The Aircraft Commander (AC) will ensure the JSTARS flight profile is adequately
   planned and all flight and crew safety factors are considered. The Mission Crew Commander
   (MCC) will ensure the mission crew has the proper materials and is properly prepared for
   mission tasking and execution.

                          AIRCREW OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. General. A Pilot in Command (PIC) is designated for all flights on the flight authorization.
PICs are:
    3.1.1. Responsible for the safe accomplishment of the flight.
    3.1.2. Final authority for requesting or accepting any waivers affecting the flight.
    3.1.3. Command and Control Procedures.
       3.1.3.1. Responsibilities. The AC or designee will provide mission reports to the
       controlling C2 agency unless other guidance is directed in the OPORD or Special
       Instructions (SPINS).
       3.1.3.2. All deployment/redeployment sorties will provide status of air refueling updates
       to the home station C2 agency as soon as possible following each event.
3.2. Minimum Crew Manning.
    3.2.1. Minimum flight crew is specified as a qualified AC, Co-Pilot (CP), and Flight
    Engineer (FE). An Instructor Pilot (IP) with an Unqualified Pilot (UP), enrolled in a formal
    course of training, satisfies the two-pilot requirement.
    3.2.2. Mission Systems In-flight. The minimum crew required to initialize and operate the
    mission system is a Navigator (NAV), MCC, Sensor Officer (SO), 2x Airborne RADAR
    Technicians (ART) and 2x Communications System Technicians (CST).
       3.2.2.1. Solo ART Operations. On a case-by-case basis squadron commanders may
       authorize solo ART operations at their discretion provided all the following conditions
       are met:
           3.2.2.1.1. ART is instructor qualified.
           3.2.2.1.2. No more than a 1:3 ratio (33%) of solo ART crews OCONUS at time.

       engineer in addition to the normal flight crew. Addition of flight crewmembers after the
       first takeoff in a crew duty period is not considered augmentation.
       3.3.1.2. The operations group commander can change the augmented mission crew
       composition depending upon mission requirements Crew rest, flight duty period, and
       extensions will be IAW AFI 11-202V3 and applicable MAJCOM Supplement. Due to
       the long flights and numerous time zone changes involved in flying to and from overseas
AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                   9


      locations, ground time between landing and subsequent takeoff will not be planned for
      less than 18 hours, unless waived by OG/CC or equivalent. This ground time does not
      apply to "Op Stops" made within an aircrew duty period.
3.4. Transportation of Passengers (PAX). The AC is responsible for safe transportation and
briefing of PAX and Mission Essential Personnel (MEPs) IAW AFI 11-202V3, 11-401, Aviation
Management and MAJCOM Supplements using the Passenger Briefing Guide see Attachment
2. The AC can delegate the PAX and MEP briefing to any qualified crewmember.
   3.4.1. Crews will ensure PAX do not operate mission equipment. This does not apply to
   Professionally Qualified Civilian Employees or civilian contractors performing maintenance
   or operations IAW their contract requirements. PAX with appropriate clearances may
   observe mission activity on a non-interference basis if approved by the unit commander and
   the PIC.
   3.4.2. Transporting PAX with firearms will be conducted IAW AFI 31-207, Arming and Use
   of Force by Air Force Personnel, and DoD 5210.56.
3.5. Handling of Classified Cargo.
   3.5.1. Receipts will be obtained for classified cargo. A DD Form 1387-2, Special Handling
   Data Certification, is required for sensitive/classified cargo.
      3.5.1.1. Agencies coordinating with the aircraft commander are authorized to designate
      officer or enlisted, (E-5 and above) crewmembers on military aircraft as couriers to escort
      and safeguard courier material when other qualified personnel are not available. Qualified
      PAX, if carried, are designated prior to designating crewmembers. The following
      restrictions apply:
          3.5.1.1.1. Flight deck crewmembers will not be designated without the consent of the
          AC.
          3.5.1.1.2. Crewmembers should not be designated as couriers on aircraft scheduled to
          stop at locations that lack adequate classified storage facilities. 3.5.1.1.3. During
          scheduled or unscheduled RONs, crewmembers may place classified material in
          temporary custody of the following agencies listed in descending order of priority: (1)
          US Military classified storage facility; (2) US military guards; (3) US DoD civilian
          guards. Crewmembers will receive a hand-receipt for all classified material placed in
          temporary custody.
   3.5.2. If unable to follow the itinerary to the destination of the classified material, or if
   material is lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised, report circumstances to the nearest US
   military installation or US government activity.
   3.5.3. Crewmembers will not introduce any removable media into any media drive on the
   aircraft unless approved by the OG/CC or his designated representative. Only the ART is
   authorized to copy files to the copy man disks located on the jet which can then be retrieved
   from CSS for official use only (FOUO). The ART can request additional removable media
   for the mission via the appropriate software request form as the mission requirements dictate.
   This does not prohibit the use of the ATO/ACO updates via removable media or copying of
   End of Mission Reports to a designated medium OCONUS. The ART will ensure positive
   control and accountability of removable media until returned to the CSS.

3.6. Cargo Documentation. Proper cargo documentation must accompany each cargo load. An
OG/CC approved cargo manifest is required prior to all departures with cargo aboard. If a
computerized cargo manifest is not available, a cargo listing will accompany the load. The cargo
or mail listing may be an abbreviated manifest, but will contain all required MILSTAMP data
and information for weight and balance purposes. A Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods
is required for hazardous cargo. A DD Form 1387-2, is required for signature service cargo. The
following information should normally be obtained before shipping cargo. The final authority on
the acceptance of any cargo is the AC.
     3.6.1. Nomenclature of item. Give military or civilian name, national stock number (NSN),
     and a brief description of the item to be shipped.
     3.6.2. Dimensions (in inches): Length, width, and height.

3.7. Aircrew Flight Equipment.
     3.7.1. Designated life preservers will be readily available during all overwater flights unless
     within glide distance to land as defined by T.O. 1E-8C-1-1, Maximum Range Glide.
     3.7.2. The MCC will inventory and sign the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support
     Equipment, for all flights with mission crew members. The PIC or designee will sign the
     form when mission crew is not on board.
     3.7.3. MA-1 Portable Oxygen: During preflight, mission crew will ensure there is an
     unmodified (fast-fill) MA-1 oxygen bottle attached to each fire fighter smoke mask and each
     real world bottle team and runner position. Unmodified MA-1 oxygen bottles should be
     prioritized respectively. Missions will not be delayed or canceled if a sufficient number of
     unmodified MA-1 oxygen bottles are unavailable.
        3.7.3.1. The E-8C is equipped with 25 MA-1 oxygen bottles. If the aircraft has optional
        crew rest seats, the oxygen bottle from the galley should be moved and placed under the
        aft aisle seat. Only 25 portable oxygen bottles need be installed on the aircraft, with or
        without the optional crew rest seats.
        3.7.3.2. All portable oxygen bottles may be moved from their original position provided
        the bottles are returned to their positions as depicted in the T.O. prior to returning the
        aircraft to maintenance.
     3.7.4. Emergency Personal Oxygen System (EPOS). EPOS kits provide a tertiary source of
     oxygen in the event that system oxygen and MA-1 portable oxygen are not available during
AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    11


   an actual emergency requiring the use of supplemental oxygen. Each kit contains 16 EPOS
   units.
       3.7.4.1. Sorties with more than 30 personnel require an EPOS kit on board.
       3.7.4.2. Prior to flight, MCCs will ensure an EPOS is readily available for aircrew
       members that do not have immediate access to system oxygen or MA-1 portable oxygen
       bottles.
       3.7.4.3. EPOS will not be used during simulated emergencies drills.
3.8. Critical Phases of Flight. Critical phases of flight are defined as takeoff, air refueling,
approach, landing, emergencies and flight below 5000 feet AGL. Only aircrew performing
emergency duties are authorized to stand during critical phases of flight. Instructor Navs are
authorized to stand during air refueling operations up to pre-contact.
3.9. Portable Electronic Devices. The use of portable electronic devices will be IAW AFI 11-
202V3. Do not connect unauthorized equipment (laptop computers, video equipment, food
preparation equipment, radios/tape players, CD players, etc.) to the aircraft intercom, PA or radio
systems. Portable electronic devices may be connected to the aircraft electrical system through a
compatible (i.e. 60 Hz) outlet.
   3.9.1. Only authorized government issued computers and video replay equipment are
   authorized for use in the cockpit.
   3.9.2. Cell Phone Usage. All cell phones and similar electronic devices carried by aircrew
   will be turned off and stowed inside a closed flight bag or zipped pocket while on the flight
   line or onboard the aircraft IAW AFI 11-202V3 ACCSUP 1. The AC/MCC may
   designate/authorize a crewmember to use a cell phone for mission critical issues.
   3.9.3. Cell Phone Hazards. Cell phones will not be on within the distances listed below:
       3.9.3.1. Within 50 feet of pressurized aircraft fuel or oxygen servicing equipment.
       3.9.3.2. Within 25 feet of any aircraft fuel vent outlet during fuel transfer.
       3.9.3.3. Within 10 feet of any aircraft fuel vent outlet.
3.10. Alert Procedures.
   3.10.1. Alert procedures will be initiated by OG/CC, or higher, when mission tasking
   requires a quick response to HHQ taskings.
   3.10.2. ALPHA Alert. Aircrew is capable of launching in one (1) hour of crew notification
   of launch order. Crews should be quartered near the alert aircraft with sufficient
   transportation to get them to the aircraft in minimum time. A crew will not stay on ALPHA
   alert duty for more than 48 hours. After 48 hours, the crew must be launched, released, or
   entered into pre-departure crew rest. Crew duty day begins when the crew is notified of the
   launch order.
   3.10.3. BRAVO Alert. Aircrew is capable of launching in four (4) hours of crew notification
   of launch order. Crewmembers are given 12-hours of pre-alert crew rest. After crew rest they
   are placed on telephone standby. A crew will not stay on BRAVO alert duty for more than 48
   hours. After 48 hours, the crew must be launched, released, or entered into pre-departure
   crew rest. Crew duty day begins when the crew is alerted for duty.

                                            Chapter 4

                      FLIGHT CREW OPERATING PROCEDURES

4.1. General. This chapter contains operating procedures applicable to the flight crew. This
information is in addition to AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-401, and applicable MAJCOM supplements.
   4.1.1. Icing Conditions. Takeoff is prohibited when frost, ice, snow or slush is adhering to
   the wings, control surfaces, engine inlets, or other critical surfaces of the aircraft. Coatings
   of frost up to 1/8 inch thick on the lower wing surface, below the fuel tank area are
   permissible provided it is caused by cold soaked fuel. Cold soak fuel conditions can occur
   when an aircraft lands after having been subjected to extremely cold temperatures at altitude.
   Wing fuel may become super-cooled and will maintain skin temperature at or below freezing
   after landing even in relatively high ambient ground temperatures, causing frost to form on
   the aircraft skin. Thin coatings of frost on the fuselage are permitted provided letters and
   paint lines are visible through the frost. When in a situation requiring de-ice and anti-ice
   procedures, pilots will refer to this instruction and OGV for guidance and holdover tables.
       4.1.1.1. Critical Aircraft surfaces. Critical aircraft surfaces must be clear of adhering
       frozen contamination before beginning takeoff roll. Critical aircraft surfaces include but
       may not be limited to:
          4.1.1.1.1. Wings, slats, flaps, ailerons, spoilers.
          4.1.1.1.2. Horizontal stabilizer, elevator, vertical stabilizer, rudder.
          4.1.1.1.3. Pitot heads, static ports, ram-air intakes, engine flight instrument probes.
          4.1.1.1.4. Engine and APU inlets and exhausts, landing gear, gear doors.
          4.1.1.1.5. Radome, fuel vents
       4.1.1.2. PIC responsibility. The Pilot in Command has the ultimate responsibility for
       ensuring the aircraft is free of frozen contamination and that the flight can be operated
       safely. De-icing/Anti-icing will be accomplished IAW aircraft technical manuals,
       operational guidance, checklists and policies as specified by the unit OG. OGV will
       annually review and ensure current and standardized guidance, checklists, holdover
       tables, policies and procedures for de-icing/anti-ice procedures for the E-8C.
       4.1.1.3. De-icing is the procedure of removing frost, ice, slush, or snow from the aircraft
       in order to provide clean surfaces. On the ground this may be accomplished by any
       mechanical or pneumatic means that will not damage the aircraft or by using heated de-
       icing fluid to remove all forms of frozen contamination from critical aircraft surfaces.
       4.1.1.4. Anti-Icing is a precautionary measure that provides temporary protections
       against the formation of frost or ice and accumulation of snow or slush on treated
       surfaces of the aircraft for a limited amount of time (holdover time). Holdover time is
       calculated by the pilot after Anti-Ice fluid application and is an estimated time the applied
       fluid will prevent the formation of frozen contaminants on the treated surfaces of the
       aircraft. Anti-icing fluid is the only protection against airfoil icing prior to becoming
       airborne. Consequently, anti-icing fluid application should be completed as close to
       takeoff time as possible.
14                                                   AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009


     4.1.1.4.1. Anti-Ice Fluid Limitations. All De/Anti-icing fluids have limits to their
     operational temperature use. Approximate temperature limits for Type I fluid is -
     30C, Type II and Type IV limit is approximately -25C and Type III temperature limit
     is approx -29C. De/Anti-icing can be performed using a one or two step procedure.
        4.1.1.4.1.1. One step–De-ice and Anti-ice performed at same time with same
        fluid. Careful attention to the Type of fluid used is critical in determining
        holdover times since holdover time commences with fluid application. This
        procedure can be used to minimize time required to complete the De/Anti-Ice
        operation.
        4.1.1.4.1.2. Two Step – Two distinct fluid applications. First step is a De-ice step
        with heated fluid followed by an anti-icing fluid – usually Type II or IV but Type
        III may also be used.
     4.1.1.4.2. Anti-Ice Fluid Properties: Type 1 de-icing fluid is orange-colored to
     colorless in appearance. Type-I fluid must be mixed with water to ensure proper
     aerodynamic flow off characteristics and should never be applied at 100%
     concentration. Always conduct de-icing with an acceptable Type I fluid mixture.
     Acceptable Type I fluid mixtures are defined as; heated water - when OAT is at or
     above -3C (27F), heated water mixed with Type I, Type II, or Type III fluids, and
     heated water mixed with Type I fluid.
        4.1.1.4.2.1. Type I fluids are de-icing fluids and have no holdover times. If
        freezing rain, freezing fog, steady snow, rain or frost is accumulating on the
        aircraft after a Type I fluid application, the crew will not take off unless an Anti-
        Ice fluid (Type II, III, or IV) fluid has been applied and the associated holdover
        time has not expired OR the aircraft is de-iced again after the phenomena has
        ceased.
        4.1.1.4.2.2. Anti-Icing: Type II, Type III and Type IV are de-icing and anti-icing
        fluids are of high viscosity and are considered to be thickened fluids. Type II can
        be straw-colored to colorless in appearance while Type III is bright yellow. Type
        IV fluid is green colored except in Japan, where it is colorless. Varying
        concentrations of these fluids affect holdover times and pilots must carefully
        assess both the concentrations AND the fluid type to ensure that correct holdover
        table are used along with the correct concentrations before calculating holdover
        time.
        4.1.1.4.2.3. The AC must ensure the specification of de-ice/anti-ice fluids being
        used on the E-8C in calculating holdover times. Holdover times begin when fluid
        is first applied.
        4.1.1.4.2.4. If de-ice or anti-ice procedures are needed the AC/MCC will
        coordinate new crew show/step times if required with the Ops Super. The AC
        will ensure that applicable crewmembers and ground personnel coordinate de-
        icing activities IAW T.O. 1-E-8C-1. After de-icing only procedures and prior to
        takeoff, the AC/FE will perform a visual inspection of the critical aircraft
        surfaces.
        4.1.1.4.2.5. If any frozen precipitation (frost, snow, ice, or slush) is evident on the
AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    15


              aircraft, takeoff is not authorized until the aircraft has been de-iced again and the
              crew can comply with AFI 11-202V3 and MAJCOM guidance regarding flight in
              frozen precipitation. EXCEPTION: The T.O. 1-E-8C-1 allows a thin layer of
              hoarfrost on the fuselage.
              4.1.1.4.2.6. Snow Removal: Loose, dry snow is best removed by a Hot Air Blast
              System (HABS). Wet snow may be removed with Type I, II, or IV fluid. Use of
              ropes and brooms is not desired and should only be used as a last resort.
      4.1.1.5. Icing Restrictions. Takeoff is prohibited when frost, ice, snow or slush is
      adhering to the wings, control surfaces, engine inlets, or other critical surfaces of the
      aircraft. Critical aircraft surfaces must be clear of adhering frozen contamination before
      beginning takeoff roll.
          4.1.1.5.1. Takeoff in icing conditions beyond holdover times is prohibited. Holdover
          time begins when fluid is first applied to the aircraft. If holdover time is exceeded
          and a form of frozen phenomena is accumulating on the aircraft, a Type I fluid should
          be used to de-ice the aircraft and a Type II, III or IV fluid re-applied to establish a
          new holdover time.
          4.1.1.5.2. Do not takeoff during hail, moderate or heavy freezing rain, snow pellets
          or ice pellets regardless of De/Anti-ice fluid applications.
          4.1.1.5.3. Flight in reported severe icing conditions prohibited. Flight through
          forecast moderate or greater icing conditions will be minimized. When icing
          conditions are encountered, take immediate action to exit the icing conditions. Under
          no circumstance is sustained flight in moderate or greater icing conditions authorized.
   4.1.2. Turbulence Restrictions. Do not fly in areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence.
   Every effort will be made to avoid areas of reported moderate turbulence. If moderate
   turbulence is forecast along planned route of flight, the AC should determine the best altitude
   to avoid the moderate turbulence. If moderate or severe turbulence is encountered, the AC
   will exit the conditions using the most expeditious method possible.
   4.1.3. Thunderstorm Avoidance. Pilots will neither file a flight plan route nor fly into an
   area of known or forecast thunderstorm activity when the weather radar is inoperative or
   unusable and thunderstorm activity cannot be visually circumnavigated IAW AFI11-202V3
   criteria.
   4.1.4. Temperature Correction. Aircrews performing approaches and landings at locations
   where temperatures are 0 degrees centigrade or below will refer to the Flight Information
   Handbook, section D, Temperature Correction Chart, to establish a corrected Height Above
   Aerodrome (HAA), Height Above Touchdown (HAT), and Minimum Decent Altitude
   (MDA) as appropriate.
4.2. Pavement, Takeoff and Landing.
   4.2.1. Pavement. Runway/taxiway length and width limitations are defined by AFI11-
   202V3, ACC Sup. Crews will reference the Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Supp, Airfield
   Suitability and Restriction Report (ASRR) and the T.O. 1E-8C-1-1, Flight Manual, USAF
   Series Performance Data, E-8C Aircraft to determine the ability of the E-8C to land/taxi at
   an airfield based on planned operating weights.
16                                                        AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009


     4.2.2. Runway Length for Takeoff. Takeoffs will be initiated from the beginning of the
     approved usable portion of the runway. Minimum runway length for takeoff is critical field
     length.
     4.2.3. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are available, stressed and authorized for
     normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for takeoff. Departure
     end overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing if needed.
     4.2.4. Rolling Takeoffs. Should be made whenever critical field length permits and IAW
     T.O 1E-8C-1 and the T.O. 1E-8-C-1-1. Aircraft will normally takeoff and land on the longest
     suitable runway.
     4.2.5. Takeoff and Landing Data. All takeoff and landing data will be computed by the FE
     IAW T.O. 1E-8C-1-1. The AC, CP, or an additional FE will check the takeoff and
     emergency return data. Computerized Flight Planning Software and other programs
     approved by the OG/CC are approved for computing Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD).
        4.2.5.1. Use of Mission Accomplishment Method for calculating TOLD. Mission
        accomplishment is defined as using the benefits of headwind and slope to accomplish a
        takeoff and landing. Unless otherwise noted on the applicable chart in T.O. 1E-8C-1-1,
        crews will not use mission accomplishment methods to accomplish takeoffs or landings
        without OG/CC or equivalent approval. Operational/contingency operations may use
        mission accomplishment methods at the AC discretion, if the situation warrants.
        4.2.5.2. Mission Accomplishment Method for Obstacle Clearance will only be used IAW
        T.O. 1E-8C-1-1 and AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures.
     4.2.6. Takeoff Thrust Setting. All peacetime sorties will use reduced thrust procedures as
     described in T.O. 1E-8C-1-1. See AFI 11-2E-8, Vol 3, 116 ACW SUP 1 for conditions
     allowing Takeoff Rated Thrust (TRT) takeoffs.
     4.2.7. Tailwind. Takeoffs and landings with a tailwind are not recommended. If operational
     necessity or Air Traffic Control (ATC) considerations dictate, a tailwind takeoff or landing
     may be accepted IAW T.O. 1E-8C-1-1.
     4.2.8. RCR (Runway Condition Report). Aircraft will not takeoff or land when reported
     RCR is less than 10. The OG/CC has the authority to waive the minimum RCR to 7 when
     operational necessity warrants. Some airports may report the average RCR value, in this case
     the pilot will ask for the minimum RCR recorded on the runway. Aircrews will not conduct
     ground operations (taxi or towing) with RCR less than 7.
     4.2.9. Crosswinds. Unless further restricted by aircraft gross weight or emergency
     conditions, the following crosswind limits apply unless waived to aircraft limits by OG/CC.
        4.2.9.1. Maximum crosswind component (gust included) for takeoff or landing on a dry
        runway is 25 knots.
        4.2.9.2. Takeoff maximum crosswind on a wet runway is 20 knots.
        4.2.9.3. Landing maximum crosswind on wet runway is IAW T.O. 1E-8C-1-1.
        4.2.9.4. Maximum crosswind for touch-and-go operations is 15 knots for an IP and 10
        knots for a touch-and-go qualified AC.
AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                   17


  4.2.10. Departures. AFI 11-202V3 permits crews to depart Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and
  climb to an IFR Minimum En Route Altitude (MEA) or conduct a VFR departure to join an
  IFR flight plan as a last resort for mission accomplishment.
     4.2.10.1. The crew becomes solely responsible for air traffic separation, terrain and
     obstacle clearance, and maintaining VFR cloud clearances until rejoining their IFR flight
     plan at the IFR MEA. There is no peacetime mission that requires use of this procedure
     in lieu of being able to vertically clear all obstacles along the planned departure path with
     one engine inoperative.
     4.2.10.2. This procedure will not be used in lieu of meeting a required climb gradient
     (i.e. obstacle or ATC) without OG/CC or higher approval. This procedure will not be
     used as a means to increase fuel loads for missions.
  4.2.11. Aircraft Category. The E-8 is a category D aircraft. Some landing configurations and
  gross weight combinations will require the use of category E minimums. Refer to Flight
  Information Publication (FLIP) General Planning (GP) for guidance.
  4.2.12. Maximum Landing Gross Weight. Landing gross weight will not exceed 247,000
  pounds under normal conditions. Landing at gross weights greater than 247,000 pounds
  during an emergency is at the discretion of the AC. If mission requirements dictate, the
  OG/CC may authorize landings over 247,000 pounds, provided all other landing
  requirements can be safely met.
  4.2.13. Landings. All landings will be flown so as to touchdown in the designated
  touchdown zone (1000-2000 feet). If it appears that the actual touchdown will occur beyond
  the first 1/3 or 3,000 feet (whichever is less) of the landing runway, initiate a go-around.
     4.2.13.1. All normal full stop landings will be planned to not exceed the normal brake
     energy or landing distance limits.
     4.2.13.2. When landing on a dry runway, braking may be delayed until runway
     remaining equals computed landing distance.
     4.2.13.3. Multiple Full Stop Landings. The FE will determine the brake energy used
     during landing and then using the decision speed (V1), without headwind correction,
     determine the brake energy for an abort during a subsequent takeoff. Do not takeoff until
     the combined energy after ground cooling is less than 40 million ft-lbs. If takeoff is made
     with brake energy above 10 million ft-lbs., air-cooling procedures will be followed.
  4.2.14. Transition. Transition is defined as any approach or landing other than one to a full
  stop.
     4.2.14.1. Military, Joint Use and Civilian Airfields. IAW AFI 11-202V3 aircrew may
     conduct transition training at all military, joint use and civil (P) airfields within the
     continental United States that meet the restrictions found within this publication.
     Conducting transitions at civilian airfields requires WG/CC or higher approval and
     advanced permission from the airport manager or designated representative.
     4.2.14.2. AC’s will ensure transition is planned during ATC hours of operation and in
     compliance with Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs) and bird restrictions.
18                                                          AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009


        4.2.14.3. Flight crews should take bird strike potential into consideration when planning
        transition.
        4.2.14.4. Crews should notify the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) prior to accomplishing
        unscheduled transition.
        4.2.14.5. Seat swaps during transition should be made on the downwind leg of either the
        IFR or VFR traffic pattern.
     4.2.15. Arresting Cables (does not include recessed cables).
        4.2.15.1. Do not land on approach end arresting cables. If the aircraft lands before the
        cable, the crew should contact the tower to have the cable inspected.
        4.2.15.2. Do not takeoff or land on a runway with raised arresting gear reported as slack,
        loose or improperly rigged by NOTAM, Automated Terminal Information Service
        (ATIS), or ATC.
     4.2.16. Airfield Certification. All pilots and staff mission planners will reference the
     Airfield Qualification and Familiarization Manual as directed by AFI 11-202V3 and the ACC
     Supplement. In addition, they will review the AMC Airfield Suitability and Restrictions
     Report (ASRR) and should contact HQ AMC/A36 for updates to airfield operability and
     weight bearing capability if required. The Airfield Suitability Help Desk (DSN: 779-3112)
     can answer most airfield questions 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and can be reached via
     the internet at: https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a36a/A3AS/a3as.htm.
4.3. Airborne and Simulated Emergencies. Pilots should notify the SOF or the controlling C2
agency of any emergency or potentially hazardous situation as soon as practical. No
crewmember will use the term ―emergency‖ when communicating with external agencies, until
specifically authorized by the AC. The AC/IP will accomplish the final approach and landing
unless the situation prevents/dictates otherwise. Simulated emergency procedures practice will
be terminated. A written record of the emergency situation will be provided to the appropriate
safety office as soon as possible.
     4.3.1. Fuel Dumping. Fuel dumping will be conducted only to reduce gross weight in an
     emergency or for operational necessity. When circumstances permit, dump fuel above 5,000
     feet AGL over unpopulated areas or in designated fuel dump areas. Avoid circling descents.
     Advise the appropriate air traffic control agency of intentions, altitude, and location, when
     beginning fuel dumping and when the operation has been completed. Make the appropriate
     entry in the AFTO Form 781, Arms Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
     4.3.2. In-flight Engine Failure. If an engine is shutdown in flight, the mission may be
     terminated and a landing made as soon as practical. If the mission is continued, crews will
     notify the appropriate C2 agency.
     4.3.3. In-flight Troubleshooting. Aircrews will not conduct in-flight troubleshooting after
     tech order emergency procedures are completed. Once a malfunctioning system is isolated,
     that system should not be used again unless essential for safe recovery.
     4.3.4. Simulated Emergency Procedures. Simulated emergency procedures are flight deck
     procedures where the normal configuration of the airplane is altered (i.e., an engine pulled to
     idle to simulate the loss of an engine). All aircraft systems will be restored to normal
     operation prior to landing, except for simulated engine-out landings. Flight crew simulated
AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                     19


   emergency procedures should not be used synonymously with the simulated emergency drills
   accomplished by the mission crew.
   4.3.5. Prohibited Simulated Emergencies.
       4.3.5.1. Engine failure takeoff continued below 200AGL.
       4.3.5.2. Multiple or combined simulated emergencies.
       4.3.5.3. Three-engine rudder boost-out operations (one engine at idle and rudder boost
       off); however, three engine rudder boost out procedures may be practiced, e.g., one
       engine at idle and rudder boost on.
       4.3.5.4. Practice actual engine shutdown, except during functional check flights (FCF).
       4.3.5.5. Practice approach to stall recovery.
4.4. Diverts. The AC will ensure Airfield Ops, the SOF or the controlling C2 agency are
notified as soon as practical and request assistance coordinating transportation, security,
classified storage, and lodging, as required.
4.5. Fuel Requirements and Optimization. Flight planning and flight routes will be planned
to optimize fuel efficiency to the maximum extent possible while ensuring mission
accomplishment. Engine start times should normally occur no earlier than 30 minutes prior to
takeoff. Missions may terminate after training is completed.
   4.5.1. The AC/FE are responsible for monitoring the fuel status and updating bingo time/fuel
   as appropriate for weather and mission status.
   4.5.2. Cruise. Crews will normally fly optimum altitude/endurance speed for en-route legs
   greater than one hour, weather and ATC permitting.
   4.5.3. Orbit. Orbit speeds will maximize Fuel/Radar/Self Defense, as applicable.
   4.5.4. Missions should be planned to arrive overhead the destination/worst case alternate fix
   with no less than 15,000 pounds fuel, or in accordance with AFI 11-202V3, whichever is
   greater.
       4.5.4.1. Minimum landing fuel is 12,000 pounds. If it becomes apparent the aircraft will
       land with 12,000 pounds of fuel remaining or less, declare ―Minimum Fuel‖ and land
       short of destination; or divert as required.
       4.5.4.2. Emergency landing fuel is 10,000 pounds.
   4.5.5. Aircraft Ground Refueling. FEs must monitor ground refueling when qualified
   maintenance and or fuels personnel are not available or cannot provide assistance.
       4.5.5.1. Off-station Ground Refueling: Defense Fuel Supply Points (DFSP) located on
       military installations should to be used to procure aviation fuel to the max extent
       possible.
          4.5.5.1.1. When DFSP resources are not available use Defense Energy Support
          Center (DESC) Into-Plane contract fuel providers to the maximum extent possible.
          When using the DESC Into-Plane contract location, ensure to procure the correct
          contracted product. If the wrong product is purchased, then the unit will be charged a
          non-contract price. If a non-contract vendor is used at a contract location units will
20                                                          AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009


            be charged a non-contract price. When no DESC into-plane contract exists at a
            commercial airport location, units are authorized to purchase fuel and services from
            any commercial vendor that has a Merchant Agreement with Multi Service
            Corporation (MSC) that accepts the Air Card contract. (DESC-I-31).
            4.5.5.1.2. A list of DESC into-plane contract merchants for each contracted airport
            location can be found at: http://ports.desc.dla.mil/ip_cis/ipcis.htm. The vendors
            that have agreements with MSC can be found by searching on the ICAO at:
            https://www.airseacard.com/cgi-bin/airsea_website/fbo_locator.cgi.      Additional
            Air Card information can be found on the Fuel Card Program Management Office
            webpage at: http://www.desc.dla.mil/DCM/DCMPage.asp?pageid=614.
4.6. Occupancy of Flight Crew Duty Positions.
     4.6.1. Pilot in Command (PIC). The pilot in command will be at a set of flight controls
     during all critical phases of flight. This does not preclude a seat swap with another AC or IP
     if such is designated on the Form 4324 Flight Authorization.
        4.6.1.1. For missions with more than two qualified and current pilots, squadrons may
        designate secondary (double asterisk) PIC on the Flight Authorization. If more than one
        secondary PIC is designated, the primary PIC will determine who will act as PIC if both
        secondary PICs are occupying pilot seats at the same time.
     4.6.2. Flight below 10,000’MSL. The AC will ensure, when able, that all flight deck seats
     are manned to assist in clearing during taxi operations and flight below 10,000 feet MSL.
     4.6.3. Crew at Their Stations. Crew members will abide by AFI 11-202V3, ACC Sup
     regarding absence from their assigned duty station and occupying their duty position seats.
     During flight, if either pilot leaves the flight deck, a qualified FE, or an unqualified FE
     supervised by an instructor FE or IP, must remain on headset.
4.7. Air Refueling (AAR). ATP-56(B) provides detailed explanations of AAR procedures.
     4.7.1. Copilots (CPs) are authorized to fly the aircraft up to and including pre-contact with
     any AAR qualified pilot in the left seat. Any CP may conduct AAR under IP supervision.
     CPs may AAR under AC supervision provided both are certified and current IAW AFI 11-
     2E-8V1. Copilots will not perform autopilot off AAR without IP supervision.
     4.7.2. Override Boom Latching, or Tanker Manual Operation without tanker disconnect
     capability, will not be accomplished unless an actual fuel emergency exists. In the absence
     of mission operational directives, the OG/CC is the approval authority when a fuel
     emergency does not exist.
     4.7.3. AAR Rendezvous. The NAV will direct the rendezvous until 1 mile or when the pilots
     declare visual with the tanker. On P-sorties without a NAV, the PIC is responsible for
     accomplishing the rendezvous.
     4.7.4. AAR Overrun.
        4.7.4.1. Crews may attempt to prevent an overrun internally by slowing to no less than
        275 KIAS.
AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                   21


       4.7.4.2. If the tanker falls below the 45-degree line on the weather radar, and an overrun
       is imminent, the NAV will advise the AC. The AC will conduct the overrun IAW ATP-
       56(B).
4.8. Landing Gear and Flap Operations. Before actuation of the gear or flaps, the Pilot
Flying (PF) will call for the movement of the gear or flaps as applicable. The Pilot Not Flying
(PNF) should normally verify appropriate airspeed and acknowledge the command by repeating
it.
   4.8.1. The landing gear should normally be operated by the PNF on command of the PF.
   4.8.2. The flaps should be operated by the PNF the aircraft on command of the PF.
4.9. Aircraft Lighting.
   4.9.1. Exterior lighting will be operated IAW AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-218, Aircraft
   Operations and Movement on the Ground, and applicable T.O.s.
   4.9.2. During combat/contingency operations, the tactical situation may dictate the use of all,
   some or none of the aircraft exterior lights as determined by the AC. Lights-out operations
   during peacetime will be conducted in warning or restricted areas IAW AFI 11-202V3 unless
   a letter of agreement exists with the FAA.
   4.9.3. Aircraft Interior Lighting. During night parking, use of the overhead flight deck
   lighting should be avoided until after the aircraft is chocked.
4.10. Advisory Calls. These calls will be made when instrument procedures are being flown.
Advisory calls confirm time critical information between the PNF and the PF. Strict adherence
to advisory calls with in-depth pre-flight planning and a detailed approach briefing during low
visibility weather conditions greatly enhances crew situational awareness. In addition to the
required advisory calls depicted in Table 4.1 and Table 4.2, the PF will acknowledge all flight
parameter deviations as advised by the PNF. The NAV will back up the PNF and make advisory
calls when necessary.

    Notes for Table 4.2 and Table 4.3:
    1. If the runway environment as defined in Air Force Manual 11-217 Volume 1, Instrument Flight
    Procedures, is in sight the PNF will provide a brief description of visual cues. (i.e. ―rabbit lights,‖
    ―red termination bars,‖ ―threshold lights,‖ ―runway,‖ etc.)
    2. PF will announce his/her intentions. Intentions will be either to land, continue, or go-around.
    Decision to continue or land will be IAW procedures outlined in Air Force Manual 11-217V1.
    Above DH or prior to the VDP, no response is required unless PF has runway in sight.
    3. PF will announce his/her intentions. Intentions will be either to land or go-around. The decision
    to land from this position will be IAW procedures outlined in Air Force Manual 11-217V1 and PF
    should use extreme caution.

     4.10.1. Any flight crewmember seeing a 200 feet deviation in altitude, +15/-5 knots in
     airspeed or a potential terrain/obstruction hazard, will immediately notify the PF. Deviations
     from prescribed procedures for the approach being flown will also be announced.
     4.10.2. The NAV will announce the minimum ground speed and monitor the FMS ground
     speed throughout the approach.
     4.10.3. The engineer will callout 100’, 50’ and 20’ using the pilot’s radio altimeter for all
     landings. Any deviation from these elevation calls will be briefed during the approach
     briefing.
4.11. Radio Discipline. There is no confidentiality regarding aircraft crew communications,
recorded or otherwise. Crewmembers are expected to maintain a high degree of cockpit
professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
     4.11.1. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and
     mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, A/R, approach, landing, and any flight below
     10,000 feet MSL.
AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  23


   4.11.2. Aircraft Interphone. Flight deck crewmembers will monitor the flight deck
   interphone (FLT net) during all phases of flight. One flight crew member will monitor
   primary mission crew interphone during critical phases of flight. Navigators should monitor
   Nets 8 and the FE should monitor the IMT. All crew members should monitor the IMT/MX
   net to the maximum extent possible.
   4.11.3. Command Radios.
       4.11.3.1. The PNF normally makes all ATC radio calls.
       4.11.3.2. In terminal areas, all flight crewmembers should monitor the primary radio
       unless directed otherwise. A crewmember will be designated to monitor C2 frequencies
       on the inbound and outbound legs.
       4.11.3.3. The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and
       update the crew when the primary radio changes.
       4.11.3.4. Flight crew will monitor emergency frequencies IAW AFI 11-202V3.
       4.11.3.5. Use secure and jam resistant communications to the maximum extent possible
       in a threat environment and limit radio transmissions within the objective area to those
       required for safety of flight or factors affecting force employment.
       4.11.3.6. HF Communications. Confine message traffic to essential operational matters.
       Perform an HF radio ground check before takeoff if the use of HF radio may be required
       for ATC or C2 communications. Establish HF contact before going out of UHF and VHF
       range. If unable to establish HF contact with the controlling HF station, and an alternate
       means of relay of ATC information in oceanic areas is not available, comply with FLIP.
       4.11.3.7. 8.33 kHz Radios.        8.33 kHz radios capability is a requirement in
       EUROCONTROL airspace. Until configured for 8.33 kHz operations, pilots flying in
       European airspaces are to notify the controller that you are ―negative 8.33 equipped‖ and
       request a UHF frequency.
       4.11.3.8. Air Refueling.
           4.11.3.8.1. Prior to one mile, the NAV is normally primary on the AAR radio and
           pilots primary on ATC. Guard slice may be removed from the AAR radio.
           4.11.3.8.2. At one mile, pilots normally take control of the AAR radio.
           4.11.3.8.3. Post AAR: Radios and Nets back to normal cruise/on-station settings.
4.12. In-Flight Briefings. Takeoff, air refueling, descent, approach, touch-and-go, and full stop
briefings will be IAW the T.O. 1-E8-C-1, AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1, Instrument Flight
Procedures, and AFI11-202V3.
4.13. Aircraft Taxi, Obstruction Clearance Criteria.
   4.13.1. Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers
   monitoring clearance between aircraft and obstructions. With wing walkers, avoid taxi
   obstructions by at least 10 feet. EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 11-218, aircraft may taxi without
   marshallers/wing walkers at home station along fixed taxi lines in parking lanes which have
   been measured to ensure a minimum of 10 feet clearance from permanent obstructions.
   Aerospace Ground Equipment and vehicles are considered permanent obstructions when
24                                                         AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009


     parked in designated areas. Parked aircraft are not considered permanent, and 25 feet of
     clearance, or a wing walker, is required. The exception does not apply to obstructions within
     25 feet while taxiing outside of parking.
4.14. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential
for engine FOD. Crews should:
     4.14.1. Carefully review airfield layout paying particular attention to taxi routes, turn
     requirements, and areas for potential FOD. Pay attention to other aircraft with engines
     running on parking aprons, adjacent taxiways, hammerheads, and arm/de-arm areas.
     4.14.2. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
     4.14.3. Avoid (when possible) 180-degree turns.
     4.14.4. Avoid (when possible) taxi operations, which would position an engine over an
     unprepared or un-swept surface. If it becomes necessary to position an engine over an
     unprepared or un-swept surface, the engine should be left in idle (to the maximum extent
     possible) until the engine is back over an improved surface.
4.15. JTIDS Altitude De-confliction. Errors of up to 2000 feet can exist between the altitude
reported on JTIDS and the altitude reported by IFF. Crews must use extreme caution when using
JTIDS tracks for traffic avoidance.
4.16. Traffic Alert and Collision System (TCAS). It is imperative to follow resolution
advisories (RAs) to obtain the aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to follow the
computed RA may increase the probability of a midair collision. See Chapter 6 for TCAS
procedures.
4.17. Radio Altimeter. Set the radio altimeter dependent upon the phase of flight. For
instrument approaches, set DH or MDA as applicable. Set 2,500 for en-route cruise per T.O. -
1E-8C-1. Any crewmember detecting an unanticipated radio altimeter annunciator light will
immediately notify the pilot flying. Terrain clearance and aircraft position must be verified. An
immediate climb is warranted if uncertainty exists.
4.18. Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS). While flying instrument approaches,
follow T.O. 1-E8-C-1 guidance regarding GPWS alerts. All other GPWS alerts will be handled
as follows:
     4.18.1. For operations in day VMC conditions, with terrain and obstacles clearly in sight, the
     PF will call runway and/or terrain in sight, state intentions and visually clear terrain.
     4.18.2. For operations at night or in IMC, if the aircraft position cannot be verified,
     immediately and simultaneously establish a climb while rolling wings level, and add
     maximum power until the ―terrain‖ warning has ceased and adequate terrain clearance is
     verified. Do not delay pull-up for diagnosis of the low altitude warning. Failure to roll
     wings level during the maneuver described above will decrease stall margin and climb rates
     at heavy aircraft gross weights.
4.19. Formation. The E-8 is authorized to fly the following formation procedures:
     4.19.1. AAR formation as described in ATP-56 and T.O. 1E-8C-1.
     4.19.2. As required to accomplish assigned special missions.
AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    25


4.20. Aircraft Speed. ACs may only exceed 250 KIAS below 10,000MSL during CONUS
sorties while complying with the restrictions set forth in AFI 11-202V3. When operating
OCONUS, ACs will not exceed the speed authorizations of a foreign country unless required for
defensive procedures.
4.21. Navigation.
   4.21.1. Inertial Navigation Unit (INU). The Gyro Compass alignment is the preferred
   method of alignment for continuation training missions unless time and conditions permit an
   Enhanced Interrupted Alignment (EIA) on one or more INUs.
       4.21.1.1. EIA is an optional method of INU alignment for operational missions. A
       strong understanding of the limitations and benefits of EIA is recommended before using
       this method.
       4.21.1.2. Only one INU will be used for air alignment training. The other INU will be
       available for navigation.
   4.21.2. Oceanic Crossings. Trans-Oceanic crews will obtain current Atlantic/Pacific Route
   messages prior to flight. Deployment Planning Cell (DPC) personnel may assist with
   planning deploying/redeploying OCONUS sorties.        Crews should be familiar with
   appropriate country over flight requirements such as diplomatic clearances, ICAO radio
   procedures, etc.
       4.21.2.1. The navigator is responsible to ensure an equal time point (ETP) is calculated
       between each in-flight refueling and the destination for oceanic crossings. The ETP is a
       point along the route at which the aircraft may either proceed to the destination, first
       suitable airport, return to departure base or last suitable airport in the same amount of
       time based on all engines operating.
   4.21.3. Due Regard. ACs should be familiar with the concept of due regard and be prepared
   to declare such if necessary. Due regard is defined as operational situations that do not lend
   themselves to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) flight procedures, such as
   military contingencies, classified missions, politically sensitive missions, or certain training
   activities. Flight under ―Due Regard‖ obligates the military PIC to be his or her own air
   traffic control (ATC) agency and to separate his or her aircraft from all other air traffic. See
   FLIP General Planning, sec. 7 and AFI 11-202V3.
   4.21.4. Charts and Data.
       4.21.4.1. Navigational charts will be annotated IAW AFI 11-202V3, MAJCOM
       Supplements and T.O. 1-E-8C-1.
       4.21.4.2. If an appropriate FLIP document is not available, NAVs will use a terrain chart
       to monitor the aircraft position and ensure terrain clearance during departures and
       arrivals. The terrain chart should be an ONC or larger scale chart and available at the
       NAV station. Crews will not use terrain charts to build their own obstacle clearance
       departures.
       4.21.4.3. Crews should ensure the PCMCIA data card is current for every flight.
       PCMCIA cards will be removed prior to any mission system being zeroized to prevent
       inadvertently deleting the data. If the data card is not current, the flight may continue
26                                                       AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009


        provided all waypoint coordinates are cross-referenced to current FLIP products or CFPS
        products that were prepared using current DAFIF.
     4.21.5. Position checks will be made as required to comply with RNP and RNAV
     requirements listed below.
     4.21.6. The NAV will track all in-flight clearances and maintain a flight log IAW AFI11-
     202V3, MAJCOM Sup.
     4.21.7. RNAV, RVSM and RNP Airspace. All E-8s are certified for Area Navigation
     (RNAV) Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) and Required Navigational
     Performance (RNP) airspace
     4.21.8. RNP-10/BRNAV Equipment Updates.
        4.21.8.1. Mission Planning. Crews will check the appropriate NOTAM and FLIP
        products to determine airspace and filing requirements. Crews will plan appropriate
        update points along the route of flight to extend the RNP/BRNAV time limit for an
        additional 7.5 hours.
        4.21.8.2. Updates. Crews will update both INU’s while in ground NAVAID coverage
        prior to oceanic crossing to re-hack the 7.5 hour RNP/BRNAV time limit. Another
        update will occur once within ground NAVAID coverage after oceanic crossing.
        Additionally, update the INU before the position drifts five miles from the actual
        position.
        4.21.8.3. Contingencies. Crews will notify ATC any time the instruments required in the
        MEL for RNP/BRNAV airspace are lost, and coordinate a new clearance if required.
     4.21.9. Required Navigation Performance (RNP Airspace). Airspace where RNP is applied
     is considered special qualification airspace. The E-8 is approved for operation in RNP
     airspace with operational limitations based on navigational equipment.
        4.21.9.1. RNP-10 compliance includes navigation accuracy within 10 NM of actual
        position 95 percent of the time. The E-8 may operate in RNP-10 airspace when the
        following conditions are met:
            4.21.9.1.1. The ―INU-only‖ navigation mode is selected for the steering solution.
            Other Navigation Modes may not be used for operations in RNP-10 airspace.
            4.21.9.1.2. Updates will be IAW RNP/BRNAV update and contingency procedures
            in this volume.
     4.21.10. Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) and RNP-5 Airspace. Compliance includes
     navigation accuracy within 5NM of actual position 95 percent of the time. BRNAV
     navigation accuracy criteria is RNP-5. Aircraft may operate in BRNAV/RNP-5 airspace
     when the following conditions are met:
        4.21.10.1. The ―INU-only‖ or the INU with manual in-flight updating or point to point
        navigation using the flight management system (FMS) shall be the only navigation modes
        used for operations in BRNAV airspace.
        4.21.10.2. Should NAVAIDS become unavailable, either through radio failure or denial,
        the ―INU-only‖ solution cannot be used longer than 7.5 hours from the time the INUs
AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  27


     were commanded to the NAV mode or the last update, whichever is later. Refer to RNP-
     10/BRNAV Update and Contingency Procedures in this volume.
     4.21.10.3. Updates will be IAW RNP/BRNAV update and contingency procedures in
     this volume.
  4.21.11. RNP-10/BRNAV Update and Contingency Procedures.
     4.21.11.1. Aircraft must exit RNP-10/BRNAV airspace 7.5 hours after the INU systems
     were placed in NAV mode after either a full gyrocompass ground alignment or an in-
     flight update.
     4.21.11.2. An in-flight update may be conducted on one INU at a time within coverage
     of an FAA/CAA approved radio-NAVAID.
     4.21.11.3. The resulting update must provide a position that agrees with the position
     provided by the radio-NAVAID plus or minus 0.3 NM.
     4.21.11.4. After the first INU successfully completes an in-flight update and its position
     accuracy is verified, the second INU may be updated and its position compared to the
     first INU, or the radio-NAVAID.
  4.21.12. RNP/BRNAV Flight Planning. The PIC will review airspace requirements (i.e.
  specific RNP level and contingency actions, etc), verify the aircraft is approved for
  RNP/BRNAV operation, and assess mission impact when flying in RNP-10/BRNAV
  airspace.
     4.21.12.1. En-route. Both INUs must be operational at the RNP-10/BRNAV entry point.
     Periodic crosschecks will be accomplished to identify navigation errors and prevent
     inadvertent deviation from ATC cleared routes. Advise ATC of the deterioration or
     failure of navigation equipment below navigation performance requirements and
     coordinate appropriate actions.
  4.21.13. Post Flight. Document malfunctions or failures of RNP/BRNAV required
  equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet RNP/BRNAV tolerances, in an
  AFTO Form 781.
  4.21.14. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM
  is applied is considered special qualification airspace. Both the aircrew and the specific
  aircraft must be approved for operations in these areas. IRC currency establishes IRC
  certification for E-8C aircrew. All E-8’s are approved for unrestricted use in the full RVSM
  envelope. Refer to FLIP GP and the following guidance for RVSM requirements:
  4.21.15. RVSM Equipment. Primary altimeters, the autopilot (to include the altitude hold
  function), the altitude alerter, and the IFF transponder must be fully operational before entry
  into RVSM airspace. Should any of this equipment fail before entering RVSM airspace,
  request a new clearance so as to avoid this airspace.
     4.21.15.1. Autopilot. The autopilot shall be engaged during level cruise except when
     circumstances such as the need to re-trim the aircraft or turbulence procedures require
     disengagement.
28                                                         AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009


        4.21.15.2. Altimeters.    Crosscheck the altimeters (STBY to RESET) before or
        immediately upon entry to RVSM airspace. The PIC will ensure that readings of all
        altimeters are recorded and retained for use in contingency situations.
        4.21.15.3. Should any of the required equipment fail after entry into RVSM airspace,
        immediately notify ATC and coordinate a plan of action.
     4.21.16. RVSM Operations. Continuously monitor systems and crosscheck altimeters to
     ensure they agree ± 200 ft. Aircrews should limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 feet per
     minute when operating in the vicinity of other aircraft to reduce potential effects on TCAS
     operations.
     4.21.17. Post Flight. Document malfunctions or failures of RVSM required equipment in the
     AFTO Form 781, including the failure of equipment to meet RVSM tolerances.
4.22. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are
centralized base efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
consolidated course of action. BASH programs are developed and executed by host base Safety
and Bio-environmental offices and approved by host base commanders. Some airfields, i.e.
Army, do not have BASH programs and will not set a Bird Watch Condition (BWC), requiring
crews to use all available resources to determine local bird conditions
     4.22.1. Mission Planning: ACs will reference the Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS)
     website (http://www.usahas.com) within 24 hours of mission execution to determine
     forecast bird strike potential at takeoff, transition and landing bases for ORM purposes.
     4.22.2. Flight: The AC will obtain the airfield’s actual BWC from ATIS, tower, SOF,
     airfield operations or pilot assessment. Crews may request an AHAS update within an hour
     of proposed takeoff or landing via C2 agencies to get live data with trend information.
     Aircrews will comply with the following restrictions:
        4.22.2.1. BWC Low – No operating restrictions.
        4.22.2.2. BWC Moderate. Initial takeoffs and final landings are authorized only if the
        departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Flight crews should consult with the
        SOF prior to landing or departing. Continuation training is restricted to low approaches
        at or above 2,000 AGL. VFR traffic patterns and IFR circling approaches are prohibited.
        4.22.2.3. BWC Severe (BWCS). All takeoffs and landings are prohibited. Waiver
        authority is local OG/CC or SOF.
        4.22.2.4. This does not prohibit an AC from requesting a single takeoff for the purpose
        of departing the local area after an unexpected ground delay that pushed the takeoff into
        the automatic BWCS or from performing a single approach to a full stop during BWCS
        when birds do not appear to be a factor. In this situation the AC may request a waiver
        from the SOF for a one time takeoff or full stop. The SOF will visually assess the
        situation and approve or disapprove the request based on actual observed conditions on
        the airfield and in the arrival/departure corridor.
        4.22.2.5. If the SOF authorizes a waiver to takeoff, the AC will depart using the noise
        abatement procedure in the T.O. 1E-8C-1, Chapter 2 with a climb at Vco+10 to 3000’
        AGL or the altitude assigned by ATC, whichever is lower, before lowering the nose and
        accelerating.
AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                   29


      4.22.2.6. If the SOF authorizes a waiver for a full stop, the AC will fly an ILS or a visual
      approach using the best available glide path guidance. If a non-precision approach is
      required due to the inability to fly an ILS or visual approach, the AC will limit the time
      spent flying at or below MDA by planning a constant rate descent to arrive at the MDA
      at, or just prior to, the VDP. If a circling approach is required, the AC will fly the
      circling maneuver at the highest possible altitude up to VFR pattern altitude and limit
      time spent flying at the circling MDA.
      4.22.2.7. The AC is the final authority regarding the conduct of a full stop landing during
      bird watch condition severe if the recovery is necessitated by an in-flight emergency.
      Time permitting, the SOF should provide an advisory call to the emergency aircraft
      regarding the actual bird conditions being observed at the airfield.
      4.22.2.8. All waivers for a single takeoff or full stop landing at Robins AFB during
      BWCS will be documented in both the daily SOF log and the Wing Operations Center
      Daily Log.
   4.22.3. ACs are the final authority and may delay takeoffs and arrivals due to BWC.
   Coordinate delays through appropriate C2 authority.
   4.22.4. Following a bird/wildlife strike, pilots should land as soon as practical, record the
   bird strike in the AFTO 781, and complete and turn in to maintenance debrief both sides of
   116 ACW Form 5. If the landing is off station, turn in the Form 5 to the local Safety office
   (if available) and maintenance debrief /116 ACW Safety office upon return to Robins.
4.23. Functional Check Flights (FCFs) and In-flight Operational Check Flights
(IFOCs). FCFs and IFOCs will be accomplished IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment
Maintenance Management, and the OG supplement.
   4.23.1. Requirements. An OCF is designed to check mission equipment/software builds and
   will be performed upon request, normally when:
      4.23.1.1. Aircraft are returned following depot modifications and/or C checks.
      4.23.1.2. The first flight after a software release.
      4.23.1.3. The 116 AMXS determines an OCF should be performed due to extensive
      PME maintenance.
   4.23.2. Scheduling. Specific scheduling responsibilities are as follows:
      4.23.2.1. The requestor of the OCF (normally CSS, MXS, or XP) will identify applicable
      areas of the master OCF checklist (found on the OGV web page). The requestor will
      deliver the ―modified‖ OCF checklist to OSS schedulers during the applicable scheduling
      meeting. OSS and MXG schedulers will negotiate the date, time, and requirements for
      the OCF. The OSS will then task and deliver the modified checklist to the assigned
      squadron scheduler NLT 5 duty days prior to the OCF.
      4.23.2.2. CSS, Det 2 and/or Northrop Grumman will supply OSS the full name, rank,
      social security number and security clearance information on non-116 ACW personnel
      requesting to fly on the OCF sortie.
30                                                             AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009


     4.23.3. Crew Manning. The SQ/DO will determine the crew manning as required. The
     MCC is responsible for acquiring the applicable OCF checklist from the SQ/DO. The MCC
     will ensure all necessary checklists are completed, and write an OCF report.
     4.23.4. Software OCF. CSS will provide information to the SQ/DO or MCC on specific
     Deficiency Reports (DR) included in the new software version. The MCC will ensure the
     corrections for these DRs are tested for operational suitability. Some can be verified during
     ground test, but others will require flight test. The OCF report will specifically list passed
     and failed Discrepancy Reports (DRs) along with reasons for any failures.
     4.23.5. Reports. Crewmembers will provide all relevant findings to the MCC. After an
     OCF is completed, the MCC will send an after action report to OGV and MXG/QA. OGV
     will forward discrepancies to OG/CC.
4.24. Participation in Aerial Events. See AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures,
and the appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Aerial events must be sanctioned and approved by
the appropriate military authority and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
4.25. Aircraft Security. The E-8 is designated a security priority Protection Level 2, or
equivalent resource. The AC is responsible for ensuring aircraft security is provided at the
destination and any en-route stops. Guidance can be found on aircraft security and preventing
and resisting aircraft piracy (hijacking) of E-8 aircraft in AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting
Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking), AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, FAA
NOTICE 7110.422 and other specific MAJCOM security publications. Aircrews will not
release information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or
missions to the public.
4.26. Suspected Laser Response/Exposer. When encountering laser illumination, aircrew
should not stare at the laser source, but transition to aircraft instruments and turn away from the
threat. Aircrews should recognize the laser may be associated with a weapon posing a greater
threat and initiate appropriate evasive action. If a laser threat exists in vicinity of an airfield of
intended arrival or departure, ALEP devices should be donned prior to descent from cruise
altitude, or prior to takeoff, as applicable. Doffing of ALEP devices after departing a defined
laser threat area or after landing is left to discretion of the aircraft commander. The following
procedures should be implemented immediately following suspected laser exposure.
     4.26.1. Look away from laser source; do not remove ALEP devices.
     4.26.2. Transition to aircraft instruments.
     4.26.3. If exposed pilot is flying the aircraft, transfer control to unaffected pilot.
     4.26.4. Assess visual functionality. If visual disturbance persists for more than 60 seconds,
     declare in-flight emergency and return to base as soon as practical.
     4.26.5. Notify command and control agency of suspected laser incident.
     4.26.6. Avoid rubbing eyes.
     4.26.7. If vision returns to normal and there is no pain within 3-5 minutes, the AC will
     consider the value of continuing the mission against potential loss of an aircrew member who
     may have sustained eye damage. The AC will determine whether or not to return to base.
AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                            31


  4.26.8. Upon return to base, accomplish intelligence debrief and report suspected laser
  exposure incidents IAW procedures outlined in AFI 11-301 Volume 4, Aircrew Laser Eye
  Protection (ALEP).
  4.26.9. Aircrew who suspect exposure to laser radiation from either friendly or hostile
  sources should report to Flight Surgeon’s Office or nearest emergency room where they can
  be examined by an ophthalmologist immediately upon landing.

                                           Chapter 6

    CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH YIELD
                   EXPLOSIVE (CBRNE) OPERATIONS

6.1. General Information. Potential adversary use of CBRNE weapons against a friendly
airfield presents a serious threat to flying operations. Although the most effective way for
aircrews to avoid this threat is to be airborne before those weapons are detonated or dispersed
and then land at a field that has not been contaminated, all personnel must be prepared to operate
from a field that has come under CBRNE attack.
6.2. Mission Preparation. Be aware of the status of the CBRNE environment at the planned
launch and recovery airfields, potential divert bases, and throughout the area in which the sortie
may fly. Know the current and forecast surface wind direction and the MOPP level in effect for
relevant sectors of the airfield. Don appropriate aircrew chemical defense equipment (ACDE) or
Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) to match the appropriate MOPP level (reference AFMAN 10-
100, Airman’s Manual) and carry individual protective equipment (IPE) as required.
6.3. Stepping to Fly and Aircraft Preflight. This may entail donning ACDE or transitioning
from GCE to ACDE. Take precautions to protect aircrew from injury and or contamination
while in transit from the squadron facility to the aircraft. If possible, transport aircrew in a
vehicle that provides overhead cover (enclosed vehicle). If aircrew travel on foot is unavoidable,
choose a route that takes maximum advantage of available overhead cover (sun shades,
buildings, etc.) to avoid agents that may be settling from the air. If extra aircrew members are
available for preflight duties, consider assigning them to do so wearing GCE. This will allow the
aircrew actually flying to minimize exposure.
   6.3.1. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) Prior to Engine Start. If Alarm Red occurs during
   the step or preflight process, take cover and don appropriate MOPP. This may require use of
   the ground crew mask. A hardened aircraft shelter (HAS) provides optimum protection, if
   available. Use caution if entering a HAS that contains aircraft and/or equipment. Close doors
   after entry. If a HAS or other overhead cover is not immediately available, accept the best
   rapidly reachable cover.
6.4. Engine Start to Takeoff. If a HAS is available, use it to minimize exposure time by
accomplishing aircraft pre-flight and engine start procedures inside it (if local procedures
permit) and by delaying taxi time as long as possible prior to takeoff.
   6.4.1. Aircraft Launch to Survive (LTS). Units will develop local procedures to provide this
   option to the commander. In general, aircraft may LTS any time after engine start if they
   have sufficient fuel and safe, expeditious access to a runway. This option may only be
   practical for aircraft that are near EOR prior to takeoff or that have just landed.
   6.4.2. Alarm Red Prior to Taxi. If in a HAS, the normal procedure is to shut down. Engine
   noise may preclude effectiveness of normal alert notification procedures, so ensure ground
   personnel are aware of the alarm warning, assume proper MOPP, and close HAS doors. Use
   hand signals if necessary.
   6.4.3. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) After Taxi. Units typically establish procedures
   for this contingency depending on whether additional protection is available along the taxi
36                                                           AFI11-2E-8V3 8 DECEMBER 2009


     route (empty HAS, for instance). Ideally, ground crew sheltering in such a HAS would be
     available to assist in normal engine shutdown procedures and to close HAS doors. If
     protection is not available, the best option may be LTS. Maintain contact with Command
     and Control (C2) entities (Wing Operations Center, Maintenance Operations Center,
     Supervisor of Flying, etc.) to ensure unity of effort in the overall plan.
6.5. Takeoff to Landing.
     6.5.1. Contamination. If Chemical Warfare (CW) agent contamination has occurred prior to
     takeoff, then flying the aircraft will dissipate the agent to some degree. The total amount of
     dissipation will be greater with lower flight altitudes and longer flight times. Because the
     agent may have entered wheel wells, flaps, etc., consider flying in landing configuration to
     increase airflow to these areas. In any circumstances, merely flying the aircraft is unlikely to
     achieve complete decontamination.
     6.5.2. Preparing to Land. Aircrew should remain aware of the status of primary and
     alternate landing locations. Do not attempt to land during Alarm Red situations unless there
     is no other option. Follow C2 directions and either hold or divert. If mission needs preclude
     divert, hold until the Alarm Red (or theater equivalent) has cleared or become an Alarm
     Black. Prior to landing, gain awareness of contaminated sectors of the airfield and of
     current/forecast surface winds. Use this information in conjunction with C2 direction to plan
     a route from landing to engine shutdown. The liquid deposition phase following a CW
     airburst attack can extend up to 1 hour. If landing during Alarm Black, expect a
     contaminated environment and MOPP 4.
6.6. Landing to Engine Shutdown. Take advantage of any protection available, minimizing
taxi time and distance. Maintain contact with C2 in order to remain aware of unexploded
ordnance and/or damage to airfield movement surfaces. If a HAS is available and local
procedures permit, accomplish engine shut-down and post-flight procedures there. If Alarm Red
(or Theater Equivalent) occurs between landing and engine shutdown, considerations are similar
to those discussed in the engine-start-to-takeoff section.
6.7. After Engine Shutdown. Don appropriate MOPP if not already worn. If circumstances
permit, accomplish normal post-flight inspection procedures. If the aircraft is not contaminated,
close doors, hatches, and windows. If there is any suspicion of personnel contamination, aircrew
will process through an aircrew contamination control area (ACCA). Accomplish maintenance
debriefings under cover to the maximum extent possible.
