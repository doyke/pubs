                                              Chapter 1

                                   GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope. This instruction outlines the procedures applicable to the safe operation of
sailplanes, including the TG-10, TG-15, and any other sailplane acquired to conduct AF-
approved sailplane flying programs. Along with the complementary references cited, this
instruction prescribes standard operational procedures to be used by all pilots operating
sailplanes. Units will provide local operating procedures in a supplement to this publication.
1.2. Pilot’s Responsibility. In conjunction with other governing directives, this instruction
prescribes sailplane procedures under most circumstances, but is not to be used as a substitute for
sound judgment or common sense. The pilot in command (PIC) is ultimately responsible for the
safe and effective operation of the aircraft and will ensure all occupants of the aircraft comply
with this directive.
1.3. Deviations. Do not deviate from the procedures and guidance in this publication except
when necessary to preserve safety or protect lives. In that case, the PIC has ultimate authority
and responsibility for the course of action to be taken and will take the appropriate action to
safely recover the aircraft. Report all deviations without waiver through channels to the
MAJCOM OPR.
1.4. References. The primary references for sailplane operations are this instruction and
technical orders (TO) 1G-10(T)-1, Flight Manual--USAF Series, TG-10B/C Sailplanes, or TO
1G-15(T)-1, Flight Manual--USAF Series, TG-15A/B Aircraft.
     1.4.1. For sailplane assembly and disassembly, use the appropriate flight manual or the
     current version of the applicable sailplane assembly and disassembly checklist published by
     HQ AETC/A3FV (available at: https://www-r.aetc.af.mil/do/dof/download.asp).
     1.4.2. Training units may develop phase manuals from the procedures contained in these
     documents. Phase manuals may be used to augment initial and mission qualification training.
     They may expand these basic procedures, but will not be less restrictive. Only maneuvers
     described in these references will be flown.
1.5. Recommended Changes and Waivers. Except where noted herein, the MAJCOM A3 is
the waiver authority for this instruction. Submit waiver requests in message or memorandum
format.
1.6. Crew Requirements. The minimum crew for all sailplanes is one pilot qualified IAW AFI
11-2SAILPLANE, Volume 1, Sailplane Aircrew Training.
1.7. Maximum Flight Duty Period Flight Time. AFI 11-202, Volume 3, lists maximum flight
duty periods.
     1.7.1. Units will consider sailplanes as “trainer” type aircraft.
     1.7.2. Use of additional crewmembers to extend the flight duty period (augmented crew) is
     not authorized.
AFI11-2SAILPLANEV3 2 FEBRUARY 2011                                                            5


1.8. Clothing Requirements. All aircrew members will wear flight suits and flight boots, or
other MAJCOM- or installation-approved uniforms while operating the aircraft. Passengers may
wear any uniform combination or appropriate civilian attire.
   1.8.1. Aircrew members will carry appropriate seasonal flight clothing.
   1.8.2. Aircrew members will remove rings and scarves before performing aircrew duties.
   1.8.3. Parachutes must be worn for all spin, aerobatic, cross-country, and planned wave
   flights.
1.9. Seatbelts and Shoulder Harnesses. All occupants will wear seatbelt and shoulder
harnesses at all times while operating the aircraft.
1.10. Oxygen Requirements. The PIC will ensure oxygen is used IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3,
and the aircraft flight manual. Units will ensure only certified personnel service oxygen
equipment. When oxygen is required, the minimum oxygen pressure is 50 pounds per square
inch. Pilots on oxygen will perform a pressure, regulator, indicator, connections, and emergency
(PRICE) check every 30 minutes.
1.11. Cargo Restrictions. None.
1.12. Interfly. Interfly is defined in AFI 11-401, Aviation Management. Interfly requires
approval of both operations group commanders and notification of the appropriate numbered Air
Force (NAF) and MAJCOM standardization and evaluation office.
1.13. Aerial Events. Units will conduct aerial events IAW AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and
Procedures, and AFI 11-246, Volume 7, Air Force Aircraft Demonstrations (Sailplanes).

                                             Chapter 2

                                         MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. The individual pilots and the operations functions of the organizations
jointly share responsibility of mission planning. The PIC is ultimately responsible for mission
planning.
2.2. General Procedures. The pilots will:
     2.2.1. Accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission accomplishment. AFI 11-
     202, Volume 3, and this instruction specify minimum requirements.
     2.2.2. Compute weight and balance for each flight. MAJCOM-approved tabulated data may
     be used when available.
     2.2.3. Ensure all passengers are manifested IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
2.3. Briefings and Debriefings. The PIC is responsible for presenting a logical briefing that
will promote safe, effective mission accomplishment. All pilots will attend the flight briefing and
debriefing. The PIC will structure the flight briefing to accommodate the capabilities of each
pilot. On subsequent flights during the same day with the same crew, the PIC must brief only
those items that have changed from the previous flights. Passengers will be briefed on their
specific responsibilities related to safe mission accomplishment.
     2.3.1. Briefing Guides:
        2.3.1.1. All missions will be briefed and debriefed, using the applicable briefing guide as
        a reference (Attachment 2 and Attachment 3). Note: Briefing guides are reference lists of
        items that may apply to particular missions.
        2.3.1.2. Items listed may be briefed in any sequence. Those items covered by phase
        manuals or written squadron standards, and understood by all participants may be briefed
        as "standard." Each guide may be expanded as necessary to cover other important items
        of the flight. Brief only those items applicable to the particular mission and in sufficient
        detail to prevent any misunderstanding between crewmembers.
     2.3.2. Alternate Missions:
        2.3.2.1. Pilots will brief an alternate mission profile for each flight. Solo students will not
        deviate from the briefed primary or alternate mission profile. Exception: If the primary
        mission is a pattern tow, an alternate mission profile is not required.
        2.3.2.2. The alternate mission will be less complex than the primary mission. Missions or
        events not briefed will not be flown. Mission elements or events may be briefed airborne
        if it is practical to do so and flight safety is not compromised.
2.4. Maps and Charts. When flying outside the local area, appropriate charts covering the
route of flight must be on board the aircraft.
2.5. Required Documents. The following documents must be on board for flight:
     2.5.1. Aircraft weight and balance report.
     2.5.2. Airworthiness certificate.
AFI11-2SAILPLANEV3 2 FEBRUARY 2011                                                             7

   2.5.6. A unit-developed pilot aid according to paragraph 2.6.2 of this instruction.
2.6. Unit-Developed Checklists and Pilot Aids:
   2.6.1. When aircrew use unit-developed checklists in lieu of flight manual checklists
   (according to AFI 11-215), the checklists must contain, as a minimum, all items (verbatim
   and in order) listed in the applicable flight manual checklist. Crewmembers will still carry a
   current flight manual checklist (paragraph 2.5.5) and have it immediately available on all
   flights.
   2.6.2. Unit-developed pilot aids will include, as a minimum, the following items:
      2.6.2.1. Briefing guides.
      2.6.2.2. Local radio frequencies.
      2.6.2.3. Appropriate airfield diagrams, including aircraft arresting systems.
      2.6.2.4. Emergency information, including impoundment procedures, emergency action

                           NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Preflight:
     3.1.1. Required Equipment. Chapter 4 specifies the minimum equipment required for
     flight.
     3.1.2. Aircraft Systems. Students will not fly solo in aircraft requiring an operational
     check. With operations supervisor approval, pilots may perform operational checks during
     dual-student training sorties if the checks do not interfere with training objectives.
     3.1.3. Ballast Operations. Pilots will:
        3.1.3.1. Only load ballast according to the aircraft flight manual.
        3.1.3.2. Not use parachutes for ballast unless the personnel with the parachute have been
        trained according to AFI 11-301, Volume 1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program.
     3.1.4. Foreign Object Damage (FOD). To reduce the risk of FOD and personal injury,
     personnel will ensure loose items are secured in the cockpit at all times.
     3.1.5. Assembly and Disassembly:
        3.1.5.1. Assembly and disassembly of aircraft will only be performed by trained
        crewmembers.
        3.1.5.2. After a sailplane is reassembled, a certified rated officer or civilian coach not
        involved in the aircraft assembly will sign off the “Corrected by” block in the AFTO
        Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. Qualified maintenance
        personnel must then inspect the sailplane prior to flight. (Exception: When maintenance
        personnel are not available, an IP qualified in the aircraft's assembly/disassembly may
        inspect the aircraft.) The individual who performed the inspection will sign off the red X
        and the “Inspected by” block in the AFTO Form 781A.
     3.1.6. Preflight Inspections:
        3.1.6.1. The PIC is responsible for ensuring the AFTO 781-series forms are reviewed
        prior to flight.
        3.1.6.2. Pilots or maintenance personnel discovering a nonairworthy condition will
        immediately install a red tag on the aircraft control stick and ensure the aircraft AFTO
        Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance, is updated to reflect a red
        X status. Units will make red tags available in the AFTO 781-series forms. Only
        authorized maintenance personnel will remove the tag when repairs are complete and the
        aircraft is released for flight.
3.2. Ground Operations:
     3.2.1. Ground Handling:
        3.2.1.1. Ground handlers will maintain 10 feet of nose-to-tail separation between
        sailplanes. (Exception: Less than 10 feet of nose-to-tail separation between sailplanes is
        authorized when sailplanes are staged for a cross-country launch grid. If sailplanes are
AFI11-2SAILPLANEV3 2 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                 9


     staged for a cross-country launch grid, ground handlers will remove the tail wheel
     dollies.)
     3.2.1.2. Unless a sailplane is in the takeoff position, airbrakes will be open or unlocked
     and the upwind wing will be manned.
     3.2.1.3. Do not stand in front of any part of a sailplane hooked up for launch.
     3.2.1.4. Do not ground handle or move aircraft so as to overlap wings and/or fuselages
     unless hangaring the aircraft (paragraph 3.2.3).
     3.2.1.5. Personnel will ensure draglines used for towing are at least as long as one half
     the wingspan of the sailplane.
     3.2.1.6. Ideally, use three or more people (two minimum) to ground handle sailplanes.
     Normally position one person on the upwind wing tip, and one person either at the
     opposite wing root or at the aircraft tail. When three people are available, position the
     third person in the cockpit, at the other wing root, or at the aircraft tail.
     3.2.1.7. Close and secure the canopy when the cockpit is not occupied, unless the canopy
     is being guarded.
     3.2.1.8. Never leave a sailplane unattended unless it is secured.
     3.2.1.9. Tie down sailplanes IAW local directives and the flight manual, normally facing
     into the wind. When tying down any sailplane overnight, ground handlers will attach both
     wings and the tail to established tiedown equipment. For the TG-15, use wing cuffs and a
     main wheel strap (if a main wheel ground tiedown is available). To prevent damage to
     the TG-15 fuselage, use a tail dolly or additional padding to secure the tail.
  3.2.2. High Wind Procedures. Units will ensure there are adequate personnel on the flight
  line to safely ground handle all sailplanes during high winds (over 25 knots). Ground
  handlers will increase nose to tail separation (minimum one half the wingspan) of aircraft on
  the flight line during high wind conditions. If practical, turn the aircraft into the wind, place a
  crewmember in the cockpit, and ensure the airbrakes are open to prevent aircraft damage.
     3.2.2.1. When winds exceed 25 knots, a minimum of three people are required to move
     each sailplane. A minimum of two people are required while the aircraft is static.
     3.2.2.2. When winds exceed 30 knots, all sailplanes will remain tied down or be
     hangared. Units will use good judgment and use as many people as possible (a minimum
     of four) to move sailplanes. After landing, aircrews should remain in the cockpits with
     the radio on, the airbrakes out, and the stick aft until assistance arrives. If available,
     ground handlers may place weights in front cockpits, holding the stick aft while towing
     the sailplane behind a vehicle.
  3.2.2.3. When temporarily tying down sailplanes due to inclement weather, as a minimum,
  ground handlers will:
         3.2.2.3.1. Attach mooring rings to established tie down equipment (TG-10).
         3.2.2.3.2. Remove the wingtips, route the tie down rope through the wingtip pin, and
         reconnect the wingtip to the sailplane (TG-15).
  3.2.3. Hangaring:
 10                                             AFI11-2SAILPLANEV3 2 FEBRUARY 2011


      3.2.3.1. Units will use a minimum of two people with one certified person to hangar
      sailplanes.
      3.2.3.2. Ground handlers will install main wheel dollies by pushing the sailplane onto the
      dolly with the wings level and installing the stop bar.
      3.2.3.3. After hangaring, airbrakes will remain unlocked and canopies will be closed and
      locked (covered as necessary).
      3.2.3.4. Units may publish local sailplane hangaring procedures.
   3.2.4. Additional Flight Line Duties. Units will define additional flight line duties to
   support sailplane operations.
3.3. Takeoff and Landing:
   3.3.1. Minimum Runway:
      3.3.1.1. The minimum landing surface is determined by the spacing requirements in
      paragraph 3.3.4.
      3.3.1.2. Units will publish procedures to limit operations when takeoff runways or
      landing surfaces are other than dry, or when a hard surface landing is required.
      3.3.1.3. Units will publish approval procedures for flights to or from other than
      established landing surfaces.
   3.3.2. Minimum Aerotow Rate of Climb. Units will publish procedures to limit operations
   when density altitude exceeds 10,000 feet. All tow operations will cease when a minimum
   altitude of 200 feet above ground level (AGL) cannot be achieved by 1 nautical mile (NM)
   from the departure end of the runway.
   3.3.3. Wind Limitations:
      3.3.3.1. Pilots will use the full gust factor and maximum crosswind angle of variable
      winds to determine if winds exceed aircraft or pilot limits for takeoff. If the crosswind
      component (including gusts) exceeds flight manual limits, pilots will consider changing
      the landing direction and land into the wind, if possible.
      3.3.3.2. The maximum crosswind limit for takeoff and landing are defined in the flight
      manual.
      3.3.3.3. The maximum crosswind limit for an initial solo’s takeoff and landing is 10
      knots.
   3.3.4. Minimum Spacing. Pilots will:
      3.3.4.1. Comply with the sailplane reduced same runway minimums defined in
      MAJCOM supplements to AFI 13-204, Volume 3, Airfield Operations Procedures and
      Programs.
      3.3.4.2. Land the aircraft so as to maintain at least one full wingspan of lateral separation
      from sailplanes or obstacles during landing and rollout.
      3.3.4.3. Stop the aircraft no less than 200 feet behind other aircraft, obstacle, or
      personnel. Note: A tow rope is not considered an obstacle, but pilots will avoid rolling
      over the assembly hardware.
AFI11-2SAILPLANEV3 2 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                11


       3.3.4.4. For landings on the same runway behind other than sailplanes, not plan to cross
       the runway threshold until preceding aircraft are clear of the runway.
   3.3.5. Sailplane Launch:
       3.3.5.1. The only authorized method of sailplane launch is by a tow rope attached to a
       tow airplane (aerotow).
       3.3.5.2. Units will determine the minimum tow rope length. Prior to tow rope hookup,
       the pilot will inspect the rope condition and replace if necessary.
       3.3.5.3. Unless local requirements are different, pilots will use visual signals to:
          3.3.5.3.1. Indicate to the tow to take the slack out of the tow rope by leveling the
          wings.
          3.3.5.3.2. Indicate to the tow when ready for takeoff by wagging the rudder. The tow
          should respond with a rudder wag and commence the takeoff.
3.4. Traffic Patterns:
   3.4.1. The maximum traffic pattern bank angle is 45 degrees.
   3.4.2. The minimum safety altitude for a gate finish is 500 feet AGL for a 1 NM radius gate
   or 800 feet AGL for a 2 NM radius gate.
   3.4.3. Pilots will fly traffic patterns to roll out on final above 200 feet AGL minimum.
3.5. Aerobatic Procedures. Pilots will perform aerobatics in approved airspace according to
AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
3.6. Minimum Altitudes. Pilots will:
   3.6.1. Initiate spins above 3,500 feet AGL and recover from spins no lower than 3,000 feet
   AGL. Exception: Initiate competition spins so as to recover above 2,000 feet AGL.
   3.6.2. Recover from spin prevents above 2,000 feet AGL.
   3.6.3. Complete spiral dive, nose-high stall, turning stall, and landing attitude stall recoveries
   above 1,500 feet AGL.
   3.6.4. Complete all aerobatics above 1,200 feet AGL (or higher to maintain final glide
   distance).
   3.6.5. Complete slow flight above 1,000 feet AGL provided the stall indication airspeed was
   determined above 1,500 feet AGL.
   3.6.6. Not use thermalling below 500 feet AGL or once established in a traffic pattern.
   3.6.7. Not perform intentional slack lines or box-the-wash below 1,000 feet AGL.
   3.6.8. Remain above 500 feet AGL during ridge soaring or flight over mountain ranges.
   3.6.9. Complete all slips above 100 feet AGL.
3.7. Acceleration Monitoring Unit (AMU) Procedures (TG-10C Only). If the AMU fails in
flight or indicates abnormal operation, terminate aerobatic maneuvering. Document all AMU
malfunctions in the AFTO Form 781A.

   (takeoff, landing, and traffic patterns) or below 1,000 feet AGL.
3.14. Simulated Emergency Procedures:
   3.14.1. The IP will brief all airborne simulated emergencies before flight.
   3.14.2. Pilots will not practice compound or multiple simulated emergencies in flight, or
   initiate simulated emergencies below 300 feet AGL.
3.15. Nontowered Airfield (NTA) Operations:
   3.15.1. With the OG commander’s approval, aircrews may conduct operations at
   nontowered, public-use airfields as follows:
      3.15.1.1. Aircrews will monitor the published common traffic advisory frequency and
      make all radio calls and position reports recommended in the Aeronautical Information
      Manual (AIM).
      3.15.1.2. Pilots may fly rectangular patterns (as depicted in AIM), and emergency
      procedures patterns. Exception: Pilots may fly overhead and demonstration patterns
      during sanctioned competition and training when approved by the airfield manager.
      3.15.1.3. Aircrews will immediately notify the operations supervisor if any hazardous
      conditions exist at an NTA that would prevent normal operations.
   3.15.2. Each OG commander will require and approve a training program to prepare
   aircrews to operate in the NTA environment. As a minimum, the program will include a
   discussion of all applicable codes of federal regulations, advisory circulars, and AIM
   references on NTA operations. Training will emphasize standard civilian radio phraseology.
3.16. Functional Check Flights (FCF):
   3.16.1. Do not conduct an FCF with other type missions except FCF continuation training
   (CT) or FCF upgrade training flights. All FCF requirements will be accomplished by an FCF
   pilot or a pilot in training status with an FCF IP on board.

   Aircraft, will not be flown or practiced on FCF missions.
3.17. Transfer of Aircraft Control. Pilots must know who has control of the aircraft at all
times.
   3.17.1. The pilot assuming control of the aircraft will state, “I have the aircraft,” and will
   shake the stick. Exception: During high-speed dive recoveries, high-speed aerobatic
   maneuvers, or intentional developed spin recoveries, the pilot assuming control will state, “I
   have the aircraft,” but will not shake the stick.
   3.17.2. The pilot relinquishing control will state, “You have the aircraft.” Once assuming
   control of the aircraft, maintain control until relinquishing it as stated above.
3.18. G-Awareness Exercise. The intent of the G-awareness exercise is to prepare the pilot for
precise high-G maneuvering and evaluate G-meter readings between cockpits (if applicable).
   3.18.1. Pilots will accomplish a G-awareness exercise on every sortie where they plan or are
   likely to maneuver above four Gs. Exception: A G-awareness exercise is optional on
   subsequent sorties with the same crew on the same day.
   3.18.2. A G-awareness exercise will consist of a smooth pull to at least four Gs.
   3.18.3. On dual sorties, pilots will crosscheck G-meter indications between cockpits. If a
   discrepancy exists between the front and rear cockpit G meters, pilots will continue the sortie
   using the most conservative (highest indicated G) display.
3.19. Post Flight. After flight, aircrews will:
   3.19.1. Complete the AFTO 781-series forms and notify maintenance of discrepancies.
   3.19.2. Never leave an aircraft unattended unless it is secured or hangared.
