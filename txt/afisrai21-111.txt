                                           Chapter 4

                                  QUALITY ASSURANCE

4.1. Introduction. Maintenance quality and equipment reliability is the responsibility of all
personnel performing maintenance. The combined efforts of Quality Assurance (QA) personnel,
maintenance leaders, and technicians are necessary to ensure high quality maintenance
production and equipment reliability. The QA staff evaluates the quality of maintenance
accomplished and performs necessary functions to manage AFTAC’s Maintenance
Standardization and Evaluation Program, which provides an objective sampling of the quality of
equipment, the proficiency of maintenance personnel, and the compliance of AFISRA and unit
focus areas, programs, and processes. QA personnel are not an extension of the work force and
shall not be tasked to perform production inspections. QA serves as the primary technical
advisory agency in the maintenance organization, assisting maintenance supervision at all levels
to resolve quality problems. The evaluation and analysis of deficiencies and problem areas are
key functions of QA that highlight and identify underlying causes of poor quality in the
maintenance production effort. Equipment condition and personnel proficiency are validated
through the Maintenance Standardization and Evaluation Program and shall be recorded using an
approved QA database. Note: The COM will determine the most effective structure and may
realign responsibilities under more than one work center or staff function.
4.2. Responsibilities. QA is responsible to AFTAC/LS to perform as the primary technical
advisory agency for maintenance and assists work center supervisors in managing the
maintenance effort. QA inspectors will have authority to observe, correct, and document
maintenance activities. QA personnel will:
   4.2.1. Be knowledgeable of work section responsibilities and procedures.
   4.2.2. Ensure accomplishment of maintenance support responsibilities.
   4.2.3. Ensure personnel are trained on duties, responsibilities, and procedures.
   4.2.4. Provide functional systems management, including maintenance practices, for Center-
   unique systems.
   4.2.5. Review MIS management products.
   4.2.6. Direct and control authorized cannibalization actions IAW TO 00-20-2, Maintenance
   Data Documentation. When cannibalization is the only option available, identify the end
   item to be cannibalized and request approval to cannibalize from the COM or designated
   representative.
4.3. Quality Assurance Superintendent Responsibilities. The QA Superintendent will:
   4.3.1. Make recommendations to AFTAC/LS or AFTAC/COM to enhance the quality of
   maintenance.
   4.3.2. Develop and monitor the Maintenance Standardization and Evaluation Program
   (MSEP) using an approved QA database and provide supervisors access to MSEP data.
   4.3.3. Notify the appropriate agencies when deficiencies are found in instructions.
 14                                                   AFISRAI21-111 18 SEPTEMBER 2012


   4.3.4. Review maintenance related local Operating Instructions (OIs) and IMTs/forms every
   2 years for accuracy and necessity (document these reviews).
   4.3.5. Ensure local checklists are reviewed every 2 years for currency and document this
   review.
   4.3.6. Ensure management and special inspections are performed.
   4.3.7. Coordinate on all requests for locally manufactured, developed, and modified tools
   and equipment, and maintain records for approved requests. This includes pictures or
   drawings and a description of the use for each item. If a TO/TI contains the option of these
   tools or equipment, QA does not need to coordinate or maintain the records on that tool as
   long as the tool remains approved by the TO/TI.
   4.3.8. Develop Key Task and Routine Inspection Listings (KTL/RTL) in addition to
   AFISRA listings, if required, in conjunction with the COM and provide copies of approved
   lists to all affected organizations.
   4.3.9. Ensure Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) standards are developed for all tasks
   including key tasks and routine inspection lists.
   4.3.10. Ensure agendas and presentations are compiled for the MSEP Summary.
   4.3.11. Designate a Chief Inspector.
   4.3.12. Monitor the Self-Inspection Program (SIP).
4.4. Chief Inspector Responsibilities. The QA Chief Inspector will:
   4.4.1. Use assigned inspectors to provide on-the-spot assistance to correct problems.
   4.4.2. Spot-check TO/TIs, inspection work cards, checklists, job guides, and work unit code
   (WUC) manuals during evaluations and inspections for currency and serviceability.
   4.4.3. Assist Program Analysis with investigations and studies.
   4.4.4. Initiate actions when additional attention is required to resolve adverse maintenance
   trends or training problems. Actions include preparing cross-tell information bulletins and
   messages for AFTAC/LS release to other similarly-equipped units and HQ AFISRA.
   4.4.5. Review Category II major discrepancies for trends quarterly. If frequency or severity
   of identified discrepancies warrant inclusion of that item into a specific TO/TI governing an
   action or inspection, the QA Chief Inspector must submit an AFTO IMT 22 or develop a
   local work card, local page supplement, or checklist IAW TO 00-5-1.
   4.4.6. Review MSEP data quarterly to identify high-missed carded items from personnel
   evaluations (PEs) and quality verification inspections (QVIs). A high-missed carded item is
   defined as any work card item missed at least three times during a one-month period.
   Coordinate with Program Analysis to identify any relationships with repeat, recur, and CND
   trends. Include this data in the monthly MSEP summary.
4.5. Quality Assurance Training. Develop a local training plan to train all QA inspector
personnel, to include augmentees.
AFISRAI21-111 18 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                15


   4.5.1. Training must cover inspection and evaluation techniques, documenting inspection
   worksheets, and actions to prevent personnel injury or equipment damage. Document QA
   Inspector training in individual training records or MIS.
   4.5.2. A qualified inspector will conduct an Evaluator Proficiency Evaluation (EPE) on each
   inspector performing one PE and one technical inspection (QVI/Special Inspection). Each
   QA inspector, permanent or augmentee, must pass the EPEs prior to performing
   unsupervised evaluations and inspections.
       4.5.2.1. QA augmentees require an annual EPE on either a PE or technical inspection.
       4.5.2.2. All EPEs must be tracked in the MIS or QA database.
   4.5.3. QA inspectors inspecting outside of their Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) will be
   AFTO Form 797 qualified on the requirements of the KTL they evaluate. Chief Inspectors
   will identify other critical tasks requiring AFTO Form 797 qualification as required. For all
   other tasks, inspectors must be familiar with the requirements/procedures of tasks they
   evaluate.
4.6. Quality Assurance Augmentation. If a functional area does not warrant a full-time
position in QA, but specialized expertise is required, select qualified technicians that are
recommended by their Supt or Branch Chief to be augmentees. Each QA must maintain a listing
of current augmentees. In coordination with AFTAC/LS, the QA Section Chief establishes
augmentee duties.
4.7. Maintenance Standardization and Evaluation Program (MSEP). MSEP is the
systematic, continuous self-evaluation program for AFTAC systems maintenance. MSEP
consists of managerial evaluations. An effective MSEP is essential to successful AFTAC
systems maintenance and requires the full commitment of all maintenance complex resources, to
include the most competent technicians and the production work centers full participation.
   4.7.1. MSEP provides the COM with key indicators to judge the maintenance activity's
   ability to meet mission requirements. The COM is responsible for establishing the MSEP to
   determine the quality of maintenance management, production, and procedures; technician
   competence; and training program effectiveness. MSEP addresses issues from a maintenance
   perspective. Other programs OPRs (i.e., Safety, Security, Personnel, Records Management,
   etc.) maintain responsibilities for their specific program areas. When issues are identified in
   other program areas, they are passed to the appropriate OPR.
   4.7.2. This instruction establishes the minimum requirements for MSEP.
   4.7.3. The COM is functionally responsible for AFTAC systems maintenance management
   programs.
   4.7.4. MSEP establishes periodic evaluations to determine the overall capabilities of the
   maintenance activity, assess the adequacy of technical data, evaluate maintenance actions,
   and ensure satisfactory equipment operation.
   4.7.5. Compliance with MSEP is required for work centers or functions responsible for
   MICAP, MDC reportable, or mission critical systems and equipment (e.g., managerial
   evaluations).
16                                                   AFISRAI21-111 18 SEPTEMBER 2012


  4.7.6. Evaluators use the results to determine the effectiveness of maintenance and
  management practices. Management practices, systems, and facilities must be evaluated
  periodically to identify and correct problems.
     4.7.6.1. Evaluators are the key to the evaluation program and are not to be the same
     individual who certified task proficiency of the person being evaluated. Ideally, the
     evaluator is certified on the tasks being evaluated and possesses the same skill set at a
     higher skill level than the individual being evaluated.
     4.7.6.2. Hard-copy and/or electronic copy of all MSEP evaluation reports will be
     maintained for a minimum of two years.
  4.7.7. Evaluation guides will be used during managerial evaluations for subjects such as
  safety, supply, vehicles, and administration. Evaluators shall use Air Force Maintenance
  Quality Control Checklists (AFMQCCs) and/or Center Maintenance Quality Control
  Checklists (MQCC) for managerial evaluations, as applicable.
  4.7.8. Managerial evaluations provide the senior leadership, the COM, and supervisors with
  factual, objective assessments of a section's ability to meet mission requirements. SAVs,
  Inspector General inspections, and assessments (unit self-assessments, etc.) do not replace
  MSEP managerial evaluations.
     4.7.8.1. Perform managerial evaluations on each staff function and work center at least
     every 24 months. Use appropriate AFMQCCs and Center MQCCs for managerial
     evaluations, as applicable. Ensure applicable areas listed in Paragraph 4.7.8.8. are
     evaluated.
     4.7.8.2. Before beginning managerial evaluations, review reports of previous managerial
     evaluations. Review other evaluation reports such as administrative files evaluations, IG
     evaluations, operational evaluations, SAV reports, maintenance analysis trend data, and
     any other relevant management indicators.
     4.7.8.3. Make impartial, factual, pertinent, and complete observations to identify
     deficiencies. Identify commendable practices and programs, especially those that may be
     useful to other work centers.
     4.7.8.4. Demonstrate proper procedures and provide assistance to help work center and
     staff personnel meet mission requirements.
     4.7.8.5. Ensure affected supervisors fully understand findings before formal evaluation
     reports are written.
     4.7.8.6. Participate in Preventative Maintenance Routines to determine if mission
     requirements are being met.
     4.7.8.7. Evaluate subject areas in enough depth to ensure the results indicate the actual
     condition of the activity. Not all areas require 100 percent evaluation for the evaluator to
     make this determination.
     4.7.8.8. Determine how well work centers and support functions meet production and
     management requirements and if established procedures are followed. The minimum
     evaluation items include, if applicable:
AFISRAI21-111 18 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                               17

 18                                                    AFISRAI21-111 18 SEPTEMBER 2012


          of-tolerance system or equipment measurements exist, are examples of procedural
          deficiencies.
          4.7.8.9.2. References are not required when a deficiency or isolated minor error is
          easily understood and corrective action is obvious. General housekeeping practices,
          equipment cleanliness, and standard supervisory responsibilities and safety practices
          are examples of areas that may not require references.
          4.7.8.9.3. Deficiencies caused by inefficient or ineffective management practices
          may require the use of rationale since a specific reference may not be published. The
          COM resolves differences of opinion over the validity of the type of discrepancy
          before reports are finalized.
          4.7.8.9.4. Include recommendations for corrective actions with each deficiency,
          except where the corrective action is obvious.
          4.7.8.9.5. Document favorable comments, as well as deficiencies on MSEP
          evaluation reports.
          4.7.8.9.6. The COM is the closing authority for MSEP evaluations. The COM may
          indicate closure by concurrence or non-concurrence with the evaluator's
          recommendations. The COM may delegate closing authority for managerial
          evaluation reports that identify only minor or no discrepancies.
          4.7.8.9.7. Use of AF Form 2420, Quality Control Inspection Summary, to document
          managerial evaluations is a COM option. Managerial evaluations results may be
          prepared in a narrative style on bond paper and attached to the AF Form 2419,
          Routing and Review of Quality Control Reports, or equivalent automated product.
          4.7.8.9.8. Managerial evaluation reports address minimum coverage areas and list
          deficiencies found in the areas of management, system equipment, and task
          performance.     Reports show correlation between deficiencies, if applicable.
          Additionally, the reports address production and mission requirements not being met
          and the causes behind these shortfalls.
4.8. Deficiency Analysis. The COM will provide the MAM and the maintenance organization a

   Historical Data, print a copy of the TCTO history from the MIS TCTO subsystem and attach
   a copy of the AFTO Form 95, for equipment being turned in or transferred.
5.10. Work Center TMDE Management. Ensure work center TMDE management
responsibilities are accomplished and that required TMDE, shop mock-ups, and test fixtures are
available and properly maintained.
   5.10.1. Work center supervisors ensure compliance with user and organizational
   maintenance responsibilities and appoint a work center TMDE monitor to ensure TMDE is
   properly managed. Work center TMDE monitors perform a key role to ensure serviceable
   TMDE is available to work center technicians when and where it is needed.
   5.10.2. Work center supervisors and work center TMDE monitors will establish and
   effectively maintain a TMDE account IAW the following directives: AFI 21-113, Air Force
   Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL) Program; TO 00-20-14-CD-1, Air Force
   Metrology and Calibration Program; TO 33-1-27, Logistics Support of Precision
   Measurement Equipment; TO 33K-1-100-CD-1, MDE Calibration Notes Maintenance Data

   5.10.6. Locally Procured TMDE. Determine the supporting PMELs ability to maintain and
   calibrate TMDE before making a local purchase.
5.11. Work Center Not Repairable This Station (NRTS) Process. The production work
center supervisor is responsible for verifying proposed NRTS actions within their respective
work center. Work center supervisors will:
   5.11.1. Determine if a cost effective repair capability is available in other work centers, on
   base, or through local procurement prior to completing the NRTS action.
5.12. Work Center Tool Control Management. The objectives of the tool and equipment
management program are to prevent and eliminate abuse and reduce costs through strict effective
control and accountability of assets. To ensure standardization among maintenance units,
commanders and key leaders are responsible for executing an effective tool program. The tool
management program outlined in this instruction represents AFTAC minimum program
requirements.
   5.12.1. The COM is the OPR for management of tools/equipment guidance. As a minimum,
   guidance will address the following:
       5.12.1.1. Standardized procedures for security, control, and accountability (e.g., chits,
       manual, barcode, etc.) of tools and equipment.
       5.12.1.2. Inventory requirements.
       5.12.1.3. Procedures for control and management of replacement, expendable and
       consumable hand tools, HAZMATs, and other items contained in composite tool kits/tool
       kits (CTKs/TKs).
       5.12.1.4. Procedures for transfer of tools/CTKs/TKs at the job site. CTKs/TKs are not
       normally passed from one individual to another at the job site; however, mission needs
       occasionally require this action to occur. Ensure tool accountability and control is
       maintained when transfer occurs between the individuals.
       5.12.1.5. Procedures for lost or missing tools.
       5.12.1.6. Assignment of equipment identification designators (EID) for CTKs/TKs, non-
       CA/CRL equipment, and assignment of CTK/TK numbers for tools.
       5.12.1.7. Procedures for control of locally manufactured or developed tools and
       equipment.
   5.12.2. The COM will designate CTK/TK custodians in writing or will delegate to branch
   level authority. CTK/TK custodians are responsible for tool, HAZMAT, and consumable
   asset accountability and control. NOTE: A separate person may be designated as the
   HAZMAT monitor.
   5.12.3. Flight chiefs/section NCOICs (or equivalents) determine the type, size, contents, and
   number of CTKs required for their work centers.
   5.12.4. Design CTK/TKs to provide a quick inventory and accountability of tools. Clearly
   mark all CTKs/TKs and tools with the EID
   5.12.5. CTK/TK contents will be standardized to the maximum extent possible within
   functional elements that have similar missions.
AFISRAI21-111 18 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                               25


  5.12.6. Each tool, item of equipment, or consumable contained in a CTK/TK has an assigned
  location identified either by inlay cuts in the shape of the item, shadowed layout, label, or
  silhouette. No more than one item is stored in a cutout, shadow, or silhouette except for tools
  issued in sets such as drill bits, Allen wrenches, apexes, or paired items (e.g., gloves,
  booties).
  5.12.7. A Master Inventory List (MIL) is required for each CTK or series of identical CTKs.
  A hard copy of the MIL must reside with each dispatchable CTK or series of identical kits.
     5.12.7.1. Contents are identified on the MIL by drawer/section indicating the number
     and type of each item in the CTK and total number of all items in each drawer/section.
     5.12.7.2. If chits/dog tags/identification tags or similar tags or dust caps are attached to
     tools/equipment, they will be secured. Locks, keys, and tie down straps, if not
     permanently attached, will be marked/etched with the appropriate CTK number. All
     items are listed on the MIL.
     5.12.7.3. Consumables may be placed in CTKs. If so, they are identified on the MIL as
     consumables. Examples of consumables include; safety wire, adhesive, wire bundle
     lacing, solder, etc. Do not include common hardware items such as bolts, nuts, and/or
     screws unless they are required as tools.
     5.12.7.4. Tool sets are identified on the MIL by total number of items in the set (e.g.,
     Allen wrench set - 9 each Allen wrenches + container for a total of 10).
     5.12.7.5. Document missing, removed, and/or broken tools/items if they cannot be
     replaced immediately. In addition, for dispatchable CTKs and dispatchable support
     equipment/dispatchable special tools containing multiple parts, document the missing,
     removed, and/or broken tools/items on a locally generated form, or on the hard copy
     MIL. Pencil/pen may be used for hard copy MIL documentation and erased when
     cleared. Remove the EID from any permanently removed tool/item. A permanently
     removed (without planned replacement) tool/item constitutes a change to the inventory
     and requires a new MIL.
     5.12.7.6. The CTK/TK custodian has the authority to interchange "like" (form, fit,
     function) items.
  5.12.8. Equipment and accessories that will not leave the work center, support section, or
  tool room need not be included in a CTK/TK; however, this equipment must have designated
  storage locations established. Designated locations may be work areas or stations.
  5.12.9. Tools not controlled through CTK/TK procedures are NOT authorized in any
  maintenance area (e.g., personally-purchased tools, mini-mag flashlights, Leatherman multi-
  tools, buck knives, etc.). AFTAC will develop procedures to mark and control equipment
  that a work center assigns/issues to an individual.
  5.12.10. Tool Accountability.       Section NCOICs, through CTK/TK custodians, are
  responsible for tool and equipment accountability and control (knowing where tools are and
  who has responsibility for them). When a person signs for a tool or piece of equipment, they
  are accountable for them until it is returned to the work center and accountability transfers
  back to the CTK/TK custodian.
26                                                 AFISRAI21-111 18 SEPTEMBER 2012


     5.12.10.1. All AFTAC units must use an approved system for accountability and control
     of tools and equipment.
        5.12.10.1.1. AFTAC units may use a chit system, AF IMT 1297, or a locally
        approved form for accountability and control of CTKs/TKs, equipment, and tools.
        When using a chit system, chits are controlled as tools, to include the beginning and
        end of shift inventory. Do not issue chits directly to individuals or remove them from
        tool rooms. Chit control boards are located in secure locations.
        5.12.10.1.2. Account for all CTKs/TKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment at the
        beginning and end of each shift. Shift inventories must be documented by both
        outgoing and incoming personnel. CTKs/TKs that have not been utilized during the
        shift do not need to be opened for inventory.
            5.12.10.1.2.1. Perform a visual inventory of all CTKs/TKs when issued for use,
            at the completion of job or tasks, and when returned to the work center or tool
            storage facility. Accomplish a CTK/TK inventory prior to operation of any
            equipment when maintenance actions were performed. Note: Upon returning to
            the work area after sheltering from real-world/exercise events an immediate and
            complete inventory of all CTKs/TKs will be conducted.
            5.12.10.1.2.2. At least annually or when the CTK/TK custodian changes, conduct
            a comprehensive inventory of all tools, non-CA/CRL equipment, and CTKs/TKs.
            The purpose of this inventory is to perform an extensive inspection of all tools
            and non-CA/CRL equipment, to include condition, identification markings, and
            accuracy of the MIL/TK/CRL Supplemental Listing. Inspect all tools for
            serviceability IAW TO 32-1-2, Use and Care of Hand Tools.             CTK/TK
            custodians document these inventories and maintain the most current inventory
            documentation on file.
  5.12.11. All AFTAC units must mark their tools and equipment with a location-unique EID
  or marking and utilize an approved system. Geographically separated units may use the
  parent unit EID. New tools (spare replacements) stored away from the CTK/TK do not need
  to be etched or marked until placement in a specific CTK/TK.
     5.12.11.1. The EID will consist of eight characters (numbers/letters) of which the first
     four characters will be a unique AFTAC/work center code. AFTAC units that utilize a
     marking system will identify each CTK/TK with a unique color or marking that identifies
     the owning work center.
     5.12.11.2. The unit establishes the remaining four characters (any combination of
     numbers/letters) or markings for CTKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment.
     5.12.11.3. Units must place the EID on all CTKs, tools not assigned to a box, and
     dispatchable equipment that is of sufficient size. The EID must be placed on the outside
     of dispatchable CTKs. Units may affix non-metallic bar code labels on tools to prevent
     re-etching as long as the use of the tool and its work environment does not normally
     result in excessive damage to the label, making it unreadable. Tools will be marked with
     the most current EID. All previous CTK identifiers will either be removed or marked out
     (this does not include PMEL markings).
AFISRAI21-111 18 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                              27


         5.12.11.3.1. Small tools or items that cannot be marked as described above (such as
         drill bits, Allen wrench sets, apexes, etc.) are to be maintained in a container marked
         with the EID.
     5.12.11.4. The Chief of Maintenance may require use of the EID and AFTO Form 65
     (metallic)/AFTO Form 66 (non-metallic) for TMDE routinely (i.e., once per week)
     dispatched from a work center or use of the AFTO Form 65/66 alone. For items that
     physically or mechanically check tolerances that require calibration, do not etch or stamp
     in any manner that will affect calibration or the ability to calibrate. If marking is in
     question, the owning work center shall consult PMEL.
  5.12.12. All locally manufactured, developed, or modified tools and equipment used on
  aerospace equipment must be approved by the Chief of Maintenance or their designated
  representative. This procedure does not apply to local manufacture, modification, or design
  of tools authorized in specific technical data. Quality Assurance coordinates on all requests
  for approval and use of locally designed tools or equipment. Users will review items and
  requirements biennially (every two years) for applicability and current configuration.
  5.12.13. Supervisors ensure all assigned personnel are familiar with lost tool procedures. If

Terms
Chief of Maintenance (COM)—The senior manager, other than the commander, responsible for
maintenance.
Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)—There is no single definition of a "COTS-based system".
Instead, there is a spectrum of ways that systems can incorporate COTS products. All new
acquisition programs pose challenges for system integration and require specialized management
once fielded. At two extremes of this spectrum are the following: - A COTS-Solution system is
one in which a single product, or suite of products, provides the essential solution in an
application area. Such a system is constructed by tailoring the product to specific business needs
and usually only a single vendor relationship is involved. – A COTS-Intensive system is one in
which system capabilities are achieved through the integration of several COTS software
products from multiple software vendors. In such cases, either the application area is unique, or
the scope of the system is sufficiently large to preclude the probability of a single commercial
solution. - These two are extremes, and most systems will fall somewhere in the middle.
Contract Maintenance—Accomplish contract maintenance surveillance program duties IAW
procurement guidelines and command directives.
Logistics Maintenance and Engineering—The Logistics Maintenance Engineering Branch is
directly responsible to the COM and directs the performance of maintenance engineering, depot,
and deployable maintenance services to accomplish upgrades or maintenance activities at
locations requiring maintenance assistance. The Branch provides direct oversight of the
Geophysical Equipment Maintenance Section which provides the mobile maintenance repair
capability to the COM and the sustainment maintenance section which provides intermediate and
depot level maintenance.
Logistics Support—The Logistics Support Branch is directly responsible to the COM for the
maintenance, supply, transportation, documentation, and contract support of AFTAC mission
systems. The branch oversees the Center's acquisition requirements process by providing
guidance, training, and policy development. The branch is responsible to provide supply and
transportation requirements for both CONUS and overseas units. The branch acts as the
Contracting Technical Representative and Program Manager for all logistics, maintenance,

Maintenance Activity—All staff functions, management support functions, and all production
work centers directly or functionally responsible to a single chief of maintenance.
Maintenance Capability—Maintenance capability is AFTAC's ability to maintain its assigned
systems and equipment in proper condition. Managers and supervisors must plan/schedule
maintenance to ensure personnel are productively employed, ensure personnel have appropriate
skill/technical level, and justify enough resources to support a maintenance workload.
Maintenance Information System (MIS)—MIS refers to the automated MIS which may
include the Sampler Operations and Data System and Maximo Enterprise Suite.
Maintenance Organization—AFTAC's complex is comprised of the Chief of Maintenance,
Maintenance Superintendent, Systems Control, Plans and Programs, Logistics Support,
Engineering and Maintenance, Material Collection, and numerous work center supervisors and
their respective work centers (to include detachments).
Maintenance Work Centers—Maintenance work centers are the production elements under the
COM and are responsible for accomplishing all maintenance and providing operational status
changes as they occur. Maintenance production work centers are supported by and must
maintain a close working relationship with the maintenance staff. All 9S100 personnel in
maintenance positions are considered traditional maintenance technicians.
Materials Collection—The Materials Collection Systems Branch is directly responsible to the
COM for the execution of MAM tasking related to the materials collection mission to include
new system development, operational deployment, and overall network management. The
branch exercises functional control over material systems work centers.
Metrics—The COM may use maintenance management metrics (e.g., operational availability,
personnel training status, etc.) to better forecast resources.
Plans and Programs—The Plans and Programs Branch is responsible for COM guidance
generation, development of logistic and maintenance processes, and to ensure effective
maintenance and management practices are used throughout the maintenance activity.
Restoral—To bring mission critical system back to a former position or condition. To return a
system to fully operational capability.

          AIR FORCE MAINTENANCE QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLISTS

A2.1. AFMQCC are guides used primarily by Quality Assurance to help determine equipment
condition, maintenance quality, and maintenance management effectiveness. Work center and
staff functions may use AFMQCCs when performing self-inspections. AFMQCCs are
standardized and published on AF Form 3900, Quality Control Check Sheet. AFMQCCs are not
directive. Resolve conflicts between AFMQCCs and TOs or other official AF publications in
favor of the higher-level publication. Do not use AFMQCCs to operate, maintain (e.g., tuning,
aligning, adjusting, etc.), or troubleshoot equipment. Do not limit equipment or management
evaluations to the checks in the AFMQCCs. Add other checks to ensure a thorough evaluation.
MAJCOMs may add any additional checks necessary to ensure unique mission requirements are
met.
   A2.1.1. Minor and common pieces of equipment may not need a separate AFMQCC, but
   may be covered by general-type AFMQCCs.
   A2.1.2. Similar items of equipment (i.e., fuse panels, station batteries, panels, power
   supplies, etc.) may be included in a general AFMQCC. They contain those checks common
   to all or most of the similar equipment items. If required, local units may add additional
   checks for an individual equipment type.
   A2.1.3. Use general check sheets in conjunction with equipment specific check sheets.
   A2.1.4. AFMQCCs          may     be    obtained     from     the     following     website:
   https://private.afca.af.mil/c-emaint.mqcss.htm.
A2.2. AFTAC unique Maintenance Quality Control Checklists (MQCC) are established by this
instruction.
   A2.2.1. The COM authorizes the use of local MQCCs only when AFMQCCs or Center
   MQCCs do not exist.
   A2.2.2. Local MQCCs:
       A2.2.2.1. Are conspicuously marked or labeled as local MQCCs.
       A2.2.2.2. Are not retained or used after an AF or Center MQCC is published on the same
       item of equipment, grouping of equipment (general MQCC), or management function.
       A2.2.2.3. Supplement AF or Center MQCCs if local requirements dictate.

                                          Attachment 5
                         CLIMBING TRAINING REQUIREMENTS

A5.1. Climbing Training Requirements. The only personnel authorized to climb poles and
towers are those who have been properly trained, to include Pole Top Rescue, and are certified or
in a training status under the observation of a qualified instructor. This requires military and
civilian personnel to maintain climbing proficiency at those units that have climbing
requirements as part of the unit mission (see OSHA STD 910.269, Electric Power Generation,
Transmission, and Distribution). Although general safety and climbing principles are similar,
different types of structures (e.g., towers, wood poles, metal poles, antennas, etc.) present unique
challenges and require training approaches that are tailored to the specific type of structure.
Commanders, supervisors, or team members will prohibit individuals from climbing when a
potentially unsafe condition exists (e.g., environmental, mental, physical, lack of experience,
etc.).
   A5.1.1. These requirements are applicable to active duty, ANG, and AF Reserve units. In
   addition, these standards and procedures apply to civilian personnel who are required to
   perform these tasks in their duty positions IAW AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap
   Prevention Program.
A5.2. The COM and local detachment commander or detachment chiefs will designate, in
writing, all personnel required to maintain climbing proficiency.
A5.3. Initial Certification Procedures. Graduates of the Communications Cable and Antenna
Systems Apprentice Course or other accredited climbing courses are recognized by the C-E AF
Career Field Manager as qualified climbers for a period of 90 days from the graduation date. At
those units with existing climbing capabilities, the gaining unit must evaluate the graduates
within 90 days from the graduation date to verify and document qualifications. The individual
will be tested (oral and/or written and by practical demonstration) to ascertain knowledge of
standard climbing safety practices and proficiency in climbing practices and procedures. This
requirement ensures individuals who must climb and use protective devices are fully qualified
and physically capable of climbing and working aloft. Decertify the individual if the initial
evaluation exceeds the 90-day period.
   A5.3.1. With exception of personnel identified in paragraph A5.2, commanders will restrict
   climbing authorizations to structures that must be climbed to accomplish mission
   requirements. The allowable height of climbing is based on mission requirements.
   Document the limited climbing authorizations.
   A5.3.2. Technicians in career fields that do not receive initial climbing training in an
   apprentice course will receive initial training from a qualified training certifier. Certification
   will be limited to the type of structures required to accomplish work center task
   requirements. (See paragraph A5.5 for certification resources.)
   A5.3.3. Climbing training will be accomplished in increments of progressively higher
   heights using fall protection and restraint equipment. Once the trainee has demonstrated
   climbing confidence and ability at the various heights, evaluate the individual without using
   fall protection equipment to a locally-determined training height.
A5.4. Recertification Procedures. Climbing recertification is an annual requirement.
AFISRAI21-111 18 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                39


   A5.4.1. Personnel who have not climbed within the last 12 months require refresher training
   utilizing full fall protection and fall restraint devices.
   A5.4.2. Annual recertification may be satisfied by demonstrating climbing proficiency
   anytime climbing is performed while completing actual job requirements or training events
   under supervision of a qualified certifier. Full fall protection is not required unless the
   individual has never received initial certification, exceeded the 12-month recertification
   period, or has been determined unqualified by the certifier.
   A5.4.3. Decertify personnel not qualified to perform climbing tasks and restrict from
   climbing until recertified. The climbing instructor will determine the training requirements.
A5.5. Certification Resources. Installations without a climbing certifier will use an alternate
source for climbing certification (e.g., local climbing courses, Equipment Installation, Cable and
Antenna Teams, Special Maintenance Team, etc.).
A5.6. Training Documentation. Document certification.
A5.7. Climbing Certifier Requirements. Climbing certifier will:
   A5.7.1. Complete climbing certification training.
   A5.7.2. Be designated, in writing, by the commander or designated individual to conduct
   climbing certification.
   A5.7.3. Be current in CPR and first aid training.
   A5.7.4. Demonstrate ability to perform and teach complex tasks aloft.
   A5.7.5. Be certified to train individuals in Pole Top Rescue.
   A5.7.6. Use a training plan to conduct Pole Top Rescue and climbing certification.
   A5.7.7. Maintain climbing proficiency and knowledge of current OSHA requirements.
   A5.7.8. Determine and arrange for the specific safety equipment to use during performance
   evaluations.
   A5.7.9. Provide and evaluate a written and/or oral knowledge test.
   A5.7.10. Evaluate individuals during task preparation and performance.
A5.8. References. Refer to the following references for more detailed guidance related to
climbing: TO 31W3-10-19C1, TO 31-10-3, and applicable OSHA and AFOSH Standards.
