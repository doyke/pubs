1. General. This instruction identifies preparation and general actions necessary for LRS units
deploying for Annual Tours and outlines references, guidelines, and responsibilities (NOT all-
inclusive). A sample preparation checklist is provided in Table 2
2. Guidelines:
   2.1. The yearly annual tour scheduling process is started by the 3rd QTR of each fiscal year
   for the following fiscal year. The scheduling process includes members from HQ
   AFRC/A4RX, each Numbered Air Force (NAF), and the affected unit.
 2                                                          AFRCI25-101 22 SEPTEMBER 2011


     2.2. HQ AFRC/A4RX will initiate a planning schedule and coordinate it through the process
     outlined in Table 1 All tasked agencies must complete their actions by the indicated suspense
     date to ensure a viable product.
     2.3. Annual tours are used to obtain maximum hands-on and upgrade training. Priority will
     be given to training members to their assigned UTC position. Additional training may then
     be given to increase member’s skill sets in other UTCs. Team size depends on support
     capability of the training site and training needs of the deploying unit. An entire unit may be
     scheduled for an AT to support an exercise.
     2.4. To facilitate effective scheduling, the following priority list is provided for unit
     commanders to consider during their planning:
         2.4.1. Aerospace Expeditionary Forces (AEF) obligations. Commanders need to consider
         AEF commitment time lines.
         2.4.2. MAJCOM Command Inspection Calendars (CIC).
         2.4.3. ORE scheduling by assigned wing for upcoming ORI.
         2.4.4. ATs are primarily for training Airmen. If quality training can be obtained and the
         LRS is assisted in a surge period, this is a plus for the supported LRS. However, first
         consideration must be training not workload.
         2.4.5. Consider planning and scheduling your annual tours in two different categories,
         (1) high OPS tempo locations which are better for proficiency training, (2) a lower OPS
         tempo so more time is available for upgrade and task training.

                    Start planning training requirements for the fiscal year
                    scheduling process. Each unit should start planning what will be
                    needed for annual tours, dates and locations based on training needs
     Units                                                                                      15 April
                    as suggested in 1.2.4.5. Until a master training schedule is received,
                    time frames should be approximate i.e. January or February etc for
                    planning purposes.
               Create Annual Tour (AT) planning schedule based on FY
     AFRC/A4RX calendar and forward to MAJCOMs for priority input and
               requesting host unit POCs.                                                       20 April

                  Unit Commanders determine their most urgent training needs and
  Units           personnel availability for ATs throughout the fiscal year. Contact
                  MAJCOM POCs (they provide information such as team size limits,        28 May
                  available training, AFSC limits and other pertinent information
                  crucial to planning tours). Schedule annual tours for 2-week
                  segments, normally beginning/ending on a weekend, unless the unit
                  commander specifically requests otherwise.


            AFRC will consolidate respective unit’s inputs and resolve any
  AFRC/A4RX training location conflicts from the unit’s inputs such as exceeding         4 June
            location size limitations etc.
            Consolidate all inputs onto a master schedule and identifies any
  AFRC/A4RX conflicts. A master schedule will be sent back to the units with all         18 June
            conflicts identified to be resolved.
            Input schedule into SMS and obtain DRWG/DRB approval
  AFRC/A4RX Deployments not approved by the DRWG/DRB process will be                     25 June
            returned to the unit for resolution.
  AFRC/A4RX Provide approved AT schedule to units.                                       30 June

3. Deployment Approval Process (Annual Tour) - Overview.
   3.1. All training deployments must be approved by the Deployment Review Working Group
   (DRWG) chaired by the AFRC/A3 prior to being presented to the Deployment Review Board
   (DRB) chaired by AFRC/CV.
   3.2. All training deployments are entered into the Single Mobility System (SMS) as a
   pending deployment, coded "P". The DRWG and DRB meet quarterly to review and
   consider "P" deployments for approval. Approved deployments will be recoded in SMS
   from "P" to "A" (Approved). "A" deployments will be sent electronically to the AFRC/A3
   to solicit organic airlift and the units notified of approval.
   3.3. The Airlift Allocations Conference (AAC) convenes approximately two weeks after the
   DRB to determine the availability of organic airlift.
   3.4. If organic airlift is unavailable, and the deployment was approved for commercial travel
   funds, units will forward a request for funding to AFRC/A4RX FAM. The FAM will utilize
   AT allocated funds to finance the commercial air costs.
   3.5. The Deployment Review Board (DRB) consists of HQ AFRC directors and heads of
   special staff agencies and is chaired by the AFRC/CV. The DRB meets before the AAC to
   approve/disapprove deployments.
      3.5.1. Changes or cancellation of scheduled deployments must be coordinated through
      the NAF and training location to prevent adverse affects on host base (training location)
 4                                                         AFRCI25-101 22 SEPTEMBER 2011


        facilities, airlift requirements and funding allocations. Ensure justification is provided for
        cancellation/deviation from scheduled deployment.
4. Deployments Not Scheduled Through The Normal Scheduling Process:
     4.1. Units must submit non-scheduled deployment requests to their appropriate NAF. Once
     the NAF POC validates these requests, they are forwarded to AFRC/A4RX for submission
     into SMS and presentation to the DRWG/DRB.
5. Unit Responsibilities for all Deployments:
     5.1. Units must follow the guidance for all deployments (Annual Tour, base exercises, etc)
     as outlined in AFI 10-403. Deployment of personnel as required in AFI 10-403 or other
     applicable instructions/supplements can be satisfied, when applicable, through an AT
     deployment if personnel actually process through a personnel processing line set up by a host
     unit.
     5.2. Unit LRS will:
        5.2.1. Establish an SMS account (view only) through USTRANSCOM.
        5.2.2. Review unit deployments through SMS to determine status, airlift, etc.
        5.2.3. Initiate checklist (Table 1.2 Checklist for Deployment Actions) for each
        deployment and provide to the deployment Team Chief (TC).
        5.2.4. Obtain commercial reservations for annual tour teams as appropriate.
        5.2.5. Submit area clearance request according to DoD 4500.54G, Foreign Clearance
        Guide, with an information copy to the appropriate NAF/POC.
        5.2.6. Ensure appropriate travel orders are published in sufficient time to allow team
        members to prepare for their tour of duty. NOTE: An AT could be extended up to a total
        of 20 days, including travel, if transportation difficulties arise (See AFMAN 36-2254,
        Volume 1, Reserve Personnel Participation).
        5.2.7. All members must use the Government Travel Card (GTC) issued to them, as
        prescribed by current GTC policy, for incurred expenses on all authorized deployments
        including annual tours. Any member not in good standing with his/her Government
        Travel Card will need a letter from their Commander authorizing advance pay through
        the base FM.
        5.2.8. Keep the commander and staff informed of deployment status.
     5.3. Deployment Team Chief will:
        5.3.1. Confirm deployment information with the UDM.
        5.3.2. Maintain and update a checklist of required actions (Table 2.).
        5.3.3. Prepare the Annual Tour Training Plan
            5.3.3.1. The Annual Tour Training Plan (ATTP) is used to communicate pertinent
            information to the host unit. It includes lodging requests, travel information, work
            assignments, type training required etc. Prepare this document in memorandum
            format according to figure 1.1.

        5.3.3.2. Ensure specific training objectives are established for all team members
        including officers and senior NCOs. Senior NCOs may be assigned to work with a
        functional area supervisor.
        5.3.3.3. Submit the ATTP to the host unit NLT 45 days before team arrival.
        Coordinate computer access with host unit.
        5.3.3.4. Request Assistance from Senior ART and/or Log Plans office when:
           5.3.3.4.1. A unit deployment requirement is in conflict with that of the airlifter.
           5.3.3.4.2. There is a change in the support capability of the airlifter; i.e., lack of
           seating, arrival/departure dates or maintenance delay. NOTE: An AT could be
           extended up to a total of 20 days, including travel, if transportation difficulties
           arise (See AFMAN 36-8001 AFRC SUP1).
