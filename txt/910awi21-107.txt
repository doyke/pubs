This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance. It pre-
scribes and explains procedures to lock and secure aircraft parked on the flightline. It applies to all air-
craft maintenance and operations division personnel that fly with aircraft assigned to Youngstown Air
Reserve Station.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision updates ter-
minologies and office symbols.


1. Objective. This instruction provides a system for securing aircraft when they are parked and unat-
tended. It is intended to protect the aircraft from pilferage, theft, and unauthorized movement.

2. Responsibilities. The Aircraft Maintenance Squadron Superintendent is responsible for compliance
with the contents of this instruction and to ensure that subordinate personnel comply with the procedures
in detail.

3. Procedures.
   3.1. Security. Each aircraft will be equipped with a combination lock for the forward crew entry door.
   Aircraft lock combinations, including transients, are maintained in the Maintenance Operations Cen-
   ter (MOC). The lock will be installed securing the aircraft during periods when the aircraft is unat-
   tended on the flight line parking areas and during non-duty periods. Paratroop door and emergency
   exit hatch interior locking devices will be installed with indicator visible through window. All over-
   head hatches will be installed and flight deck swing windows closed.

    3.2. Aircraft Off-Station Operations. When an aircraft departs the station for operational missions,
    the lock will be on board the aircraft to provide off-station security of the aircraft. The responsibility
    to maintain a lock on the aircraft rests with the Aircraft MXS Superintendent.
