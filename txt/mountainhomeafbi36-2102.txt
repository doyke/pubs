(MHAFB) Form 4, Deployed Gunfighter Information Worksheet. It applies to all Unit
Deployment Managers, officers, and enlisted personnel assigned to the 366th Fighter Wing (366
FW) to include associated units. Ensure all records (e.g., MHAFB Form 4) created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. Contact supporting records managers as

1. General. The purpose of this instruction is to require those who receive notice of a
deployment/temporary duty (TDY) for 30 days or more, or a remote assignment, to complete the
MHAFB Form 4. Gunfighter support is considered mission essential and effectiveness of TDY
or remote personnel is significantly enhanced when they have knowledge that their families are
being cared for at home. Primary responsibility for implementing this program will be at the
squadron/unit level where completed forms should be maintained. The MHAFB Form 4 can be
found in Attachment 2, Sample MHAFB Form 4.
2. Implementation:
   2.1. Immediately upon notification of a deployment or TDY of 30 days or more.
   2.2. Immediately upon notification of a remote assignment where family members will
   reside in the local area.

    2.3. Immediately when requested by individuals departing for less than 30 days, due to
    circumstances the squadron/unit commander deems warrant assistance.
3. Responsibilities:
    3.1. 366 FW/CC (Commander) will establish policy and procedures concerning the
    MHAFB Form 4, Deployed Gunfighter Information Worksheet.
    3.2. Airman & Family Readiness Center (A&FRC) Wing Family Readiness
    Noncommissioned Officer (WFRNCO) will:
       3.2.1. Ensure MHAFB Form 4 is completed by every member out-processing on
       deployment or TDY of 30 days or more, or on a remote tour, collect forms and
       disseminate to units. (This process will be simulated for exercises.)
       3.2.2. Utilize Form 4 to update family information in Air Force Family Integrated Report
       & Statistical Tracking (AFFIRST).
    3.3. Squadron commanders will:
       3.3.1. Ensure A&FRC is a mandatory item on squadron out-processing checklists to
       ensure unit personnel complete the MHAFB Form 4, which will be collected by the
       WFRNCO.
       3.3.2. Ensure squadron/unit receives MHAFB Form 4 from the WFRNCO to be used for
       contacting families and maintaining records.
       3.3.3. Ensure squadron personnel understand a completed MHAFB Form 4 is
       mandatory; however, disclosure of family information on this worksheet is voluntary.
       Without family information, squadron personnel may not be able to contact families to
       provide the required assistance/information.

       all families of active duty military members on remote assignment who reside in the local
       area. The 366 FSS/CC has primary responsibility for support of all other families of
       active duty military members on remote assignment who reside in the local area
       regardless of their branch of service.
       3.3.5. Encourage appropriate squadron personnel, including key spouses, to work with
       the squadron first sergeant to contact families to verify safety, security and general well
       being.
    3.4. 366 FSS/CC will:
       3.4.1. Ensure the WFRNCO collects the completed MHAFB Form 4 when a member
       out-processes for deployment/TDY of 30 days or more or for a remote tour and provides
       the form to the appropriate squadron.
       3.4.2. Ensure 366 FSS/CCF has primary responsibility for support of all other families of
       active duty military on remote assignment who reside in the local area regardless of their
       branch of service.

    processing checklists.
