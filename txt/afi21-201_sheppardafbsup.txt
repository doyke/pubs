                                          Chapter 1

                                     INTRODUCTION

1.1. Munitions Transformation:
   1.1.1. The Air Force munitions community operates in an environment that fosters
   Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) to continuously focus on logistics and maintenance
   transformation.
   1.1.2. Transformation of munitions processes and policy is a continuous and iterative effort.
   The Air Force Maintenance Executive Board (AFMEB) serves as the executive body to
   address enterprise issues through Enterprise Logistics Governance (ELG) process.
1.2. Deviations and Waivers. Units shall notify the MAJCOM and info the Lead MAJCOM
and parent Numbered Air Force (NAF) of conflicts in guidance and submit technical
improvement reports when appropriate. MAJCOMs provide direction for small and unique
organizations when resource or contract limitations prevent compliance with this AFI. See AFI
21-200, Munitions and Missile Maintenance Management for guidance on small and unique
organizations.
   1.2.1. Deviations are permanent departures from standards and do not require periodic
   resubmission. MAJCOMs will validate all approved deviations annually.
   1.2.1. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Any procedural changes or deviations from this instruction
   will be coordinated through the MASO or Chief COR prior to implementation.
   1.2.2. Waivers provide a temporary grace period for units unable to immediately comply
   with existing guidance. Waivers must be resubmitted annually for re-approval.
   1.2.3. Unless specific exception is provided in this instruction, IAW AFI 33-360, submit
   waiver and deviation requests to the OPR, AF/A4LW, who will determine if a waiver request
   requires elevation to the approval authority, AF/A4L.
   1.2.4. The Maintenance Group Commander (MXG) or equivalent AF Commander will sign
   all deviation or waiver requests initiated at the unit level.
       1.2.4.1. Active duty units submit requests through the MAJCOM; info Numbered Air
       Force (NAF) and Lead MAJCOM.
       1.2.4.2. Reserve and Guard units submit requests to HQ Air Force Reserve Command
       (AFRC) or National Guard Bureau (NGB).
       1.2.4.3. If the MAJCOM, AFRC, or NGB concurs, forward the waiver/deviation request
       to AF/A4LW. As the OPR, AF/A4LW will review and if warranted, elevate to the
       AF/A4L for approval.
       1.2.4.4. Physical or functional consolidation of activities approved by AFI 21-200 are
       not considered deviations or waivers. MAJCOM approval enables their awareness of
       their organization’s operating structures.
       1.2.4.5. Parent MAJCOMs will forward all MAJCOM approved deviations/waivers to
       AF/A4LW to assess potential policy impacts. All deviation and waiver requests shall
       include:

          1.2.4.5.2. Duration and the anticipated date of compliance.
          1.2.4.5.3. Munitions facility numbers involved.
          1.2.4.5.4. Mission impacts or risks assumed by non-compliance with policy.
          1.2.4.5.5. Proposed workarounds or alternative methods to comply with policy.
          1.2.4.5.6. Information helpful in the evaluation of deviation or waiver requests.
   1.2.5. Test or trial programs on munitions items that deviate from munitions specific T.O.s
   or procedures require Lead MAJCOM and Program/Engineering/Technical authority
   approval.
   1.2.6. Test or trial programs that deviate from munitions policy require Lead MAJCOM (or
   AFRC and NGB) and AF/A4LW approval. Refer to applicable 00-series T.Os and
   applicable 21-series instructions for routing, approval authorities and further guidance.
1.3. Compliance Terminology. For the purposes of this instruction, the following definitions
apply:
   1.3.1. Shall, Must, Will: Indicates a mandatory requirement. (Will is also used to express a
   declaration of purpose for a future event.)
   1.3.2. Should: Indicates a preferred method of accomplishment.

                                            Chapter 3

                        MUNITIONS PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

3.1. Conventional Munitions Serviceability and Product Assurance. Assurance of munitions
reliability is essential to effective air and ground operations in support of training and combat
missions. The key elements of munitions reliability are Aging and Surveillance (AGE/SURV)
testing, periodic surveillance inspections, specific event inspections (i.e., receipt, shipping,
special), and pre- or post-use inspections/testing. These processes ensure fielded munitions
systems perform according to design specification at the intended point-of-use. Suspect assets
are segregated prior to use, issue, or delivery.
   3.1.1. All squadrons with munitions activities, flights, and munitions-using organizations
   have key Product Assurance duties:
       3.1.1.1. Conduct and complete all scheduled and unscheduled munitions inspections as
       required by T.O.s and special instructions.
       3.1.1.2. Formally report all critical munitions issues that could lead to injury or prevent a
       munitions item from functioning properly to the MAJCOM, Lead MAJCOM, and the
       GACP. Report these issues using the GACP CRM. Additionally, use CAS; AF IMT
       191, Ammunition Disposition Request (ADR); Material Deficiency Report (MDR); SF
       Form 368, Product Quality Deficiency Report; safety reports, and the AFTO Form 22,
       Technical Manual (TM) Change Recommendation and Reply as applicable.
   3.1.2. 365-Day Assembled Munitions Serviceability Inspection. Conduct these inspections
   IAW T.O. 11A-1-63.
3.2. Non-expendable Air Munitions Training Items. MUNS/Flight supervision, user
(custodian), and maintenance personnel will ensure in-use inert and dummy training munitions
are maintained and functional to provide quality training.
   3.2.1. Units, managers, and custodians forecast for the minimum quantities of non-
   expendable air munitions required to provide realistic munitions production, maintenance,
   and weapons load crew training. Non-Expendable Air Munitions Training Authorizations
   are obtained on the AFMC2 site and IAW AFI 11-212, Munitions Requirements for Aircrew
   Training.
   3.2.2. The non-expendable training munitions standards provide basic requirements for
   weapons load crew, sortie generation operations, combat munitions maintenance training,
   nuclear weapon loading, maintenance, and handling training, exercises, evaluations,
   inspections, and competitions.
   3.2.3. Justifications referenced in other validated Air Force and Higher Headquarters
   directives that identify munitions requirements may be included in requirements
   forecasts and may exceed the Air Force standard requirements, if fully justified.
   3.2.4. Munitions custody accounts are set up with the Munitions Operations element and in
   CAS to requisition and manage allocations for training items. Training items managed
   within the munitions activity are maintained on the DoDAAC stock account and not issued to
   the custody account.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                31


      3.2.4.1. The UCML or equivalent document identifies types of munitions required for
      personnel to maintain proficiency. All in-use inert, dummy, or empty training munitions
      will mirror the parent munitions to the maximum extent possible.
      3.2.4.2. Major items (e.g., bombs, missiles) are painted like the parent (live) weapon
      with a blue band to identify them as inert IAW T.O. 11A-1-53, Identification of Empty
      and Inert Loaded Ammunition Items and Components.
   3.2.5. Munitions allocated to AETC Schoolhouse units and the 9th MUNS (AFCOMAC) are
   carried in CC-B in CAS. They are intended ‘for training use only’. Use of 1500 series tags
   to identify CC-B student munitions is not required. PGM configuration data for weapon
   systems tracked by Tactical Munitions Reporting System (TMRS), inspections, and TCTOs
   will be reported to the RAM Program Office quarterly using either TMRS or other products
   (i.e., Spreadsheet).
   3.2.5. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) The service provider will report all inspections, TCTOs or
   PGM configuration data on all assets in base stock. The 363 TRS will report all inspections,
   TCTOs or PGM configuration data on all assets allocated.
3.3. Reusable Container Management. Empty munitions and missile component containers
identified/coded as munitions managed items, including All Up Round (AUR) missile
containers, must be maintained on accountable records.
NOTE: ALCM, CALCM, and Advanced Cruise Missile (ACM) shipping and storage containers
will be managed IAW AFI 21-202, Vol 2. These containers are managed in Base Supply and
D035 accountable systems and are not managed in CAS.
   3.3.1. The GACP will maintain an Exempt Container List by National Stock Number (NSN)
   of containers that may be disposed of through the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)
   Disposition Services without requesting an ADR. This list will be posted on the GACP
   website (Serviceable Excess Index page; Container Index). The GACP stockpile office will
   review and update the list annually. However, the GACP may post changes, additions, or
   deletions at any time. If maintained in CAS, these containers will be on accountable records
   IAW this AFI.
   3.3.2. All stocklisted munitions containers, except those on the Exempt Container List, with
   a budget code of H, T, or U regardless of the Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability
   Category (ERRC) code will be managed in CAS IAW basic reparability data in the Indicative
   Data Record (IDR) file by specific container NSN, model number, and item T.O.
   3.3.2. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Maintain positive control over munitions containers if
   required to retain for mission/training purposes.
      3.3.2.1. After munitions assets are removed from accountable munitions
      containers/packaging, the owning or using organization (including munitions elements)
      will turn-in containers to the munitions activity.
      3.3.2.2. The munitions activity will pick-up containers on accountable records within 5
      duty-days after receipt.
      3.3.2.3. Organizations need not turn-in containers when munitions are removed for
      temporary maintenance/use.
32                            AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


  3.3.3. Empty accountable munitions containers/packaging (including outer and inner
  packaging materiel) will be maintained on the base DoDAAC to break down and/or
  repackage all built-up/assembled or complete round (CR) (GBUs, GP Bombs, Missile, etc.)
  until assets have been expended or turned-in. A Supplemental Allocation Authorization
  Request (SAAR) is not required for containers retained for built-up assets. Units will load
  Category (CAT) Code S level for these containers and validate requirements during the semi-
  annual 100-percent inventory.
  3.3.4. Serviceable non-accountable Special Packaging Instruction (SPI), Certification of
  Equivalency (COE), Competent Authority Approval (CAA), Department of Transportation
  Special Permit (DOT-SP), or equivalent containers that are not being utilized for shipment or
  storage of munitions within the MSA and that are excess to short term repack or other
  projected requirements will be managed in CAS as non-accountable assets. The term
  “drawing number” will be used when referring to SPI, COE, CAA, or equivalent numbers.
  This provides visibility of reusable containers throughout the Air Force.
     3.3.4.1. When entering container information, check “NSN Unknown” and enter the
     drawing number with no spaces (include dashes) as the lot number. Structure and
     location designators will be as identified in the unit’s Movement Control OI. Quantity
     will be the total container quantity for each drawing number, structure, and location
     combination. Remaining fields are at unit discretion.
     3.3.4.2. Update container quantities as changes occur.
     3.3.4.3. Units need not requisition to obtain an adequate quantity of repack containers
     when a reasonable expectation exists that assets will be expended or repack is not
     imminent.
  3.3.5. Non-accountable munitions containers/packaging will be maintained by the
  using/owning organization until assets are repackaged, consumed, expended.
     3.3.5.1. Non-accountable containers will be afforded appropriate storage and
     preservation to ensure they are available to repackage all on-hand assets.
     3.3.5.2. Using/owning organizations failing to maintain packaging will be financially
     liable for any local costs associated with obtaining replacement packaging.
  3.3.6. If munitions assets depart home station for TDY or deployment, expenditure
  notification will come from the gaining unit. If expenditures do not occur and empty outer
  containers and inner packaging materials are required at the deployed/TDY location to return
  built-up/assembled munitions back to original shipping configuration, the fund cite for the
  TDY or deployment will be utilized.
  3.3.7. Inspect, certify, and dispose of empty containers IAW T.O. 11A-1-60, General
  Instruction - Inspection of Reusable Munitions Containers and Scrap Material Generated
  From Items Exposed To, or Containing Explosives. Empty containers will be clearly marked,
  sealed, and segregated from other containers.
  3.3.8. Units will not auto ship containers (serviceable or unserviceable). If units incur
  storage space limitations request disposition using the GACP CRM.
  3.3.9. In addition to the above procedures, refer to AFI 20-110, Chapter 4 for packing,
  marking, and documentation procedures for reusable containers used with NWRM assets.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   33


3.4. Military Intermodal Containers (MILVANS) Management.
   3.4.1. These containers are used for the shipment and storage of conventional munitions.
   When an intermodal container governed by the International Organization for
   Standardization (ISO) is used for munitions storage, to include non-Air Force owned ISO
   containers, munitions inspection cycles will be extended to inside storage intervals as defined
   by specific item technical data. The 363 TRS and 9 MUNS (AFCOMAC) are exempt from
   the requirements in this paragraph.
   3.4.2. Approval from the NAF or MAJCOM munitions staff is required before a container
   can be used for anything other than its intended purpose. Utilizing Air Force owned
   containers for other uses is authorized by exception as a temporary solution and should not
   be considered a permanent fix for facility shortfalls.
   3.4.3. Units will maintain containers in serviceable condition for munitions redistribution or
   storage at all times. The Convention for Safe Containers (CSC) certification on all Air Force
   owned containers must be kept current. Maintenance, repair, and inspection of ISO
   containers are a PEC 28030 expense.
      3.4.3.1. Units will budget annually for container maintenance costs against PEC 28030.
          3.4.3.1.1. Maintenance is limited to AF owned containers, not DoD or commercial
          containers. Units perform general maintenance on AF owned ISOs. Contracts should
          only be established for tasks unable to be performed by the owning activity (certified
          welding, complete floor replacement, etc.)
          3.4.3.1.2. Maximum one-time and total repair costs will not exceed criteria provided
          in DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part VI, Management and
          Control of Intermodal Containers and System 463L Equipment, Chapter 604,
          Intermodal Container Inspection, Reinspection, Maintenance, And Repair. When
          repair cost exceeds DTR limits, request disposition instructions of APF containers
          from the GACP using the CRM. For MAJCOM-owned containers, request
          disposition instructions from the appropriate MAJCOM staff. Use ACAMS to
          determine ownership.
      3.4.3.2. Containers will not be used to store equipment or materials (e.g.: liquids, acids,
      batteries, etc.) that would render them non-certifiable under the CSC.
      3.4.3.3. Holes will not be made in any part of a container. Blocking and bracing must be
      accomplished IAW applicable Defense Ammunition Center (DAC) drawings available at
      the DAC website.
      3.4.3.4. Containers are designed to support their weight and that of their contents through
      bottom corner castings. When removed from a chassis, place containers on drained,
      hardstand surfaces with all four lower castings placed on blocks (dunnage) 4 to 6 inches
      high. This prevents rocks and debris from exerting pressure against lower structural
      members of the container and allows air circulation that will prevent moisture damage to
      the container. Containers may be temporarily placed directly on a paved hardstand for
      stuffing and unstuffing operations.
 34                            AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


          3.4.3.4.1. Empty containers will not be stacked more than three high. A minimum of
          two stacking/locking pins will be inserted in the counter-checked position on
          opposing corners when containers are stacked.
          3.4.3.4.2. Once containers have been inspected and verified empty, a numbered seal
          will be placed on each container to provide for security, integrity, and accountability.
      3.4.3.5. CSC Inspection: Performed by certified CSC inspectors IAW MIL-HDBK-
      138B, Container Inspection Handbook for Commercial and Military Intermodal
      Containers. For containers that pass inspection, apply a new DD Form 2282, Inspection
      Decal Convention for Safe Containers.
          3.4.3.5.1. Document the inspection using DA Form 2404, Equipment Inspection and
          Maintenance Worksheet. Complete and maintain the DA Form 2404 document IAW
          DTR 4500.9-R.
          3.4.3.5.2. The DA Form 2404 and most current Inspection Checklist for each ISO
          shall be uploaded/entered into ACAMS IAW DTR 4500.9, Part VI and AFI 24-203.
          3.4.3.5.3. The DAC conducts the in-resident CSC certification course. The distance
          learning course (Ammo-43-DL) is also available on the DAC website and is
          authorized for CSC initial and refresher training/certification for Air Force personnel.
   3.4.4. Account for AF owned ISO containers, ship ISO containers, and manage ISO
   container records in ACAMS IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part
   IV and AFI 24-203.
      3.4.4.1. CAS and AFMC2 will no longer be used for ISO accountability and
      maintenance management. All AF munitions activities that possess and maintain ISO
      containers shall transition AF owned ISO containers in their possession from CAS to
      ACAMS; and maintenance records from AFMC2 to ACAMS.
NOTE: Do not remove AF owned ISO containers from CAS or maintenance records from
AFMC2 until they are loaded into ACAMS and validated to be correct.
      3.4.4.2. Common User Fleet (CUF) and leased containers will be returned for reuse as
      soon as possible after removal of contents. If ownership of ISO containers cannot be
      determined locally, or using ACAMS, contact the AF Intermodal Container Manager
      (AFSC/LOET).
      3.4.4.3. When used to ship or store CAS managed munitions assets, load the ISO as
      container type “ISO” in CAS to allow Container-in-Container (CnC) management IAW
      paragraph 7.1.7.
3.5. Munitions Equipment Management.
   3.5.1. IMDS/G081 will be used in the munitions organization to manage inspection
   intervals, maintenance and inspection history, condition/status, and work performed on
   munitions and miscellaneous SE, Missile Test Sets, associated handling equipment (e.g.,
   slings, hoists). Specific SE terms are defined in T.O. 00-20-1, Appendix A. Definitions of
   SE, MMHE, Munitions Handling Equipment (MHE), and Locally Manufactured Equipment
   (LME) can be found in Attachment 1, Definitions and Terms.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    35


      3.5.1.1. In addition to documentation requirements of T.O. 00-20-1, units will update
      IMDS/G081 with gains, losses, maintenance, and TCTO actions as they occur.
      3.5.1.2. MHE and common equipment items that do not meet the definition of SE,
      MMHE, or LME with inspection or maintenance requirements (e.g., pallet jacks, lift
      jacks, dollies, and push carts) may be managed/tracked in AFMC2.
   3.5.2. Refer to T.O. 35D-1-2-CD-1, Munitions Material Handling and Support Equipment
   (Miscellaneous and Locally Manufactured) for maintenance, inspection, and servicing
   requirements for equipment items not identified in other specific item T.O.s.
   3.5.3. Support equipment without a listed Standard Reporting Designator (SRD) may load
   SRD “GAZ” for “Not Otherwise SRD Listed support equipment.”
   3.5.4. The Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) is the applicable system of
   record for all MMHE, Missile Test Sets, and associated support equipment. AFEMS
   maintains on-line equipment allowance standards for support equipment. Equipment
   custodians will maintain an AFEMS account and ensure all support equipment is accountable
   in AFEMS.
      3.5.4.1. Equipment custodians will ensure their Custodian Authorization/Custody
      Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) accurately reflects proper authorizations IAW AFEMS.
      Automated Test Systems (ATS) are entered into AFEMS by SN. Failure to reconcile
      discrepancies could result in the inability to order, replace, and mobilize munitions
      equipment. When equipment is moved, custodians coordinate with Logistics Readiness
      Squadron (LRS) to ensure it is appropriately transferred (1ET) or deployed (1ED) in
      SBSS/AFEMS.
          3.5.4.1.1. ‘Transfer’ accountability of equipment when movement is to a location
          with an established Expeditionary Logistics Readiness Squadron (ELRS) or host
          supply account at the gaining location.
          3.5.4.1.2. ‘Deploy’ equipment when the gaining location has no ELRS or host supply
          account, when movement is part of a peacetime exercise or training deployment.
      3.5.4.2. Contact the Equipment Accountability Element (EAE) or the Lead MAJCOM
      munitions staff to resolve account discrepancies. Air Reserve Component (ARC) units
      work through the HQ AFRC or NGB munitions staff for equipment issues. HQ AFRC or
      NGB will notify the EAE and should notify the appropriate Lead MAJCOM munitions
      staff.
3.6. Munitions Security.
   3.6.1. Risk Categories: Risk Categories and munitions storage and facility security criteria
   are IAW DoDM 5100.76, AFI 31-101, and Lead MAJCOM supplemental guidance to AFI
   31-101.
   3.6.2. General Guidance for Protecting Munitions Information: Many types of munitions
   information and data are useful to a potential enemy. Munitions data relating to specific
   plans, operations, and weapons system requirements within the Non-nuclear Consumable
   Annual Analysis (NCAA) and WCDO processes could be damaging to national security.
   The fact that this instruction identifies certain information as unclassified does not authorize
   automatic release of information. To have access to classified munitions information, one
36                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


  must have a security clearance at the appropriate level, a signed SF 312, Classified
  Information Nondisclosure Agreement, and the need-to-know.
     3.6.2.1. Release of Munitions Information to the Public or Foreign Entities.
         3.6.2.1.1. Public release of information. Public release of sensitive but unclassified
         (SBU) munitions information requires prior approval. Such information includes
         conversation, oral statement, speeches, articles, photographs, brochures,
         advertisements, displays, presentations, etc. Send proposed public disclosure, in
         writing, to the installation, major command, Air Logistics Complex, or HQ AF Public
         Affairs (SAF/PA) office for approval. Contractors, manufacturers and other
         government agencies are responsible for screening SBU munitions information
         submitted for release approval to ensure it is unclassified, technically accurate, and
         suitable for open publication. These activities are also responsible for written
         certification that the above criteria are met.
         3.6.2.1.2. Visits from public media representatives. Visits by public media shall be
         coordinated with and public release of any information officially approved by the
         appropriate (installation, MAJCOM, or HQ AF) PA before disclosure.
         3.6.2.1.3. Release of Classified or Unclassified Information to Foreign Entities. Any
         government or commercial agent receiving a request for release of conventional
         munitions information to a foreign government or individual must obtain approval.
         Approval shall be obtained IAW AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific And
         Technical Information, OPR of the applicable weapons specific security classification
         guide, and through an export license from the Department of State, Office of Defense
         Trade Control, PM/DTC, Washington DC 20522.
     3.6.2.2. Classification Challenges. Individuals who believe munitions information is
     inappropriately classified are expected to challenge the classification. Individuals should
     bring classification challenges and concerns to the attention of their security manager or
     the Original Classification Authority (OCA).
  3.6.3. How Munitions Information Classification is Determined: The rules expressed in
  Executive Order (E.O.) 12958 mandate that the OCA explicitly determines whether the
  unauthorized disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to result in damage
  to national security. The OCA must be able to identify and describe the damage. Munitions
  Information Classification Rules listed in Table 3.1, Munitions Information Classification
  Rules do not address all possible combinations of information, but serves as a guide.
     3.6.3.1. Security classification guides are developed IAW DoDM 5200.01, DoD
     Information Security Program: Overview, Classification, and Declassification, Vol. 1,
     Enclosure 6. The Program Manager (PM) will coordinate weapons-specific security
     classification guides affecting munitions or missile systems or their end-items with
     AF/A4LW and AF/A5R-C prior to publication or update. Weapon-specific security
     classification guides are posted on the GACP website. The Program Manager (PM) is
     responsible to keep Security Classification Guides current and posted on the GACP
     website. Weapon-specific security classification guides take precedence over security
     classification guidance in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2, General Classification Rules of this
     AFI.

       3.6.3.2. Three primary terms are used in munitions classification determination. Proper
       use of these terms will avoid unnecessary classification:
          3.6.3.2.1. Requirements. The NCAA and Tactical Air Missile Program (TAMP)
          documents calculate requirements for munitions to support unified commander
          missions under the methodology in DoDI 3000.04, DoD Munitions Requirements
          Process (MRP). The WCDO indicates the by base distribution of the NCAA and
          TAMP Combined Theater Requirement (CTR) data. Requirements are normally
          classified by the OCA using the logic rules outlined in the Table 3.1 and 3.2
          3.6.3.2.2. Allocations. The approved quantity of munitions items allocated to a
          command or theater based on a fair share of the stockpile. Allocations and associated
          requisitions are normally unclassified.
          3.6.3.2.3. Quantity. The on-hand amount of munitions available at any given time.
          Refer to the specific weapons classification guide for classification of quantity
          information. When items in the paragraphs below are not discussed or included, on-
          hand quantities are normally unclassified. On-hand quantities used in association
          with the items below shall be classified as SECRET or above.

3.8. Munitions Training Programs.
   3.8.1. General Training Requirements: Effective training programs in peacetime are critical
   to meeting deployment operations and surge combat requirements. Munitions managers and
   supervisors at all levels establish and implement training and qualification programs to
   enable technicians to proficiently perform assigned contingency and routine munitions
   systems tasks. Training focuses on management of assigned programs and qualification of
   supervisors and technicians to execute effective control, accountability, storage, receipt,
   shipment, inspection, maintenance, assembly, flightline delivery, and limited local
   disposition of conventional, precision guided, nuclear munitions, and associated components.
        3.8.1.1. Munitions training programs and training outlines will emphasize Combat
        Ammunition System operations, processing procedures, operation of Automated
        Identification Technology (AIT) equipment, and TMRS as applicable throughout the
        range of munitions operations. When developing local training programs, maximize use
        of the Munitions Accountability Procedures Guide located on the AFMC2 site.
        3.8.1.2. Munitions qualification training will focus on checkout, operation, and
        organizational level maintenance of assigned munitions tools, test, and handling
        equipment.
   3.8.2. Combat Munitions Training (CMT) Program. The CMT program is designed to
   provide hands-on familiarization training to develop core knowledge for all 2W0XX and
   company grade officers assigned to the MUNS/Munitions Flight. CMT is not intended to
   fully qualify personnel in all tasks. The unit's conventional munitions mission or OPLAN
   tasking (in-place or deployed) has primary emphasis in the CMT program and includes all
   facets of the munitions support mission, accountability, and CAS processes. CMT training
   will utilize standard CAS screens and CAS help screens to promote proficiency in CAS
   transaction processing. CMT programs should attempt to develop cross-functionality in the
   use of personnel to the maximum extent possible. For senior leaders in the unit (SMSgt,
   CMSgt, and Capt), CMT participation should focus on leadership, mentorship, hands-on

  review, and adaptation of the CMT curriculum at the point of instruction. Munitions
  Supervision is responsible for establishing and implementing an effective CMT program and
  directs the Training Section/Element NCOIC in all stages of program development.
  Munitions Supervision, supported by the Training Section and other workcenters shall:
     3.8.2.1. Develop a task-training list used to manage training for all contingency tasks and
     operations. The task-training list will identify the task to be instructed and the frequency
     (18 month maximum). Because supporting tasks are equally critical, the MUNS
     Superintendent/Flight Chief may designate personnel that only require CMT training on
     supporting tasks as identified on the task-training list. Additionally, determine the
     number of personnel (total number or percentage of assigned) required to train on each
     contingency task to meet the unit's most demanding contingency requirements. When
     developing the task training list, number of personnel to train, and frequency of training
     consider the following:
         3.8.2.1.1. The usage and type tasked munitions from the UCML, weapons task
         qualification listing, ITO, aircrew training syllabus, and OPLANs.
         3.8.2.1.2. Collateral mission tasking, MEP, and base support plans.
         3.8.2.1.3. The criticality of supporting tasks.
         3.8.2.1.4. The complexity, frequency, and duration of tasks performed.
         3.8.2.1.5. The need for flexibility in the use of personnel during contingency
         operations.
         3.8.2.1.6. The scheduling and the availability of personnel.
     3.8.2.2. Develop and coordinate CMT training outlines with Wing Safety and Quality
     Assurance (QA) (or equivalent) for ground/weapons safety adequacy and technical
     accuracy; the MASO to promote standardization of CAS tasks and processes; and with
     the local logistics/maintenance training flight to ensure the course curriculum and
     training outlines meet requirements of AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional Systems
     Development. As a minimum, training outlines will contain a training title, training
     objectives, student instructional material. Training resources, instructional method, and
     instructional guidance.

     3.8.2.3. Ensure all 2W0XX personnel assigned outside the Munitions Squadron/Flight
     attend CMT at intervals designated by the MUNS Superintendent/Flight Chief. This
     ensures munitions personnel retain familiarization on core munitions tasks and meet
     combat training requirements of the 2W0X1 Munitions Systems CFETP and training
     outlined by the Munitions Superintendent/Flight Chief in the Master Task Listing (MTL).

     This may only be waived by the individual’s Squadron Commander (or equivalent) for
     documented medical reasons.
     3.8.2.4. Manage exemption from CMT requirements as follows:
        3.8.2.4.1. Short-tour assignment locations when each member of the munitions
        organization receives a documented initial OPLAN briefing. Maintain OPLAN
        briefing documentation until personnel PCS.
        3.8.2.4.2. Units who primarily support Research, Development, Test and Evaluation
        (RDT&E) programs when the base of assignment lacks sufficient resources to mount
        an effective program.
     3.8.2.5. Certify completion of individual CMT training requirements when it can be
     positively established through training records and/or other deployed documentation that
     training received or activities conducted while deployed to a contingency location
     satisfies the CMT requirements identified for an individual or assigned duty section.
     3.8.2.6. Ensure that CAS access is controlled and monitored until training is complete,
     documented, and access granted by a System Administrators (SA).
     3.8.2.7. ARC unit CMT programs are separate and distinct training programs. However,
     ARC units should collaborate with their gaining commands/units to maximize the
     effectiveness of their CMT program. Total Force Integration (TFI) units should develop
     and maintain a single consolidated CMT program on each installation.

        components IAW T.O. 11A-1-63 and/or the specific item T.O. (-63 are preferred).
        3.8.2.10.5. Review of vehicle, AGE, SE, MMHE, TMDE, test set, and special tool
        specification, use, and operational maintenance requirements for each type
        build/operating locations.
        3.8.2.10.6. Review of requirements and procedures for munitions security and
        storage.
     3.8.2.11. Units will use IMDS/G081 to track CMT.
     3.8.2.12. Plan CMT training so that practical training normally begins when academic
     training is complete. Practical training is administered by qualified and appointed CMT
     Instructors. Conduct CMT in facilities or training areas usually dedicated to the
     munitions assembly or support operation being instructed and will include:
        3.8.2.12.1. Use of facilities large enough to accommodate required training and
        associated SE.
        3.8.2.12.2. Use of a practical training area with adequate office space and an
        academic classroom with appropriate heating and cooling.
        3.8.2.12.3. Maximum duplication of realistic operating conditions to enhance
        training. Additional munitions practical training considerations for munitions
        include:
44                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


            3.8.2.12.3.1. Familiarity with munitions serviceability criteria. Do not allow
            blanket rejection of training munitions during training operations solely because
            they are inert.
            3.8.2.12.3.2. Familiarity with the operation of all available MMHE, AGE, and SE
            used during operations. Pay particular attention to equipment not used on a
            routine basis. This training focuses on handling, utilization, and loading
            procedures to include loading in/out of containers.
            3.8.2.12.3.3. Training must emphasize set-up for mass assembly and innovate
            production techniques and organization (i.e., use of the Munitions Assembly
            Conveyor (MAC), trailer builds, dunnage builds), use of power tools, and on-the-
            spot maintenance procedures (i.e., use of thread chasers, alignment devices). As a
            minimum, this phase includes:
                3.8.2.12.3.3.1. Physical inspection of components according to T.O. 11A-1-
                63 or specific item T.O.. Use T.O. 11A-1-63 if it includes inspection
                procedures.
                3.8.2.12.3.3.2. Use of inert components for this training is recommended. If
                inert components are not available, live munitions may be used provided
                serviceability is not jeopardized and technical data or MAJCOM does not
                prohibit use.
            3.8.2.12.3.4. Units with an alternate mission as specified in an approved
            Organizational Mission Directive (OMD) (i.e., TARRP) will ensure training
            reflects applicable tasks.
  3.8.3. Munitions Inspector Training:
     3.8.3.1. To become a certified Munitions Inspector (not a trainer), any active duty, air
     national guard, or reserve 2W051, 2W071, or 2W091 munitions technician/supervisor,
     federal civilian, or federally employed contractor may be trained, qualified/certified, and
     appointed as a Munitions Inspector at the discretion of the Munitions Flight Chief (or
     DoD civilian/contractor equivalent). To become certified, they must complete
     Munitions Inspector Training and Certification using the USAF Qualification Training
     Package (AFQTP) for Munitions Inspector Training and Certification located on the
     AFMC2 SharePoint Site and any local requirements (e.g., Senior Inspector Assessment,
     Quality Assurance evaluations). There is no specific training duration or experience
     requirement unless otherwise stated in this AFI, the Munitions Inspector AFQTP, or local
     guidance.
         3.8.3.1.1. Units may include an addendum to the munitions inspector AFQTP to
         address local inspector requirements or processes. However, the basic AFQTP will
         not be changed or deviated from without approval of the 2W0X1 Air Force Career
         Field Manager (AFCFM).
         3.8.3.1.2. Submit proposed changes to the munitions inspector AFQTP through their
         Lead MAJCOM to the 2W0X1 AFCFM for approval prior to implementation.
     3.8.3.2. Civilian personnel hired from any other military service with Quality Assurance
     Specialist, Ammunition Surveillance (QASAS) experience (GS-1910 series rating) may

       be appointed as a Munitions Inspector provided they meet the training, qualification and
       appointment criteria of paragraph 3.8.3.1 and possess at least four years experience in
       an ordnance or munitions career field/job series/position (e.g., civilian munitions worker,
       Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD); Naval, Army, USMC Ordnance, Aircraft
       Armament, Nuclear, or ICBM Munitions).
       3.8.3.3. Document certification in the Training Business Area (TBA), Individual
       Training Program (ITP) journal entry, AF IMT 623A, AF IMT 1098, IMDS/G081, or
       other suitable documentation, standardized across the unit.
       3.8.3.4. Utilize a ‘Train-the-Trainer’ concept to locally train and certify munitions
       inspectors. To become certified as a Munitions Inspector Trainer, the following
       requirements must be met:
          3.8.3.4.1. Active duty, air national guard, and reserve personnel must hold AFSC
          2W071, Munitions Technician/Supervisor (or above) and hold SEI 836.
          3.8.3.4.2. Federal civilian and federally employed contractor personnel must meet the
          SEI 836 qualification requirements.
NOTE: Federal civilian and federally employed contractor personnel are not eligible for award
of and AFSC, skill levels, or and SEI.
       3.8.3.5. Active duty, air national guard, and reserve personnel may be awarded SEI 836
       be competing Specialty Training Standard (STS) qualification, completion of all training
       objectives outlined in the AFQTP for Munitions Inspection Qualification and
       Certification, 8 months of hands-on munitions inspection experience in any munitions
       workcenter, and the supervisor‘s recommendation.
       3.8.3.6. The senior munitions inspector must hold SEI 836, and have either 2 years
       continuous munitions inspector experience within the past 48 months or have attended
       the AETC in-resident or Mobile Training Team (MTT) course within the past 48 months.
       When inspector experience and course attendance cannot be met, the Flight Chief will
       appoint the most experienced person holding SEI 836 and ensure they attend a formal
       inspector training course within 1-year of appointment. The senior munitions inspector is
       an approved inspector trainer regardless of meeting inspector trainer requirements.
   3.8.4. NWRM Training: All personnel that are assigned NWRM duties will receive NWRM
   training IAW AFI 20-110 prior to handling any NWRM.
3.9. Static Display Munitions (SDM) and Inactive/Obsolete EOD Training Munitions
Procedures.
   3.9.1. These procedures apply to both SDM and Inactive/Obsolete EOD training items,
   unless specified otherwise.
   3.9.2. SDM may be placed on permanent, fixed static display around an MSA and
   installation to build esprit de corps and to improve overall appearance. This does not include
   inert munitions used for open houses, Ammunition CAPSTONE Course, change of command
   ceremonies, static display munitions approved through the AF Museum Program, or in a
   training environment. The Flight Chief may approve the use of existing inert trainers for
   temporary static displays IAW AFMAN 91-201 and applicable item T.O.

  3.9.3. Inactive/Obsolete EOD training munitions may be retained only by EOD for
  continued proficiency training.       HQ Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency
  (AFCESA/CEXD) will establish accountability procedures and coordinate with the
  applicable Air Logistics Complex (ALC) on assets in this category. These assets are not
  SDM and will not be used for static display purposes.
  3.9.4. The condition and appearance of SDM is a reflection of the Air Force, individual
  units, and the munitions community, and must be maintained in superior condition.
     3.9.4.1. At least annually, organizations with approved SDM will visually inspect items
     for overall appearance and for platform mounting security and safety. Documentation of
     SDM inspections will be maintained within the SDM package with a copy of the ADR
     that authorized use of the SDM. Document SDM inspections as follows:
         3.9.4.1.1. Documentation of SDM inspections prior to 1 January 2013 may be
         retained on locally developed forms/e-forms.
         3.9.4.1.2. SDM inspections performed after 30 September 2013 will be documented
         using AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical Data IAW TO 00-20-1, and as follows:
            3.9.4.1.2.1. Block 3: SDM identifier.
            3.9.4.1.2.2. Column A: Date of inspection.
            3.9.4.1.2.3. Column B:         Remarks; note visible deterioration, mounting
            security/safety issues, and corrective actions taken.
            3.9.4.1.2.4. Column     C:    Unit,     printed   rank/name,   and   signature   of
            inspector/technician.
     3.9.4.2. Higher Headquarters may direct units to remove SDM if not maintained in a
     fitting condition and appearance.
  3.9.5. Only unserviceable, non-repairable, and worldwide excess inert/empty certified
  munitions will be approved as SDM.
  3.9.6. Approved SDM items will be permanently stamped or etched with a unit specific
  SDM identifier number consisting of the acronym “SDM”, unit DoDAAC, and a 3-digit
  number assigned by the unit in numerical sequence. EXAMPLE: The first request from
  Osan AB, Korea for three inert MK-82s (BLU-111) would be marked SDM-FV5284-001
  through SDM-FV5284-003.
  3.9.7. All SDMs will be secured to prevent removal of the CR or any attached sub-
  components.
  3.9.8. Request Procedures.
     3.9.8.1. When an asset requested for SDM or Inactive/Obsolete EOD training is on the
     munitions DoDAAC, the MASO must submit an ADR to the appropriate ALC requesting
     authorization. Assets obtained by an organization without coordination through the local
     Munitions Flight will be the responsibility of that organization.
     3.9.8.2. The following statements will be made (as appropriate) in the ‘Reason for
     Reporting’ block:
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                47


         3.9.8.2.1. For SDM: “Request the munitions items listed on this document be
         retained for static display. I certify the munitions listed are unserviceable, non-
         repairable for operational use, and free of explosives and explosive residue. The
         munitions will be marked SDM-FVXXXX-001 through SDM-FVXXXX-999 and
         placed on permanent, fixed static display within 90 calendar days of receipt of
         approval. This action has been coordinated through Munitions Supervision.”
         3.9.8.2.2. For Inactive/Obsolete EOD training: “Request the munitions items listed
         on this document be inventory adjusted off record and provided to EOD. Items have
         been declared inactive/obsolete by the AF for operational use and will not be
         maintained in the active inventory. I certify the munitions listed are free of
         explosives and explosive residue.”
     3.9.8.3. All unserviceable defects will be listed on the ADR.
     3.9.8.4. The ADR will specifically identify the requesting organization. If approved, this
     organization will be the owning organization and will be responsible for the inspection,
     appearance, and maintenance of the item. The owning user will forward documentation
     of annual inspections to the MASO. The MASO will file latest inspection documentation
     with the original SDM paperwork.
     3.9.8.5. The Product Team Item Manager (IM) and Equipment Specialist (ES) will
     review requests, make worldwide excess stock (SDM/EOD items) and/or non-repairable
     determinations (SDM only), and recommend approval/disapproval to the PM. The PM
     will approve/disapprove the request.
     3.9.8.6. If approved, munitions will be inventory adjusted from accountable records by
     the MASO. SDM will be tracked by ADR and SDM number by the Munitions Flight.
     EOD items will be managed and tracked by the EOD unit IAW procedures established by
     HQ AFCESA/CEXD.
         3.9.8.6.1. The ADR will be the sole proof of authorization to adjust accountable
         records. No other supporting documentation is required.
         3.9.8.6.2. The SDM display location (e.g., entry to bldg XXX, MSA Main gate, static
         display aircraft at west gate) will be annotated on all copies of the approved ADR and
         updated as changes occur. SDMs owned by the Munitions Flight shall be managed in
         the CAS, Non-accountable Program (AM101A).
         3.9.8.6.3. SDM not placed on permanent display within the specified 90 calendar day
         timeframe will again be reported on AF IMT 191, ADR for final disposition.
  3.9.9. Final Disposition.
     3.9.9.1. SDM removed from display will be returned to accountable records using an
     Organizational Turn-in (ORG TIN) according to paragraph 7.19.1.1 and reported on an
     ADR for final disposition. SDM numbers will be reported for each item removed from
     static display.
     3.9.9.2. Inactive/Obsolete EOD training items may be retained as serviceable as long as
     they serve their intended purpose and do not present a safety hazard or reduce training
     capability.
 48                              AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


         3.9.9.3. Inactive/Obsolete EOD training items no longer used for training will be
         disposed of IAW DoD 4160.28-M Vol. 2, Defense Demilitarization: Demilitarization
         Coding by the owning EOD organization.
      3.9.10. Historical/Archival Records.
         3.9.10.1. For SDM: The Munitions organization, owning organization, and GACP will
         maintain copies of original ADRs for the entire period munitions are on static display.
         3.9.10.2. For Inactive/Obsolete EOD items: AFCESA/CEXD and the owning EOD
         organization will establish procedures to properly utilize, account, document, and dispose
         of these assets.
3.10. Missile and PGM Management.
   3.10.1. Management of AUR Missiles:
         3.10.1.1. Do not convert AUR missiles to CRs in CAS.
         3.10.1.2. Ready-use missiles (e.g., out of containers and loaded on trailers/racks for
         immediate use) will be managed in CAS by NSN and SN.
NOTE: Missiles out of containers for maintenance are not considered ‘Ready-Use’.
         3.10.1.3. Bulk stock AUR missiles may be managed in CAS by pseudo lot or SN at unit
         option. MAJCOMs may direct use of either pseudo lot or SN for bulk stock AUR
         missiles.
         3.10.1.4. For bulk stock AUR missiles, warehouse labels will not be applied to floor
         location markers and local standardized location markings will be used. Place the
         warehouse labels for each missile container on the humidity indicator side of the
         container.
   3.10.2. General Missile Management: Unserviceable components will be shipped to depot
   facilities, using priority 02 and CC-F. The GACP may approve less than QUP after
   coordination with appropriate PM. WSEP Program missile components will be shipped
   priority 05.
   3.10.3. Air Intercept Missile (AIM) - 9M Procedures.
         3.10.3.1. Units do not requisition AIM-9M AUR missiles including AIM-9M Captive
         Air Training Missiles (CATMs). The GACP (Robins AFB) distributes AIM-9M AUR
         missiles based on approved allocations. If needed to support CATM allocations, units
         may requisition the Missile Body Section (MBS) and Guidance Control Section (GCS) to
         build-up the CATM. In this case, unit places the following remarks in the requisition
         'Comments' field: FYXX Alloc CATM New Build.
         3.10.3.2. If on-hand quantity of serviceable GCSs is less than the allocated AUR and
         CATM quantity, requisition replacement GCSs based on the number of unserviceable
         GCSs shipped to depot or manufacturer using priority 02. Place the Transportation
         Control Number (TCN) and quantity of shipped GCSs in CC-F in the 'Comments' field
         (i.e., 4 EA FV0003 7329 7503, F). GCSs will be shipped in QUP.
NOTE: AIM-9M GCS requisitions are limited by the AIM-9M AUR, CATM, and GCS asset
posture. Only the AUR and CATM are allocated.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                             49


     3.10.3.3. Units will maintain CATM-9s by the CATM-9 NSN.
  3.10.4. Component Replacement Procedures. Manage replacement components as follows:
     3.10.4.1. If a spare replacement component is in stock, remove and replace the
     component, process a CC/identity change for the unserviceable component and update
     records in TMRS. Follow documentation procedures for Stockpile Consumption Issues
     and TIN.
     3.10.4.2. If no replacement component is in stock requisition IAW with paragraph
     3.10.2.
        3.10.4.2.1. Units are not required to segregate donor missiles within individual
        containers. Do not change the donor AUR to a stubby NSN. Change the donor
        missile to CC-G and attach the appropriate 15XX series tag to the missile and
        container. EXAMPLE: If four CC-A missiles are in a container and a component is
        removed from one of the missiles, place the affected missile in CC-G, apply the
        appropriate 15XX series tag, and return to the same container.
        3.10.4.2.2. Process an ORG TIN for the unserviceable component and requisition a
        replacement component IAW paragraph 7.7.
        3.10.4.2.3. Change the CC of the AUR and update records in TMRS.
     3.10.4.3. When no replacement assets are available, process a Consumption Issue using
     DIFM to Organization/Shop (ORG/SHP) 002SM which will generate a due-out.
        3.10.4.3.1. TIN the unserviceable component from the AUR using DIFM TIN
        procedures against the DIFM due-out document IAW paragraph 7.19.1.4.
        3.10.4.3.2. Change the AUR to CC-G and update TMRS records.
        3.10.4.3.3. Once QUP is reached, if required, ship unserviceable components.
        3.10.4.3.4. Process requisition for serviceable replacement components. Ensure the
        TCN and quantity of shipped CC-F components is placed in the 'Comments' field
        (i.e., 4 EA FV0003 7329 7503, F).
        3.10.4.3.5. Upon receipt of replacement component(s), perform a Due-Out Release
        against the due-out DIFM document to ORG/SHP 002SM, change CC, and update
        records in TMRS.
  3.10.5. Acceleration Monitoring Device/Assembly (AMD/AMA) Management.
     3.10.5.1. AMD and associated components will not be managed or tracked in CAS.
     These assets are DLA managed and will be requisitioned through Base Supply using
     O&M funding.
     3.10.5.2. An AUR AMA is created when mating a CAS managed and stock listed
     Missile Body Assembly (MBA) with a DLA managed and SBSS stock listed AMD.
     3.10.5.3. When an MBA has been mated to an AMD, use the appropriate (grey or
     orange) AUR AMA NSN to process a selective identity change in CAS.
     3.10.5.4. Units will not maintain AMD not in AUR AMA configuration.               Upon
     disassembly, turn in all excess AMD to the Base Supply.
 50                            AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


       3.10.5.5. AMD maintenance is limited to the procedures of T.O. 11G14-4-11, Field
       Level Maintenance Accelerator Monitoring Assembly (AMA).
   3.10.6. Units are not authorized to fly tactical missiles unless authorized by AFI 11-214, Air
   Operations Rules and Procedures.
3.11. WRM Munitions Program Element Code PEC 28030.
   3.11.1. Units with PEC 28030 requirements develop and submit budget forecasts per AFI
   25-101 for inclusion in the base financial plan.
   3.11.2. After PEC 28030 funds are allocated, Commanders of munitions activities,
   munitions supervision and the MASO closely monitor fund expenditure to ensure fulfillment
   of WRM munitions maintenance requirements.
3.12. Disposition of Munitions.
   3.12.1. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). To meet current and future
   mission requirements, the munitions management program must incorporate protection of the
   environment as a national priority. Federal and State laws and regulations establish
   requirements for management and disposal of Waste Military Munitions (WMM).
   Applicable federal law includes the EPA MMR (40 C.F.R. Subpart M). WMM are military
   munitions designated by the appropriate AF Designated Disposition Authority (DDA) as no
   longer acceptable for any useful purpose, or determined by EOD as requiring a Level 1 or 2
   emergency responses. Disposal of these items is then directed by the Installation
   Commander. All WMM management activities shall consult with the base environmental
   function to determine the laws applicable at that base and comply with those laws.
   OCONUS locations must follow the MMR environmental requirements in this AFI unless
   conflicts exist with the following: Host-nation final governing standards, DoD Overseas
   Environmental Baseline Guidance Document, and Status of Forces Agreements.
       3.12.1.1. The MMR amended Federal RCRA regulations requiring WMM to be managed
       as a hazardous waste. The MMR is a federal standard, not a national standard and the
       State can either adopt the MMR or choose to enact a state MMR regulation that is more
       stringent than the Federal regulation. Each base (led by its environmental function) must
       determine the extent of state (or territory) adoption and compare it to EPA’s MMR and
       DoD implementation policy of the MMR.
       3.12.1.2. The EPA’s MMR establishes Federal requirements for obtaining a conditional
       exemption from regulating WMM as a RCRA hazardous waste. One of the requirements
       for obtaining the federal conditional exemption is managing WMM IAW Department of
       Defense Explosive Safety Board (DDESB) rules. If a State has adopted its own MMR,
       the State MMR will determine if a conditional exemption is available and the
       requirements for obtaining it. When a state has adopted its own rules for obtaining a
       conditional exemption, DDESB rules must also be followed. Non-compliance could
       result in fines or even criminal penalties for known violations. To the fullest extent
       possible, the base should coordinate with all DoD components within the state or territory
       to assure the MMR is being managed in a consistent manner.
       3.12.1.3. Bases can be EPA or state authorized for treatment of WMM as RCRA
       hazardous waste in specified Open Burn/Open Detonation (OB/OD) units. Where a
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                 51


     treatment permit has been issued or interim status pre-permitting authorization obtained
     by the base, WMM shall be managed IAW the EPA/state permit or interim status rules.
     3.12.1.4. Non-compliance with RCRA Federal or State laws, whichever is most
     stringent, can result in fines or penalties to include criminal penalties for known
     violations. WMM activities shall be conducted in compliance with all applicable
     environmental requirements.
  3.12.2. Conventional munitions, missiles, and their components are managed IAW this AFI
  and retained in the Air Force inventory as long as there is a requirement and the assets are
  serviceable, economically repairable, or recoverable. Units shall not identify unused military
  munitions as hazardous waste until authorization from an AF DDA, EOD, or installation
  commander has been secured indicating that the munitions cannot be put into serviceable
  condition and cannot be recycled or used for other purposes. Once a determination is made
  by an authorized military official, units shall comply with all applicable environmental
  requirements.
  3.12.3. Where proposed or effective state law or a proposed or existing RCRA permit
  condition is determined to exceed or conflict with the policy contained in this AFI or
  AFMAN 91-201, the installation environmental and legal offices shall first attempt to resolve
  the administrative conflict through consultation and/or permit modifications with the state
  authority. The installation shall comply with all applicable environmental laws and permit
  conditions pending resolution of the conflict.
     3.12.3.1. Disputes with state/local regulators must be referred at once to installation
     environmental and legal offices for possible resolution.
     3.12.3.2. In resolving conflicts, life protection will be the primary concern of the
     decision-maker and AFMAN 91-201 standards will remain in effect pending resolution.
  3.12.4. Disposition of Recovered Items: Response Level 1, Level 2, Emergency, and
  Routine.
     3.12.4.1. The responsibility to consider safety begins at the lowest level, and the
     authority to deal with a problem as an immediate response begins with the munitions
     handler.
     3.12.4.2. An AF DDA is the only approval authority for disposition of military munitions
     items as WMM. EOD response specialists conduct level 1 and 2 emergency responses.
     Hazardous munitions items designated by EOD as Level 1 or Level 2 do not require
     DDA approval prior to disposal. EOD response specialists will contact the base
     Environmental Function to ensure all state requirements are met prior to disposal.
         3.12.4.2.1. The DDA for conventional munitions other than Air Superiority Missiles
         (ASM) is the GACP (Hill AFB).
         3.12.4.2.2. The DDA for ASM is the GACP (Robins AFB).
     3.12.4.3. When the EOD response specialist determines that munitions requires an
     ‘IMMEDIATE RESPONSE (Level 1)’ (e.g. not safe to transport or store), or that a
     munitions item requires an ‘IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT
     RESPONSE (Level 2)’ (e.g. the item can be transported and temporarily stored awaiting
     state notification or permits), request for disposition from a DDA is not necessary.
52                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


        3.12.4.3.1. If as a result of a level 2 emergency, a munitions item is turned over to the
        military installation for temporary storage, the EOD specialist will annotate
        “IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT RESPONSE (Level 2)”
        on the FOB Turn-in document.
        3.12.4.3.2. The munitions activity or EOD will immediately request that the
        installation environmental function obtain the necessary permits or oral authorization
        from Federal, State and/or Local authorities. Oral authorizations must be documented
        and the installation must follow-up with the agency to assure a complete record is
        maintained.
        3.12.4.3.3. If the state environmental regulatory agency (or host nation equivalent)
        grants an emergency disposal permit or authorization, items will be disposed of IAW
        emergency disposal procedures. If an emergency disposal permit or authorization is
        not granted, the installation environmental and legal offices will immediately elevate
        the issue to the MAJCOM munitions staff and environmental offices and the regional
        AF environmental office for resolution. Annually, the munitions activity will request
        EOD to re-evaluate munitions from Level 2 emergencies that are in prolonged storage
        to ensure they have not become an immediate hazard (e.g., Level 1 emergency
        response).
     3.12.4.4. When the EOD response specialist declares that recovered munitions do not or
     no longer require emergency action (ROUTINE-Not Level 1 or 2), and the munitions are
     returned to the military installation for storage, then the EOD response specialist will
     annotate “ROUTINE” on the FOB turn-in document.
        3.12.4.4.1. Munitions personnel will request disposition from a DDA.
        3.12.4.4.2. Munitions found off base that are declared ROUTINE - NOT Level 1 or
        Level 2, have unknown storage history, or are rendered/declared safe by EOD, will be
        evaluated from a storage and transportation aspect by the appropriate DDA for
        disposition determination.
     3.12.4.5. The EOD response specialist determines the need for disposal or destruction of
     munitions or explosives that constitutes an immediate danger to human life or property.
     Coordination and approval of emergency disposal or destruction actions is established
     locally per safety and EOD procedures.
        3.12.4.5.1. The MASO shall notify the appropriate program management team using
        the GACP CRM, and Lead MAJCOM via e-mail, when stock-listed munitions or
        explosives are found to be immediately dangerous and the condition is not a result of
        misuse or mishandling.
            3.12.4.5.1.1. Appropriate production lot suspension or restriction actions must be
            assessed or initiated by the Product Team/Integrated Product Team (PT/IPT)
            through the appropriate ES or PM after disposal actions/decisions.
            3.12.4.5.1.2. The PT/IPT will take prompt action to advise users that the lot has
            been restricted or suspended in CMRS.
        3.12.4.5.2. If munitions personnel have any questions or doubts about the safety of
        munitions assets, contact your supporting EOD unit.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                 53


          3.12.4.5.3. Once EOD personnel have determined that the response can be delayed
          without compromising safety or increasing the risk to human health, follow the
          Imminent and Substantial Endangerment Response (Level 2) instructions in the EPA
          MMR implementation procedures.
          3.12.4.5.4. The installation should ensure procedures are established with the
          appropriate environmental regulatory agencies in advance that enable EOD to quickly
          and effectively respond to EOD declared Level 1 and 2 responses without delay or
          further risk to human life or property.
       3.12.4.6. Each installation must assure that a partnership is established between the
       environmental office, Judge Advocate (JA), EOD, and the munitions organization to plan
       and implement the EPA MMR, installation strategy, and to resolve any munitions-related
       environmental concerns at the lowest level. The installation environmental office is
       responsible to chair the meetings, establish the agenda, and provide meeting minutes to
       all members.
       3.12.4.7. In addition to level 1, level 2, emergency, and routine EOD responses, IAW
       AFI 10-801, Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA), when directed under
       Immediate Response Authority (IRA) situations, Air Force officials, including local
       military commanders, may be directed/required to provide EOD support to domestic local
       civilian law enforcement agencies.
          3.12.4.7.1. When DSCA support includes EOD assistance to civil authorities to
          mitigate, render safe, and dispose of hazardous military explosives items and other
          improvised explosive devices (IED), these assets should not normally be returned to
          the MSA, unless directed by higher authority.
          3.12.4.7.2. Requests from civil authorities for non-immediate EOD support (e.g.,
          materials that are unrelated to DoD origin, or appear not to be of DoD origin) will be
          subject to approval by the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF). Examples of non-
          immediate DoD EOD support include, but are not limited to, use of DoD materials,
          equipment, and use of AF munitions storage facilities.
   3.12.5. Disposition of Excess Munitions.
       3.12.5.1. DELETED.
       3.12.5.2. Serviceable excess will be reported via the automated serviceable excess
       program on the GACP website. Refer to the User's Guide posted under the serviceable
       excess link.
NOTE: MASOs should only report MSRG serviceable excess if unique circumstances exist
(e.g., mission changes, Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), construction projects that impact
capacity, loss of NEW).
          3.12.5.2.1. Do not report MSRG excess if current allocations or future requirements
          exist.
          3.12.5.2.2. OCONUS units must obtain MAJCOM concurrence before reporting
          MSRG excess.
   3.12.6. Disposition of DoD Stock-listed Munitions.
54                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


     3.12.6.1. When DoD stock-listed conventional munitions, missiles, and related explosive
     components become unserviceable at base level, the intent of the DoD is to ship assets to
     the appropriate location for further evaluation/screening for recycling and other utility
     before final disposition.
     3.12.6.2. Processing ADR.
        3.12.6.2.1. The munitions inspector will initiate and the MASO will approve,
        forward, or deleted the ADR in CAS.
        3.12.6.2.2. After receiving an ADR, the DDA will provide disposition instructions to
        the initiator within 60 calendar days. If disposition instructions are not received
        within 60 calendar days the MASO or designated representative shall follow-up using
        the GACP CRM until disposition instructions are received.
        3.12.6.2.3. Units may print to file the ADR document to capture disposition
        instructions.
        3.12.6.2.4. The ADR transaction in CAS will be finalized by the MASO after
        receiving instructions from the DDA.
     3.12.6.3. Policy for implementation of the EPA MMR states that only a DDA may
     designate munitions as waste.
        3.12.6.3.1. For the Air Force, the PT/IPT evaluates and recommends actions to the
        DDA. The DDAs are designated in writing by the Product Group Manager and have
        final disposition authority.
        3.12.6.3.2. The DDA response to an ADR will either direct shipment to another
        location for further evaluation/screening for Resource Recovery and Recycling (R3)
        or designate the munitions as waste and direct shipment to an EPA permitted or
        interim status OB/OD unit.
        3.12.6.3.3. If the ship to location is an Army Depot, the DDA will furnish the
        appropriate address. The MASO must assure this address is included in the
        supplementary address (blocks 45-50) of the shipping document.
     3.12.6.4. If the DDA directs shipment to another installation, the originating MASO
     must assure compliance.
        3.12.6.4.1. If the DDA has no alternative disposition for the munitions, the base will
        receive notification to dispose.
            3.12.6.4.1.1. Base munitions personnel will segregate waste munitions from
            serviceable/unserviceable assets.
            3.12.6.4.1.2. Waste munitions must be clearly marked. Such identification may
            be by individual unit, pallet load, igloo, etc.
            3.12.6.4.1.3. Separate storage facilities are not required for munitions designated
            as waste provided that all requirements of EPA’s MMR or applicable state law are
            met and DDESB standards are followed.
            3.12.6.4.1.4. ADRs will be initiated on unserviceable CC-H/CC-P assets upon
            inspector classification. Once disposition instructions have been provided, units
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  55


             may accumulate assets for quarterly consolidated shipments unless otherwise
             directed on the ADR.
NOTE: Submit ADR for CC-F assets only when no repair DoDAAC is available in CAS.
Submit ADR for CC-E/CC-G assets when they are excess to requirements or repair
capability/resource constraints indefinitely prevent maintenance.
          3.12.6.4.2. The EPA’s MMR provides that munitions which are stored in compliance
          with all requirements of the rule, including the requirement to meet DDESB
          standards, are not considered ‘waste’ by EPA until the munitions leave the magazine
          door en route to a non-military owned or operated treatment, storage, or disposal
          facility.
          3.12.6.4.3. The EPA (RCRA) MMR provides that munitions that are deteriorated or
          damaged to the point that the munitions cannot be put into serviceable condition, and
          cannot reasonably be recycled or used for other purposes, are WMM while in storage.
          When deteriorated or damaged munitions are identified, base munitions personnel
          should notify the Environmental Function to determine if the state or territory has
          adopted the MMR Conditional Exemption for storage and to ensure the required
          regulatory notifications are made. If the Conditional Exemption is not available, the
          supporting EOD unit should be contacted to address the WMM as an emergency
          response (Level 1 or Level 2).
      3.12.6.5. Unserviceable and non-repairable inert munitions items and accessories with
      DEMIL code other than ‘F’ and valued at $500 or less per item, which cannot be used for
      local training, may be approved for disposal by the MASO using the CAS ADR process.
      Disposal will be IAW DoD 4160.21-M, Defense Materiel Disposition Manual, DoD
      4160.28-M Vol. 2, and DoD 4160.28-M Vol. 3, Defense Demilitarization: Procedural
      Guidance. Refer to AFI 20-110 for disposition of NWRM assets.
      3.12.6.6. Unserviceable, inert munitions items and accessories with DEMIL code ‘F’,
      valued at $500 or over may have utility as spare parts and related historical data could be
      used for trend analysis. Submit ADR in CAS to the DDA.
   3.12.7. Disposition of DoD Non-Stock-listed Munitions.
      3.12.7.1. MASOs may authorize local disposition of research, development, test and
      evaluation assets or excess items that have been used in research and development
      projects/tests if project managers cannot return them to an original configuration (L10
      stock-listed items). Project managers are responsible for providing disposition
      instructions and for all costs associated with disposal.
      3.12.7.2. Assets subjected to temperature treatment, vibration, or impact testing
      (regardless of stock-listed status) will not be returned for issue or redistribution. Such
      items are inherently unsafe.
      3.12.7.3. After a non-stock-listed munitions item has been used/considered for use in a
      test or evaluation program, the asset will be evaluated to determine its safety and proper
      identification. Project managers are responsible for costs associated with obtaining
      proper safety/identification evaluation if this cannot be determined by local agencies.
56                            AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


         3.12.7.3.1. If assets cannot be properly identified, meet Hazard Classification (HC)
         requirements, Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements, or otherwise
         accepted for another program they should, on a case-by-case, be considered for local
         treatment/demilitarization.
         3.12.7.3.2. If the safety of an asset (from a storage and handling aspect) cannot be
         determined with certainty, treat the asset as a Level 2 response and coordinate its
         treatment/disposal with the base environmental function, EOD, and the appropriate
         Air Force DDA. The installation commander has the final disposition authority.
  3.12.8. Disposition of COTS, Non-Stock-listed, Military Munitions.
     3.12.8.1. Disposition requests for munitions purchased through the COTS system (i.e.,
     certified by Non-nuclear Munitions safety Board (NNMSB) and approved by GACP for
     munitions system management) will be requested through the ADR process. If local
     stock numbers are assigned, list a DoD stock-listed item that the COTS munitions asset is
     closely related to (i.e., shotgun shells, 9mm hollow-point) in the remarks section.
     3.12.8.2. Commanders that elect to purchase COTS munitions not approved for
     munitions system management, but have received NNMSB approval, must accept
     ‘cradle-to-grave’ responsibility for the munitions at the local level. This includes all use
     outside the MSA and final disposition of malfunctions (Duds), residue, and excess.
  3.12.9. Disposition of Non-Stock-listed, Non-Military Munitions.
     3.12.9.1. When munitions found on base or turned in from amnesty boxes are delivered
     to the MSA, munitions personnel will ensure that EOD or Security Forces Squadron
     (SFS) have determined whether item(s) are derived from any military source. If this
     determination can be made with certainty, follow disposition instructions contained in
     paragraph 3.12.4.
     3.12.9.2. If it cannot be determined if the item(s) are from a military source, or safe from
     a storage and handling aspect, treat the item(s) as a Level 2 response and coordinate its
     disposal with the base environmental function and EOD.
         3.12.9.2.1. The installation Commander has the final disposition authority.
         3.12.9.2.2. If the decision is made to dispose, existing Air Force OB/OD Units
         should be considered. Prior to selecting an existing OB/OD Unit, the following
         conditions must exist:
            3.12.9.2.2.1. When explosive assets are declared Level-2, the munitions activity
            shall initiate actions through the local installation environmental function IAW
            paragraph 3.12.4.3.2.
            3.12.9.2.2.2. The OB/OD unit option is more cost effective than other local
            disposal options (i.e., civilian contract).
            3.12.9.2.2.3. The receiving installation OB/OD Unit must be EPA permitted to
            treat the type and quantity of munitions requiring disposal and to receive those
            waste munitions from off-site sources for disposal.
  3.12.10. Disposition procedures for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) unserviceable munitions
  generated at AF installations:
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    57


      3.12.10.1. The host installation FMS manager must request the installation munitions
      unit initiate disposition action for any FMS munitions in writing.
      3.12.10.2. The munitions unit will initiate an ADR as requested by the host installation
      FMS manager.
      3.12.10.3. Assets with an NSN in CAS will be processed as an ORG TIN. Assets with
      no NSN in CAS will be processed as Non-CAS ADR.
      3.12.10.4. The ADR will include:
          3.12.10.4.1. The reason for reporting.
          3.12.10.4.2. The name of owning FMS country.
          3.12.10.4.3. Request that disposition costs be provided.
          3.12.10.4.4. Request that ship-to disposal location be provided along with where to
          send Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR)/transfer funds for
          disposition.
      3.12.10.5. The AF DDA will coordinate with the DoD DDA and Army Disposal
      Installations for the requested information.
      3.12.10.6. The AF DDA will return the ADR to the requesting AF installation munitions
      unit providing instructions and requested information.
      3.12.10.7. All costs for shipment and disposition are the responsibility of the host
      installation FMS manager at the generating installation. The host installation FMS
      manager will arrange and transfer required funds IAW instructions provided on the ADR.
      Copies of the ADR and MIPR will accompany the shipment.
      3.12.10.8. The installation munitions unit will prepare and book shipment IAW DDA
      disposition instructions only after the MASO receives a copy of the funds transfer
      document provided by the installation FMS manager.
      3.12.10.9. The U.S. Army will provide closing disposal actions on the disposition
      request.
3.13. Management of Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard (MPPEH).
   3.13.1. MPPEH is material owned or controlled by the DoD (to include DoD contractors as
   provided in contracts) that, prior to determination of its explosives safety status, potentially
   contains explosives or munitions and typically includes munitions containers and packaging
   material; munitions debris remaining after munitions use, demilitarization, or disposal; and
   range-related debris. MPPEH also includes material that potentially contains a high enough
   concentration of explosives that the material presents an explosive hazard (e.g., equipment,
   drainage systems, holding tanks, piping, or ventilation ducts that were associated with
   munitions production, demilitarization, disposal operations).
   3.13.2. Excluded from MPPEH are:
      3.13.2.1. Munitions within the DoD-established munitions management system.
      Munitions maintained, stored, transported, and utilized within the operational stockpile
58                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


     are not considered MPPEH. This includes empty containers temporarily retained for
     repacking assets in maintenance or in-use for current operations.
     3.13.2.2. Munitions containers or packaging material that can be positively identified as
     explosive free through normal visual means are not considered MPPEH. These
     containers will still be inspected, certified, marked, sealed, segregated, and disposed of
     IAW DoDI 4140.62; DoD 4160.28-M, Vol. 1, 2, and 3; and T.O. 11A-1-60.
     3.13.2.3. Military munitions or material transferred within or released from DoD control
     that are used for their intended purposes. Transfer or release occurs when a receiver has
     acknowledged receipt of Material Documented as Safe (MDAS) (see paragraph
     3.13.3.2) or Material Documented as an Explosive Hazard (MDEH) (see paragraph
     3.13.3.3) by signed documentation (e.g., DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt
     Document, or an equivalent document) and has taken physical custody of the MDAS or
     MDEH from the Department of Defense.
     3.13.2.4. Material managed and handled by personnel outside of the DoD, except for
     defense contractors as provided in contracts.
  3.13.3. All generated MPPEH requires a documented inspection by qualified personnel to
  determine and classify MPPEH as either MDAS or MDEH IAW paragraph 3.13.9.2.
     3.13.3.1. Once MPPEH is determined to be either MDAS or MDEH, this material is no
     longer considered to be MPPEH.
     3.13.3.2. MDAS is previously generated MPPEH that has been inspected and
     documented (certified) as not presenting an explosive hazard. Once documented as
     MDAS, ensure this material is not misidentified as either MPPEH or MDEH.
     3.13.3.3. MDEH is previously generated MPPEH that cannot be documented as MDAS,
     and includes:
        3.13.3.3.1. MPPEH that has been inspected and documented as to the maximum
        explosive hazards the material is known or suspected to present. Once identified as
        MDEH, this material is no longer considered to be MPPEH. Ensure that MDEH is not
        misidentified as either MPPEH or MDAS. EXAMPLE: Potentially MDEH material
        is all explosive items and their containers that have been used, expended, or residue
        generated from disposal operations.
        3.13.3.3.2. MDEH classification only addresses the explosives safety status of
        material. EXAMPLE: MPPEH that cannot be positively determined to be MDAS,
        will be classified as MDEH and is therefore assumed to contain material with
        explosive hazards.
  3.13.4. MPPEH inspection and documentation as MDAS or MDEH is completed IAW
  paragraph 3.13.9.2.
 3.13.5. Establish and maintain a chain of custody for all MPPEH, MDAS, and MDEH
 through its life-cycle until transfer, expenditure, or disposal. Utilize existing CAS and
 munitions management procedures and processes in Chapter 7 to maintain a chain of
 custody for these assets. Existing physical, transactional, and informational processes all
 contribute to maintaining a chain of custody.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  59


  3.13.6. Segregation and Identification: Control, manage, and segregate MPPEH, MDAS,
  and MDEH to prevent its unauthorized use, transfer, or release. Comply with supply chain
  materiel management policies and explosive safety standards IAW existing CAS and
  munitions management procedures and processes in Chapter 7.
     3.13.6.1. Ensure that holding areas to control, manage, and segregate MPPEH, MDAS,
     and MDEH are located in secure areas and included in local facility threat assessments,
     when conducted by Resource Protection personnel.
         3.13.6.1.1. Generating activities collecting MPPEH, MDAS, and MDEH (e.g., scrap,
         waste, and residue) will identify assets and maintain proper segregation of these
         materiels and determine the point at which no further material will be added to ensure
         unauthorized / other types of items are not comingled. Generated MPPEH, MDAS,
         and MDEH explosive, incendiary, and chemical ammunition is dangerous and will
         never be commingled with other types of property.
         3.13.6.1.2. Units will contact DLA Disposition Services who will furnish additional
         guidance and, where possible, containers for use by scrap generators at the source.
     3.13.6.2. Under no circumstances will AF personnel release MPPEH to non-DoD entities
     for possession, management, and processing.
         3.13.6.2.1. Contracts or other legal agreements to transfer or release MPPEH to non-
         DoD entities are the responsibility of the generating activity. AF munitions activities
         and personnel do not generate MPPEH and therefore do not establish or fund
         contracts for release of MPPEH to non-DoD entities.
         3.13.6.2.2. Explosive hazards must be identified, known, and documented prior to
         the transfer of any MPPEH, MDEH, or MDAS within the Department of Defense;
         transfer of MDEH to a qualified receiver; or release of MDAS to the public.
         3.13.6.2.3. AF units, organizations, and activities that generate range-related debris
         are responsible for managing security, chain of custody, inspection, and
         documentation from collection through release from DoD control as MDAS. AF
         munitions personnel secure, manage, inspect, and document MPPEH, MDEH, or
         MDAS only when it is returned to the base or installation MSA for processing.
         3.13.6.2.4. IAW DoDI 4140.62, MPPEH will be managed and processed (e.g.,
         sorted, vented, inspected, segregated, secured) on the operational range or at the point
         of use to minimize handling and transport prior to processing and to facilitate
         disposition.
            3.13.6.2.4.1. The movement of MPPEH from either the operational range or the
            point of use could require its management as waste military munitions under
            applicable Federal or State requirements in certain circumstances.
            3.13.6.2.4.2. Commands and organizations will minimize transfer of explosive
            residue or munitions constituents from MPPEH into the environment during the
            management and disposition process.
            3.13.6.2.4.3. AF munitions personnel only transfer or release MPPEH and
            MDEH to those DoD components, activities, and personnel that meet the
            requirements for certification, licensing and permits, transportation, training, and
60                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


             experience outlined in DoDI 4140.62.
  3.13.7. Ensure that only MDAS is released to the public.
  3.13.8. Ensure that MPPEH awaiting documentation of its explosives safety status, MDEH,
  and MDAS are not commingled and are not mis-identified.
  3.13.9. Ensure that containers and holding areas for material being processed within the
  MSA are secured and clearly marked as to:
     3.13.9.1. The hazards, if any, that may be present.
     3.13.9.2. The inspection and reinspection (or processing and inspection) and
     documentation of the explosives safety status of the material present. Documentation of
     MDAS requires two independent signatures by trained and certified personnel.
         3.13.9.2.1. The first signatory must be technically qualified and may be either a DoD
         employee or a DoD contractor. This signatory must have performed or witnessed the
         initial 100-percent inspection or DDESB-approved processing of the material.
         3.13.9.2.2. The second signatory must be a technically qualified U.S. citizen who
         may be either a DoD employee or a DoD contractor. This signatory must have
         performed or witnessed the independent 100-percent reinspection or conducted an
         independent quality assurance inspection of processed material using an approved
         sampling method.
         3.13.9.2.3. Each signatory must ensure the chain of custody was maintained before
         signing the explosives safety documentation. If the chain of custody is found to have
         been broken while under DoD control, the explosives-safety-status documentation is
         no longer valid. The affected material will be considered MPPEH and shall undergo
         either a second 100-percent visual inspection process or reprocessing using a
         DDESB-approved methodology with appropriate post-processing inspection to re-
         establish the explosives safety status and chain of custody of this material.
         3.13.9.2.4. Air Force munitions personnel and qualified munitions inspector’s trained
         IAW the provisions of paragraph 3.8 are considered qualified to handle, inspect, and
         certify MPPEH, as appropriate. See DoDI 4140.62, for Qualification and Training
         guidelines.
  3.13.10. Ensure that locations used for MPPEH or MDEH processing operations (e.g.,
  consolidation, inspection, sorting, storage, transfer, release) have appropriate explosives
  safety siting.
  3.13.11. Munitions and MPPEH Demilitarization/Disposal Documentation Procedures.
     3.13.11.1. All ADR munitions assets authorized for demilitarization or disposal must be
     processed using program Create ADR Shipment (AMI28A). This program creates an A5J
     DD Form 1348-1A document for those ADRs that are being processed for DLA
     Disposition Services action and a SHP DD Form 1348-1A for disposal.
         3.13.11.1.1. When the demilitarization or disposal activity is not on the same base as
         the munitions account processing the A5J input, the DoDAAC of the base where the
         demilitarization or disposal activity is located must be entered as the “Ship to”
         address.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                61


            3.13.11.1.1.1. Inert, empty, or non-explosive munitions and components are
            demilitarized according to their DEMIL Code by qualified munitions personnel.
            When munitions flight personnel conduct the demilitarization, the base DLA
            Disposition Services DoDAAC will be the “Ship to” address.
            3.13.11.1.1.2. Transfers (Shipments) of MDAS which have not been
            demilitarized, or processed as scrap, to central disposal activities. Process these
            shipments using the ‘Shipment For Disposal’ selection within Create ADR
            Shipment (AMI28A) which creates a SHP DD Form 1348-1A document without
            demilitarization statements. Ship these assets according to paragraph 7.17.
            3.13.11.1.1.3. Demilitarized or scrap MDAS processed IAW an ADR and not
            shipped through local Deployment and Distribution Flight (Formerly TMO) (e.g.,
            turned over to base scrap vendors, recycling activity/points) will be processed
            using the ‘Shipment For DRMO’ selection within Create ADR Shipment
            (AMI28A) which creates an A5J DD Form 1348-1A document with appropriate
            demilitarization statements. The MASO will print name and sign in block 22 and
            date block 23 on the A5J when these assets are delivered to a base scrap vendor or
            recycling activity/point.    When shipped through local Deployment and
            Distribution Flight, transportation personnel will print, sign, and date these
            blocks.
        3.13.11.1.2. Explosives or classified assets must be fully demilitarized as directed by
        DoD 4160.21-M and DoD 4160.28-M, Vol. 1, 2, and 3. Non-explosives and non-
        classified assets must be demilitarized as directed by the demilitarization code
        assigned to them. Refer to the asset IDR or Web Federal Logistics Information
        System (WebFLIS) for demilitarization code, Controlled Inventory Item Code (CIIC),
        and definitions.
     3.13.11.2. Inspect, certify, and document Ammunition, Explosives, Dangerous Articles
     (AEDA), AEDA residue, MMPEH, range residue, and explosives-contaminated property,
     IAW DoD 4160.21-M, DoD 4160.28-M, Vol. 1, 2, and 3, DoDI 4140.62, and T.O. 11A-
     1-60.
        3.13.11.2.1. If a determination cannot be made if the residue is non-hazardous,
        consult with the DDA and the local Environmental Function (see paragraph
        3.13.11.2.4). Residue may have to be tested for Toxic Characteristic Leaching
        Process performed by an EPA certified laboratory. Report findings from the test to
        GACP for consolidation for future reference.
        3.13.11.2.2. Comply with documentation procedures of DoD 4160.21-M and DoDI
        4140.62.
            3.13.11.2.2.1. A legible copy of the explosives-safety-status documentation shall
            accompany documented material upon its transfer from DoD control. DoD
            Components generating MPPEH will maintain copies of explosives-safety-status
            documentation for 3 years after release from DoD control.
            3.13.11.2.2.2. Visual inspections may be used when safety can be assured. When
            visual inspection cannot provide assurance that MPPEH does not present an
            explosive hazard, other DDESB-approved means (e.g., thermal treatment) may
62                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


            have to be used to ensure that a release or transfer does not present an explosive
            hazard to a receiver. Only one signature is required to document MDEH when a
            visual inspection can positively assure MPPEH is documented as to the hazard it
            is known or suspected to present.
            3.13.11.2.2.3. Required documentation statements for the determination of
            material’s explosives safety status (e.g., MDAS, MDEH) are provided in DoDI
            4140.62. These statements document that either:
               3.13.11.2.2.3.1. MDAS: The material does not present an explosive hazard
               and is consequently safe from an explosives safety perspective for transfer
               within or release from DoD control.
               3.13.11.2.2.3.2. MDEH: The material is hazardous with the known or
               suspected explosive hazards (MDEH) stated and are only transferable or
               releasable to a qualified receiver.
            3.13.11.2.2.4. Demilitarization procedures established by DLA, the AF, or the
            Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) shall address when visual
            inspection is appropriate and the procedures that may be used to inspect or
            process MPPEH.
            3.13.11.2.2.5. Inspect and document MDAS or MDEH based on one of the
            following two conditions:
               3.13.11.2.2.5.1. After a 100-percent inspection and an independent 100-
               percent reinspection.
               3.13.11.2.2.5.2. After processing by a DDESB-approved means with an
               appropriate post-processing inspection.
        3.13.11.2.3. If additional instructions are required, contact the GACP through the
        CRM paragraph 1.6.2.
        3.13.11.2.4. The AF DDA will coordinate with PM for military munitions acquisition
        programs and the Director, DLA, to establish demilitarization requirements for
        MPPEH, MDEH, and MDAS. DoDI 4140.62 requires PMs for military munitions
        acquisition programs to ensure that the program’s planning, design, and
        implementation include MPPEH requirements to:
            3.13.11.2.4.1. Document the expected level of explosive residue and other
            munitions’ constituents that remain on used or demilitarized military munitions
            (e.g., cartridge casings).
            3.13.11.2.4.2. For MPPEH generated from munitions use, to define specific
            demilitarization and disposal procedures that comply with applicable DoD
            explosives safety standards, trade security controls, and demilitarization
            requirements.
     3.13.11.3. Temporary Property Accountability by:
        3.13.11.3.1. DLA Disposition Services: Munitions authorized for demilitarization or
        disposal according to the ADR will be scheduled for demilitarization or disposal on a
        certain date.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   63


              3.13.11.3.1.1. Coordination between munitions inspection, accountability, and
              the demilitarization activity will ensure that disposal documents are produced no
              earlier than 5 duty days before the scheduled demilitarization or disposal date.
              3.13.11.3.1.2. The A5J or SHP DD Form 1348-1A (as applicable) will be
              accomplished and original document provided to DLA Disposition Services with
              a copy to the Munitions Operations element.
              3.13.11.3.1.3. If complete disposal occurs (as with explosives) DLA Disposition
              Services will not normally receive scrap.
              3.13.11.3.1.4. Documents will then be routed to the Munitions Inspection
              Element for shipment inspection and temporary property accountability before the
              assets are transferred to the demilitarization activity or the DLA Disposition
              Services.
          3.13.11.3.2. EOD: Documents for the emergency disposal of munitions will be
          accomplished IAW paragraph 7.16.1.1.3.2.
      3.13.11.4. Demilitarization/Disposal Certification Procedures:
          3.13.11.4.1. DLA Disposition Services: If residual saleable materiel remains, the
          demilitarization official must certify that "DEMILITARIZATION HAS BEEN
          ACCOMPLISHED. THERE IS RESIDUAL MATERIEL WHICH HAS BEEN
          DOWNGRADED TO SCRAP". The stock number must be circled and the word
          SCRAP entered. The scrap materiel and the documents must be returned to DLA
          Disposition Services for processing.
          3.13.11.4.2. EOD: For complete destruction of items, emergency disposal action, the
          disposal and witnessing officials must certify "DISPOSAL HAS BEEN
          ACCOMPLISHED. THERE IS NO RESIDUAL MATERIEL WHICH HAS BEEN
          DOWNGRADED TO WASTE".               This statement will be annotated on the
          consumption issue document and signed by the disposal and witnessing officials.
3.14. Captured Enemy Ammunition (CEA).
   3.14.1. When CEA is found or located it must be reported to NAF (or other higher
   headquarters) as soon as possible. The NAF shall submit this information to the Joint
   Captured Materiel Exploitation Center (JCMEC) or Combined Captured Materiel
   Exploitation Center (CCMEC) (if a coalition operation is established) IAW paragraph
   8.4.8.4.
      3.14.1.1. Do not handle CEA when it is found. Until declared safe by EOD, treat all
      CEA in the same manner as unexploded ordnance (UXO).
      3.14.1.2. If possible, from a safe distance, identify and record pertinent facts such as the
      date, time, location (map reference), type (e.g., bomb, artillery shell, rocket), quantity,
      size, obvious markings, and other relevant information (e.g., SNs, nation of origin).
   3.14.2. Only competent command authorities will make determinations on whether CEA
   shall be disposed of in-place, identified or rendered safe for relocation, or retained for its
   inherent intelligence value. Munitions personnel are not authorized or qualified to make
64                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


  these decisions. Munitions personnel shall not take possession of, handle, or transport any
  CEA designated for emergency or routine disposal until rendered/declared safe by EOD.
  3.14.3. When competent authorities identify CEA to be retained for intelligence or other
  purpose, units may be directed or required to assist EOD personnel in render safe, handling,
  and relocation operations.
     3.14.3.1. Safety considerations are inherent in the responsibilities of any activity
     involved with handling CEA. Munitions personnel must exercise caution and follow
     good management practice in approaching, marking the location of, identifying,
     requesting EOD assistance, moving, storing, handling, and disposing of CEA.
     3.14.3.2. Improper handling, transportation, or use of CEA may jeopardize safety and
     result in loss of personnel, equipment, and mission capability and reduce intelligence
     value.
     3.14.3.3. Under all conditions and situations, consider CEA as extremely hazardous (e.g.,
     booby-trapped) until certified safe, in writing, by EOD personnel regardless of country of
     origin. Munitions supervisors will have written certification from EOD prior to handling
     by munitions personnel or acceptance for movement and storage.
  3.14.4. When competent authorities direct CEA to be retained and it is certified safe by EOD
  personnel, it becomes the property of the United States Government and the responsibility of
  the DoD.
     3.14.4.1. It is considered unusual for CEA to be turned-over to Air Force munitions
     personnel. Rather, technically qualified personnel from other military services, coalition
     forces, or government agencies will take charge of these assets. When these activities
     take possession of CEA, responsibility of AF munitions personnel or the MASO to
     manage and dispose of CEA is relinquished.
     3.14.4.2. Only when CEA is specifically directed by the JCMEC, CCMEC, or NAF to be
     retained by the AF, will AF munitions personnel become actively involved in managing
     CEA for storage, security, and retention.
     3.14.4.3. The JCMEC, CCMEC, or NAF may direct CEA be courtesy stored by AF
     munitions personnel for another military service or government agency. Only when CEA
     is specifically directed for AF retention and/or is courtesy stored by AF personnel shall
     CEA be accepted into the MSA for storage by munitions supervision or the MASO.
     3.14.4.4. CEA shall never be acquired, bought, sold, traded, disposed of, or used in any
     way that deviates from existing DoD or Air Force munitions management policy.
  3.14.5. CEA should only be accounted for and managed in CAS when there is an official
  NAF validated requirement. This requirement must be stated in a document, memo, or other
  written form, to maintain and issue CEA to AF or other government agency personnel in the
  performance of their official duties. Under all other conditions, CEA will not be managed in
  CAS or stored in the MSA unless a CSA is formulated and approved.
  3.14.6. When a valid AF CEA requirement exists, account for CEA in CAS as follows:
     3.14.6.1. Load a local pseudo CAS IDR record for CEA with all the available
     information provided from EOD.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                          65


     3.14.6.2. Process a FOB turn-in to establish accountability of CEA.
     3.14.6.3. Follow normal CAS processes for other CAS transactions.
     3.14.6.4. Account for and inventory CEA in the same manner as other Air Force
     munitions.
     3.14.6.5. Issue CEA IAW paragraph 3.14.7.
     3.14.6.6. Dispose of CEA IAW paragraph 3.14.9.
  3.14.7. Issuing CEA.
     3.14.7.1. The Combined or Joint Captured Materiel Exploitation Center
     (CCMEC/JCMEC) is the approving authority to issue or release serviceable CEA. The
     CCMEC/JCMEC establishes the priority of issue to AF or other government agencies.
     3.14.7.2. When a valid requirement exists and CEA is managed in CAS, issue CEA to
     organizations in the same manner as Air Force munitions.
  3.14.8. CEA Serviceability Procedure.
     3.14.8.1. Any CEA known to be unserviceable or containing physical defects or
     characteristics that cause serviceability to be suspect shall not be issued. Request
     disposition of these item IAW paragraph 3.14.9.
     3.14.8.2. Serviceable and safe to handle CEA is evacuated, collected, and stored
     wherever directed by JCMEC, MAJCOM, or NAF. Emergency, immediate, or routine
     destruction of CEA may also be directed.
     3.14.8.3. CEA is always segregated from Air Force stocks and accounted for in CAS in
     the same manner as Air Force munitions. Commanders shall provide a separate area for

AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                 67


      3.16.1.3. Accountability: LAU-131 rocket launchers used for flying operations will be
      loaded in CAS by lot number and will be accounted for on the DoDAAC. LAU-131
      rocket launchers used solely for Weapons Load Training (WLT), Weapons
      Standardization Section (WSS), or Armament systems training will be issued to the
      WLT, WSS, or Armament custody accounts.
      3.16.1.4. Storage: Storage of base stock assets is the responsibility of the local
      munitions activity. In-use assets will be stored by the Armament activity in flightline or
      backshop equipment storage areas.
   3.16.2. Countermeasure Chaff and Flare Magazines (ALE-40 series systems):
      3.16.2.1. The munitions activity performs general maintenance and minor repairs to
      countermeasure chaff and flare magazines during normal flightline processing. Flightline
      weapons personnel perform magazine maintenance for assets not in-use for daily flying
      (i.e., WRM magazines stored by AMXS).
      3.16.2.2. These chaff and flare magazines are aircraft equipment.           Therefore,
      replacement parts are requisitioned and provided by the AMXS support section. The
      AMXS support section establishes requirements for and maintains these parts on a bench
      or operating stock.
      3.16.2.3. Munitions activities may establish internal bench stocks for these
      countermeasures parts when the AMXS is identified as the Responsibility Center/Cost
      Center (RC/CC) on financial supply documents. Units shall not use MUNS, MXS, or
      EMS O&M funds to provide aircraft equipment parts.
3.17. Miniature Munitions Management.
   3.17.1. Miniature munitions carriage maintenance is the responsibility of 2W1X1 armament
   personnel. When loaded racks stored in the MSA require download of miniature weapons for
   maintenance, 2W0X1 personnel shall conduct required download and reload operations to
   facilitate maintenance.
   3.17.2. When miniature munitions are loaded on carriage systems, the assembly is stored in
   the MSA.
   3.17.3. The nature and extent of any maintenance or modification procedure will dictate the
   appropriate location where the maintenance is to be accomplished (e.g., Armament shop or
   MSA).
   3.17.4. Dependent upon mission, aircraft regeneration may use either the fully loaded
   carriage systems or single point delivery method to the flightline. Loaded carriage systems
   and individual miniature munitions may be delivered in or out of their respective containers.
   3.17.5. Miniature munitions will be managed by ammunition lot number according to the
   item T.O.. The CAS location field may be used to identify carriage and loaded Weapon
   Stock Number (WSN) or to identify a single miniature munition in a container.
   3.17.6. Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) Guided Bomb Unit (GBU)-39 (all variants):
      3.17.6.1. An AUR GBU-39 is one SDB in a CNU-659/E container, and will be managed
      by the appropriate AUR NSN.
 68                             AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


      3.17.6.2. The CR GBU-39 is four AUR GBU-39s loaded on a BRU-61 carriage in a
      CNU-660/E container. The CR NSN is only used for management at the assigned depot
      location and at the base level for WRM deep storage and shipping.
      3.17.6.3. During receipt of the CR GBU-39, load all BRU-61 carriages as Container
      Type “AME” (Alternate Mission Equipment) in CAS to allow Container-in-Container
      (CnC) management IAW paragraph 7.1.7. Then, use the ‘Add Weapons’ function in
      CAS to load each AUR onto the BRU-61.
          3.17.6.3.1. When the CR NSN is moved to ready use, out of WRM deep storage, the
          Munitions Inspector will perform a selective identity change in CAS to identify each
          of the four munitions as an individual AUR for expenditure processing.
          3.17.6.3.2. Upon receipt of the CR GBU-39, Munitions personnel will notify the
          Armament Section to load BRU-61 carriages into the appropriate maintenance and
          inspection data system. Armament Shop personnel will ensure BRU-61 carriages are
          picked up on base supply accountable records. BRU-61 is not accounted for in CAS.
      3.17.6.4. Ship individual munitions as an AUR GBU-39. Prior to shipping GBU-39s
      loaded on a BRU-61 perform a selective identity change in CAS to identify the loaded
      munitions as a CR GBU-39. Upon shipment of the CR GBU-39, munitions personnel
      will notify the Armament section to remove BRU-61 carriages from the appropriate
      maintenance, inspection, and supply systems.
      3.17.6.5. At the base-level, process all GBU-39 expenditures against the AUR NSN.
3.18. Conventional Munitions as Critical Loads.
   3.18.1. For the purpose of maintaining materials handling and storage equipment, including
   lifting and hoisting devices, as outlined in AFI 91-203, the handling, lifting, and hoisting of a
   conventional munitions item is considered to be a ‘non-critical’ load.
   3.18.2. This determination does not preclude any functional manager (e.g., unit, base, NAF,
   MAJCOM) over a facility where the lifting of conventional munitions will occur from
   designating a particular lift or lifting operation as a critical load, when:
      3.18.2.1. Environmental or operational conditions are such that normal safety practices,
      existing safety rules and policies, technical procedures, or operational risk management
      (ORM) concepts are inadequate or cannot be satisfied during lifting of conventional
      munitions.
      3.18.2.2. Damage may occur because the non-critical item must be lifted above a critical
      item (e.g., conventional loads in close proximity to a nuclear component or near
      concentrations of unrelated hazardous materials).
   3.18.3. Anytime a functional manager designates a lifting or hoisting operation as a critical
   load, the specific equipment maintenance, inspection, testing, and documentation
   requirements of AFI 91-203 shall be met.
3.19. Air Force Munitions Command and Control (AFMC2).
   3.19.1. MAJCOM munitions functional and action officers gain visitor (read) access to the
   AFMC2 site by submitting a memorandum to the ACC/A4W AFMC2 SharePoint

   accept, possess, or provide storage for untagged PE assets, unless specifically
   excepted/exempted by the Act or written provision. If the tagging status or condition of a PE
   asset is unknown and/or cannot be verified, the item shall be considered untagged.
   3.24.2. Authority to ‘refuse’ to accept untagged PE for storage applies to routine,
   emergency, temporary, or long term conditions; and to requests from any activity, and for
   any reason. This includes other military services and organizations (e.g., EOD, Security
   Forces (SF), OSI, Special Operations Forces (SOF)); and federal, state, or local law
   enforcement agencies (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); Bureau of Alcohol,
   Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF); and local police departments).
   3.24.3. Before storing any untagged PE, the Commander shall obtain advice from the local
   JA. Air Force personnel are not exempt from the provisions of this Act. Failure to follow
   provisions of this Act may impose severe legal or pecuniary consequences for possession of
   these items, even in the performance of military duties.
   3.24.4. Any proposed exception from the Act must be fully approved, in writing, and
   provided to the local JA for legal review and advice to the Commander of the storing activity
   before the munitions storage activity may accept untagged PE items for storage..
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                              73


  3.24.5. The requesting organization or agency, not the Air Force or the munitions storage
  activity, is responsible to prepare and petition the ATF for any exception/exemption from
  provisions of the Act. Only after such exceptions are granted, and a JA review is complete,
  may the munitions storage activity store untagged PE assets. The JA or Air Force units may
  disapprove requests to store exempted/excepted untagged PE if such storage imposes undue
  legal, safety, security, operational, or environmental constraints.23.1.         Munitions
  organizations must have the Ability To Survive and Operate (ATSO) in a Chemical,
  Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and high-yield Explosives (CBRNE) Environment and be
  capable of executing contamination avoidance procedures and/or performing munitions
  operations in a contaminated environment.

                                          Chapter 7

             MANAGING CONVENTIONAL MUNITIONS OPERATIONS

7.1. Munitions Operating Procedures.
   7.1.1. Introduction. This chapter provides munitions management procedures at the tactical-
   level (base). It describes the requirements and processes to manage munitions accountability
   and complete CAS transaction depicted in Figure 7.1, Munitions Operational Flow Process
   (Peacetime and Wartime). These processes focus on near-real time CAS transaction
   processing using automated-, direct-, or remote-input methods on the flightline and in the
   munitions area during peacetime and wartime. Near-real time asset visibility is an Air Force
   requirement at all AF echelons. To achieve this, maximize utilization of available
   technologies to process munitions transactions in CAS immediately, but not later than 1-hour
   of event to the maximum extent possible.
      7.1.1.1. Automated-Input Methods: Automated-input is a ‘point-of-use’ processing
      method that includes AIT capabilities, Hand-Held Terminal (HHT) readers, Radio
      Frequency Identification (RFID), and other machine devices enabled by secure Common
      Access Card (CAC) authentication and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) capabilities.
      Automated capabilities are functional at any location the Internet is accessible by signing
      onto the web-enabled CAS system. Munitions and weapons personnel use automated
      hardware and software applications to transmit transaction data into CAS automatically.
      This data may be saved in the hardware memory to be uploaded into CAS later or
      transmitted immediately through hard-wired or AF approved wireless technology to a
      base LAN or Wide Area Network (WAN).
      7.1.1.2. Direct-Input Methods: Direct-input is a ‘point-of-use’ processing method that
      includes processing transactions directly in CAS through key punch using docked,
      undocked, or wireless enabled computers or laptops at any location. Munitions and
      weapons personnel performing munitions operations and tasks input CAS transaction
      data directly into CAS from or near work locations (Refer to paragraph 7.1.4.3.1.2).
      7.1.1.3. Remote-Input Methods: Remote-input is not considered a ‘point-of-use’
      transaction and involves passing munitions information and data (e.g., movement,
      expenditures) to Control Centers or processing locations where CAS transaction are
      processed. Remote-input uses secure and unsecure Land Mobile Radios (LMR),
      telecommunications, or the use of runners. Ensure Operations Security (OPSEC) is
      maintained at all times when using remote-input.
   7.1.2. General Guidance:
      7.1.2.1. Managing Munitions from the DoDAAC stock:
          7.1.2.1.1. Do not use custody accounts to manage flightline, aircraft support, or
          internal munition area munitions assets. Manage these munitions, to include NWRM,
          from the DoDAAC. This includes operations of assigned tenant flying units (e.g.,
          Total Force Integration, Air Reserve Component). To the fullest extent possible,
          expend these assets by CR (if applicable) against the appropriate Organizational Shop
 94                            AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


           Code (OSC) using near-real time CAS transaction processing (e.g., automated-,
           direct-, or remote-input methods).
EXCEPTION: Lead MAJCOMs may approve unit-level custody account management
procedures for flightline and aircraft support of unique missions which include STAMP, theater
hubs, Aging and Surveillance (A&S); and RDT&E programs. These procedures will include
near-real time CAS transaction processing.
           7.1.2.1.2. Assigned tenant units of other MAJCOMs may have a separate DoDAAC.
           In this case, allocation and accountability management is the responsibility of the
           tenant unit. If tenant flying units do not have a separate DoDAAC, tenant unit
           munitions allocations are applied to the tenant unit ORG/SHP in CAS, and
           accountability management of the munitions assets applies to the unit managing the
           DoDAAC.
           7.1.2.1.3. SOCOM and AFCENT units supporting non-traditional operations may
           manage assets on custody accounts, with AFSOC/A4MS approval.
       7.1.2.2. To minimize the volume and frequency of CAS transactions associated with
       movements and location updates, units may manage ready-use/operationally configured
       gun ammunition and countermeasures following CnC procedures of paragraph 7.1.7 or
       use locally developed procedures provided they are included in a Movement Control OI.
       Regardless of the method used, general safety and accountability concepts will be
       maintained.
       7.1.2.3. Assets with a Part Number (P/N) greater than 8 characters will be loaded with a
       Local “L” identifier in CAS as a local stock number. In this case, a P/N “P” identifier
       will not be used in the National Item Identification Number (NIIN) field. CAS will
       truncate any digits beyond the “P” plus the 8 character P/N causing the asset to lose its
       P/N identity. This constitutes a valid requirement to assign an “L” control in CAS. Units
       are not required to submit an AF Form 86.
   7.1.3. NWRM Management: Effective management, Positive Inventory Control (PIC) and
   Total Asset Visibility (TAV) is required for all NWRM. This instruction focuses on
   management of NWRM items within CAS. Primary policies for NWRM management are
   included within AFI 20-110, AFMAN 23-110, and AFI 24-203 and must be used in
   conjunction with this instruction for proper NWRM management.
   7.1.4. The Munitions Operational Flow Process: All munitions activities and units use a
   single munitions operational flow process in peacetime and in wartime, at home-station and
   at deployed locations, to effectively support aircraft sortie generation and other operational
   missions. All munitions transactions are processed within the web-enabled Combat
   Ammunition System (CAS). Munitions supervisors and managers must integrate these
   processes into their section, element, and crew procedures, operating instructions, and
   training plans to ensure personnel are knowledgeable of these processes. Major process
   phases include: Planning, Execution, and Transaction Entry as depicted in Figure 7.1. Each
   phase has steps that occur continuously, overlap, and are not bound by geography or mission.
   The sequence or assignment of responsibilities may differ locally. However, each step is
   essential to assure high levels of accountability, accuracy of near-real time CAS transaction
   processing, asset visibility, and enable effective decision-making.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                               95


     7.1.4.1. Planning Phase. Refer to Figure 7.1.
        7.1.4.1.1. Receive Demand/Requests: Munitions requests for external support are
        received from supported organizations and agencies. Munitions requests for internal
        munitions activity are derived through the munitions scheduling process, such as
        receipt, shipping, maintenance, inspection, or warehousing tasks.
            7.1.4.1.1.1. Requests to support sortie generation are normally received in the
            form of an Air Tasking Order (ATO), flying schedule, or through AF 2407,
            Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination. When received, the controlling
            activity, generally munitions control, must evaluate and convert requests and
            prioritize individual builds to support aircraft sorties.
            7.1.4.1.1.2. Requests to support custody accounts are received by munitions
            operations or munitions control from the account custodian through electronic or
            other communications. These requests are processed in CAS by munitions
            operations or munitions control personnel, added to the munitions schedule as
            scheduled or unscheduled tasks, and accomplished to meet the customer demand.
            Processes should focus on meeting customer demands and requests quickly and
            efficiently. Customer support should not be delayed by internal scheduling
            processes or management controls.
            7.1.4.1.1.3. Requirements to support internal munitions activity are typically
            forecasted and scheduled in quarterly rolling forecasts, monthly plans, and weekly
            production schedules or may be unscheduled. Integrate these requirements with
            external support schedules to effectively meet all workloads.
        7.1.4.1.2. Validate Allocation: During peacetime operations, remaining allocations
        must be validated by the controlling function before assets are delivered using the
        Asset Level Inquiry (AMQ07A) to ensure munitions are not expended without an
        approved allocation. All munitions functions that handle, process, deliver and
        support flightline munitions have responsibilities to ensure that approved allocations
        are not exceeded. In wartime, requests are generally only constrained by availability
        and safety factors.
        7.1.4.1.3. Determine Asset Availability: After validating allocations, determine
        availability of assets. Review CAS for pre-built assets that satisfy the request using
        Complete Round Inquiry (AM522A), Complete Round Asset Summary (AM523A),
        etc. Determine component availability to satisfy any remaining quantity using
        Complete Round Analyzer (AMR01A), Complete Round Build-up (AMJ01A), etc.
        7.1.4.1.4. Component/Lot Selection: Select and utilize available pre-built assets. If
        additional assets are needed select components by lot, or requisition assets, if
        authorized.
     7.1.4.2. Execution Phase. Refer to Figure 7.1.
        7.1.4.2.1. Movement to Build Location: Break-out selected assets, deliver to build-
        up/processing site, and update location using CAS Movement Process (AM104A).
            7.1.4.2.1.1. Once moved to the build-up/processing site, manage locations IAW
            Movement Control OI.
96                       AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


        7.1.4.2.1.2. Notify Munitions Control of any fire and hazard symbols and CIIC
        changes.
     7.1.4.2.2. Inspect Assets and Process Condition Codes Changes:            Perform
     appropriate inspections IAW T.O. 11A-1-10 and T.O. 11A-1-63 and any required
     preparatory or maintenance actions. Process any required CC changes in CAS.
     7.1.4.2.3. Identify CR Batch Quantity, Process WSN Build, Build/Assemble: After
     inspections, preparatory actions, and CC updates are completed, begin the CAS CR
     build-up process.
        7.1.4.2.3.1. Properly identify all components used to build CRs. A WSN is a 14-
        digit code identifying the CRWC, DoDAAC, and batch number. CAS assigns a
        WSN for each build utilizing the same lot number of like components per similar
        CRWC.
        7.1.4.2.3.2. Assembling a CR in CAS may be done either before, during, or after
        assembly of physical assets. However, to prevent mixing WSNs of CRs, it is
        recommended that the CR assembly be processed in CAS prior to beginning the
        physical build-up/assembly. It is essential that a new, unique WSN is generated
        any time a batch (lot) is depleted during a CR build.
            7.1.4.2.3.2.1. When a CAS generated WSN is assigned, each CR will be
            properly marked with an abbreviated WSN consisting of the CRWC and the
            last three digits of the WSN (i.e., BL2CM-XXX). Unless prohibited by the
            item T.O. the CR will be conspicuously marked. Marking of WSN on
            chaff/flare magazine, 2.75" rockets, BDU-33 practice bombs, and 105MM
            rounds is not required.
            7.1.4.2.3.2.2. If CAS or AIT is not immediately available, document all CR
            build-up, assembly, or processing actions on an AF IMT 4331, MTS and
            utilize automated-, direct-, or remote-input to process CR actions in CAS
            within one-hour. Assign and annotate a ‘T’ (Temporary) designator on each
            CR between the CRWC and batch number signifying it a Temporary WSN
            (BL2CM-TXXX). When CAS becomes available either remark the CR with
            the CAS assigned permanent WSN, or retain the temporary WSN on each CR
            provided that a WSN cross-reference list is maintained.
            7.1.4.2.3.2.3. Additional local CR suffix markings may be used with the
            abbreviated WSN to identify munitions configurations. EXAMPLE: A CR
            wired for triple-ejection racks (TER) or parent-mount racks and/or (X or +)
            fin configuration; a CR marked with (BC21H-35T+) might identify a conical
            MK-82 wired for a TER ‘T’ with the fin in the + configuration.
     7.1.4.2.4. Move to Holding Area or Load Aircraft: After CR munitions are
     assembled (if applicable), all assets (e.g., CR, AUR, components) are typically moved
     to holding areas awaiting custodian pick-up, to trailers and then holding areas for
     future delivery, to storage locations, or directly to aircraft parking locations for
     aircraft loading. All of these locations are loaded in CAS as facilities or containers
     allowing the use of CAS Movement Process (AM104A) to process these movement
     transactions in CAS.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                97


            7.1.4.2.4.1. CR Movements: For CRs, use abbreviated WSN showing the CRWC
            and the last three digits of the WSN in the CAS location. EXAMPLE: BL2CM-
            XXX. EXCEPTION: This is not required for CnC moves as CAS provides the
            default locations.
            7.1.4.2.4.2. Validating Munitions Movements. Munitions managers, sections,
            and work centers must use the Storage Location Report (AM567A) to assist in
            reconciling assets in operating locations. Operating locations should be
            inventoried daily to ensure movement processing and location accuracy.
        7.1.4.2.5. Pre-transaction Validation of Assets Receipt, Shipped, or Expended:
        Before processing any CAS transaction, task data supporting a transaction must be
        validated at the ‘point-of-use’ to ensure 100-percent accuracy. This validation is an
        ‘Execution’ phase step making it a key step in the sortie generation or customer
        support process. EXAMPLE: An individual processing a CAS transaction must
        query CAS to determine the correct assets loaded on an aircraft prior to processing
        the expenditure. A similar query must be completed for every task performed and is
        essential to ensure accuracy of CAS transactions.
            7.1.4.2.5.1. Validate all information and data on receipt/shipping documents
            matches physical assets exactly before processing receipt and shipment
            transactions. Then, process these transactions in CAS IAW paragraphs 7.15 and
            7.17, as they occur throughout the day, using automated-, direct-, remote-input
            methods.
            7.1.4.2.5.2. Validate flightline task activity before processing movement or
            expenditure in CAS. Documentation of weapons/munitions activity on an AF
            IMT 2434 by the Weapons Expediter indicates that this validation has been
            completed.
        7.1.4.2.6. Download, Recover, or Refrag Assets: If assets are not shipped or
        expended, then they must be either downloaded from aircraft, recovered back to the
        munitions area, or refrag assets to another mission. This generally involves a location
        movement using CAS Movement Process (AM104A).
     7.1.4.3. Transaction Entry Phase: Refer to Figure 7.1.
        7.1.4.3.1. Process Transactions in CAS: This phase culminates all previous actions
        and steps within the Munitions Operations Flow Process and results in a properly
        processed CAS transaction. Processing transactions in CAS changes the asset
        posture, stockpile balance, or asset condition. These changes are visible to stockpile
        managers at all levels and may impact logistics support decisions. While timely CAS
        processing is desired, this should not overshadow the importance of accurate CAS
        processing. Process CAS transaction using automated-, direct-, or remote-input
        methods as outlined below:
            7.1.4.3.1.1. Automated-Input: Process CAS transactions automatically using AIT
            as the preferred method. Units and installations where AIT capabilities have been
            bed-down will maximize the use of AIT and automated-input methods. Process
            automated-input transactions IAW this instruction, paragraph 7.1.5, and
            published AIT equipment manuals or procedural guidance. Munitions and
98                       AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


        Weapons managers must maintain awareness of their AIT capabilities to include
        personnel training to consider if and when to utilize direct- or remote-input
        methods to best meet the mission.
        7.1.4.3.1.2. Direct-Input: Process CAS transactions using direct-input when
        automated-input methods are not available or cannot be employed effectively to
        streamline operational processes.
            7.1.4.3.1.2.1. When using direct-input methods do not inhibit processes with
            excessive management controls. Rather, emphasize data validation at the
            ‘point-of-use’ at all steps in the process prior to processing CAS transactions
            to provide the level of accuracy required for direct-input processing.
            7.1.4.3.1.2.2. CAS transactions may be processed by a worker, supervisor, or
            crew chief performing the munitions/weapons task, munitions control, storage
            dispatch, assembly pad supervisor, weapons expediter, processing bay chief,
            munitions inspector, or any other individual designated by munitions/
            weapons supervision to perform these activities.
        7.1.4.3.1.3. Remote-Input: Only process CAS transactions using remote-input
        when automated-input and direct-input methods are not available, not possible, or
        cannot be employed effectively to streamline operational processes.
     7.1.4.3.2. When ‘point-of-use’ transaction data cannot be processed in CAS
     immediately or must be physically delivered to another location for CAS processing,
     document the munitions or weapons loading activity. Munitions activity is
     documented on the AF IMT 4331, MTS and weapons loading and expenditure
     activity is documented on the AF IMT 2434, IAW AFI 21-101. As soon as CAS
     access becomes available, process the previously documented activity in CAS.
     Retain this documentation until the 100-percent movement validation is completed
     IAW paragraph 5.2.6.
        7.1.4.3.2.1. Munitions/weapons managers or MASO direct documentation when
        required by policy or when, in their judgment, it is required to maintain an
        auditable document trail or to validate data accuracy of CAS transaction
        processing. Munitions/weapons managers must decide what level and amount of
        data record is necessary to validate munitions activity and CAS transactions.
        Avoid excessive management controls and documentation that delays or hinders
        mission execution.
            7.1.4.3.2.1.1. The AF IMT 4331, MTS: The MTS is a multi-purpose form
            designed to record all types of munitions transaction/data for general,
            accountable, and auditable munitions activity during peacetime and wartime.
            The MTS is also a management tool that facilitates the validation of CAS
            transaction processing.
              7.1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Documenting the MTS: The first six blocks of the MTS are
              administrative in nature and determine what process the form will be used to
              record. The remaining blocks are used to capture individual transaction data
              related to that process. Each line is capable of recording all the necessary
              information to process a single transaction in CAS and is self-explanatory.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                 99


                  7.1.4.3.2.1.1.2. Recording of custody account movements on the MTS only
                  applies to movement of custody assets stored within the MSA, initial
                  transfer to the custodian, and physical receipts of assets from the custodian.
                  7.1.4.3.2.1.1.3. MAJCOMS may authorize local modification to the MTS as
                  long as the original data elements are included.
                  7.1.4.3.2.1.1.4. DELETED.
                7.1.4.3.2.1.2. The AF IMT 2434, Munitions Configuration and Expenditure
                Document: The AF IMT 2434 is used to record weapons/munitions loaded
                and expended from aircraft. Document weapons/munitions activity and route
                the AF IMT 2434 IAW AFI 21-101.
         7.1.4.3.3. Validate CAS Data Entry of Flightline Munitions Activity: This validation
         provides the MASO and munitions manager’s with confidence that CAS transaction
         history for Flightline activity is accurate. The Transaction History Report (AM903A)
         must be compared against the AF IMT 2434 or other documents and discrepancies
         researched and corrected.
         7.1.4.3.4. Document Control and Management: Routing, control, and management
         of documents represent the final steps in the Munitions Operational Flow Process.
         Elimination and reduction of paper documents within this process remains an
         important goal. However, certain accountable, auditable, or other documents key to
         management review and validation must be routed to appropriate activities.
         Munitions Document Control Procedures for document routing, flow, control, and
         filing are provided in Attachment 6.
  7.1.5. Internet Access and AIT:
     7.1.5.1. Internet Access: CAS is a web-based system dependent on continuous Internet
     connectivity. This connectivity is not optional. Timely and accurate munitions up-
     channel reporting and subsequent resupply efforts depend on this connectivity. Where
     approved and when available, use of commercial wireless technology to speed data input
     is encouraged.
     7.1.5.2. Personnel that have a valid CAC card, an Air Force Portal account, and are
     authorized to process CAS transactions can do so at any location where Internet access is
     available by signing on the web-enabled CAS system. Weapons expediters and other
     personnel performing munitions tasks and operations input CAS transaction data directly
     into CAS from or near work locations.
     7.1.5.3. AIT: After validation that tasks are completed, technicians, weapons expediters,
     and supervisors use automated hardware and software applications to transmit transaction
     data into CAS automatically. This data may be saved in the hardware memory to be
     uploaded into CAS later or transmitted immediately through hard-wired or AF approved
     wireless technology to a base LAN or WAN. In addition to technical-procedural
     guidance for the use of AIT equipment on the AFMC2 site, the following guidance will
     be used:
         7.1.5.3.1. Munitions movements and expenditures will be processed in CAS using
         automated means (e.g., Hand Held Terminal (HHT) scanners or other automated
100                        AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


      methods) by Munitions/Weapons personnel as actions occur throughout the day. If
      automated capability is not available or functional, maximize the use of direct-input.
      If direct-input capability is not available or functional, then utilize remote-input.
      7.1.5.3.2. If automated capability is available and functional, but wireless
      connectivity is lost or unavailable, HHT scanners will ‘Batch Mode’ transactions onto
      the scanning device until connectivity is restored/obtained (wireless connectivity or
      HHT docking).
      7.1.5.3.3. When operating in Batch Mode all ‘unprocessed’ Batch Mode transactions
      must be synchronized (processed by gaining wireless connectivity or HHT docking)
      to ensure processing in the correct chronological sequence, as they occurred.
      7.1.5.3.4. CAS has the capability to print two-dimensional AIT barcode labels for
      warehouses, containers, WSNs, assets, and consolidated assets (multiple NSNs).
      However, currently fielded printers may not be compatible or have the capability to
      accurately print specific AIT labels. Units should contact their MAJCOM if they
      desire to utilize this CAS capability before standardized AF equipment and materials
      are provided to them.
      7.1.5.3.5. Standardized label equipment and labels have been identified and
      MAJCOMs are working to field this AIT equipment. Unless directed by the
      MAJCOM, units will not purchase their own AIT equipment.
      7.1.5.3.6. AIT Labels: To automate the data entry process, two dimensional barcode
      labels are used with human readable data. Barcode data identifiers tell the handheld
      terminal (HHT) scanner what type of data is being read and where it should be placed
      on the HHT screen. CAS provides the user the capability to print the following labels
      using a desktop printer or a hip printer attached to the HHT.
         7.1.5.3.6.1. Warehouse Label: The warehouse label contains the structure and
         location, and when scanned displays the contents of that location. These labels
         will be placed on corner markers to identify a specific structure location. If
         corner markers cannot be utilized, affix labels to walls, clipboards, signs, or other
         means to clearly display labels to meet operational needs.
         7.1.5.3.6.2. Container Label: The container label contains the container ID and
         IUID, and when scanned displays the container and any assets within the
         container. The container label should be placed near the field number or location
         that best facilitates visibility and ease of use.
         7.1.5.3.6.3. WSN Label: The WSN label contains a WSN, and when scanned
         will select that specific WSN. The WSN label should be placed on the munitions
         item in a location that best facilitates visibility when installed on an aircraft (e.g.,
         fin or airfoil group for bombs and near the missile SN).
         7.1.5.3.6.4. Asset Label: The asset label contains the mandatory data elements
         for marking munitions packing IAW MIL-STD 129. All available asset
         information is pre-populated based on the indicative data record and user input.
         All data elements are editable and users must ensure that data is accurate. The
         asset label can be generated for all levels of packaging. The label contains a
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    101


             unique traceability code to prevent duplicate scanning. The user must ensure
             labels are replaced on both the front and side of containers. Dual labels on front
             and side constitutes the minimum required markings and minimizes the need to
             add/stencil other marking.
             EXCEPTION: United Nations (UN) and Performance Oriented Packaging (POP)
             markings are not included in the asset label and must be added.
             7.1.5.3.6.5. Consolidated Asset Label. The consolidated asset label provides the
             same capability as the Asset Label except it allows multiple NSNs to be added to
             the label.
         7.1.5.3.7. AIT Conflict Resolution (AMP09A).       In an off-line environment,
         transactions must be processed using AIT in the chronological sequence that they
         actually occur.
             7.1.5.3.7.1. To support the automated data capture process in an off-line
             environment it is possible that a transaction created by one user may not process
             in CAS because the transaction is dependent upon the processing of another user’s
             transaction. EXAMPLE: In an off-line mode, Crew 1 moves a loaded trailer
             from an operating location (OL1) to a holding pad (HP1) and then crew 2 moves
             the trailer from (HP1) to a flightline location (S1). If crew 2 processes the trailer
             movement from HP1 to S1, CAS would create an error, since CAS would still
             show the trailer in OL1. Crew 1 must process the first transaction (OL1 to HP1)
             before crew 2 can process the second transaction.
             7.1.5.3.7.2. Units using AIT must monitor the AIT Conflict Resolution program
             on a daily basis to ensure transactions are being cleared and updated to clear
             outstanding transactions.
         7.1.5.3.8. Units are authorized to develop local capabilities and associated procedures
         (e.g., wireless laptops, notebooks, cellular devices/air-cards, etc.) to meet the intent of
         using AIT to process transactions at the ‘Point-of-Use’ and in the most expedient and
         efficient means possible.
         7.1.5.3.9. Units must develop processes to ensure off-line (Batch Mode) transactions
         are processed at sufficient intervals necessary to support the mission.
             7.1.5.3.9.1. If automated capability is available and functional, but wireless
             connectivity is lost or unavailable, HHT scanners will ‘Batch Mode’ transactions
             onto the scanning device until connectivity is restored/obtained (wireless
             connectivity or HHT docking).
             7.1.5.3.9.2. When operating in Batch Mode all ‘unprocessed’ Batch Mode
             transactions must be synchronized (processed by gaining wireless connectivity or
             HHT docking) prior to aircraft recovery.
             NOTE: Synchronizing ensures that transactions are processed in the correct
             chronological sequence, as they occurred.
  7.1.6. Structure Management. All munitions facilities, revetments/pads, Hardened Aircraft
  Structures (HAS)/Protective Aircraft Structures (PAS), aircraft parking spots, and holding
  areas for munitions, will be loaded as individual CAS structures. This process allows assets
 102                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


   to be moved between structures using the normal CAS Movement Process (AM104A) and
   enables the use of CAS management products to track assembled assets in their physical
   location using the Storage Location Report (AM567A). In addition, a structure titled ‘Off-
   Station’ may be created for assets currently ‘off station’ and planned to be receipted at a
   Forward Operating Location (FOL) or due to return to the base.
   7.1.7. Container-in-Container (CnC) Management: CnC capability provides a parent-child
   relationship that enables the movement of a container and its contents in a single move,
   where the NEW, compatibility and CIIC of the contents are applied to the container’s
   location within a structure.
       7.1.7.1. Containers are classified by ‘type’ and ‘sub-type’ to improve overall
       management of containers. Templates and naming conventions for container types and
       sub-types are pre-defined in CAS to standardize these across the Air Force. If container
       types or sub-types do not support requirements, contact your MAJCOM. EXAMPLE:
Container Type and Container Sub-Type
Aircraft: B-1B, F-15C, F-16B30, etc.
Trailer: MHU-110, MHU-196, 40ft, etc.
ISO: USUF; 20ft side opener; 20ft end opener, etc.
AME: SUU-25, BRU-61, Mags, Chaff/Flare.
       7.1.7.2. AME container ID formats are provided by HQ ACC/A4WA and loaded on the
       AFMC2 site. If container types, sub-types, or container IDs do not support requirements,
       contact your MAJCOM who will work through ACC/A4WC to add or change container
       types/sub-types and identify new container ID codes.
       7.1.7.3. For containers currently loaded as structures containing assets; create new
       container IDs IAW the following procedures and move assets to the newly created
       container before deleting the structure in CAS.
       7.1.7.4. Once loaded, a container ID carries a maintenance detail record. While not
       mandatory to update, they enable additional capabilities. The maintenance detail record
       varies based on container type. Aircraft detail records have information on the owning
       organization and allow the ORG/SHP code and munitions CAT Codes to be specified for
       all expenditures processed against the given container ID. An ISO detail record is used to
       update container information necessary to ship a loaded or empty container. All detail
       records provides the capability to check the contents being moved into it against a
       specified Complete Round Weapons Code (CRWC) or codes.
       7.1.7.5. Container IDs may be added or deleted from the system as needed by the using
       organization. Items in the context of CnC are not accountable in CAS.
          7.1.7.5.1. An accountable container may be assigned a container ID for ease of
          tracking, however it is the stock level of this NSN that is accountable, not the CnC
          container ID.
          7.1.7.5.2. Once the container ID is assigned, the accountable NSN would be moved
          into the container ID, pairing the two together to make it easier to track and utilize.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    103


       7.1.7.6. Individual Container Identification. A unique 10-digit identifier must be
       assigned to each container managed in CAS and cannot be duplicated, regardless of type
       or sub-type. Each unit will load individual containers by appropriate container type and
       sub-type using Container Maintenance (AM106A). Container ID Naming Conventions
       will be standardized across the AF enterprise as follows:
NOTE: If a ‘duplication’ error is received in CAS contact the CAS Help Desk or submit a CAS
DR.
           7.1.7.6.1. Aircraft. Load the two-digit aircraft wing designator ‘tail flash’ as position
           1 and 2 (i.e., Langley = FF), the two-digit year as position 3 and 4 (i.e., 1989 = 89),
           and a 6-digit aircraft tail number as position 5 thru 10 (i.e., FF89123456). Units are
           not required to update Aircraft container locations in CAS.
NOTE: Units without assigned aircraft will use a two-digit Command Code of parent MAJCOM
as the tail flash designator. As follows:
0B – USAFA                                                   0D – USAFE
                      0J – AETC
0R – PACAF                                                   0M – AFRC
                      XX – AFSOC
1C – ACC                                                             1F – GACP
                                      1L – AMC
1M – AFMC                                                    1S – AFSPC
                      3X – AFCNT
4Z – ANG                                                             GS – AFGSC
           7.1.7.6.2. Trailers. Load the two-position wing designator as position 1 and 2, the
           three-digit trailer type as position 3 thru 5, and the five-digit assigned SN as position
           6 thru 10 (e.g., FF11012345 = MHU-110 or FF25F12345 = 25FT). Units will update
           Trailer container locations in CAS.
           7.1.7.6.3. Transportation Modules (Mods). Load the two-position wing designator as
           position 1 and 2, the three-digit module type as position 3 thru 5, and the five-digit
           assigned SN as position 6 thru 10 (e.g., FFB3312345 = BDU-33, FFRKT12345 =
           rockets, or FFC-F12345 = Chaff-Flare).
           NOTE: Units that have loaded containers under Chaff and/or Flare type must move
           the containers to the ‘Chaff-Flare’ type. Units will update Module container locations
           in CAS.
           7.1.7.6.4. Ammunition Loaders. Load the two-position wing designator as position 1
           and 2, the three-digit loader type as position 3 thru 5, and the five-digit assigned SN
           as position 6 thru 10 (e.g., FFALS12345 = ALS, FFLAL12345 = LAL, or
           FFUAL12345 = UALS). Units will update Ammunition Loader container locations
           in CAS.
           7.1.7.6.5. Alternate Mission Equipment (AME) to include Chaff/Flare Magazines.
           Load the two-position wing designator as position 1 and 2, the three-digit AME type
           as position 3 thru 5, and the five-digit assigned SN as position 6 thru 10 (e.g.,
 104                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


          FFL8812345 = LAU-88, FFA5012345 = ALE-50, FFCFM12345 = Chaff/Flare
          magazine).
NOTE: All AME container ID formats will be provided by HQ ACC/A4WA and loaded on the
AFMC2 site. Units are not required to update AME container locations in CAS.
          7.1.7.6.6. ISO Containers. Load the four-digit ISOs designator as position 1 thru 4
          (e.g., USAF or USFU) and the 6-digit SN as position 5 thru 10 (i.e. USAF123456).
   7.1.8. Weapons Expediters: During Sortie Generation Operations (SGO), Weapons
   Expediters (or designated weapons individual) manage munitions assets on the flightline.
   They validate and document of task data, process movements and expenditure transactions in
   CAS, and assure maximum aircraft coverage by organizing and positioning expediters
   spatially, geographically, or functionally depending on mission requirements and general
   airfield layout.
       7.1.8.1. The Weapons Expediter is a critical node in the flightline support and munitions
       accountability process through validation of aircraft load/expenditure accuracy.
       Expediters maintain 100-percent aircraft coverage and facilitate the use of automated-,
       direct-, or remote-input CAS processing to achieve streamlined data flow and near-real
       time and accurate CAS processing.
       7.1.8.2. The Weapons Expediter (or designated weapons individual) validates flightline
       task data IAW paragraph 7.1.4.2.5.2 prior to processing movement or expenditure
       transactions in CAS. Documenting weapons/munitions activity on the AF IMT 2434 by
       the Weapons Expediter or designated weapons individual indicates that this validation
       has been completed.
       7.1.8.3. Process flightline movements and expenditures in CAS using automated-input
       methods as the preferred method. If these automated-methods are not available or
       functional, use direct-input methods. Only use remote-input methods when automated- or
       direct-input methods are not possible or robust enough to effectively streamline
       operational processes.
          7.1.8.3.1. Aircraft Munitions Expenditures: The AF goal is to process aircraft
          expenditure data in CAS within one hour of aircraft recovery, but no later than
          between aircraft goes. Process aircraft expenditures IAW paragraph 7.18.2.2.6.
              7.1.8.3.1.1. Weapons Expediters may be unable to meet these processing goals if
              they must depart the flightline area to process expenditure transactions if
              infrastructure limits automated- or direct-input processing capability (e.g., lack
              flightline wireless or docking stations). In this case, munitions and weapons
              managers must decide which expenditure processing method best serves the
              mission.
              7.1.8.3.1.2. Processing Aircraft Expenditures using AIT: To support munitions
              expenditures using the HHT, the ORG/SHP code and Munitions CAT Code must
              be loaded against a specific aircraft (Container ID) data record. If the ORG/SHP
              code and Munitions CAT Code are not loaded the transaction will error out and be
              retained in the CAS AIT Conflict Resolution (AMP09A) program.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   105


Figure 7.1. Munitions Operations Flow Plan (Peacetime and Wartime).




             7.1.8.3.1.3. If AIT is available on the flightline, but temporarily off-line or out of
             wireless range, the HHT scanners will operate in ‘Batch Mode’ and continue to
             collect transaction data. When operating in Batch Mode, weapons expeditors
             must ensure that all ‘unprocessed’ Batch Mode transactions are synchronized
             (processed by gaining wireless connectivity or HHT docking) prior to processing
             movements to/from or expending assets from recovered aircraft.
             NOTE: Synchronizing ensures that transactions are processed in the correct
             chronological sequence, as they occurred.

   7.2.1. Establish a DoDAAC IAW paragraph 9.1.
   7.2.2. There is only one appointed MASO per DoDAAC. An alternate MASO is not
   authorized. As such, the MASO operates the munitions account and may pre-appoint
   delegates, in writing, to operate and manage account activity to include signing specified
   documents and listings. The MASO will sign the certificate of transfer and all inventory
   adjustments. Specific MASO accomplished tasks and authorities/responsibilities that may be
   delegated are outlined within Table 7.1, MASO Task Accomplishment and Delegations
   Authority. The MASO ensures required documentation is signed IAW Attachment 6, Table
   A6.1.
         7.2.2.1. The term “MASO will” indicates a task/responsibility accomplished by the
         MASO. These tasks can only be delegated when the MASO is absent from the duty
         section for at least one entire duty day. This ‘absence’ rule applies to MASO
         accomplished tasks listed in the left column of Table 7.1.
         7.2.2.2. The term “MASO must ensure” indicates a task/responsibility that the MASO
         may delegate even when not absent from the duty section. These tasks are listed in the
         right column of Table 7.1. MASO, Operations Element, or accountability tasks within
         this AFI not listed in Table 7.1 are considered ‘Must Ensure’ tasks and may be delegated.

          accompanies each level of delegation.
              7.2.2.3.1. If clear responsibility and authority cannot be maintained during a period
              of delegation, Munitions Supervision or the MASO should advise the appointing
              authority to consider transferring the account to a new MASO.

         7.2.2.3.2. Only an NCO, Officer, or civilian having a detailed working knowledge of
         munitions accountability procedures will be given MASO delegation. MAJCOMs
         may approve deviations to this requirement.
  7.2.3. The MASO must ensure that munitions owning and using organizations are familiar
  with the policies, responsibilities, and procedures within this instruction. In addition to the
  responsibilities outlined on the AF Form 68, the MASO shall ensure organizational
  commanders and custodians are aware of the Munitions Customer Information Matrix
  provided in Attachment 4. When used in conjunction with the briefing topics on the AF
  Form 68, this matrix replaces the requirement to develop a separate Munitions Customer
  Guide. Units who develop separate Munitions Customer Guides to aid customers will review
  and update these guides IAW AFMAN 33-363.
  7.2.3. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Contractor munitions personnel will conduct and document
  this training. The content of this training will be coordinated with the MASO and/or Chief
  COR.
  7.2.4. The MASO ensures processes are established to post munitions transactions in CAS as
  near to real-time as possible with a goal of 1-hour.
  7.2.5. Base-Level CAS System Management. Refer to paragraph 9.3 and paragraph 13.2
  for additional guidance on CAS management responsibilities of the Electronic Systems
  Center (ESC) CAS PMO (ESC/HGGI), NAF, MAJCOM, GACP and HQ AF. Base-level
  munitions supervision and managers will:
      7.2.5.1. Ensure all CAS base administrators are thoroughly briefed on specific computer
      training and awareness issues as outlined in AFI 33-200, Information Assurance (IA)
      Management.
      7.2.5.2. Appointment of Local Administrator. The MASO appoints a primary and at
      least one alternate local administrator in writing. Also see paragraph 2.6.9 and
      paragraph 9.2.2. Small and unique munitions organizations IAW AFI 21-200 need only
      appoint a primary SA.
         7.2.5.2.1. Standard memorandum format will be used and will identify the appointed
         individuals name, rank, DoDAAC, Unit, Office Symbol, DSN phone number, Portal
         Login ID, and Security Clearance.
         7.2.5.2.2. Forward a copy of the appointment memorandum to the MAJCOM SA.
         Submit new or updated memorandums as changes occur.
         7.2.5.2.3. The MAJCOM SA grants the primary and alternate base-level
         administrator the CAS Admin privilege if the local administrators Global Combat
         Support System – Air Force (GCSS-AF) IF logins are assigned and the appointment
         memorandum has been received and validated. If no local SA is assigned/available,
         the Lead MAJCOM SA grants base-level administrators in their absence.
             7.2.5.2.3.1. Once the administrative role is assigned to the local SA and appears
             in the SA Air Force Portal account, he or she will then be able to access the admin
             menu and have the ability to grant CAS privileges to other base-level users. The
             individuals appointed as the local SA will be the POC for all matters relating to
             the CAS application for their unit.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                               109


              7.2.5.2.3.2. The primary and alternate SA are granted unique roles; therefore,
              ensure a SA is available for daily CAS support as needed. The SA grants local
              users access to specific shop-related roles.
          7.2.5.2.4. The Base Level SA is required to validate local CAS user listing quarterly
          to ensure accuracy.

      managed within the MSA, Small arms Ammunition Combat Consumption (SmACC)
      issues to ORG/SHP 920CC, or for the single wing mobility account 002BP. Do not
      expend assets from ORG/SHP 920CC or 002BP, these are not expenditure accounts.
      7.3.1.2. The AF Form 68 will be used for all accounts established by units to manage
      RDT&E and A&S munitions assets IAW the exceptions to paragraph 7.1.2.1.2.
      7.3.1.3. A Commander (or equivalent) may request personnel not currently on an AF
      Form 68 be granted access to CAS by submitting a DD Form 2875 to the MASO. The
      MASO may approve and SA may grant access consistent with paragraphs 2.6.11 and
      2.6.12. The DD Form 2875 must contain the requestor's full name, grade, Air Force
      Portal ID, and duty phone number.

          7.3.2.1.1. Civil service (GS/GM) personnel appointed as Division heads/chiefs
          within a military unit may sign the AF Form 68 in lieu of the Commander. In
          contracted operations a military officer holding command authority or Federal
          civilian (GS/GM) Division heads/chief will sign the AF Form 68. Contractors do not
          sign to appoint custodians or approve the AF Form 68.
          7.3.2.1.2. Commanders / Civil Service (GS/GM) Division Heads/Division Chiefs
          may delegate their authority by memorandum to personnel with operational
          responsibility to sign munitions account documentation. A copy of the signed

              9 or above). Delegated personnel may act on the commander’s behalf to sign the
              AF Form 68 and other related account management documents that the
              commander would normally sign. Delegated personnel must sign the AF Form
              68, or an addendum to the current AF Form 68 to acknowledge being briefed and
              trained on their responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Commander.

              7.3.2.1.2.2. When delegating their authority, commanders and civilian division
              heads/chiefs remain responsible for these requirements and those of paragraph
              2.3. Delegation of authority does not release the commander /civilian division
              head/chief from pecuniary liability.
              7.3.2.1.2.3. The delegation memorandum must be signed by the appropriate

 “I understand that as Commander / Civil Service Division Head/Chief of
_______________________ (Organization and Office), delegating my authority for the
operations, accountability, and management of the munitions on Organizational Account
________ (ORG/SHP Code), does not relieve me of legal or pecuniary responsibility for the
proper custodial management and accountability IAW AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions
Maintenance Management for the munitions maintained on this account.
           7.3.2.1.3. DELETED.
       7.3.2.2. DELETED.
       7.3.2.3. Commanders may elect to personally receipt for munitions, or delegate their

       responsibilities.
       7.3.2.4. Active, guard, reserve, and civilian personnel operationally aligned within the
       same functional area will be combined on a single AF Form 68 (or addendum) regardless
       of administrative alignment.
       7.3.2.5. The MASO must ensure a ‘face to face’ briefing and informational training on
       account responsibilities is provided to the organizational or unit commander and all
       custodians by utilizing the AF Form 68, Part II, Briefing Statement, Attachment 4 of this
       publication, and the Air Force Munitions Accountability Procedures Guide (as
       applicable) located on AFMC2 site. For GSUs, the MASO may conduct this briefing by
       teleconference.

     approve establishment or continuance of a custody/consumption account. The MASO
     signs after all other individuals have signed and prior to account personnel taking custody
     of munitions. The MASO returns incomplete/inaccurate AF Forms 68 to the unit for
     correction before signing.
     7.3.2.7. Individuals cannot be added to the AF Form 68 once approved by the MASO.
     All custodians are considered ‘primary’. There are no alternate munitions account
     custodians.

     make any transactions pertaining to the applicable account.
     7.3.2.9. To withdraw a custodian’s authorization for any reason, the organizational
     commander/account custodian will take one of the following actions within 24-hours:
     7.3.2.9. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Munitions account custodians will contact munitions
     operations when an individual needs to be removed from an account. Changes to the AF

        revalidated AF Form 68 to the MASO. Additionally, Munitions Operations does not
        revalidate the unit’s AF Form 68.
        7.3.2.10.2. The custodian will initiate any required additions or deletions IAW
        paragraphs 7.3.2.8 and 7.3.2.9.
112                            AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


         7.3.2.10.3. The AF Form 68 will be re-accomplished any time the commander
         changes.
      7.3.2.11. Units shall use the folder structure as outlined in the AF Munitions Document
      Control Procedures at Attachment 6 for AF Form 68 distribution. Ensure that Munitions
      Inspection, Storage, SA, and custody account monitor have ‘read’ privileges for the
      account document folders.
7.4. Custody Account Management. NOTE: Custody account management procedures
include procedures to manage consumption issued assets.
  7.4.1. The Organization commander is responsible for munitions issued to the unit’s
  accounts. Commanders appoint munitions account custodians using the AF Form 68.
  7.4.1. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Units will ensure that at least two custodians are available
  on day shift to ensure timely communication and follow-up with the munitions contractor in
  regards to their account. Exceptions will be on a case by case basis, approved by the MASO.
  7.4.2. Custodians are responsible to the unit commander for property management and are
  liable for loss, damage or destruction of property resulting from negligence, willful
  misconduct or deliberate unauthorized use.
  7.4.3. Custodians will comply with all requirements identified on the AF Form 68 and this
  instruction:
      7.4.3.1. Ensure allocations are not exceeded.
      7.4.3.2. Obtain or provide transportation to pick up and deliver required munitions to and
      from the MSA.
      7.4.3.3. Maintain lot number integrity (i.e., do not mix lots). This is especially important
      for munitions items that the lot number is not affixed to the actual munitions item.
      EXAMPLE: Small arms ammunition in operational use loaded into magazines will be
      managed utilizing a cross-reference sheet that details the ammunition lot number loaded
      in each numbered magazine.
      7.4.3.4. Account custodians that must forecast for munitions will request and obtain
      general-user access to AMST.
      7.4.3.5. Ensure expenditures are validated and submitted within 5 duty days.
      7.4.3.6. Custody accounts will maintain packing material to repackage munitions
      maintained on their account. They will turn-in munitions residue, extra packaging, and
      containers to the munitions activity for certification or disposition. Those users
      authorized to certify munitions residue, as authorized by T.O. 11A-1-60, will develop
      procedures for disposal of packaging and residue, or pay for replacement packaging.
      7.4.3.6. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Residue will be controlled to prevent pilferage and
      will be treated as explosive until certified to be free of explosive material in accordance
      with T.O. 11A-1-60. Munitions Schoolhouses that are required to retain munitions
      containers to support training requirements will ensure that containers are picked up on
      the service provider contract for maintenance.
      7.4.3.7. Ensures munitions are not released to agencies or individuals outside the AF.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  113


      7.4.3.8. Initiate a formal CSA with the munitions storage activity when such storage is
      required or considered in the best interest of the Air Force.
      7.4.3.9. DELETED.
      7.4.3.9. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) All units (except Honor Guard and CATM) will return
      all expended munitions (i.e. smoke grenades, flares, brass) to the MSA with expenditure
      documentation as soon as possible after expenditure. Honor Guard will return ALL
      expended munitions to CATM to be consolidated. CATM will return all expended brass
      to the MSA, at least quarterly.
   7.4.4. Account Files. Account files are maintained electronically IAW Attachment 6.
   Custodians need not maintain separate files. If a custodian requires a specific record, they
   will request it from Munitions Operations.
   7.4.4. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Contact the munitions contractor for access to the electronic
   custody account file.
   7.4.5. Account Deficiencies. When the MASO determines that a custody account is not
   being managed or maintained properly IAW this instruction, the MASO will initiate the
   following procedures:
      7.4.5.1. Notify the organizational commander in writing and allot 15 calendar days to
      correct deficiencies.
      7.4.5.2. If discrepancies are not corrected within 15 calendar days after notification, the
      MASO must ‘freeze’ the account and no further transactions will be processed until
      corrected.
      7.4.5.3. The MASO must ‘unfreeze’ the account when identified discrepancies have been
      corrected or may direct assets be turned in. If discrepancies are not corrected within 30
      calendar days after notification, the using organization’s group commander or equivalent
      will be notified through appropriate channels for assistance.
   7.4.6. Account Closure.
      7.4.6.1. When the Organizational Commander has deemed the account is no longer
      required to support training or operational missions, submit an email with justification for
      account closure to the MASO. The MASO will then direct the closure of the account and
      forward the results to the MUFM.
      7.4.6.2. Custodians will package all assets for custody turn-in using the original packing
      material. If original packing material is not available, contact the Munitions Flight for
      packing material or guidance on otherwise technically suitable packing material.
   7.4.7. No munitions transactions will take place until all documentation has been received by
   Munitions Operations, unless the MASO has authorized a verbal issue request IAW
   paragraph 7.16.2.1.
7.5. Unit Forecasting and Allocation Procedures.
   7.5.1. Forecasting: Implement forecasting and allocation procedures based on guidance
   published annually in the PCAR memorandum distributed by the GACP.
      7.5.1.1. Missiles and missile components will not be forecasted.
114                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


      7.5.1.2. Forecasts, allocations, and distribution activity for CAS managed explosive and
      non-explosive NWRM assets is a coordinated process between the MAJCOMs; Air Force
      Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC), 708 NSUS, and the GACP.
         7.5.1.2.1. CAS managed NWRM is forecasted by units through the MAJCOM to the
         AFNWC. CAS managed non-explosive NWRM is allocated and distributed by the
         708 NSUS . And, CAS managed explosive NWRM is allocated and distributed by
         the GACP.
         7.5.1.2.2. The 708 NSUS reviews and updates requirements and allocations annually
         and submits approved allocations to the GACP for update in AMST by 31 July each
         calendar year.
         7.5.1.2.3. Account custodians that must forecast for munitions will request and
         obtain general-user access to AMST.
  7.5.2. Determining Proper Stock Levels.
      7.5.2.1. A unit’s allocation is that quantity of a munitions item expected to be available
      to units within the designated FY. The allocation provides authorization to requisition
      and use an item for its allocated purpose.
         7.5.2.1.1. The MAJCOM/NAF may review, realign, or adjust unit allocations based
         on theater positioning objectives, unit requirements and storage capabilities.
         7.5.2.1.2. The MASO is responsible for notifying the custodian when their approved
         annual allocations are available in AMST.
         7.5.2.1.3. The MASO at an installation will forecast for all CAS managed NWRM
         assets. In some cases, host/user command relationships may need to be established to
         differentiate between managing and using Commands. EXAMPLE: Trainers used by
         an AF Global Strike Command (AFGSC) unit but managed by a MASO assigned to
         AFMC on the same base.
         7.5.2.1.4. Each base’s portion of the Command Allocation Document is distributed to
         the MASO via CAS.
      7.5.2.2. The MASO ensures unit allocations are validated in CAS IAW the DLAR and
      MAJCOM/NAF instructions.
         7.5.2.2.1. Immediately prior to new fiscal year allocations being auto-loaded in CAS,
         validate proper host/user command code relationships in AMST and CAS. The
         MASO must ensure the following procedures are accomplished:
             7.5.2.2.1.1. Compare the Organizational Record Listing (AM513) to the AF
             Form 68 and AMST to verify that all ORG/SHP codes, host/user relationship
             codes, and Functional User Codes (FUC) are loaded correctly.
             NOTE: When functional units are organizationally combined/consolidated,
             unless the MAJCOM/NAF had directed otherwise, the MASO decides which
             FUC is appropriate.
             7.5.2.2.1.2. Once new fiscal year allocations levels are loaded, validate stock
             levels in CAS to ensure that allocations are accurately reflected.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                               115


            NOTE: Do not process new fiscal year expenditures until validation of new fiscal
            year levels has been accomplished.
            7.5.2.2.1.3. Immediately notify the GACP using the CRM of any host/user
            relationship or stock level allocation discrepancies.
        7.5.2.2.2. MAJCOM/NAFs ensure that unit forecasts and allocations are loaded in
        AMST by ORG/SHP code and FUC.
        NOTE: Do not consolidate allocations for Flightline support into to a single wing
        account. These allocations support specific ORG/SHP codes aligned to an AMU or
        Squadron. Units must continually manage these allocations to maintain timely
        processing, visibility, and accountability.
     7.5.2.3. Sortie Surge Training Munitions Allocations. Load levels against the ORG/SHP
     for the account but do not issue assets. Support sortie surge requirements from base stock
     assets.
        7.5.2.3.1. Munitions units may manage and expend CAT Code D and CAT Code E
        consumable assets as a part of the CRC directly from base stock. The MASO
        develops local procedures to strictly control these parts in production facilities as a
        component of the CRC.
        7.5.2.3.2. The MASO in collaboration with other munitions managers may utilize
        stock storage locations within the munitions maintenance and production facilities
        (e.g., build pads, maintenance bays, line-delivery, etc.) as necessary to enable stock
        management of these consumable assets. The use of automated-, direct-, or remote-
        input is encouraged to manage and expend these assets as individual parts or as part
        of the CRC.
     7.5.2.4. Units may be allocated munitions items in more than one CAT Code. Allocated
     assets managed on DoDAAC stock do not require physical segregation and are assigned
     the appropriate CAT Code at the point of expenditure.
     7.5.2.5. When stock levels are not sufficient to support total wing allocations, MASOs
     must coordinate with wing operational planners to determine priority of support.
     7.5.2.6. Units may maintain munitions, missiles, NWRM (e.g., TYPE Trainers) in excess
     of non-expendable allocations, provided the GACP/AFNWC has not tasked the unit to
     ship these assets, the unit has forecasted for the assets, or has submitted an OOCR. The
     MASO will ensure organizations have a valid requirement prior to approval. Once
     planned movements are satisfied, the MAJCOM/NAF must coordinate with the
     GACP/AFNWC to redistribute these excess assets.
        7.5.2.6.1. The MASO will approve/disapprove customer requests for excess non-
        expendable assets left on custody accounts. Maintain approved requests IAW the AF
        Munitions Document Control Procedures at Attachment 6.
        7.5.2.6.1. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Coordinate requests to maintain or be issued
        munitions in excess of allocations through email.
        7.5.2.6.2. Allocations in CAS will not be increased to support excesses.
116                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


         7.5.2.6.3. The MASO will notify customers of excess munitions requiring turn-in
         action by NSN, quantity, and CAT Code NLT 7 duty days after the allocations are
         auto loaded in CAS.
             7.5.2.6.3.1. Customers contact Munitions Inspection within 14 calendar days of
             MASO notification to schedule turn-in of excess allocations. Non-expendable
             and expendable excess must be turned in NLT 15 Nov.
             7.5.2.6.3.2. If a custody account fails to schedule turn-in of identified excess, the
             MASO must ‘freeze’ accounts and take action according to paragraph 7.4.5.
             7.5.2.6.3.3. Excess munitions expended after MASO notification will be
             processed using Out of Cycle procedures listed in paragraph 7.5.3.
             7.5.2.6.3.4. For non-explosive NWRM assets managed in CAS, the 708 NSUS is
             the approval authority for all changes to allocations. Once approved, the 708
             NSUS will coordinate with the GACP to change the DLAR using AMST.
      7.5.2.7. For CAS managed assets use the Supplemental Allocation Authorization
      Request (SAAR) system through the GACP website to support stock levels for items
      without an MSRC. This does not apply to RDT&E which will be managed IAW
      paragraph 7.25.
      7.5.2.7. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) SAARs that are loaded in the Air-to-Surface
      Munitions web site require electronic coordination through the unit commander to
      support the request. The email coordination will contain the following:
         7.5.2.7.1. (Added-SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Org/Shop Code.
         7.5.2.7.2. (Added-SHEPPARDAFBSUP) NSN.
         7.5.2.7.3. (Added-SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Nomenclature.
         7.5.2.7.4. (Added-SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Quantity requested.
         7.5.2.7.5. (Added-SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Authorizing directive and justification.
         7.5.2.7.6. (Added-SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Point of contact for the request (usually
         the custodian).
      7.5.2.8. CAD/PAD Time Change guidance. See paragraph 7.22 and 7.23.
  7.5.3. Out of Cycle Request (OOCR).
      7.5.3.1. Using organizations request allocation increases utilizing the OOCR process in
      AMST. Requesting units should contact their MUFM for guidance/assistance before
      submitting an OOCR.
      7.5.3.2. OOCRs may not be submitted for allocated expendable items until at least 70-
      percent of the allocation has been expended in CAS. Units will not report future
      anticipated expenditures to satisfy the 70-percent expenditure requirement. OOCRs for
      all other items and for OCONUS MAJCOMs will be reviewed and considered on a case
      by case basis. Sufficient justification must accompany all OOCRs. OOCRs for new
      munitions requirements (i.e. mission changes) may be submitted at any time.
      EXCEPTION: If End of FY expenditures are not processed in CAS prior to the FY
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                117


     cutoff IAW paragraph 7.18.1.5., then, if no ‘new’ FY allocation is available, the MASO
     will contact the appropriate MUFM who will support requirements with existing ‘new’
     FY allocations or direct an OOCR be submitted. If required, submit the OOCR within
     15-calendar days of processing the expenditure for the quantity of assets expended,
     regardless of the 70-percent requirement.
        7.5.3.2.1. Assets are allocated based on available and projected stocks and may not
        be 100-percent supportable. OOCRs for assets that were not 100-percent allocated
        may not be approved.
        7.5.3.2.2. Prior to submitting an OOCR for munitions other than aircrew training:
            7.5.3.2.2.1. The custodian will initiate the OOCR in AMST by citing the
            authorizing directive, formula, and expenditure data (as applicable).
            7.5.3.2.2.2. The MASO will validate the OOCR to ensure all required data is
            included and reported expenditures are accurate. If valid, the MASO may transfer
            allocations among accounts within the DoDAAC to support valid requirements
            (as required), provided the ‘Using’ Command Code is the same. The MASO
            redistributes unused allocations within the DoDAAC by completing the allocation
            transfer in AMST and CAS Allocation. Once the transfer is complete, delete the
            OOCR in AMST. Transfers must be processed in accordance with paragraph
            7.5.3.3.
            7.5.3.2.2.3. If the MASO is unable to support the OOCR, the MASO will mark
            the appropriate block in the OOCR in AMST. The request will then automatically
            be forwarded to the next review level.
            7.5.3.2.2.4. The MASO, MUFM, MAJCOM/NAF munitions staff will attempt to
            transfer allocations between functional areas within their responsible areas.
            Transfers from a non-expendable to an expendable CAT Code require approval
            from Air Force Security Forces Center (HQ AFSFC/SFXW) for ground
            munitions, Air Force Civil Engineering Agency (AFCEA/CEXD) for Explosive
            Demolition materials, and AF/A5R-C for air-munitions and associated
            munitions/explosive assets.
            7.5.3.2.2.5. If an OOCR is not supportable at the local level the MUFM with
            MAJCOM/NAF assistance will review and either finalize, forward, or deny the
            OOCR in AMST.
            7.5.3.2.2.6. The MUFM must work closely with the MAJCOM/NAF munitions
            staff and GACP to ensure approved OOCRs transferring allocations do not cause
            un-programmed/unnecessary munitions movements.
            7.5.3.2.2.7. All activities (e.g., MUFM, NAF, Lead MAJCOM, and GACP) will
            make every effort to source, move, and consolidate movements using the most
            economical means possible.
     7.5.3.3. Allocation Transfer Requests (ATR). The MASO after coordination with the
     MAJCOM/NAF MUFM submits ATRs in the AMST Forecasting and Allocation Module
     (FAM) to support Weapons Training Deployments (WTD), exercises, competitions,
 118                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


       demonstrations, test or training. Process ATRs IAW the below guidelines and the most
       current Accountability Procedures Guide posted on the AFMC2 SharePoint site.
          7.5.3.3.1. The losing MASO will ensure the unit has sufficient allocations to support
          exercise requirements and pass allocations to the supporting unit MASO not later than
          60 calendar days (CONUS) and 90 calendar days (OCONUS) before the exercise
          begins.
          7.5.3.3.2. The losing/gaining MASO will ensure the allocation transfer is processed
          in CAS IAW the Munitions Accountability Procedures Guide within 14 calendar days
          of the ATR date. The gaining MASO and MAJCOM/NAF will notify the losing
          MASO and MAJCOM/NAF of supportability by updating AMST no later than 7
          calendar days after date of the ATR.
              7.5.3.3.2.1. DELETED.
              7.5.3.3.2.2. DELETED.
          7.5.3.3.3. DELETED.
          7.5.3.3.4. The gaining MASO has requisition (stock control) responsibility for all
          increased or transferred allocations provided the time requirements in paragraph
          7.5.3.3.2 are met.
          7.5.3.3.5. After completion of the event (e.g., exercise, test) the host unit will
          complete the After Action Report on the GACP website not later than 14 calendar
          days after the event using the ATR number provided by the original transfer request.
          7.5.3.3.6. Within 7 calendar days of receiving the After Action Report, the
          losing/gaining MASO will process remaining allocations within CAS.
          7.5.3.3.7. Every effort must be made to support the transfer timeline, however it is
          not the sole basis for determining the level of support that can be provided by the host
          unit. The primary basis for determining if munitions support can be provided must be
          asset availability, not the transfer timeline.
7.6. WRM Aircraft Munitions Levels.
   7.6.1. WRM levels are managed and continuously compared to stock balances to assure
   WRM levels remain supportable. This requires continuous MASO and munitions
   management involvement. For CAS and warehouse management this AFI takes precedence
   over AFI 25-101.
   7.6.2. WRM munitions supportability is determined by comparing on-hand balances to
   WRM allocations, actively managing and monitoring levels, and communicating constraints
   with unit commanders, MAJCOM, NAF, and GACP. WRM assets are not segregated from
   other base stock assets. Physical assets are categorized as WRM (or other category) when
   actually expended for that purpose.
       7.6.2.1. Assets broken out and assembled for use remain on DoDAAC stock until
       physically expended. Once expended, process the transaction in CAS against the
       appropriate ORG/SHP code and CAT Code.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   119


      7.6.2.2. When WRM assets are stored at geographically separated locations (physically
      located at another installation but accounted for on the owning DODAAC), a structure
      may be loaded in the owning DODAAC CAS account showing the storage location and
      managed as a stock asset. The storing location will manage the item as a courtesy stored
      asset on an unaccountable record. (This applies primarily to units with limited storage
      capability.)
      7.6.2.3. Review WRM current levels on the Level Reconciliation Listing (AMC12A)
      against on- hand CAS balances to ensure WRM levels remain supportable.
      7.6.2.4. Munitions managers must train personnel to manage all aspects of WRM levels.
   7.6.3. WRM levels for CAT Code G and X may be provided by the NAF via a WCDO.
   WRM levels for CAT Code F and T will be provided by the Lead MAJCOM/NAF via
   AMST.
      7.6.3.1. Load WRM air munitions levels for CAT Code G, X, and Z against ORG/SHP
      Code 002WR. Load WRM air munitions levels for CAT Code F and T against the
      appropriate squadron ORG/SHP Code as reflected in AMST.
      NOTE: Allocations loaded against account 002WR are positioning objectives only and
      do not restrict munitions expenditure to support valid, WRM, combat, or contingency
      operations.
      7.6.3.2. Expend WRM air-munitions IAW paragraph 7.18.2.2.6.
   7.6.4. Munitions Supervision and MASO will brief the OG and MXG and notify the
   MAJCOM/NAF munitions staff when WRM assets drop below established levels. CAT
   Code T does not need to be briefed when levels drop due to operation support. The briefing
   must include:
      7.6.4.1. WRM asset posture by CR and component.
      7.6.4.2. Limiting factors and actions taken by the MASO to resolve shortages.
      7.6.4.3. Identify any requisition due-ins, planned use of theater pre-positioning, potential
      sourcing options (e.g., STAMP, APF, and tactical Fly-away assets) to meet requirements.
7.7. Base-Level Requisition Management. The requisitioning process is the method used to
satisfy munitions requirements and obtain allocated munitions for use during the FY. These
include stock level objectives; DLAR and TAMP; AWP; Unsatisfactory Report (UR)
/Deficiency Report (DR) for CAS managed NWRM assets; and/or approved ATR or OOCR.
   7.7.1. DELETED.
   7.7.2. The GAP working group determines call forward levels when positioning objectives
   are completed and recorded in the DLAR. Positioning objectives do not include projected
   expenditures or deliveries. Asset availability is defined as assets in the current AF inventory.
   7.7.3. The GACP/AFNWC (for NWRM) provides requisitioning guidance and directs
   OCONUS WRM munitions movements in coordination with MAJCOMs. Contingency
   sourcing will be IAW Chapter 11.
   7.7.4. Submit and manage requisitions IAW GACP or AFNWC (for NWRM) guidance and
   this AFI as follows:
 120                            AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


       7.7.4.1. OCONUS units will not requisition (call forward) WRM assets. WRM call
       forwards will be based upon transportation, funding, and storage availability.
       7.7.4.2. Do not submit requisitions for AIM assets. AIM allocations are centrally
       controlled by HQ AF and published in the DLAR, TAMP, MMP, and AMST. AIMs are
       distributed to bases by the GACP (Robins AFB) in coordination with the MAJCOMs and
       NAFs. For additional guidance see paragraph 3.10.
       7.7.4.3. Prior to processing or supporting requisitions, ensure:
          7.7.4.3.1. Required technical data and storage capacity is available.
          7.7.4.3.2. An allocation exists for the assets and requisitioned quantities do not
          exceed the allocation:
EXCEPTION: When ordering by quantity unit pack (QUP) or quantity per shipping container
(QSC) approved allocation (stock levels) may be exceeded.
          7.7.4.3.3. Requisitioned quantities consider current on-hand balances, validated due-
          ins, projected current FY expenditures, and approved ATR/OOCR. EXAMPLE: A
          unit allocated 1,000 each, has 900 each on-hand, and requisitions 100, however,
          usage rates do not support the need for 100 more.
          7.7.4.3.4. Detailed justification is provided in the CAS requisition “Remarks” field to
          support unique or specific requirements or when past expenditure history does not
          support the request.
          7.7.4.3.5. Requisitions in support of the annual DLAR includes the applicable FY
          that the DLAR applies to in “Comments” field of the CAS requisition. EXAMPLE:
          “FYXX alloc”.
          7.7.4.3.6. The proper Project Codes and requisitioning priorities are used.
          Requisitioning priorities are established in Table 7.2, Requisitioning Priorities.
          PACER AMMO project codes are identified in Table 7.4, PACER AMMO Project
          Codes.
       7.7.4.4. MICAP Requisitions (RDD 999): MICAPs are authorized only when lack of an
       asset will cause grounding of a MICAP reportable end item IAW the standard reporting
       designator (SRD) found in T.O. 00-20-2..
          7.7.4.4.1. Submit MICAP requisitions in CAS. If CAS is unavailable, submit
          requisitions IAW DLM 4000.25-1, Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue
          Procedures (MILSTRIP) and GACP or MAJCOM guidance using the “MICAP” link
          on the GACP CRM tool.
          7.7.4.4.2. Units with MICAP requisitions will contact the GACP via the CRM and by
          telephone as soon as possible after submitting a MICAP requisition in CAS (See
          Chapter 1 for GACP Contact info).
          7.7.4.4.3. The GACP will work directly with the IM and the designated shipping
          activity to facilitate the quickest MICAP processing to the requesting unit. Provide
          the IM and shipping activity with supporting justification, such as aircraft ground
          date, intra-theater support options, and any related communications.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   121


          7.7.4.4.4. Due to commercial transportation constraints at Hill AFB, on the last duty
          day of the week, field units must make every effort to submit and notify the GACP of
          MICAP requisitions NLT 0900 Mountain Time to allow MICAP shipments to be
          shipped by 1200 that day. If delivery is to be made on a non-duty day (Saturday), the
          receiving unit must provide the specific recipients name and phone number. MICAP
          requests received during non-duty days will be processed and shipped the next duty
          day.
          7.7.4.4.5. DELETED.
       7.7.4.5. The GACP will contact                the   requesting   unit   when      additional
       information/clarification is needed.
       7.7.4.6. Units will monitor requisitions weekly using the CAS Requisition Status Report,
       GTN/ICG, and AFMC Tracker. Additionally, reconcile requisitions to satisfy AWP
       actions with the Munitions Scheduling weekly.
   7.7.5. Requisition Follow-Up Support: Munitions Operations personnel contact the GACP
   via the CRM for requisition follow-up support. Units will utilize all available requisition
   follow-up/research tools prior to contacting the GACP.
       7.7.5.1. Sourced Requisitions: Follow-up monthly with the Ship from DoDAAC. For
       requisitions sourced to depots or DoDAAC FV2172, follow-up through the GACP via the
       CRM no earlier than 2-weeks prior to the RDD.
       7.7.5.2. New/Pending Requisitions: Contact the GACP via the CRM to validate/update
       status when in new/pending status for more than 14 calendar days.
       7.7.5.3. Backordered Requisitions: Contact the GACP via the CRM after the Estimated
       Release Date (ERD) has passed. The ERD can be found in the CAS Detailed Backorder
       Listing (AMI22A). For CAD/PAD assets not available prior to required installation date,
       coordinate with P&S to submit shelf/service life extensions to the applicable IM.
   7.7.6. The GACP is authorized to approve, disapprove, cancel/change requisitions based on
   changing/ competing priorities, trend analysis and/or unit input, transportation constraints, or
   worldwide (or theater) availability/shortages of assets when not economically feasible to ship
   (e.g., small quantities).
       7.7.6.1. When canceling a sourced requisition or unsatisfied RDO, the GACP will notify
       the unit by entering rationale in the CAS requisition “Remarks” field.
       7.7.6.2. When an ALC IM suspects an abuse of the priority system, the IM or PM should
       contact the GACP to validate the priority. The ALC IM or PM will not change a
       requisition priority without contacting the GACP to validate the priority.

   Additionally they ensure materiel accountability is properly executed within the DoD and Air
   Force IAW DoDI 5000.64, Accountability and Management of DoD Equipment and Other
   Accountable Property and DoDM 5100.76.
   7.11.2. Confirmed thefts, losses, and recoveries of AA&E will be reported IAW DoDM
   5100.76 and AFI 31-101.
   7.11.3. Inventories will be performed and recorded utilizing automated-, direct-, or remote-
   input; or CAS generated or manual inventory count sheets and the account will be frozen
   before the physical count.
   7.11.4. Inventories include CR or WSN assets on stock or custody account as applicable.
   See the Munitions Accountability Procedures Guide on the AFMC2 site for CR or WSN
   inventory procedures.
   7.11.5. During March and September, all CAS-managed NWRM assets, to include stock and
   custody, will be inventoried utilizing semi-annual DoDAAC inventory procedures provided
   in this AFI and in AFI 20-110. Initiate and perform inventories using the CAS Inventory
   Program (AM427).
   7.11.6. A special inventory of selected items may be directed by the MASO or higher
   headquarters.
   7.11.7. Properly secured containers, including ‘LITE’ boxes, do not need to be opened
   during inventories unless:
       7.11.7.1. Evidence of pilferage or forced entry exists.
       7.11.7.2. Quantity and other identification data on the container appear illegible.
       7.11.7.3. Assets require SN validation.
   7.11.8. DoDAAC Stock Inventories: There are three types of DoDAAC stock inventories.
   The annual, semi-annual, and perpetual Inventory; Monthly 10-percent Inventory; and the
   change of MASO inventory. These inventories include the following and will be performed
   as prescribed in Attachment 3 and below:
       7.11.8.1. All assets maintained on the DoDAAC stock account (serviceable and
       unserviceable).
       7.11.8.2. Personal defense ammunition issued to General Officers IAW paragraph 3.22.
       7.11.8.3. All NWRM assets (stock and custody).

          7.11.8.5.1. Semi-annual inventories will be accomplished in March and September.
              7.11.8.5.1.1. Depot accounts only require an annual inventory and will be
              accomplished in either March or September at unit discretion.
              7.11.8.5.1.2. The MAJCOM may waiver required inventory months, except for
              NWRM. Waiver authority for NWRM inventories is AFMC/A4 IAW AFI 20-
              110.
          7.11.8.5.2. The MASO ensures munitions users are aware of inventory dates. The
          MASO will publish annual and/or semi-annual inventory dates through available base
          media (bulletins, e-mail to customers, SharePoint sites, etc.). During inventories,
          only process emergency requests, submitted in writing and approved by the group
          commander (or equivalent). This minimizes transactions against the account during
          the inventory.
          7.11.8.5.3. The purpose of these inventories is for the MASO to conduct a wall-to-
          wall inventory of all munitions and explosives maintained on DoDAAC stock.
          7.11.8.5.4. A perpetual inventory is any method that results in counting the entire
          munitions inventory three times a year (twice a year for depot accounts). The
          perpetual inventory may be accomplished in place of and as a substitute for the
          annual and/or semi-annual DoDAAC stock inventory. EXAMPLE: Inventory 25-
          percent of the DoDAAC stock monthly (25-percent per month x 12 months = 3
          complete inventories).
NOTE: CAS managed NWRM assets, custody account assets, and non-accountable courtesy
storage assets are not included in the perpetual inventory.
          7.11.8.5.5. Units conducting semi-annual or perpetual inventories will reconcile and
          validate the following items at least semi-annually in March and September; or
          annually, in March for depot accounts.
              7.11.8.5.5.1. All outstanding AWM/AWP workorders against the CC-E and CC-
              G assets that the workorders are assigned to.
              7.11.8.5.5.2. ADR records against CC tags.
              7.11.8.5.5.3. CAS and TMRS records by NSN, quantity, and CC.
              7.11.8.5.5.4. CAT Code S container levels for containers maintained on stock.
       7.11.8.6. Monthly 10-percent Inventory:
          7.11.8.6.1. The purpose of this inventory is to identify negative trends between
          annual/semi-annual DoDAAC stock inventories. Conduct a 10-percent monthly
          inventory of the base conventional munitions account (to include depot accounts),
          except during months when a 100-percent DoDAAC stock inventory is conducted
          (March and September). Units will utilize the 10-percent inventory in CAS and other
          methods (as necessary) to assist in ensuring all assets are inventoried annually as part
          of a 10-percent inventory. Monthly 10-percent inventories:
          7.11.8.6.2. May be done by NSN or by facility. Inventories performed by facility
          will be considered a 10-percent, and will be treated as such, even though CAS will
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    129


          identify them as ‘special’. Validate AWM/AWP records/status for all NSNs selected
          for the 10-percent inventory.
          7.11.8.6.3. Exclude custody accounts, courtesy storage, and assets stored at
          collocated operating bases and alternate storage locations/sites.
          7.11.8.6.4. Monthly 10-percent inventories are not required when utilizing perpetual
          inventory cycle.
      7.11.8.7. Change of MASO Inventory: The outgoing and incoming accountable officers
      jointly review and validate results of the physical inventory of the DoDAAC stock. This
      inventory excludes custody account and courtesy stored assets. Waiver requests for this
      inventory may be approved by the MAJCOM.
      7.11.8.8. Sealed Structure Inventories (Including sealed ISO Containers): Sealed
      structures are not required to be opened for 10-percent, semi-annual, or change of MASO
      inventories. Inventory of sealed structures is at the discretion of the current MASO or
      on-coming MASO. For APF, inventories are only required for ISO containers that are
      being opened and inspected during reconstitution. Verification of structure seals is
      required during 10-percents that affect the stored assets and all semi-annual and Change
      of MASO inventories. For APF account transfers a physical inventory is not required at
      the time of transfer.
      7.11.8.9. Process all required transactions necessary to clear DoDAAC stock inventories
      (e.g., inventory counts, recounts, IADs) in CAS within 30 calendar days of inventory start
      (freeze) date. Process all required transactions necessary to clear perpetual, semi-annual,
      and annual DoDAAC stock inventories (e.g., inventory counts, recounts, IADs) in CAS
      by the last day of the month in which the inventory was conducted. Administrative or
      supporting documents (i.e., inventory packages) may be filed beyond the end of the
      inventory month. The MAJCOM may authorize extensions if additional research of
      accountable inventory discrepancies delays inventory completion.
NOTE: Change of MASO inventories may not align to a specific month. Therefore, these
inventory packages may be filed beyond the end of the month the inventory began.
      7.11.8.10. DoDAAC Stock Inventory Discrepancies:
          7.11.8.10.1. Discrepancies affecting the NSN, quantity, lot number, CC, location and
          corrective actions will be documented and briefed to the MUNS Supt/Munitions
          Flight Chief and Squadron Commander.
          7.11.8.10.2. If a munitions item cannot be initially accounted for (either gain or loss),
          or is not in the reported/documented location, immediately notify the MASO, conduct
          an initial physical search for the asset, and research the asset’s transaction history. If
          these actions do not locate the asset, do not determine the reason for the overage, or
          do not identify a legitimate explanation for the gain or loss (e.g., short shipment, over
          shipment, erroneous or unprocessed transaction), the MASO may be required to
          report the gain or loss to the Security Forces or Air Force Office of Special
          Investigations (OSI). Refer to DoDM 5100.76, Enclosure 11, Reports, Investigative
          Aids, and Disposition of Records for reporting criteria and timelines.
 130                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


          7.11.8.10.3. Forward stockpile discrepancies found during the inventory (e.g. broken
          metal banding, illegible markings, ballooned barrier bags, damaged containers) to the
          Materiel and Production Section/Flight Chief for resolution.
          7.11.8.10.4. For contract munitions organizations, the inventory discrepancies and
          corrective actions will be documented and briefed to the QAE, Administrative
          Contracting Officer (ACO) and Functional Commander.
          7.11.8.10.5. The Squadron Commander will sign the inventory results briefing
          memorandum. For contract munitions organizations, this will be the ACO or
          Functional Commander.
   7.11.9. Custody Account Inventories: These inventories include Quarterly Custody Account
   Inventory; Annual MASO Custody Account Inventory; and Monthly Inventories. These
   inventories will be performed as prescribed as follows:
       7.11.9.1. Quarterly Custody Account Inventory.
NOTE: Accounts that the MASO validates have only been issued consumption assets do not
require quarterly or annual MASO inventories. The MASO may direct inventories when DIFM
assets are delinquent to validate status.
          7.11.9.1.1. The custodian conducts a physical inventory of all munitions issued to
          their custody account once every 3 months. Copies of the current Custody Account
          Inventory Listing (AM507A) will be signed by the organizational commander and
          custodian and reviewed and signed by the MASO.
EXCEPTION: Custody accounts supporting AFGSC ICBM launch facilities are exempt from
quarterly inventory requirements. The inventory will be performed during the annual facility
periodic maintenance inspection of the launch facility.
NOTE: For NWRM assets, the semi-annual worldwide inventories conducted in March and
September satisfy the quarterly custody account inventories.
          7.11.9.1.2. The current reconciled inventory will be filed and maintained IAW
          Attachment 6.
          7.11.9.1.3. Discrepancies discovered during the inventory will be brought to the
          attention of the MASO immediately.
       7.11.9.2. Annual MASO Custody Account Inventory.
NOTE: For NWRM assets, the semi-annual worldwide inventories conducted in March and
September satisfy the annual, MASO-accompanied inventories of custody issues assets.
          7.11.9.2.1. The MASO will ensure account with custody assets is inventoried
          annually by qualified Munitions Operations personnel. This inventory may be in
          conjunction with and satisfy the requirements of a quarterly custody inventory.
          7.11.9.2.2. Process all required transactions necessary to clear the inventory (i.e.
          counts, recounts, IADs) in CAS within 30 calendar days of inventory start (freeze)
          date. Return the completed inventory package (e.g., Inventory Count Listing
          (AM427G) signed by custodian and Custody Account Listing (AM507A), signed by
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                             131


        custodian and commander) to the MASO within 15 calendar days of the date
        submitted to the account custodian. The MASO reviews, signs, and files.
        7.11.9.2.3. Document the results of the annual MASO inventory of accounts with
        custody assets on an inventory results memorandum. Manage corrective actions for
        account discrepancies IAW paragraph 7.4.5.
        7.11.9.2.4. The organizational commander, custodian and MASO will sign copies of
        the current Custody Account Listing (AM507A) and annual inventory results
        memorandum.
        7.11.9.2.5. The MASO must include the following areas within the annual inventory
        results memorandum:
            7.11.9.2.5.1. Compliance with established procedures.
            7.11.9.2.5.2. Custody account record accuracy.
            7.11.9.2.5.3. Inventory control.
            7.11.9.2.5.4. Proper storage procedures.
            7.11.9.2.5.5. Adherence to safety and security criteria.
        7.11.9.2.6. The current reconciled inventory listing and findings will be maintained
        until superseded by the next annual MASO Custody Account inventory.
        7.11.9.2.7. If the MASO has difficulty conducting off-base custody account
        inventories, they will request MAJCOM waiver.
        7.11.9.2.8. If approved, the MASO requests the commander of the off-base custody
        account appoint disinterested individuals (at least two, one of whom must be at least
        an E-7 or above (or equivalent) to perform the inventory.
        7.11.9.2.9. The MASO must provide the most current custody records/listings,
        associated forms and memorandums along with instructions (including procedures for
        relieving officers of accountability and resolving discrepancies), to the off-base
        commander to ensure timely and accurate completion.
     7.11.9.3. DELETED.
        7.11.9.3.1. DELETED.
        7.11.9.3.2. DELETED.
     7.11.9.4. Monthly inventories. The account custodian will conduct inventories of Risk
     Category I missiles and rockets maintained outside the MSA monthly IAW DoDM
     5100.76.
     7.11.9.5. Special Inventories: Conduct special inventories as directed by the MASO or
     higher headquarters.
     7.11.9.6. Custody Account Inventory Discrepancies.
        7.11.9.6.1. Discrepancies between accountable records and on-hand balances may be
        discovered during an inventory or while accomplishing day-to-day operations. In
 132                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


          either case, these discrepancies must be thoroughly investigated to determine the
          cause.
          7.11.9.6.2. If the discrepancy involves only lot numbers or CCs, the Inspection
          element will verify the correct information, and an AFTO Form 102, Munitions
          Inspection Document or CAS equivalent will be used as the source document for
          correcting accountable records.
          7.11.9.6.3. If the discrepancy involves loss/gain of munitions or explosives, validate
          the accuracy of the latest inventory data by performing recounts of all locations as
          necessary.
              7.11.9.6.3.1. Correct known warehouse location errors.
              7.11.9.6.3.2. Search base stock, munitions receiving and operating, and custody
              account locations.
              7.11.9.6.3.3. If the missing item(s) are not located during the search, review the
              transaction history to determine if a transaction error caused the out-of-balance
              condition. Transaction histories can also be useful in suggesting alternative
              locations to search.
                 7.11.9.6.3.3.1. Validate post-post transactions that processed prior to the
                 inventory or discrepancy.
                 7.11.9.6.3.3.2. If a shipment was processed recently, you would check with
                 the receiving unit to determine if they were shipped an overage.
                 7.11.9.6.3.3.3. If a turn-in was processed recently, check to ensure assets are
                 not in the inspection bay.
              7.11.9.6.3.4. If a physical excess is caused by an erroneous expenditure
              transaction in CAS, RVP the transaction, if possible. If it is not possible to RVP
              the transaction (e.g., previous FY, prior to previous cleared inventory), then
              process an IAD IAW paragraph 7.12. Attach a copy of the expenditure source
              document as supporting documentation.
              7.11.9.6.3.5. If a munitions item cannot be initially accounted for, or is not in the
              reported/documented location, the responsible custodian will immediately
              conduct a physical search for the asset and validate past transaction history. If
              these actions do not account for the asset, notify the MASO. The MASO may
              direct a special inventory, or conduct additional transaction history research, if
              warranted. If these actions still do not account for the asset or identify the reason
              for the discrepancy, the responsible commander or designated representative must
              determine if the loss meets the reporting criteria outlined in DoDM 5100.76. If
              assets meet these criteria, the responsible commander or designated representative
              will submit the required documentation IAW AFI 31-101.
7.11. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Inventory documentation (i. e. count sheets) will be
completed and sent electronically prior to processing. Every effort will be made to complete
inventory sheets in Adobe Professional with inventory quantities inserted. Count sheets will
be forwarded to the MASO, by the contractor, for validation.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  133


   7.11.9. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) All custody account inventories will be started and
   completed in the scheduled inventory month. In order to schedule their inventory, custodians
   will contact munitions operations by NLT COB on the 15th calendar day of the month that
   the inventory is due.
7.12. Inventory Adjustment Transaction (AM427J) Procedures. For NWRM assets, refer to
AFI 20-110, Chapter 12. In addition, when stockpile or custody account discrepancies exist that
could not be reconciled, the following procedures will be used:
NOTE: When processing inventory adjustments, no AA&E loss shall be attributed to an
accountability or inventory discrepancy if determined through investigation that the loss was the
result of theft, negligence, or inappropriate use. Any adjustment involving an actual loss must be
evaluated against the reporting criteria of DoDM 5100.76.
   7.12.1. The Munitions Operations element notifies the MASO of the discrepancy and
   prepares the Inventory Adjustment Document (IAD) package. The IAD package includes:
NOTE: When processing inventories, assets location changes (e.g., movements) will not be
updated as part of the Inventory Process (AM427A) unless a “total” physical balance
discrepancy. This avoids incorrect Net Explosive Weight Quantity Distance (NEWQD) updates
and ensures creation of a CAS transaction audit trail for all movement “from/to” locations.
Movements processed using the CAS Movement Process (AM104A) to correct asset locations
when no overall balance discrepancy exists does not require an IAD package.
       7.12.1.1. A memorandum endorsed by the MASO and Munitions Supervision providing
       a concise description of the IAD package. EXAMPLE: The description could indicate
       that an inventory was performed (if necessary), research was conducted, and a statement
       describing any evidence found indicating that a loss resulted from negligence, fraud, or
       theft.
       7.12.1.2. IAD Supporting Documentation:         Attach the following documents to the
       memorandum:
           7.12.1.2.1. Applicable CAS Transaction History (AM903) record.
           7.12.1.2.2. Inventory Count Sheets (for all types of inventories).
           7.12.1.2.3. Memorandum from MASO (stock), Commander (custody), or a CAS
           DR/SAN from the CAS PMO (CAS issue/problem ) that describes the corrective
           actions taken to prevent recurrence.
           7.12.1.2.4. Memorandum from the commander (or equivalent) approving or denying
           relief of accountability for adjustments that result in losses from a custody account.
           7.12.1.2.5. If applicable, include the following documents in the IAD package:
               7.12.1.2.5.1. DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss.
               7.12.1.2.5.2. AFTO Form 102, Munitions Inspection Document (or signed CAS
               document).
               7.12.1.2.5.3. DD Form 114, Military Pay Order.
               7.12.1.2.5.4. DD Form 362, Statement of Charges/Cash Collection Voucher.

              loss is reportable IAW DoDM 5100.76).
   7.12.2. Munitions Operations personnel brief the MASO on the IAD package. The MASO
   ensures the IAD package includes sufficient justification, and forwards the IAD package to
   the MUNS Superintendent or Munitions Flight Chief/Flight Commander.
   7.12.3. The MUNS Superintendent or Munitions Flight Chief/Flight Commander reviews
   and evaluates the IAD package to determine if flight processes and operating instructions
   require revision. After concerns are resolved, the MUNS Superintendent or Munitions Flight
   Chief/Flight Commander initials the IAD package and forwards back to the MASO.
   7.12.4. The NCOIC of Munitions Operations (or equivalent) prepares the IAD package for
   MASO approval or prepares the IAD package for MASO certification and approval by the
   MASO appointing authority as follows:
       7.12.4.1. An IAD that requires an ROS for relief of accountability will be certified by the
       MASO and approved by the MASO appointing authority.
       7.12.4.2. An IAD that does not require an ROS, will be certified by the NCOIC of
       Munitions Operations (or equivalent) and approved by the MASO. The MASO may not
       delegate authority to approve inventory adjustments. If the MASO is not available, the
       MASO appointing authority will approve adjustments that do not require an ROS.
   7.12.5. IAD Package Approval: The MASO or MASO appointing authority approves the
   IAD package indicating that they:
       7.12.5.1. Are aware of the discrepancies reflected in the IAD package.
       7.12.5.2. Approval of the actions taken to resolve the discrepancy and prevent
       recurrence.
   7.12.6. If the MASO appointing official does not approve the IAD package, the MASO will
   ensure additional research/actions are taken to mitigate the concerns to obtain approval or
   initiate a DD Form 200 if additional research does not satisfactorily explain any
   discrepancies.
NOTE: Except as noted in paragraph 7.12.4.2, ensure written approval is obtained from the
MASO appointing authority prior to processing an Inventory Adjustment Transaction (AM427J)
in CAS.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                135


   7.12.7. After the IAD package is approved, process the Inventory Adjustment Transaction
   (AM427J) in CAS and attach a copy of the approval and Inventory Adjustment document to
   the IAD package.
   7.12.8. At Air National Guard bases/units, forward all approved IAD packages to the
   USP&FO or Assistant USP&FO for signature.
   7.12.9. If a discrepancy involves finding more assets on stock than are on accountable
   records, thorough research must be done to determine the source of the excess items, to
   include inventorying custody accounts with like items on record.
   7.12.10. Assets adjusted from accountable records which are later recovered, but have a zero
   balance in base stock, will be picked up on record using ORG TIN procedures IAW
   paragraph 7.19.1.1. In this case, ensure mandatory documents outlined in paragraph
   7.12.1.2 and the Transaction History Listing (AM903) showing the ORG TIN to correct the
   account balance are added to the original IAD package. An ORG TIN turn-in to place items
   onto record must be supported in the same manner as described above to adjust assets off of
   accountable record.
   7.12.11. DELETED.
   7.12.12. Assets discovered that are not on record, have an unknown origin, and have a zero
   balance in base stock, will be picked up on record using Found on Base (FOB) turn-in
   criteria listed in paragraph 7.19.1.5. In this case, the mandatory documents outlined in
   paragraph 7.12.1.2 must be included in the IAD package, as well as a Transaction History
   Listing (AM903) showing that the FOB turn-in was processed to correct the account balance.
   An FOB turn-in to place items onto record must be supported in the same manner as
   described above to adjust assets off of accountable record.
   7.12.13. If discrepancy items do not meet criteria of either of the criteria above process an
   IAD to place items on record. An IAD to place items on record must be supported and
   processed in the same manner as described above to adjust assets off of accountable record.
   7.12.14. The final IAD package will be electronically filed IAW the AF ERM Solution
   Guide.
7.13. Manual Record Processing (AMC05A) Procedures. When Munitions Operations
personnel are notified of a discrepancy caused by an apparent CAS problem, they shall research
the error to determine if an existing CAS DR resolves the problem. If an existing the CAS DR
does not fully resolve the problem, submit a Trouble Ticket IAW paragraph 3.21.2. Use the
following procedures for Manual Record Processing (AMC05A):
NOTE: For NWRM assets, also refer to AFI 20-110, Chapter 12.
   7.13.1. If a CAS DR already exists for the issue/problem prepare the AMC05A package. If
   no CAS DR exists, Munitions Operations notifies the MASO of the discrepancy, prepares
   and submits a CAS Trouble Ticket IAW paragraph 3.21:
NOTE: A CAS DR is not required for C05 transactions to correct invalid DIFM created by
Custody Turn-in (AM555A) transactions.
   7.13.2. Munitions Operations prepares the AMC05A package. The AMC05A package
   includes:
 136                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


       7.13.2.1. A memorandum endorsed by the MASO and Munitions Supervision providing:
       7.13.2.2. A concise description of the CAS discrepancy/circumstances that caused the
       AMC05A package.
       7.13.2.3. Corrective actions taken to prevent reoccurrence if the error could have been
       prevented (e.g., not selecting the “DIFM Bypass” option for non-DIFM items).
       7.13.2.4. AMC05A Supporting Documentation: Attach the following documents to the
       memorandum:
          7.13.2.4.1. Applicable CAS Transaction History (AM903) record.
          7.13.2.4.2. If the “DIFM Bypass” option was not selected when processing the
          AMC05A transaction, include a discrepancy investigation statement with copies of
          erroneous documents which could not be processed as an RVP.
          7.13.2.4.3. Copy of CAS DR when AMC05A does not result from a DIFM
          discrepancy.
   7.13.3. Munitions Operations personnel brief the MASO on the AMC05A package.
   7.13.4. The MASO reviews the AMC05A package to ensure sufficient supporting
   justification is included and that the issue/problem cannot be resolved through the RVP
   process.
   7.13.5. Once the MASO approves, Munitions Operations submits the AMC05A package to
   the MAJCOM for approval.
   NOTE: Ensure written approval is obtained from the MAJCOM prior to Manual Record
   Processing (AMC05A) in CAS. The CAS Help Desk “recommends” corrective actions.
   7.13.6. Attach MAJCOM approval to the AMC05A package.
   7.13.7. The final AMC05A package will be electronically filed IAW the AF ERM Solution
   Guide.
7.14. Reports of Survey (ROS) Procedures. For NWRM assets, refer to AFI 20-110, Chapter
12.
   7.14.1. Regardless of whether or not a loss meets ROS criteria, an ROS must be completed if
   negligence, willful misconduct or deliberate unauthorized use of munitions is suspected or
   when the loss involves the following CIICs:
       7.14.1.1. CIIC 1 – Very High Risk (Risk Category I).
       7.14.1.2. CIIC 5 – Secret (Risk Category I).
       7.14.1.3. CIIC 6 – Confidential (Risk Category I).
       7.14.1.4. CIIC 2 – High Risk (Risk Category II).
       7.14.1.5. CIIC 8 – Confidential (Risk Category II).
       7.14.1.6. CIIC T – Top Secret (Risk Category II).
       7.14.1.7. CIIC S – Secret (Risk Category III).
       7.14.1.8. CIIC C – Confidential (Risk Category IV).
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                137


  7.14.2. In addition to the mandatory criteria above, you must submit a ROS for all
  adjustments to balances of stock and custody/DIFM/consumption account assets unless the
  adjustment(s) meet one the following conditions:
     7.14.2.1. DoDAAC Stock Assets: One-time loss of less than 200 items valued at $1,000
     or less total.
     7.14.2.2. Custody/DIFM/Consumption Accounts: One-time loss of CIIC 3 (moderate
     risk) munitions of 20 or fewer items whose total- value is $200 or less.
     7.14.2.3. Custody/DIFM/Consumption Accounts: One-time loss of a CIIC 4 and 7 (low
     risk) or U (unclassified) munitions of 200 or fewer items whose total value is $250 or
     less.
     7.14.2.4. An IAD or ROS is not required for Small arms Ammunition Combat
     Consumption (SmACC) issues when processed IAW paragraph 7.16.1.1.3.1. These
     assets are considered ‘consumed’ when issued. If assets are subsequently returned
     process appropriate TIN (e.g., FOB; expenditure) IAW paragraph 7.19.
  7.14.3. As used in the instances above, ‘one-time’ loss means each incident will be treated
  (reported and resolved) individually. In other words, you cannot group months or weeks’
  worth of losses and justify them under a single document. On the other hand, ‘one-time loss’
  does not mean that you will automatically initiate a ROS the second time an account loses
  munitions. Commanders and munitions managers must evaluate each incident/loss within
  the overall context of asset accountability. A pattern of irresponsibility or lack of adequate
  inventory controls is grounds for either freezing the custody account or initiating a ROS.
  7.14.4. The organizational commander of the account may allow the responsible individual
  to pay for the loss in lieu of a ROS, IAW AFMAN 23-220. In this case, the commander will
  provide the MASO with one of the financial forms listed in paragraph 7.12.1.2.5 to support
  the inventory adjustment.
  7.14.5. The cost of processing an ROS for small dollar losses may exceed any amount
  recovered. However, because of the sensitivity of munitions items, emphasis is placed on
  accountability rather than economy or efficiency.
  7.14.6. Do not submit a ROS for losses resulting from aircraft accidents and property lost
  during combat operations. Use the aircraft mishap report or a memorandum signed by the
  OG or MXG commander as authority for inventory adjustment. A copy of the report or
  memorandum will be filed with the inventory adjustment document.
  7.14.7. Commanders may elect to process a ROS regardless of criteria.
  7.14.8. See AFMAN 23-220 for ROS processing format, procedures, timelines, and approval
  levels.
  7.14.9. Use the ROS to substantiate adjustment of the DoDAAC stock balance, to
  recommend corrective action, and to determine the financial responsibility of the accountable
  officer or any other person involved in the discrepancy.
     7.14.9.1. Once an ROS number has been assigned, the certifying official (MASO) and
     approving official (MASO Appointment Authority) are authorized to sign the incomplete
     inventory adjustment package. This provides written approval to process the inventory
 138                            AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


       adjustment and close out the inventory in CAS. Once the IAD is processed and the
       inventory is ‘closed’ in CAS, the ROS and Inventory Adjustment package remain open
       pending 'final' approval of the ROS.
       7.14.9.2. DELETED.
   7.14.10. Whether or not an ROS is required, the inventory adjustment records must clearly
   identify and include all information relating to the stockpile discrepancy and support the
   adjustment as a ‘stand alone’ package. This package will complete the audit trail through
   documents identified in paragraph 7.12.1.2.5 to support the inventory adjustment.
   7.14.11. The criteria and actions described above for ROS and inventory adjustments also
   apply to munitions on the DoDAAC stock account or custody account which are damaged or
   destroyed for reasons other than fair wear and tear, authorized expenditure, aircraft loss,
   installation, or disposition. In these cases, the accountable officer or the account custodian is
   liable for the damage or destruction until relieved of accountability.
7.15. Receiving Munitions.
   7.15.1. Verifying Documentation. Personnel authorized to receipt for munitions will in-
   check assets. In-checking consists of comparing shipping documents with outer container
   markings (identity & quantity).
       7.15.1.1. When the received quantity, lot number or NSN is different from the shipping
       document, the in-checker will circle the erroneous information on the document, enter
       correct information and initial. Initiate research to resolve any discrepancy noted during
       the in-checking of munitions assets. Follow procedures in paragraph 7.15.3.
       7.15.1.2. Incoming ammunition shipments of nonstandard items received without
       sufficient documentation constitute a potential safety hazard to both facilities and
       personnel. Notify the MUNS Supt/Munitions Flight Chief prior to accepting these assets.
       7.15.1.3. All shipments received from another CAS account will be received on CAS
       accountable records before any other actions are taken.
          7.15.1.3.1. CAS does not currently transfer lot history upon receipt of assets at the
          receiving DoDAAC. The most current inspection history record from the shipper's
          DoDAAC must be manually entered after receipt of assets. There are two methods to
          obtain the Inspection History record:
              7.15.1.3.1.1. Method 1. Access CAS Lot History Inspection Report (AM615A)
              and updated the DoDAAC to the shipper's DoDAAC and enter the NSN and lot
              number.
              7.15.1.3.1.2. Method 2. Access CAS Inspection History Inquiry (AMQ05A) and
              change the DoDAAC to the shipper's DoDAAC and enter "Type of Asset" via the
              dropdown menu.
       7.15.1.4. All CAS managed NWRM assets will be received/picked up on CAS records.
       In addition, ensure that AFI 20-110 is followed for additional NWRM receiving
       requirements.
       7.15.1.5. For shipments received from non-CAS units (e.g., depot, contractor, vendors)
       with no shipping document number, in-check assets using the first 14 digits of the TCN
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                              139


     (if available). If no TCN is available, in-check the assets using a locally generated
     FVXXXX document number.
  7.15.2. Receipt Discrepancies: For NWRM assets, refer to AFI 20-110, Chapter 11. In
  addition, munitions received without sufficient accountability documentation, including
  COTS munitions, are processed as follows:
     7.15.2.1. Contact the shipping activity and request information/documentation is
     provided immediately.
     7.15.2.2. After all information is validated, prepare an off-line shipping document, DD
     Form 1348-1A, and process the receipt. Stamp/annotate the DD Form 1348-1A,
     “Shipping documentation not received”. COTS documents will be stamped “COTS
     Munitions Documents Not Required.”
     7.15.2.3. Prepare and submit automated Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) (SF 364)
     using the web-based DoD WebSDR as prescribed by DLM 4000.25, Defense Logistics
     Management System (DLMS) Manual, Vol. II, Supply, Chapter 17, Supply Discrepancy
     Reporting and AFJMAN 23-215, Reporting of Supply Discrepancies.
        7.15.2.3.1. If the DoD WebSDR system is not available, submit SDR using the
        manual SF 364. Submit manual SDR through e-mail or customer service help lines
        (e.g. the DLA Customer Interaction Center, dlacontactcenter@dla.mil), 1-877-352-
        2255 (1-877-DLA-CALL).
        7.15.2.3.2. Access to the DoD WebSDR requires submission of a System Access
        Request      (SAR)     available   at    the   DAAS     home     page    at:
        https://www.transactionservices.dla.mil/daashome/homepage.asp
        7.15.2.3.3. DoD WebSDR training can be obtained by login to the WebSDR
        application and navigating to the WebSDR training slides link.
        7.15.2.3.4. For a shipping (Item) discrepancy e-mail a copy to the shipping activity
        (basename.FVXXXX@basename.af.mil), the responsible ALC or ICP (ATTN:
        Appropriate IM obtained from the CAS IDR), the MAJCOM/A4W or equivalent
        (both if shipper and receiving MAJCOMs are different), and the local MASO.
        7.15.2.3.5. For packaging discrepancies, send a copy to the shipping activity, the
        GACP and packaging specialist IAW AFJMAN 23-215, Enclosure 3, SDR
        Distribution, paragraph I., Air Force or paragraph J.2., Defense Logistics Agency, and
        the NAF or Lead MAJCOM (both if different than receiving unit).
     7.15.2.4. Use the DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document or DD
     Form 250, Materiel Inspection and Receiving Report in place of the DD Form 1348-1A
     for munitions/missile shipments from contract facilities is acceptable. Units are not
     required to recreate shipping documents.
     7.15.2.5. When shipments are received or delivered by personnel not appointment or on
     an approved list, consult local transportation management representatives for
     guidance/approval IAW AFI 24-203. Refer to paragraph 7.17.2.1 for additional
     guidance for direct vendor shipments/deliveries.
 140                             AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


   7.15.3. Receipt Procedures. Assets are in-checked and receiving inspections (RI) performed
   IAW T.O. 11A-1-10. In combat situations, receiving inspections may be conducted as part
   of the assembly/ production process. Non-explosive NWRM receiving inspections are IAW
   applicable technical data.
       7.15.3.1. All Category I and II AA&E, and classified AA&E shipments will be checked
       immediately upon receipt to ensure that the seals are intact and for any signs of damage
       or tampering. If there are any signs of damage or tampering there must be an immediate
       inventory to verify quantities received and to determine extent of any damage or
       tampering.
       7.15.3.2. Process receipt details in CAS Receipts (AMI41A) or with use of CAS AIT
       Receipt menu.
7.16. Issues.
   7.16.1. There are two types of Issues: Consumption and Custody:
       7.16.1.1. Consumption Issues: Consumption issues are limited to those assets consumed
       or installed within 15 calendar days (i.e., DIFM, Time Change).
EXCEPTION: Shop stock issues, RDT&E activities, and SmACC issues are not bound by the
15 calendar day rule.
           7.16.1.1.1. If storage, security or safety requirements cannot be satisfied limit
           consumption issues to the amount to be consumed on the day of issue.
           7.16.1.1.2. Use consumption issue to support internal and external munitions (i.e.,
           CMT, Sortie Surge, and Load Barn) and RDT&E.
           7.16.1.1.3. Consumption issues include Small Arms Combat Consumption
           (SmACC), Stockpile Consumption, and DIFM:
                7.16.1.1.3.1. Small Arms Combat Consumption (SmACC):                     To issue
                basic/combat loads of 5.56mm and 9mm small arms ammunition only. SmACC
                issues relieve the MASO of physical and materiel accountability/liability for those
                assets and transfers accountability to the organization user and/or user’s chain of
                command. The following procedures will be used for SmACC issues:
                   7.16.1.1.3.1.1. Before processing any SmACC issue, each DoDAAC within
                   an active combat zone must obtain and maintain approval in writing by the
                   MAJCOM or NAF Munitions Staff (or equivalent). The approval must
                   specify the DoDAAC and the time period that SmACC issues are authorized
                   (e.g., month, FY, until authorization is rescinded). The approval remains in
                   effect for the stated period regardless of MASO appointment. Any rescission
                   and re-approval to perform SmACC issues must be through the
                   MAJCOM/NAF, however the MASO or local commanders may place
                   SmACC procedures in abeyance locally at their discretion.
                   7.16.1.1.3.1.2. Do not use SmACC issue procedures for any of the following:
                     7.16.1.1.3.1.2.1. Non-deployed operations:           Operating from the
                     individuals/units permanently assigned installation in CONUS or OCONUS.
                     Do not use SmACC issues to provide personnel deploying from CONUS to
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                               141


                 deployed combat locations.
EXCEPTION: AFSOC enabling or support forces may use SmACC procedures from CONUS
with approval of the MAJCOM/NAF Munitions Staff (or equivalent).
                 7.16.1.1.3.1.2.2. In-garrison operations (e.g., gate guards, routine base
                 security operations, nuclear weapons custodial duties, training, etc.).
                 Support these operations only from custody accounts established IAW
                 paragraph 7.4.
                 7.16.1.1.3.1.2.3. Any ammunition and explosives other than basic/combat
                 loads of 5.56mm and 9mm small arms ammunition used for personal
                 defense.
               7.16.1.1.3.1.3. Only process SmACC issues to the default ORG/SHP account
               920CC under CAT Code T. Units do not generate an AF Form 68 for
               ORG/SHP 920CC.
               7.16.1.1.3.1.4. Before processing a SmACC issue, obtain a copy of the
               individual’s orders and maintain with the original consumption issue
               documents. Maintain the personnel orders and consumption issue documents
               together IAW the AF RDS in AFRIMS.
               7.16.1.1.3.1.5. Relief from accountability occurs only after the physical assets
               are turned over to the user and the individual or organizational user has been
               briefed on and signed the following ‘acknowledgment statement’ on the back
               of the AF IMT 4331, MTS (or other issue document):
               AF IMT 4331 Acknowledgement Statement:
               “Persons receiving small arms ammunition must maintain control,
               accountability, and lot number integrity. The receiver will document all
               expended assets on the back of the AF IMT 4331, MTS. If it is impossible for
               the receiver to return small arms ammunition to the point of issue prior to
               departing the Area of Responsibility (AOR), the receiver will make every
               attempt to turn small arms ammunition over to another U.S. military
               authority or munitions storage area/supply point (e.g., Army, Navy, Marines).
               Only place small arms ammunition in amnesty boxes if there is no other U.S.
               military authority or munitions storage area available or if other U.S. military
               authority or munitions storage area refuses to accept the small arms
               ammunition. If turned over to a U.S. military authority or storage area,
               member will receive documentation showing who accepted accountability for
               the assets to include: Name, rank, organization, and home base DSN (Do not
               use SSN). The receiver is responsible to ensure this documentation is
               forwarded by any means available to the original issuing authority as soon as
               possible, but no later than 10 duty days after return to home station. Failure
               to comply after 10 days will result in the contact with the receiver’s
               commander. If assets must be placed into an amnesty box, document on the
               back of the AF IMT 4331, MTS, the quantity of small arms ammunition
               deposited, the quantity of small arms if expended, signature, and date and
               forward by any means available to the original issuing authority as soon as
142                         AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


               possible, but no later than 10 duty days after return to home station. Failure
               to comply after 10 days will result in contact with the receiver’s commander.
            7.16.1.1.3.2. Stockpile Consumption Issue: To issue assets from DoDAAC stock
            account for installation or use (e.g., replace AUR components, stuff containers).
            Process these issues against ORG/SHP 002SM. These documents will be signed
            by munitions personnel authorized to receipt for munitions assets. An AF Form
            68 is not required.
               7.16.1.1.3.2.1. The MASO may consumption issue an entire QUP of shop
               stock type items regardless of allocation quantity, (e.g., if an allocation of
               1,136 feet remains for arming wire, an entire roll of 5K feet is authorized for
               issue). Increase the remaining allocation Asset Level Stratification (AMG04)
               to allow the issue of the asset, then reset the remaining allocation to zero.
               Allocation increases above the initial QUP via ATR/OOCR are justification to
               issue additional quantities up to QUP.
               7.16.1.1.3.2.2. If unused pieces and parts remain from a consumption issue
               and the parts are no longer required, process an Expenditure TIN IAW
               paragraph 7.19.1.3 to inspect and return parts to stock.
               7.16.1.1.3.2.3. Units will ensure enough assets remain available on stock in
               CAS to support CR builds and expenditures.
               7.16.1.1.3.2.4. Use the consumption issue process for items requiring disposal
               of explosive munitions by EOD.
                 7.16.1.1.3.2.4.1. Use the “default” EOD ORG/SHP account 920RW under
                 CAT Code Y only assets requiring EOD disposal (see paragraph
                 3.13.11.3.2). Units do not generate an AF Form 68 for ORG/SHP 920RW.
                 7.16.1.1.3.2.4.2. Use the MASO correspondence memorandum, ‘Personnel
                 Authorized to Dispose of Munitions’ provided by EOD to validate personnel
                 authorized to sign and date the CAS generated document. Signature of EOD
                 personnel on the CAS document constitutes DEMIL certification. No
                 additional signatures are required.
            7.16.1.1.3.3. DIFM Consumption Issue: Used to issue high value and/or
            field/depot repairable and reusable assets when return of a like item carcass is
            expected. Unless otherwise stated, issue and control all ERRC code 'XD' assets
            using DIFM procedures. Do not use DIFM for any air-launched/dropped
            munitions and their associated inert/dummy/training assets. Use CAS DIFM
            listing (AM535A) to monitor DIFM assets to ensure they are returned within 15
            calendar days. The 15 calendar day count starts from the date assets were
            physically received by the customer.
               7.16.1.1.3.3.1. For initial issue requests use “DIFM bypass” Indicator.
               7.16.1.1.3.3.2. All replacement AFE munitions requirements, regardless of
               ERRC, will be consumption issued using DIFM procedures.
      7.16.1.2. Custody Issue. A custody issue is used to supply an organization with
      munitions for the current FY period.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                143


          7.16.1.2.1. DoDAACs supporting Air Force organic depot repair of munitions
          components, aircraft, and missiles (e.g., ALCs), and RDT&E activities, may issue
          ERRC code “XD” and time-change assets to custody accounts when supported assets
          are expected to be in repair, or used in support of test plans, for longer than 15-
          calendar days.
          7.16.1.2.2. Secure facilities and adequate storage must be available for all custody
          issues as outlined in AFI 31-101 and AFMAN 91-201.
   7.16.2. General Issue Procedures.
      7.16.2.1. Issue requests shall be submitted electronically to the munitions organization.
      The MASO may authorize verbal or written requests.
      7.16.2.1. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) When custody assets are used for technical training,
      the custodian must also initiate the equipment addition procedures with the trainer
      maintenance contractor to ensure the assets are maintained under the trainer
      maintenance contract.
      7.16.2.2. Munitions will be issued in QUP or ‘LITE box’ configuration when possible, to
      limit creation of ‘non-standard’ packaging not within SPI configuration, which creates a
      possible hazard class conflict as described in T.O. 11A-1-10.
      7.16.2.3. All issue requests will include the following:
          7.16.2.3.1. ORG/Shop code.

      custody issue requirement that may prevent a unit from performing its mission unless the
      munitions item can be issued and installed/consumed within 12 hours of issue.
          7.16.2.4.1. The MUNS Superintendent/Munitions Flight Chief determines
          supportability. If Munitions supervision determines the request is supportable no
          emergency issue approval is required.
          7.16.2.4.2. In cases of competing priorities (e.g., semi-annual inventories) emergency
          requests must be justified and approved, in writing, by the group commander or
          designated representative with command authority over the munitions issuing
144                            AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


         organization. The approval must accompany the issue request. Designated
         representatives must be appointed in writing and will not be lower than a unit
         commander.
  7.16.3. Munitions Pick-up Procedures.
      7.16.3.1. Customers receiving property must present a valid CAC or other DoD
      identification card. Only personnel listed on the AF Form 68 are authorized to receipt for
      assets.
      7.16.3.2. After validation that an individual is an authorized representative of the
      commander, the property will be signed for and released.
      7.16.3.3. The receiving individual will verify property received by checking the NSN, lot
      number, CC and quantity before signing for property.
      7.16.3.4. If changes have occurred to documents (quantity, lot number, etc.), the
      document shall not be signed and the recipient will notify Munitions Operations
      immediately.
      7.16.3.5. Responsibility for safety, security and accountability for munitions from the
      time of issue remains with the using organization. This includes lot number integrity.
  7.16.4. Organizational Refusals. Organizations refusing a previously requested issue of
  assets, must complete and provide proper Turn-In documentation for the refusal IAW
  paragraph 7.19. The refusing organization will sign the issue document and annotate
  “ORGANIZATIONAL REFUSAL” on the face of the document and provide a brief
  description of the circumstances surrounding the refusal. Organizational refusals may be
  processes electronically via e-mail, etc. MASO’s should notify commanders when their
  organizations have excessive refusals within a one year period.
  7.16.5. Issue of Non-NCAA WRM Small Arms in Support of Emergencies: The MASO
  Appointment Authority is authorized to direct (in writing) emergency issue of Non-NCAA
  WRM small arms ammunition to AF personnel for periods up to 30 calendar days to support
  disaster relief, humanitarian missions, and major accident responses. E-mail is acceptable to

        7.16.5.2.1. The NAF or Lead MAJCOM/A4 (or equivalent) may approve release of
        these assets for up to 180 calendar days.
        7.16.5.2.2. Requests for more than 180 calendar days must be approved by
        AF/A4LW.
  7.16.6. Supplying Small Arms Ammunition to Units at Deployed Locations:
     7.16.6.1. Supply small arms ammunition IAW the reporting instructions and final
     destination/line remarks on individual orders. Maintain a copy of the individual’s orders
     with the custody issue documents until assets are turned-in and receipt/disposition of the
     small arms is validated. Process custody issues IAW paragraph 7.16.1.2. Process
     SmACC issues IAW paragraph 7.16.1.1.3.1.
     7.16.6.2. The supplying unit (e.g., LRS, Munitions Flight, SFS) will ensure local written
     policy exists to ensure small arms are returned to the supplying unit while maintaining lot
     number integrity. The supplying unit will use the AF IMT 4331, MTS to document issue
     of all small arms ammunition and will be completed with the following information:
        7.16.6.2.1. Name of issuer, name receiver; home station, unit, and DSN; deployed
        station, unit, and DSN; NSN, noun, lot number, cartridge case markings, quantity
        issued, estimated departure date from Area of Responsibility (AOR), receiver
        signature, and date of issue.
        7.16.6.2.2. The issuing authority will provide the receiver a copy of the AF IMT
        4331, MTS and maintain the original AF IMT 4331, MTS IAW the AF RDS in
        AFRIMS. Ensure the issuing authority’s mailing address, FAX number, and
        organizational e-mail address is clearly printed on the AF IMT 4331, MTS. The
        MASO will ensure that AF IMT 4331 used for SmACC issues are maintained IAW
        the AF RDS in AFRIMS.
        7.16.6.2.3. Utilize the AF IMT 4331, MTS in conjunction with CAS Transaction
        History Listing (AM903) to screen and identify 5.56mm and 9mm small arms
        ammunition issued to ORG/SHP 920CC for CMRS. If restricted or suspended
        SmACC is identified, the issuing unit MASO will make and document attempts to
        locate and notify individuals/units.
     7.16.6.3. Every attempt will be made to return small arms ammunition to the point of
     issue upon departure from the AOR.
     7.16.6.4. The supplying unit commander will work closely with the base/theater
     PERSCO office and Numbered Air Force (NAF) to ensure in-processing/out-processing
     checklists for deploying/redeploying personnel include Munitions Receipt/Turn-in
     checkpoints. Munitions checkpoints must be validated through use of a ‘Stamp’ rather
     than initials/signatures to ensure personnel return issued ammunition prior to out-
     processing the theater.

7.17. Shipments.
   7.17.1. Integrated Data Environment/Global Transportation Network/Convergence (IGC).
       7.17.1.1. IGC provides in-transit visibility of munitions movements through the Cargo
       Movement Operation System (CMOS). An interface exists between CAS and CMOS (or
       IGC), however not all interfaces are functional (or may be disabled), therefore, at a
       minimum the MASO will ensure appropriate personnel maintain an IGC account to track
       shipments.
       7.17.1.2. Personnel with previous Global Transportation Network (GTN) accounts must
       reapply      for   an      IGC    account     at    the     IGC      homepage,     URL:
       https://www.igc.ustranscom.mil/igc/. In the event you do not have Internet capabilities,
       establish a local policy with your servicing transportation unit to provide access to the
       data to track shipment status.
       7.17.1.3. CAS managed NWRM assets will be shipped in CAS. Refer to AFI 20-110,
       Chapter 6 for NWRM shipments and Nuclear Ordnance Shipping Schedule (NOSS)
       Report of Shipment (REPSHIP) procedures.
   7.17.2. Processing Shipments.
       7.17.2.1. The transportation office must provide the MASO with a list of individuals
       authorized to receipt for munitions and explosive items, including classified items to be
       released to the transportation movement officer for shipment. For organic movements,
       the gaining MASO must provide a list of authorized personnel to the losing MASO for
       receipt of munitions. To release shipped munitions directly to a government vendor (e.g.,
       Raytheon, Honeywell, ATK) the applicable SPO/PM for the materiel must approve and
       forward a list of authorized personnel to the releasing MASO. The SPO/PM is
       responsible to obtain the list from the vendor, approve it, and forward the approved list to
       each appropriate MASO.
       7.17.2.2. The lists must contain name, rank, and security clearance for each authorized
       individual. Signature specimens will also be provided on this list or provided on an
       attached signature card with printed name and date of signature. Update the list as
       changes occur and re-accomplish annually.
          7.17.2.2.1. The authorization list is required regardless of digital signature capability,
          however if the local transportation office has the capability to digitally sign and
          receipt for munitions and explosive items being shipped, then no signature specimen
          is required on the list.
          7.17.2.2.2. In the event digital signature capability is lost or post-post and manual
          procedures are implemented, obtain signature specimens and actual signatures for all
          munitions/explosive shipments.
          NOTE: Signature specimens are used to validate current shipment documents only.
          Signature specimens are not required/maintained to validate historical shipment
          documents. These were validated at the point of shipment.
       7.17.2.3. Do not release munitions items to transportation unless the individual appears
       on the current listing.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                147


     7.17.2.4. Transportation personnel need not sign a shipping document unless it is
     processed through the transportation activity. EXAMPLE: Munitions moved by
     munitions personnel from base-A to base-B.
     7.17.2.5. When assets require shipment for return and repair, use instructions issued by
     the IM or SPO as direction and guidance for the shipment.
     7.17.2.6. When tasked to ship MICAP and priority 02, shipment of less than QUP is
     authorized. Turn the documentation over to transportation within 24 hours.
     7.17.2.7. Units will review the Unsatisfied RDO Listing (AM124A) daily. This listing
     serves as authority to ship assets. Units unable to support requests, contact the GACP
     and get approval to deny the RDO. Once the GACP approves the denial, the unit will
     process an RDO denial in the RDO Shipment (AM123A) program.
     7.17.2.8. Once the property is released to or scheduled with the servicing transportation
     unit, update the CAS in-transit record indicating date sent to transportation and estimated
     ship date. Update the DDO via the Manage Intransits (AMI07A) or the Inquire and
     Update Outbounds (AMI08A) screens when shipments physically depart station.
     Additionally, update the TMRS In-transit Record for the shipment by inputting the
     physical departure date.
  7.17.3. Accounting for Munitions In-Transit:
     7.17.3.1. Munitions activities shall retain accountability of munitions assets placed in an
     intransit status until the actual DDO. IAW DLM 4000.25, Vol. 2, Supply Standard
     Procedures, Chapter 4, Requisitioning, storage activities shipping assets to satisfy
     requisitions are responsible to provide shipment status to the appropriate Source of
     Supply (e.g., GACP) when required/requested.
     7.17.3.2. When the shipping Munitions activity selects assets for shipment they are
     loaded to the CAS Intransit Asset Table. When the shipping Munitions activity updates
     the DDO in CAS, the local DoDAAC, location and structure are removed from the assets.
     7.17.3.3. Ensure all intransit shipments temporarily stored within the MSA that did not
     originate from that base DoDAAC are loaded and managed in CAS using the Non-
     Accountable (AM101A) program. Also, manage shipments erroneously DDO’d or
     shipments dropped off of record using AM101A. When these shipment actually depart
     the installation, clear these assets from the Non-accountable program (AM101A). These
     intransits will be validated during the weekly shipment reconciliation.
     7.17.3.4. When CAS is not available at the shipping or receiving installation, the MASO
     must keep the servicing MAJCOM/NAF and the GACP apprised of the shipment status
     via any expedient and accurate means (e.g., official e-mail (digitally signed and
     encrypted), fax, etc.).
     7.17.3.5. Shipments between Air Force activities:
         7.17.3.5.1. Munitions shipped from one Air Force FV DoDAAC to another FV
         DoDAAC will remain in the CAS Intransit Asset Table until received by the
         destination activity. Refer to paragraph 7.17.3.7 for all classified and sensitive
         munitions shipments regardless of origin or destination.
148                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


         7.17.3.5.2. Reconcile and document status of all outstanding shipments, by TCN,
         with the transportation activity.
         7.17.3.5.3. Verify the DDO in CAS once assets physically depart installation. For
         assets not updated by CMOS, process the DDO action manually in CAS.
         NOTE: At installations with aerial ports, the CMOS – CAS interface may have been
         disabled due to erroneous DDO feeds from CMOS. In these cases, the DDO must be
         updated manually.
         7.17.3.5.4. When assets are received in CAS by the destination Munitions activity,
         the assets will automatically drop off the CAS Intransit Asset Table and be picked up
         on the receiving FV DoDAAC account record.
         7.17.3.5.5. Munitions activities are responsible to actively follow-up by reviewing
         and monitoring the CAS Intransit Assets. If problems are suspected or noted, unit
         shippers and receivers will initiate communications (e.g., telephone, e-mail, CRM as
         appropriate) with the origin/destination, NAF, Lead MAJCOM, or GACP as
         appropriate to identify and resolve problems.
         7.17.3.5.6. In the event the recipient does not receive the material by the RDD, the
         recipient must follow-up through the transportation activity/unit if the DDO is not
         greater than 30 days. If the DDO is greater than 30 days, the recipient must initiate
         tracer action with transportation unit and/or Source of Supply using the TCN.
         Follow-up timelines for classified and sensitive munitions are IAW paragraph
         7.17.3.7.
      7.17.3.6. Shipments to Non-Air Force Activities: Munitions shipment records to non-Air
      Force activities (e.g., retail/wholesale depots, manufacturer/contract repair facilities,
      other services/federal agencies) will automatically ‘clear’ from the CAS Intransit Asset
      Table 30 days after the DDO is updated in CAS.
      NOTE: Intransit records for classified and sensitive munitions categories identified in
      paragraph 7.17.3.7. do not automatically clear. These records are cleared by the GACP.
      7.17.3.7. Classified and Sensitive Munitions Shipments: The loss, theft, unlawful
      disposition, and/or recovery of Classified and Sensitive munitions require investigation
      IAW DLM 4000.25-2, Military Standard Transaction Reporting and Accounting
      Procedures (MILSTRAP) Manual. This requires a higher level of oversight to validate
      that shipment of classified and sensitive munitions are actually received at the intended
      destination before clearing shipments from the CAS Intransit Asset Table.
         7.17.3.7.1. Receipt validation applies to the following Classified and Sensitive Item
         categories:
             7.17.3.7.1.1. CIIC 1 – Very High Risk (Category I).
             7.17.3.7.1.2. CIIC 2 – High Risk (Category II).
             7.17.3.7.1.3. CIIC 5 – Secret (Category I).
             7.17.3.7.1.4. CIIC 6 – Confidential (Category I).
             7.17.3.7.1.5. CIIC 8 – Confidential (Category II).
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                            149


          7.17.3.7.1.6. CIIC C – Confidential.
          7.17.3.7.1.7. CIIC S – Secret.
          7.17.3.7.1.8. CIIC T – Top Secret.
       7.17.3.7.2. There are two methods to accomplish receipt validation depending on the
       origin/destination of the shipment. 1) Receipt at an AF DoDAAC using the original
       CAS TCN or 2) GACP centrally validates shipment receipt and closes the Intransit
       record.
          7.17.3.7.2.1. Shipments between Air Force DoDAACs:                MASOs at AF
          installations receiving classified or sensitive munitions from other AF
          installations will receipt assets in CAS following normal receipt procedures which
          will clear intransit records from the CAS Intransit Asset Table.
              7.17.3.7.2.1.1. Ensure all classified and sensitive munitions assets are
              receipted properly using the CAS TCN. Receipt in CAS constitutes proper
              ‘validation’ only when the receipt is processed using the CAS TCN and the
              shipment is cleared from the CAS Intransit Asset Table. Personnel receiving
              these classified and sensitive assets are responsible to the MASO to validate
              the shipment was cleared from the CAS Intransit Asset Table.
              7.17.3.7.2.1.2. If the CAS TCN cannot be used or the CAS Intransit Asset
              Table did not properly clear the shipment, receive these assets using a local
              TCN, and immediately notify the GACP through the CRM and report the
              following information:
                7.17.3.7.2.1.2.1. Reason CAS TCN could not be used.
                7.17.3.7.2.1.2.2. Original CAS TCN (if any).
                7.17.3.7.2.1.2.3. Local TCN used to receipt assets.
                7.17.3.7.2.1.2.4. NSN.
                7.17.3.7.2.1.2.5. Quantity.
                7.17.3.7.2.1.2.6. Full Name, Organization, and DSN of personnel
                processing receipt in CAS.
              7.17.3.7.2.1.3. Once this data is received, the GACP will close the intransit
              record.
          7.17.3.7.2.2. Shipments to Non-Air Force Activities: The GACP will develop
          internal processes to validate receipt of assets and clear the CAS Intransit Asset
          Table records.
              7.17.3.7.2.2.1. GACP validation of classified and sensitive munitions
              shipments requires that each receiver acknowledge verbally, in writing, via e-
              mail (digital signature), or through other automated means (CAS, other
              application) that the shipped TCN, NSN, and quantity was actually received,
              and the date assets were received.
              7.17.3.7.2.2.2. Validation will be performed on all classified and sensitive

                  shipments that exceed the Estimated Delivery Date (EDD) or go beyond 30-
                  days from the DDO.
   7.17.4. Assign PACER AMMO project code IAW Table 7.4.
       7.17.4.1. PACER AMMO is the AF program to monitor and track worldwide munitions
       transportation costs using HQ AFMC managed SDT funds IAW paragraph 15.6.
       7.17.4.2. The program has two categories; ‘Must Pays’ and ‘Prioritized’ based on the
       MMP developed by the GAP Working Group. The categories are further broken down
       by project code IAW Table 7.4. PACER AMMO budgets for SDT funds to cover the
       ‘Must Pay’ category which must not be exceeded. The program does not include the
       shipment of munitions in support of warfighter contingency operations (including ANG)
       identified by a 9XX project code. All peacetime munitions shipments must be assigned a
       project code IAW Table 7.4.
   7.17.5. The shipping activity will identify the appropriate Transportation Account Code
   (TAC) as follows:
       7.17.5.1. F8RT. Used for movement of missiles and associated components governed by
       the TAMP.
       7.17.5.2. F8UT. Used for movement of conventional and precision guided munitions
       governed by the DLAR .
       7.17.5.3. For munitions shipments not governed by the DLAR or TAMP, the activity
       directing or requesting the shipment (e.g., MAJCOM, NAF, unit) will provide the
       shipping activity with an appropriate TAC or identify/direct the source of funding to be
       used (e.g., MAJCOM, shipping unit) within their authority and funding line of
       accounting.
NOTE: Unless otherwise stated, the GACP is not the directing/requesting activity for shipments
not covered by the TAMP/DLAR.
          7.17.5.3.1. Munitions requisitions requested by the ANG are not a part of the
          PACER AMMO Program. ANG TAC F8E0 will be used to fund all ANG shipments
          from depots and active duty units to ANG bases/units. ANG shipments between
          ANG bases will be funded using local O&M funds or other ANG TACs directed by
          NGB/A4RDT.
          7.17.5.3.2. Munitions shipments directed by the GACP from ANG bases to active
          duty units will use the PACER AMMO TACs and project codes IAW Table 7.4.
          NOTE: Munitions and missile shipments directed by the GACP to support ANG
          deployments or contingency operations may use PACER AMMO TACs and
          contingency project codes.
          7.17.5.3.3. For additional guidance on conventional munitions shipments to, from,
          and between ANG units refer to AFI 24-203.
       7.17.5.4. Air National Guard Transportation:
          7.17.5.4.1. Munitions requisitions requested by the ANG and shipments related to
          ANG ADRs, maintenance returns and CAD/PAD are not supported by the PACER
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                 151


          AMMO Program. ANG TAC F8E0 will be used to fund all ANG shipments from
          depots and active duty units to ANG bases/units. ANG shipments between ANG
          bases will be funded using local O&M funds or other ANG TACs directed by
          NGB/A4RDT.
          7.17.5.4.2. Munitions shipments directed by the GACP from ANG bases to active
          duty units will use the PACER AMMO TACs and project codes IAW Table 7.4.
NOTE: Munitions and missile shipments directed by the GACP to support ANG deployments or
contingency operations may use PACER AMMO TACs and contingency project codes.
          7.17.5.4.3. For additional guidance on conventional munitions shipments to, from,
          and between ANG units refer to AFI 24-203.
   7.17.6. ISO Container shipments:
      7.17.6.1. DELETED.
      7.17.6.2. Prior-to-use inspections will be performed before loading munitions for
      shipment and will consist of a visual interior and exterior examination for obvious
      defects.
      7.17.6.3. DELETED.
      7.17.6.4. DELETED.
          7.17.6.4.1. Shipments of munitions using ISO containers that originate from
          munitions activities will attach CAS shipping documents and the Mass Shipment
          Report (AMI25R) to the inside of a door on each container. Attach the original-
          signed DA Form 2404 to the inside of a door on each container and maintain a copy
          of the DA Form 2404 IAW DTR 4500.9-R.
          7.17.6.4.2. DELETED.
      7.17.6.5. AIT capable units will label container and contents as required. Labels will be
      placed on the door near the consolidated data plate.
      7.17.6.6. Ensure all applicable DOT markings are properly affixed.
      7.17.6.7. RFID tags are detached from the outer container surface and reattached to the
      inside of the container door or consolidated into a central location immediately upon
      removal of assets. Reverse the battery to deactivate the tag prior to placing it inside the
      container. This prevents the container from being tracked as a loaded container in the
      transportation system.
      7.17.6.8. Ensure intermodal containers prepared for shipment of munitions or used for
      storage are loaded using CAS Container Maintenance (AM106A) program as an “ISO”
      type container. ISO type container numbers will follow this format: USAF0018745.
      Any intermodal container used in MASS shipment procedures will be loaded using CnC
      management procedures IAW paragraph 7.1.7.
   7.17.7. FMS Shipments.
  152                              AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


          7.17.7.1. When assets are authorized for release IAW paragraph 9.6 as an approved
          FMS case ensure all shipping documents are annotated with "Released IAW FMS-CASE
          XXXX” and attach copies of authorizing correspondence.
          7.17.7.2. When an existing Acquisition Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) authorizes
          the release of FMS assets, and the MAJCOM/NAF A4 (or equivalent) has approved the
          release, annotate all documents with “Released IAW ACSA” and attach copies of
          authorizing correspondence to the shipping documents.
      7.17.8. Cancelled Shipments: When a shipment is processed in CAS but does not depart the
      installation (e.g., DDO is not updated), the shipment can be cancelled if necessary. Do not
      RVP the shipment in CAS. Personnel process a shipment cancellation IAW the Munitions
      Accountability Procedures Guide. The document may be cleared from the AME01A screen
      in CAS without filing.

7.18. Expenditures.
   7.18.1. General. Expenditures are processed to account for and document physical
   consumption of DoDAAC stock account and custody account munitions.
       7.18.1.1. Units will not use the Structure Expenditure (AM723A) process to remove
       assets from accountable record when aircraft depart/deploy from home station with
       munitions. Refer to paragraph 7.20, Deployed Munitions Management for these items.
       7.18.1.2. Ensure no one expends WRM munitions in peacetime without approval IAW
       AFI 25-101. This includes munitions positioned in support of allocations for Cat Codes
       B, F, G, M, X, and Z.
       7.18.1.3. Only after assets are physically expended are they designated against and
       allocation category (including WRM), therefore, do not segregate munitions in stock
       based on allocated category/quantity.
       7.18.1.4. Continuously monitor WRM munitions supportability by monitoring on-hand
       balances to WRM allocations and requisitions to achieve WRM munitions levels.
       7.18.1.5. All End of FY expenditures must be processed in CAS prior to 2400 hours,
       Central Standard Time (CST) on 30 September. If expenditures are not processed prior
       to this cutoff, they will be processed against new FY allocations and an OOCR will be
       processed for the quantity of assets expended IAW paragraph 7.5.3.
   7.18.2. Expenditures fall into two categories.   Either Custody Account expenditures or
   Stockpile Record Account expenditures.
       7.18.2.1. Custody Account Expenditures: The consuming organization or activity
       provides the MASO with electronic expenditure requests within 5 duty days of
       expenditure. Refer to paragraph 7.4 for Custody Account Management procedures.
          7.18.2.1.1. Custodians will include the following on expenditure requests:
              7.18.2.1.1.1. Nomenclature.
              7.18.2.1.1.2. NSN.

              commander.
          7.18.2.1.2. SOCOM and AFCENT munitions units supporting non-traditional
          operations may manage and expend assets from custody account with
          AFSOC/AFCENT approval.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                               155


       7.18.2.2. Expenditures from DoDAAC Stock. Used to process expenditures for assets
       managed directly from the DoDAAC stock account. This is not utilized for custody
       managed assets and generally is only used for munitions managed internally by the
       MASO and Munitions unit/activity.
          7.18.2.2.1. Personnel performing munitions tasks and operations (e.g., munitions
          crews, weapons expeditors) process expenditures in CAS using automated-, direct-,
          or remote-input methods IAW paragraph 7.1.4.3.
          7.18.2.2.2. Munitions assets staged, assembled, and configured for delivery/or use
          remain on the DoDAAC stock account until physically expended. Once physically
          expended, assets are expended in CAS against the appropriate CAT Code and
          ORG/SHP code.
          7.18.2.2.3. After expenditures from DoDAAC stock are processed in CAS, the
          MASO will validate that these transactions were processed correctly by comparing
          the CAS Transaction History Listing, AM903 against the AF IMT 2434, AF IMT
          4331, MTS and/or other documents. Discrepancies must be researched and corrected.
          7.18.2.2.4. Controlling Expenditures from the DoDAAC Stock Account: Control
          these expenditures through active and continuous allocation and inventory
          management. Utilize the Level Reconciliation Listing (AMC12A) and CAS
          generated reports to ensure peacetime assets are not expended without an approved
          allocation.
NOTE: It is not necessary to load or manage levels for valid WRM, combat, or contingency
expenditures. Use the “Level Bypass” option and expend IAW paragraph 7.18.2.2.5.
          7.18.2.2.5. Processing WRM munitions expenditures: Munitions expended for a
          valid WRM, combat, or contingency purpose in Categories F, G, T, or X will be
          processed in CAS against the ORG/SHP codes identified in the WRM, Combat, or
          Contingency ORG/SHP Code Expenditure Processing table located at the AF/A4LW
          Information link on the GACP website. These ORG/SHP codes will be used
          regardless of original allocated ORG/SHP, quantity, or CAT Code.
NOTE: Prior to processing WRM, combat, or contingency expenditures against these ORG/SHP
codes, units must establish these ORG/SHP codes in CAS.
NOTE: It is not necessary to load levels for valid WRM, combat, or contingency expenditures.
Use the “Level Bypass” option when expending against these ORG/SHP codes.
NOTE: The GACP will update the support data edits table in CAS program Manage System
Edits (AMA10 ) for label name “LEVEL BYPASS ORG SHOP CODES”. The Manage System
Edits (AMA10) screen only allows additions or deletions. Any errors will require deletion and
reloading.
              7.18.2.2.5.1. Additions, deletions, or changes to the WRM, Combat, or
              Contingency ORG/SHP Code Expenditure Processing Table will be posted to the
              GACP website by AF/A4LW or GACP.
              7.18.2.2.5.2. This ORG/SHP structure for WRM, Combat, or Contingency
              expenditures for CAT Code F, G, T, and X enables automated extraction and
              reporting of expenditure data by 'Operation' from automated systems (e.g., CAS,
 156                            AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


              LIMS-EV, GCSS-AF Data Services, ECSS, etc).
          7.18.2.2.6. Aircraft Munitions Expenditure Process: As aircraft recover, weapons
          expeditors reconcile and document flightline munitions expenditures on an AF IMT
          2434 (or local form) IAW AFI 21-101 or AF IMT 4331, MTS. The weapons
          expeditor processes expenditures using automated-, direct-, and remote-input methods
          IAW paragraph 7.1.4.3. The AF IMT 2434 or AF IMT 4331, MTS will be turned in
          to the Munitions activity and used to validate daily processing of munitions
          transactions.
              7.18.2.2.6.1. Except as noted in paragraph 7.18.2.2.6.2, aircraft expenditures
              will be processed as aircraft recover throughout the flying day. As aircraft
              recover, reconcile and process expenditures in CAS within one hour of aircraft
              recovery, but no later than between aircraft goes.
              7.18.2.2.6.2. Do not process Aircraft gun ammunition and countermeasure
              expenditures using automated, direct, or remote input. Aircraft gun ammunition
              and countermeasures are downloaded and expended rounds are processed and
              validated by maintenance before processing expenditures in CAS.
              EXCEPTION: Weapons Expeditors supporting Special Operations Forces (SOF)
              and Search and Rescue (SAR) aircraft, may immediately process expenditures on
              the flightline if an entire container of ammunition is empty. Otherwise, manage a
              container as a full load until the gun is downloaded and remaining rounds are
              processed by maintenance.
                  7.18.2.2.6.2.1. Aircraft gun ammunition is managed as full loads (minus
                  ‘kickback’ rounds) until weapons personnel download the gun and expended
                  rounds are processed.
                  7.18.2.2.6.2.2. The AF IMT 4331, MTS or AF IMT 2434 will be verified by
                  Munitions Control and validated against the CAS daily transaction history by
                  the MASO. The AF IMT 4331, MTS or AF IMT 2434 may be destroyed after
                  validation.
       7.18.2.3. Expenditures of FMS, test, training, and for operations conducted by
       MOA/MOU (CAT Code N): Munitions allocated as CAT Code N MOA/MOU IAW
       paragraph 9.6.7.2 will be expended against non-WR ORG/SHP codes created for these
       specific purposes.
7.19. Turn-Ins. The user coordinates with the Munitions Flight to turn-in munitions. Turn-ins
as discussed in this chapter refer to returning assets to the DoDAAC stock account.
   7.19.1. There are five types of turn-ins:
       7.19.1.1. Organizational Turn-in (ORG TIN): Use the ORG TIN process for:
          7.19.1.1.1. Turn-in of assets when the origin is known. If the origin of assets is not
          known, use FOB Turn-in procedures in paragraph 7.19.1.5.
          7.19.1.1.2. Turn-in of components removed from an AUR when replacement
          components are not requisitioned.
          7.19.1.1.3. Turn-in of empty containers.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                              157


        7.19.1.1.4. Turn-in of static display munitions (SDM).
        7.19.1.1.5. Turn-in of recovered stock-listed assets previously adjusted off
        accountable record when a zero-balance exists. If a stock balance exists, refer to IAD
        Procedures in paragraph 7.12.
        7.19.1.1.6. Process ORG TIN using the CAS FOB Turn-In (AM555A) program.
            7.19.1.1.6.1. In the Comments block enter: ‘ORG TIN’ and a brief description
            (e.g., Component TIN, Container TIN, Static Display TIN, or Recovered Asset
            TIN).
            7.19.1.1.6.2. When ‘ORG TIN’ is annotated in the comments block, the
            mandatory documents outlined in paragraph 7.12, Inventory Adjustment
            Transaction (AM427J) procedures are not required unless it meets the
            requirements of paragraph 7.12.10.
        7.19.1.1.7. ORG TINs do not require a special inventory before processing an ORG
        TIN FOB transaction.
        7.19.1.1.8. For any recovered items that are non stock-listed, refer to procedures in
        paragraph 3.12.7.
     7.19.1.2. Custody Turn-in. Turn-in of assets from custody accounts.
     7.19.1.2. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) For custody assets maintained under the trainer
     maintenance contract, the custodian must initiate equipment deletion with the trainer
     maintenance contractor to ensure the assets are removed from the IMDS system. If
     discrepancies are discovered during the trainer maintenance equipment identification
     deletion procedures, the asset will still be turned in from the custody account. The
     IMDS AWM or AWP number will be maintained for the asset in storage.
     7.19.1.3. Expenditure Turn-in.
        7.19.1.3.1. This process will not be used to turn-in assets erroneously expended from
        a custody account. Units must process an RVP or inventory adjustment to correct
        errors.
        7.19.1.3.2. Utilize the ‘Expenditure Turn-in’ for assets originally consumption issued
        during the current FY, and was not consumed. Turn-in of assets originally
        consumption issued in a previous FY should be picked up using ORG TIN. If assets
        are classified ‘For Training Use Only’, items can be reissued to custody accounts to
        fill authorized training allocations.
        7.19.1.3.3. Upon turn-in of SmACC, Lot integrity will be assessed/maintained as
        follows:
            7.19.1.3.3.1. When SmACC is turned in by an individual who was originally
            issued the small arms ammunition along with the original AF IMT 4331, MTS
            issue document and all case markings match, then lot integrity is assumed. These
            assets may be inspected, turned-in using Expenditure Turn-in procedures IAW
            paragraph 7.19.1.3 and re-issued for custody/SmACC if otherwise serviceable.
            NOTE: Do not use cartridge case markings to establish the year of manufacture
 158                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


              of small arms ammunition, however the cartridge case markings may be used to
              validate general accuracy of AF IMT 4331, MTS lot number information for
              rounds returned by the individual they were originally issued to.
              7.19.1.3.3.2. Rounds received/recovered from amnesty programs/boxes or if the
              ammunition lot number of rounds returned by individuals cannot be validated,
              utilize FOB TIN procedures IAW paragraph 7.19.1.5 to pick-up assets in the
              appropriate CC. These rounds may be accumulated for inspection and TIN
              processing once TIN quantities exceed 100 rounds.
       7.19.1.4. Due-in From Maintenance (DIFM) Turn-in.
           7.19.1.4.1. Turn-in of assets originally issued under DIFM control. Use ORG TIN
           procedures for turn-in of assets that were issued in a previous FY and no replacement
           item is required.
           7.19.1.4.2. When an asset turned in from maintenance under a DIFM document
           number is not the same NSN as the issued asset, process the DIFM Turn-in using the
           NSN issued to clear the outstanding DIFM detail and then process a Selective Identity
           Change to correct the NSN to that of the turned in item.
           7.19.1.4.3. DIFM turn-in will be utilized during Missile and PGM Management IAW
           paragraph 3.10.4 when replacement components will be requisitioned.
       7.19.1.5. Found on Base (FOB) Turn-in.
           7.19.1.5.1. FOB turn-ins only include DoD stock-listed munitions where the origin of
           assets cannot be determined.
           7.19.1.5.2. For recovered items that are non stock-listed, refer to procedures in
           paragraph 3.12.7.
           7.19.1.5.3. The MASO reviews all FOB transactions to determine the need for a
           special inventory before processing the document. The MASO signs the document to
           indicate a review of special inventory requirements. These assets will be processed
           using the CAS FOB turn-in.
   7.19.2. Processing Turn-in Requests. All turn-in requests will include the following:
NOTE: Personnel authorized to receipt munitions being turned in from munitions users are
designated ‘in-checkers’ and perform in-check of turned in assets. In-check of turned-in assets
consists of comparing turn-in documents to physical assets, outer container markings (identity &
quantity), proper packaging, and safety.
       7.19.2.1. Nomenclature.
       7.19.2.2. NSN.
       7.19.2.3. Quantity
       7.19.2.4. Lot Number.
       7.19.2.5. CAT Code (if applicable).
       7.19.2.6. CC (If known).
       7.19.2.7. Document number of the original issue (if applicable).
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   159


      7.19.2.8. Reason for turn-in.
      7.19.2.9. In-checker signature, printed name, and date.
7.20. Deployed Munitions Management.
   7.20.1. Accountability and allocations of deployed non-expendable training munitions (e.g.,
   captive missiles, argon bottles, AMAs) may be transferred to the deployed DoDAAC or may
   be retained on the home station DoDAAC. Use the following guidelines to manage deployed
   non-expendable munitions:
      7.20.1.1. Follow the deployed location’s MAJCOM, theater, and installation/base
      guidance or procedures written in command/base supplements, deployment orders, or
      other reporting instructions that specify management and control of munitions assets at
      deployed locations.
          7.20.1.1.1. If MAJCOM, theater, and installation/base guidance is not available, the
          deployed location MASO and home station MASO shall agree on the best method to
          support the mission. Consider deployment duration, type of assets, availability of in-
          place assets, and level of effort.
          7.20.1.1.2. Whether managed from home station or deployed location,
          communication between the deployed location MASO and home station MASO is
          essential. The MASO shall validate deployment requirements, and ensure physical
          management, security, safety, and accountability of munitions upon arrival and
          throughout the deployment.
          7.20.1.1.3. Only deploy essential non-expendable training munitions. Prior to
          deployment, home station munitions supervision shall coordinate with deployed
          location munitions supervision to validate availability of in-place training munitions
          for home station use.
          7.20.1.1.4. When deploying non-expendable training munitions to an established
          DoDAAC, the following procedures will be used:
             7.20.1.1.4.1. If accountability of non-expendable munitions assets are transferred
             or if assets are tactical ferried and transferred using the ‘Import‘ option in the CAS
             Expeditor Management (AM2W1A) program, the home station MASO will
             ensure an ATR is submitted IAW paragraph 7.5.3.3.
             7.20.1.1.4.2. Maintenance records and documentation for deployed CATM assets
             (i.e., TMRS) may be maintained and managed at the home station or at the
             deployed location at the discretion and agreement of munitions supervision at the
             deployed location and home station. If the CAS ‘import’ option is used then the
             assets and allocations will be managed at the deployed location.
             7.20.1.1.4.3. When managed at the deployed location, home station munitions
             supervision will ensure TMRS records are electronically transferred to the
             deployed location. Munitions supervision at the deployed location will ensure
             records are maintained (e.g., TMRS) during the deployment and electronically
             transferred back to the home station upon redeployment.
             7.20.1.1.4.4. If managed at home station, munitions supervision at the deployed
 160                            AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


              location will ensure any inspection or maintenance actions are promptly reported
              to the home station via e-mail.
              7.20.1.1.4.5. The deployed unit is responsible to ensure all non-expendable
              training munitions return to home station upon redeployment.
              7.20.1.1.4.6. If non-expendable training munitions are deployed to a location
              where no established DoDAAC exists, manage assets from home station until a
              DoDAAC is established or the deployed location’s MAJCOM or theater provide
              specific instructions.
       7.20.1.2. Expendable Aircraft Munitions: When a unit moves munitions via tactical
       ferry to a deployed location with an established DoDAAC, each deployed location will
       transfer assets using the ‘Import’ option in the CAS Expeditor Management (AM2W1A)
       program. This process transfers the assets loaded on the specific aircraft from home
       station to the gaining DoDAAC as stock assets. WSN records are also transferred
       retaining the original WSN.
NOTE: Bulk assets will still be transferred utilizing the shipping/receiving method.
           7.20.1.2.1. If the assets were assigned to a custody account the assets must be
           returned to stock then transferred to the gaining location as stock assets.
           7.20.1.2.2. Expenditures during In-transit: The MASO at the receiving location
           (gaining MASO) will ensure that a validation is conducted to verify quantity of assets
           received and expended. Expend the appropriate quantity against the ORG/SHP code
           as identified in paragraph 7.6.3.2.
           7.20.1.2.3. MAF Staged/Deployed WRM Countermeasures: Tactical Control
           (TACON) and non-TACON.
              7.20.1.2.3.1. Accountability for C-5/C-17 WRM countermeasures remain with
              the home station MASO until resupply is required when these aircraft are staged
              at OCONUS locations.
              7.20.1.2.3.2. Countermeasures loaded on staged C-5/C-17 aircraft that require
              resupply will be imported at the time of download IAW paragraph 7.20.1.2. A
              CAS ADHOC report will be ran using the ‘Containers Table’ to identify both the
              owning DoDAAC and current CAS maintaining DoDAAC. The receiving
              location will coordinate with the losing location to obtain service life data.
              7.20.1.2.3.3. The aircraft container and associated munitions will only be
              imported by another DoDAAC when resupply is needed or when the staged
              aircraft returns to home station. Every effort will be made to ensure the Chaff-
              Flare Magazine Container is loaded on one of the owning DoDAAC tails to
              ensure SPRAM accountability.
              7.20.1.2.3.4. Accountability for C-130 WRM countermeasures will be managed
              at the deployed location MASO when aircraft are deployed to OCONUS
              locations. The deployed DoDAAC will import WRM countermeasures IAW
              paragraph 7.20.1.2. The deployed location will coordinate with the originating
              location to obtain service life data. The following is not authorized:
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                               161


               7.20.1.2.3.4.1. Cross-loading   of   countermeasures    from    deploying    or
               redeploying aircraft.
               7.20.1.2.3.4.2. Holding countermeasures from a deployed aircraft for loading
               during redeployment.
     7.20.1.3. Custody Accounts:        If custodians require shipment of assets via the
     transportation activity to an established DoDAAC, assets will be turned in to the MSA
     and appropriate shipment documents processed. Shipment documents must be forwarded
     to the gaining MASO.
        7.20.1.3.1. If shipment is to a location with no established DoDAAC, contact NAF or
        Lead MAJCOM munitions staff, which will coordinate with the NAF or Lead
        MAJCOM with operational oversight of the deployment location to establish a
        DoDAAC IAW paragraph 9.2 or designate an existing DoDAAC to provide MASO
        oversight.
        7.20.1.3.2. Instead of shipment, the MASO may request MAJCOM/NAF A4W (or
        equivalent) approval to retain deployed assets on custodial account. OSI, Para
        Rescue, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) or other missions that support frequent
        operations/training missions shorter than 30 calendar days may maintain assets on
        home station Custody Account.
        7.20.1.3.3. If custodians ship munitions using mobility channels, the MASO must
        turn-in and ship assets. Shipment documents will be forwarded to the gaining MASO
        at the DoDAAC designated by the NAF or Lead MAJCOM with operational
        oversight.
        7.20.1.3.4. The Installation Deployment Officer (IDO) or deployed commander will
        designate a responsible individual to be the munitions courier. The individual will be
        responsible for maintaining accountability of assets until they are turned in to the
        home-station or deployed MASO.
        7.20.1.3.5. Munitions requested in support of contingency tasking without a custody
        account should be the exception and not the standard operating procedure. In this
        case, deploying members must furnish a copy of their orders or other official
        communication (i.e., official e-mail or memorandum signed by IDO) stating member
        must deploy with ammunition.
        7.20.1.3.6. If personnel must hand-carry weapons and munitions, the following
        procedures must be used:
            7.20.1.3.6.1. The MASO must process turn-in (if required)/shipment (PTO) to
            applicable DoDAAC, if known. A copy of the shipment document will be
            forwarded to the gaining MASO at the DoDAAC designated by MAJCOM/NAF
            with operational oversight. The MAJCOM/NAF will establish a DoDAAC IAW
            paragraph 9.2 or designate an existing DoDAAC to provide MASO oversight.
               7.20.1.3.6.1.1. Provide a copy of the shipment document to deploying
               individual.
               7.20.1.3.6.1.2. The following statement will be on the back of the shipment
               document and briefed to the member: “Small arms ammunition will be
 162                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


                 controlled and the person receiving the munitions must maintain
                 accountability and lot number integrity for these assets. The shipping
                 document and munitions will be turned in to the Air Force munitions storage
                 area at the deployed location. If a storage area has not been established,
                 member will retain accountability for these assets. Member will document on
                 the back of the shipment document if assets are expended or turned over to
                 any other military storage area (Army, Navy, etc.). If turned over to a military
                 authority, member will receive documentation showing who accepted
                 accountability for the assets to include: Name, rank, organization, and home
                 base DSN (Do not use SSN). This documentation will be given to the home
                 station MASO upon return from deployment.”
          7.20.1.3.7. Once munitions have been shipped units must contact the NAF or Lead
          MAJCOM for replacement procedures.
7.21. WRM Mobility, CAT Code B, Allocation and Account Management: The MASO
manages WRM Mobility, CAT Code B munitions allocations and accounts as follows:
   7.21.1. CAT Code B munitions requirements will be validated by the functional areas they
   support and coordinated through and verified by the base/wing Installation Deployment
   Officer (IDO).
   7.21.2. Forecast for miscellaneous mobility munitions covered in AFCAT 21-209, Volume
   1, Ground Munitions using the Ground Munitions Allocation Tables (GMAT) for Ground
   Munitions located on the GACP website. Forecast these ground munitions under a single
   wing mobility account, ORG/SHP 002BP and Functional User Code L4. ORG/SHP account
   002BP is a forecasting and allocation management account only; do not expend assets
   against ORG/SHP 002BP.
NOTE: MAJCOMs may provide additional guidance for units managing multiple command
code mobility requirements from a single DoDAAC. However these assets will not be expended
from the DoDAAC stock account or ORG/SHP 002BP.
   7.21.3. Do not issue CAT Code B WRM ammunition until required for deployment unless
   specifically authorized in this AFI. Otherwise, manage CAT Code B munitions as base
   stock. This increases logistics flexibility to issue WRM ammunition when needed to support
   various levels of effort, and reduces inventories and administrative tasks for accounts with
   little or no activity.
   7.21.4. When CAT Code B allocated mobility munitions are in base stock they will not be
   physically segregated and will be inventoried as base stock. Units may add a ‘WRM’
   location identifier at the end of the CAS location to enhance management.
   7.21.5. When required for deployment, these assets will be shipped from stock to deployed
   locations for subsequent issue or issued to appropriate custody accounts prior to deployment.
   In either case, these assets will be issued, deployed, and expended from custody account
   IAW paragraphs 7.18 and 7.20 IAW paragraph 14.2.4.2, the MASO may submit ATRs to
   allocate the next higher QUP for mobility accounts. If the ATR is approved, units may ship
   CAT-B mobility assets to the nearest QUP. EXAMPLE: A unit authorized 90 rds of 9mm
   per AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1 and the GMAT table on the GACP website, is allocated 27
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                               163


   rds of 9mm (90 rds x .30 = 27 rds). An ATR increases the allocation to 30 rds allowing
   tasked personnel to travel with 2 full clips (2 clips x 15 rds = 30 rds).
   7.21.6. If a functional area/organization requests issue of CAT Code B allocated munitions
   before receipt of execution/mobilization order, they must provide justification to the MASO
   and IDO who will decide if the operational urgency and deployment frequency justify the
   management effort involved. The IDO makes the final decision on when to issue CAT Code
   B mobility munitions and the quantities to be issued to each account based on the total wing
   allocation. Issuing CAT Code B ammunition to custody accounts should only be considered
   when:
      7.21.6.1. Mission circumstances dictate immediate access and control over munitions
      and issue/ shipment procedures cannot support required timelines.
      7.21.6.2. The unit/agency requires frequent deployment of munitions to locations
      without an established DoDAAC.
   7.21.7. Limit custody accounts to one per separate residual force (i.e., PRIME BEEF,
   security forces, EOD, OSI, etc.).
   7.21.8. Except as authorized in paragraph 7.21.5 and 7.21.6, do not issue/release assets
   prior to receipt of execution or mobilization order or prior to coordination with the IDO
   office.
   7.21.9. Ensure proper security and transfer documentation for these assets IAW paragraph
   7.20.1.3 whether real-world or exercise.
   7.21.10. Prior to releasing any CAT Code B assets to unit for shipment, coordinate with
   gaining MASO, or MAJCOM/NAF to ensure the assets are not available at the deployed
   location.
   EXCEPTION: During local exercises, physical assets may be broken out, staged, and
   processed for deployment as “bulk-shipped” assets. The shipping document will be
   generated using the CAS training database to demonstrate the capability to generate the
   shipping paperwork.
   7.21.11. Do not requisition replacements for assets deployed from home station.
   Requisitions may be submitted after expenditures are validated and processed or shipments
   are processed removing assets from the DoDAAC stock account.
7.22. Time-Change Item (TCI) Cartridge Actuated Device/Propellant Actuated Device
(CAD/PAD) Management.
   7.22.1. TCI Forecasting. Forecasting of CAD/PAD items shall be accomplished IAW AFI
   21-101. End users of CAD/PAD items must forecast for items not visible in the ALC
   IMDS/REMIS/G081 by using the AFTO Form 223, Time Change Requirements Forecast,
   (automated or manual) IAW T.O. 00-20-9, Forecasting Replacement Requirements for
   Selected Calendar and Hourly Time Change Items. Units supporting KC-10 aircraft must
   also forecast for ARD 863 Carts (Refer to the annual PCAR memorandum for guidance on
   ARD cart forecasting).
   7.22.2. TCI Requisitioning.
 164                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


       7.22.2.1. Munitions organizations will meet quarterly with Maintenance Operations
       Flight (MOF) P&S, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) (formerly Survival Equipment and
       Life Support), and the Flight Service Center (FSC) to determine maintenance
       requirements for the next nine month period by Mission Design Series (MDS), by tail
       number, and/or Next Higher Assembly (NHA) by SN.
          7.22.2.1.1. During the quarterly Munitions, P&S, and FSC meeting, TCI
          requirements for aircraft scheduled for depot maintenance shall be identified to
          include requirements for items that will be changed out at field-level and those that
          will be shipped from the field to support TCI requirements during depot maintenance.
          P&S will identify those items that will be requisitioned by the depot maintenance
          activity.
          7.22.2.1.1. (SHEPPARDAFBSUP) Requirements for next quarter will be turned in
          3 duty days prior to due date stated in AFI 21-201, Table 7.5. 9.11.1.1.1. A courtesy

          7.22.2.1.2. When the depot maintenance activity requisitions time change
          replacement parts for aircraft in or during depot maintenance, field activities will not
          requisition these parts.
       7.22.2.2. To facilitate quarterly requisitioning, P&S will submit the quarterly validated
       time-change AFTO Form 223, Spreadsheet, or IMDS/G081 generated forecast to the
       MASO between 45 and 60 calendar days (CONUS) or between 90 and 120 calendar days
       (OCONUS) before the next calendar year quarter IAW Table 7.5.
       7.22.2.3. Requirements validated at quarterly meetings will be consolidated by the
       MASO for the wing and requisitions submitted to allow assets to be available in time for
       scheduled maintenance. Units forecast for items listed in T.O. 00-20-9, Table 4.1.
       7.22.2.4. The MASO submits quarterly consolidated requisitions, based on the quarterly
       maintenance meeting through CAS allowing time for surface movement action. In
       remarks of CAS requisition list applicable tail numbers.
          7.22.2.4.1. The quarterly consolidated requisition determines the authorized stock
          level to be loaded in CAS.
          7.22.2.4.2. Provide supplemental shipping address when applicable.
          7.22.2.4.3. When deployed aircraft will be due time change maintenance during a
          deployed period, notify the gaining MAJCOM/NAF and MASO of the requisition and
          applicable tail numbers.
   7.22.3. Stocking and Issuing TCI. The quarterly Munitions and P&S meeting will serve as
   MASO authority to schedule and issue assets to the unit maintenance activity. Assets
   ordered beyond those scheduled during the quarterly meeting will require coordination
   between the MASO and P&S.
       7.22.3.1. Limit on-hand CAD/PAD stock balances to one per MDS supported in case of
       inadvertent firings or maintenance defects. Justify additional asset balances through the
       IM by SAAR.
EXCEPTION: If an item has an AFTO Form 223 for scheduled maintenance, a SAAR is not
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                 165


required to justify the consumption issue.
EXCEPTION: Activities supporting RDT&E, to include CAD/PAD aging and surveillance
program activities, are not limited the above CAD/PAD stock balances. HQ AFMC shall
develop and coordinate guidance for AFMC RDT&E agencies. This guidance applies to all
agencies supporting AFMC RDT&E activity regardless of host unit MAJCOM.
       7.22.3.2. For ICBM and Launch Facility ordnance replacement parts load unit levels
       IAW 748 SCMS/GUMA allocation levels maintained on the GACP website.
       7.22.3.3. MASOs are authorized to issue assets one calendar quarter ahead of their
       forecasted quarter without IM approval. For issue requests falling outside one calendar
       quarter ahead, the using organization will coordinate the request with the IM. This will
       be documented and provided to the MASO as justification to issue assets ahead of
       schedule.
       7.22.3.4. Bases that support transient strategic airlift (airlift hubs) such as C-5, C-17,
       KC-10, or KC-135 type aircraft, are authorized to keep one complete aircraft system load
       of TCI on hand for each MDS common to that base. These assets are not for use in
       home-station assigned aircraft, but transient aircraft needing time change parts due to
       inadvertent firing or unforeseen maintenance requirements incurred while away from
       home station. Submit a SAAR for these authorized parts.
           7.22.3.4.1. When assets are on-hand to support transient aircraft, consumption issue
           time change items to an existing account IAW DIFM procedures in paragraph
           7.16.1.1.
           7.22.3.4.2. When assets are not on-hand, request lateral support through the GACP.

7.23. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Time Change Procedures.
   7.23.1. AFE munitions are explosive items issued for installation into aircrew survival vests,
   parachutes, survival kits, and life rafts.
       7.23.1.1. AFE munitions with an MSRC are forecasted IAW paragraph 14.2 of this
       instruction. OOCR procedures apply to these types of assets.
       7.23.1.2. AFE munitions without an MSRC are forecasted in the same manner as Time-
       Change munitions IAW paragraph 7.22.2. These items will be identified during the
       quarterly Munitions, P&S, and FSC meeting.
   7.23.2. AFE Replacement Munitions (Time Change). Use CAT Code A to forecast
   munitions required to replace assets which are reaching their time change interval (end of
   service life) and for expected or known failure rates. AFE munitions issued under CAT Code
   A require consumption issue using DIFM control and an approved CAT Code A allocation to
   support time change or unserviceable replacements.

   7.23.3. AFE Munitions Initial Build-up. Use CAT Code T to forecast requirements for
   initial build-up of AFE munitions which supports existing or new aircraft/aircrews. All
   issues under this CAT Code require consumption type initial issue using NON-DIFM control
   and an approved CAT Code T allocation to support the buildup of new AFE munitions. CC-
   A and CC-C assets, with sufficient time remaining, will be used to fill requirements in this
   CAT Code.
   7.23.4. AFE Munitions Training Requirements. Use CAT Code D to forecast aircrew
   pyrotechnic signaling devices required to support aircrew training. All munitions in this
   CAT Code are issued to a custody account and require an approved CAT Code D allocation.
   Items in this CAT Code will not be consumption issued or use DIFM controls and will be
   filled with CC-B or CC-C items before using CC-A assets.
   7.23.5. Tracking Installed AFE Munitions. AFE units are responsible for tracking assets by
   item, lot number and prescribed shelf/service life in the Automated Life Support
   Management System (ALSMS) or Automated Life-sustaining Equipment Record and
   Tracking System (ALERTS) according to AFI 11-301. AFE units follow paragraph 7.26,
   CMRS Procedures.
   7.23.6. AFE Munitions Aircraft Transfer Procedures: Losing units will initiate action to
   transfer assets/allocations to the gaining custody account. Gaining custody account custodian
   will ensure transferred (incoming) munitions are processed through the MASO using
   procedures above.
7.24. Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) Munitions Management. COTS munitions will not
be purchased or used prior to final written GACP COTS Munitions Program Manager (CMPM)
approval to ensure the safety and health of Air Force personnel and maintain accountability of
dangerous items while supporting operational requirements.
NOTE: Air Force approved locally procured COTS will be managed on CAS Accountable
records. Do not use the Non-accountable Program (AM101A).

   Units will immediately discontinue use and submit a data package for approval
   consideration.
EXCEPTION: HQ AFMC shall develop and coordinate COTS guidance for AFMC RDT&E
agencies. HQ AFMC guidance applies to all agencies that support AFMC RDT&E activity
regardless of host unit MAJCOM.
   7.24.2. COTS munitions purchases are to meet unique, non-recurring, short-term (less than
   one year) requirements or for immediately needed stock-listed items that are currently not
   available for requisition through normal AF distribution channels. Approved COTS
   munitions maintained longer than one year from approval date, require annual revalidation.
   7.24.3. Units will identify long-term requirements through the NAF or Lead MAJCOM
   functional staff to the Air Staff functional (using) agency to facilitate development of formal
   operational requirements for procurement, sustainment strategies, cataloging and
   management.
   7.24.4. Munitions required for long-term needs or commitments must be identified by the
   MUFM to the applicable Air Staff functional user agency. The Air Staff functional user
   agency must develop and submit a Capability Production Document (CPD) to the appropriate
   ALC for procurement, sustainment strategies, cataloging and management.
   7.24.5. Authorized and approved COTS munitions are disposed of IAW paragraph 3.12.8.
   7.24.6. To purchase COTS explosives and munitions, the requesting unit will coordinate a
   package through the MASO, Environmental, Weapons Safety, EOD, Transportation, and
   Legal agencies for Group and Installation Commander approval IAW paragraph 7.24.8..

       (JHCS)/Munitions History Program (MHP) or listed in the COTS database via the GACP
       website require approval IAW paragraph 7.24.8.3. The database contains active,
       archived and disapproved COTS. Units will contact AFSFC/SFXW to inform of
       purchase intent of ground munitions.
NOTE: Users must register on the MHP site for continued access to the JHCS applications. Users
can register at the following URL: https://mhp.redstone.army.mil
       7.24.7.2. Units    will    inform       the       GACP        CMPM         by      e-mail:
       (ooalc.cotsmunitions@hill.af.mil) of their intention to purchase COTS.
       7.24.7.3. Prior to routing any COTS data package through Installation channels it must
       first be coordinated by the MASO. The MASO will coordinate on the package for further
       coordination if the item is not AF stocklisted and no suitable like item is AF stocklisted.
       7.24.7.4. Archived COTS which have an expired Interim Hazard Classification (IHC)
       will need Installation and ALC level approval before items are acquired.

172                            AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


  Laboratory Developed Explosive (LDE) test samples. HQ AFMC/A4M will develop and
  coordinate procedures supporting 96th Test Group test operations with the host unit
  Maintenance Group commander (or equivalent) and the host MAJCOM munitions staff.
      7.25.1.1. When a SPO and/or Responsible Test Officer (RTO) acquires RDT&E
      munitions assets outside of the normal munitions procurement, requisitioning, and
      allocation process/channels through program baseline funding or any other means, they
      become the owner of the RDT&E munitions assets.
         7.25.1.1.1. The owning SPO and/or RTO must coordinate with the owning
         MAJCOM munitions staff and local MASO, prior to shipping SPO/RTO owned
         assets to the munitions unit. This coordination is required to ensure proper munitions
         management and effective munitions support.
         7.25.1.1.2. When properly coordinated, munitions received by the munitions unit in
         support of RDT&E will be picked up on the DoDAAC stock account in CAS within 5
         duty days after receipt. The MASO will immediately contact MAJCOM if assets are
         received without prior coordination.
         7.25.1.1.3. Control and management of SPO/RTO program owned munitions assets
         rest exclusively with these officials. Therefore, the SPO/PTO will ensure the MASO
         is provided with current and accurate program ownership support documentation in
         the form of contract purchase order, Government Purchase Card (GPC) purchase
         order, or MIPR. This documentation is critical to ensure appropriate ownership and
         responsibility of these items is not lost. The MASO will maintain this documentation
         for management and audit purposes.
         7.25.1.1.4. When a SPO, RTO, test program managers (TPM), or PM purchase stock
         listed or non-stock listed munitions assets to support tests, they become responsible to
         act as the IM and MUFM for these assets.
         7.25.1.1.5. During procurement of R&D assets, the SPO/RTO will request technical
         data, MSDS, IHC, chemical constituency data and disposal data for these assets. The
         SPO/RTO must provide this information and related data to the TPM/PM and the
         MASO at the receiving and storing activity prior to shipping the assets.
      7.25.1.2. The MASO must load levels for RDT&E assets in CAS. The SPO and/or RTO
      authorize loading or adjusting RDT&E levels in CAS by providing the MASO with
      copies of documents that validate test requirements by program (e.g., clearly marked for
      the program). These levels will be validated in conjunction with the MASO semi-annual
      account review for assets maintained on stockpile and during the MASO annual Custody
      inventory for assets Custody issued. Applicable test directive, test program plan, contract
      purchase order, Government Purchase Card (GPC) purchase order, Military
      Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR), or active AFMC Job Order Number (JON)
      will be maintained by the MASO for audit purposes.
         7.25.1.2.1. All SPO/RTO owned munitions assets assigned local stock numbers in
         CAS must include an appropriately assigned CIIC. Installation Resource Protection
         Managers may be able to help if the appropriate CIIC is not readily determined.

         7.25.1.2.3. Upon completion of an R&D test project, AF owned assets remaining on
         the test accounts will be turned-in to the MSA DoDAAC stock account. The test PM
         or program office is responsible for coordinating with the appropriate SPO/RTO to
         determine if the assets are no longer required or cannot be utilized for future test
         projects.
             7.25.1.2.3.1. DELETED.
             7.25.1.2.3.2. If test assets are required at another installation, the test PM or
             program office will coordinate with the SPO/RTO to provide the MASO with
             movement guidance/instructions. Assets purchased by specific programs outside
             of normal allocation process must include a funding line to pay for transportation
             as program owned assets are not covered under SDT requirements.
             7.25.1.2.3.3. If these test assets are serviceable and the SPO/RTO no longer
             requires the assets for test purposes, the MASO will report them as serviceable
             excess via the automated serviceable excess program on the GACP website IAW
             paragraph 3.12.5.2.
             7.25.1.2.3.4. If test assets are unserviceable for general operational/training use
             IAW technical data, the SPO/RTO no longer requires the assets for test purposes,
             and the assets are stock listed, the MASO will submit an ADR IAW paragraph
             3.12.6.2. For test assets purchased outside of the normal allocation process, the
             SPO/RTO must provide the MASO a funding line to pay for Demilitarization or
             transportation. Program owned assets are not covered under SDT requirements.
             7.25.1.2.3.5. Contractors are responsible to dispose of contractor owned R&D
             assets. The program office is responsible to ensure a funding line is provided to
             cover disposal costs related to contractor R&D activity.
         7.25.1.2.4. If an unsafe situation develops with test munitions, base commanders (or
         equivalent), in coordination with EOD, may approve the destruction of a munitions or
         explosive item that constitutes an immediate danger to human life or property IAW
         Level 1 disposition procedures of paragraph 3.12. The appropriate test PM shall
         notify the program office of the emergency disposition of assets not allocated through
         the normal allocation process or emergency disposition of contractor owned assets
         within 48 hours after disposition.
  7.25.2. Forecasting for Test/Contract Munitions. Test munitions for which there is a suitable
  AF stock listed asset available must be forecasted/allocated annually.
     7.25.2.1. OOCR for tests will be submitted to the MASO for review. If the MASO
     cannot provide an allocation for the OOCR, the MASO must then forward the request to
     the MAJCOM MUFM for review and resolution.
     7.25.2.2. If the MUFM cannot provide an allocation, the MUFM will then forward the
     request to the Air Staff functional office for resolution.
     7.25.2.3. Test organizations must forecast for all serviceable CAS-managed
     components/munitions (fins, impulse cartridges, etc.) needed to support test project
     requirements involving other munitions. Preliminary or interim T.O. guidance must be
     provided IAW T.O. 00-5-3 and AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle

       Management. Nonstandard munitions received without sufficient documentation (e.g.
       technical data) constitutes a potential safety hazard to both facilities and personnel. If
       received without required documentation, the receiving unit will impound those
       munitions and place them in CC-J (suspended from issued, true condition unknown) until
       required documentation is received.
       7.25.2.4. All stock-listed and non stock-listed munitions and components required in
       conjunction with an item that can be forecasted must be supplied by the SPO/RTO.

                    MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES

 8.1. Introduction: Lead MAJCOM designations outlined in AFPD 10-9, Lead Command
 Designation and Responsibilities For Weapon Systems primarily apply to Weapons Systems
 Management and Sustainment activities. For the purposes of Conventional Munitions
 Maintenance Management, Lead MAJCOM designations are aligned differently to appropriately
 reflect essential and necessary HQ Munitions Management and CMA functions, roles, and
 relationships. The following reachback relations will be used:
    8.1.1. For long-term munitions system management and sustainment issues, wings/groups
    work directly with Lead MAJCOMs and CMAs, and share information with the MAJCOM
    and/or NAF.
    8.1.2. Munitions contingency planning and execution occurs through the MAJCOM and/or
    NAF with reachback to the Lead MAJCOM and the GACP. Day-to-day munitions
    management and technical issues will be addressed to the Lead MAJCOM and the GACP,
    and share information with the MAJCOM/NAF.
    8.1.3. Lead MAJCOMs and the GACP provide staff support covering duty hours of both
    Lead and Supported MAJCOMs/NAFs.
    8.1.4. Lead MAJCOMs and the GACP coordinate technical support and provide guidance on
    issues beyond unit capabilities through the T.O. waiver process, technical data assistance
    requests and through reachback to supported agencies.

                    CONVENTIONAL MUNITIONS MANAGEMENT

9.1. Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DoDAAC).
   9.1.1. HQ AFMC/A4MW is the focal point for munitions DoDAACs. A DoDAAC as used
   in this instruction refers to active or contingency munitions accounts.
   9.1.2. An installation may maintain more than one conventional munitions account when
   separate storage areas/facilities exist on the same installation (i.e., War Reserve Stock for
   Allies). Requests for additional DoDAACs will clearly indicate why it is in the best interest
   of the Air Force.
   9.1.3. Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve (AFRC) organizations may
   establish a DoDAAC at any installation where the ANG or AFRC maintains an active
   munitions operation.
   9.1.4. Establishing a DoDAAC.         Lead MAJCOMs, ARC, and NAFs will request
   establishment, change, or deletion of a DoDAAC IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part 2,
   Chapter 1, Air Force DoDAACs, SRANs, And Station Numbers.
       9.1.4.1. Submit requests on-line through the DoDAAC Web Management System at:
       https://dodaac.wpafb.af.mil. Select ‘Request DoDAAC’, ‘Change DoDAAC’, or
       ‘Delete DoDAAC’ as applicable.
       9.1.4.2. Maintain accuracy of DoDAAC information by updating CAS or other
       applicable systems and coordinating changes with the DoDAAC monitor identified at:
       https://dodaac.wpafb.af.mil. After DoDAAC has been established/changed/deleted,
       submit addition/change/deletion information to the CAS PMO.
       9.1.4.3. If a location is controlled or classified, classify the request appropriately.
       Controlled addresses are published with ‘controlled’ as the clear text address. The Lead
       MAJCOM, ARC, and NAFs will maintain a classified list of their controlled DoDAACs
       and provide this listing to AF/A4LW, AF/A5R-C, and the GACP whenever updates are
       accomplished.
9.2. Combat Ammunition System (CAS) Administration. CAS is an unclassified system
IAW DoDI 8510.01, DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process
(DIACAP). Roles are assigned to every individual with access to CAS IAW Table 9.1, CAS
Roles.
   9.2.1. System Administration (SA) Levels. There are four levels of CAS SA. These levels
   are: CAS PMO (Functional SA), GACP SA, MAJCOM SA, and the Local (base) SA.
   Depending upon their level of authorization, the SA has the capability to add, change, or
   delete a CAS user from the system. The SA also has the ability to assign permissions to each
   user that specifies which programs and or functional areas may be accessed. In order for the
   menu to be created dynamically upon user login, the SA must assign permissions using the
   CAS User Management (AMA01A) program to designate specific programs for individual
   user access. A description of the SA responsibilities is listed below.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                201


     9.2.1.1. The CAS PMO is able to assign CAS_USER roles to all levels of CAS
     personnel. The assignment of the admin role will be accomplished using a tiered method
     where the CAS PMO will have overall authority. The CAS PMO will be responsible for
     assigning the CAS_ADMIN-MAJCOM privilege to Lead MAJCOM SAs, who will in-
     turn be responsible for assigning the CAS_ADMIN-BASE privilege to the local
     administrators at the bases within the Lead Command domain. When the SA is assigned
     the CAS_ADMIN role they have the ability to assign the CAS_USER role to anyone at
     their level and below.
     9.2.1.2. CAS Functional System Administrator (FSA) Level. These individuals are
     assigned to the CAS PMO and are responsible for the administration of the CAS
     application database. These FSAs will act as the intermediaries for the Defense
     Information Systems Agency and the CAS functional users. If a problem arises where a
     database recovery would be required, the FSA will inform DISA of the need for recovery
     of the database. CAS FSA Administration capabilities in the application software are
     user management and utilities. The capabilities provided at this level are as follows:
        9.2.1.2.1. Add SPO SA – Ability to assign the FSA privileges to an individual.

     equivalent) will appoint a primary and alternate Lead MAJCOM CAS administrator in
     writing. A copy of the appointment memorandum will be provided to the CAS PMO. The
     appointment memorandum will be validated annually. When the primary or alternate
     administrator is relieved of his/her duties, a new appointment memorandum must be
     accomplished identifying the successor and will reference the superseded memorandum.
         9.2.2.1. Upon receipt and validation of the appointment memorandum the CAS PMO
         will assign the CAS Admin-MAJCOM role to the Lead MAJCOM SA identified in the
         memorandum. Once the Admin-MAJCOM role is assigned to the Lead MAJCOM SA
         and appears in the SA's Air Force Portal, he or she will then be able to access the AF
         portal link. This will not grant access to the CAS application. The Lead MAJCOM SA
         will then have to be loaded to the CAS application using the Admin menu, user
         management option in the application software to be able to access the application
         software.
         9.2.2.2. The Lead MAJCOM SA will be the point of contact (POC) for all matters
         relating to the CAS application. The primary or alternate administrator is granted unique
         roles; therefore, as a minimum, one of the appointed administrators must be available to
         support daily CAS operations. In the event a unit is unable to successfully contact their
         MAJCOM representative the SPO SA at Gunter AFB may be contacted for assistance in
         granting privileges needed at the base level unit.

         9.2.2.3. Lead MAJCOM System Administration. The Lead MAJCOM SA is responsible
         for the users assigned to the bases they support. They provide administrative privilege to
         trusted users in order to perform system administrative functions at their locations. By
         granting access, the SA’s are entrusting the security of the system to individuals assigned.
         The MAJCOM SA can load CAS roles to MAJCOM users and base users within their
         command in the application software. The Local Base System Administrators will be
         appointed in writing and a copy of the appointment memorandum will be provided to the
         MAJCOM SA (see paragraphs 2.6.9 and 7.2.5.2).
             9.2.2.3.1. Once the MAJCOM SA has validated the appointment memorandum, the
             MAJCOM SA assigns the CAS Admin-Base role to the local Base SAs within their
             command. The user will still need to be granted access to the application software
             using Administration menu, user management.
             9.2.2.3.2. The MAJCOM SA is granted privileges to add, change, or delete
             MAJCOM or base level users and administrators within their commands. The
             MAJCOM SA will grant the primary and alternate base level administrator their roles
             in the CAS application, once their GCSS-AF IF logins are assigned.
  9.3. Munitions Reports.
     9.3.1. CAS is the Air Force’s munitions accounting and reporting system and the source for
     reporting munitions asset data.

       9.4.2.3. The Air Force Civil Engineering Agency (AFCEA/CEXD) for explosive
       demolition materials.
   9.4.3. The FSC and stock number of an item do not in themselves determine the system of
   supply management (i.e., CAS or SBSS) or whether an item is a munitions asset. End item
   usage, hazard characteristics, maintenance characteristics, security/sensitivity, supply chain,
   and source of supply are the primary considerations.
   9.4.4. Annually, 30 calendar days prior to the end of year stockpile reconciliation closeout,
   the GACP will access the AF Supply Central DataBase (AFSCDB) Discoverer application to
   perform query operations from the legacy Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) to determine
   if munitions managed assets are on Air Force Base Supply records.

      require DDA approval prior to emergency disposal.
9.10. GACP Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Procedures.
   9.10.1. Munitions System Management. Determination for management through the
   munitions system is made by the PM.
      9.10.1.1. This determination is based on the ability to assign an existing (like item) T.O.,
      obtain SPI, account for items through CAS, budgeting and procurement requirements,
      and the ability to provide disposition for unserviceable and excess items.
          9.10.1.1.1. Because munitions items are centrally procured assets, they are generally
          prohibited from local purchase. Units can be authorized to locally procure munitions
          items with PM approval, however, to do so, the PM must provide the procurement
          funds, therefore, the PM must consider provisions of AFI 65-601, Vol. 1, Budget
          Guidance and Procedures related to local purchase (LP) of centrally procured items
          when making these decisions.
          9.10.1.1.2. When the PM has approved a waiver for local purchase of centrally
          procured items, and the local base supply officer (MASO for munitions) approves the
          transaction, use customer funds for initial and follow-on procurement.
      9.10.1.2. If the PM determines requested munitions are not manageable within the
      munitions system, the request may proceed for interim HC and NNMSB safety
      certification.
   9.10.2. NNMSB Certification. COTS munitions purchase request data packages will be
   reviewed by GACP CMPM for completeness to provide the NNMSB with sufficient
   information to certify COTS munitions for Air Force use. If additional data is required,
   NNMSB member(s) will coordinate through GACP CMPM.
   9.10.3. HC includes assigning hazard class and division, compatibility group, UN number,
   and explosive weight. An IHC or HC must be assigned prior to placing munitions into
   operational service.
      9.10.3.1. The Air Force Safety Center assigns final HC for Air Force munitions upon
      completion of formal testing and/or analysis IAW T.O. 11A-1-47.
      9.10.3.2. IHC requests are submitted through the GACP website. An IHC will be issued
      for a period of one year. Extensions may be granted provided the requesting unit provides
 210                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


       complete justification and has submitted data to the CMPM to obtain a final hazard
       classification.
       9.10.3.3. COTS munitions packages disapproved for IHC or final HC will be returned to
       the requesting unit. COTS munitions with expired IHC will not be used until revalidated
       or final HC is approved.
   9.10.4. Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program. The GACP and the NNMSB approves
   BASH munitions using the procedures prescribed in paragraph 7.24.8.5 and 9.10.2.
9.11. Conventional Munitions Product Assurance Management.
   9.11.1. Life-Cycle Management Concept - Introduction: Product assurance concerns exist
   from the inception of a munitions item until it is properly disposed. With this in mind,
   personnel at all echelons are stakeholders in the process. This entails proper design, life
   cycle testing, the inspection process and reporting of discrepancies. These procedures are
   essential for establishing the foundation of product assurance for munitions.
       9.11.1.1. All higher headquarters and management activities with units that use
       conventional munitions items have product assurance duties:
          9.11.1.1.1. Ensure subordinate organizations establish viable product assurance
          programs according to paragraph 3.1 and use PQDR, AFTO Form 22, AFTO Form
          102 or alternative electronic means to identify munitions reliability, maintainability,
          or deficiency concerns to the responsible AFMC ALC.
          9.11.1.1.2. Screen safety and accident investigation reports and ensures any
          munitions issues are referred to the appropriate ALC.
          9.11.1.1.3. Ensure procedures to monitor and survey condition of munitions in
          storage and service are complied with.
          9.11.1.1.4. Evaluate skills and personnel who conduct product assurance and identify
          training requirements to the Career Field Manager (CFM) and AETC during the
          U&TW.
          9.11.1.1.5. Review reliability and maintainability reports from the ALCs and
          determine minimum acceptable performance criteria below which munitions have no
          identifiable combat utility. Coordinate with HQ AF and the responsible ALC to
          remove from service and inventory, or restrict to training use only, those items that
          fall below established combat performance criteria.
          9.11.1.1.6. If charged with developing mission need statements, ensure to indicate
          assets must be made available for life-cycle testing. Also, incorporate design and
          inspection desires to ensure asset reliability while minimizing manpower impacts.
          9.11.1.1.7. Participate in forums and working groups to resolve product assurance
          problems.
          9.11.1.1.8. Assess the effectiveness of munitions product assurance programs during
          unit-level surveillance visits.
       9.11.1.2. AFMC has the primary responsibility for munitions product assurance to
       include:
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                 211


        9.11.1.2.1. Ensuring resource allocation to support product assurance commensurate
        with the importance of high quality and reliable munitions.
        9.11.1.2.2. Investigating munitions deficiencies reported by using commands and
        units. Report reliability and maintainability results from investigations and
        surveillance testing to using commands. The ALCs will establish tracking systems to
        monitor trends and analyze data. The ALCs will provide MAJCOMs and other
        customers with reports to provide results of the data analysis.
        9.11.1.2.3. Establishing, maintaining, and managing technical information and
        content for inspecting, testing, storing, maintaining, handling, transporting,
        packaging, preserving, disposing, reconditioning, modifying, renovating and
        containerizing conventional munitions.
        9.11.1.2.4. Ensuring surveillance is maintained over Air Force munitions stored by
        other Services. This includes ensuring the storing service is properly using allocated
        funds to store, inspect and maintain munitions.
        9.11.1.2.5. Conducting surveillance visits to other services’ storage sites containing
        Air Force assets every 2 years to determine the effectiveness of their munitions
        product assurance program. At the end of surveillance visit, conduct an out briefing
        with the other services’ representatives to discuss noted deficiencies. Furnish a
        detailed written report of the surveillance visit to the agencies responsible for storage
        site. Report will identify all deficiencies, their main causes, recommended changes,
        training requirements and personnel contacted during the visit. Furnish the Air Staff,
        Lead MAJCOMs and the ARC a copy of the written report on the status of the Air
        Force stockpile stored at other services’ sites.9.11.2. Product Design.
     9.11.2.1. Design Considerations.
        9.11.2.1.1. Product assurance for conventional munitions must begin during the
        conceptual phase of the acquisition process and be continued throughout the life-
        cycle of the item.
        9.11.2.1.2. Munitions agencies ensure consideration is given to the operating
        environment faced by munitions. Munitions are stockpiled for extended periods,
        withdrawn, and cycled from a ready state back to storage numerous times before
        finally being employed or disposed of. In the case of some munitions, electrical
        continuity tests or power-on operations may be a part of this cycling.
        9.11.2.1.3. Munitions require a dual consideration of reliability. Munitions must
        perform their mission on demand (performance) and must not function prematurely,
        inadvertently, or in some other unexpected manner (safety). Both aspects of
        reliability must be monitored and stringently controlled to ensure combat readiness is
        maintained and unintended personnel injury or property damage is prevented.
        9.11.2.1.4. Future maintenance requirements, such as component access for periodic
        inspection requirements, must be considered in the design stage. Additionally,
        adequate attention must be given to packaging, handling, storage, and transporting
        requirements, to include explosive HC for transportation and storage as well as the
        operational (ground handling/storage and flying) environment. Design criteria must
212                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


         also include environmental protection issues for consideration during daily use and
         for disposal purposes.
         9.11.2.1.5. Accurate configuration control of the items must be maintained.
         Changing NSNs of an item after modifications or TCTO changes promotes
         configuration control.
         9.11.2.1.6. Ensure throughout the munitions item life-cycle that accurate
         configuration control of the item engineering design is maintained.
         9.11.2.1.7. During design phase, consideration must be given to the future need to
         demilitarize/dispose of the item and, where possible, materials are selected that make
         this process easier. Lean towards reclamation potential as much as possible.
             9.11.2.1.7.1. AFMC implements Design for Demilitarization ‘DEMIL’ (DFD) as
             an acquisition initiative into the systems engineering process for all newly
             developed ammunition items and those undergoing engineering changes or
             renovation and maintenance.
             9.11.2.1.7.2. Military Service material developers will follow guidance and best
             management practices provided by SMCA, to influence ammunition design in
             order to facilitate ‘DEMIL’ operations. The goal is to increase R3, reduced
             execution cost, minimized reuse/disposal costs, enhanced safety, and
             environmental compliance.
             9.11.2.1.7.3. Provide representatives from both the acquisition and ‘DEMIL’
             functional areas to participate in the DFD program.
         9.11.2.1.8. Provide Technical Data packages for newly fielded conventional
         ammunitions and components to allow characterization and development of DEMIL
         plans and technologies.
      9.11.2.2. Initial service life and shelf life dates for munitions are based on design,
      manufacturing processes, materials and performance testing.
  9.11.3. Product Assurance Procedures.
      9.11.3.1. Product Assurance Reporting.
         9.11.3.1.1. All Munitions Squadrons, Flights, Elements and Munitions-using
         organizations have key product assurance responsibilities to formally report any/all
         conditions that could lead to injury or prevent a munitions item from functioning
         properly. Reporting methods are outlined in paragraph 3.1.1.
         9.11.3.1.2. Munitions-Managing Organizations.
             9.11.3.1.2.1. Report to munitions-using organizations by official e-mail anytime
             munitions items are placed into a suspended or restricted status.
             9.11.3.1.2.2. Report back to the submitting organization within 72 hours upon
             receipt of a PQDR. Acknowledge receipt of PQDR and provide any additional
             information regarding resolution of problem.
             9.11.3.1.2.3. If involved in the investigation of an accident or incident involving
             munitions, provide an initial assessment to other potential users of the asset.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                               213


     9.11.3.2. Munitions Inspections and Surveillance:
        9.11.3.2.1. Munitions activities and munitions-using organizations perform required
        inspections IAW paragraph 3.1.1.
        9.11.3.2.2. Munitions-Managing Organizations.
            9.11.3.2.2.1. Issue special and one-time inspection guidance and procedures as
            required.
            9.11.3.2.2.2. Ensure product assurance responsibilities are met for munitions
            items managed by other services.
     9.11.3.3. Mishap and Incident Investigations. The GACP maintains a MRRT of
     personnel knowledgeable in all aspects of munitions and capable of responding to
     munitions incidents. Procedures for contacting team are provided in paragraph 2.5.20.1.
     9.11.3.4. Testing. Most munitions are ‘one-shot’ devices. Reliability for ‘one-shot’
     devices with time-dependent failure characteristics cannot be measured absolutely.
     Therefore, inferences must be made on reliability and useful life based on observing the
     performance of representative samples.
        9.11.3.4.1. Munitions-managing organizations ensure procurement of munitions
        items includes sufficient quantities for surveillance and aging testing throughout the
        forecast life-cycle of the item. Also ensure procurement includes sufficient assets for
        explosives safety and disposal testing.
        9.11.3.4.2. Ensure munitions test information and all available historical data (ADR,
        PQDR, CAS Inspection History, etc) is used to periodically update munitions
        performance and reliability data and revise munitions inspection and surveillance
        intervals in appropriate technical data.
        9.11.3.4.3. Product Development Testing. Good documentation of item performance
        during product development testing is essential to long-term product assurance.
            9.11.3.4.3.1. Ensure Explosive HC test data and detailed performance data are
            incorporated in munitions surveillance plans.
            9.11.3.4.3.2. Ensure Lot Acceptance Test (LAT) data is captured and
            incorporated in surveillance plans.
        9.11.3.4.4. Surveillance Testing. Surveillance testing is intended to detect and
        measure the gradual changes in munitions before those changes cause the item and/or
        system to fail. Predicting future changes based on current measurements allows shelf
        life and service determinations. While operational tests and training events
        demonstrate whether a munitions system functioned or not, little useful surveillance
        information is usually obtained.
            9.11.3.4.4.1. Perform failure analysis testing if necessary to isolate causes of
            munitions failures and to determine if problem is widespread.
            9.11.3.4.4.2. Perform periodic testing of munitions to assess the impacts of aging
            on item reliability and performance. Testing should not only include those
            explosive components which suffer from chemical deterioration but any
214                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


             component of the munitions system which is critical to system operation and
             safety.
             9.11.3.4.4.3. Match test frequency to predicted item deterioration or to impact of
             item failure. When determining what munitions to test, consider high flight-hour
             accumulation of certain assets.
      9.11.3.5. Reliability Assessment and Product Deficiencies.
         9.11.3.5.1. Product Assurance Standards.
             9.11.3.5.1.1. Munitions-using and munitions-managing organizations establish
             performance and reliability standards during item development. Document the
             performance standards in Mission Needs Statements (MNS) and Capability
             Production Document (CPD) as well as surveillance test plans.
             9.11.3.5.1.2. If determined appropriate, negotiate product warranties and
             guarantees with the item developer. Manage the warranted item to ensure
             warranty conditions are not violated and conduct surveillance testing of the item
             prior to warranty expiration to insure it meets warranted standards.
         9.11.3.5.2. Product Assessment.
             9.11.3.5.2.1. Munitions-management organizations gather munitions performance
             information from all available sources in reaching a product reliability
             assessment.
             9.11.3.5.2.2. Compile information from munitions inspections conducted by both
             munitions-using and managing organizations.
             9.11.3.5.2.3. Ensure performance reports are received from operational
             evaluations of combat weapon systems and a solid review is conducted.
             9.11.3.5.2.4. PQDRs provide useful information about the failure modes of an
             item and organizations are required to use the PQDR process to identify
             munitions failures and discrepancies.
             9.11.3.5.2.5. Surveillance testing will continue to provide the bulk of product
             assurance information and a test program must be conducted periodically
             throughout an item's service life.
         9.11.3.5.3. Product Analysis.
             9.11.3.5.3.1. Use actual test data when available for reliability determination and
             service life prediction.
             9.11.3.5.3.2. Long Range Services Life Analysis (LRSLA) is a structural failure
             prediction model, which assists in establishing the service life of missile
             propulsion systems. Other computer models are coming into use to assist in
             determining reliability and service life of other conventional munitions items and
             their use is strongly encouraged.
             9.11.3.5.3.3. If product performance has changed, (e.g., range, accuracy,
             lethality, etc.) ensure using commands and the Joint Munitions Effectiveness
             Manuals (JMEM) group are made aware of the current level of performance.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  215


         9.11.3.5.4. Product Deficiency. When munitions are reported (through any means) to
         the PM or IM as deficient through inspection, testing, failure or any other means, a
         number of actions become possible.
            9.11.3.5.4.1. Item(s), SN(s), or lot number(s) restriction or suspension.
                9.11.3.5.4.1.1. Restriction or suspension of a munitions item is usually an
                interim action until one or more of the actions listed in paragraphs 9.11.3.5
                are taken.
                9.11.3.5.4.1.2. Restrict an item when it does not conform to all specifications
                but is still serviceable for certain applications.
                9.11.3.5.4.1.3. Suspend an item when its true condition is not known, it is
                determined unserviceable, or its service life has expired. Additional
                information on CCs for munitions is contained in T.O. 11A-1-10.
            9.11.3.5.4.2. Warranty Action.
                9.11.3.5.4.2.1. If a deficient item was procured with a manufacturer's
                warranty, invoke the warranty.
                9.11.3.5.4.2.2. Ensure appropriate program management personnel are aware
                of warranty conditions and expiration dates.
            9.11.3.5.4.3. Accept deficiency - adjust service life. Occasionally the munitions-
            using and managing organizations will reach agreement that a munitions
            deficiency is too costly to correct, the asset is too mission-critical to restrict, or
            has insufficient impact on system performance to warrant correction.
                9.11.3.5.4.3.1. If appropriate, adjust the service life of the item or the use
                restriction code.
                9.11.3.5.4.3.2. If the deficiency changes the performance of a system, ensure
                all appropriate technical manuals are updated with the correct information.
            9.11.3.5.4.4. Initiate product improvement program. The decision to correct an
            item deficiency is jointly reached by the munitions-using and managing
            organizations.
            9.11.3.5.4.5. Dispose or retire an item. Munitions items that have reached the
            end of their service life, as well as those of questionable reliability, must be
            retired from the inventory.
  9.11.4. Additional Product Assurance Responsibilities.
     9.11.4.1. Lead MAJCOM. All munitions items have a designated Lead MAJCOM.
     AFMC is the Lead MAJCOM for most munitions items, however, ACC, AFSOC, and
     AMC have specific Lead MAJCOM responsibilities for munitions due to Operational
     Test & Evaluation (OT&E) requirements for emerging systems and unique SOF or MAF
     requirements. These Lead MAJCOMs will:
         9.11.4.1.1. Ensure that munitions concerns are closely worked with the managing
         organization until resolution.
216                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


         9.11.4.1.2. Identify to the GACP, munitions items that are obsolete so disposition
         actions can be initiated.
      9.11.4.2. Munitions/Missile PIWGs are conducted by the Munitions Product Group IAW
      AFI 21-118, Improving Air and Space Equipment Reliability and Maintainability,
      Chapter 3 to improve product reliability and maintainability. Minimum PIWG
      membership composition includes the single manager(s), system support manager(s),
      Lead Command Executive Agent, and a representative from each of using command.
  9.11.5. Requests to Modify Inspection Interval Requirements.
      9.11.5.1. Requests to change inspection/surveillance intervals for munitions items may
      require T.O. changes. Submit these requests using AFTO Form 22.
         9.11.5.1.1. Do not submit requests on items under warranty. Requests must be
         inclusive of the NSN and not individual lots or local storage or handling conditions.
         9.11.5.1.2. Requests will include Lead MAJCOM coordinated data and justification
         to increase or decrease in inspection or surveillance requirements. EXAMPLE:
         Surveillance interval data, quantity of items inspected, defects discovered, type of
         defects discovered, defect rates, number of ADR submitted, number of QDRs
         submitted, etc.
         9.11.5.1.3. Once coordinated by Lead MAJCOM munitions staffs, the Lead
         MAJCOM forwards the AFTO Form 22 to the GACP who will then forward the
         request to the appropriate office for evaluation. The ES will respond to these requests
         using normal AFTO Form 22 response procedures.
      9.11.5.2. Procedures above do not preclude Air Staff or Lead MAJCOM from requesting
      broad management analysis or review of munitions items or an item series for special
      review or analysis based on prevailing field conditions. These requests should be fully
      supported by field level data and information.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                 217


                                          Chapter 10

                  WAR READINESS MATERIEL (WRM) MUNITIONS

10.1. General. WRM munitions are required to support wartime activities listed in the AF War
and Mobilization Plan (WMP) until the industrial base meets wartime demands. The forward
presence stressed in the defense planning guidance (DPG) demands WRM munitions to be stored
or moved quickly to critical areas. WRM munitions are pre-positioned at operating bases,
dispersed in areas of responsibility, placed aboard APF vessels, and stored at selected units and
depots for surface or air deployment.
   10.1.1. Refer to Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information for
   definitions of the War Mobilization Plan (WMP), Vol. 1 through Vol. 5, Logistics Feasibility
   Analysis Capability (LOGFAC) , WCDO, NCAA, TAMP, and DLAR.
   10.1.2. Refer to paragraph 3.6 for instructions and guidance on classifying information
   used, controlled, or produced from manual or automated munitions systems.
10.2. Positioning Objectives. The NAF/Lead Command will provide units with WRM
munitions positioning objectives using the WCDO for wartime requirements. AFI 25-101,
WCDO procedures will be used. In addition, the most recent NCAA CTR pre-positioning
objective for each theater will be used. For OCONUC Component MAJCOMs (USAFE,
PACAF, and AFCENT) this is the CTR Starter Stock. For other MAJCOMs this is the CTR for
all theaters supported.
10.3. War Consumables Distribution Objective (WCDO).
   10.3.1. The WCDO is developed in LOGFAC where the Air Force WMP-4 resides. The
   NCAA interfaces with LOGFAC. LOGFAC distributes the NCAA theater requirement to
   operating bases and results are published on the unit WCDO. In addition to the information
   below, refer to the WCDO process outlined in AFI 25-101.
   10.3.2. For all WRM commodities, including munitions, the WCDO serves as the theater
   positioning objectives for each DoDAAC.
   10.3.3. The WCDO provides authorizations for starter stock munitions to support OPLAN
   execution.
   10.3.4. Operations, munitions, plans, and intelligence functions cooperate to produce the
   theater WCDO.
       10.3.4.1. The NCAA establishes munitions requirements. AF/A5R-C provides NCAA
       theater requirement interface file to the LOGFAC SPO for inclusion into LOGFAC. The
       MAJCOM/NAF logistic planners in coordination with Operations distribute the NCAA
       CTR to build the theater WCDO.
       10.3.4.2. MAJCOM/NAF logistics planners produce and coordinate the WCDO prior to
       distribution to unit WRM managers and the MASO. The theater WCDO will match the
       NCAA CTR for the given theater.
   10.3.5. Munitions WRM distribution and realignment is performed through the GAP process
   IAW Chapter 15.

10.4. WRM Munitions Financial Accounting.
   10.4.1. In addition to the below information, refer to AFI 25-101 for additional guidance and
   procedures.
   10.4.2. The MAJCOM (including ARC) munitions staff (or equivalent) advises the
   MAJCOM A4 Resources Division on command/theater O&M WRM munitions budget
   requirements.
   10.4.3. The MAJCOM Program Element Manager (PEM), in coordination with its FMB,
   distributes WRM funds to authorized base-level activities, monitors fund disbursement, and
   expenditure and recommends reprogramming actions.
   10.4.4. The MAJCOM PEM validates unit unfunded or unprogrammed requirements.
   10.4.5. The MAJCOM A4 munitions staff in coordination with the MAJCOM PEM and
   Lead Command advises units on submission of the PEC 28030 budget.
10.5. Planning Logistics Support.
   10.5.1. All US Air Force war or contingency plans must contain a logistics annex
   sufficiently detailed to enable personnel to support the planned operation immediately and
   efficiently. Lead MAJCOMs and NAFs develop the munitions appendix to this annex.
   10.5.2. Component services manage logistics support. Each service determines its
   requirements and budgets for necessary commodities. When produced, munitions and
   missiles become stock, owned by the individual service component.
   10.5.3. Unified commands are not responsible for logistics support of assigned forces.
   However, on execution of a unified OPLAN, the unified commander assumes directive
   authority over all components in the operating theater.
   10.5.4. The NAF will coordinate with the GACP and CAF/MAF Lead MAJCOMs (ACC
   and AMC) to plan logistics support requirements.
   10.5.5. MAJCOMs and CMAs (e.g., GACP) provide logistics support at and below wing- or
   base-level for assigned units.
   10.5.6. Where units are tenant, staging on or through, dispersing or operating from, or
   otherwise using installations assigned to other commands, the commander with jurisdiction
   over the installation provides logistics support as agreed between the involved MAJCOMS.
   10.5.7. Tenants coordinate support requirements with hosts before publishing any plan that
   commits host resources.
   10.5.8. OCONUS Supported/MAJCOMs (i.e., USAFE, PACAF, and AFCENT) in
   coordination with the appropriate NAF develop plans to receive and support augmenting
   forces. They provide all requirements for planned en route and beddown locations to
   facilitate reception and support planning.
   10.5.9. NAFs help unified commands assess reserve stocks of involved allies to identify
   potential US Air Force support requirements.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                               219


   10.5.10. Lead MAJCOMs and NAFs assist AFRC and ANG gained units to compute
   requirements, store and preposition materiel, and prepare for activation and deployment, as
   appropriate.
   10.5.11. HQ ACC, HQ AMC, and HQ AFSOC advise OCONUS Supported MAJCOMs of
   additional logistics support required for operations in the overseas area to ensure enough
   storage and maintenance capability. The GACP and NAFs coordinate with storing
   commands before acting to preposition any materiel or changing pre-positioning in WMP-4
   which would increase the consumable storage requirements.
   10.5.12. The SMCA operates IAW DoDD 5160.65, Single Manager for Conventional
   Ammunition (SMCA) and DoDI 5160.68, Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition
   (SMCA): Responsibilities of the SMCA, the Military Services, and United States Special
   Operations Command (USSOCOM) and plays a major role in the munitions re-supply of AF
   units. A significant amount of AF munitions are stored in CONUS Army depots. The GACP
   maintains oversight and surveillance of Air Force munitions stored in CONUS depot stock.
10.6. Logistics Planning for Munitions Movement.
   10.6.1. When unable to store WRM munitions at or near the employment base, NAFs in
   coordination with MAJCOM and GACP may position munitions in central storage areas,
   theater storage facilities, or at other operational bases. In these cases, the NAF develops
   detailed plans and establishes MOU as necessary to facilitate movement of stocks when they
   are needed at wartime operating locations.
   10.6.2. OPLANs may direct combat aircraft to deploy with munitions aboard. EXAMPLE:
   Air-to-air missiles, 20mm/30mm, or chaff and flare. NAFs identify and reflect these type
   movement requirements in MAJCOM or theater OPLANs and logistics movement plans.
   Execution of the OPLAN activates this phase of munitions relocation.
   10.6.3. The NAF and GACP optimize pre-positioning at planned operating bases given
   sortie production requirements, threat and storage and transportation capabilities.
   10.6.4. The NAF and the GACP track munitions requirements and distribution. They initiate
   munitions movements not already covered by tactical movement. The NAF TACP/RACP
   serve as consolidated command points of contact with inter-theater and intra-theater support
   organizations.
10.7. MAJCOM Command Overflow.
   10.7.1. The NAFs and CAF, MAF, and SOF Lead MAJCOMs (ACC, AMC, and AFSOC)
   must identify to GACP how much of each unit's WRM munitions requirement come from
   CONUS stocks or production.
   10.7.2. Once NAFs and Lead MAJCOMs determine these shortfalls, they submit them to
   GACP for sourcing.
   10.7.3. The GACP will:
      10.7.3.1. Source theater shortfall requirements, assures TPFDD transportation support,
      and publishes an approved AF support plan for each MAJCOM/theater OPLAN.
      Redistribution or realignment of AFRC or ANG assets will be coordinated with HQ
      AFRC or NGB.
 220                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


       10.7.3.2. Coordinate support plans with the affected MAJCOM s/NAFs.
       10.7.3.3. Satisfy the planned requirements of the MAJCOM/NAF as far as possible,
       including worldwide redistribution and asset realignment, and delivery of substitute
       munitions when preferred assets are not available.
       10.7.3.4. Ensure command overflow shipments reflect the following:
          10.7.3.4.1. Receiving DoDAAC.
          10.7.3.4.2. Shipping DoDAAC (when possible).
          10.7.3.4.3. Sequence of execution.
          10.7.3.4.4. Required Delivery Date (RDD).
          10.7.3.4.5. Port of Embarkation (POE).
          10.7.3.4.6. Port of Debarkation (POD).
          10.7.3.4.7. Type of movement (air, surface, unit move or deployment).
       10.7.3.5. Develop support plans based on approved time-phased requirements. These
       requirements come from the Wartime Aircraft Activity (WAA) file approved for the
       planned year. Include outload and receipt capacity of break bulk/CADS points, ports,
       and receiving units in support plans to ensure all the munitions that are scheduled to
       arrive within a specified time period can be off-loaded and stored for use.
   10.7.4. All executing activities maintain plans with changes as they occur. They must
   ensure current and executable information is available to the SMCA, GACP, NAFs, and
   shipping and receiving units. EXAMPLE: When a NAF (TACP/RACP) calls forward an
   item into the operational theater, the executing activity accordingly reduces the command
   overflow.
10.8. Munitions Call-forward.
   10.8.1. GACP: Coordinates requisitions with the U.S. Army Joint Munitions Command
   (JMC) to meet MAJCOM RDDs.
   10.8.2. JMC in-turn will submit the requisition to SMCA, SDDC and Military Sealift
   Command (MSC) as required for movement to meet RDD.
10.9. Standard Air Munitions Packages (STAMP).
   10.9.1. STAMP enables pre-selected or notional tasked tactical air units to deploy rapidly
   and operate from locations without prepositioned munitions or until sustained re-supply lines
   can be established. STAMP assets may also be tasked for surface movement (truck, rail, or
   vessel) to meet planned sustaining requirements when logistics lead-times allow such
   activity. Sortie rates, aircraft configurations, and logistics planning lead-time dictate the
   period of support from STAMP. See paragraph 11.2 for sourcing procedures.
   10.9.2. In addition to STAMP, theaters may request and establish TARRP programs within
   the operational theater to realign theater stocks in the early stages of a contingency. TARRPs
   are designed and set-up primarily as air-cargo movement assets, however, may move by
   surface modes when logistics lead-times allow.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                              221


   10.9.3. The AF has configured APF vessels to provide component commanders greater
   deployment flexibility by reducing early swing-stock requirements supported by airlift. APF
   allows strategic swing-stock munitions to move rapidly from one region to another as
   priorities or circumstances dictate. See paragraph 11.2 for sourcing procedures.
10.10. War Reserve Stocks for Allies (WRSA).
   10.10.1. WRSA comprises US military service-owned stocks intended for use in
   emergencies only to make up for shortfalls in allied ATOs. Higher headquarters must
   approve release of WRSA to allies during peacetime.
   10.10.2. Agencies controlling WRSA and MOU stocks use these guidelines when
   developing joint operating instructions with allied nations.
   10.10.3. Manage WRSA assets on a separate DoDAAC, because item prices are constrained
   to the item's original acquisition cost or the approved negotiated WRSA price.
      10.10.3.1. Manage the WRSA inventory as other Air Force WRM munitions.
      10.10.3.2. Apply the same security measures to WRSA authorizations, levels, quantities
      and other parameters as you would to WRM.
      10.10.3.3. Keep WRSA at authorized and approved levels.
      10.10.3.4. Identify shortfalls to the NAF, MAJCOM, and GACP for resolution.
      10.10.3.5. WRSA stock will be segregated from the AF stockpile whenever storage
      space is available. If munitions must be commingled, WRSA stock will be appropriately
      identified.
      10.10.3.6. Never use WRSA assets to satisfy other requirements (RDO, training, etc.)
      without NAF and GACP approval. Report to the owning NAF/MAJCOM any action
      initiated at the local-level that changes the identity or serviceability of WRSA assets.
      10.10.3.7. When the GACP directs the TACP/RACP to release WRSA stocks, the
      TACP/RACP may transfer assets either in-mass to the allied user or selectively based on
      allied ATO shortfalls. Restrictions on release of WRSA items are as follows:
          10.10.3.7.1. Do not release munitions excluded by NAF/GACP (e.g., AIMs) without
          AF/A4LW and AF/A5R-C approval.
          10.10.3.7.2. Do not exceed dollar value (congressional authority) assigned to the
          WRSA.
          10.10.3.7.3. Stop releasing WRSA assets when you reach the assigned dollar value.
          Obtain release authority and process additional requirements through FMS IAW
          paragraph 9.6.
      10.10.3.8. When WRSA release notification is received from the appropriate authority,
      assets can be either transferred in-mass or selectively based on allied ATO shortfalls.
      10.10.3.9. Apply the MOA or other authorizing document between the US Government
      and the allied country when selling assets designated as WRSA in a military emergency.
      10.10.3.10. Proper authority may direct munitions accounts to release munitions other
      than WRSA under a follow-on MOU to support allied shortfalls.
222                          AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


      10.10.3.11. Release or Transfer Procedures. On receiving a RDO for WRSA or MOU
      release, affected bases prepare two sets of DD Form 1348-1A IAW AFMAN 23-110,

                                           Chapter 11

                       MUNITIONS CONTINGENCY SOURCING

11.1. Purpose. This chapter outlines contingency munitions sourcing for Air Force activities
and establishes a standard munitions report. The Munitions reporting process will provide the
CJCS, Combatant Commanders, and Air Force activities the ability to monitor critical munitions
items, affecting warfighting capabilities during contingencies, emergencies, or exercises. In
addition, the reported information will be used in support of JMPAB deliberations. AF/A4LW
and AF/A5R-C represent the AF on the Munitions JMPAB.
11.2. Contingency Munitions Sourcing Process. The munitions allocation process described
in paragraph 14.3 is a peacetime pre-positioning process. Once contingency sourcing begins,
all munitions balances are available to support contingency operations.
   11.2.1. The MAJCOM/NAF (TACP/RACP) maintain authority and control for directing
   intra theater or intra command munitions movements to support operations. The
   MAJCOM/NAF directs units for these movements through official SIPRNET, email, or
   secure fax.
   11.2.2. CAS RDOs will be initiated by the GACP upon specific direction from the
   MAJCOM/NAF requiring the move.
   11.2.3. When operational contingency requirements exceed theater availability or cannot be
   satisfied with munitions in the operational theater, the MAJCOM /NAF requests contingency
   sourcing to the GACP. The following process outlines contingency munitions requests:
       11.2.3.1. To facilitate rapid contingency support, before operations commence, submit
       copies of supported OPLANs/ CONPLANs that source STAMP, STRAPP, or APF to the
       GACP with informational copies to AF/A4LW and AF/A5R-C.
       11.2.3.2. The MAJCOM/NAF (TACP/RACP) identifies and request sourcing of
       munitions to meet operational contingency requirements to the GACP via official
       SIPRNET, email or secure fax. Provide the following information:
          11.2.3.2.1. Type of munitions/munitions components required by NSN.
          11.2.3.2.2. Quantity required.
          11.2.3.2.3. Ship to Location/DoDAAC.
          11.2.3.2.4. Required in-place date.
          NOTE: Requests for ASM (AIM-9, AIM-120, AGM-88, or ADM-160B) are
          submitted to the GACP (Robins AFB) who will coordinate sourcing IAW the TAMP.
       11.2.3.3. The GACP will coordinate all sourcing requests for STAMP/STRAPP and
       constrained munitions assets in short supply to meet operational contingency
       requirements to AF/A5R-C for approval and AF/A4LW for concurrence.
       11.2.3.4. The GACP will provide availability and sourcing options to AF/A5R-C and
       AF/A4LW for decision-making.
224                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


      11.2.3.5. AF/A5R-C and AF/A4LW will provide approve/disapproval and concurrence
      as appropriate.
      11.2.3.6. The GACP will notify the requesting MAJCOM/NAF (TACP/RACP) of
      availability and approval/disapproval for TPFDD action.
  11.2.4. Munitions Contingency Reporting Procedures: AF/A4LW or AF/A5R-C directs
  when the AF MUREP is submitted to the Air Staff. MAJCOMs and NAFs may implement
  MUREP to support theater contingencies, exercises, or training events. When directed, units
  submit MUREP to their MAJCOM, and NAF as appropriate who will consolidate reports and
  forward to the GACP. Reports address the status of all theater assigned munitions within
  their operational control to include APF assigned assets. The GACP consolidates reports and
  submits to AF/A4LW and AF/A5R-C.
      11.2.4.1. MUREP Reporting Timelines and Suspense: The report cutoff time will be
      daily as of 2400Z (Zulu Time) with a transmission time NLT 0300Z the following day to
      the MAJCOM, and NAF. Consolidated reports (with attached supporting spreadsheets)
      are due to GACP NLT 0900Z daily. GACP will forward consolidated AF MUREP to
      AF/A4LW and AF/A5R-C NLT 1500Z daily or as directed. Reports will be numbered
      sequentially and will cover the 24-hours immediately preceding the cutoff time.
      11.2.4.2. Report Transfer: MUREP reports will be classified SECRET. The MAJCOM
      and NAF reports will be submitted to the GACP via official classified e-mail via the
      SIPRNET to the GACP: gacp@hill.af.smil.mil. If classified e-mail is not available,
      submit reports via secure fax or secure telephone to DSN: 777-2666 by line item. The
      format for the MUREP is an excel spreadsheet.
      11.2.4.3. Specific MUREP Reporting Instructions:
         11.2.4.3.1. Items to be reported will be identified at implementation. Items will be
         reported by:
             11.2.4.3.1.1. DODIC or CRC as required.
             11.2.4.3.1.2. Report all combat-usable CR capable assets (including all stocks
             except CC-F, -G, -H, -J, -L, -P or -V) in the priority build outlined by AF/A5R-C.
             11.2.4.3.1.3. Items that are reported by CRC will use priority build reporting
             (identify priority build in Part II).
             11.2.4.3.1.4. On-hand quantities will be reported as the assets arrive regardless of
             location or off-load status (to include APF munitions). All munitions data will be
             recorded as each (EA).
             11.2.4.3.1.5. WRSA assets will be reported as separate line entries.
             11.2.4.3.1.6. If no changes in data occur, the report will indicate no change from
             status report Date Time Group (DTG) of last report in the remarks section.
             11.2.4.3.1.7. MUREP Format: The MUREP will be submitted in a two-part
             format. Ensure the Report ‘as of’ Julian Date and Base/DoDAAC designators are
             included.
                11.2.4.3.1.7.1. Part I - Critical Munitions Item Status: Data is reported with
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                           225

                                        Chapter 13

    MUNITIONS INFORMATION SYSTEMS (MIS) PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

13.1. Munitions Information Systems (MIS) Requirement Process.
   13.1.1. The MIS requirements process involves all centrally managed information systems
   used by the munitions communities to include: CAS, TMRS, IMDS/G081, and AIT.
   13.1.2. AF/A4LW will advocate for validated MIS requirements. Successful advocacy of
   MIS requirements requires adequate preparation, presentation, planning and programming
   actions before presentation of initiatives to the A4 Requirements Board (A4RB) for
   prioritization, approval, and funding.
   13.1.3. The MIS requirements process provides a means to:
      13.1.3.1. Enable AF/A4LW and Lead MAJCOMs to bring Information Technology (IT)
      requirements and maintenance/sustainment actions forward as potential solutions for AF
      prioritization, approval, and funding. Lead Commands request input on IT requirements
      and maintenance/sustainment actions and potential solutions from Supported Commands
      prior to presenting new requirements or maintenance/sustainment actions to AF/A4LW.
      Annually, the CAS PMO will confer with the CAF Lead Command and HQ
      AFMC/A4MW to develop agreement and priorities for submission of future CAS
      requirements and maintenance/sustainment actions before submission to AF/A4LW.
      NOTE: In this paragraph, the term "requirements" describe new changes/enhancement to
      the CAS application/database. The term "maintenance/sustainment" describes CAS
      actions to repair DR as well as daily data management efforts.
      13.1.3.2. Improve cross-flow of information on IT solutions currently in use, test, or
      development.
      13.1.3.3. Share information and standardize capabilities and solutions to reduce
      duplication of effort and waste of resources resulting from developing IT solutions that
      already exist or are in development elsewhere. The EAF concept requires standard
      solutions that are interoperable between organizations, MAJCOMs, and the Air Force.
      13.1.3.4. Develop fielding plans for IT solutions recommended for AF wide
      implementation (to include training and funding requirements).
      13.1.3.5. Establishment of work priorities for CAS PMO and approves software
      configuration changes to CAS.
   13.1.4. All IT requirements must be staffed, coordinated, approved, and funded by the
   AF/A4I, Directorate of Transformation.13.1.4.1. AF/A4LW is the munitions conduit to
   AF/A4I. Munitions IT requirements will be coordinated and staffed through the Lead
   MAJCOM to AF/A4LW. AF/A4LW will present all initiatives to AF/A4I.
      13.1.4.1. Any MIS or IT solution presented for Air Force approval must be sponsored by
      a Lead MAJCOM or AF/A4LW to be put forward to AF/A4I.
      13.1.4.2. All submissions for new MIS or IT requirements, concepts, or solutions must
      demonstrate a valid need supported by metrics or test data to support the proposal.
 234                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


          13.1.4.2.1. Presenters should be prepared to answer the following questions, at a
          minimum:
              13.1.4.2.1.1. Does a requirement exist for this initiative?
              13.1.4.2.1.2. Does a similar solution already exist?
              13.1.4.2.1.3. What are the estimated costs to implement the solution?
              13.1.4.2.1.4. Are developmental funding costs being requested?
              13.1.4.2.1.5. What are the benefits to the AF?
              13.1.4.2.1.6. Is the proposed/identified solution proprietary?
       13.1.4.3. The CAS PMO will develop and present results of any technical evaluations
       they perform on recommended CAS solutions to ensure they are compliant with system
       architecture, security, safety, and interoperability standards.
   13.1.5. Responsibilities.
       13.1.5.1. AF/A4LW will:
          13.1.5.1.1. Make final decisions on recommended priorities to AF/A4I for CAS
          requirements.
          13.1.5.1.2. Submit MIS requirements to the AF/A4I Portfolio Manager for
          competition, prioritization, approval, and documentation in the Expectation
          Management Agreement.
       13.1.5.2. The CAS PMO will perform cost estimation, technical evaluation, and
       implementation review for submitted CAS requirements.
13.2. CAS System Management Procedures. Functional System Administrator (SA)
responsibilities to support the CAS application software residing on the Global Combat Support
System-Air Force Integrated Framework (GCSS-AFF) are described below. The Air Force
authorizes access levels to empower the lowest management levels, minimize functional and
MAJCOM involvement, simplify administration tasks, and decentralize execution, to implement
enterprise standards. These procedures clarify separation of duties required by personnel
supporting the three-tier level (PMO/MAJCOM/Base) CAS application software residing on the
Air Force Portal.
   13.2.1. The CAS PMO (ESC/HGGI) is responsible for the overall functional administration
   of the CAS application software residing on the GCSS-AF Integrated Framework (IF). The
   CAS PMO will appoint functional system administrators (FSA) in writing. The appointed
   FSAs will grant CAS Admin and Users privileges to authorized CAS users via the GCSS-AF
   IF. The FSA appointments will be validated annually. The CAS PMO will submit a
   memorandum to HQ GCSS-AF requesting the listed personnel be granted the CAS_ADMIN
   role, which in turn enables the CAS PMO the ability to grant or delete privileges to appointed
   MAJCOM and base level SAs.
   13.2.2. CAS Functional Overview. CAS supports AF combat and support units, GACP (Hill
   AFB and Robins AFB), TMCP (Robins AFB), AFCOMAC, and various munitions training
   centers. The objective of CAS is to improve Air Force combat and logistics capabilities by

  providing effective munitions management and accountability at each level of combat
  execution from the unit to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
  13.2.3. Contingencies and Alternate States/Modes of Operation. By design, there is no
  ‘degraded or alternate mode’ of CAS System operation. Automated processing requires a
  fully operational connectivity to the Internet. The primary mode of operation in the absence
  of Internet connectivity or computer support is through manual post-post procedures
  identified in Attachment 2, Off-line Processing (Post-Post).
  13.2.4. Security. The data and information handled by the CAS application operates at the
  unclassified sensitive level (FOUO).
  13.2.5. Automatic Information Technology (AIT). CAS is tasked to identify and implement
  approved automatic information technologies to improve munitions data collection and
  streamline munitions maintenance processes. These processes includes but not limited to the
  user of labeling and scanning of bar-codes, use of Radio Frequency Identification and mobile
  devices to provide data collection at the points of maintenance as event occur to improve data
  reliability and timeliness.
     13.2.5.1. CAS AIT software will utilize with the Air Force Enterprise Data Collection to
     standardize data collection and reuse of data across the Logistic community.
     Applications on mobile device will be tailored to improve processes while providing
     CAS the necessary information to create accountable the auditable transactions based on
     USERID and user permissions.
     13.2.5.2. AIT software will provide a CAS generated response for each transaction
     process providing either a ‘Success’ message or movement ‘Error’. Edit these
     transactions to correct any error for storage conditions (i.e., NEW, CIIC, compatibility).
     User will be notified if other conditions exist that prevent the transaction from processing
     correctly in CAS and these transaction will be captured in CAS AIT Conflict Resolution
     (AMP09A) program to allow user the correct the errors by editing the transaction or
     deleting the transaction.
  13.2.6. System Performance. Although numerous techniques exist for system performance
  measurement, throughput is of considerable importance to a user. The CAS processing
  environment permits application processing in an on-line, interactive mode with scheduled
  batch processes executing in background mode. Actual throughput is dependent upon the
  execution mode mix. EXAMPLE: The volume, execution request types, and number of
  users signed on at any point in time. Large file downloads should be run during end-of-day
  processing. Users need to be mindful that end-of-day processing in one time zone may
  impact users in different time zones.

  MUNITIONS REQUIREMENTS, ALLOCATIONS AND BUY-BUDGET PROCESS

14.1. Conventional Munitions Requirements. Munitions requirements are determined using
the guidance prescribed in DoDI 3000.04. The annual process to determine requirements is led
by AF/A5R-C. The process depicted in Figure 14.1, Air Force Conventional Munitions
Requirements Process produces a five-year munitions forecast that is the primary vehicle to
request and allocate air-to-ground and ground munitions required for test, training, and
operational needs. The most current allocation CAT Code and Requirements Codes can be
located on the GACP website (News & Info page) when developing forecasts and submitting
OOCR.
   14.1.1. Munitions Working Group (MWG). The purpose of the MWG is to educate the
   munitions requirements stakeholders on the process, update stakeholders on current
   munitions status, ensure accurate munitions and weapons effects data are utilized in analysis,
   and understand relevant changes to theater operations plans. Topics will include:
       14.1.1.1. Briefings on munitions in production/development, focused on employment
       issues and the operational impact of logistics supportability.
       14.1.1.2. Weapons System Evaluation Program (WSEP) reviews.
       14.1.1.3. Theater employment and HQ AF activities, process improvements, lessons
       learned, and action items pertaining to GAP, requirements, and stockpile allocations. The
       GACP provides an overview of the previous year’s GAP and major changes to
       forecasting procedures.
   14.1.2. Theater Working Group (TWG) meetings. The TWG meetings are an extension of
   the MWG during which AF/A5R-C NCAA branch visits NAFs as dictated by National
   Defense Strategy, Guidance for the Development of the Force (GDF), and MRP
   Implementation Guidance to refine munitions employment and utilization. The respective
   theater hosts the TWG meeting ensuring appropriate participation of theater warfighters.
   Representatives from operations, intelligence, plans and logistics shall attend these meetings
   to provide theater inputs and assumptions for the NCAA development process. These inputs
   and assumptions are then used to define each theater’s WRM and training requirements and
   expenditure per sortie factor (EPSF) rates.
   14.1.3. TAMP and Product Improvement Working Group (PIWG).                The annual TAMP
   PIWG is an AF/A5R-C sponsored, WR-ALC hosted event.
       14.1.3.1. The purpose of the TAMP/PIWG is to serve as a discussion forum and to make
       positioning decisions for existing air superiority missiles (e.g., AIM-9, AIM-120 and
       AGM-88).
       14.1.3.2. Agenda topics include: Briefings on air superiority munitions program and
       beddown updates, projected inventory status, test and evaluation requirements, WSEP
       status, CATM requirements, and allocation and requirements methodology.
14.2. Munitions Requirements Forecast Process. The munitions forecast is an annual process
to identify munitions requirements in Categories A, B, C, D, E, F, N, and T. The annual PCAR
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                              237


memorandum provides specific procedures and CAT Code definitions. The overall process is
described in the following paragraphs:
   14.2.1. Munitions requirements are derived from AFI 11-212; AFCATs 21-209, Vol. 1 and
   Vol. 2, and their associated GMAT tables on the GACP website; the Air Force Standard for
   Non-Expendable Air Munitions Training Authorizations, the UCML, test plans, expenditure
   history, bed-down plans, and the PCAR memorandum. Munitions requirements categories
   are defined in the PCAR memorandum.

Figure 14.1. Air Force Conventional Munitions Requirements Process.




   14.2.2. The GACP initiates the process in coordination with AF/A5R-C and AF/A4LW by
   providing the annual requirements forecast instructions to MAJCOM munitions staffs not
   later than 15 October. The forecast instruction memorandum notification will be e-mailed to
   MAJCOM and NAF MUFMs and munitions staffs and content posted to the GACP website.
   14.2.3. MAJCOM and NAF A4 munitions staffs will distribute requirements forecast
   instructions to the MAJCOM MUFMs and the unit MASOs. MUFMs will consolidate and
   validate munitions requirements and develop the consolidated forecast according to
   paragraph 9.7.

   14.2.4. Forecasting and Managing CAT Code B (non-NCAA WRM) Allocations. CAT
   Code B, Miscellaneous munitions authorizations are forecasted and allocated against
   requirement code BP using AFCAT 21-209, Vol. 1 and the GMAT for Ground Munitions on
   the GACP website. Approved allocations are distributed according to Table 14.1,
   Miscellaneous Munitions (Requirement Category BP) Distribution and the following:
       14.2.4.1. 100-percent of the OCONUS base-allocated quantity will be the OCONUS
       theater positioning objective. OCONUS units requisition shortages necessary to satisfy
       the entire allocation.
       14.2.4.2. 30-percent of the CONUS base-allocated quantity will be the CONUS base
       positioning objective. CONUS units, including ARC units, will only requisition
       shortages to position a maximum of 30-percent of the AMST allocated quantity at base-
       level. The MASO may submit ATRs to allocate the next higher QUP for each CONUS
       base mobility account. EXAMPLE: A unit authorized 90 rds of 9mm per AFCAT 21-
       209, Volume 1 and the GMAT table on the GACP website, is allocated 27 rds of 9mm
       (90 rds x .30 = 27 rds). An ATR increases the allocation to 30 rds allowing tasked
       personnel to travel with 2 full clips (2 clips x 15 rds = 30 rds).
       14.2.4.3. 45-percent of the total CONUS base-allocated quantity will be distributed
       among the OCONUS commands (15-percent each) as an OCONUS theater pre-
       positioning objective. CONUS units, including ARC units, will not requisition these
       quantities.
          14.2.4.3.1. 15-percent of the CONUS base-allocated quantity will be the OCONUS
          theater pre-positioning objective for each OCONUS command (PACAF, USAFE, and
          AFCENT). OCONUS commands will identify theater pre-positioning locations, by
          DoDAAC, and ensure the designated units requisition quantities necessary to satisfy
          the allocated pre-positioning quantity.
          14.2.4.3.2. If OCONUS commands cannot store CONUS pre-positioned assets at the
          intended base, the OCONUS command positions assets in-theater at a location that
          can support logistics movement.
          14.2.4.3.3. OCONUS commands ensure quantities in excess to OCONUS allocation
          are applied to the CONUS pre-positioned allocation before requisitioning. Only
          requisition pre-positioning quantities when existing assets do not satisfy the total
          OCONUS and CONUS pre-positioned allocation.
       14.2.4.4. 25-percent of the total CONUS allocated quantity will be the STAMP
       positioning objective. CONUS units, including ARC units, will not requisition these
       quantities.

          14.2.4.4.1. The GACP will ensure CONUS base excess over the 30-percent CONUS
          base positioning objective is realigned to meet STAMP positioning objectives.
          14.2.4.4.2. The GACP in coordination with AFMC/A4MW develops UTC according
          to AFI 10-401 to support STAMP outload of these assets.
          14.2.4.4.3. CONUS and OCONUS excess and shortages will be satisfied through the
          GAP and MMP processes.
          14.2.4.4.4. CONUS units will include the 45-percent OCONUS pre-positioned and
          the 25 percent STAMP positioned quantities ‘as available’ for SORTS reporting.
   14.2.5. Requirements for ejector carts must be factored into the forecast.
   14.2.6. Requirements of air-to-ground munitions for aircrew and ground crew training are
   determined IAW AFI 11-212. ACC/A3TW, HQ AFMC, and HQ AFSOC submit RAP
   requirements to the GACP and AF/A5R-C annually.
   14.2.7. The NAF forecasts for OCONUS CAT Code T requirements and the Lead
   MAJCOM forecasts for CONUS CAT Code T requirements. Lead Commands coordinate
   with Supported Commands during development of CONUS CAT Code T requirements
   forecasts.
   14.2.8. AF/A5R-C, AFSFC/SFXW, and AFCESA/CEXD co-chair and the GACP hosts the
   Requirements Working Group. Air Staff reviews and discusses forecast data with MAJCOM
   and NAF MUFMs, adjusts as necessary, before approving worldwide munitions
   requirements.
      14.2.8.1. MAJCOM and NAF MUFMs provide requirements forecast changes with
      adjustments/rationale at the conclusion of the requirements review.
      14.2.8.2. Any disputes regarding changes made to the forecast will be sent to AF/A5R-C,
      AFSFC/SFXW, and AFCESA/CEXD. The Air Staff will resolve any open issues and
      validate final munitions requirements changes.
14.3. Munitions Allocation Process. AF/A5R-C, AF/A4LW, AFSFC/SFXW, and
AFCESA/CEXD co-chair and the GACP hosts the Munitions Allocation Working Group. The
 240                            AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


allocation working group is used to match limited worldwide inventory against validated
requirements (derived from the requirements working group). Munitions beddown plans are
validated against asset allocations and necessary adjustments are made. The following should be
considered: Substitute munitions and items when the primary munitions are unavailable (while
substitutes may satisfy one or more functions, it might not necessarily perform satisfactorily in
all instances); issues that impact deployments, ANG, AFRC, and training; available
infrastructure; and new or revised mission changes to include BRAC announcements.
   14.3.1. The GACP will release an Air Staff coordinated agenda for the allocation working
   group. Air Staff will provide the parameters for stockpile optimization for inclusion with the
   agenda.
       14.3.1.1. Ten duty days before the allocation working group, the GACP will provide the
       MAJCOM and NAF MUFMs with information relative to inventory availability and
       other issues.
       14.3.1.2. Attendees will be limited to those activities invited by the allocation working
       group memorandum (typically, the host, co-chairs, a MAJCOM and NAF representative
       from the A4 munitions staff (or equivalent).
   14.3.2. The Allocation Working Group:
       14.3.2.1. AF/A5R-C, AFSFC/SFXW, and AFCESA/CEXD decide the priority order of
       build for stockpile optimization. Stockpile optimization is the process of merging the
       available inventory with the priority build list to achieve a supportability position. At the
       beginning of the allocation working group, these activities will brief the prioritization
       methodology.
       14.3.2.2. AF/A5R-C, AFSFC/SFXW, and AFCESA/CEXD decide allocations.
       14.3.2.3. MAJCOM and NAF representatives will observe, advocate interests, and
       support other MAJCOMs.
   14.3.3. The GACP records the allocation decisions in the Initial DLAR and provides it to
   the MAJCOM and NAF A4 munitions staffs, AF/A5R-C, AFSFC/SFXW, and
   AFCESA/CEXD NLT two weeks after the working group.
   14.3.4. MAJCOMs and NAFs will use an initial DLAR to prepare prior to the GAP working
   group convening.
   14.3.5. A final DLAR is published NLT 30 calendar days following the GAP working group
   convening. MAJCOM and NAF munitions staffs will facilitate the allocation process by
   assisting the MAJCOM MUFMs. MUFMs will finalize theater/command positioning
   decisions in AMST prior to the MMP GAP working group convening.
   14.3.6. For tenant units, The MAJCOM MUFM sends using NAF theater allocations to the
   host MAJCOM/NAF theater providing munitions support. Host MAJCOM/NAF theaters
   cannot change allocations for tenant units. MAJCOMs/NAFs must notify the GACP of any
   host/user allocation transfers.
14.4. Allocation Increase or Addition Requests. Request for allocation increases or additions
will be prepared and coordinated IAW paragraph 7.5.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                              241


14.5. Buy-Budget Process. The munitions Buy-Budget Review (BBR) addresses procurement
of conventional ground, air-to-ground, EOD munitions, small arms, and associated equipment
(excluding missiles). The procurement of SOF unique MFP-11 conventional ground, air-to-
ground, small arms and associated equipment is conducted by USSOCOM. Procurement of
these items is part of the overall DoD Programming, Planning and Execution (PPBE) system.
   14.5.1. The GACP hosts and AF/A5R-C, AF/A5XS, and AF/AQXR co-chair the BBR in
   April to facilitate preparation of Budget Estimate Submission (BES) / Program Budget
   Review (PBR) justification documentation for Procurement of Ammunition, Air Force
   (Appropriation 3011), Munitions and Related Equipment (Budget Program 3500).
      14.5.1.1. Prior to the BBR, the GACP and other affected AFMC product centers will
      prepare a Buy Book of budget exhibits and provide an advance copy to assist BBR co-
      chairs and HQ AFCESA/CEXD in determining munitions and associated equipment
      funding priorities.
      14.5.1.2. During the BBR:
          14.5.1.2.1. The GACP will present procurement recommendations based on
          forecasted requirements, inventory analysis, prior procurement action and industrial
          production capabilities.
          14.5.1.2.2. AF/AQXR will analyze procurement data and recommend the best use of
          funds.
          14.5.1.2.3. Program Element Monitors (PEMs) will establish the final funding
          priorities based on all information provided.
      14.5.1.3. After the BBR:
          14.5.1.3.1. The GACP will prepare and distribute formal minutes of the proceedings
          and ship buy books and other classified materials requested to BBR participants.
          14.5.1.3.2. AF/AQXR will issue specific guidance and instructions to the ALC and
          product centers for the BES in a budget call memorandum.
      14.5.1.4. All agencies responsible for P-series budget exhibits will submit documents to
      AF/AQXR based on funding priorities established at the BBR IAW the budget call
      memorandum.
      14.5.1.5. AF/AQXR will publish and distribute the final budget submission document.
14.6. Expenditure Reporting. Expenditure reporting is a critical data element of munitions
management processes at all levels (i.e., Unit, Base, NAF, MAJCOM, and Air Staff).
   14.6.1. Past expenditures help DoD determine allocation levels, develop buy-budget
   decisions, and defend procurement decisions to the Office of the Secretary of Defense,
   General Accounting Office (GAO), and Congress.
   14.6.2. Expenditure procedures are outlined in paragraph 7.18.

                                          Chapter 15

                          GLOBAL ASSET POSITIONING (GAP)

15.1. Program Scope. GAP integrates five munitions WRM positioning programs to meet
anticipated demands on time and resources. These provide theater commanders with their initial
starter stocks, provide rapid swing stock response capability with the APF and STAMP/STRAPP
and provides for operational swing-stock positioning by theaters and CONUS.
15.2. The Global Asset Positioning (GAP) Working Group: AF/A4LW sponsors and the
GACP hosts activity of the GAP working group and establishes positioning goals and objectives
for the Air Force, resolves issues of mutual concern and develops a munitions positioning
strategy for near- and mid-term munitions components for WRM, test, and training.
   15.2.1. System Program Office (SPO) participation is critical to acquisition support of GAP
   decisions. Production quantities and delivery dates must be published to AF/A5R-C, Lead
   Command, GACP and TMCP as necessary.
   15.2.2. This process identifies the following FY mandatory munitions movements. The
   annual MMP is produced as a result of decisions made by the GAP working group.
   Additionally, the working group validates beddown plans against movements and makes
   adjustments as necessary. The following are considered: APF, STAMP, Operational in-place
   theater stocks, CONUS stocks, test and training, delivery schedules of additional assets
   (legacy and new).
   15.2.3. Any deviation from the MMP requires a coordinated NAF/A4 and MAJCOM/A5
   request submitted through their unified command J-3 and J-4 to the Joint Staff J-3/J-4. Joint
   Staff J-3/J-4 will staff the deviation with AF/A4 and AF/A5 for approval. Joint Staff J-3/J-4
   will return the coordinated approval/response to the applicable MAJCOM/NAF.
   15.2.4. The GACP will consolidate, publish and track action items and lessons learned from
   each cycle. They will in turn provide status and related information to participants
   throughout the year and prior to the start of each working group.
15.3. Afloat Prepositioned Fleet (APF) Management.
   15.3.1. General: The AF APF prepositions forward-based munitions cargo in support of
   combatant commanders.
       15.3.1.1. The APF provides significantly greater deployment flexibility by reducing
       early lift requirements and allows for rapid movement ‘swing-stock’ of critical munitions
       assets from one region to another based on National Command Authority (NCA)
       priorities.
       15.3.1.2. The APF is manned and maintained by civilian mariner crews contracted
       through the Military Sealift Command (MSC). Vessels require permissive off loading
       with adequate terminal and port facilities, either afloat or ashore, to discharge explosive
       cargo. Supported MAJCOMs and NAFs must ensure host nation support to expedite
       cargo operations, minimize port congestion, and move the forward echelon out of the
       seaports.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                              243


     15.3.1.3. During APF configuration and load-out operations, except for Current
     Operations, APF has highest priority for munitions sourcing due to the limited window of
     availability.
  15.3.2. APF Contingency Discharge Operations:
     15.3.2.1. If an APF vessel is tasked for contingency discharge and apportioned to a
     theater, the APF Management Team will transfer accountability functions for APF cargo
     to the appropriate MAJCOM/NAF DoDAAC. The MAJCOM/NAF A4 munitions staff
     will process shipments in CAS to the ultimate consignee DoDAAC for each APF
     container planned for discharge.
     15.3.2.2. Prior to commencing discharge operations, the theater NAF must provide the
     APF Management Team with a theater distribution plan identifying the ultimate
     consignee DoDAAC for each APF munitions container to be discharged.
     15.3.2.3. The APF Management Team will deploy a Port Management Team(s) to the
     planned Sea Port of Debarkation (SPOD) to manage munitions offload sequence and
     priorities and ‘burn’ Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags with the ultimate
     consignee data and affix RFID tags to containers.
     15.3.2.4. After theater APF discharge and distribution operations are complete, the APF
     Management Team and the NAF A4 munitions staff will reconcile assets remaining on
     the NAF DoDAAC by matching those remaining on the APF vessel. Once reconciled,
     the APF Management Team in coordination with the NAF will transfer APF assets back
     to the APF vessel DoDAAC.
  15.3.3. APF Peacetime Discharge Operations:
     15.3.3.1. APF vessels may be planned for peacetime discharge to reposition specific
     munitions assets ashore in one or more theaters. During peacetime APF assets are not
     apportioned to the effected theater and the APF management team ships specific assets to
     the ultimate consignee DoDAAC.
     15.3.3.2. Peacetime discharge of selected APF assets is done only after coordination with
     AF/A4LW, AF/A5R-C, and the effected theater logistics/munitions planners.
     15.3.3.3. The APF management team may be tasked to deploy a Port Management
     Team(s) to coordinate munitions discharge and reconcile assets remaining on the APF
     vessel.
  15.3.4. APF Apportionment.
     15.3.4.1. During peacetime, apportioned APF assets are under the operational control of
     the Theater Commander in whose area of responsibility the ships are located.
     15.3.4.2. For contingency and crisis action planning, the JSCP apportions the APF as
     forces. As apportioned in the JSCP, one or more vessels may be tasked in OPLAN Time-
     Phased Force and Deployment Lists (TPFDL).
        15.3.4.2.1. Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD) research must
        consider ship stowage plans, port unloading times, and the time to move assets from
        one theater to another. Also consider assets available through other means such as
        CONUS or forward-based swing stocks, and STAMP/ STRAPP. Approximate fleet-

          sail-times can be obtained from the GACP APF Management Team or APF
          Battlebooks.
          15.3.4.2.2. The unified command’s air component submits TPFDD requirements to
          the theater commander. The theater commander validates the requirements during the
          execution-planning phase for later entry into the theater commander’s validated
          TPFDD. Deployment planning should allow for flexibility as the preplanned
          priorities sometime change in execution.
          15.3.4.2.3. During execution, actual commitment of the APF to theater commanders
          will be IAW Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) established priorities. Once the vessel is
          chopped to the theater commander, he or she decides how to best utilize the afloat
          assets by determining the offload strategy to meet mission needs. Theater
          commanders may address requests for reallocation of assets to the CJCS to be
          handled through the JMPAB. Final authority to divert APF vessels requires NCA
          approval. The JMPAB decides user priority if more than one OPLAN is executed
          simultaneously.

   15.4.6. HQ ACC/A4RX: Posts the approved WCDO to the Air Force Weapons
   Requirements Community of Practice (CoP) located on SIPRNET for the 649 MUNS and
   184 MUNS.
15.5. Theater-Prepositioned and CONUS-Stored Assets. Theater prepositioned assets,
although an integral part of GAP, are managed by owning theater commanders in consideration
of applicable Air Force positioning guidance. CONUS stored assets can be in any one of three
categories:
   15.5.1. Retail stocks assigned to CONUS base accounts.
   15.5.2. Retail stocks at AFMC depots or facilities (i.e., STAMP).
   15.5.3. Wholesale stocks at Army ammunition plants and depots. The SMCA manages these
   Army depots. Most Air Force CONUS-stored assets are at these SMCA-managed locations.
15.6. Munitions Transportation Funding, PACER AMMO. PACER AMMO is the official
DoD nickname for the centralized funding process identifying the transportation requirements to
meet MAJCOM munitions positioning objectives.
   15.6.1. HQ AFMC/A4MW coordinates with the MAJCOM (CONUS) and NAF (OCONUS)
   munitions staffs and is responsible for monitoring and tracking the transportation funding
   process for all AF munitions movements. This includes CONUS PHIT, and OCONUS sea
   and air costs. OCONUS PHIT surface (truck/rail) movements are not paid by PACER
   AMMO project codes.
   15.6.2. The NCAA provides munitions requirements while the TAMP and DLAR provide
   allocations and positioning objectives.
       15.6.2.1. MAJCOMs (CONUS) and NAFs (OCONUS) determine which munitions to
       request for call forward and retrograde based on their allocations and theater operational
       plans.
       15.6.2.2. Positioning objectives are determined by the TAMP and GAP working groups
       based on MAJCOM (CONUS) and NAF (OCONUS) desires and Air Force objectives as
       determined by Air Staff.
       15.6.2.3. The MMP developed during the GAP working group will provide the basis for
       forecasting and allocating SDT funding to move munitions.
       15.6.2.4. Each of the moves in the MMP not categorized as a ‘Must Pay’ will be
       prioritized by the GAP steering committee, co-chaired by AF/A4LW and AF/A5R-C.
   15.6.3. DELETED.
       15.6.3.1. Transportation funding requirements must be identified and resources allocated
       to support munitions movements from point of origin to final destination within the
       CONUS and to the OCONUS port of entry.
       15.6.3.2. PACER AMMO will provide the focus to justify and advocate funding to
       preposition the worldwide munitions stockpile IAW the GAP and MMP.
       15.6.3.3. The MMP will be costed out by AFMC and used as the basis for the SDT
       requirement submission for munitions moves within the Air Force. When SDT funds are
       released, the MAJCOMs will be notified of approved MMP moves.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                               253


  15.6.4. The types of munitions movements, definitions, project codes and categories are in
  Table 7.4.
     15.6.4.1. Programmed movements are categorized as ‘Must Pay’ or ‘Prioritized’.
         15.6.4.1.1. ‘Must Pay’ movements are mandatory and critical to the daily operations
         and are authorized when requisitioned.
         15.6.4.1.2. ‘Prioritized’ moves are funded to the maximum extent possible within
         available resources.
     15.6.4.2. ‘Approval Required’ category is for moves not identified at the GAP. These
     require AF/A5R-C approval. Once approved, these movements fall into ‘must pay’ or
     ‘prioritized’ categories.
     15.6.4.3. The official project codes listed in Table 7.4 must be included on all shipment
     documents.

planning will specify the exact meaning of C-day within the aforementioned definition. The
command or headquarters directly responsible for the execution of the operation, if other than the
one coordinating the planning, will do so in light of the meaning specified by the highest
command or headquarters coordinating the planning
Capability Production Document (CPD)—A document that addresses the production elements
specific to a single increment of an acquisition program. The CPD must be validated and

amphibious assault, air or naval bombardment. The highest command or headquarters
coordinating the planning will specify the exact meaning of H-hour within the aforementioned
definition. Normally, the letter "H" will be the only one used to denote the above. However,
when several operations or phases of an operation are being conducted in the same area on D-
day, and confusion may arise through the use of the same hour designation for two or more of
them, any letter of the alphabet may be used except A, C, D, E, J, M or others that may be

fiscal years approved forces. The NCAA is an analytical process designed to quantitatively
identify the most effective mix of conventional air munitions to be programmed for procurement
and maintained in the worldwide WRM stockpile. Documents the calculations, assumptions and
methodologies used to computing conventional air munitions theater requirements. Identifies by
MAJCOM totals, the near-term primary munitions requirements and out year planning levels.
Theaters threat models, WMP-5 sorties, theater expenditure per sortie factors (EPSF), and safety
factors all influence munitions computations. NCAA CTRs are used throughout the planning/
programming process to aid in identifying how each type item should be positioned to achieve
Air Force objectives. The NCAA is published by AF/A5R-C and distributed to MAJCOMs, and
other designated agencies. AFSOC’s SOF unique (MFP-11) and Air Force common munitions
WRM requirements are established by USSOCOM using the Joint Mission Analysis (JMA)
system. The JMA generated requirements are provided to AF/A5R-C and merged into the
NCAA.
Notional Tasking—A procedure to facilitate planning among all the services, commands, and
agencies whereby operation plan forces are expressed as standard type units as described in the
type unit data file disseminated by the Joint Staff, no specific units are identified.

subassemblies (containing no fissionable or fusionable material) identified by the Military
Departments (MILDEPs) that comprise or could comprise a standardized war reserve nuclear
weapon (including equivalent training devices) as it would exist once separated/removed from its
intended delivery vehicle.
Numbered Air Force (NAF)—A level of command directly under a MAJCOM. NAFs are
tactical echelons that provide operational leadership and supervision. They are not management
headquarters and do not have complete functional staffs. Many NAFs are responsible for
MAJCOM operations in a specific geographic region or theater of operations.
Operation Order (OPORD)—A directive issued by a commander to subordinate commanders
for the purpose of effecting the coordinated execution of an operation.

response to actual and potential contingencies. 2. In the context of joint operation planning level
4 planning detail, a complete and detailed joint plan containing a full description of the concept
of operations, all annexes applicable to the plan, and a time phased force and deployment data. It
identifies the specific forces, functional support, and resources required to execute the plan and
provide closure estimates for their flow into the theater. Also called OPLAN. See also operation
order. (JP 5-0)
Peacetime Conventional Ammunition Requirements (PCAR)—The annual process initiated
by the GACP to have units identify and reference munitions requirements in Categories A, B, C,
D, E, F, N, and T used to support Aircrew Training, Test, Ground Forces, and EOD.
Planning Factor—A multiplier used in planning to estimate the amount and type of effort
involved in a contemplated operation. Planning factors are often expressed as rates, ratios or

   A3.4.4. If automated- or remote-input is not utilized, use direct-input to update CAS
   inventory with results from count sheets upon receipt. Account for all inventory sheets (if
   used) and ensure all associated CAS records are reconciled.
   A3.4.5. Notify the MASO of discrepancies found by inventory count teams.
   A3.4.6. Compile inventory package upon completion of the inventory, to include all
   documented discrepancies and provide to the MASO. The following shall be included in the
   inventory package:
       A3.4.6.1. Inventory Accuracy Report (if applicable).
       A3.4.6.2. Count Sheets (if used).
       A3.4.6.3. Discrepancy memorandum.
       A3.4.6.4. Certificate of Transfer (if required).
       A3.4.6.5. All locally produced documents used during the inventory.
A3.5. Inventory Procedures:
   A3.5.1. Utilize CAS inventory procedures and system generated products.
   A3.5.2. Stockpile and Complete Round inventories may be run simultaneously. The MASO
   must ensure both inventories have all required documentation and are filed in the same
   inventory package.
   A3.5.3. Stockpile inventory will be accomplished IAW paragraph 7.11
   A3.5.4. Complete Round Inventory: To minimize interruption to flightline operations, the
   MASO may direct the Complete Round inventory be selected in CAS after the physical count
   of assets has been accomplished. The Complete Round Build-Up Report
   (AM249A)/Complete Round Record List (AM250A) may be used to accomplish this count.
   A3.5.5. Print CAS count sheets (if used) and provide to count team(s)/team chief(s).
   A3.5.6. All assets in structures must be accounted for. If using automated-, direct-, or
   remote-input; or a CAS generated count sheet, and assets in the structure are not reflected in
   CAS or on the count sheet, the discrepancy must be documented on a count sheet. The
   following data must be recorded:
       A3.5.6.1. NSN.
       A3.5.6.2. Lot Number.
       A3.5.6.3. CC.
       A3.5.6.4. Quantity.
       A3.5.6.5. Location.
   A3.5.7. Inventory discrepancies will be resolved using procedures in paragraph 7.11.8.10.
   A3.5.8. If a physical recount is required, inventory recounts will be conducted by an
   alternate count team.
   A3.5.9. The inventory reconciler will update CAS upon return of the inventory count sheets
   (if used). If inventory count discrepancies exist, the reconciler will re-enter the quantities
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                               289


  from the count sheets that pertain to each specific discrepancy. If inventory count
  discrepancies still exist, the reconciler will generate inventory recount listings.
  A3.5.10. Sealed Structure Inventory Procedures. The MASO verifies the inventory when
  initially storing munitions in sealed structures, to include intermodal containers. After the
  inventory, the MASO (or designated representative) will apply serial-numbered seals to the
  doors of structures.
     A3.5.10.1. If CAS generated or manual count sheets are used, record the Structure
     Number, Seal Number, and the Date seal was applied. If automated-, direct-, or remote-
     input is used, record this information on a memo. The MASO validates this information
     by signing the count sheet or memo.
     A3.5.10.2. Sealed structures need not be inventoried again until the structure seals are
     broken for any reason. It is at the discretion of the on-coming MASO if structures with
     validated unbroken seals will be inventoried.
         A3.5.10.2.1. DELETED.
         A3.5.10.2.2. DELETED.
         A3.5.10.2.3. DELETED.
     A3.5.10.3. Retain documentation until next physical inventory is performed.
     A3.5.10.4. The MASO should consider that the August 10% inventory may have a
     significantly greater number of NSNs to inventory because it is the last month in the 10%
     inventory cycle and CAS will selected all assets for inventory that have not received a
     previous 10%
  A3.5.11. Change of MASO Inventory:
     A3.5.11.1. If discrepancies exist after the first count, conduct a recount to include a
     check of the following areas:
         A3.5.11.1.1. The inspection/maintenance bay.
         A3.5.11.1.2. The transportation holding area (if applicable).
         A3.5.11.1.3. The ADR/unserviceable bay.
         A3.5.11.1.4. Courtesy storage areas.
         A3.5.11.1.5. Any other applicable holding/storage areas not noted above.
         A3.5.11.1.6. If discrepancies still exist after performing the above actions, a second
         recount will be conducted with the addition of verifying ‘LITE’ box contents.
         A3.5.11.1.7. If discrepancies exist after the second recount, perform the following
         procedures:
             A3.5.11.1.7.1. Process a transaction history on the affected NSN back to the Date
             o Last Inventory (DOLI).
             A3.5.11.1.7.2. Collect all documents currently out of file and movement control
             forms for affected NSN/lot number.
             A3.5.11.1.7.3. Compare source/input documentation against all transactions
290                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


             reflected on the transaction history beginning from the DOLI.
             A3.5.11.1.7.4. Compare all movement control forms against transaction history.
             A3.5.11.1.7.5. Research all custody accounts with the same NSN.
             A3.5.11.1.7.6. Verify assets are not pending transportation.
             A3.5.11.1.7.7. If the discrepancy still can’t be resolved, the MASO must initiate
             inventory adjustment procedures.
  A3.5.12. Quarterly Custodian Inventory:
      A3.5.12.1. When organization is scheduled to conduct the Quarterly Custodian
      Inventory, the MASO generates the inventory in CAS.
      A3.5.12.2. Provide custodian conducting inventory with the CAS generated count sheets.
      A3.5.12.3. Custodians return count sheets in accordance with the MASO suspense to
      ensure the inventory is reconciled in CAS within 30 calendar days of date inventory was
      generated.
      A3.5.12.4. MASO reconciles inventory in CAS and generates a new Custody Account
      Listing (AM507A) which has an updated DOLI reflecting the inventory was conducted
      and reconciled. The Custody Account Listing (AM507A) will be placed in the inventory
      package and routed to the Commander for signature.

 MUNITIONS FUNCTIONAL AREA TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES
  (TTP) FOR OPERATIONS IN A CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL,
       NUCLEAR, HIGH YIELD EXPLOSIVES (CBRNE) ENVIRONMENT

A5.1. Overview:
   A5.1.1. This attachment provides a Munitions Functional Area TTP IAW AFMAN 10-2503,
   to enhance ATSO for Munitions operations and activities in CBRNE environment. This TTP
   includes contamination avoidance procedures to employ throughout the munitions production
   and delivery process and integrates contamination avoidance considerations into the use of
   munitions assets and personnel, long term identification of contaminated munitions assets,
   decontamination of munitions assets, and the handling of contaminated waste. Munitions
   organizations must be able to achieve ATSO and execute effective contamination avoidance
   procedures and/or performing munitions operations in a contaminated environment.
   A5.1.2. Munitions organizations and managers are involved in the development and
   implementation of the Munitions portion of the installation Comprehensive Emergency
   Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2 and associated checklists for specific CBRNE response
   actions when directed by local/higher authority. Refer to AFI 21-101, Chapter 14 for
   applicable references, this attachment, and AFMAN 10-2503 when developing the Munitions
   portions of the installation CEMP 10-2 and specific checklists.
A5.2. Contamination Avoidance Measures: Munitions activities are directly linked to sortie
generation. They involve multiple resources such as weapons, trailers, tow vehicles, and
weapons load trucks. The use or non-use of contamination avoidance measures within the
munitions area has a tremendous ripple effect on other areas of the flight line, with a
corresponding influence on sortie production capabilities. For example, if bomb bodies become
contaminated, this will require additional time for personnel to either decontaminate the bombs
or transition to Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) 4 for the entire production and
delivery process. The contaminated weapons would potentially degrade the effectiveness of the
entire production operation and environment, munitions storage area, weapons load point,
aircraft shelter areas, and end of runway (EOR) stations. For this reason, it is imperative that
munitions personnel use effective contamination avoidance techniques throughout the entire
process; from pulling the munitions components out of the storage, through the production
process, and to the point the weapons aircraft loading and arming.
A5.3. Geographically Separated Munitions Storage Sites:
   A5.3.1. In many cases, munitions operations occur at geographically separated sites outside
   the main perimeter of the base/installation. These sites generally contain critical stocks of
   munitions production components to provide an initial munitions capability to support the
   mission. It is critical that these remote sites and the personnel are working in concert with
   and part of the overall airbase active and passive defense hierarchy and processes. These
   units should accomplish the following items to ensure these sites and personnel have
   sufficient protection from the effects of chemical and biological weapons.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                295


      A5.3.1.1. Transfer munitions materials and supporting resources to the main
      base/installation at the earliest possible time, within the constraints of safe and secure
      storage capacity and net explosive weight (NEW) restrictions.
      A5.3.1.2. Integrate the remote munitions location/site into the airbase attack warning and
      reporting system with as many redundant methods as feasible to include the installation
      siren and giant voice system, the commander’s TV channel, radio (both military and
      radio station), and telephone lines to Munitions Control and/or Unit Control Center
      (UCC).
      A5.3.1.3. Depending on the distance from the airbase, key installation and munitions
      leadership, in conjunction with Civil Engineer Readiness, must establish rules of
      engagement (ROE) for remote site personnel. The remote site should have fixed or
      expedient shelters and bunkers for personnel, munitions, and the transport trailers and
      vehicles. Overhead covers and at a minimum the capability to employ expedient
      hardening should be a key component of this IRP protective scheme for remote munitions
      sites. The provision of overhead cover is important in that the entire munitions
      production and delivery process may need to be performed in MOPP 4 configuration for
      extended periods if the munitions components are contaminated prior to delivery to the
      production or loading sites.
      A5.3.1.4. Installation security forces and munitions personnel must consider, develop,
      and execute plans for security to protect remote munitions sites and delivery routes from
      attack. Civil Engineer Readiness personnel must plan to set up a CBRNE detection
      systems at geographically separated munitions site to include the use of pre-positioned
      M8 paper and the employment of automated detectors. Civil Engineer Readiness and the
      base/installation munitions managers must plan for and ensure the remote munitions site
      in included in installation post-attack reconnaissance plans, both in terms of on-site
      procedures and through aggressive monitoring by the installation Nuclear, Biological,
      and Chemical (NBC) Defense Cell. This should also include provisions for specialized
      post-attack reconnaissance team support as necessary.
      A5.3.1.5. The rapid absorption characteristics of chemical agents guarantee that, for
      decontamination operations to be beneficial, remote site personnel must initiate
      decontamination activity shortly after the onset of contamination since there will not be
      time for off-site personnel to arrive and conduct decontamination operations. At a
      minimum, remote munitions site personnel must possess an immediate decontamination
      capability for themselves to include:
         A5.3.1.5.1. M291 and M295 decontamination kits.
         A5.3.1.5.2. Glove and boot decontamination troughs with 5 percent chlorine
         solutions.
         A5.3.1.5.3. M295 decontamination kits for operational decontamination of munitions
         and vehicles.
A5.4. Protecting Critical Resources from Contamination throughout the Munitions
Process:
296                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


 A5.4.1. Due to the different stages and resources used in the Munitions Operational Flow
 Process (Refer to Figure 7.1) an integrated contamination avoidance techniques are required
 for the effort to be successful. Whenever possible, ensure that munitions trailers are provided
 with overhead cover. Use fixed facilities or the provision of barrier materials to protect the
 exposed munitions and equipment surfaces to include the trailer tongues and attaching
 hardware (i.e., rail extenders, trolleys, chocks, and extensions). If you must choose between
 protecting the trailer’s surface and protecting the tongue, protect the trailer surface. This will
 help to avoid transference of chemical contamination on the trailer surface to the munitions
 immediately after chemical agent deposition. It is difficult to decontaminate a trailer’s
 surface due to uneven metal grating, cracks/crevices, tie-down points and hardware.
 Conversely, the trailer tongue is relatively easy to decontaminate with an M295
 decontamination kit and it does not represent an operationally significant contamination
 transfer hazard. If using barrier materials, if possible, cover the sides of the munitions
 trailers as well, so the undercarriage is protected.
 A5.4.2. In most cases, forklifts are used to break-out components from the storage facilities
 or areas. Storage areas should provide overhead cover if possible to prevent contamination
 from spreading to other areas and negatively affecting the entire operational process.
 Contamination avoidance measures must also extend to the protection of the break-out
 forklift/equipment and ensuring that storage facility doors are immediately closed during
 attack situations. If space exists, temporarily position forklifts/ equipment into the storage
 facility/under overhead protection and turn them off during an attack.
  A5.4.3. If feasible, and when possible, set up two or more production sites and separate them
  by the greatest possible distance to assure ability to continue operations and assure proper
  quantity-distance (QD). This provides for concurrent operations to expedite production
  operations and provides greater redundancy id a production site becomes contaminated and
  unusable. If possible, provide overhead cover for each production operation, or enclose them
  entirely. Chemical agent absorption and hazard durations on various surfaces will impact site
  operations. Bomb production site floors should remain unpainted because chemical agents
  are rapidly absorbed into bare concrete; which will reduce the contact hazard much more
  rapidly. If production site floors must be coated, use latex based paint. Avoid the use of
  AM-2 matting or other impervious floor materials as extended residual hazards will persist if
  liquid contamination occurs.
  A5.4.4. In CBRNE threat environments, only break-out munitions components from storage
  areas for production just before their assembly is required. Effective coordination and
  scheduling of break-out and production activities can minimize the amount of time munitions
  and components are exposed to potential contamination; and maximize the time they are
  under overhead protection. Depending on the time it takes to transport munitions from
  storage areas to the production sites, it may not be cost effective from a manpower point of
  view to cover trailers, however, cover trailers and the munitions components if they routinely
  spend more than 1 hour outside an enclosed storage/production area.
  A5.4.5. After munitions are assembled and loaded onto munitions trailers, they must be
  provided overhead protection/cover as quickly as possible or placed back into covered
  storage areas on trailers/dunnage. If the flight line munitions staging areas, slips, delivery
  points employ continuous overhead cover (For example: HAS/PAS, facility, large tent/tarp
  covering several trailers spots), it may not be cost effective to cover loaded trailers during
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  297


   transport from production to flight line staging areas/delivery points. If trailers do not have
   existing flight line overhead cover, trailers should be covered before delivering them to the
   flightline. Depending on the flying schedule/Air Tasking Order (ATO) munitions may be on
   the flightline for extended periods of time before aircraft loading occurs. It is crucial to
   protect the trailers and munitions during this extended time to avoid contamination and
   seriously degrade the positive effects of previous contamination avoidance measures.
   A5.4.6. If munitions become contaminated while in the storage area, accomplish munitions
   delivery and weapons loading in MOPP 4, even if the aircraft parking area and other
   resources (fuel trucks and weapons load trucks) are uncontaminated. If dealing with
   individual contaminated munitions trailer/loads in the flight line munitions staging areas, the
   delivery crew/weapons load crew should remove the barrier material, and dispose of it as
   contaminated waste before transporting the load to the aircraft parking/loading area.
   However, if positioning the munitions without overhead cover for more than 1 hour at or in
   the immediate vicinity of the aircraft parking/loading area, the delivery crew/weapons load
   crew should replace the barrier material over the munitions trailer or munitions.
   A5.4.7. If munitions trailers had overhead cover/protection using a method other than
   covering with barrier material, the delivery crew/weapons load crew should not transport the
   loaded munitions trailer from the flight line munitions staging area until just before aircraft
   loading begins. If positioning the munitions without overhead cover for more than 1 hour at
   or in the immediate vicinity of the aircraft parking/loading area, the weapons load crew
   should ensure that the munitions trailer is protected with barrier material/other cover. Once
   removing the munitions from the trailer at the aircraft parking/loading area, provide the
   munitions trailer with overhead cover as soon as possible. This will avoid the potential for
   contamination of the empty trailer and increase personal safety for personnel who must
   recover and reconfigure/reload the trailer upon return to the munitions area and ensures the
   next munitions production and delivery cycle can be completed in an uncontaminated
   environment.
A5.5. Integrating Contamination Avoidance Considerations into the Use of Assets and
Personnel:
   A5.5.1. Munitions personnel should protect all assets using overhead cover, dispersal, and
   expedient hardening and only employ those resources that are required and necessary at any
   given time; this decreases overall exposure of munitions, equipment, and personnel. This
   concept of operations applies to both pre and post-attack scenarios. In addition to decreasing
   the likelihood of resource contamination, and the subsequent potential for cross-
   contamination, using less resources and limiting operations when possible reduces exposure
   and has a positive ripple effect for personnel protection.
   A5.5.2. Within the constraints of explosive Quantity-Distance (QD) and other safety factors,
   munitions UCC personnel and supervisors should aggressively plan to utilize trailers to their
   maximum possible capacity as opposed utilizing half loads. Unless mission essential
   activities absolutely require it, resist using (and exposing) multiple assets when less assets
   can be used. Avoid the temptation to employ multiple assets during the early stages of
   deployment or employment at a location that has pre-positioned equipment. In these
   situations, initial availability of assets may exceed requirements until the full TPFDD force
   arrival takes place.
298                           AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


  A5.5.3. When possible, depending on the ATO requirements, utilize larger capacity trailers
  when simultaneous munitions delivery at multiple locations is not required. This will limit
  the number of assets exposed to a potential/actual threat environment and can have a
  significant effect on sustainment operations where the intent is to only use uncontaminated
  resources.
  A5.5.4. Due to the inherent hazard in utilizing contaminated munitions and munitions
  equipment, munitions personnel must conspicuously identify all contaminated assets. Only
  use contaminated assets when uncontaminated assets of the same type are not available, and
  keep them separated from uncontaminated resources whenever possible. Contaminated
  munitions remain hazardous to unprotected personnel for extended periods. Since this can
  have a ripple effect on sortie production activities in otherwise uncontaminated areas,
  Munitions Control/UCC personnel should locate and use uncontaminated munitions to the
  maximum extent possible.
  A5.5.5. Munitions Control/UCC should exert positive control of the personnel in relation to
  completion of critical mission activities and control movement within and between
  contamination zones or sectors. The Munitions Control/UCC should maintain constant
  awareness of contamination status of each area associated with munitions operations,
  including remote sites, different functions/operations within the munitions areas, storage
  sites, flight line munitions staging areas, and the aircraft parking/loading areas. Munitions
  Control/UCC personnel should then determine the critical mission operations that must take
  place and limit movement and activity of personnel and equipment in those areas. The
  Munitions Control/UCC must provide detailed instructions and status updates to personnel
  who must transit multiple contamination zones or sectors.
  A5.5.6. If munitions areas become contaminated and the munitions production areas do not
  have overhead cover, Munitions Control/UCC personnel should assess operational
  requirements against available assembled munitions and only plan additional munitions
  production when absolutely necessary within the first few hours after an attack, when
  contamination avoidance is the most difficult to achieve. This technique will limit personnel
  exposure to contaminated environments, reduce the number of munitions that become
  contaminated during production, and eliminate/reduce the negative ripple effect that
  contaminated munitions will have on the overall sortie production process.
  A5.5.7. Supervisors and munitions work crews report their status to ensure personnel
  working at flight line munitions staging areas and in the Munitions Control/UCC are aware
  of the contamination status of the munitions being delivered between the munitions area and
  the flight line. Effective coordination and heightened personal awareness will enhance safety
  of personnel. Munitions production personnel must ensure delivery personnel and personnel
  at staging areas are aware of the contamination hazards associated with assembled munitions
  being delivered. Staging area personnel must ensure both munitions production personnel
  and weapons load crew personnel are aware of the contamination status of munitions and
  munitions equipment within the flight line staging area and weapons load crews must ensure
  staging area and production area personnel are aware of the contamination status of
  empty/loaded trailers returning from the flight line. Whenever possible, personnel should
  complete the munitions portion of the end-of-runway (EOR) process inside aircraft shelters
  or other protected areas.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  299


A5.6. Long Term Identification of Contaminated Munitions Assets:
   A5.6.1. The long-term identification of contaminated munitions assets is difficult since some
   assets are managed as Air Force vehicles (i.e., bobtails and forklifts) and others are managed
   as organizational equipment (i.e., weapons load trucks and munitions trailers). Initially,
   every item of contaminated ordnance needs not be individually marked. For example if an
   MHU-141 trailer load of AIM-9 missiles is contaminated, initially, it is sufficient to mark the
   overall trailer as contaminated rather than marking each missile. However, once munitions
   assets and trailers are separated each must be individually and conspicuously marked to
   ensure contamination avoidance and personnel are not exposed to unknown hazards.
   A5.6.2. Each person in the Munitions Operational Flow Process has the responsibility to
   conspicuously mark contaminated munitions assets and equipment. Initially, these marking
   will be temporary in nature, so assets may need to be remarked at periodic intervals to ensure
   temporary markings are no lost or obliterated and personnel can identify contaminated
   resources and avoid exposure to hazards. However, permanent contamination markings will
   be required for these assets in the long-term. Vehicle operators must also be instructed to
   annotate the interior portion of the AF Form 1800, Operator's Inspection Guide and Trouble
   Report at the same time they apply conspicuous external contamination markings on a
   vehicle. The operator should include the date and time of contamination, the type of agent,
   and the locations of the contamination.
   A5.6.3. Munitions personnel must relay the contamination status of equipment items to the
   Munitions Control/UCC. Personnel will do this by referencing the specific equipment item’s
   registration or S/N. Munitions Control/UCC personnel will update Section V of the
   equipment’s individual AFTO Form 244, Industrial, Support Equipment Record, with the
   date and time of contamination, the type of agent, and the locations of the contamination.
   There is no centralized tracking system to provide visibility for every item of contaminated
   munitions support equipment in the Air Force, therefore munitions personnel must ensure to
   accurately transcribe information regarding past NBC contamination whenever updating or
   re-accomplishing an AFTO Form 244. As soon as practical, vehicle operators should notify
   the Munitions Control/UCC of the contamination status of their vehicle and the Munitions
   Control/UCC will forward this information to the unit Vehicle Control Officer (VCO).
A5.7. Decontamination of Munitions Assets:
   A5.7.1. Munitions units/personnel are required to develop and maintain an installation level
   Munitions Contamination Control Team (CCT) capability to provide for expedient
   decontamination of munitions and munitions equipment within the Munitions Storage Area
   and Production areas. Because of limitations in decontamination technologies, key
   installation leadership and personnel must realize that, for decontamination operations to be
   beneficial, personnel and individual vehicle and equipment operators must operationally
   decontaminate the operational parts that will continuously be touched/handled within 1-hour
   from the time of contamination. Units may organize and equip CCT to support sustained
   operations. Each Munitions CCT team (normally two personnel) must assist unit personnel
   to develop and execute contamination avoidance and operational decontamination measures,
   to resupply the unit with decontaminants, and to collect and dispose of contaminated waste
   (see paragraph A5.4).
 300                            AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013


   A5.7.2. There is no need for extensive decontamination of each contaminated piece of
   ordnance, vehicle, or equipment item, as long as personnel clearly identify contaminated
   assets as containing a residual chemical hazard. Responsive operator’s and work center
   personnel’s accomplishment of operational decontamination using M295 decontamination
   kits are sufficient to continue mission operations. Decontamination operations will not
   produce significant results once the agent has absorbed into the paint or other absorbent
   surfaces. Depending on the surface, this absorption takes place in periods ranging from less
   than one minute up to approximately 1 hour. Regardless of the decontamination technique
   used, it is relatively easy to remove agents from the smooth panels before they absorb into
   the surface, but the chemical agents will tend to remain at low levels in crevices, rivet heads,
   and joints.
   A5.7.3. Consider the following when developing specific munitions decontamination
   operational procedures at the unit or individual level. Chemical or biological agents in dusty
   (small solid particle) form will not penetrate or adhere to surfaces in the same manner as
   agents in liquid form. While these agents will be relatively easy to remove with liquid
   solutions (5-percent chlorine bleach, soap and water), the threat from dusty agents is
   extremely limited and vehicle operators will probably not be able to detect the presence of
   these agents. There is no single machine, kit, team, technique, or procedure presently
   capable of fulfilling all decontamination requirements. The best chance of mitigating the
   effects of NBC contamination within the munitions area rests with the ability to accurately
   evaluate the situation, decide on an overall course of action, and direct individuals to
   accomplish a variety of avoidance and contamination control tasks based on their individual
   circumstances.
   A5.7.4. The majority of munitions assets on Air Force bases/installations use paint with
   polyurethane compounds. Chemical agents readily absorb into this type of paint. Thus,
   decontamination operations will not have a significant effect unless they take place within
   minutes after the time of contamination. Time itself equates to an effective decontamination
   technique to reduce the residual contact hazard. Impermeable surfaces like arming wires and
   other unpainted metal components do not allow agent penetration, therefore, these locations
   represent the most dangerous areas on contaminated assets.
   A5.7.5. Plastic and rubber components are porous materials and agents easily soak into these
   components. While the use of M295 decontamination kit or a 5-percent chlorine solution
   will effectively reduce or eliminate the operational contact hazard, the agent will remain
   imbedded in the material and varying degrees of vapor hazard will remain. There are no
   effective, operationally feasible methods for completely decontaminating canvas storage
   covers, webbing, and other textile materials contaminated with liquid chemical agents.
   Placing barrier materials over the item or item replacement are the best mitigation
   techniques.
A5.8. Handling of Contaminated Waste:
   A5.8.1. The effective handling and disposal of contaminated waste will require a major
   effort by munitions personnel, especially in the munitions storage and production areas. The
   act of unpacking munitions components will create large amounts of waste. Periodically,
   remove this waste from the unpacking area to a temporary or permanent waste disposal area
   in order for the munitions build process to continue. Munitions personnel must use forklifts,
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  301


  trailers, or other vehicles to transport these heavy assets. This compilation of multiple
  packaging and waste materials becomes a potential danger site for munitions personnel.
  Since there is no effective method of decontaminating many of the materials and absolutely
  no operational need to decontaminate, dispersed agents will absorb into the packaging
  materials and remain a contamination hazard until weathering effectively mitigates the
  hazards.
  A5.8.2. Contamination hazards will probably exist within and around the collection of
  contaminated waste for a longer period than the surrounding terrain and will require
  munitions personnel to be acutely aware of these residual hazards. When establishing their
  portion of the base/installation contaminated waste disposal program, munitions personnel
  should determine where their temporary waste disposal sites will be located. They must also
  determine the location of the permanent contaminated waste disposal site, the time or stock
  level for placing materials in the temporary waste disposal site, and the mechanism to
  transport the assets from the temporary to the permanent contaminated waste disposal site.
  The temporary waste disposal site should be at least 50 feet from occupied facilities or work
  positions if possible, and the permanent contaminated waste disposal site is normally a
  centralized function for the base/installation and its location is determined by the local Civil
  Engineer Readiness representative in the Survivability and Recoverability Center (SRC).
  A5.8.3. Utilize the NBC Marking Kit to cordon off or clearly identify any waste disposal
  sites contained within the munitions storage or production area and pre-position M8 paper
  around the temporary waste disposal sites. Assume contamination if the pre-positioned M8
  paper displays positive results. Ensure each work center within the munitions areas have
  contaminated waste disposal bins for small items such as contaminated M8 paper and used
  M295 decontamination kits, and develop the mechanism and procedures for delivering the
  contaminated waste from these locations to the installation’s contaminated waste disposal
  site. In addition, determine the contamination status of the vehicles that will be transporting
  munitions packing materials to the installation contaminated waste disposal site.
  A5.8.4. Additionally, to ascertaining if items have measurable amounts of contamination on
  their surface, also locate the pockets of contamination if possible. This may entail the use of
  a Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM) to pinpoint agents in liquid or dusty form housed in
  pockets of dirt and grease that M8 paper does not readily identify. If transport vehicles are
  uncontaminated, place plastic or other barrier material over the bed of the transport vehicle
  and dispose of the barrier material at the same time as the contaminated waste. At the end of
  each delivery cycle, check the vehicle for evidence of cross-contamination and take
  appropriate decontamination steps (normally the M295 decontamination kit). Mark the
  vehicle and the cargo to clearly identify the hazard associated with the contaminated cargo to
  personnel along the transportation route.

          AIR FORCE MUNITIONS DOCUMENT CONTROL PROCEDURES

A6.1. Introduction. These AFI 21-201 procedures implement Munitions Document Control
and electronic records and file management policy, assist units with management and control of
accountable munitions documents from initiation or receipt to final disposition, and to transition
to paperless environments. These procedures implement AFMAN 33-363, Management of
Records and maintenance of electronic records in accordance with the Air Force Electronic
Records Management (ERM) Solution located on the AF Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS) site.
A6.2. Document Control General Guidance.
   A6.2.1. Munitions documents and files shall be maintained electronically to include
   ‘MASO-certified’ true copies. Electronic documents must comply with the same intent that
   paper documents require to include levels of protection and security.
   A6.2.2. Munitions personnel will not make changes to the quantity, stock, lot, or document
   number on any accountable/auditable document (including electronic). The authorized
   custodian will initial any changes to paper documents or submit a new electronic document
   prior to processing in CAS. For receipt discrepancies identified during in-check refer to
   paragraph 7.15.1.1 and Table A6.1, Accountable Document Validation/Quality Control
   (QC) Matrix, Receipts, Note 7.
   A6.2.3. Munitions Supervision/MASO ensures that all CAS-generated receipt, issue,
   expenditure, turn-in request, inventory and adjustment documents produced or received that
   are associated with non-NWRM items are stamped/typed/printed electronically with
   “CLASSIFIED ITEM” in red, bold, capital letters on original and all copies. Stamp
   documentation associated with NWRM items with “NWRM CLASSIFIED ITEM” IAW AFI
   20-110. This alerts personnel to the fact that the assets they are handling/or documents are
   associated with classified assets, not that the documents are classified.
   A6.2.4. Local Document Flow Procedures. Munitions Supervision/MASO must ensure
   that document control and flow procedures are further defined in a local operating instruction
   (OI) to include:
       A6.2.4.1. Responsibilities and procedures for munitions work centers to process CAS
       transactions using automated-, direct-, and remote-input methods to achieve near-real
       time processing requirements.
       A6.2.4.2. Procedures for routing, sequence, and timelines for specific documents and
       maximum processing times at each operational node. Documents exceeding these
       timelines will be considered outstanding. All outstanding documents will be reviewed at
       the weekly scheduling meeting.
       A6.2.4.3. Procedures to ensure that all receipts, expenditure requests, and turn-in
       requests are routed to Document Control for filing within 10 duty days of processing.
       Procedures will also ensure that all issue documents are routed to Document Control for
       filing within 10 duty days after the custodian has signed for the assets.

   A6.8.1. The Munitions Document Control File Plan. The Chief of the Office Records
   (COR), Records Custodians (RCs), and Functional Area Records Manager (FARM) will
   establish an electronic file plan for the Munitions Document Control “Project File” within
   AFRIMS.
       A6.8.1.1. This file plan will not be combined with any other Munitions Accountability
       element or other unit file plans. The file plan will support the Munitions Document
       Control project file which will be used to maintain all accountable/auditable munitions
       records and supporting documentation. Follow the procedures below to create and
       configure the file plan:
       A6.8.1.2. The Munitions Document Control file plan will reside on Air Force approved
       media IAW the Air Force Electronic Records Management (ERM) Solution Using
       Existing Resources Guide. Use the ERM Solution Guide to control all accountable
       documents. The guide is available under ‘Helpful Links’ in AFRIMS (see AFMAN 33-
       363).
       A6.8.1.3. The FARM will establish a designated area within the unit ERM solution for
       the Munitions Document Control project file.
       A6.8.1.4. The FARM will ensure the project file is located in an area on your
       organizational network where authorized munitions personnel have read/view access to
       the files.
       A6.8.1.5. Contact the unit Information Assurance Officer (IAO) with names of the
       MASO (COR) and RCs along with their Common Access Card (CAC) ID numbers so the
       IAO can send a “Permissions Group Update” email to your MAJCOM Enterprise Service
       Desk (ESD) with the file locations server ID string to created/update the access
       permissions.
       A6.8.1.6. RCs will enter/configure the newly created file plan structure in AFRIMS
       using the examples outlined in paragraph A6.8.2.
       A6.8.1.7. RCs will create the Munitions Document Control project file in the designated
       area of the unit ERM solution as outlined in paragraphs A6.8.3 and A6.8.4.
       A6.8.1.8. RCs will transfer all existing Document Control electronic records to the
       appropriate folders within the Munitions Document Control project file and begin
       permanently filing new records within the file. Ensure records follow the naming
       conventions outlined in paragraph A6.8.5.
AFI21-201_SHEPPARDAFBSUPSUP 21 NOVEMBER 2013                                                      309


       A6.8.1.9. RCs will create disposition control labels from AFRIMS for records
       maintained within the Munitions Document Control project file as outlined in paragraph
       A6.8.6.
       A6.8.1.10. RCs will ensure all munitions records have a digital signature applied to
       preserve document integrity as outlined in paragraph A6.9.
       A6.8.1.11. RCs will maintain records in inactive status for the timeframe outlined in the
       applicable AF RDS Table and Rule.
       A6.8.1.12. RCs will maintain software and hardware capable of reading records
       throughout their lifecycle.
   A6.8.2. AFRIMS File Plan Configuration. Create a designated file plan within AFRIMS
   for the Munitions Document Control file. This file plan is separate from and will not be
   combined with the Munitions Accountability element or other unit file plans. Follow the
   below procedures to create the file plan and maintain records IAW the AF RDS table and
   rules within AFRIMS.
       A6.8.2.1. Create AFRIMS user accounts for the COR and RCs.
       A6.8.2.2. Assign Munitions Document Control file plan management privileges to the
       newly created COR and RC accounts.
       A6.8.2.3. Create Item 1 and Item 2 as shown in Figures A6.1, AFRIMS File Plan
       Configuration – Items 1 and 2 and Table A6.2, AFRIMS File Plan Configuration,

A6.9. Record Integrity and Preservation. Electronically filed munitions records will have
digital signature(s) applied to preserve document integrity. Personnel involved in the record
generation process may apply digital signatures during record generation. RCs and appointed
munitions document control personnel shall apply digital signatures during record filing or media
upgrade/conversion to preserve record integrity as necessary.
   A6.9.1. Media upgrade/conversion is authorized when technology obsolescence or
   operational constraints prevent digital signature revalidation in the existing format. RCs and
   munitions document control personnel will:
       A6.9.1.1. Ensure the existing digital signature(s) are valid prior to media conversion.
       A6.9.1.2. Ensure the printed name of electronic signer(s), as well as the date when the
       signature was executed, be included as part of any human readable form (such as
       electronic display or printout) of the converted media format.
       A6.9.1.3. Apply a digital signature to the upgraded/converted record certifying record
       integrity is preserved.
