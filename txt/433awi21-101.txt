This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and Space
Maintenance. It provides guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101 Aircraft and
Equipment and Maintenance Management. It establishes the 433d Airlift Wing aircrew
debriefing procedures and responsibilities. It applies to the 68th Airlift Squadron, 356th Airlift
Squadron, 433 Command Post and 433 Maintenance Group Squadrons. Refer to recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Records (OPR) using the
Air Force Information Management Tool (AF IMT) 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field to the appropriate functional’s change of
command. OPR has determined that no waivers may be granted for any part of the publication.
Ensure that all records created as a result of processed prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with to AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records and the disposal of
in accordance with Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rds.

1. Concept.
   1.1. Debrief is conducted at the termination of each sortie/mission or when a sortie/mission
   is aborted. Aircraft scheduled for turn-around sortie/mission need not be debriefed if returned
   in landing status Code 1 or 2. However, debriefing is required, regardless of landing status,
   after the last flight of the day for each aircrew. For Engine Run Crew Changes (ERCC’s), the
   departing aircrew will turn in Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781, (ARMS)
   Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, and AF IMT 4097, Aircraft Identification
   documents to the 433d Command Post.

    1.2. Aircraft debrief will be conducted by 433d Maintenance Operations
    Squadron/Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) personnel and the Aircraft Maintenance
    Squadron (AMXS) Production Superintendent and if applicable the Maintenance Squadron
    (MXS) Production Superintendent, Flightline Expediter, or qualified designated
    representative. The designated debriefing location will on the flight line in front of the
    aircraft, inside debrief vehicle.
    1.3. For aircraft returning during non duty hours, the aircrew will turn in Air Force
    Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781, (ARMS) Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, and
    AF IMT 4097, Aircraft Identification documents to the Command Post. Debrief personnel
    will retrieve documents the next duty day and review and load all discrepancies in the AFTO
    781A into the Graphical User Interface (GO81) data base, and if necessary call the aircrew
    for specific discrepancy information.
    1.4. Personnel assigned as debriefers will have a thorough knowledge of C-5A aircraft
    systems and possess a 5-level or higher primary Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)-2A5X1.
2. Responsibilities.
    2.1. Aircraft Commander. Aircraft Commander will:
       2.1.1. 30 minutes prior to landing, call the Command Post (433 AW/CP), to furnish
       advance aircraft status information and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). Using the
       standard maintenance codes in Table 1.1 to report landing status.
       2.1.2. Ensure that AF IMT 664, Aircraft Fuels Documentation Log envelope is removed
       from the 781 forms binder and placed in the AV FUEL in box located in the flight
       planning room after debrief.
    2.2. Command Post. Command Post personnel will:
       2.2.1. Notify MOC of Landing Status code; if aircraft returns CODE 2 or 3, specify
       discrepancy causing the condition.
       2.2.2. Inform MOC of aircraft status, ETA, and major discrepancies and request a
       parking spot.
       2.2.3. Inform aircraft commander of parking spot.
       2.2.4. Notify MOC if aircrews turned in any aircraft maintenance forms during non duty
       hours.

     2.3. Maintenance Operations Center (MOC). Debrief personnel will:
        2.3.1. Conduct aircrew debrief in front of aircraft inside debrief vehicle. At a minimum,
        the aircraft commander (pilot), flight engineer and other crewmembers as required will
        attend the debrief. When the debriefing is completed, aircrew are required to furnish
        AFTO Form 781 to the maintenance debriefing team chief and sign AMC IMT 278,
        Debriefing and Recovery Preplan and ensure accuracy of the AFTO FORM 781 H.
        2.3.2. Be responsible for the debriefing of the aircrew on all discrepancies on the AFTO
        FORM 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
        2.3.3. Query the aircrew to ensure that all symptoms of a malfunction that could lead to
        the proper diagnosis of the fault are known and recorded on the AMC Form 278, Debrief
        and Recovery Plan. C-5 Debrief Checklist AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment and
        Maintenance Management, AMCSUP CL-6, will be used to correctly identify
        discrepancies.
        2.3.4. Ensure all in-flight discrepancies entered on AFTO FORM 781A are complete and
        concise.
        2.3.5. Complete appropriate blocks on AMC IMT 278, Debriefing and Recovery
        Preplan. AFTO Form 781A aircrew discrepancies will be issued debrief job control
        numbers. The job control numbers will be transcribed to AMC IMT 278 Form, in the
        event that numerous entries are recorded the debrief representative will make a copy of
        all aircrew reported discrepancies and attach to the AMC IMT 278 prior to obtaining
        aircraft commander signature.
3. MOC/ DEBRIEF Post- Debrief Responsibilities.

       etc). A recurring discrepancy is when the same system/subsystem malfunction occurs on
       the 2nd thru 4th flights/attempted flights after the original flight in which the malfunction

       etc).
       3.1.2. Input all debrief discrepancies to include discrepancies discovered at other
       locations in to program 9050. When required a Basic Post Flight (BPO) package will be

       (MADAR) Personal Computer Memory Card (PC –III ) cards to the Analysis/G081
       office (433 Maintenance Operations Squadron Analysis (433 MOS/MXOOA) for
       processing. In the event of missing Madar PC-III cards, a debrief discrepancy will be
       initiated for the missing Madar (PC-III) cards.
4. Maintenance Personnel duties.
    4.1. The AMXS or MXS production superintendent or flight line expediter will attend
    aircrew debrief. The crew chief and aircraft specialists will attend when required.
