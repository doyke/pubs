                                             Chapter 1

                                    PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Randolph-Sheppard Act Program Overview. The blind have a priority right to operate
vending facilities on DoD-controlled property under the provision of the Randolph-Sheppard Act
when the opportunity to operate them becomes available. The priority extended allows blind
licensees to be gainfully employed while primary responsibility for carrying out this intent falls
upon the State Licensing Agency (SLA). It is nevertheless a responsibility of the installation
commander (the on-site official) to ensure that the operator is in fact a state licensed blind person
and that sighted employees or assistants are utilized only to the extent reasonably necessary.
1.2. When implementing the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Stand Act, priority on DoD-
controlled property will be extended to the blind as set out below:
     1.2.1. Establishing and operating vending facilities.
     1.2.2. Receiving contracts to operate cafeterias.
     1.2.3. In conjunction with acquisition or substantial alteration or property renovation,
     satisfactory sites shall be provided for blind vending facilities operation. A determination
     that a building contains a satisfactory site is presumed if the SLA and the on-site official
     consult and agree that the site or sites provided are satisfactory.
     1.2.4. Receiving a share of income from vending machines directly operated by or by
     contract by a DoD Component.
1.3. This priority will not be accorded when the on-site official determines, after conferring
with AFPC/SV, that the interests of the United States would be adversely affected if the
priority were accorded.
     1.3.1. The installation’s need to generate nonappropriated funds (NAFs) doesn’t alter the
     priority for the blind to operate vending facilities. This factor alone is not sufficient to
     support a determination that the interests of the United States would be adversely affected.
1.4. DoD Instruction 1125. 03 applies to Air Force installations and locations in:
     1.4.1. All 50 states.
     1.4.2. The District of Columbia.
     1.4.3. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
     1.4.4. Any territory or possession of the United States.
1.5. Responsibilities:
     1.5.1. The Director of Air Force Services (AF/A1S) serves as the head of the DoD
     Component and implements DoDI 1125.03 within the Department of the Air Force.
        1.5.1.1. Within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, AF/A1S shall forward to the
        Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (PDUSD
        (P&R)) the total number of applications for vending facility locations received from the
        SLAs; the number accepted; the number denied; the number still pending; the total
AFI34-206 7 AUGUST 2012                                                                       5


     amount of vending machine income collected and the amount of such vending machine
     income disbursed to the SLA in each state. These reporting requirements have been
     assigned Report Control Symbol DD-P&R (A)2210, according to DoD 8910.1-M,
     Department of Defense Procedures for Management of Information Requirements.
  1.5.2. AFPC/SV oversees and administers the program and is responsible for:
     1.5.2.1. Serving as the Administrator and the ―Approving Official‖ of the Air Force
     Randolph Sheppard Act Program, which approves or disapproves all blind vending
     permits. Permits are approved or disapproved subsequent to the Air Force Judge
     Advocate Field Support Center, Services Division (AF/JAA-S) legal review and
     AFPC/SV review.
     1.5.2.2. Coordinating actions on applications for vending facility permits and
     determinations concerning satisfactory sites with Army and Air Force Exchange Service
     (AAFES), as appropriate, when the designated sites may negatively affect the sales and
     patronage of AAFES activities.
  1.5.3. The installation commander is the ―On-site Official‖ for the purposes of this
  instruction. For Air Force locations without installation commanders, the senior individual in
  command of the location serves as the ―On-site Official.‖
  1.5.4. The Force Support Squadron (FSS) Commander/Director provides staff support
  relating to this instruction at the installation.
  1.5.5. Blind vending permits shall be issued in the name of the SLA.
 6                                                                    AFI34-206 7 AUGUST 2012


                                             Chapter 2

                 PROGRAM GUIDELINES FOR VENDING OPERATIONS

2.1. Vending Operations Reporting Contact. Immediately report any contact by non-DoD
sources with any Air Force installation concerning requests for or questions about the program’s
benefits or entitlements to AFPC/SV. (Exception: Routine contractor communications
regarding appropriated fund (APF) or NAF actions). Provide AFPC/SV concurrent installation
information reports.
     2.1.1. Air Force Civilian Welfare Fund (AFCWF) for contacts affecting nonappropriated
     fund instrumentalities (NAFI) subject to AFCWF jurisdiction.
     2.1.2. AAFES for contacts affecting AAFES activities.
     2.1.3. Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Acquisition, Contracting for contacts affecting
     appropriated fund activities.
2.2. Take no action on such contacts without specific guidance and authorization from
AFPC/SV. This requirement applies to all such contacts with activities on Air Force
installations, including those with AAFES activities.
2.3. The Air Force honors the priority for the blind to establish and operate vending
facilities (other than cafeterias):
     2.3.1. On the request of the SLA for the blind whenever a vending facility is initially
     established.
     2.3.2. When a FSS Services activity terminates its direct or contracted operation of an
     existing vending facility for which there is a continuous need.
     2.3.3. Any acquired (purchased, rented, leased, constructed), or substantially altered or
     renovated building is required to have one or more satisfactory sites (see Attachment 1,
     Terms) for a blind-operated vending facility, except as provided in paragraph 2.3.3.2
        2.3.3.1. A determination that a building contains a satisfactory site, or sites is, presumed
        made if the SLA and the ―On-site Official‖ consult and agree that the site or sites
        provided are satisfactory.
            2.3.3.1.1. The installation will notify the appropriate SLA by certified or registered
            mail, return receipt requested, of buildings to be acquired or substantially altered or
            renovated. This notification will be provided at least 60 days in advance of the
            intended acquisition date or the initiation of actual construction, alteration or
            renovation. As a practical matter, the SLA will be contacted as early as possible in
            the project planning or design stage (see Attachment 3). (This notice requirement
            does not apply in cases as described in paragraph 2.3.3.1.1.3). The notification will:
                2.3.3.1.1.1. Indicate that a satisfactory site or sites for the location and operation
                of a blind vending facility is included in the plans for the building.
                2.3.3.1.1.2. Forward a copy of a single line drawing indicating the proposed
                location of such a site or sites.
                2.3.3.1.1.3. Assure the SLA that, subject to the approval of the installation
AFI34-206 7 AUGUST 2012                                                                           7


              involved, it will be offered the opportunity to select the location and type of
              vending facility to be operated by a blind vendor prior to completion of the final
              building space layout.
              2.3.3.1.1.4. Advise the SLA of their requirement to respond within 30 days
              acknowledging receipt of the correspondence from the installation and indicating
              whether it is interested in establishing a vending facility, and if interested,
              indicating its agreement or alternate selection of a location and its selection of the
              type of vending facility. A copy of the written notice to the SLA and the SLA’s
              response, if any, will be provided to the Secretary, Health, Education and Welfare
              through AFPC/SV.
          2.3.3.1.2. If the SLA responds that it does not desire to establish and operate a
          vending facility and sets forth any specific basis other than the insufficiency of
          persons to support a vending facility, or if the SLA does not respond within 30 days,
          then a site meeting the anticipated needs of the installation will be incorporated into
          the building plan. Each such site shall have a minimum of 250 square feet for sale of
          items and for storage of articles necessary for the operation of a vending facility.
          2.3.3.1.3. If the SLA indicates that the number of persons using the property is, or
          will be, insufficient to support a vending facility, then a satisfactory site to be
          operated under the auspices of the SLA shall not be incorporated. The ―On-site
          Official‖ shall, through AFPC/SV, notify the Secretary, Health, Education and
          Welfare of the SLA’s response.
      2.3.3.2. The requirement to provide a satisfactory site does not apply:
          2.3.3.2.1. When fewer than 100 Federal employees will be located in the building
          during normal working hours; or
          2.3.3.2.2. When the building contains less than 15,000 square feet to be used for
          Federal Government purposes and the Federal Government space is used to provide
          services to the general public.
   2.3.4. The provisions above do not preclude arrangements under which vending facilities to
   be operated by blind vendors may be established in buildings of a size or with an employee
   population less than specified. For example, if a building is to be constructed that will only
   contain 30 Federal employees, upon agreement of the ―On-site Official‖ and the SLA, the
   ―On-site Official‖ may determine to provide a satisfactory site in which the blind agreed to
   operate a vending facility.
   2.3.5. When an Air Force organization is leasing all or part of a privately owned building in
   which the lessor or any of its tenants have an existing restaurant or other food facility in part
   of the building not covered by the lease, and operation of a vending facility would be in
   substantial direct competition with such restaurant or other food operation, the requirement to
   provide a satisfactory site does not apply.
2.4. The ―On-site Official‖ provides AFPC/SV with immediate notification of any
complaint filed by the SLA or FSS Services activity. Provide concurrent notice to the
AFPC/SV, and to the AAFES, as appropriate. This paragraph does not apply to disputes that
 8                                                                    AFI34-206 7 AUGUST 2012


arise under any APF or NAF contracts. Process such disputes under the disputes procedures
prescribed in the applicable contracts.
2.5. The ―On-site Official‖ submits all correspondence concerning determinations that US
interests would be adversely affected directly to AFPC/SV. Provide information copies to
AAFES (paragraph 2.1.2), where appropriate.
2.6. Send all applications for permit to AFPC/SV. Send information copies to AAFES, where
appropriate.
     2.6.1. See Attachment 2 for a sample permit to use in processing SLA applications. Do not
     change the format, with the following exceptions:
        2.6.1.1. Add the variable local information, e.g., type, location, and size of facility,
        operating hours, etc.
        2.6.1.2. List types of articles sold such as newspapers in attachment C to the permit. The
        SLA determines what items and services the vending facility will stock after consulting
        with the ―On-site Official.‖ Articles sold at such vending facilities may consist of
        newspapers, periodicals, publications, confections, tobacco products, foods, beverages,
        chances for any lottery authorized by the State law and conducted by an agency of a State
        within such State, and articles or services traditionally found in blind-operated vending
        facilities operated under Section 107 of Title 20, United States Code, as determined by
        the SLA, in consultation with the on-site official, to be suitable for a particular location.
        Articles and services may be automatically or manually dispensed.
2.7. The permit will be issued for an indefinite period of time subject to suspension or
termination upon failure to comply with agreed upon terms; and cases of (a) inactivation of the
installation or activity, (b) loss of use of a building or other facility housing the vending facility,
or (c) change in Air Force’s requirements for service, or (d) inability of the SLA to continue to
operate the vending facility
2.8. The permit will provide that:
     2.8.1. No charge will be made by the Air Force to the SLA for normal repair and
     maintenance of the building, or for cleaning areas adjacent to the designated vending facility
     boundaries, or for trash removal from a designated collection point.
     2.8.2. The SLA is responsible for cleaning and maintaining the appearance of, and for the
     security of, the vending facility within designated boundaries of such facility and for all costs
     of any kind in conjunction with vending facility equipment, merchandise and other products
     to be sold. Installation, modification, relocation, removal, and renovation of vending
     facilities are subject to the prior approval of the ―On-site Official‖ and the SLA. Costs of
     installation, modification, removal, relocation, or renovation will be paid by the initiating
     party. Neither party will be responsible for loss or damage to the other’s property, unless
     proximately caused by its acts of omissions. The SLA is also responsible for the acts of
     omission of the blind vendor, his employees or agents.
     2.8.3. Vending facilities will be operated in compliance with applicable health, sanitation
     and building codes, ordinances and regulations.
     2.8.4. The permit will also contain appropriate requirements for reimbursement to direct
     payment for support services such as utilities and telephone services.
AFI34-206 7 AUGUST 2012                                                                            9


   2.8.5. In the event the blind licensee fails to provide satisfactory service or otherwise fails to
   comply with the requirements of the permit issued to the SLA, the ―On-site Official‖ will,
   after coordinating with AFPC/SV, notify the SLA of this deficiency in writing and request
   corrective action within a specified reasonable time. The notice will indicate that failure to
   correct the deficiency will result in temporary suspension or termination of the permit, as
   appropriate. AFPC/SV will recommend suspension or termination action after legal review
   and coordination through AFPC Services Director, AF/JAA-S, AF/A1S, and the office of the
   Principle Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (PDUSD(P&R)).
2.9. Vending machine income (as defined in Attachment 1) generated by the installation
will be shared with the SLAs for the blind and/or blind vendors. The determination of
whether a vending machine is in direct competition with the blind-operated vending facility is
the responsibility of the ―On-site Official‖ subject to the concurrence of the SLA. The vending
machine income-sharing requirements are as follows:
   2.9.1. One hundred percent (100%) of the vending machine income from vending machines
   in direct competition with blind-operated vending facilities will be provided to the SLA.
   2.9.2. Fifty percent (50%) of the vending machine income from vending machines not in
   direct competition with blind-operated vending facilities will be provided to the SLA.
   2.9.3. Thirty percent (30%) of the vending machine income from vending machines not in
   direct competition with blind-operated vending facilities, and located where at least 50
   percent of the total hours worked on the premises occur during other than normal working
   hours, will be provided to the SLA.
2.9.4. All direct costs are deducted from gross income prior to calculating shared income.
2.10. Vending machine income-sharing requirements do not apply to:
   2.10.1. Income from vending machines operated by, or for, the military exchanges.
   2.10.2. Income from vending machines, not in direct competition with a blind-operated
   vending facility, at any individual location, installation, or facility where the total of the
   vending machine income from all such machines at such location, installation, or facility
   does not exceed $3,000 (per building) per fiscal year.
2.11. The payment to SLAs under these income-sharing requirements must be made
quarterly on a fiscal year basis.

                      PROGRAM GUIDELINES FOR CAFETERIAS

3.1. Program Guidelines for Cafeterias. The blind have priority in the award of contracts to
operate cafeterias (see definition Attachment 1) on DoD-controlled property (does not apply to
full food services, mess attendant services or services supporting the operation of a military
dining facility (DoDI 1125.03, Paragraph 1.d.)) as follows:
   3.1.1. Direct negotiations may be undertaken with the SLA for award of a contract on a sole-
   source basis whenever the ―On-site Official,‖ with concurrence of AFPC/SV, determines that
   the SLA, through its blind licensee, can provide the cafeteria services required at a
   reasonable cost, with food of high quality comparable to that available from other providers
   of cafeteria services. In the event direct negotiations fail to result in a contract with the SLA,
   the procedures in paragraph 5.2. will be followed.
3.2. When contracting for the operation of a cafeteria on a competitive basis the procuring
activity shall issue a copy of the solicitation to the appropriate SLA. The solicitation, when
issued, will establish basic requirements and criteria for evaluating proposals. The criteria upon
which proposals are evaluated shall be the same for all competitive sources (including any
responding SLA) and may include factors such as sanitation practices, personnel, staffing, menu
pricing and portion size, variety, budget and accounting practices, fees and other relevant
considerations.
   3.2.1. If the SLA submits a proposal that is not within the competitive range established by
   the contracting officer, award may be made to another offeror following normal procurement
   procedures, but only after the ―On-site Official‖ confers with AFPC/SV.
   3.2.2. If the SLA submits a proposal that is within the competitive range established by the
   contracting officer, the contract will be awarded to the SLA except as follows:
       3.2.2.1. The contracting officer may award to other than the SLA when the ―On-site
       Official‖ determines that the award to the SLA would adversely affect the interests of the
       United States and the Secretary, U.S. Department of Education, approves the
       determination (processing must be fully justified in writing through AFPC/SV), or when
       the ―On-site Official‖ determines, after conferring with AFPC/SV, and the Secretary,
       U.S. Department of Education, agrees, that the blind vendor does not have the capacity to
       operate a cafeteria/dining facility in such a manner as to provide food service at a
       comparable cost and of comparable high quality as that available from other providers of
       cafeteria services.
AFI34-206 7 AUGUST 2012                                                                    11



3.3. The operation of a cafeteria by a blind vendor will be governed by contractual
agreement, not by a permit. 3.4 All contracts for the operation of cafeterias with other than
SLAs will, upon expiration, be processed under the above paragraphs unless the SLA informs the
―On-site Official‖ that it is declining to assert its priority at that time.

Blind Licensee— A blind person licensed by the SLA to operate a vending facility on DoD-
controlled property.
Cafeteria— A food dispensing facility that provides a broad variety of prepared foods and
beverages (including hot meals) primarily through the use of a line where the customer serves
himself or herself from displayed selections. A cafeteria may be fully automatic, or some limited
waiter or waitress service may be available and provided within the cafeteria, and table or booth
seating facilities are always provided. The DoD Component food dispensing facilities that
conduct cafeteria-type operations during part of their normal operating day and full table-service
operations during the remainder of their normal operating day are not ‖cafeterias‖ if they engage
primarily in full table-service operations.
Direct Competition— The presence and operation of a DoD Component vending machine or a
vending facility on the same DoD-controlled property as a vending facility operated by a blind
vendor. Vending machines or vending facilities operated in areas serving employees, the
majority of whom normally do not have access (in terms of uninterrupted ease of approach and
the amount of time required to patronize the vending facility) to the vending facility operated by
a blind vendor, will not be considered to be in direct competition with the vending facility
operated by a blind vendor.

located in close proximity to each other and between which a majority of the Federal employees
working in such buildings regularly move from one building to another in the normal course of
their official business during a normal working day.
Federal Employees— Civilian APF and NAF employees of the United States.
License— A written instrument issued by a State Licensing agency to a blind person,
authorizing that person to operate a vending facility on DoD-controlled property.

SLA agree that a smaller facility is appropriate.
State— A state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, a territory, or
possession of the United States.
State Licensing Agency— The State agency designated by the U.S. Department of Education to
issue licenses to blind persons for the operation of vending facilities on Federal and other

Substantial Alteration or Renovation— A permanent material change in the floor area of a
building that would render it appropriate for the location and operation of a vending facility by a
blind vendor.
Vending Facility— Automatic vending machines, cafeterias, snack bars, cart service, shelters,
counters, and such other appropriate auxiliary equipment that may be operated by blind licensees
and that are necessary for the sale of newspapers, periodicals, confections, tobacco products,
foods, beverages, and other articles and services to be dispensed automatically or manually and
that are prepared on or off the premises according to applicable health laws. Also includes
facilities providing the vending or exchange of chances for any lottery authorized by State law
and conducted by an agency of a State within such State.
Vending Machine— For the purposes of assigning vending machine income, a coin- or
currency-operated machine that dispenses articles or services, except those machines operated by
the United States Postal Service for the sale of postage stamps or other postal products and
services, machines providing services of a recreational nature (e.g., juke boxes, pinball machines,
electronic game machines, pool tables, shuffle boards, etc.) and telephones, shall not be
considered as vending machines.
Vending Machine Income— DoD Component receipts from DoD Component vending machine
operations on DoD-controlled property, where the machines are operated by any DoD

1. Both parties must comply with 34 CFR 395.16. The Air Force issues this permit for an
indefinite period of time subject to suspension or termination on the basis of noncompliance by
either party with any of the agreed upon terms and conditions of the permit. By mutual
agreement, the state licensing agency (SLA) and the property agency or owner may terminate the

removing trash from a designated collection point.

3. The SLA is responsible for cleaning, maintenance, and security of the vending facility and for
all costs relating to vending facility equipment, merchandise, and other commercial products,
except as provided in paragraph 6. Neither party is responsible for loss or damage to the other’s
property unless proximately caused by acts or omissions. The SLA is also responsible for acts or
omission of the blind vendor and his or her employees or agents.

4. Vendors must operate facilities in compliance with applicable health, sanitation, and building
codes, ordinances and regulations.

5. The ―On-site Official‖ and the SLA must approve all vending-facility projects, including
installation, modification, relocation, removal and renovation. The initiating party shall pay the
costs of installation, modification, relocation, removal, or renovation. If officials suspend or
terminate a permit because of noncompliance, the non-complying party bears all costs for
removing vending machines from the building.

6. The (AF installation) provides utility support and bills the state licensing agency. The SLA
must pay no later than 30 days after receiving the bill.

7. This permit is issued for an indefinite period of time, subject to these suspension and
termination stipulations:

a. Permits are suspended or terminated when any party fails to comply with agreed upon terms
after notice to the other party or when any party fails to correct non-complying performance.

b. Permits are terminated upon receipt of 60 days written notice when the Air Force closes an
installation or activity or changes its requirements for services; when the building that contains
the vending site can no longer be used for that purpose; or when the SLA can no longer continue
to operate the vending facility.

MEMORANDUM FOR (State Licensing Agency)

FROM:

SUBJECT: Randolph-Sheppard Act Amendments – ACTION MEMORANDUM

1. In accordance with Randolph-Sheppard Act as amended, enclosed is a line drawing of a
building (to be constructed) (designated for substantial alteration or renovation) (to be acquired)
at ______________________________________. The Air Force has designated a general –
purpose satisfactory site for the blind-operated vending facility, which is identified on the
drawing. Installation officials consider this location to be most conveniently accessible to the
majority of the ________ Federal employees projected to work in the facility. If you decide that
this number is sufficient to support a vending facility, please indicate your concurrence or your
counter-proposal, and a description of the type of vending facility to be operated. If you don’t
consider this site satisfactory and subject to Air Force approval, you will have the opportunity to
select the location and type of vending facility to be operated before the final space layout of the
building is complete. If you decide that you aren’t prepared to establish such a facility in this
building for operation by a blind licensee, or if it is not your intention to establish a vending
facility at this time, please let me know.

2. In the event you don’t respond within 30 days of receiving this letter or don’t provide an
explanation for your decision not to establish a vending facility, I will assume you have
determined that the number of employees using this building is or will be insufficient to support
such a facility.

SUBJECT: Randolph-Sheppard Act Amendments – ACTION MEMORANDUM

1. Reference my letter of _________________, regarding the Randolph-Sheppard Act. I
forwarded the (State Licensing Agency) a line drawing of a building (to be constructed)
(designated for substantial alteration or renovation) (to be acquired) at
_____________________________. The drawing incorporated a proposed site for a blind-
operated vending facility. A copy of this correspondence was furnished concurrently to your
office.

2. I have been notified by the State Licensing Agency that is does not desire a site for a blind-
operated vending stand to be provided, as per their attached letter. Accordingly, and unless
otherwise directed by the Secretary of Education, a satisfactory site for a blind-operated vending
facility will not be incorporated in the final plans.
