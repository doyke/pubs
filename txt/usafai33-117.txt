1. USAFA Vulnerability Management Program. The DoD Information Assurance
Vulnerability Management (IAVM) Program is an enterprise-wide program to address security
of information systems supporting the academic mission. The goals of the DoD IAVM Program
are to identify & mitigate network vulnerabilities posing threats to DoD systems and
information, improve Configuration Management and provide situational awareness across the
Global Information Grid. The USAFA Vulnerability Management Program Policy describes the
roles and responsibilities of organizations and personnel required to comply with, track and
report vulnerability mitigation. The following are the organizational roles and responsibilities

DISA—In addition to other services offered, DISA develops and provides security configuration
guidance for IA and IA-enabled IT products. The guidelines are outlined in DISA's STIG, which
identify existing and potential vulnerabilities on a system. STIGS exist for a variety of operating
systems and applications. Within each STIG, DISA defines four vulnerability codes from CAT I
(high vulnerability) to CAT IV (low vulnerability):
CAT I—Vulnerabilities that allow an attacker immediate access into a machine, allow super user
access, or bypass a firewall.
CAT II—Vulnerabilities that provide information that has a high potential of giving access to an
intruder.
CAT III—Vulnerabilities that provide information that potentially could lead to compromise.
CAT IV—Vulnerabilities that provide information that will lead to the possibility of degraded
security.
USCYBERCOM—Plans, coordinates, integrates, synchronizes, and conducts activities to:
direct the operations and defense of specified DoD information networks and; prepare to, and
when directed, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in
all domains, ensure US/Allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our
adversaries. The USCYBERCOM manages the DoD IAVM program and issues IAVAs to
provide computer application software or operating system vulnerability notification in the form
of alerts, bulletins, and technical advisories.
24th Air Force—The operational warfighting organization that establishes, operates, maintains
and defends Air Force networks and conducts full-spectrum operations in cyberspace. The 24th
Air Force provides full-spectrum management and defense for AF Network Operations through
the 67th Network Warfare Wing, the 690th NSG.
USAFAI33-117 8 JANUARY 2013                                                               11


561 Network Operation Squadron—Operates one of two INOSCs for 690 NSG. The INOSC
is the CNDSP for Air Force Information Systems including, but not limited to NIPRNet and
SIPRNet.
IAVA A (Alert)—An IAVA A is a vulnerability defined as severe, having potential to critically
impact DoD systems and information. The IAVA As require acknowledgement and compliance
responses, and a Plan of Action and Milestones (POAM) is required for noncompliance.
IAVA B (Bulletin)—An IAVA B is a vulnerability which does not pose an immediate risk to
DoD systems, but is significant enough that noncompliance without corrective action could
escalate the risk. The IAVA Bs require acknowledgement response. The HPC sites must be in
compliance with IAVA B notices.
IAVA T (Technical Advisory)—An IAVA T advises that a vulnerability exists but is generally
categorized as low risk. No acknowledgement or compliance response is required.
