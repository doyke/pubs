This pamphlet series is intended as a load planning guide and provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners (both long range and individual
movement) to load plan aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Equipment and methods
listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed. It must be noted that,
unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary widely,
even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval, therefore, ultimately rests with the
individual contractor providing airlift services to the DOD. This pamphlet series enables
application of DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation – Part III Mobility, Appendix
V, Aircraft Load Planning and Documentation; as well as AMCI 10-402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet
(CRAF). The guidance contained herein is applicable to all USAF, AFRC, ANG and DOD
agencies whenever they are charged with using the CRAF assets contained herein, in accordance
with DOD, inter-service, and/or MAJCOM agreements.

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This pamphlet series is non-directive in nature. It provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners to more efficiently and effectively
load plan aircraft in the CRAF.

1.2. Scope. CRAF aircraft specifications listed herein are current as of the date of this printing.
Equipment and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed.
It must be noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not
standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval,
therefore, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DOD.
1.2.1. Volume 3, Boeing. AMCPAM 24-2 Volume 3 deals specifically with aircraft
manufactured by the Boeing Company. Boeing was first formed in 1916 as Pacific               Aero
Products Co, changing its name about a year later to the Boeing Airplane Co. Through several
mergers over the years (the last being with McDonnell Douglas Corp in 1997), the Boeing
Company has melded the companies founded by aerospace pioneers William Boeing, Donald
Douglas, James McDonnell, James "Dutch" Kindelberger, and Howard Hughes Jr. As of the date
of this publication, the Boeing Company has produced almost 17,000 commercial jet aircraft
alone, with over 12,100 still in service.

1.3. Arrangement. This pamphlet series is designed for easy reference and access to the most
commonly needed information for planning purposes. Essentially, Volume 1 will contain all
information common to the entire CRAF program and most, if not all, carriers. Volumes 2
through 5 will contain information specific to a particular manufacturer’s airframes, with each
sub-volume addendum addressing a different series or type. Each can be referenced separately
from another; however, each addendum needs to be used in conjunction with Volume 1.
1.3.1. Volume 3, Boeing Addenda. Volume 3 is not separated from each subsequent addendum,
but is published as a “cover” document along with and as an introduction for each addendum.
The same information for Volume 3 essentially gets republished--unchanged with each Boeing
model’s addendum.
1.3.2. Volume 3, Boeing Quick Reference Tables. All chapter descriptions for various models
are designed to be used in conjunction with Chapter 2 Quick Reference Tables. The information
in the Quick Reference Tables will generally not be restated in the expanded chapters as they are
meant primarily for pictorial figures.

1.4. Supplements. Changes or supplements to this pamphlet by agencies, other than AMC, are
prohibited. This does not preclude its use as a reference document for preparation of intra-
agency instructional directives.

1.5. Acronyms. An explanation of the acronyms used in this pamphlet is in AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 1, Attachment 1.

1.7. Description. Addendum A. Boeing B727 Series.
The B727 series aircraft is a narrow-body, short-to-medium range aircraft. Originally designed to
accommodate smaller airports with less developed facilities and shorter runways, the B727
incorporated several unique (for that time) designs. The major designs to note, for load planning
purposes, is the inclusion of an auxiliary power unit (APU), allowing independent electrical and
air-conditioning system support, the ability to back itself up, and one of the 727's most
distinctive features: the built-in airstair that opens from the rear underbelly of the fuselage.
(Many airlines sealed their airstairs entirely, after Dan "D.B." Cooper and Richard McCoy Jr.,
used the airstair inflight to escape by parachute after two separate hijackings in 1971-2).

The B727 series was the produced for over 22 years, with the last aircraft, a B727-200F,
delivered in September of 1984. Although Boeing only expected to make 250, by the end of its
run, 1,832 were built. As of 2008, an estimated 853 B727's (various models) are still in service.
According to Boeing, over 300 aircraft originally built as passenger plane have been converted
into freighter versions.

The B727-100 was the first in the B727 series. It first flew in February of 1963, and was type-
certified in December of the same year. It had the same fuselage width as the B707 (and the later
B737 and B757), it provided jet luxury on shorter routes. A total of 407 B727-100's were made.

The B727-100C was the next in the series, being type-certified in January of 1966. The "C"
designator stood for convertible, and featured a main-deck side cargo door, giving it the ability to
carry cargo pallets or passengers (or a combination of both) in the main compartment. Boeing
built 164 B727-100C's.

The B727-200 was introduced and type-certified in December 1967. It increased the length of
the fuselage 20 feet by the installation of two 10 foot plugs forward and aft of the wing. The
B727-200 also increased the overall gross weight and passenger capability. This was the most
popular model in the series, with 1,245 B-727-200's manufactured.

The B727-200F was the last variant in the series, and was approved for type-certification on
June 1983. The "F" or freighter version had an increased payload capacity, a main-deck side
cargo door, enabling the loading of cargo pallets in the main compartment. Fifteen of the B727-
200F's were originally built for Federal Express.

AMCPAM 24-2 Volume 3, Addendum A will focus primarily on the:

                               QUICK REFERENCE TABLES

2.1. Ranges. Most numbers are shown as a range, due to representing all-passenger to all-freight
versions OR due to different modifications within a series/type. Also, within a series, several
different engines/weight classes may exist.

2.2. Pallets. Unless otherwise noted, pallet information is based on the civilian pallet IATA code
PAG- / P1P- type LD7 which measures 88" × 125".

2.3. Table Legends.
2.3.1. Compartments. Unless otherwise noted, compartments are: M=Main/Upper;
F=Forward/Lower Lobe; A=Aft/Lower Lobe; B=Bulk/Lower Lobe.

2.3.2. “X”. An “X” represents the information does NOT apply for that series/type (ex: an all-
passenger version would have an “X” by Main Compartment Door)

2.3.3. Question Mark “?”. A “?” represents that the information should apply, but no
information exists in the manufacturer’s technical manuals.

2.3.4. Exclamation Point “!”. An “!” represents information that should apply, but has been
derived from a reliable, but non-manufacturer source.

2.4. After-Market Conversions. As a reminder, individual airlines may have converted an
airframe apart from the manufacturer’s original specifications. These tables and the charts in the
following chapters do not account for this.

2.5. Tables. The following tables (Tables 2.1 through 2.6) will vary with each AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 3 Addendum.

                                            3) All horizontal dimensions are measured left or right of aircraft centerline (CL).
                                            4) All vertical dimensions are measured from the top of the conveyor plane.
