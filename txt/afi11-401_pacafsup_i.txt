                                          Chapter 1

     RESPONSIBILITY AND OBLIGATIONS, FLIGHT AUTHORIZATIONS, AND
                      FOREIGN MILITARY FLYING

Section 1A—Responsibilities and Obligations

1.1. Overview. The policies and requirements of this instruction apply to all personnel who fly
onboard Air Force aircraft, and their commanders. In addition, it provides guidance on the Jump
Record Folder (JRF), Aviation Service Codes (ASC), and flight authorization (FA) codes in
Table A2.3 for Air Force parachutists. Further guidance on parachutist policies and requirements
can be found in AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute Operations.
1.1. (PACAF)Who Must Comply. This supplement applies to PACAF assigned and attached
aircrew and parachutists. It applies to Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), Air National Guard (ANG)
and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units when aircraft or aircrew are under the
operational control (OPCON) and/or tactical (TACON) control of PACAF or PACOM. This
supplement also applies to members of other commands, direct reporting units (DRUs), and field
operating agencies (FOA) (assigned and attached) when performing crew duties in PACAF
aircraft or when aircraft are under the operational control (OPCON) and/or tactical (TACON)
control of PACAF (ANG/AFRC). Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) offices
servicing tenant units will establish and review all host-tenant support agreements IAW AFI 11-
421, Aviation Resource Management annually.
1.2. Responsibilities of AF/A3O-A. The Director of Air Operations (AF/A3O-A):
   1.2.1. Through the DCS, Operations, Plans and Requirements (AF/A3/5), and the Director of
   Operations (AF/A3O), establishes and monitors the Air Force flying program as outlined in
   this instruction to ensure effective use of resources. Unless otherwise specified in this
   instruction, AF/A3O-A is the waiver authority for this instruction. (See paragraph 1.7 for
   waiver guidance.)
   1.2.2. Assigns AF/A3O-AT as the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for this
   instruction.
1.3. Responsibilities of MAJCOMs. (For purposes of this instruction, ANG is considered a
MAJCOM, except as provided otherwise.) MAJCOM/A3s will provide oversight of MAJCOM
flying programs. MAJCOMs will establish a system to carry out the requirements of this
instruction and meet training and operational needs of the Air Force.
1.3. (PACAF)The Chief, Operational Support Division, (HQ PACAF/A3T): has the
responsibility for administering the provisions of this basic instruction within PACAF, and
publishing the PACAF supplement.
   1.3.1. MAJCOM Commanders will prohibit any agency or unit from operating or
   maintaining an aircraft that does not have an established system program director. Waiver
   authority is MAJCOM/A3; coordinate waivers with MAJCOM/A4. Aircraft procured
   through non-DoD resources will not be flown or operated by USAF units without MAJCOM
   approval.
8                                                   AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


    1.3.2. MAJCOM Commanders may direct grounding of MDS-specific or all aircraft within
    their commands for maintenance reasons. When a MAJCOM has lead command aircraft
    responsibility, MAJCOM commanders may recommend grounding of all aircraft within an
    MDS-specific fleet. MAJCOM Commanders may also direct a stand-down of aircrew
    personnel when warranted by operational considerations, in conjunction with aircraft
    grounding or as a separate action. A stand-down has no immediate impact on the operational
    status of any unit aircraft; it is the result of an operational unit commander directing unit
    aircrews not to fly for a specific reason. A stand-down provides the commander time to
    assess an incident or finding and actions required to safely resume operations. Notification
    will be provided IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. See also AFI 21-101, Aircraft
    and Equipment Maintenance Management, for additional guidance. Return to normal
    operations will be initiated by the commander directing the original grounding/stand-down.
    Authority for grounding and/or stand-down may be delegated by MAJCOMs in supplements
    to this and other governing AFIs, but not lower than MAJCOM/A3/A4.
       1.3.2.1. The Director, Air National Guard (DANG), may ground United States Air Force
       aircraft assigned to the Air National Guard (ANG) and stand-down ANG aircrews. The
       DANG will coordinate any grounding or stand-down decisions with the Chief, National
       Guard Bureau. When the DANG exercises this authority to ground aircraft, the Secretary
       of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force will be notified as soon as
       practicable. No further delegation of this authority is authorized.
    1.3.3. Interfly Guidance. Lead MAJCOMs will place interfly guidance (if applicable) in AFI
    11-2MDS-Specific, Volumes 3. As required, establish additional interfly guidance in
    MAJCOM supplements to this AFI. Prior to the flight, ensure interfly agreements are
    approved and all unit coordination is complete. Ensure required information is provided to
    members Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) offices.
    1.3.3. (PACAF) For purposes of this supplement, interfly is defined as the exchange and/or
    substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft between operational units to accomplish
    flying missions. During contingencies, exercises, or designated missions, interfly operations
    will be conducted according to appropriate OPLAN or CONOPS. See the appropriate AFI
    11-2MDS (Mission Design Series) Specific, Vol 3 publications for interfly requirements.
    When not specifically established by AFI 11-2MDS-Specific, Volume 3, OG/CC is the
    approval authority for interfly on PACAF aircraft under their control. In all cases, interfly
    aircrew will be qualified in the MDS.
    1.3.4. Ensure no aircrew member is assigned Flying Status Code (FSC) S (Table 2.6)
    (except Duty Not Involving Flying [DNIF] members) or assigned ASC 04 (Table 2.5)
    beyond 180 days without being disqualified for aviation service, returned to flying/ground
    based radar duties, or reassigned to non-flying status/duty. MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent is
    the waiver authority for the 180-day limit. MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority to extend
    members in this status beyond 365 days. Send information copy to AF/A3O-AT for all cases
    waived beyond 365 days. Note: For members previously in DNIF status, the 180-day period
    begins on the date the member was cleared to perform flying duties.
    1.3.4. (PACAF) HQ PACAF/A3TC will review and staff ASC "04," and FSC "S" waiver
    requests to HQ PACAF/A3T or A3/5, as appropriate.
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                               9


   1.3.5. Ensure FSC K (Table 2.6) is used only for aircrew members assigned to an active
   Aircrew Position Indicator (API), but not authorized to fly due to lack of resources (aircraft,
   flying hours, etc.). To ensure the requirement for active flying is still valid, each position
   occupied by a member assigned FSC K must be revalidated by the MAJCOM/A3 at the end
   of each fiscal year. The member’s commander will submit a request for revalidation through
   group channels for MAJCOM/A3 approval. Upon completion of the revalidation, send
   notification to the member’s Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) office
   authorizing the continuance of FSC K. Send an information copy to AF/A3O-AT. See
   paragraph 1.4.1.9 for additional guidance. EXCEPTION: MAJCOM/A3 revalidation is not
   required for FSC K assigned to members deployed to a non-flying assignment.
   1.3.5. (PACAF) HQ PACAF/A3TC will staff FSC “K” revalidation requests to
   PACAF/A3/5, and will notify member’s HARM office and AF/A3O-AT of PACAF/A3/5
   approval/disapproval. Staff revalidation requests to arrive at PACAF/A3T NLT 30
   September of each year.
       1.3.5.1. FSC K is not authorized when aircrew members are double billeted due to
       permanent change of station (PCS) or permanent change of assignment (PCA) actions.
   1.3.6. Review all cases when a rated officer with longer than 18 years of aviation service and
   assigned to an active flying position, or a CEA with longer than 20 years of aviation service
   and assigned to an active flying position, has not flown for 180 days and is not in suspension,
   disqualification, or DNIF status. Review will determine whether the member should be
   disqualified from aviation service, reassigned to an inactive flying position, or returned to
   flying. Note: For members previously in DNIF status or assigned ASC 04, the 180-day
   period begins on the date the member was cleared to perform flying duties.
   1.3.7. The serving HARM office will monitor double billeting management IAW paragraph
   1.4.2.1 and provide a monthly report to the applicable MAJCOM/A3T. The MAJCOM/A3T
   will facilitate waiver request or aviation management actions with the servicing HARM
   office.
   1.3.7. (PACAF) The designated HARM office will notify and advise commanders of all
   API 5, 6, 8, B, and D coded positions with more than one rated or CEA assigned. Monthly
   reports are due to PACAF/A3TC NLT the 10th of each month.
   1.3.8. IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, MAJCOMs supplementing
   this AFI must rewrite, update (using an interim change [IC]), or certify supplements as
   current within 180 days of the publication of this AFI and whenever this AFI is updated
   (either by an IC or a rewrite). If the prior supplement conflicts with the current version of
   this AFI, the supplement must be immediately rescinded. Ensure subordinate organizations
   update supplements when higher headquarters publications are updated. See AFI 33-360 for
   specific guidance.
1.4. Responsibilities of Subordinate Organizations.
   1.4.1. Commanders are responsible for compliance with the requirements of this instruction.
   Commanders will:
       1.4.1.1. Issue orders and supervise all personnel assigned or attached to their command
       for flying duties.
10                                                AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


     1.4.1.2. Establish procedures to ensure all flights are reviewed for flight feasibility.
     Commanders may direct a stand-down of unit flying operations when warranted by
     maintenance, operational, or safety considerations. Provide notification IAW AFI 10-206,
     Operational Reporting.
     1.4.1.3. Ensure compliance with appropriate instructions, and adequate crew preparation
     for safe conduct of flight.
     1.4.1.4. Verify aircrew member qualification before assignment to an aircrew position.
     1.4.1.5. Notify the HARM office within 10 days of the beginning of any investigations
     that may affect an aircrew member’s aviation service (including Flying Evaluation
     Boards).
     1.4.1.6. Notify the MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent office when a rated officer with longer
     than 18 years of aviation service and assigned to an active flying position, or a CEA with
     longer than 20 years of aviation service and assigned to an active flying position, has not
     flown for 180 days and is not in suspension, disqualification, or DNIF status. Note: For
     members previously in DNIF status or assigned ASC 04, the 180-day period begins on
     the date the member was cleared to perform flying duties.
     1.4.1.6. (PACAF) When an incumbent assigned to an active staff flying position does
     not fly for 365 days, the flying justification on the AF Form 480, Aircrew AFSC/Active
     Flying Justification is invalidated and the MAJCOM will convert the position to an
     inactive API. If a commander requires a staff position without flight activity to remain
     active, submit a change request to HQ PACAF/A3T with justification that validates the
     continued need to keep the position active.
     1.4.1.7. Ensure aircrew members that have been disqualified for aviation service have
     the appropriate disqualification aeronautical order (AO) published, even if the member
     may have already separated or was dismissed from the Air Force. Every effort should be
     made to accomplish the disqualification action before the aircrew member is separated or
     dismissed.
     1.4.1.7. (PACAF) In cases where the member has separated, or has been dismissed from
     the Air Force, the HARM will follow guidance in AFI 11-421, Table 3.1., prior to
     forwarding (via First Class mail) the AO or FRF to the address listed on the member's
     separation orders. If all attempts fail, maintain FRF for 5 years then dispose IAW AFI
     11-421, Chapter 3.
     1.4.1.8. Ensure aircrew members assigned FSC S or assigned ASC 04 do not exceed 180
     days in this status without obtaining approval from the MAJCOM/A3T. If an extension is
     required, the member’s unit commander will submit the request for an extension/waiver
     prior to the 180-day limit. If a waiver of the 180-day limit was previously approved IAW
     paragraph 1.3.4, the member’s unit commander must again obtain waiver approval prior
     to the member exceeding 365 days in FSC S or ASC 04 status. AFI 11-402, Aviation and
     Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, provides applicable guidance for
     suspensions/disqualifications. See AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management, for
     additional guidance.
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                          11


     1.4.1.8. (PACAF) Commanders should coordinate closely with the servicing Host
     Aviation Resource Management (HARM) Chief, explore all options and be fully briefed
     on all ramifications prior to selecting a course of action concerning any rated aircrew
     member or career enlisted aviator (CEA) who will exceed the 180-day limit for FSC “S”
     (except members in Duty Not Involving Flying [DNIF] status). If member is DNIF the
     180 day-count starts the day the member comes off DNIF status. Commanders will
     provide justification to the HARM office at the 150-day point explaining why the
     incumbent will remain in FSC “S” status beyond 180 days. The HARM office will
     forward request for extension complete with full justification, Attachment 13, to HQ
     PACAF/A3T, 25 E. ST SUITE G-317, JBPH-H, HI 96853-5426 prior to the expiration of
     the 180-day limit.
        1.4.1.8.1. (Added-PACAF) PACAF/A3 is the waiver authority to extend members
        in this status beyond 365 days. Commanders will provide justification to the HARM
        office at the 335 day point explaining why the incumbent will remain in FSC “S” or
        ASC 04 status beyond 365 days. Note: For members previously in DNIF status, the
        365-day period begins on the date the member was cleared to perform flying duties.
        1.4.1.8.2. (Added-PACAF) Forward recommendations to HQ PACAF/A3TC, 25 E.
        ST SUITE G-317, JBPH-H, HI 96853-5426. PACAF’s Aviation Resource Manager
        will staff the recommendations. All requests will be evaluated for determination as to
        the validity of converting or retaining the position.
        1.4.1.8.3. (Added-PACAF) Without an approved extension, the unit OG/CC (or
        equivalent) must recommend flying evaluation board (FEB) action to the wing
        commander or equivalent for individuals who have been in FSC “S” for more than
        180 days (except members in DNIF status). If FEB action is not recommended, the
        unit OG/CC (or equivalent) will notify HQ PACAF/A3TC, 25 E. ST SUITE G-317,
        JBPH-H, HI 96853-5426, and provide supporting documentation as to why the
        individual should not meet an FEB under the provisions of AFI 11-402, Aviation and
        Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Aviation Badges. Do not use FSC “S”
        in lieu of an appropriate aviation service code.
     1.4.1.9. Obtain OG/CC or equivalent approval for assignment of FSC K and provide the
     approval source document to the servicing HARM office for publication of the AO. The
     approval document will contain justification. Provide an information copy to the
     MAJCOM/A3.
     1.4.1.9. (PACAF) NLT 1 Sep each year, the HARM office will notify the OG/CC (or
     equivalent) (and PACAF/A3TC for personnel assigned to the MAJCOM/NAF), in
     writing, of personnel assigned FSC “K”. NLT 15 Sep each year the OG/CC (or
     equivalent) or WG/CC will request HQ PACAF/A3/5 revalidation for all personnel the
     CC desires to extend in FSC “K”. Send FSC “K” revalidation requests (AO, IDS,
     Request letter), electronically to HQ PACAF/A3TC. PACAF/A3TC will staff to
     PACAF/A3/5.
        1.4.1.9.1. The HARM office will use the letter approving return to aviation service as
        the source document to publish an AO to assign FSC K for members returned to
        service as the result of an FEB.
12                                               AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


         1.4.1.9.2. A member’s commander will submit a letter or military orders to the
         servicing HARM office directing assignment of FSC K when the aircraft and/or unit
         is deactivated and the member is still assigned to an active billet pending
         reassignment. MAJCOM/A3 notification is not required.
         1.4.1.9.3. Use the Contingency Exercise Deployment (CED) orders to assign FSC K
         effective the date of the deployment when a member is assigned to an active API and
         deployed to a non-flying assignment for 90 days or more. MAJCOM/A3 notification
         is not required.
         1.4.1.9.3. (PACAF) Aircrew are not authorized to perform flying duties during
         periods of any non-flying TDY to include TDY periods less than 90 days IAW
         paragraphs 2.7.1.5., 2.8.5., 2.9.3., and 2.10.6.
            1.4.1.9.3.1. Use the date the member returned from a non-flying deployment as
            documented by a signed DD Form 1351-2 (or suitable substitute) or commander’s
            letter to return members to active aviation service.
         1.4.1.9.4. In all cases, the HARM office will publish the AO, with explanatory
         remarks. If required, the OG/CC will submit a revalidation request to the
         MAJCOM/A3 no later than 30 September (see paragraph 1.3.5). Upon receipt, the
         HARM office will permanently file all MAJCOM/A3 revalidation approvals on the
         left side of the member’s FRF.
         1.4.1.9.4. (PACAF) FSC “K” letters of explanation and annual revalidation requests
         will be submitted for staffing to the PACAF Aviation Resource Manager (HQ
         PACAF/A3TC) by the servicing HARM office. EXCEPTION: Letters of
         explanation and annual MAJCOM/A3 revalidation is not required for FSC “K”
         assigned to members deployed to a non-flying assignment.
  1.4.2. Commanders, including nonflying unit commanders, manage assigned
  aircrew/parachutist members and coordinate changes affecting aircrew members flying status
  and parachutist members jump status with the HARM office. Note: This includes all Air
  Force Reserve Command Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) flyers assigned to
  active duty units at gaining MAJCOMs.
     1.4.2.1. Commanders will manage rated and CEA aircrew positions IAW AFI 11-412,
     Aircrew Management. API 5, 6, 8, B, and D coded positions may be double-billeted for
     replacement of the primary incumbent only, both members may be assigned an actively
     FAC/FSC provided the overlap is not more than 30 calendar days. On or before the 30th
     day, the commander will identify which aircrew member to assign inactive flying
     activity, FSC H. The MAJCOM/A3 may waive this paragraph to allow double-billeting
     and active flying for no longer than 180 calendar days. This waiver authority will not be
     delegated lower than the MAJCOM/A3. (EXCEPTION: Staff personnel tasked to fill a
     deployed active flying billet may be double billeted for the duration of the deployment).
     1.4.2.1. (PACAF) The HARM will validate aircrew/parachutist manpower position
     assignments quarterly to ensure billeting complies with AFI 11-412, Aircrew
     Management. The SARM will coordinate position assignment and AO action with the
     HARM as necessary. SQ/CCs will assign personnel to a valid position within 10
     working days. If the SQ/CC does not assign the member to an active billet within 10
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                            13


      working days, the HARM will assign the member an inactive FSC “J.” If the member is
      double-billeted, assign FSC H. Psuedo-8 positions are invalid and considered API-0
      (non-flying) positions. Active flyers will not be assigned to a pseudo-8 billet. The AO
      assigning FSC “J” will remain in the record unless documentation can be provided to the
      HARM that proves the member was in a valid flying billet upon assignment.
          1.4.2.1.1. (Added-PACAF) PACAF HARMs will review all API 6, 8, B, and D
          flyers in inactive status due to lack of support (FSC “K”) quarterly. The HARM will
          audit the Unit Manpower Document, or other source document to verify these
          positions. Forward the names of inactive API 6, 8, B, and D incumbents to HQ
          PACAF/A3T, 25 E. ST SUITE G-317, JBPH-H, HI 96853-5426 to be considered for

      positions IAW AFI 11-402.
      1.4.2.3. Commanders will ensure aircrew/parachutist members and/or unit orderly rooms
      notify the base HARM office of all non-flying/non-parachuting/non-controlling TDYs,
      projected PCS, retirement, or separation actions. This requirement can be met by
      forwarding copies of all aircrew/parachutist members/non-controlling TDY, permanent
      change of station (PCS), retirement, or separation orders to the base HARM office to
      process required AO or ARMS actions.
          1.4.2.3.1. Commanders will ensure aircrew/parachutist members pick up their
          FRF/JRF from the HARM office prior to final outprocessing for PCS assignments.
          1.4.2.3.2. Commanders will ensure aircrew/parachutist members and/or unit orderly
          rooms notify the HARM office prior to a permanent change of assignment (PCA)
          action.

1.5. Responsibilities of Aircrew Members and Parachutists.
   1.5.1. Safely and effectively use available flying, controlling and parachute jump resources
   to obtain and maintain aircrew or parachutist qualification when assigned to active flying or
   jump billets. See AFI 11-402 for guidance pertaining to failure of members to accomplish
   aircrew or parachutist training requirements.
   1.5.2. Accomplish an annual flight or jump records review to validate aviation/parachutist
   service actions and the record of flying or jump accomplishments during the previous year.
   HARM offices may e-mail annual record review documents for a member’s review and
   certification. The member will complete the review not later than the end of the member’s
   birth month. Members will acknowledge the review by either sending a signed Individual
   Data Summary (IDS) to the HARM office or by providing an e-mail reply confirming the
   review was completed. File review documentation with the IDS in the FRF/JRF. (Does not
   apply to cadets who do not have FRF/JRF requirements.)
   1.5.2. (PACAF) Aircrew members/parachutists come in phase for their annual records
   review 4 months prior to the end of their birth month. The HARM will update the annual
   records review date in Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) and place the signed
14                                                 AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


  IDS in the aircrew member's flight record folder (FRF). Units may place unsigned ARM
  products in flight record folders to preclude the loss of historical documents pending receipt
  of signed products. If there are any changes to be made and source documents are not
  available, the HARM office will direct the member to the Air Force Board of Corrections of
  Military Records in accordance with      AFI 11-421.
     1.5.2.1. Certification is acknowledgement by the member that the flying/jump data is
     correct. Information maintained in the FRF or JRF will not be changed without official
     source documentation. For example an AFTO Form 781 or AF Form 3520 for missing
     flights and sorties, AETC Form 240-5 for student hours, an AF Form 922 or AF Form
     4323 for missing jumps, Military ID or re-enlistment paperwork for date of separation
     change and personnel data that did not interface to ARMS, etc. In the absence of source
     documents, the member may submit a DD Form 149 to the Air Force Board for
     Corrections to Military Records (AFBCMR) IAW Air Force Pamphlet 36-2607,
     Applicant’s Guide to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR).
     HARM offices will ensure all flying hour corrections (especially to career totals) are
     supported by a source document. File a copy of the DD Form 149 in the FRF IAW AFI
     11-421. Flying hour log books and/or letters submitted under previous Air Force Policy
     will be retained in the FRF IAW AFI 11-421.
     1.5.2.1. (PACAF) E-mail replies confirming flight record review completion will be
     maintained on top of the IDS reviewed and must include the Individual Data Summary,
     Fly History Report, and Individual Flight Record (if applicable) product date. (Example:
     I certify that my annual flight records review is complete and accurate for all products
     dated 03 Jan 2011.).
         1.5.2.1.1. AF/A3O-AT is OPR for AFBCMR requests. AF/A3O-AT may contact
         HARM offices directly to obtain documents for review/validation, to expedite
         corrective action if an AFBCMR request is received, or expedite corrective action to
         ARMS data received on the Consolidated Headquarters Aviation Resource
         Management System (CHARM) report (see AFI 11-421).
     1.5.2.2. Inactive aircrew/jump personnel will accomplish a records review within 120
     days prior to PCS. They are not required to accomplish annual reviews of their FRF/JRF.
     1.5.2.3. Aircrew/jump personnel suspended or disqualified for aviation service will
     accomplish a FRF/JRF review within 30 days of the suspension or disqualification action.
     Geographically separated members will acknowledge the review by either sending a
     signed IDS to the HARM office or by providing an e-mail reply confirming the review
     was completed.
     1.5.2.4. (Added-PACAF) If flight record information is not correct, the aircrew or
     parachutist must sign the IDS and annotate the incorrect information. The member will
     also include the statement “record is not true and accurate” on the first page of the IDS.
     The HARM office will update ARMS with the appropriate code.
  1.5.3. Ensure the HARM office maintaining the FRF or JRF is aware of a pending PCS. The
  HARM office must be advised of the proposed departure date, date of last flight or jump
  before departure, and date the individual will pick up the FRF or JRF. Member must notify
  the HARM office at least five days prior to departure, if applicable. Geographically separated

  members may send a written notification to the attached HARM office to mail their FRF/JRF
  to the gaining base. Validate flights accomplished before departing PCS and sign ARMS
  generated PCS products IAW AFI 11-421.
  1.5.3. (PACAF) Individuals assigned to geographically separated units preparing for a
  permanent change of station (PCS) move will fax or E-mail one copy of AF Form 899,
  Request and Authorization for Permanent Change of Station - Military, to the servicing
  HARM office. Upon notification of pending PCS, the losing HARM office will forward the
  individual Flight Record Folder/Jump Record Folder (FRF/JRF) to the gaining HARM
  office, or to the member as appropriate, via U.S. First Class Mail. Aircrew/parachutists must
  ensure the HARM office receives the most recent AFTO Form 781 and/or AF Form 4323,
  ARMS Multi-Crew Jump Record, documenting flight/jump activity before PCS notification;
  or hand carry and deliver the applicable form extracts to the gaining HARM office.
     1.5.3.1. (Added-PACAF) If applicable, the HARM office will notify PACAF/A3TC to
     delete attachment upon departure to a new assignment.
  1.5.4. Pick up the Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) and FRF or JRF before departing for PCS
  or flying/jumping TDY IAW AFI 11-421. Members initiating parachutist status, scheduled to
  attend jump school, must give the HARM office a copy of their TDY orders at least 5 work-
  days prior to TDY, to allow processing of the initial AO authorizing jump status.
  1.5.4. (PACAF) Individuals scheduled to depart PCS, TDY (e.g. formal school), separate or
  retire will be responsible for notifying the HARM office 5 duty days prior to the date they
  desire to pick up their Flight Record Package (FRP)/Jump Record Package (JRP). The
  FRP/JRP will also include the member’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) if applicable. The
  individual will hand-carry the FRP/JRP to the next duty station. If the member fails to pick-
  up the FRP/JRP, the HARM office will obtain the forwarding address of gaining HARM and
  mail the appropriate records.
  1.5.5. Turn in the FRF or JRF to the proper HARM office (or notify the HARM office that
  the record was mailed) within 10 duty-days after arriving at a new duty station (includes
  flying TDY). Inactive aircrew members and parachutists must also turn in the FRF, JRF, and
  FEF within 10 duty days. If a member does not turn in the FRF or JRF within the 10 day
  limit, the HARM office will suspend aviation career incentive pay (ACIP), career enlisted
  flyer incentive pay (CEFIP), hazardous duty incentive pay (HDIP), and static or high altitude
  low opening (HALO) jump incentive pay by assigning ASC 04 via AO. Upon receipt of the
  member’s FRF/JRF, the HARM office will revoke the suspension and restore incentive pay,
  if otherwise qualified. HARM offices will consider mailed records as “turned in” and will not
  suspend incentive pay for these members. HARM offices will make every effort to contact
  the member prior to stopping incentive pay. HARM offices will ensure FRFs/JRFs are
  inprocessed to the ARMS database NLT 10 calendar days after receipt of the records. Note:
  The losing HARM office will mail the FRF to the gaining HARM office if the member’s
  next duty location HARM office is not collocated within the gaining HARM office.
  1.5.5. (PACAF) Active and inactive flight/jump record folders will be turned into the
  servicing HARM office no later than 5 duty days after arrival at a new duty station. HARMs
  will establish local procedures with the military personnel flight (MPF), military personnel
  element or military personnel section (MPS) to ensure flying/jumping personnel (active and
  inactive) are identified and informed of their responsibility to deliver the FRP/JRP to the
16                                                 AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


  HARM. Inactive members will turn in the FRF/JRF and FEF within 5 days of arriving at a
  new duty station. If the member does not deliver the FRP/JRP to the HARM within the 5
  duty day limit, the HARM will notify the member’s commander of the pending suspension of
  aviation/jump status and ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP effective the 11th duty day after arrival until
  receipt of the FRF/JRF for validation of qualification. Mailed records will be considered
  “turned in” and incentive pay will not be suspended. HARMS will include all notification
  attempts (to include commander notification(s)) with MILPDS validation as background
  material for publication of the ASC 04 (suspension) AO and cite AFI 11-401, paragraph
  1.5.5., as the AO authority. Note: Active flying personnel will not be scheduled for flight
  activity until the HARM receives the FRP/JRP.
     1.5.5.1. Aircrew members and parachutists assigned to an inactive API code/duty
     position (after an active flying assignment – PCA or PCS) will turn in their FEF to the
     HARM office within five duty days of assignment to an inactive API code/flying position
     (i.e. API-6 flyer is placed in an API-3 position). The HARM office will file the FEF
     inside the member’s FRF. If the member returns to active flying status, the HARM office
     will contact the member to pick up the FEF or forward the FEF to the member’s flying
     unit. (If the FEF is forwarded, the HARM office will retain a copy of the contents until
     receipt is acknowledged by the gaining unit.)
     1.5.5.1. (PACAF) Suspended and disqualified aircrew members will turn in their FEF to
     the HARM office within five duty days of suspension or disqualification. The HARM
     office will file the FEF inside the member’s FRF. If the member returns to active flying
     status, the HARM office will contact the member to pick up the FEF or forward the FEF
     to the member’s flying unit. (Note: If the FEF is forwarded, the HARM office will retain
     a copy of the contents until receipt is acknowledged by the gaining unit.)
  1.5.6. Turn in medical records to the Flight Medicine Element (FME) within 10 duty-days
  after arriving at new duty station and complete initial medical clearance requirements prior to
  first flight or jump.
     1.5.6.1. Initial medical clearance requirements also apply to members who deploy for
     365 days or longer in TDY or PCS status.
  1.5.7. Complete flight physicals and Preventive Health Assessment (PHA) IAW AFI 48-123,
  Medical Examinations and Standards and AFI 44-170, Preventive Health Assessment.

   assigned FSC “K” IAW paragraph 1.3.5, or dual billeted aircrew assigned FSC “H” IAW
   paragraph 1.4.2.1
   1.5.11. When aircrew members depart PCS or PCA, ensure sign-out from unit/base does not
   negatively affect Operational Flying Duty Accumulation (OFDA) credit. Aircrew members
   require at least 15 days on active flying status in a month to receive OFDA credit for that
   month. See paragraph 2.5 for additional guidance pertaining to operational flying duty.
       1.5.11.1. Aircrew members assigned to an active flying billet who are being reassigned
       to an inactive billet should make every effort to outprocess from their unit/base after the
       15th of the month to provide an opportunity to obtain the last month of OFDA credit (if
       flight requirements are also met).
       1.5.11.2. Aircrew members assigned to an inactive billet who are being reassigned to an
       active billet should outprocess from their unit/base before the 15th of the month to
       provide an opportunity to obtain OFDA credit for the first month of assignment in an
       active billet (if flight requirements are also met).
1.6. Flying Obligations.
   1.6.1. During Time of War. Commanders (including unit commanders) may order Air
   Force members on active duty to make flights in any aircraft. Members are not entitled to
   incentive pay unless placed on active AOs that require them to perform specific in-flight
   duties on a frequent and regular basis as defined in this instruction. Members are not entitled

  qualified and flight requirements are met (does not apply to non-interference fliers on AOs).
  Rated officers and CEAs will receive OFDA credit if otherwise qualified.
     1.6.2.1. Military and civil service (GS) aircrew members who are properly qualified,
     meet the criteria of this instruction and AFI 11-402 for initiating aviation service, and are
     directed to perform specific inflight duties on a frequent and regular basis will be placed
     on AOs and a flight authorization.
         1.6.2.1.1. An aircrew member not obtaining or maintaining qualification in a specific
         aircraft will be placed on the flight authorization for that aircraft only when his or her
         presence is required for accomplishment of the mission. (See also paragraph 1.8.1)
         These members will log time IAW paragraph 3.2 of this instruction.
         1.6.2.1.2. Aircrew members in a specialty not listed in an AFI 65-503, US Air Force
         Cost and Planning Factors, crew complement, who are not obtaining or maintaining

     adequate facilities for transporting passengers. Refer to paragraphs 1.8.3, 1.9.4.7., 2.10.5.,
     and applicable MDS-Specific guidance for further passenger guidance/restrictions.
     1.6.2.4. Commanders, including unit commanders, may detail by written orders
     personnel under their command to take part in aircraft flights operated by any foreign
     government accredited by the United States, provided the flights do not add additional
     expense to the US Government, and provided personnel are on AOs authorizing frequent
     and regular flights. See paragraph 1.11 for additional guidance.
     1.6.2.5. Personnel who are required for the execution of the aircraft or unit mission and
     personnel not authorized AOs (as specified above) tasked to perform unique ground
     support duties at an enroute location or destination point that are directly related and
     essential to accomplishment of the aircraft or unit mission may fly as Mission Essential
     Personnel (MEP). MAJCOMs may further define MEP in MAJCOM supplements to this
     instruction, but guidance may not be less restrictive than the guidance contained herein.
     See paragraph 1.12.2.2 for additional guidance, and Attachment 1, Terms, for MEP
     definition.
         1.6.2.5.1. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the mission being
         flown authorizes MEP status. If operational control transfers, the OG/CC (or
         equivalent) who assumes follow-on operational control may continue/revise MEP
         status (coordinate changes with originating OG/CC). MAJCOMs may establish intra-
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                          19


          command and inter-command guidance to facilitate this process. MEP may only fly
          on aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R, Air
          Transportation Eligibility. EXCEPTIONS: MEP who are mission essential may fly
          on aircraft not normally equipped for carrying passengers. MEP who fly under the
          provisions of this exception must be physically and physiologically (when required)
          qualified and must complete applicable egress training prior to flight.
          1.6.2.5.2. (Added-PACAF) Reference Attachment 6 for additional MEP guidance.
      1.6.2.6. MAJCOMs may designate aircrew members who travel as additional
      crewmembers (not required for the mission being flown but required for follow-on
      missions) as MEP. Approval authority may be delegated below MAJCOM level.
          1.6.2.6.1. For AMC missions already in the system, the TACC Senior Controller may
          approve MEP status. For other MAJCOM missions in the system, MAJCOMs may
          designate (in MAJCOM supplements) individuals who may approve MEP status for
          members assigned to the command. Approval authority will be retained at the
          MAJCOM level unless the MAJCOM functional authority is exercised from a
          subordinate NAF, in which case the NAF may exercise approval authority.
          MAJCOM Standardization/ Evaluation Chiefs may approve MEP status for
          MAJCOM or MAJCOM-gained missions for evaluators assigned to the MAJCOM.
          Additional crewmembers who fly in MEP status may only fly on aircraft capable of
          carrying passengers IAW provisions of DoD 4515.13-R.
          1.6.2.6.1. (PACAF) For PACAF missions that have departed their originating
          location, OG/CC approved MEP are approved through the final destination as
          identified on the Flight Authorization itinerary. Once an aircraft has departed the
          originating location, the PACAF AMD Commander or the Deputy Commander may
          approve MEP status for individuals not previously authorized by the originating
          location OG/CC for PACAF owned missions. For MEP approval on TACC owned
          missions, seethe basic AFI for guidance.

Section 1B—Flight Authorization

1.8. Aircraft Flight Authorizations.
   1.8.1. Prior to all flights in Air Force aircraft, commanders (including unit commanders)
   issue written authorizations documenting all personnel required to perform inflight duties on
   the mission. Units will use AF Form 4327, ARMS Fighter Flight Authorization, or AF Form
   4327a, Crew Flight Authorization, as applicable to the unit aircraft. A commander's
   (including unit commanders) verbal authorization may direct aircraft flight only when time
   constraints or administrative procedures prevent written authorization. Written confirmation
   of this order must be issued within three duty-days. Once a Flight Authorization (FA) has
   been signed, changes to aircrew names and/or duty positions must be validated by a
   designated approving authority by placing the approving authority's initials by the line
   changed. The OG/CC or equivalent commander with operational control of the mission is
   responsible for the publication/ maintenance/retention of the aircraft FAs for each mission
   flown by the aircraft. Only commissioned officers and officer equivalent government
   civilians in active flying positions are authorized to be authenticating officials for Flight
   Authorizations. FA authenticating officials will be appointed in writing by the OG/CC or
   equivalent commander. EXCEPTION 1: Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), Pararescue (PJ), and
   ANG Senior Scout unit commanders and properly designated authenticating officials may
   publish a FA for assigned aircrew members required to perform aircrew duties on the
   mission. Commanders or designated authenticating officials must ensure all members listed
   meet go/no-go criteria prior to authenticating the FA. The FA is not a stand-alone document
   and must be attached to the aircraft FA for the mission on which aircrew members were
   required to perform in-flight duties. If the AE or PJ crew is scheduled to perform aircrew
   duties on more than one mission, a remark will be placed on the FA to depict variations. As a
   minimum, the information in blocks 11 through 18 must be documented on the flight
   authorization. In the Remarks section of the aircraft FA, annotate the AE/pararescue FA
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                             21


  number, date, and unit designation. The FA is a critical document used to validate aircrew
  member‘s duties/flight time logged on the AFTO Form 781. Officers or officer equivalent
  government civilians will be designated as FA authenticating officials in writing by the
  OG/CC or equivalent commander. Members properly designated as FA authenticating
  officials IAW this paragraph are not required to be assigned to an active flying position to
  perform FA authentication duties. EXCEPTION 2: RPA units will complete a preflight
  authorization signed by the aircraft commander to confirm go/no-go checks were completed.
  The authenticating official will issue a verbal order for the mission. The FA will be published
  upon termination of the mission and include crew members who flew on the mission, verbal
  order acknowledged in the remark section, and AC block initialed by the duty scheduler.
  1.8.1. (PACAF) For all PACAF units, use the AF Form 4327, ARMS Fighter Flight
  Authorization or AF Form 4327a, Crew Flight (FA) Authorization, or a computer-generated
  (GDSS, PEX. etc.) equivalent. Flight Authorizations generated by these automated systems
  must contain all the required information contained on the actual Air Force form. These
  forms/formats will be used for all missions including those flown in the local area. Number
  all flight authorizations consecutively beginning with the first flight departing 1 Oct of each
  fiscal year (Example – 12-0001) and maintain the numbers in a flight authorization number
  log. Maintain flight authorizations and logs IAW AFRIMS, Table 13-10.
     1.8.1.1. Units will validate go/no-go qualification IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew
     Standardization/Evaluation Program, prior to authorizing members to participate in
     aircrew or operational support duties. Once a FA has been published, the pilot in
     command, or FA authenticating official if the pilot in command is not available, will
     validate go/no-go status for additional aircrew or operational support members prior to
     authorizing them to fly and adding or attaching them to the FA. Validation may include
     ARMS products IAW AFI 11-421 (or comparable database for USAFA airmanship
     programs), a FA from an AE, Pararescue, or Senior Scout unit commander (or designated
     representative), or a letter from the member’s unit validating the individual‘s
     qualification to fly on required missions. Note: When preparing flight authorizations for
     missions scheduled on future dates, the aviation resource management specialist or
     designated representative responsible for go/no-go validation will confirm the member’s
     AO status and ensure currency (to include flight physical and physiological training) and
     qualification will remain valid through the scheduled flight date(s). The FA is an official
     document depicting what actually occurred on the mission. The original, printed, signed
     forms with changes annotated are required documentation. Reproduction and disposal of
     the original forms to remove pen/ink changes after the flight authenticating official has
     signed the form and sorties/missions have occurred is not authorized.
  1.8.2. The flight authorization must include (minimum requirements):
     1.8.2.1. A designated pilot-in-command, and formation flight leader of each flight or
     flight element.
     1.8.2.1. (PACAF) The Pilot In Command (PIC) is responsible for the safe conduct of
     the mission to include en route crew rest. In multi-place aircraft the aircraft commander
     or above will occupy either the left or right seat during all takeoffs and landings. Unless
     the AFI 11-2-MDS Vol 3 dictates otherwise, the designated PIC (A-code) is not required
     to occupy a primary position but still retains overall authority for conduct of the mission.
22                                                  AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


     Only one person will be in command at a time. Notify all members of the crew and
     deliver a complete aircrew briefing when a change of command occurs.
         1.8.2.1.1. (Added-PACAF) For missions that are authorized two complete crews, an
         aircraft commander will be in command of each crew. Designate one as the operating
         crew and the other as the additional crew for specific route segments or to the mission
         turnaround point. Prepare a separate flight order and designate the operating
         segments for each crew.
     1.8.2.2. Name, grade, and flight authorization duty code (Table A2.3) of each
     crewmember, operational support flier, or any other official personnel (use the position
     designation established by the MAJCOM) required for the mission or flight.
     1.8.2.3. Type, serial number, mission symbol, and call sign of aircraft or formation.
     1.8.2.4. Place from which the flight will depart plus “on-or-about” departure date.
     1.8.2.5. An itinerary and the phrase “Variations in itinerary authorized.”
  1.8.3. Flight authorizations will only include personnel on AOs (or contract aircrew
  personnel on a memorandum of agreement/contract) authorized to perform in-flight duties
  for that mission according to paragraphs 1.10 and 3.2 of this instruction. Except for MEP and
  non-interference members, individuals on the flight authorization should match those
  authorized to log time on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract.
     1.8.3.1. Personnel who are on the aircraft for point-to-point travel, an
     orientation/familiarization flight or to only perform a proficiency jump (not performing
     aircrew duties for that mission) will be listed on the passenger manifest. Passenger
     manifesting is required on all DoD owned and controlled aircraft, IAW DoD 4500.09-E,
     Transportation and Traffic Management.
     1.8.3.2. If MEP are transported, IAW MAJCOM supplements, they may be listed on the
     flight authorization in the Remarks section only. If MEP are listed on the flight
     authorization, the Remarks section will include all information required by DD Form
     2131, Passenger Manifest, to include emergency contact information. If MEP are not
     listed on the flight authorization, they must be placed on the passenger manifest. MEP
     will not be listed on the AFTO Form 781, will not log time, and will not accrue OFDA
     credit.
  1.8.4. If a mission is cancelled after the FA is signed, line through the canceled portion(s) of
  the flight authorization and annotate the reason for cancellation (e.g. weather or maintenance
  cancel).
  1.8.4. (PACAF) PACAF Units are required to maintain cancelled FAs numerically in the
  original record set with the annotated reason for cancellation.
  1.8.5. MAJCOMs will establish procedures to ensure compliance with the guidance in this
  section for alert sorties.
  1.8.5. (PACAF) PACAF units may publish a FA template omitting mission number,
  destination, mission symbol and purpose, aircraft tail number, call sign, and flight
  authorization number for alert sorties. If missions are alerted, omitted information must be
  added (pen-and-ink) to the FA template, assigned a FA number, incorporated into the flight
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                              23


   authorization log and filed in the original record set within three duty-days IAW paragraph
   1.8.1. of the basic AFI.
   1.8.6. (Added-PACAF) Unit commanders will not authorize any crewmember to be on the
   flight authorization who is DNIF, on leave, on permissive TDY, on a non-flying TDY, or
   who will enplane or deplane en-route for leave purpose. Personnel DNIF, on leave,
   permissive TDY, or non-flying TDY will not perform aircrew or operational support duties
   on PACAF aircraft, and will not receive credit for flight time and/or flight training events.
1.9. Authorization for Using US Air Force Aircraft.
   1.9.1. Commanders (including unit commanders) authorize aircraft flights to support
   command operations.
   1.9.2. Commanders (including unit commanders) will ensure each flight is in the direct
   interest of government business and does not exceed flying hour allocations without specific
   approval. Commanders (including unit commanders) will not authorize flights for personal
   convenience or recreation.
   1.9.3. The transportation of passengers and cargo will be in accordance with DoD 4515.13-
   R. The Deputy Chief of Staff/Logistics, Installations & Mission Support (HQ USAF/A4/7),
   develops and publishes passenger policy to oversee passenger movement. AFI 24-101,
   Passenger Movement, provides guidance and procedures for arranging official transportation
   of Air Force personnel.
   1.9.4. Commanders (including unit commanders) may use Air Force aircraft under their
   control to:
      1.9.4.1. Perform tactical and combat operations.
      1.9.4.2. Train aircrew personnel and evaluate aircrew performance.
      1.9.4.3. Allow aircrews to meet the flying requirements of this instruction.
      1.9.4.4. Further national health or safety interests, to include saving of human life if a

      guidelines.
          1.9.4.7.1. Orientation Flights. The USAF conducts orientation flights to reward and
          motivate individuals (incentive orientation flights only), ensure a better understanding
          of a particular weapon system and its role, or when the flight is determined to be in
          the best interest of the USAF. Orientation flights may be approved as provided in
24                                             AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


     DoD 4515.13-R and this instruction. No authority exists for approval of an orientation
     flight during which a record attempt is made, a first flight is made on an aircraft just
     accepted into the inventory, a first flight over an isolated geographical area, or any
     other flight of a similar or special nature, where abnormal conditions may exist.
     Table 1.1 is a matrix of approval authorities for orientation flights.

      policy/All other
      orientation flights
 This table provides approval authority guidance for orientation flights (as defined in DoD
 4515.13-R, Chapter 4) only. Guidance for Public Affairs flights (ref. DoD 4515.13-R,
 Chapter 3) is provided in the DoD regulation and in AFI 35-103.
NOTES:
1. “Orientation flights” are defined as continuous flights performed within the local flying area
and terminating at the point of origin (DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 4). “Note 1 N/A,” means the
category of flight may not be considered an orientation flight; however, it is included in the table
as a consolidated reference source.
        1a. EXCEPTION: Units may accomplish orientation flights within the local flying area
to operational and remote sites that are part of the home unit, as long as the mission terminates at
the point of origin. Such flights providing unit mission orientation are not considered point-to-
point flights and an exception to policy is not required (OSD-ATL policy guidance, Feb 10).
2. Requests for point-to-point travel must be specifically addressed and approved by SECAF.
Retiring members of Congress and retiring congressional staff members may be flown on
orientation flights only upon the written approval of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Legislative Affairs (ASD[LA]). (Ref. DSD Memo, 23 Dec 1996.) For Line 1, initiate action
through SAF/LLO (SAF/LLO Workflow in the Global Address List).
3. When aircraft are “chopped” or assigned to a gaining Combatant Commander, approval
authority will be the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) or Theater Special Operations
Command (SOC) commander.
4. Inform AF/CC, AF/A3/5, AF/A3O, AF/A3O-A, if approved.                  (Provide notification to
respective Workflows in the Global Address List.)
5. Flights involving foreign nationals must be reviewed for foreign disclosure requirements and
political concerns. Foreign government officials are equivalent to U.S. Federal government
officials and do not include local government officials such as mayors, police chiefs, and other
local officials who do not represent a foreign government at the national level. Foreign military
“civilian equivalents” are comparable to DoD “civilian equivalents.”
a. Ensure foreign disclosure requirements and base visit requests are satisfied according to AFI
16-201, Air Force Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program. Contact MAJCOM
or COCOM Foreign Disclosure Officer (FDO) for assistance.
b. Coordinate with the country director in the appropriate SAF/IA regional division (four-letter
level), before approval, to ensure no political concerns exist that would prevent the flight.
Contact SAF/IAR(_) on the Global address list at saf.iar_@pentagon.af.mil (blank space is for
SAF/IA Regional Division: A for AFRICOM, C for CENTCOM, E for EUCOM, L for
NORTHCOM/SOUTHCOM, P for PACOM).
6. This authorization does not include transportation to or from the exercise area or supporting
flights utilized for logistics purposes only.

7. Does not include spouses of government personnel, non-DoD Federal officials, or members of
Congress and their staffs.
8. For foreign students enrolled in USAF Academy or ROTC programs, ensure foreign
disclosure requirements (AFI 16-201) concerning visit authorizations and disclosure of USAF
information are satisfied.
9. This is not intended to allow all Government contractor employees to fly. The contractors
must be performing work in direct support of the approving command (aircrew training system
and aircraft maintenance contractors are the most frequent participants). Normally, the
requirement for familiarization flights should be specified in the government contract.
10. Foreign citizens are not included in DoD 4515.13-R as passengers eligible for orientation
flights.
11. For youth in Congressionally sanctioned, DoD-approved Youth Programs, program
participants may take part in no more than one orientation flight (Ref DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter
4). Parental and/or guardian permission is required and the flight must be approved by SAF/PA.
Specific Public Law guidance applies, including Title 10 United States Code (USC), Section
2012, and Title 32 USC, Section 508.
12. Passengers on orientation flights under 18 years of age require parental approval in writing.
13. Requests for exception to policy must be submitted through command channels according to
DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 10, and AFI 24-101. Note: Exception to policy authority delegated
from AF/CC to AF/CV IAW AFI 24-101. Send exception to policy requests to AF/A3/5 with an
info copy to AF/A3O-AT.
14. Cadets and midshipmen are authorized orientation flights while on leave status.
15. Aircrew members in suspended (ASC 04) or DNIF status are not authorized familiarization/
orientation or incentive flights without an approved waiver from AF/A3O-AT.

 CAUTION: During contingency operations or in any designated combat or imminent danger
 zone, orientation flights may only be flown if the mission aircraft continuously remains
 outside of hostile airspace. Conduct all flights in this category to prevent exposure to any
 unnecessary risk, or inadvertently authorize entitlement to hostile fire or imminent danger
 pay. These restrictions apply to all categories of orientation flights. Furthermore, unit
 incentive flights may only be flown on designated training sorties.

1.10. Authorization to Perform Inflight Duties in Air Force Aircraft.
   1.10.1. To perform inflight or parachutist duties, members must be specifically authorized
   and required for the mission, physically qualified, and current in physiological training when
   required IAW AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program. (Note: See AFI 11-
   202V1 for guidance regarding physiological training requirements if member will be
   removed from flying status within four months following the expiration date of physiological
   training currency.) Unit commanders will restrict individuals from performing inflight duties
   in the unit assigned aircraft when such performance may adversely impact safety, morale, or
   mission accomplishment. Commanders (including unit commanders) may authorize the
   following personnel to perform aircrew duties (as part of the authorized crew complement
   IAW AFI 65-503, or required for the mission, IAW paragraph 3.2.1.5 of this instruction) and
   operational support duties (IAW AFI 11-402) on board or supporting Air Force aircraft:
NOTES:
1. For guidance applicable to parachutist members performing duties in Air Force aircraft, see
AFI 11-410.
2. An aircrew member, non-interference RPA sensor operator (1N1XX), or parachutist in DNIF
status will not perform inflight aircrew or parachutist duties.
3. If not otherwise restricted by AF Form 1042 or MAJCOM guidance, aircrew members in
DNIF status may perform aircrew duties in the simulator for which they are qualified.
       1.10.1.1. Qualified members of US military services who hold a current aeronautical
       rating or aviation badge, are on active AOs to take part in frequent and regular flights,
       and are within the authorized crew complement (AFI 65-503) for the aircraft or are
       required for the mission.
           1.10.1.1.1. Aircrew members will perform duty associated with their current
           aeronautical rating and aircrew qualification, unless ordered to perform mission-
           essential rated duties outside their normal aircrew specialty in direct support of
           MAJCOM (or equivalent) -approved operations. Flying solely for the purpose of
           qualifying for incentive pay or OFDA credit is not authorized.
           1.10.1.1.2. When members are ordered to perform rated duties outside their current
           aeronautical rating and aircrew qualification, commanders will ensure members are
           trained and qualified to perform other rated duties. Commanders will provide a
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                         31


        memorandum to the member’s servicing HARM office with justification for the
        action. HARM personnel will file this memorandum permanently in the member’s
        FRF and change the member’s crew position to Y in ARMS (see also Table A2.3).
        See AFI 11-421 for specific HARM actions.
     1.10.1.2. Qualified non-rated officers and enlisted personnel of US military services on
     AOs, who are required to perform mission essential inflight duties on a full time basis,
     and are within the authorized crew complement (AFI 65-503) for the aircraft or are
     required for the mission.
        1.10.1.2.1. Aircrew members will perform duty associated with their current aircrew
        specialty and aircrew qualification. Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying for
        incentive pay or OFDA credit is not authorized.
     1.10.1.3. Operational support fliers on AOs and required to perform specific inflight
     duties on an occasional basis that cannot be accomplished by regularly assigned crew
     members, and other non-rated/non-CEA members on non-interference AOs (paragraphs
     2.10.3 and 2.10.4) who fly occasionally to perform specific official inflight tasks.
        1.10.1.3.1. Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying for Hazardous Duty Incentive
        Pay is not authorized.
     1.10.1.4. Personnel authorized by competent authority to receive instruction in aircrew
     duties at Air Force schools.
     1.10.1.5. Professionally qualified civilian employees of the US Government.
     1.10.1.5. (PACAF) U.S. Government civilian employees will meet the same
     proficiency, currency, and medical standards as military members in like positions.
     Flying must be specified in the member’s current duty position description (PD) or AF
     Core Document (CD). Create civilian employees in ARMS as a dummy record utilizing
     the appropriate NUSIC code as their social security number. The HARM will publish an
     AF Form 1887, Aeronautical Order (PA)Aviation Service for these personnel with no
     ASC. US Government civilian employee flying time will not be entered in ARMS. Only
     maintain training information in ARMS on civilian employees.
        1.10.1.5.1. MAJCOM commanders determine individual qualifications.          May be
        delegated to MAJCOM/A3.
     1.10.1.6. Qualified employees or prospective employees of a government contractor
     according to the terms and conditions of a current government contract.
        1.10.1.6.1. Unless otherwise directed, MAJCOM commanders determine individual
        qualifications. May be delegated to MAJCOM/A3.
        1.10.1.6.2. The Squadron Aviation Resource Management office will keep a copy of
        the contract on file. HARM offices may enter government contractors in ARMS for
        the purpose of tracking aircrew training and physical/physiological qualifications
        when the member will perform flying duties on a frequent basis. Updating and
        tracking flying time in ARMS is not authorized.
     1.10.1.7. Foreign nationals according to Section 1C of this instruction.

     1.10.1.8. Cadets assigned to the US Air Force Academy, Air Force Reserve Officer
     Training Corps (ROTC) cadets, Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences
     (USUHS) and Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) students participating in
     aviation related activities; and Civil Air Patrol (CAP) cadets authorized to participate in
     flying duties as observers, in a special training status, on missions as determined by the
     MAJCOM.
     1.10.1.8. (PACAF) In PACAF, cadets in this category are authorized to participate in
     any normal training mission provided they have a current flight physical and
     physiological training. Individuals are further required to complete applicable Aircrew
     Flight Equipment/egress training before flight. HARM office will publish an AF Form
     1887 for cadets, but will not enter them into ARMS.
        1.10.1.8.1. HARM offices will publish AOs for such cadets or students. Neither
        flying incentive pay nor flying duty credit is authorized, nor will aviation service
        dates be established.
        1.10.1.8.2. Cadet training sorties prescribed in paragraph 1.10.1.8 are not orientation
        sorties. Observer sorties may be conducted IAW all regularly-scheduled sorties and
        are not restricted to the local flying area. They may be flown in conjunction with
        student training and IP continuation training sorties, as well as IAW direct support
        flights, but may not be flown on functional check flight (FCF) or operational check
        flight (OCF) sorties.
        1.10.1.8.3. The purpose of cadet training sorties is to introduce cadets to USAF
        flying operations and motivate cadets to consider a career as a rated aircrew member.
        As such, all normally-permitted training events, to include touch and go landings,
        aerobatics, air combat maneuvering, air refueling, and low level training, are
        authorized. An IP must be at the controls during all critical phases of flight on cadet
        training sorties.
     1.10.1.9. Cadets assigned to the US Air Force Academy and Air Force ROTC cadets
     enrolled in approved USAFA flying programs are accorded aircrew status while actively
     participating in such programs.
        1.10.1.9.1. Cadets will be placed on an AF Form 1887, Aeronautical Order Aviation
        Service, authorizing flying status while participating in approved USAFA flying
        programs. Cadets will not be entered into an operational ARMS database, an Aviation
        Service Code (ASC) will not be assigned, and an Aviation Service Date (ASD) will
        not be established. Neither flying incentive pay nor OFDA credit is authorized.
     1.10.1.10. (Added-PACAF) General Officers (GO) may fly in one of two distinct
     categories: (1) General Officer Operational Flying positions, and (2) Indoctrination
     Flying positions. General officers in the first category maintain a qualification per AFI
     11-202, Vol 1. General officers in the second category will not maintain aircraft
     qualification. Flying under indoctrination status is covered in AFI 11-401, paragraph
     2.14.
  1.10.2. Family members will not be assigned to airborne duty on the same aircraft for a
  given mission. Family member is defined as spouse, brother, sister, parent, and child.

   1.10.2. (PACAF) HQ PACAF/A3/5 is the approval authority for family members
   performing airborne duty on the same aircraft for a given mission. Forward requests through
   command channels to PACAF/A3TC, 25 E. ST SUITE G-317, JBPH-H, HI 96853-5426.
       1.10.2.1. MAJCOMs are authorized to waive this prohibition on a case-by-case basis,
       only when unusual conditions dictate.
       1.10.2.2. Paragraph 1.10.2 does not preclude additional family members from traveling
       aboard an aircraft in a non aircrew-duty status, when such members are otherwise eligible
       for air transportation.
1.11. Authorization to Perform Inflight Duties in Non-US Air Force Aircraft.
   1.11.1. With MAJCOM approval, aircrew members in active flying positions, and
   authorized operational support personnel, may perform appropriate duties in non-US Air
   Force aircraft if it is in the interest of the US Government, approved by the authority that
   controls the aircraft, the members are qualified or are authorized to receive training prior to
   qualification and, if applicable, licensed to perform such duties. Prior to authorizing these
   missions, MAJCOMs will ensure a valid requirement for a USAF aircrew member to
   operationally fly exists, which cannot be accomplished in USAF aircraft. For operational
   support flying, justification must show that qualified aircrew or operational support personnel
   of other (non-US Air Force) services or applicable organizations cannot perform such duties.
   Requests to fly solely for the purpose of qualifying for incentive pay or OFDA credit will not
   be approved.
NOTES:
1. MAJCOMs will identify approval authorities in MAJCOM Supplements. Authority may be
delegated below the MAJCOM level.
2. If the aircrew member is not assigned/attached to a MAJCOM for flying duties (such as a
Combatant Command with a geographic area of responsibility), the Air Force air operations
element within that organization will accomplish the MAJCOM function.
3. For members who attend flying training that includes flights in non-USAF aircraft, the orders
directing such activity constitute MAJCOM approval and satisfy validation requirements for
paragraph 1.11.1. The member’s servicing HARM office will file a copy of the orders in the
member’s flight record folder as the source document for authorization to fly in non-USAF
aircraft.
4. Aircrew members will perform duties associated with their current aeronautical rating and
aircrew qualification, or when specifically authorized to perform mission-related observation or
evaluation duties. If a waiver is required to accommodate unique requirements, submit request
IAW paragraph 1.7.2.
   1.11.1. (PACAF) PACAF/A3TC is the OPR for processing requests to perform in-flight
   duties in non-USAF aircraft if it is in the best interest of the US Government, approved by
   the authority that controls the aircraft, and the members are qualified and, if applicable,
   licensed to perform such duties. Approval authority is PACAF/A3T. Request must be
   received at least three weeks prior to the proposed flight. Requests not received within the
   specified time period run the risk of not getting approved. Blanket authorization request will

  be entertained on a case-by-case basis. The Wing Commander is responsible for the line of
  duty determination.
     1.11.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Qualified Pararescue and Combat Rescue Officer personnel
     (X-coded) are authorized to perform in-flight duties and maintain flying currency on
     foreign and sister service aircraft they are current and qualified on when in performance
     of their assigned duties. Current and qualified is defined as having a current physical,
     aeronautical orders, current AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification
     Worksheet, with aircraft assignment, a closed book test with questions covering the
     foreign or sister-service aircraft, and egress completed. For logging time on aircraft not
     listed on the member’s current AF Form 4324, the member must provide a mission
     requirement letter IAW Attachment 11 of this supplement (signed by the sister service or
     Foreign Flying Unit CC and approved by the CJSOAC or member’s group commander)
     referencing the reason(s) the member was required for the mission and listing the
     member’s current qualification in that specific aircraft. If not qualified, members must
     log “XJ” and other time. An AF Form 4324 (depicting aircrew certification for that
     aircraft) and an AF Form 1522, ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment Report
     (showing egress and other qualifications) are required.
     1.11.1.2. (Added-PACAF) PACAF Flight Surgeons, assigned to an API-5 coded
     position may perform in-flight duties in non-USAF aircraft under any of the following
     circumstance:
         1.11.1.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Sister service, or other allied aircraft/crew where the
         local PACAF flight medicine element routinely provides medical support to non-
         USAF crew members IAW the terms of an existing support agreement.
         1.11.1.2.2. (Added-PACAF) PACAF Flight Surgeons participating in a joint service
         or multi-nation exercise (e.g., COPE TIGER, RED FLAG ALASKA) and required to

         USAF crew members.
     1.11.1.3. (Added-PACAF) Aeromedical Evacuation Flight Nurses and Technicians
     assigned to the 18 AES are approved to participate in a C-130 training mission with the
     1st Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW) to maintain proficiency if all attempts have been
     exhausted and are unable to complete a flight for over 30 days on an USAF C-130.
     Back-to-back training flights in the Marine C-130 are not authorized unless another 30
     days has elapsed.
  1.11.2. Performing duties in non-US Air Force aircraft does not remove military personnel
  from line-of-duty determination status. When aircrew members are not assigned to API 7 or
  API G coded positions, MAJCOMs will provide the member’s HARM office with a letter of
  justification authorizing the member to perform official aircrew duties in non-US Air Force
  aircraft and log flying time IAW paragraph 3.2 HARM offices will use this letter as the
  source document to assign an appropriate aircrew qualification code IAW AFI 11-421.

   1.11.3. Orientation Flights in Non-US Air Force Aircraft. MAJCOMs may authorize
   orientation flights in non-US Air Force aircraft for individuals within their command who are
   otherwise eligible to fly on US Government aircraft. This authority may be delegated, but not
   lower than wing commander or equivalent level. Prior to authorizing such flights, approving
   authorities will ensure a valid requirement exists. Obtain approval from the appropriate
   authority that controls the non-USAF aircraft. The approving office will clearly indicate to
   the non-USAF controlling authority and the foreign government (as applicable) that
   acceptance of an orientation flight does not imply that the USAF/US Government will extend
   a reciprocal invitation to non-USAF or foreign government (as applicable) personnel.
   Individuals will not log flight time on orientation flights. Flights do not satisfy flight pay or
   OFDA requirements.
   1.11.3. (PACAF) Orientation flights in Non-US Air Force Aircraft. PACAF/A3T is the
   approval authority for NAF/CCs and all members of HQ PACAF staff. PACAF/A3TC is the
   OPR for processing requests (NAF/CCs and members of HQ PACAF staff) to participate in
   orientation flights on non-USAF aircraft. Request must be received at least three weeks prior
   to the proposed flight. Requests not received within the specified time period runs the risk of
   not getting approved. Approval authority within the NAF and wings (or equivalent) is
   delegated as follows:
      1.11.3.1. (Added-PACAF) NAF/CC (may be delegated to NAF/A3) is approval
      authority for their staff and all WG/CCs under their command.
      1.11.3.2. (Added-PACAF) WG/CC (or equivalent) is approval authority for members
      within their command.
      1.11.3.3. (Added-PACAF) While performing official duties during joint exercises,
      PACAF aircrew members are authorized to participate in orientation flights in aircraft
      belonging to the host nation. Commanders will ensure a valid requirement exists;
      participation in such flights is in the best interest of the Air Force and authorization does
      not imply reciprocal flights in PACAF aircraft. Approval for such flights is delegated to
      the Wing Commander of the individual receiving the flight, with the concurrence of the
      commander of the unit offering the flight.
   1.11.4. USAF Exchange Personnel. See AFI 16-107, Military Personnel Exchange
   Program, for additional guidance regarding USAF exchange personnel flying with foreign
   air forces.
1.12. Requirements for Pilots in Dual Controlled Aircraft.
   1.12.1. Every flight in a dual-controlled aircraft requires two pilots with current qualification
   in the aircraft. Anytime an individual not fully qualified in the specific mission-design-series
   (MDS) occupies a pilot’s seat with a set of controls, a current and qualified instructor pilot
   will occupy the other seat. EXCEPTIONS:
      1.12.1.1. If operational, command mission requirements, or MDS-specific instructions
      dictate that these requirements are not practical.
      1.12.1.2. To accommodate training programs for checkout or continuation programs.

  the aircraft. For general officer flying, waiver authority to this guidance is AF/CC.
  EXCEPTIONS:
     1.12.2.1. To accommodate training objectives required by formal training programs. This
     exception allows passengers, who are an integral part of the mission (e.g., Pararescue,
     Rangers, CCT, SEALs, etc.) and when their presence is required by the training syllabus,
     to be on board the aircraft. During such times, a current and qualified instructor pilot will
     occupy the other pilot’s seat.
     1.12.2.2. In order to accommodate training objectives or mission requirements, pilots
     (including non-current or unqualified pilots) and other aircrew members, when their
     presence is required by the training syllabus, authorized to obtain and maintain
     qualification in a particular MDS aircraft may occupy a pilot’s seat for purposes of

NOTES:
1. APIs 1, 2, and A are for officers and CEAs assigned to line flying positions or assigned to
   formal flying training programs. The primary duty of these crewmembers is flying.
2. API 3, 4, 6, 8, B, C, D, and E identify crewmembers assigned to supervisory or staff
   positions. These positions require aircrew expertise (API 3, 4, 6, 8, B, D, and E) and some
   require active flying (API 6, 8, B, and D) or ground based radar duties (API 6, 8).
3. If more than one crewmember is assigned to an API-5, 6, 8, B, and D position, only the pri-
   mary designated incumbent will be assigned an active FAC/FSC code and fly. The
   MAJCOM/SGPA or higher will determine which flight surgeons are designated as the
   primary incumbent.
4. If replacement of the primary incumbent is necessary (for example, PCS, permanent change
   of assignment, etc.), the replacement may also be authorized an active FAC/FSC code, pro-
   vided the overlap is not more than 30 days. (Reference paragraph 1.4.2.1.)
5. Qualified medical officers assigned to flight surgeon and pilot-physician, when not assigned
   to an operational flying squadron as a primary line flier, positions.
6. Officers/CEAs assigned to flying positions outside of USAF or duties requiring active flying
   with foreign services.
7. API 0 and Z identify non-rated/non-CEA positions.

2.3. Aviation Service Codes (ASC). ASCs are two-character codes that indicate incentive pay
entitlement and flying status. The first character of the ASC is the entitlement status code (ESC)
(Table 2.3and Table 2.4) and identifies Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP), Career Enlisted
Flyer Incentive Pay (CEFIP), or Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP) entitlement status. The
second character is the Flying Status Code (FSC) and identifies the current flying status. The
second character is numeric when the flier is disqualified or suspended (see Table 2.5) or an
alpha character for qualified individuals (see Table 2.6). Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2 indicate
ACIP and CEFIP entitlement status, respectively.

 Z Active-Remotely Pilot Aircraft (RPA) Duties. Pilot, navigator/CSO, ABM or CEAs
   (1AXXX or 1UXXX DAFSCs) assigned to an RPA approved by SecAF for OFDA credit
   and performing operational RPA duties.

NOTES:
1. The FSC indicates if a member is assigned to an active or inactive flying position and the
reason for inactivity. Rated members assigned to mandatory rated flying duties must fly in an
active status if otherwise qualified. If the unit commander determines that no flying support
capability exists for these officers, assign an inactive FSC. All rated aircrew members assigned
to non-flying duties or non-rated flying are restricted from active rated flying. MAJCOMs assign
support-flying priorities according to paragraph 2.7. when adequate resources are lacking.
2. ARMS automatically generates an FSC change for ASC G; no AO is required.
3. Do not process non-performance AOs (FSC S) for rated officers after 18 years of aviation
service or CEAs after 20 years of aviation service. Refer to AFIs 11-202, Vol 1, and 11-402
flying evaluation board requirement procedures, for members assigned to active flying positions
who do not fly for extended periods for reasons within their control.
4. HARM offices will process an AO to assign FSC P or R effective the date of the separation or
retirement orders, update ARMS, and terminate flight pay (if applicable). ARC members
entering a PAS Code starting with S7 will be assigned FSC P or FSC R upon effective date of
orders.
5. When nonrated/non-CEA members are assigned to a dual-coded flying/jump position, assign
FSC D. When no longer assigned to the dual-coded jump/flying position, change the member’s
FSC from D to J. When a member is re-assigned from a dual-coded position to a jump DAFSC
(or J prefixed position) only, change the member’s FSC to E.
2.4. Operational Flying Duty. Operational flying duty is flying duty performed under
competent orders while serving in assignments in which flying skills are maintained in the
performance of assigned duties. The FY 1996 National Defense Authorization Act established
current guidance for months of operational flying duty accumulation (OFDA) required for
entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay for specific years of aviation service. Current
legal authority is established in the US Code. Table 2.7 shows OFDA requirements.

Table 2.7. OFDA Requirements.

Note: Transition Status Codes were established to track the OFDA requirements for rated
officers affected by the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the Aviation Career Improvement
Act of 1989, and the FY 1996 National Defense Authorization Act. TSC A is assigned to all
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                               51


officers who had less than 6 years of aviation service on 1 October 1991. For additional TSC
guidance, reference instructions applicable when member’s aviation service date was
established. (Historic copies of AFI 11-401 are available from AF/A3O-AT.)


2.5. Rated Officer and Career Enlisted Aviator Operational Flying Duty. To control the
award of operational flying duty credit required by public law, HARM offices must assign active
operational fliers (FSC A) or ground-based radar duty (FSC B) who fail to perform flying or
ground-based radar duty to a temporary status, FSC S (Inactive-Nonperformance) IAW
paragraph 2.5.3.4 or 2.5.3.5. FSC S will remain valid until: the member accomplishes an OFDA-
creditable event; is disqualified for Aviation Service; or is reassigned to non-flying duty. Active
rated officers and CEAs recommended for DNIF are identified in ARMS by a physical
availability date and code. When the DNIF is expected to last more than 30 days or has lasted for
30 days, ARMS automatically reports the member on the Consolidated Headquarters Aviation
Resource Management System interface as FSC G. (The FSC G is for reporting purposes only.)
An AO change is not necessary. Members continue to accumulate OFDA credit until FSC S
applies.
   2.5.1. Operational event is flying or ground-based radar duty performed under competent
   orders by rated or designated members while serving in assignments in which basic flying
   skills are normally maintained in the performance of assigned duties as determined by the
   Secretary of the Air Force.
       2.5.1.1. Operational flying includes members in training that leads to the award of an
       aeronautical rating or designation. Rated officers and CEAs must attain and maintain, as
       a minimum, basic aircraft qualification in mission or support aircraft. One of the
       following indicates the need to fly:
           2.5.1.1.1. The assigned API code associated with a specific position.
           2.5.1.1.2. Assignment to a formal course of flying instruction.
           2.5.1.1.3. A case-by-case determination by AF/A3O-A when unusual circumstances
           dictate.
   2.5.2. The requirement for the Air Force to track the flying activity of rated members is
   based on public law. The FY 99 National Defense Authorization Act NDAA changed the
   way ACIP entitlement was computed for all rated officers. Previously, eligibility
   determination was based on the anniversary of the Officer Service Date (OSD). The FY 99
   NDAA changed eligibility determination to the anniversary of the ASD.
   2.5.3. OFDA Computations. To receive credit for a month of OFDA, an individual must:
       2.5.3.1. Be assigned to primary or corollary duties that require flying or ground-based
       radar duty and perform valid flying or ground-based radar duty which are authorized
       OFDA credit in the current month or preceding three months.
           2.5.3.1.1. After establishment of an ASD as an ABM and assigned to OFDA-
           creditable ground based radar duty will receive OFDA credit for those duties. ABMs
           must fly a minimum of six years (72 months) of aircraft-based operational flying duty
52                                                 AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


        accumulator (OFDA) credit by the 12th year of aviation service to be eligible for
        continuous ACIP beyond their 12 year gate.
     2.5.3.2. Be assigned to rated/CEA in-flight or similar RP duties while assigned FSC A,
     B, U, X, or Z for at least 15 days within each calendar month that earned OFDA credit
     from the current month or previous three months. Rated officers or CEA members
     assigned to an active flying billet pending a PCS assignment to an inactive billet should
     sign out from the losing base after the 15day of the month in order to receive OFDA
     credit for that month. They must have also performed OFDA-creditable flying within
     three months of the departure month.
     2.5.3.3. Have no more than 18 years of aviation service for rated officers and 20 years of
     aviation service for career enlisted aviators. Note: If required, members may accumulate
     badge-creditable OFDA months toward advanced rating criteria after the 18th or 20th
     year of aviation service. See AFI 11-402.
     2.5.3.4. Individuals initially assigned to flying duty (FSC A) or ground-based radar duty
     (FSC B), or returning to such duty from a disqualified or inactive status, other than FSC
     S, receive OFDA credit from the date of assignment of an active FSC. If such individuals
     do not fly within three months of that date, the HARM office will retroactively change
     the active FSC to FSC S, effective the day following the date of initial assignment of the
     active FSC. Deduct OFDA credit which began accruing with assignment of the original
     active FSC and terminate entitlement to OFDA credit. Assign an active FSC when flying
     or ground-based radar duty begins, effective two months before the date of the first flight.
     OFDA credit resumes from that date. Example: Captain Miller is assigned FSC A on 19
     December but first flies on 17 April: On 20 March, the HARM changes the FSC A to
     FSC S, effective 20 December. Captain Miller accumulated three months OFDA credit
     for January, February, and March. (Do not credit December because Capt Miller was
     assigned an active FSC for less than 15 days during that month.) The FSC S action
     deducts the three months credited and stops further accumulation. On 17 April, change
     the FSC S to FSC A, effective 17 February. This retroactive change restarts OFDA credit.
     Do not award OFDA credit for February (less than 15 days assigned), but award credit
     for March and April. Credit continues to accumulate until the individual fails to perform
     for a period greater than three months.
     2.5.3.5. When aircrew members who are actively flying prior to reaching 18 years (rated)
     and 20 years (CEA) of aviation service do not perform by the end of the third month
     following the month in which flying duties were last performed, change FSC to S
     effective the first day of the fourth month following the month in which flying duties
     were last performed and stop OFDA credit. Change the FSC to A again effective the date
     of the member‘s next OFDA-creditable flight. Do not award retroactive credit. Example:
     Lt Rochon flew on 14 May and did not fly again until 18 November: The HARM office
     assigns FSC S on 1 September. Credit OFDA for May, June, July, and August. The
     HARM office changes the FSC back to A on 18 November. There is no OFDA credit for
     November because the member was assigned FSC A for less than 15 days during that
     month. OFDA credit is not earned in September and October.
     2.5.3.6. Unit commanders will notify the servicing HARM office when an ABM
     assigned to OFDA-creditable ground based radar duties prior to reaching 18 years of
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                              53


       aviation service does not perform crew duties by the end of the third month following the
       month in which crew duties were last performed. HARM office personnel will change the
       member’s FSC to S effective the first day of the fourth month following the month in
       which crew duties were last performed and stop OFDA credit. Change the FSC to B
       effective the date the member resumes crew duties. Do not award retroactive credit.
2.6. OFDA Waivers. Operational flying duty requirements for officers and CEAs are
established by public law. IAW AFI 36-2110, Assignments, it is Air Force policy that as many
rated officers as possible complete at least 10 years (120 months) of operational flying by the
18th year of aviation service, however not all officers will fulfill the requirements to receive
ACIP through 25 years of aviation service. For CEAs, Air Force policy is to manage CEAs to
complete at least 9 years (108 months) of operational flying by the 15year of aviation service;
not all CEAs will fulfill the requirements to receive CEFIP through 25 years of aviation service.
The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) may waive OFDA requirements for rated officers and
CEAs who are unable to meet their flying requirements due to reasons beyond their control. Each
year, MAJCOM commanders may submit nominations for Lieutenant Colonels and below and
SMSgts and below to AF/A3O-AT, for Colonels (and selectees) to AF/DPO, and for CMSgts
(and selectees) to AF/DPE, for review and staffing to SECAF. To implement this program the
following procedures apply:
   2.6.1. Rated officers and CEAs are eligible for OFDA waiver consideration.
       2.6.1.1. Rated officer candidates must have at least 72 months (6 years) of OFDA credit
       to apply for a waiver.
       2.6.1.2. CEA candidates must accomplish at least 60 months (5 years) of operational
       flying during the first 10 years of aviation service, or 96 months (8 years) of operational
       flying duties during the first 15 years of aviation service to apply for a waiver.
       2.6.1.3. Officers and CEAs who have not accumulated the minimum number of months
       shown above are not eligible for waiver consideration.
       2.6.1.4. In addition to meeting established criteria in this section (paragraph 2.6), an
       ABM must have an established ASD and be eligible to receive ACIP.
       2.6.1.5. By direction of the SECAF, third gate waivers, for individuals to receive ACIP
       or CEFIP through 25 years of aviation service when OFDA requirements have not been
       met, will not be considered.
       2.6.1.6. Retroactive waivers may be approved for rated officers who obtain 72 months of
       OFDA credit after the 12th year of aviation service. Members will be authorized
       continuous entitlement to ACIP from the month in which they completed 72 months
       credit. (Members are not qualified for continuous entitlement prior to meeting
       qualification requirements.) Example: Major Standish reached her 12th year of aviation
       service on 18 January 09 and had accumulated 60 months of OFDA credit, 36 months
       short of the 12 year requirement, and was assigned ASC 5A, conditional entitlement
       status. Effective 17 January 10 she accumulated 72 months of OFDA and applied for a
       waiver of her 12th year requirement on that date. SECAF approved an OFDA waiver on
       15 June 10 and Major Standish’s HARM office was directed to publish an AO changing
       Major Standish’s ASC from 5A to 2A and start continuous ACIP effective 17 January 10.
       Note: CEAs are not eligible for retroactive waivers.
54                                                  AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


     2.6.1.7. For OFDA waiver requests submitted from the MAJCOM or equivalent, and
     approved by SECAF prior to loss of continuous pay, members will be authorized
     continuous entitlement to ACIP or CEFIP from the requirement anniversary date (if
     otherwise qualified).
     2.6.1.8. For OFDA waiver requests submitted from the MAJCOM or equivalent, and
     approved by SECAF after the loss of continuous pay, members will be authorized
     entitlement to ACIP or CEFIP from the date the member submitted the original request to
     the first office in the member’s MAJCOM or equivalent chain of command (if otherwise
     qualified).
  2.6.2. MAJCOM commanders may submit OFDA waiver nominations only when the
  member failed to achieve requirements due to reasons beyond his or her control. Examples
  include, but are not limited to: banked UPT graduates, extended DNIFs, rated officers
  assigned to deactivating/draw down flying units or Air Liaison Officer assignments who
  cannot be placed into another flying position prior to completion of 120 months of OFDA
  credit at 18 years of aviation service, rated officers assigned to non-flying duties necessary to
  comply with the requirements of the Goldwater-Nichols Act (joint duty schools/follow-on
  tours) or the Acquisition Public Law, and CEAs assigned to inactive flying billets to perform
  RPA sensor operator duties.
     2.6.2.1. Officers and CEAs selected for highly competitive and nominative assignments
     merit OFDA waiver consideration, when those assignments are specifically responsible
     for rated officers and CEAs failing to accomplish OFDA requirements. Should such
     assignments jeopardize the achievement of OFDA requirements, place appropriate
     documentation in the member’s personnel record. Documentation will include reasons
     why the member was assigned to a non-flying position (see paragraph 2.6.6).
     2.6.2.2. Waiver packages are considered on a case-by-case basis, to include objective
     and subjective assessment of the member’s request. Eligibility for waiver consideration
     does not ensure waiver approval.
  2.6.3. Rated officers receiving acquisition bonus monies may not be eligible for OFDA
  waivers.
  2.6.4. Months lost due to time spent under flying status code K (Inactive--lack of support) do
  not meet OFDA waiver criteria unless the officer or CEA was assigned to a unit undergoing
  draw down or conversion to an aircraft in which the individual’s specialty was not required,
  or when the unit aircraft was operationally grounded (paragraph 1.3.2). Individuals must
  meet both K code and draw down, conversion, or grounding criteria to be considered for a
  waiver. EXCEPTION: Members in active flying/ground-based radar assignments assigned
  flying status code K while deployed TDY to non-flying assignments IAW Table 2.6 are
  eligible for waiver consideration.
  2.6.5. Individuals who voluntarily turn down a flying opportunity or elect to move to a non-
  flying position which would preclude the possibility of meeting OFDA requirements are not
  eligible for OFDA waivers (except as may be provided for in paragraph 2.6.2.1).
     2.6.5.1. When an individual declines an opportunity to fly and is selected for a non-
     flying assignment, document this action in the member’s personnel record, as specified in
     paragraph 2.6.6 Reference the flying assignment that was declined.
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                         55


  2.6.6. AFPC, HQ USAF, or MAJCOM assignment officers, as applicable, will document
  situations that exist at the time of assignment which may preclude a member from meeting
  OFDA requirements, to establish an audit trail. (MAJCOMs will verify flying status code K
  criteria.) Documentation may be used to verify why OFDA waiver candidates were unable to
  accomplish OFDA requirements.
  2.6.7. MAJCOMs are responsible to ensure each individual eligible for an OFDA waiver is
  considered for a waiver.
     2.6.7.1. Submit OFDA waiver requests to the servicing HARM office no earlier than the
     year prior to loss of flight pay.
         2.6.7.1.1. HARM offices will staff requests to the MAJCOM.
         2.6.7.1.2. For members not assigned to an Air Force MAJCOM (i.e. members
         assigned to organizations such as USCENTCOM, USPACOM, or USSTRATCOM),
         individuals will submit packages to their servicing Air Force HARM office, which
         will staff packages to the MAJCOM that is in the HARM office’s chain of command.
         2.6.7.1.3. For members assigned to Headquarters, USAF, submit waivers through the
         individual’s supervisory chain of command (A1, A3, A4, etc.), then to A3O-AT,
         DPO, or DPE.
     2.6.7.2. HARM offices will review OFDA packages for accuracy, ensure all required
     items are included, and validate eligibility criteria IAW this instruction. For members
     assigned to Headquarters, USAF, members will provide required items (listed below).
     HAF members may contact the AF/A1 staff or AF/A3O-AT to validate eligibility for
     waiver consideration.
         2.6.7.2.1. OFDA waiver request packages will include the member’s dated request
         letter, Aviation Service Worksheet, justification for OFDA request, Military
         Personnel Data System duty history (SURF), and any other documents necessary to
         support justification.
         2.6.7.2.2. MAJCOMs will coordinate with AFPC (N/A for ARC personnel) to ensure
         support for packages when waivers are based on assignment actions. For HAF
         members, the AF/A1 staff will accomplish AFPC coordination.
         2.6.7.2.3. It is the responsibility of the member submitting the OFDA waiver request
         to establish adequate justification for waiver consideration.
  2.6.7.3. Packages forwarded to HAF for SECAF approval must contain MAJCOM/CC (or
  equivalent) or HAF (2-letter or equivalent in the member’s chain of command) indorsement.
  Forward OFDA waiver nominations for Lieutenant Colonels and below and SMSgts and
  below to AF/A3O-AT, for Colonels (and selectees) to HQ AF/DPO, and for CMSgts (and
  selectees) to AF/DPE. If submission is not warranted, MAJCOM commanders/equivalents or
  HAF senior officers may deny requests.
         2.6.7.3.1. Prior to MAJCOM commander/HAF senior officer approval,
         MAJCOM/HAF POCs may send OFDA waiver packages to AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO,
         or AF/DPE for an informal review; however, POCs will accomplish the initial review
         prior to submitting packages to HAF offices.
 56                                                  AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


   2.6.8. AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE will verify that packages meet eligibility criteria.
   AF/A3O-AT (or AF/DPO/DPE) and AF/A1 staff representatives will review packages. If all
   offices concur, nominations will be forwarded through the HAF chain of command to
   SECAF for consideration for an OFDA waiver. Packages that do not meet eligibility criteria
   will be returned to the MAJCOM. Waivers will be approved only for the minimum months
   required.
       2.6.8.1. Individuals who receive an OFDA waiver are not eligible for a second OFDA
       waiver. For individuals who receive waivers, the specific eligibility requirement is
       waived for the minimum extent necessary for that individual; members are not granted
       additional months of OFDA credit.
2.7. Taking Part in Flying by Rated Officers. Public law and DoD directives restrict active
rated flying to officers in positions that require members to maintain flying skills.
   2.7.1. Flying duties are assigned in the following precedence:
       2.7.1.1. API 1 or 2 officers assigned to support the weapon system crew ratio.
       2.7.1.2. Student officers assigned to a formal course of flying training.
       2.7.1.3. Officers assigned to positions coded API 6 or 8.
       2.7.1.4. Officers assigned to positions at MAJCOM or FOA level or below coded API 3
       or 4, or non-rated (API 0). Assign such officers to rated aircrew duties on the basis of the
       most recent aviation service date, if:
          2.7.1.4.1. The assignment provides at least 24 months of local flying availability (12
          months at short tour bases).
          2.7.1.4.2. The flying assignment is to an approved operational support mission
          specifically designated by HQ USAF.
       2.7.1.5. Rated officers will not perform flying duties during periods of non-flying TDY,
       permissive TDY, or while on leave. EXCEPTION: ARC members on terminal leave
       from active duty, who are otherwise eligible to fly, may perform flight duties.
       2.7.1.6. Officers (excluding the primary aircrew) accomplishing orientation flights fly in
       passenger status and will not perform flying duties.
   2.7.2. Special Circumstances.
       2.7.2.1. If special circumstances require active temporary operational flying that is not
       IAW paragraph 2.7.1, MAJCOM/A3 may approve exceptions on an individual case basis
       (FAC 6/E waiver). See Table 2.2
       2.7.2.2. If special circumstances require rated officers to perform temporary in-flight
       non-rated or non-crew (operational support) duties, HARM offices will assign FAC 8.
       For rated officers who were in inactive status, publish an AO assigning FAC 8, FSC J,
       and include in the remarks section of AO: “Rated Officer assigned to perform in-flight
       non-rated (or non-crew) duties.” Officers performing non-rated duties will log aircrew
       certification code Z on the AFTO Form 781; flight time does not count towards OFDA or
       ACIP entitlement.
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                              57


   2.7.3. Do not assign active flying duties to members scheduled for an academic instruction
   course of 180 days or longer. The HARM office will assign FSC L to these members. (See
   also Table 2.6.)
   2.7.4. Reserve officers not on extended active duty (EAD) may be assigned to inactive rated
   positions (API 3 or API 4).
      2.7.4.1. Send requests for removing Reservists from flying to AFRC/A3TB (with copies
      to AF/REO and AF/A3O-AT) for approval.
      2.7.4.2. Send requests for removing ANG personnel from flying to NGB/CF (with a
      copy to AF/A3O-AT) for approval.
   2.7.5. Rated officers assigned to API 0 billets may fly on a non-interference basis when
   required. Incentive pay and OFDA credit are not authorized for non-interference flying.
   Members will not log flying time on the AFTO form 781. (See also paragraph 2.10.4).
2.8. Flight Surgeon, Pilot-Physician, and Critical Care Air Transport Team Flying Policy.
   2.8.1. To be assigned to active flying status, a flight surgeon must be medically qualified,
   physiologically qualified (if applicable), and maintain flight medicine credentials. To receive
   conditional ACIP, active flight surgeons must be assigned to an API 5 unit manpower
   document (UMD) position with Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC) 48XX, or 40C0C
   with an additional AFSC of 48XX, be on active flying status AOs, and be qualified in the
   aircraft. IAW DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 7a, Military Pay Policy and Procedures -
   Active Duty and Reserve Pay, flight surgeons are conditional fliers and qualify for
   entitlement to conditional ACIP by completing the prescribed number of operational flying
   hours per month.
      2.8.1.1. Commanders may authorize inactive flight surgeons to fly and log time without
      ACIP on a noninterference basis with unit training and flying schedules. Flight surgeons
      not qualified in an aircraft, on inactive AOs, will log only “Other” flight time and include
      remarks on the reverse side of AFTO Form 781 (for example, “Inactive flight surgeon,”
      or “Flight surgeon not qualified in aircraft”). Paragraphs 2.14.3 and 2.14.5 apply.
      2.8.1.2. When a flight surgeon is assigned to an API 0 position, the HARM office will
      terminate active flying AOs and assign the member ASC 8J. Paragraph 2.14.7 applies.
   2.8.2. A flight surgeon possessing an additional pilot or navigator rating and assigned to an
   API 5 flight surgeon position flies only as a flight surgeon, unless selected and approved as a
   pilot-physician or navigator-physician IAW AFI 11-405, The Pilot-Physician Program.
   Pilot-physicians/navigator-physicians assigned to active flying positions (API 1/2) fly as line
   pilots/navigators. AF/A3/5 authorizes exceptions upon request, based on justification
   provided by the Surgeon General (AF/SG). Flight surgeons who hold valid pilot or navigator
   ratings are entitled to conditional ACIP only; OFDA credit is not authorized, even when
   members are assigned to API 1/2 positions.
   2.8.3. Pilot-Physicians Procedures. AFI 11-405 prescribes procedures for the US Air
   Force Pilot-Physician Program. Pilot-physicians remain conditional fliers for ACIP
   entitlement and do not earn OFDA credit. Except as noted above, active flying pilot-
   physicians will be assigned ASC 8A, FAC 9, and API 5, and hold DAFSC 48VX. Retain
   members in ASC 8 beyond 25 years of aviation service. Credit flight time logged as a pilot
 58                                                 AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


   towards advanced pilot and flight surgeon ratings (only when member is assigned FAC 9)
   and ACIP entitlement.
   2.8.4. Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATT) Procedures. Active and inactive
   flight surgeons may be tasked to assist CCATTs with patients on a mission.
      2.8.4.1. Active flight surgeons assigned to API 5 positions, with ASC 8A, are authorized
      to log crew position “FS” and primary time on all USAF aircraft missions based on their
      aircraft qualification.
      2.8.4.2. Inactive flight surgeons assigned to API 0 positions, in ASC 8J and tasked to
      perform CCATT non-crew duties, are authorized to log “FZ” crew position and primary
      time on these missions. Flight time may only be logged when critical care patients are
      onboard. When authorized, the member’s HARM office will process the operational
      support AO. Assign FAC 8, and include AO remarks: “Rated officer tasked to perform
      CCATT non-crew FAC 8 duties. Crew position FZ and non-crew HDIP authorized.” The
      member’s ASC remains ASC 8J.
   2.8.5. Flight surgeons, pilot-physicians, and CCATT personnel will not perform flying
   duties during periods of non-flying TDY, permissive TDY, or while on leave.
   EXCEPTION: ARC members on terminal leave from active duty, who are otherwise eligible
   to fly, may perform flight duties.
   2.8.6. Members accomplishing orientation flights fly in passenger status and will not
   perform flying duties.
2.9. Taking Part in Flying by Career Enlisted Aviators.
   2.9.1. Flying duties are assigned in the following precedence:
      2.9.1.1. API A or B CEAs assigned to support the weapon system crew ratio, flying
      training instruction duty, operational test and evaluation functions, Foreign Military Sales
      (FMS), etc.
      2.9.1.2. Students assigned to a formal course of flying training.
      2.9.1.3. Career enlisted aviators assigned to positions coded API B or D.
      2.9.1.4. Career enlisted aviators assigned to positions at MAJCOM or FOA level or
      below coded API C or E. Assign career enlisted aviators API C or E aircrew duties on the
      basis of the most recent aviation service and be careful not to cause the member to fall
      short of meeting OFDA credit.
   2.9.2. Do not assign active flying duties to members who are scheduled for an academic
   instruction course of 180 days or more.
   2.9.3. Career enlisted aviators will not perform flying duties during periods of non-flying
   TDY, permissive TDY, or while on leave. EXCEPTION: ARC members on terminal leave

AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                              59


  2.9.6. CEAs assigned to API-Z billets may fly on a non-interference basis when required.
  Incentive pay and OFDA credit are not authorized for non-interference flying. Members will
  not log flying time on the AFTO Form 781. (See also paragraph 2.10.4).
2.10. Taking Part in Flying by Non-rated Officer Aircrew Members and Non-CEA
Enlisted Aircrew Members.
  2.10.1. Non-rated officer and non-CEA enlisted aircrew members (FSC D) are qualified
  personnel assigned to designated aircrew positions. Non-rated/non-CEA aircrew members
  are included onboard aircraft when their presence is required for the aircraft to accomplish its
  primary tasked mission. This is their full-time duty. When a full-time presence is not
  required, operational support flying may be applicable (see paragraph 2.10.2). Non-
  rated/non-CEA aircrew members will maintain flying class III physicals.
     2.10.1.1. Non-CEA enlisted aircrew members require an aircrew prefix of X (Basic
     Aircrew), K (Instructor), or Q (Evaluator).
     2.10.1.2. Non-rated officer aircrew members may be assigned to duty positions with an
     AFSC prefix of X (Basic Aircrew), B (Squadron Operations Officer), C (Commander), F
     (Flight Test), K (Instructor), or Q (Evaluator).
         2.10.1.2.1. When a non-rated officer aircrew member and/or parachutist is assigned
         to an authorized X or J (Jump) prefixed UMD position which is also a Commander (C
         prefix) or a Squadron Operations Officer (B prefix) position, the C/B prefix does not
         remove the authorization to fly or jump. Place the following remark on the
         individual’s AO: “Member occupies an X (or J) prefix UMD position.”
         2.10.1.2.2. FSC J (Inactive) or L (TDY School) identifies aircrew members not
         assigned to active flying positions. AOs terminate authorization to fly and entitlement
         to incentive pay.
  2.10.2. FSC C (Operational Support) identifies non-rated/non-CEA personnel required to
  perform essential inflight duties that cannot be accomplished by rated officers, CEAs or non-
  rated aircrew members. Operational Support fliers may be required to perform flight duties
  on an occasional basis. However, their assigned full-time duties do not require them to be
  onboard the aircraft to accomplish its assigned primary mission. When the requirement to fly
  terminates, flight record responsibility ends. Authorized man-months are required prior to
  issuance of AOs. Process requests for operational support flying IAW AFI 11-402.
  2.10.3. Aerospace physiologists (DAFSC 43AX), Human Performance Training Teams
  (DAFSC 4M0X1), and non-aircrew aerospace medicine personnel(DAFSCs 42GX and
  4N0XXs) are authorized to participate in aircraft flights as observers on a noninterference
  basis. HARM offices will publish AOs according to this instruction and MAJCOM
  directives. Neither ACIP entitlement nor OFDA credit are authorized. Personnel who provide
  high altitude airdrop mission support qualify for Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP).
  Paragraphs 2.14.3 and 2.14.5 apply. Personnel who fly in support of high altitude airdrop
  missions will comply with AFI 11-402.
  2.10.3. (PACAF) Aerospace physiologists (DAFSC 43AX) and Human Performance
  Training Teams (DAFSC 4M0X1) will have a letter authorizing them Non-Interference
  Flying in PACAF signed by the WG/CC.
60                                                 AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


  2.10.4. Other non-rated/non-CEA personnel who fly occasionally to perform specific tasks
  (e.g., administrative duties, evaluation of equipment, maintenance, passenger escort, security
  for classified documents, crew chiefs who perform duties on the ground at the final
  destination or points enroute and other duties not authorized as operational support IAW AFI
  11-402) may have AOs published according to this instruction and MAJCOM directives.
  Individuals in these categories will fly on a non-interference basis. Neither flying incentive
  pay nor OFDA credit is authorized. Paragraphs 2.14.3 and 2.14.5 apply.
     2.10.4.1. Members who fly on non-interference AOs will not be placed on the AFTO
     Form 781 (see paragraph 1.6.2.2), except for those members specified in paragraph
     3.2.1.5.2
     2.10.4.2. Non-Aircrew personnel who fly occasionally to obtain familiarity with the
     flying environment or directed to perform specific inflight duties on an infrequent or
     irregular basis (Commanders [including unit commanders], Operations Officers, and
     supervisory personnel) may do so under the guidelines of paragraph 1.6 Non-aircrew
     members assigned to flying unit commander positions may log flying time IAW
     paragraph 3.2.1.5.2
     2.10.4.3. (Added-PACAF) In PACAF, the flying category “other non-rated member” is
     not to be used for the convenience of transporting individuals TDY or as a substitute for
     the orientation flight program. Examples of members who may fly in this status in
     PACAF aircraft may be SERE Specialist supporting personnel recovery/CSAR activities,
     intelligence personnel, operations group or command chief master sergeants and first
     sergeant of flying unit/group who fly frequently with their units to obtain/maintain
     familiarity of their flying environment and of their unit members. Individuals not
     meeting the criteria above will not be placed on aeronautical orders.
     2.10.4.4. (Added-PACAF) OG/CC will identify in writing the individuals to place on
     AOs. OG/CC will validate the requirement to fly annually and the AO will not exceed 12
     months.
     2.10.4.5. (Added-PACAF) For NAF and HQ PACAF personnel, Non-Interference
     Flying will be used for established categories of individuals only. These groups must
     submit a plan outlining their need to be on the aircraft, complete with objectives and
     expectations. Submit your proposed plan to HQ PACAF/A3T, 25 E. ST SUITE G320,
     JBPH-H, HI 96853-5426 for approval, prior to requesting non-interference AOs.
  2.10.5. Aircrew members not formally entered into Initial Qualification Training will fly
  under orientation flight guidelines for familiarization flights IAW paragraph 1.9.4.7.1.2
  2.10.6. Members will not perform flying duties during periods of non-flying TDY,
  permissive TDY, or while on leave. EXCEPTION: ARC members on terminal leave from
  active duty, who are otherwise eligible to fly, may perform flight duties.
  2.10.7. Members participating in orientation flights fly in passenger status and will not
  perform flying duties.
  2.10.8. (Added-PACAF) The HARM is required to submit a letter/E-mail to PACAF/SG,
  with an info copy to PACAF/A3TC, each time an active flight surgeon exceeds the 60-day
  flight currency. Flight Surgeons exceeding their 60-day flight currency will be required to
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                             61


   re-accomplish the flight surgeon qualification examination. Failure to accomplish the flight
   surgeon qualification examination will result in a go-no-go violation, and refusal to be
   allowed to fly. HARM/SARM offices will develop local procedures to track this
   requirement.
       2.10.8.1. (Added-PACAF) For Flight Surgeons remaining non-current for more than 30
       days, the HARM will submit a follow-up notification, at the end of each month, to the
       original addressees as well as the individual’s unit commander, OG/CC (or equivalent)
       and MDG/CC.

Section 2B—Supervisory Operational Flying Positions

2.11. Supervisory Position Criteria. To conserve available resources, clearly identify rated
officers and CEA supervisory positions (API 6, 8, B, or D) that require the incumbent to actively
fly.
2.12. Supervisory Flying.
   2.12.1. Rated officer and CEA supervisory flying is necessary to ensure that appropriate
   rated staff officers maintain a current and comprehensive background in the overall flying
   operations of the organization.
   2.12.2. Perform supervisory flying to the maximum extent possible in primary mission
   aircraft inventory (PMAI) associated with the position.
   2.12.3. Commanders (including unit commanders) authorized to designate rated and CEA
   supervisory positions must minimize the impact of such flying and designate API 6, 8, B, or
   D positions only when active flying is essential for mission accomplishment. Designating
   authorities are:
       2.12.3.1. General Officer. The Chief of Staff designates general officer operational
       flying positions. Requests for a change of general officer flying status will be submitted
       to AF/A3/5. AF/A3/5 will coordinate changes with AF/DPG. All requests for general
       officer operational flying training must be coordinated with AF/DPG. See Table 2.8 for
       general officer flying authorizations. See paragraph 2.14.1 and Table 2.9 for additional
       guidance on general officer indoctrination fliers.
       2.12.3.2. Colonel. MAJCOMs designate colonel active flying positions (API 6/8) by
       forwarding AF Form 480, Aircrew AFSC/Active Flying Justification, to AF/DPO for
       review and approval (see AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower Requirements). Colonel
       flying positions will be limited to individuals who directly supervise aircraft flying
       operations, flight safety, standardization/evaluation programs, and operational readiness
       inspection programs. Should positions not warrant full time flying, there may be
       justification for the individual to participate in the indoctrination flying program.
       2.12.3.3. Lieutenant Colonel and Below. MAJCOMs designate Lt Colonel-and-below
       rated officer and CEA positions that require active flying IAW AFI 38-201. If the
       position requires an AF Form 480, provide justification for flying on the form. Normally,
       API 8/D positions (NAF/FOA/DRU/MAJCOM) are authorized only in safety, inspector
       general, and standardization/evaluation functional areas in which flying is a requirement
 62                                                 AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


       associated with the position. On occasion, justification may exist for an aircrew member
       to fly while in inactive status; see paragraph 2.14

Table 2.8. General Officer Flying Positions.
The following general officer positions are authorized operational or indoctrination flying
positions (as shown) when filled by USAF general officers. Individuals flying operationally
must accomplish Form 8 qualification to include instrument qualification and must
maintain a minimum of BAQ status.

NOTES:
1. Combatant Commanders may determine their flying status, based on requirements. Notify
AF/A3/5 of status, with info copy to AF/A3O-AT and AF/DPG.
2. The Chief of Staff will determine the status of the AF/CC position.
3. MAJCOMs may determine the flying status of general officers assigned within their
command, utilizing the available AF/CC-approved operational positions within the command.
This option applies to all approved operational flying positions above wing commander. Current
approved positions are shown in Table 2.8 with most recent HAF authorized status (Note: May
not reflect actual status if a MAJCOM change has been made). If a change is made, notify
AF/A3/5 with an info copy to AF/A3O-AT and AF/DPG.
4. Wing Commander applies to commanders of flying wings (and includes expeditionary flying
wings). Air base and support wing commanders are specifically excluded.
5. Current list of approved general officer operational flying positions is maintained on file in
AF/A3O-AT. AF/A3O-AT maintains records of approval for all general officer operational
flying positions.
6. Individuals in authorized O-6 operational flying positions who have been selected for
promotion to the grade of Brigadier General may continue to fly operationally while assigned to
the O-6 flying position.
2.13. Supervisory Position Limitations. MAJCOMs will establish procedures to review API
6, 8, B, and D supervisory flying positions when incumbents are assigned FSC K (lack of
support) and when adequate support will not be available within six months. Where practical,
convert such positions to API 3, 4, C or E.
   2.13.1. (Added-PACAF) Rated supervisors. Defined as commanders (including unit
   commanders)/key supervisors (OG/CD, unit DO) (API 6 and 8) are authorized to perform
   aircrew duties in any aircraft under their control for the purpose of supervising or observing
   flying training programs. Additionally, OG Superintendents who are on aeronautical orders,
   are current and qualified in an aircraft and assigned to a base with CEA/multi crew aircraft
   may fly under this paragraph. AFI 11-401, paragraph 3.7.1., also applies.
       2.13.1.1. (Added-PACAF) With the exception of COMPACAF, rated supervisors
       unqualified in fighter aircraft will not fly in the front seat of the aircraft.
       2.13.1.2. (Added-PACAF) Mobility and rotary-wing aircraft:               Rated supervisors
       unqualified in the aircraft are authorized to fly a primary crew position but must meet the
       following criteria:
           2.13.1.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Fly with an IP, and a complete crew complement.
           2.13.1.2.2. (Added-PACAF) Attend a senior officer orientation course. If one
           doesn’t exist receive in-unit aircraft familiarization training, and complete all required
           Aircrew Flight Equipment training for that aircraft.
           2.13.1.2.3. (Added-PACAF) OG Superintendents will not fly in a primary crew
           position on any aircraft they are not qualified in.
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                              65


   2.13.2. (Added-PACAF) Submit all Authorization Change Requests (ACRs) for API 3, 4, 6
   and 8 positions to Manpower and Organization Division (HQ PACAF/A1M), 25 E. ST
   SUITE F-214, JBPH-H, HI 96853, and coordinate through HQ PACAF/A3T and appropriate
   NAF for review. An AF Form 480 must accompany these ACRs and fully justifying rated
   expertise in supervisory positions. Base active (API 6/8) or inactive (API 3/4) flying status
   solely on job requirements, not on individual needs or aircraft support capability.
2.14. Indoctrination Flying. Rated officers and CEAs in inactive status who are required to
perform operational flying on a temporary basis to complete a specific official task (for example,
to evaluate an operational flying procedure, review flying training effectiveness, take part in a
flying exercise or test program, or become familiar with a specific operational weapon system
and procedure) may be authorized indoctrination flying status. The following policy applies:
   2.14.1. MAJCOMs (or MAJCOM equivalents) select and authorize rated staff and CEA
   positions for indoctrination flying. Indoctrination flying allows inflight observations of
   mission equipment or procedures that will benefit the organization. Incumbents must request
   to fly. Take a conservative approach in designating these positions. MAJCOMs (or
   MAJCOM equivalents) will establish procedures for approval of indoctrination flying in
   accordance with Table 2.9 MAJCOMs will identify the incumbent by assigning FSC T.
   MAJCOMs may not increase the number of general officer indoctrination fliers without
   AF/CC approval.
   2.14.2. MAJCOM commanders must approve the use of command aircraft resources to
   support indoctrination flying for personnel outside their commands. Authorization may be
   delegated, but not lower than MAJCOM level.
   2.14.3. MAJCOMs must ensure individuals complete, before flight, adequate training on
   emergency procedures, life support equipment, and aircraft systems. Individuals must be
   physically and, where required, physiologically qualified.
   2.14.3. (PACAF) 1 (Added) Prior to flight, all indoctrination fliers will complete
   orientation flight Aircrew Flight Equipment training according to AFI 11-301, Vol 1.,
   PACAF Sup 1, Aircrew Flight Equipment Program, and cockpit familiarization training.
   Indoctrination flyers will occupy the jump seat, additional crew member seats or the rear
   cock pit position. PACAF/A3/5 is the approval authority to allow indoctrination flyers to fly
   in a pilot position. Approved flyers must accomplish a Bold Face/Critical Action Procedures
   (CAP) test (if applicable) and situational emergency procedures training (SEPT) with an
   instructor pilot as established in the applicable training directives. A cockpit procedural
   trainer or in-cockpit review session may be substituted for the simulator. This training is
   valid for 30 days.
   2.14.4. Indoctrination flights in inactive status do not entitle the member to OFDA credit or
   incentive pay and do not allow authority to change ASCs except to assign FSC T.
   MAJCOMs will ensure indoctrination flying does not impact unit training, and will not
   increase command flying hour allocations.
       2.14.4.1. (Added-PACAF) In PACAF, due to limited crewmember training
       opportunities and flying hours, it is essential for commanders to personally review each
       request to ensure it is in the best interest of the command. Forward requests for
       indoctrination flying, with supporting rationale, through appropriate channels. See
 66                                                AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


      attachment 10. PACAF units submit request to HQ PACAF/A3T, 25 E. ST SUITE G-
      317, JBPH-H, HI 96853-5426, through the NAF/A3. PACOM units submit requests to
      HQ PACAF/A3/5, through HQ USPACOM/J3. Incumbents of indoctrination flying
      positions not within PACAF or those above NAF level request indoctrination support
      through the appropriate NAF/A3. Individuals at NAF level may fly in other than NAF
      assigned aircraft with the concurrence of the NAF commander concerned. Individuals at
      wing level will fly in wing assigned aircraft only (HQ PACAF/A3T may approve
      exceptions on a case-by-case basis). Requests will be forwarded through channels to
      arrive at HQ PACAF/A3T, 25 E. ST SUITE G-317, JBPH-H, HI 96853-5426, at least 30
      days prior to first flight. The HARM will not assign FSC “T” to an inactive flyer without
      written approval from PACAF/A3/5.
   2.14.5. Obtaining or maintaining aircraft qualification while in inactive status is not
   authorized. Individuals flying in inactive status may not act as pilot in command and flights
   in single-place aircraft are specifically prohibited. Document indoctrination flights on the
   AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document using Other flight time,
   IAW paragraph 3.3.5
      2.14.5.1. IAW paragraph 1.12.4.3, general officer pilots in authorized indoctrination
      flying positions may occupy a pilot’s seat with passengers or MEP on board during non-
      critical phases of flight. During such times a current and qualified instructor pilot will
      occupy the other pilot’s seat. See AFI 11-202, Volume 3, for definition of critical phases
      of flight.
   2.14.6. MAJCOMs may authorize indoctrination flying for individuals assigned to active
   operational flying positions. Do not change FSC.
   2.14.7. Indoctrination flying is not authorized for individuals assigned to API 0 or Z coded
   positions. EXCEPTION: MAJCOMs may authorize indoctrination flying for CEAs assigned
   to 9G100 positions, and for individuals tasked to perform indoctrination flying duties while
   deployed.

   2.14.9. (Added-PACAF) General officers who perform rated and Airborne Emergency
   Action Officer (AEAO) duties on a flight will use the two flight authorizations duty codes
   reflecting the flight time performed in each position (rated/non-crew). For rated duties, log
   flight authorization duty character code IAW AFI 11-401, Table A2.3. that indicates the
   general’s flying status. For AEAO duties log the flight authorization duty “FZ”.
2.15. Operational Support Aircraft (OSA) and Aircrew Management.
   2.15.1. The operational support aircraft and aircrew manager will provide all personnel
   assigned or attached for flying the opportunity to complete annual flying requirements.
   Attached personnel must be responsive to scheduling requirements. In line with aircrew
   requirements, attached personnel will perform assigned missions.
   2.15.2. If TDY is authorized solely to perform aircrew duties, budgeting and funding for
   TDY travel of aircrew members assigned or attached for flying is the responsibility of the
   unit to which the aircrew member is assigned.
   2.15.3. Security Assistance and Defense Attaché aircraft and aircrews.

       loan to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
       2.15.3.3. Using organizations must comply with the theater air component
       command/lead command rules and instructions that pertain to aircraft operations. Crew
       qualification, currency, training, and evaluations are the responsibility of the theater air
       component/lead command commander, as applicable, and will be conducted according to
       HQ USAF guidance and theater requirements. Operational control (as it pertains to the
       missions and purposes for which the aircraft are operated) and scheduling of aircraft
       remains within the using organization.

Section 2C—Support of Personnel Assigned to Locations or Organizations Lacking Flying
Facilities or Aircraft

2.16. Attachment for Flying/Parachuting.
   2.16.1. Aircrew/parachutist members assigned by PCS/PCA orders to active
   flying/parachutist positions in US Air Force units and organizations without flying facilities
   or aircraft may be attached for flying/parachuting to units with appropriate resources. Intra-
68                                                   AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


  wing attachments may be approved by the OG/CC. Individuals must request (in writing)
  attachment for flying/jumping through their chain of command to their MAJCOM or
  equivalent. (EXCEPTION: Request for attachment for flying/parachuting is not required if
  flying/parachuting support and a primary unit/aircraft is addressed in a host-tenant
  agreement. Members will provide required information to the servicing HARM office.)
  Approval authority may be delegated as directed by MAJCOMs.
  2.16.1. (PACAF) All aircrew/parachutist in PACAF assigned to an active flying/parachutist
  position without flying facilities or aircraft will be attached to a flying/jumping unit that will
  track their flying/jump requirements. HQ PACAF/A3/5 has delegated final approval
  authority for all attachments for flying/jumping within PACAF to PACAF/A3T and it is the
  A3T’s responsibility to equitably distribute all attached flyers/jumpers throughout the
  command. Attachment for flying/jumping requests must be accomplished in writing by the
  individual requesting attachment IAW Attachment 7 of this supplement. It is the
  responsibility of the requesting individual to pre-coordinate with the prospective unit of
  attachment. Submit formal requests through the individual’s commander, to the requested
  unit training office, for endorsement by the requested unit commander. Obtain the
  concurrence of the OG prior to submission to HQ PACAF. Requests can be submitted
  electronically to expedite the approval process. Scan and attach the following documents
  (current Aeronautical Order (AO), AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendations for Flying or
  Special Operational Duty, UMPR, Individual Data Summary and Individual Training
  Summary). Forward requested unit recommendations for approval, or rational for
  disapproval, to HQ PACAF/A3T. No flights/jumps will take place until the request has been
  approved. HQ PACAF/A3T will send an information copy of the approved request to the
  individual, the attached unit, and the assigned HARM who will maintain the approved
  request in the member’s FRF throughout the individual’s tenure of attachment. Flight record
  folders for O-5s and below will be maintained at the servicing HARM for the attached unit.
  Flight record folders for O-6 and above will be maintained at the HARM at their actual duty
  location. The HARM who owns the FRF will notify HQ PACAF/A3T and the unit of
  attachment when the individual is no longer attached for flying/jumping.
     2.16.1.1. Request for attachment must include: Individual’s name, rank, Social Security
     Number (SSN), aviation service date (ASD), aviation service code (ASC), aeronautical
     rating (or badge), expected duration of attachment, date of separation (DOS)/expiration
     of term of service (ETS), assigned duty position title/position number/API code, aircraft
     last qualified in, date last flown, current AO, current AF Form 1042, and requested unit
     of attachment and point of contact. (Parachutists need only provide information
     applicable to parachuting.) Individuals should coordinate flying/parachute qualification,
     currency and attachment with requested units prior to submitting formal request.
     2.16.1.1. (PACAF) Cross-command attachments must be coordinated by the requesting
     member’s MAJCOM prior to arriving at HQ PACAF/A3TC. Additionally, PACAF/A3T
     must coordinate on PACAF flyers seeking attachment to another MAJCOM’s flying unit
     prior to the request being sent to that MAJCOM. PACAF/A3T is the final approval
     authority for flyers and jumpers from other MAJCOM’s attaching to a PACAF unit.
     EXCEPTION: Flight surgeons of other commands, in valid API 5 positions, may be
     attached to PACAF units without memorandums of attachment provided such support is
     addressed in a memorandum of agreement between the flight surgeon’s base/command
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                             69


      and the PACAF unit owning the aircraft. All such memorandums of attachment will be
      forwarded to HQ PACAF/A3TC and kept on file. Memorandums of attachment are re-
      accomplished every 36 months or upon reassignment (PCS/PCA) (this includes when the
      unit of attachment deactivates), whichever is earliest.
      2.16.1.2. MAJCOMs will develop procedures for attachments within the MAJCOM. For
      attachments outside an individual’s MAJCOM, submit the request to both MAJCOMs (or
      equivalent) for coordination. For attachments outside the USAF, submit the request to the
      gaining unit’s MAJCOM equivalent approval authority and the individual’s parent
      MAJCOM (or equivalent) approval authority for coordination.
   2.16.2. Attachment units will provide resources necessary for the member to complete and
   maintain minimum training requirements established in applicable aircrew/parachutist
   training publications, including TDY cost to formal training courses. The unit to which the
   member is assigned is responsible for cost of the member’s TDY travel to the attached unit to
   accomplish normal training requirements. The attached unit will maintain the FEF.
   2.16.3. (Added-PACAF) API 5/6/B individuals assigned to units falling within or under the
   same OG (i.e., the OSS), do not require formal attachment for flying when flying with other
   units within the group.
   2.16.4. (Added-PACAF) Units of attachment, or other units having a legitimate need to
   access another location’s ARMS database, may do so by contacting that HARM Chief of
   assignment and requesting access. User access will be limited to the minimum level required
   to affect the inquiry/update of the required records.

Section 2D—Flying with Air Reserve Component Units

2.17. Total Force Absorption Program (TFAP) In addition to the guidance provided in this
section, aircrew personnel must comply with Total Force Absorption Program (TFAP)
guidance contained in AFI 11-412.
2.18. Flying With AFRC Units.
   2.18.1. Members of the MAJCOM with oversight responsibility are authorized to fly in
   AFRC aircraft when participating in operational readiness inspections (ORIs), aircrew
   standardization and evaluation visits (ASEVs) and higher headquarters evaluation teams on
   scheduled unit visits. Flying is restricted to missions that support unit training objectives,
   contingencies or operational missions, to include those that augment or assist in unit
   conversion.
   2.18.2. Inter-Fly. AFRC operations group commanders are authorized to approve flights
   with AFRC units for aircrew members not assigned or attached to an AFRC unit and are the
   final authority for determining when an active duty/Air National Guard member may fly unit
   aircraft. Such aircrew members must provide operations group commanders with a source for
   validating aircrew qualifications, training and currencies prior to flying. AFRC OG/CCs will
   forward information copies of interfly agreements to the respective NAF/A3. EXCEPTION:
   Those units with an existing written agreement, e.g. TFI/associate units, will follow guidance
   within the agreement.
 70                                                AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


      2.18.2.1. Interfly agreements may involve the exchange and/or substitution of aircrew
      members and/or aircraft between different MAJCOM units to accomplish flying in
      support of contingencies, exercises or designated missions according to the appropriate
      OPLAN/CONOPS.
      2.18.2.2. During situations where interfly may be an option, aircraft ownership does not
      change. Aircraft hours executed will be credited to the command and unit of assignment
      of the aircraft regardless of the crews MAJCOM affiliation. Ensure use of correct mission
      symbol.
      2.18.2.3. As a minimum, interfly crewmembers will be qualified/certified in the MDS
      and model as well as system/configuration required to fly the aircraft and/or mission.
2.19. Flying With ANG Units.
   2.19.1. The ANG Wing Commander must concur on all active duty flying with ANG units.
   Flying is restricted to Air Force advisors and aircrews who support unit training objectives,
   contingencies, or operational missions to include aircrew that inspect, standardize, augment,
   or assist in unit conversion. (Individuals will not be listed on the ANG web page since they
   are not formally attached to an ANG unit for the purpose of obtaining continuation training.)
   With the deployed commander’s concurrence, active duty aircrew attached to Air Warrior,
   Combat Archer and Combat Hammer are authorized to fly with ANG units.
   2.19.2. Active duty flying with ANG units for the sole purpose of continuation training (CT)
   is prohibited without approval from the ANG Director of Operations (NGB/A3). (Future
   Total Force [FTF] wings will coordinate active duty CT flying IAW the MAJCOM
   CONOPS). Forward all requests for active duty CT flying support to NGB/A3 with
   appropriate ANG Wing Commander and MAJCOM/A3 concurrence. Requests must include:
   name, rank, office symbol (e.g., 9 AF/DOV), primary aircraft MDS (e.g., F-16C, C-130E),
   aircrew position (e.g., IP, IN), and reason for requested CT support. A complete list of AD
   aircrew approved to fly CT sorties with the ANG is available on the NGB/A3O Portal.
   2.19.3. Active duty aircrew members authorized to fly ANG aircraft in accordance with
   paragraphs 2.18.2 and 2.19.2 may coordinate sortie support directly with the unit. Members
   must provide the supporting unit operations group commander with a source for verifying
   currencies, egress training, flight qualification, etc., before flying. The supporting unit
   operations group commander is the final authority for determining when active duty aircrew
   may fly unit aircraft.
   2.19.4. Conduct flying in accordance with applicable US Air Force, lead MAJCOM, and
   ANG instructions.
2.20. Coordination Authorization. Direct communication with MAJCOMs, AFRC, and ANG
concerning attachment of rated personnel is authorized.
2.21. TFI and Associate Units.
   2.21.1. For TFI units, there are two separate and distinctly funded flying hour programs. The
   unit to which the aircraft are assigned has responsibility for oversight and management of
   both programs.
   2.21.2. TFI and Associate units are to use their respective command’s mission symbols
   regardless of crew status (Active/ANG/Reserve).
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                             71


2.22. (Added-PACAF) The SARM: is ultimately responsible to ensure the unit’s ARMS
database is accurate at all times. Aircrew upgrade data will not be entered in ARMs without a
certified source document (AF Form 4324).
   2.22.1. (Added-PACAF) The SARM will ensure go-no-go procedures are performed
   before each flight to include all grounding items, flight currencies, and current aeronautical
   orders.
   2.22.2. (Added-PACAF) Following each flight, the SARM will establish procedures to
   monitor and audit the accuracy and legibility of all training documentation before processing.
   Use this mission review process to ensure the accuracy of the ARMS database. Further
   verify and audit all documentation used to record training accomplishments against the
   AFTO Form 781.

                                FLIGHT DOCUMENTATION

Section 3A—Logging of Flight Activity

3.1. Enter and credit flight time. Enter and credit flight time on an individual’s flight record
when flown in an aircraft, simulator or controlling an RPA according to this instruction and
properly logged on AFTO Form 781 or AF Form 3250. The pilot designated, as “in command”
of the aircraft is responsible for making sure the appropriate form is dated and properly
completed, to include specific remarks as required.
   3.1.1. (Added-PACAF) While attending a formal school over 30 days where flying is
   authorized, individuals will document all flying hours and continuation training on the
   appropriate extract documents (AF Form 3520, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract,
   TAR/MAR). Within 3 duty days after returning to their duty station, individuals will provide
   this documentation to their unit flight manager who will in-turn update the ARMS database.
   Note: Aircrew who fly operational mission’s off-station will make an exact photo-copy of
   the original AFTO Form 781, certify as a true extract, and turn in the copy to their HARM or
   SARM office for updating in ARMS.
   3.1.2. (Added-PACAF) Do not release FRFs to any other individual without the approval
   of the Host Aviation Resource Management Chief. All records authorized to be signed in/out
   will have such action documented and tracked on an AF Form 614, Charge-Out Record. The
   individual signing for the record is responsible for returning it in the same condition as
   received. Do not release the FRF to individuals in suspended (ASC 04) aviation service
   status or individuals otherwise known to be under investigation.
3.2. Crediting Flight Time. Credit flying time as follows:
   3.2.1. To credit flight activity, personnel must:
       3.2.1.1. Be physically qualified. The member cannot be in DNIF status and must be
       medically cleared for flying duty, documented on an AF Form 1042.
       3.2.1.2. Be physiologically qualified (if applicable for the aircraft).
       3.2.1.3. Be on AOs to take part in frequent and regular flights as aircrew, to obtain
       aircrew qualification, or as operational support members (IAW AFI 11-402).
       3.2.1.4. Be under an approved aircrew qualification code (based on AF Form 8/8a
       qualification) and aircrew position identifier (Table A2.3) designated on the flight
       authorization for the aircraft. (EXCEPTION: aircrew members authorized to perform
       inflight duties in non-USAF aircraft, IAW paragraph 1.11, will comply with guidance
       applicable to the authority controlling the aircraft in regards to flight authorization
       requirements.)
       3.2.1.5. Be part of the crew complement (AFI 65-503) authorized to perform aircrew
       duties in the aircraft in order to obtain and maintain aircrew qualification, or be required
       for the mission.
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                              73


         3.2.1.5.1. Individuals required for the mission who are not part of the crew
         complement may log flying time only when specifically authorized to perform duties
         required for the mission (e.g. AEs, CROs, PJs, combat camera, etc), or when
         specifically authorized to perform mission-related observation or evaluation duties.
         Members will comply with all other applicable requirements to include medical
         clearance and physiological training (if applicable).
         3.2.1.5.1. (PACAF) Individuals required for a mission to perform mission-related
         observation duties or evaluation duties but are not part of the crew complement must
         be approved by the squadron commander of the flying unit prior to flight. Document
         approval on a mission requirements letter (Atch 11) and provide to HARM to be filed
         permanently in the FRF.
             3.2.1.5.1.1. Commanders will include an explanatory note in the remarks section
             of the FA for crewmembers that exceed the crew complement but are required for
             the mission.
         3.2.1.5.2. Non-aircrew members assigned to flying unit commander positions may
         log flying time in assigned aircraft. Individuals will fly on a non-interference basis
         (reference paragraph 2.10.4), will use crew position “OX” (Colonel and above) or
         “XX” (Lt Col and below) IAW Table A2.3, and will log other time on the AFTO
         Form 781 for entry into ARMS.
         3.2.1.5.3. Non-aircrew members assigned to RPA sensor operator positions will log
         flying time in assigned RPA aircraft. Individuals will fly on a non-interference basis,
         will use aircrew position (Second Character) “X” IAW Table A2.3, and will log
         AFTO Form 781 flying time category commensurate with qualification and duties
         performed for entry into ARMS.
  3.2.2. Flights in any other capacity are orientation flights IAW paragraph 1.9.4.7.1 and
  logging flight time on an AFTO Form 781 is not authorized. Commanders will ensure
  crewmembers and parachutists do not credit flights/jumps while on leave, permissive TDY,
  or nonflying/nonjumping TDY/Temporary Additional Duty (TAD), regardless of duration, or
  while flying on an aircraft during point-to-point travel (not authorized or required to perform
  aircrew duties). Aircrew members will not log flying time when the purpose for flying is to
  make a proficiency-sustaining jump or perform jumpmaster duties. EXCEPTION:
  Pararescue personnel in X-coded billets may log flying time if aircrew duties are performed
  during the flying portion of the mission. Document duties performed in the remarks section
  of the AFTO Form 781.
     3.2.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Locally developed training accomplishment documents will
     be submitted to PACAF/A3TC for approval prior to utilization. Additionally, a waiver is
     required if the unit plans on going to paperless TARS by utilizing PEX or other types of
     systems to track continuation training.
  3.2.3. For each individual, the total flight time logged will not exceed the total AFTO Form
  781 flight time of the aircraft.
     3.2.3.1. Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Time. RPA crews may be authorized to
     simultaneously control more than one aircraft during flight operations. The total time
     logged by each individual will reflect the total time spent controlling aircraft inflight and
 74                                                 AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


       is not dependent upon the number of aircraft actually controlled. Flight time logged will
       not exceed the time the individual was performing inflight aircraft control duties. Flight
       time may be credited for Group 4 and Group 5 aircraft, as defined in Joint Publication
       (JP) 3-30, Command and Control for Joint Air Operations.
3.3. Definition of Flight Time Categories. The references in this paragraph to aircraft also
apply to synthetic training devices categorized as operational flying trainers or weapon system
trainers. Log flight time only on the AFTO Form 781 and AF Form 3520, ARMS
Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract, and use only the approved Flight Authorization Duty
Codes listed in Attachment 2, Table A2.3
   3.3.1. Primary Flight Time. Time logged by a member occupying a designated duty
   station identified in AFI 65-503, and actively performing the duty associated with their
   aircrew specialty. Only qualified aircrew members and aircrew members obtaining
   qualification in the aircraft will log primary time when performing in-flight duties. Non-
   rated/non-CEA aircrew members and operational support personnel who do not have an
   established crew duty station will log primary time only when actually performing required
   in-flight duty. For example: operating equipment or caring for medical evacuation patients.
       3.3.1.1. EXCEPTIONS:
          3.3.1.1.1. Pilot commanders and key supervisors who fly IAW the provisions of
          paragraph 3.6.1 will log primary time only when actually controlling the aircraft.
          3.3.1.1.2. Pilots who maintain qualification in single-place aircraft when completing
          instrument training or the instrument flight check in similar dual-place aircraft.
          3.3.1.1.3. Graduates of a military test pilot school (Air Force Test Pilot School, Navy
          Test Pilot School, etc.) are considered qualified and may log primary flight time using
          FP, FN, or FW as the flight authorization duty code while actively flying qualitative
          or approved short-term aircraft tests or evaluations. This does not authorize Test Pilot
          School graduates to perform duties on other missions requiring qualified aircrew
          members at the controls of the aircraft (e.g. functional check flights).
          3.3.1.1.4. Pararescue/Combat Rescue Officer aircrew members assigned to
          authorized flying billets, on active flying AOs and qualified in the MDS, who are
          required in addition to the normal aircrew complement to perform in-flight duties for
          mass rescued aircrew member/personnel missions may log primary flight time when
          performing patient support duties on mass personnel recovery missions. Primary time
          is authorized only during the time required in-flight duties are performed. During
          periods when the PJ is not performing in-flight duties associated with the rescued
          members, or if the PJ is non-current for that MDS, “Other” flight time will be logged.
          Annotate specific inflight duties that require additional crewmembers (in additional to
          basic crew complement) on the mission in the remarks section of the AFTO Form
          781.
          3.3.1.1.5. Operational support medical personnel may log primary time when tasked
          to perform primary medical support duties on real world Combat Search and Rescue
          (CSAR), Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) or Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC)
          missions. If tasked to fly on non-US Air Force missions, ensure requests are
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                              75


        coordinated though the member’s MAJCOM IAW paragraph 1.11.1 of this
        instruction.
        3.3.1.1.6. Aeromedical Evacuation Crewmembers (AECM) on Aeromedical
        Readiness Missions (ARM) are authorized to conduct simultaneous (tandem) training
        on the same aircraft utilizing no more than two basic AE crews to meet flight
        currency requirements. AECMs in primary crew positions will log primary time when
        performing in-flight duties. Example: Two basic AE crews conducting separate in-
        flight training using separate in-flight kits, medical equipment, and mission
        documentation. A lead crew will be identified to the flight crew prior to take off for
        CRM purposes.
     3.3.1.2. For pilots, primary time is time actively controlling the aircraft, excluding
     hands-on-time flown while instructing and evaluating (log such time under instructor or
     evaluator). It is not predicated on which set of controls is being used (multi-place
     aircraft), or on the duty position indicated on the flight authorization. Pilots receiving
     instruction while controlling the aircraft will log primary time.
     3.3.1.3. Astronauts performing duties in the space shuttle may log primary time in their
     rated specialty in accordance with the preceding paragraphs. Astronauts performing space
     station duties may log primary time for the duration of space station activity. For space
     station duty, use Aircrew Position Identifier (Second Character) “A” from Attachment 2,
     Table A2.3
     3.3.1.4. For other aircrew specialties, log primary flight time only when performing
     duties at a duty position established for that specialty. Where more than one station is
     established for the same specialty, one member at each such station may log primary time
     while actually performing the duties associated with that station (for example, multiple
     Air Surveillance Operator positions on a single aircraft). (MAJCOMs will specify which
     AFI 65-503-authorized crew duty station(s) flight test engineers may occupy during test
     functions. During periods when the flight test engineer is not actively performing his or
     her evaluation/test duties, Other time will be logged.) Except under conditions in this
     paragraph, the total primary time for any specific aircrew specialty will not exceed the
     total flight time. Note: Due to the broad nature of flight surgeon duties, each position
     which another aircrew member occupies (as defined in AFPD 11-4, e.g., pilot, navigator,
     ABM, observer, CEA personnel), may be considered as a flight surgeon station/position
     (i.e., a KC-135 with a pilot, copilot, and boom operator would be authorized three flight
     surgeon stations). If there are more flight surgeons onboard than aircrew stations, the
     total primary time must be split between those flight surgeons onboard by logging
     primary and other time. When the number of flight surgeons on board is less or equal to
     the number of occupied aircrew stations, all flight surgeons are authorized to log primary
     time for the entire mission.
     3.3.1.5. Nonrated aircrew members on active flying AOs, qualified in specific aircraft,
     but tasked to perform in-flight aircrew duties for a time-sensitive mission in an aircraft in
     which they are not current and/or not qualified, will log aircrew certification code (first
     character of crew position) “F” and primary time for that mission. See also paragraph
     3.2.1.5.2 Note: Utilization of non-current and/or unqualified personnel is an exception to
76                                                 AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


     established policy. Every effort must be made to obtain current and qualified personnel to
     perform aircrew duties prior to utilizing non-current and/or unqualified personnel.
  3.3.2. Secondary Flight Time. Flight time logged by a crewmember who is performing
  inflight duties related to the crewmember’s specialty, but who is not controlling the function
  of that specialty. Except as listed below, the total secondary time logged in each specialty
  will not exceed the total flight time. When crewmembers are in excess of the authorized crew
  complement, annotate in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781 the secondary duties performed
  by additional aircrew.
     3.3.2.1. The member must be maintaining or obtaining qualification in the aircraft to log
     secondary time. EXCEPTION: Crewmembers in aircrew positions designated in AFI 65-
     503; and tasked to perform primary duties on aircraft other than their assigned aircraft
     (e.g., Flight Attendants tasked by TACC or HHQ to support Silver Bullet or DV
     missions) will log secondary time as long as they maintain currency in their primary
     aircraft. The member’s aircrew certification code will reflect the current qualification. If
     not qualified in the aircraft, the member will log “X” or “O” as the aircrew qualification
     code first character IAW Table A2.3
     3.3.2.2. For pilots, log secondary time while occupying a duty position having a set of
     flight controls and not actively controlling the aircraft, instructing, or evaluating.
     3.3.2.3. For other aircrew specialties, log secondary time when actually performing
     inflight duties of the specialty, but not at the primary duty station established for that
     specialty (for example, second navigator during airdrop missions or additional PJs/CROs
     on AOs required to perform “in-flight duties” assisting mass aircrew/personnel on a
     rescue mission) when dictated by mission requirements.
         3.3.2.3.1. Annotate in the remarks section of the AFTO Form 781 specific inflight
         duties performed and circumstances that require additional crewmembers (in
         additional to basic crew complement) to perform the mission.
     3.3.2.4. A current Aeromedical Evacuation Crewmember (AECM) may log secondary
     time when performing simulated patient duties or Mission Clinical Coordinator duties
     during aeromedical readiness missions. A noncurrent AECM may only log Other flight
     time when performing simulated patient duties.
     3.3.2.5. Except as provided for in AFI 65-503, the total secondary time logged in each
     specialty will not exceed the total flight time.
     3.3.2.6. Pararescue aircrew members assigned to authorized flying billets, on active
     flying AOs and qualified in the MDS, who are required in addition to the normal aircrew
     complement to perform in-flight duties for mass rescued aircrew member/personnel
     missions, may log secondary time when performing simulated patient duties or Mission
     Coordinator duties on mass personnel recovery training missions. Secondary time is
     authorized only during such time those in-flight duties are performed. During periods
     when the PJ is not performing “in-flight” duties associated with the rescued members or
     mission coordinator, or non-current for that MDS, only Other flight time will be logged.
  3.3.3. Instructor Flight Time. Flight time logged by a designated and qualified instructor
  while actively performing authorized instructional duties. Includes “hands on” time during
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                               77


  demonstration activities that are part of instructional duties. The instructor is not required to
  occupying a primary duty station established for that specialty, but must be actually
  performing instructor duties. Except as provided for in this section, members must be
  qualified and current in the aircraft to log instructor time. Except as provided for in AFI 65-
  503 and paragraph 3.3.3.1, the total instructor flight time for each aircrew specialty will not
  exceed the total flight time.
     3.3.3.1. Instructors may log instructor time while accomplishing unlike specialty training
     instruction (e.g., an instructor navigator training pilots/boom operators for a three-person
     crew or third pilots in the navigator seat). Only the amount of time used to train a specific
     event may be logged as instructor time. If more than one instructor of like specialty are
     on the aircraft to provide simultaneous instruction for crewmembers of different
     specialties, both instructors may log instructor time (e.g., two instructor navigators are on
     the same aircraft, one is instructing a student navigator and the other is instructing a
     boom operator). In this case, total instructor time logged may exceed total flight time
     logged. Enter a remark on the back of the AFTO Form 781 explaining the rationale for
     logging excess instructor time.
     3.3.3.2. Two instructors (to include FTU) of the same specialty may fly together and
     each log instructor time; however, total instructor time logged may not exceed total flight
     time logged. (e.g., A new FTU instructor is flying with a student crew and a more
     experienced FTU instructor flies with the new FTU instructor; instruction can occur
     between the new FTU instructor and student or between the experienced FTU instructor
     and new instructor, but not both simultaneously. Therefore, the total instructor time
     logged may not exceed total flight time.).
     3.3.3.3. Aircrew members who are instructor qualified in one aircraft, and who are
     current and qualified (but not qualified as an instructor) in another aircraft, may log
     instructor time while flying in the second aircraft and providing instruction to an aircrew
     member in the first aircraft. This applies to instructors in single seat aircraft who are also
     qualified in chase aircraft, but who do not maintain instructor qualification in the chase
     aircraft. Instructor time may be logged only while actively providing instruction. Enter a
     remark on the back of the AFTO Form 781 to explain the rationale for logging instructor
     time in the chase aircraft (this paragraph may be cited as a reference).
     3.3.3.4. Instructors will log primary, secondary, or other time, depending on their
     activity, when not performing instructor duties.
     3.3.3.5. Log simulator console time as instructor time when the crewmember is qualified
     as an instructor in the aircraft. When MAJCOMs authorize crewmembers to be
     instructors in the simulator only, they may log simulator console time as instructor time.
     MAJCOMs will determine which types of simulators qualify for this approval, e.g.,
     operational flight trainers, weapon system trainers, etc.
  3.3.4. Evaluator Flight Time. Flight time flown by a designated and certified flight
  evaluator while actively performing authorized flight evaluation duties. Includes “hands on”
  time if coincident with performance of flight evaluator duties. The member is not required to
  occupy a primary duty station established for that specialty, but must be actually performing
  evaluator duties. Evaluators will also log instructor, primary, secondary, or other time,
  depending on their activity, when not performing evaluator duties. Note: Members must be
78                                                 AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


  current and certified in the aircraft to log evaluator time. When flight evaluators conduct
  flight evaluations onboard aircraft in which they are not qualified, then members must log
  “O” or “X” as the aircrew qualification code first character IAW Table A2.3
     3.3.4.1. Aircrew members who are designated and certified as a flight evaluator in one
     aircraft, and who are current and qualified (but not certified as a flight evaluator) in
     another aircraft, may log evaluator time while flying in the second aircraft and evaluating
     an aircrew member in the first aircraft. This applies to flight evaluators in single seat
     aircraft who are also qualified in chase aircraft, but who are not certified as a flight
     evaluator in the chase aircraft. Enter a remark on the back of the AFTO Form 781 to
     explain the rationale for logging evaluator time in the chase paragraph (this paragraph
     may be cited as a reference).
  3.3.5. Other Flight Time. Flight time flown by members who are on the flight
  authorization, but who are not occupying a designated duty station or conforming to the
  requirements of primary, secondary, instructor, or evaluator time. For example: additional or
  extra crewmembers taking part in the flight, required for the mission to augment the crew or
  perform mission-related observation or evaluator duties (not qualified in the aircraft).
  Indoctrination fliers log other time. Crewmembers will log other time during periods of crew
  rest or sleep.
  3.3.6. Combat and Combat Support Flight Time.
     3.3.6.1. Combat. Aerial activity, engagements, or attacks conducted by aircraft against
     an enemy of the US or an opposing foreign force when there is risk of exposure to hostile
     fire. Aerial activity in support of forces engaged in combat when there is risk of exposure
     to hostile fire. Combat includes both elements: activity against an enemy or opposing
     force (or activity supporting forces engaging an enemy or opposing force) and risk of
     exposure to hostile fire.
         3.3.6.1.1. As soon as possible after a combat zone is established, the Commander Air
         Force Forces (COMAFFOR) will identify which portion constitutes hostile airspace.
         Hostile airspace is airspace within a combat zone that has been specifically
         designated as hostile airspace by the COMAFFOR, based on risk of exposure to
         hostile fire. The combat zone may contain areas that are not designated as hostile
         airspace. For the purposes of logging combat time the aerial activity must be
         accomplished in a designated combat zone within the designated hostile airspace.
         Flight within the combat zone but outside of the designated area or areas of hostile
         airspace does not qualify as combat time, since there is no risk of exposure to hostile
         fire. (EXCEPTION: In cases of aircrews that employ standoff weapons, the
         COMAFFOR under extraordinary circumstances may permit those aircrews to log
         combat time outside of the hostile airspace and/or outside of the designated combat
         zone. If an exception is granted, include the exception in the guidance designating the
         combat zone and the hostile airspace.) COMAFFOR will publish guidelines
         specifying which aircraft missions may log combat/combat support flight time and
         will identify the inclusive dates that the hostile airspace is activated for logging
         combat time. During contingencies when a combat zone is not designated but the use
         of force is authorized, COMAFFOR will coordinate with AF/A3/5 to establish hostile
         airspace criteria and guidelines for logging combat/combat support flight time. Note:
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                              79


          COMAFFOR will issue new guidance and procedures every two years to ensure all
          Air Force units are aware of the current policy.
       3.3.6.2. Combat Support. Aerial activity, engagements, or attacks conducted by aircraft
       against an enemy of the US or an opposing foreign force that operate outside the
       designated hostile airspace, where there is no risk of exposure to hostile fire. Includes
       aerial activity directly supporting forces engaged in combat or directly supporting those
       who are actively supporting combat when the aerial activity occurs outside the designated
       hostile airspace. Hostile airspace is determined as described above under combat time.
       3.3.6.3. Combat or combat support time will be logged from takeoff to landing when an
       individual: (1) meets the requirements of combat/combat support flight time, (2) is on an
       AO that requires the member to fly, (3) is listed on the flight authorization authorized to
       perform in-flight aircrew duties and, (4) is required for the mission IAW paragraph
       3.2.1.5 of this instruction. Additionally, eligible members authorized to fly IAW
       paragraph 3.6.1 may log combat or combat support time. Do not combine mission
       symbols; use one symbol for the entire flight.
3.4. Flight Condition Time. The categories listed in paragraph 3.3 are the basis for
accumulating flying experience for all flying personnel. Record all flying time accrued on a
mission in the appropriate category. Provisions have been made to record, for historical
purposes, a breakout of flight time by flight condition: night, instrument, and simulated
instrument. Primary time flown in more than one condition simultaneously (for example, night
and instrument) would result in entries under both of these categories on the form. The type of
time logged will be consistent with the flight condition actually encountered or procedure
accomplished. MAJCOMs may further restrict logging combinations that are inconsistent with
command policy or procedures. Use the following guidance for logging flight condition time:
   3.4.1. Night Time. The portion of primary, secondary, instructor, or evaluator flight time
   logged between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight,
   as published in the American Air Almanac. (EXCEPTION: An evaluator will log night time
   as a flight condition in conjunction with “Other” flight time when performing evaluation
   duties onboard aircraft in which he or she does not maintain qualification.) For personnel
   assigned at latitudes above 60 degrees north (May through August) or below 60 degrees
   south (November through February), night requirements are waived when removal from
   active flying or PCS occurs during the summer months. May be logged in a flight simulator
   when operating in simulated night conditions.
   3.4.2. Night Vision Goggle Time. The portion of flight time logged by an aircrew member
   wearing night vision goggles between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of
   morning civil twilight, as published in the American Air Almanac. Crewmembers performing
   aircrew duties in a crew position with NVG training requirements will log this time while
   wearing NVGs. NVG time may also be logged by flight surgeons and aircrew members
   instructing or evaluating individuals who are performing crew duties where NVGs are
   required and worn. NVG time will not exceed total night time logged. NVG time may be
   logged in a flight simulator if the simulator is accredited for NVG training (simulator model
   and simulator software).
   3.4.3. Primary Instrument Time. The portion of primary, instructor, or evaluator flight
   time logged when external conditions require that the aircraft attitude be maintained
 80                                                  AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


   primarily by reference to the flight instruments. Pilots only will log this time when
   performing duties in this flight condition. Note: To log primary instrument time in the
   aircraft, an instructor or evaluator pilot must occupy a duty station with a set of flight
   controls, but does not have to actively (hands-on) control the aircraft. An accredited flight
   simulator or flight training device may be used by a pilot to log instrument time, provided an
   authorized instructor is present during the simulated flight. Simulators are accredited for
   logging instrument time according to AFI 36-2251, Management of Air Force Training
   Systems.
   3.4.4. Primary Simulated Instrument Time. The portion of primary, “hands-on”
   instructor, or “hands-on” evaluator time logged by an individual controlling the aircraft
   attitude primarily by reference to the flight instruments. Pilots only will log this time when
   performing duties in this flight condition. May be logged in a flight simulator.
3.5. Non-rated/non-CEA Flight Time. Non-rated/non-CEA aircrew members will log flying
time using the proper flight authorization duty code. Log time only when authorized on AOs and
when actively performing specific inflight duties as designated by flight authorization orders
(paragraph 3.8). Aeromedical evacuation crewmembers log time only when listed on the flight
authorization and actively engaged in operational air evacuation or air rescue missions;
aeromedical research and development inflight; or air evacuation training missions that require
AECMs in a crew position, being instructed, being evaluated, or as listed in paragraph 3.3.2.4
above.

Section 3B—Logging of Flight Activity (General)

3.6. Logging Flight Time for Pay. Credit only flight time logged according to paragraph 3.2
toward incentive pay requirements. Flight time flown in “O” or “X” status does not entitle the
member to OFDA credit, ACIP or HDIP. Note: See Attachment 2, Table A2.3 EXCEPTION:
Air Technicians (AT) and Air Reserve Technicians (ART) must be in military status to log time
for incentive pay. This Air Force Instruction and MAJCOMs define the inflight duties that
qualify individuals for ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP.
   3.6.1. Logging Flight Time by Rated Officers and CEAs Who are Qualified in One
   Aircraft and Not Other Types of Aircraft Assigned to Their Units. MAJCOMS and
   equivalent organizations, and subordinate organizations, may authorize commanders
   (including unit commanders) and key supervisors (API 6, 8, B, or D) who are qualified and
   maintain currency in one type aircraft, but have other types assigned to their units, to fly in a
   primary crew position in assigned aircraft in which they are not qualified. Individuals will be
   under the supervision of an instructor for the applicable crew position. The crewmember will
   log an “O” or “X” as the aircrew qualification code first character and his or her assigned
   second character crew position code IAW Table A2.3 (As noted above, flight time flown in
   “O” or “X” status does not entitle the member to OFDA credit, ACIP or HDIP.) See also
   paragraph 3.3.1.1.1 Members who fly IAW this paragraph will log all applicable flight time,
   to include combat or combat support time (see paragraph 3.3.6.3). Members will comply
   with minimum requirements in AFI 11-202 Vol 1 and in the MDS-Specific Vol 1 for aircraft
   in which they log flight time. (EXCEPTION: Form 8/8a qualification and flight event
   currency are not required in additional aircraft, unless members maintain multiple
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                              81


   qualification.) Note: Pilots who fly under the provisions of this paragraph may fly in the seat
   with MEP on board the aircraft. See also paragraph 1.12.4.2.
3.7. Logging Flight Time by Rated Officers and Career Enlisted Aviators in Inactive
Flying Status. Personnel in such status do not log flying time in their specialty in US
Government aircraft except as provided in FAC waivers listed in Table 2.2, paragraphs 2.7.2.2.,
2.8.1.1., and 2.14 In all such cases, inactive crewmembers must maintain physical and
physiological qualification (if applicable) for aviation service.
   3.7.1. (Added-PACAF) Rated/key supervisors unqualified in the aircraft will log “other”
   time. Paragraph 2.13.1 of this supplement also applies.
3.8. Non-rated/non-CEA Crewmembers and Operational Support Flight Time. Inflight
duties authorized by Air Force and MAJCOM instructions determine the proper flying duty or
position symbol for logging flight time on AFTO Form 781. This flying time is accomplished
when actively performing inflight duties as follows:
   3.8.1. Non-rated/non-CEA Crewmember Duty. When on AOs and properly assigned to
   an authorized non-rated/non-CEA aircrew position as part of the regularly constituted crew
   IAW AFIs 11-401, 11-402, and 65-503, and:
       3.8.1.1. The individual’s primary duty requires the performance of inflight duties on a
       frequent and regular basis.
       3.8.1.2. The approved inflight duties are essential to operating aircraft systems and
       associated equipment required for mission accomplishment.
   3.8.2. Operational Support (Non-crewmember) Duty. Members are placed on AOs for a
   specified time and must be properly authorized to perform inflight duties not prescribed in
   AFI 65-503 and to supplement a regularly constituted aircrew. They are on flight status for
   limited periods to perform essential and specific in-flight duties that cannot be accomplished
   by authorized aircrew personnel. Refer to AFI 11-402 for guidance.
3.9. Logging Flight Time in Non-US Air Force Aircraft. Only members performing inflight
duties authorized by paragraph 1.11 may log flying time in non-US Air Force aircraft for credit
towards OFDA requirements or incentive pay. Otherwise only “Other” flight time will be
credited in an individual’s flight records.
3.10. Logging Other US Military Time. Total career flight time obtained in the service of
other US military agencies when not officially directed by the Air Force, and when verified by
logbook or other official records certified by authorized persons. This time will be entered into
ARMS in the Other US Military hour block. Time obtained in other US military aircraft is not
included in this category if performed in an official capacity (e.g., directed by competent Air
Force order); such time is recorded as Air Force rated time. Note: Inter-service transfers who
previously participated in an Air Force aviation exchange program may have their time separated
by Air Force MDS. This time will be subtracted from the total Other US Military flying time.
3.11. Logging Student Time. Total career flight time acquired by rated trainees in USAF or
USAF-directed undergraduate flight training prior to attaining a rating. This time will be entered
into ARMS in the student time hour block. Note: Interservice transfers who previously
participated in an Air Force aviation exchange program may have their time separated by Air
Force MDS. Example: Capt Schaffer, an interservice transfer, flew 350 hours in the F-16 during
 82                                                  AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


his Naval career under an approved Air Force exchange program. Capt Schaffer’s flight time
may be logged under the MDS F-16 in ARMS. This time will be subtracted from the total Other
US Military flying time.
3.11. (PACAF)For Inter-Service transfer members, HARM must obtain an official
military document to update “Other US Military Time” in the career total field in
ARMS. Do not enter time in as individual aircraft. Exception: inter-service transfers who
previously participated in an Air Force aviation exchange program may have their time separated
by Air Force MDS. Table A2.1. AFTO Form 781 Entries According to TO 00-20-1.
3.12. Logging Foreign Military Time. Total career flight time obtained in the service of other
governments when not officially directed by the Air Force, and when verified by logbook or
other official record certified by authorized persons. This time will be entered into ARMS in the
Foreign Military hour block.
3.13. Logging Flight Time in Other Than Military Aircraft. Flight time logged according to
paragraph 3.2 in other than military aircraft is credited toward annual flying requirements only
when directed by competent Air Force AOs and such flying is inherent in the primary duty
assignment of the person concerned. Aircrews must document flight time on an AFTO Form 781
or AF Form 3250 and, except for CAP-USAF or Introductory Flying Training missions, be in
aircraft with 450 or more rated horsepower.
3.14. Logging Civilian Flight Time. Total career flight time acquired in civilian aircraft of 450
or more rated horsepower, when verified by logbook or other official record certified by
authorized persons. (These authorized persons are operations officers of military aviation
activities; suitable agents of commercial aviation companies; operating managers of fields from
which the reported flying was performed, if in privately owned aircraft; and officials of
recognized civil flight schools.) This time will be entered into ARMS in the civilian hour block.
3.15. Quarterly General Officer Flying Hour Information Report. MAJCOMs will submit
Quarterly GO Flying Hour Information Report (RCS: HAF-A3O[Q]0702) via message to HQ
USAF/A3O-AT by the 15th of the month following each calendar quarter. This report is
designated emergency status code C-3. Submit data requirements as prescribed, but they may be
delayed to allow the submission of higher precedence reports. Continue reporting during
emergency conditions, delayed precedence. Discontinue reporting during MINIMIZE. Provide
data for operational fliers. As directed by AF/A3O-AT, provide data for indoctrination fliers. The
report will include the following:
   3.15.1. Rank/Name/Position. Include general officer selectees.
   3.15.2. Aircraft qualification/aircrew status.
   3.15.3. Flight Authorization Duty Codes.
   3.15.4. Aircrew Position Indicator Code/Aviation Service Code.
   3.15.5. Total flight hours/sorties in all aircraft in which the member is authorized to obtain
   or maintain qualification (AF Form 8) by aircraft and by flight time category. Unless
   directed by AF/A3O-AT, do not provide data for aircraft in which the member is not
   authorized to obtain or maintain qualification.

Terms
Aircrew—As defined in AFPD 11-4, Aviation Service, the total complement of rated (pilots,
navigators, combat systems operators, air battle managers, and flight surgeons), career enlisted
aviators (1AXXX and IUXXX Air Force Specialty Codes), and nonrated aircrew (K-, Q-, or X-
prefixed Air Force Specialty Code) personnel responsible for the safe ground and flight
operation of the aircraft and onboard systems, or for airborne duties essential to accomplishment
of the aircraft‘s mission. Includes members in initial formal training for immediate assignment to
an authorized operational flying position. Individuals must be on AOs and assigned to an
authorized position according to AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, or
nonrated aircrew not in an aircraft’s basic crew complement, but required for the mission.
Aircrew members perform their principal duties inflight and their presence is required for the
aircraft to accomplish its primary tasked mission. Duties must be essential to operating the
aircraft or mission systems and equipment used for completing a mission, or other duties
essential to the aircraft’s mission. Note: As used in the publication, the term “navigator”
includes all navigator specialties and is synonymous with the designation Combat Systems
Officer (CSO). New UFT graduates are designated CSOs, but previously qualified individuals
will continue to be identified as navigators.
Air Force Aircraft—US Government aircraft under US Air Force jurisdiction.
Airmanship Programs (USAFA)—Any USAF Academy course listed in the catalog and
administered by the 306 FTG at the Academy airfield or deployed location.
Authentication—The process that makes an administrative order official. Evidenced by proper
signature or seal that a document is genuine and official. The only seal authorized on AOs is on
Department of the Air Force (DAF) orders (For example: A DAF order that awards a pilot
rating).
Authorized Aircrews—Aircrews authorized according to AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and
Planning Factors, Attachment A36-1 (Authorized Aircrew Composition Active Forces),
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                                  89


Attachment A37-1 (Authorized Aircrew Composition Reserve Forces), and Attachment A38-1,
(Authorized Aircrew Composition Guard Forces).
Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP)—Incentive pay for rated officers in an aviation career
as authorized in the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the Aviation Career Improvement
Act of 1989, and the FY 96 National Defense Authorization Act.
Aviation Service Date (ASD)—Effective date of the first AO to perform flight duties. For rated
officers, this date is set when the member first reports to the aviation activity that has aircraft in
which he or she will receive flight training leading to an aeronautical rating and is placed on AOs
(for example, class start date of SUPT, SUNT, UPT-H class, or Weapons Systems Training) or
date of commission, whichever is later. For flight surgeons, the ASD equals the date all
requirements for the flight surgeon rating were met, which is normally the date Course
50BY9351 or equivalent was completed. (EXCEPTION: The ASD for medical students who
have completed Course 50BY9351 will be the date post graduate medical training is completed,
an unrestricted medical license is attained, AFSC 48XX is awarded, and the flight surgeon rating
is assigned. All requirements must be accomplished for award of the ASD.) For Air Battle
Managers, the ASD is the date the crewmember enters formal ABM flying training (class start
date). For career enlisted aviators, the ASD is set when the member first reports to the aviation
activity that has aircraft in which he or she will receive flight training leading to career enlisted
aviator status and is placed on AOs. Rated ASDs and CEA ASDs are established separately. See
also AFI 11-402.
Aviation Programs (USAFA)—Any USAF Academy course listed in the catalog and
administered by the Dean of Faculty in conjunction with the 306 FTG at the Academy airfield or
deployed location.
Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA)—Personnel in AFSCs 1AXXX and 1UXXX.
Career Enlisted Flier Incentive Pay (CEFIP)—Incentive pay for career enlisted aviators in an
aviation career as authorized in the FY 00 NDAA.
Civil Air Patrol-United States Air Force (CAP-USAF)—CAP-USAF is the Air Force agency
that coordinates or approves use of the Civil Air Patrol to carry out non-combat missions of the
Air Force (IAW AFI 10-2701).
Commander—When used in this instruction, “commander” refers to a wing commander (or
comparable level), or any level higher within the chain of command, of a flying unit to which an
individual is assigned or attached for flying. If an individual is geographically separated from the
wing, authority may be delegated to a group or squadron level.
Conditional Entitlement—The condition under which rated officers and career enlisted aviators
in an aviation career are entitled to receive ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP, conditional to meeting
minimum monthly flying time standards IAW DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A; and AFI 11-421.
Continuation Training—The continuation training program provides crew members with the
volume, frequency, and mix of training (flying and ground training) necessary to maintain
proficiency in the assigned qualification level. This training must be recorded in the ARMS
database.
Continuous Entitlement—The condition under which rated officers and career enlisted aviators
in an aviation career are entitled to receive ACIP or CEFIP without regard to flight activity.
 90                                                   AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


Flight—For the purpose of this instruction only, a flight is synonymous with a mission.
Flight Authorization (FA)—A single document used to identify all aircrew, operational
support, and authorized non-interference members on AOs, who are qualified and required to
perform duties on specific aircraft for a scheduled mission. MEP may be placed on the flight
authorization, only in the Remarks section. AE/PJ FAs are attached to the aircraft FA for the
mission(s) on which they performed duties.
Form—Term used to identify Air Force forms and IMTs (Information Management Tools).
IAW AFI 33-360, the IMT designator is being phased out; it is not used in this publication.
Frequent and Regular—“Frequent and regular” is a DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Chapter 22,
term which establishes the minimum monthly flight requirements to be entitled to conditional
Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP), Career Enlisted Flight Incentive Pay (CEFIP), or
Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP). DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, sets the minimum at four
hours for active duty (Chapter 22) and two hours for Air Reserve Components (ARC) per
calendar month (Chapter 58), or a prorated share for lesser periods. By itself, the requirement to
fly frequently and regularly is not justification to assign an individual to aircrew or operational
support flier status. There must be a need to perform inflight duties.
Government Aircraft—An aircraft owned, operated, or leased by the US Government.
Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP)—Incentive pay authorized for personnel required to
perform flight duties on a frequent and regular basis.
Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) Office—The office responsible for ARMS,
flight record, and jump record management. The HARM office determines entitlement to ACIP,
CEFIP, and HDIP.
Host Aviation Resource Manager—The sole approval authority (except for AF/A3O-AT) at
each flying base for determining entitlement and the starting and stopping of ACIP, CEFIP, and
HDIP for flying and parachute duties; responsible for interpreting public law as it pertains to
entitlement to these incentive pays along with auditing and reconciliation of these incentive pays;
and the single point of contact for ARMS. This position is inherently governmental.
Instrument Flight—Flight conducted when external conditions require that the aircraft attitude
be maintained primarily by reference to the flight instruments.
Intent—For the purpose of publishing an AO, the intent of an AO is to validate individual
qualification for aviation and/or parachutist service, authorize and direct frequent and regular
participation in aerial flight or parachute duties; and establish or terminate individual entitlement
to ACIP, CEFIP, and HDIP. Intent also includes the effective date of the AO.
Interfly—The exchange and/or substitution of aircrews and aircraft between MAJCOMs.
Mission—For the purpose of this instruction only, mission is defined as a primary objective for
which an aircraft is operated (see Mission Symbols) and which may consist of an increment of
one or more sorties. Several missions may be accomplished in one sortie.
Mission Essential Personnel (MEP)—personnel who are required for the execution of the
aircraft or unit mission, to include follow-on missions. Includes additional aircrew members
required for follow-on missions (may be further defined in MAJCOM supplements to this
instruction) and personnel not authorized AOs who are tasked to perform ground support duties
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                                 91


at enroute locations or destination points that are directly related and essential to accomplishment
of the aircraft or unit mission, e.g. a specialist or technician required to provide aircraft support
or a security team required to guard the aircraft. MEP may include military staff personnel; U.S.
Government employees; government contract employees (IAW the terms and conditions of a
current government contract); and foreign military, civilian, and contract employees (IAW the
terms and conditions of a current government contract); when those individuals are required for
the mission. Flights involving foreign nationals must be reviewed for foreign disclosure
requirements and political concerns, to include compliance with AFI 16-201, and must include
SAF/IA regional division coordination. MAJCOMs may further define MEP in supplements to
this instruction but guidance may not be less restrictive than the guidance contained herein. The
OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the aircraft grants MEP status.
(EXCEPTIONS: For AMC missions already in the system, the TACC Senior Controller may
approve MEP status. MAJCOM Standardization/Evaluation Chiefs may approve MEP status for
MAJCOM or MAJCOM-gained missions for evaluators assigned to the MAJCOM.) If
operational control transfers, the OG/CC (or equivalent) who assumes follow-on operational
control may continue/revise MEP status (coordinate changes with originating authority).
MAJCOMs may establish intra-command and inter-command guidance to facilitate this process.
MEP, to include additional crewmembers who fly in MEP status, are passengers and may only
fly in aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R.
(EXCEPTION: MEP who are mission essential may fly on aircraft not normally equipped for
carrying passengers. MEP who fly under the provisions of this exception must be physically and
physiologically [when required] qualified and must complete applicable egress training prior to
flight.)
Officer Service Date (OSD)—Effective date of service as a commissioned, warrant, or flight
officer, whether or not served on extended active duty. This is usually equivalent to total federal
commissioned service date backdated by any period served as a warrant or flight officer. For
flight surgeons, the OSD includes constructive service granted medical officers in the
computation of creditable service for basic pay.
Operational Flying—Flying performed under competent orders by rated and CEA personnel
(primarily for mission, support, or training purposes) while serving in an assignment where basic
flying skills usually are maintained for performing assigned duties.
Operational Support Flier—An individual whose primary, full-time duty does not require
flying. The Air Force may require these individuals to fly on an occasional basis to perform a
specific, essential inflight duty that cannot be performed by an assigned aircrew member. Duties
may include, but are not limited to inflight test, operation, or inflight maintenance of specific
aircraft systems or installed equipment. To receive non-crew hazardous duty pay, operational
support fliers must be placed on AOs and complete prescribed flying hour requirements.
Authorized man-months are required prior to issuance of AOs.
Orientation Flight—Continuous flights in DoD-owned aircraft performed within the local
flying area and terminating at the point of origin, conducted to reward and motivate individuals
(incentive orientation flights only), ensure a better understanding of a particular weapon system
and its role, or when the flight is determined to be in the best interest of the USAF.

Pilot In Command—The aircrew member designated by competent authority as being in
command of an aircraft and responsible for its safe operation and accomplishment of the
assigned mission.
Point-To-Point—Point-to-point means flights that takeoff from one location and land at a
different location. Point-to-point orientation flights are not authorized. EXCEPTION: Units
may accomplish orientation flights within the local flying area to operational and remote sites
that are part of the home unit, as long as the mission terminates at the point of origin. Such
flights providing unit mission orientation are not considered point-to-point flights and an
exception to policy is not required (OSD-ATL policy guidance, Feb 10).
Sortie—An AFTO Form 781 aircraft sortie begins when the aircraft begins to move forward on
takeoff or takes off vertically from rest at any point of support. It ends after airborne flight when
the aircraft returns to the surface and either of the following conditions occur: a) the engines are
stopped, or the aircraft is on the surface for five minutes, whichever occurs first; or, b) a change
is made in the crew which enplanes or deplanes a crewmember. For logging aircrew proficiency
training, on missions during which some crewmembers deplane and the remaining crew from the
original takeoff re-launch, this may be considered to be a continuation of the original aircrew
sortie. MAJCOMs may establish MDS-specific crew requirements and procedures for aircrew
continuation sorties.
Supervisory Aircrew or Staff Member—Personnel in supervisory or staff positions (API 6, 8,
B, and D) who actively fly; or in positions (API 3, 4, C, and E) that require aircrew expertise but
individuals are not required to fly.
Training Level—Assigned to individuals based on the continuation training aircrew status
(basic aircraft qualification, basic mission capable, or mission ready/combat mission ready) they
are required to maintain.
Training Period—Any training period determined by the MAJCOM or Wing in which training
requirements are performed.
Unit Commander—When used in this instruction, “unit commander” refers to the squadron
commander (or comparable level) or higher level within the chain of command.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AFTO FORM 781, ARMS AIRCREW/MISSION FLIGHT
                         DATA DOCUMENT

A2.1. Purpose. The AFTO Form 781-series provides maintenance, inspection, service
configuration, and flight operations records for weapon or support systems. AFTO Form 781,
ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, is the source document for recording and
reporting operational flight or training device information for each individual authorized to take
part in a mission. This form is the primary record of both personnel and aerospace vehicle flying
hours. It is the official record to validate flight pay eligibility for rated, CEA, and other non-
rated/non-CEA officer and enlisted members required to fly. The original AFTO Form 781 must
be maintained in the HARM office that services the unit to which the aircraft is assigned. This
form is available for downloading on the e-publishing website at www.e-publishing.af.mil.
A2.2. Scope. These instructions apply to all members authorized to log flight or training device
time in an airborne duty or position for the purpose of maintaining an official Air Force Flight
Record.
A2.3. Responsibilities. The AFTO Form 781 is established by TO 00-20-1. In most cases,
maintenance personnel are responsible for distributing and collecting these forms. Completing
the AFTO Form 781 and other forms in the series is a joint responsibility of maintenance
personnel and the pilot in command.
   A2.3.1. The crew chief or alternate ensures a sufficient number of copies of AFTO Form
   781 are onboard the aircraft and completes items 2 through 5 on a sufficient number of
   copies to fulfill mission requirements. If the forms are generated in advance, the pilot in
   command will confirm with maintenance personnel the correct data for items 2 and 3. (N/A
   for RPA units.)
   A2.3.2. The pilot in command ensures the AFTO Form 781 is dated and properly completed
   to show all pertinent flight data and the flight time for all personnel authorized to take part in
   the flight. The pilot in command will initial block 40 IAW Table A2.1
   A2.3.3. The completed AFTO Form 781 must be processed in the maintenance information
   system and delivered to the SARM for ARMS updating, then provided to the HARM office.
   (N/A for RPA units.)
       A2.3.3.1. The local HARM office will provide the maintenance organization that
       services the aircraft assigned the necessary organization and location information to be
       entered in items 4 and 5 of AFTO Form 781. This ensures completed forms are sent to
       the proper SARM or HARM office for entry into ARMS. (N/A for RPA units.)
       A2.3.3.2. Ensures an aviation resource manager or designated operations representative
       audits the unit’s AFTO Forms 781 for accuracy and eligibility and initials in item 41 of
       the form before sending it to the HARM office. Where local procedures establish the
       HARM office as the auditing agency, the responsible individual from that office initials
       the form in item 41.
       A2.3.3.3. The original AFTO Form 781 must be provided to the HARM office that
       services the unit to which the aircraft is assigned no later than 5 days after the end of the
 98                                                       AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


           month in which the flights were performed. For example, the Form 781 for a flight flown
           in March must be turned in to the servicing HARM office NLT 5 April. EXCEPTION:
           ARC units that track/maintain ACIP and CEFIP entitlement information may forward the
           AFTO Forms 781 to the servicing HARM office not later than the first day following two
           months after the month in which the flight was performed. In the preceding example, the
           forms would not be required to be turned into the HARM office until 1 June.
              A2.3.3.3.1. SARM offices will not maintain duplicate copies of AFTO Forms 781
              (including extracts). If changes are required after the flight information has been
              entered in ARMS and the form is at the HARM office, the pilot in command must
              contact the HARM office to make corrections.
           A2.3.3.4. RPA units will maintain the original AFTO Form 781 in the HARM office of
           the unit designated to perform to the mission.

               This will be the HARM office that processes and files the original forms.
      5        The name of the installation whose HARM office services the unit charged for flying
               hours identified in item 4 and processes and files the original AFTO Form 781.
AFTO FORM 781 ENTRIES (CERTIFIED BY THE PILOT IN COMMAND)
      1        Date. Use the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) date in the following ARMS
               compatible format: (Example) 22 Sep 2010.
      6        The flight sequence of each particular leg of the flight.
      7        Mission number assigned for this leg of the mission (MAJCOM option).
      8        Authorized mission symbol for each flight. Aircrew may enter all flights on the
               same GMT date on a single AFTO Form 781.
      9        International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code for the base or airport where
               the aircraft takes off. If a flight is continued from a previous entry, enter “INFL.”
               Use “XXXX” for classified locations or locations without an official ICAO identifier
               (i.e. a CV-22 landing in a field).
      10       Base ICAO code for the base or airport where the aircraft lands. If a flight is
               terminated without landing for a change in mission symbol, enter “INFL.” Use
               “XXXX” for classified locations or locations without an official ICAO identifier.
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                           99


   11     24-hour GMT clock time. The takeoff time is when the aircraft begins to move
          forward on takeoff roll.
   12     24-hour GMT clock time. The landing is when the aircraft is on the ground after
          being airborne and any of the following conditions occur: (a) The engines are
          stopped and shutdown occurs at or before five minutes after touchdown. (b) The
          aircraft has been on the ground for five minutes after touchdown; however, a series
          of practice landings is considered one flight. (c) A change is made in the crew where
          a crewmember enplanes or deplanes. Note: When a flight starts before 2400 GMT
          and ends after GMT midnight (2400Z), record and report the flight on the date of
          takeoff. A separate AFTO Form 781 is not necessary.
   13     Subtract takeoff time from landing time. Use the conversion table to the right to
          convert to hours and tenths, and enter the result.
   14     Number of touch-and-go, full stop, and total landings.
   15     Number of sorties accomplished. A sortie covers a flight from first take off to
          landing as described in block 12; however, if any flight entry is split (INFL), the
          sortie will be recorded on the flight that lists final landing.
   16     Special use as specified by MAJCOM.
   17     Flight authorization number generated in the SARM as specified in AFI 11-421.
          (MAJCOM option.)
   18     Unit issuing the flight authorization and designated to perform this mission will be
          annotated using the four-digit unit number. Use leading zeros when the unit number
          has fewer than four digits (0179AW).
TOTALS Sum of flight sequences “a” through “f” for total flight time, landings, and sorties at
       the end of the mission.
   19     Four-digit unit number to which the crewmember is assigned/attached for flying
          purposes. Use leading zeros when the unit number has fewer than four digits.
   20     Last four digits of the SSN of the crewmember. An error in this entry will result in
          time being lost or credited to another crewmember.
   21     Crewmember’s last name (printed). May use additional characters if another
          member in the unit has the same last name.
   22     Flight Authorization (FA) Duty Code assigned on the FA to the crewmember for this
          mission. This code cannot be higher than the individual’s current qualification, but
          will indicate duties that the individual crewmember is scheduled to perform on the
          mission. For example, if the individual is an IP, but is scheduled to perform MP
          duties on a mission, the individual will be listed as an MP on the Flight
          Authorization. Refer to Table A2.3 for a complete list of duty codes. Note: The
          only time the FA code will not match the scheduled duties on the FA is for
          extenuating circumstances. The AC must document the reason in the remarks of the
          AFTO Form 781. For example, a pilot was scheduled to perform IP duties in
 100                                               AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


           conjunction with upgrade training for a second pilot; however, the upgrading
           individual was DNIF and did not fly, so the pilot only performed primary duties. MP
           is logged with primary time and the AC documents the reason in the remarks section.
           When using the FA more than one day, log FA Duty Code actually performed and
           annotate in remarks if different from the FA.
  23-28    Times in hours and tenths for each category as defined in Chapter 3 of this
           instruction. The total time in item 28 cannot exceed the grand total in item 13 and
           total of items 23 through 27 cannot exceed item 28.
    29     Total number of sorties for this crewmember. Entry is normally the grand total (see
           item 15, above).
30, 33, 34, Hours and tenths of time performed in night, instrument, simulated or NVG
    36      conditions, as defined in Chapter 3 of this instruction.
  35, 37   Number of Combat and Combat Support Sorties flown that meet requirements as
           defined in Chapter 3 of this instruction.
    38     Air Reserve Component Flight Duty Status Code for the crewmember, if applicable.
           If used: 1=Active Duty, 2=Unit Training Assembly (Inactive Duty), 3=Flying
           Training Period (Inactive Period), 33=Dual Additional Flying Training Period
           (Inactive Duty), 4=Civilian (ART). Include separate lines to record the flying time
           accomplished in each Flying Duty Status Code.
    39     Initials of maintenance personnel at the debriefing who reviewed the form. (N/A for
           RPA units geographically separated)
    40     Initials of the pilot in command who certifies the form for accuracy. For multiple
           sorties, if the pilot in command changes, the individual acting as the pilot in
           command must initial for their particular sortie in the sortie block. If the pilot in
           command changes during any single sortie, the last individual to act as the pilot in
           command for that sortie will initial in the sortie block.
    41     Initials of the unit operations officer or Aviation Resource Manager (ARM) who
           verifies the accuracy and legibility of the form prior to entry into ARMS.
    42     Date (e.g., 22 Sep 2010) and initials of the ARM who input and audited the form.
    43     Date (e.g., 22 Sep 2010) and initials of the ARM who audited and processed the
           form.

           - Logging instructor/evaluator time in the chase aircraft IAW paragraphs 3.3.3.3 and
           3.3.4.1. (Basic AFI)

A2.4. Extract AFTO Form 781. Each individual on the form whose flight records are
maintained by another HARM office prepares a data extract photocopy of the original AFTO
Form 781 to be sent, usually within five duty-days, to that member’s HARM office. Extracted
individual(s) will place their squadron’s contact information (unit designation and SARM or
HARM DSN/FAX number) in the remarks section of the AFTO Form 781. If more than one
individual named on the form is serviced by the HARM office, a single data extract copy may be
used. For example Captain Grengs, a pilot from Minot AFB, flew a mission at Grand Forks AFB.
A photocopy of the AFTO Form 781 is made, certified in item 43, and sent to the HARM office
at Minot. Extracts at the same base for aircrew members serviced by the same HARM office are
not authorized.
     A2.4.1. Individuals whose flight records have been closed out to transfer custody must
     prepare a data extract form for each authorized flight during that period.
     A2.4.2. The data extract AFTO Form 781 is an exact copy of the original AFTO Form 781.
     A2.4.3. Upon receipt of an extract, member’s servicing SARM/HARM personnel will lightly
     line through individual mission data lines of members not in the local ARMS database,
     leaving only the members they will enter in ARMS. The SARM office responsible for
     management of the original AFTO Form 781 will have a line lightly drawn through members
     who were extracted (not from aircraft’s home station).

     A2.4.4. The data extract form is identified and certified in item 43, either by a commissioned
     officer (preferably the pilot in command), a government civilian (when pilot in command), or
     by the HARM Chief/Superintendent.
     A2.4.5. See Attachment 3 for an extract authorized for non-operational, long TDYs.

       back to their respective MAJCOM Flying Hour Program Manager.
       A2.4.7.2. (Added-PACAF) Wing Current Operations will ensure squadron SARMs on
       a daily basis reconcile their daily aircraft utilization reports (AURs), utilizing the AFTO
       Forms 781 as a source document, with maintenance debrief, which inputs the top half of
       the AFTO Form 781 into the Maintenance Information System (MIS) database. If there
       are any discrepancies between operations (SARM) and maintenance debrief, the
       discrepancies should be reconciled the next duty day or as soon as possible. This process
       should be carried over until the end of the month, but keep in mind that the MIS cut-off
       date is the fourth day of the following month. In addition, the SARM will validate the
       EOM flying hour totals with Maintenance Operations Squadron (MOS) Plans,
       Scheduling, and Documentation (PS&D) not later than the third day after the close out of
       a given month.
       A2.4.7.3. (Added-PACAF) Once all flying hours/sorties have been validated and
       corrected for current month, squadron SARMs and MOS PS&D will sign the AUR and
       send their EOM flying hour reports to Wing Operations by the fifth day of each month
       for consolidation. Neither the SARM nor MOS PS&D will forward any flying hour
       reports to Wing Operations until the flying hours/sorties have been validated and
       corrected.

     rized non-crew in-flight duty
  To meet OFDA, ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP requirements, aircrew members must comply with
  the following:
     1. Log their flight time using both an aircrew certification code and position identifier
        valid to credit time (a “Yes” in column 3).
     2. Log primary, secondary or instructor flight time. Evaluator flight time is also
        creditable when the evaluator is current in the aircraft. Otherwise the evaluator should
        use the aircrew certification code O or X.
     3. Be attaining or maintaining qualification in the aircraft.
     4. Operational support fliers must log primary time to meet the requirement for HDIP.
        When not performing primary duties, they will log other time. Operational Support
        medical technicians on AOs will only log primary time when performing in-flight
        medical assistance to actual patients. Only other time is authorized for periods of the
        mission when medical assistance is not being provided. EXCEPTION: AFSPC and
        AETC medics will log primary time for that portion of the mission when they perform
        required temporary CEA duties on aircraft equipment (hoists and litters).
     5. Non-interference fliers (other than flying unit commanders) must receive HQ
        USAF/A3O-AT approval to log flying time on AFTO Form 781 and enter data into
        ARMS. See paragraphs 3.2.1.5.2 and 3.2.1.5.3.
     6. Rated officers and CEAs will log second character crew position Z when tasked to
        perform in-flight non-crew duties (e.g. safety observer). Include a remark on the back
        side of the AFTO Form 781 to explain the duty performed.
     7. Must receive HQ USAF/A3O-AT approval to log primary time on AFTO Form 781.
     8. Fifth character will be V for RPA Pilots and S for RPA Sensor Operators.
  Note: MAJCOMs may specify additional characters and may provide supplemental guidance.

                 ARMS AIRCREW/MISSION FLIGHT DATA EXTRACT

A3.1. Purpose. The AF Form 3520 is the source document for recording and reporting flight
training and space shuttle/space station information for each individual authorized to take part in
missions. This form is primarily used for aircrew members attending qualification school or
aircrew logging space time. Aircrew who fly operational missions off-station will use/make an
exact copy of the original AFTO Form 781, certify this as a true extract, and turn in the
form/copy to their HARM or SARM office for updating in ARMS. This is an official record to
validate flight pay eligibility for rated, CEA, and other non-rated officer and enlisted members
required to fly while TDY. This form will not be used for flights involving combat/combat
support operations. The original AF Form 3520,ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract,
must be maintained in the HARM office that services the unit to which the member is assigned.
This form is available for downloading on the Air Force e-Publishing website at www.e-
publishing.af.mil.
A3.2. Scope. The instructions listed on the reverse side of the AF Form 3520 apply to all rated,
CEA, and other non-rated officer and enlisted members authorized to log flight time while
attending training to attain qualification in an aircraft or training device and to log authorized
flights in non-USAF aircraft (includes space shuttle and space station) for the purpose of
maintaining an official Air Force Individual Flight Record. Source documents used to transfer
flight data from non-USAF aircraft are maintained as source documents IAW AFMAN 37-139.
Aircrew who fly operational missions on non-USAF aircraft will use an AFTO Form 781 to
document and record flight activities.
A3.3. Responsibilities. SARM/HARM office personnel are responsible for distributing and
collecting these forms. Completing the AF Form 3520 is a responsibility of the aircrew member.

aircraft for missions that originate and end at the same location. Use the AF Form 4327a to
authorize all other aircraft missions and for fighters/trainers (if desired). These are critical
documents used during mission review to validate duties performed/logged on the AFTO Form
781, and for reimbursement of temporary duty expenses. Forms are available for downloading on
the Air Force e-Publishing website at www.e-publishing.af.mil.
   A4.1.1. Additional members authorized to fly, who are not required to perform aircrew
   duties (except for noninterference fliers and MEP when specifically authorized [see
   paragraph A4.1.2]) must be listed on a passenger manifest.
   A4.1.2. The FA accounts for aircrew personnel required/authorized to perform in-flight
   aircrew duties and the passenger manifest lists all additional members approved to fly on the
   aircraft, but not performing specific aircrew duties on that mission. MEP and non-
   interference fliers not on AOs may be listed on the FA, in the Remarks section; if not listed
   on the FA, these individuals will be placed on the passenger manifest. The FA and passenger
   manifest combined account for all personnel on the aircraft.
   A4.1.3. Units may use computer-generated programs to produce AF Forms 4327/4327a in
   lieu of the actual form program. If used, computer-generated forms must duplicate AF forms
   located at the AFDPO e-publishing web site.
A4.2. Scope. These instructions apply to all flying unit commanders with operational control of
USAF aircraft who direct the use of aircraft and aircrews in support of command operations; and
AE, pararescue unit and ANG Senior Scout unit commanders who publish AE/PJ/Senior Scout
flight authorizations for aircrew members assigned to their units who are required to perform
aircrew duties on the mission.
A4.3. Responsibilities. AF Forms 4327 and 4327a are established by this instruction. Aviation
Resource Management personnel are responsible for publication of these forms and performing
Go/No-Go validation (review of ARMS products and member’s AOs) during pre-mission
review.
   A4.3.1. When additional aircrew members are added after completion of the FA, the
   authenticating official, pilot in command, or flight lead must confirm Go/No-Go
   requirements are accomplished by validating ARMS training products and AOs prior to
   flight.
   A4.3.2. The completed FA and the AFTO Form 781 will be used during post mission review
   to ensure proper documentation and accounting for all aircrew members authorized to
   perform duties. The pilot in command will document deviations between scheduled duties on
   the FA (Duty Position) and actual duties performed in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781.

   A4.3.3. The completed FA is normally filed with other mission paperwork. The Air Force
   Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) lists the minimum disposition requirements of this
   form. MAJCOM supplements may require longer retention times for the form.

                                Attachment 5 (Added-PACAF)
                      PACAF ORIENTATION FLIGHT GUIDELINES

A5.1. (Added-PACAF) General. Orientation flights are regulated by DoD 4515.13-R, Air
Transportation Eligibility. These flights are an exceptional use of USAF aircraft, flown only
when the benefits to the USAF are clearly established. These limited resources may be used to
familiarize selected passengers with aircraft capability and employment concepts, and to increase
public understanding and appreciation of USAF roles and missions. Direct all inquiries
concerning the PACAF Orientation Flight Program to HQ PACAF/A3TC, 25 E. ST SUITEG-
317, JBPH-H, HI 96853-5426, or telephone DSN 449-8990.
A5.2. (Added-PACAF) Orientation Flights. Orientation flights are a broad category of four
separate types of “exceptional use” flights: Incentive, Distinguished Visitor (DV),
Familiarization (FAM), and Spouse Orientation. Table 1.1. of the basic instruction, as
supplement by PACAF, lists orientation flight eligibility and approval authorities. The approval
authorities indicated have been delegated as listed. If a particular category is not listed, then the
approval authority has not been delegated. Approvals for incentive, DV and spouse orientation
flights are for a one-time flight only. Familiarization flight approvals may include periodic
flights (not to exceed 1 per calendar quarter), but local commanders will ensure specific learning
objectives for each mission are established. Develop local procedures to identify and outline
those objectives, and ensure they are met after each flight.
   A5.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Officers Awaiting PCS Training (APT). APT participants are
   Air Force active duty officers awaiting Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT).
   These personnel are specifically authorized to receive familiarization flights based on the
   level of preparatory training accomplished prior to such flights. They are authorized an
   unlimited number of familiarization flights, but only if such flights do not adversely effect
   unit “C” rating or create a backlog for other orientation flight programs. Although not
   specifically authorized to fly as MEPs, for administrative purposes, APT participants will be
   included on the Flight Authorization as “MEP.” These individuals will not be included on
   the AFTO Form 781, and will not log flight time.
A5.3. (Added-PACAF) Request Procedures. PACAF/A3TC is the OPR for processing and
directing all orientation flight requests whose approval authority is above NAF level. Requests
requiring approval above NAF level, and all requests requiring SAF/IA and/or foreign disclosure
coordination, must be staffed through the NAF/CC to HQ PACAF/A3TC. Requests requiring
PACAF/A3/5 approval must be received at least two weeks before the date of the proposed
flight. If PACAF/CC approval is required, request must be received at least three weeks prior to
the flight. If HHQ approval authority is required, request must be received at least 30 days prior
to flight. Requests not received within the specified time period will not be processed.
   A5.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Submit requests either via hard copy, or by electronic means,
   with an accompanying Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) in Electronic Staff Package (ESP) format.
   Orientation flight requests within PACAF will be submitted to PACAF/A3TC for staffing
   though HQ PACAF. The following minimum information must be on all requests, regardless
   of the level of approval required:
 118                                                 AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


       A5.3.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Name, grade, nationality, and position of the orientation
       candidates. Flights may be approved for well-defined groups if individual names are not
       known.
       A5.3.1.2. (Added-PACAF) Aircraft Type.
       A5.3.1.3. (Added-PACAF) Unit, location, and type of orientation flight requested (as
       defined in Table 1.1 of the basic AFI, and paragraph A5.2 of this guidance).
       A5.3.1.4. (Added-PACAF) Requested date or time period window for the flight. Allow
       sufficient time for flexibility in scheduling due to weather, distinguished visitor
       schedules, and aircraft availability. The time period window will not exceed six months
       for flights.
       A5.3.1.5. (Added-PACAF) Specific statement of benefit to the USAF or DoD.
       A5.3.1.6. (Added-PACAF) Other relevant comments, such as background of the
       orientation candidate (especially flying background), media coverage, unusual details of
       the planned mission, etc.
       A5.3.1.7. (Added-PACAF) Statement of specific learning objectives for any recurring
       familiarization flights (Reference A5.2.).
   A5.3.2. (Added-PACAF) Unless otherwise directed in this guidance, approvals for all
   categories of orientation flights are one-time only for a specific individual. If a cancelled
   flight (WX, MX, etc.) must be rescheduled for the same individual, re-approval within six
   months of the original signed approval is not required. Note: Requests approved below
   MAJCOM level will info the PACAF A3/5, CV, or CC as appropriate.
A5.4. (Added-PACAF) Operating Procedures-All Categories. The following applies to all
categories of orientation flights:
   A5.4.1. (Added-PACAF) Do not publicly offer flights or imply approval until the
   appropriate authority has formally approved the request. Orientation/Familiarization flights
   constitute official military duties for Active Duty, Guard and Reserve members. Due to line-
   of-duty considerations, do not allow any military individual to participate in
   orientation/familiarization flights while on leave, or permissive TDY.
   A5.4.2. (Added-PACAF) Provide orientation flights within approved flying hour program
   limitations. Whenever possible, include flights on regularly scheduled missions, however,
   orientation flights must not interfere with those missions. Fighter orientation flights should
   provide the best training opportunity possible while still keeping the intent of the orientation
   ride in mind. Under no circumstances will incentive orientation flight candidates be allowed
   on fighter sorties consisting of air combat training ((D)BFM, (D)ACM, (D)ACT), or air to
   ground training (BSA/SAT)) unless orientation candidates accomplish the appropriate
   ground training indicated in paragraph A5.4.7. Refer to the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS
   publication for specific definitions and restrictions covering air combat or surface attack
   missions.
   A5.4.3. (Added-PACAF) For flying in ejection seat aircraft, orientation candidates without
   a current AF Form 1042 (or national equivalent), must receive an AF Form 1042 from a
   flight surgeon no earlier than fourteen calendar days before the flight. Minor technically
   disqualifying defects may be subsequently waived by telephone coordination with HQ
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                         119


  PACAF Flight Medicine Branch (HQ PACAF/SGP). For non-ejection seat aircraft the
  individual will complete a locally generated health statement IAW AFI 48-123, Medical
  Examinations and Standards, paragraph 6.48.8. If civilian or they answer yes to any
  questions on the health statement, the health statement will be sent to the Flight Surgeons
  Office for review. See Attachment 12, from this supplement for a sample health statement.
  Individuals having successfully completed physiological training will be authorized to
  engage in familiarization/orientation flights above FL 180 in fighter aircraft.
  A5.4.4. (Added-PACAF) Brief all orientation flight passengers IAW the minimum
  Orientation Flight Passenger Briefing Guide. On multi-crew aircraft, the PIC may designate
  another qualified crew member to brief specific items, when the passenger will be under the
  supervision of that crew member (e.g., Loadmasters may brief emergency equipment and
  locations in the cargo compartment). All items will be briefed at the aircraft by the PIC or
  designated crew member. Where appropriate, brief these items after the passenger is
  strapped in.
  A5.4.5. (Added-PACAF) Ensure the passenger is properly strapped in and the oxygen
  system is properly configured and correctly connected. On multi-crew aircraft, the PIC may
  designate another qualified crew member to ensure the passenger is properly strapped in and
  the oxygen system is properly configured and connected anytime the passenger is connected
  to an oxygen system.
  A5.4.6. (Added-PACAF) If the PIC believes a passenger does not fully understand the
  emergency procedures, the passenger will not be allowed to fly.
  A5.4.7. (Added-PACAF) Ensure orientation candidates receive appropriate Aircrew Flight
  Equipment, and abbreviated survival training, as specified in AFI 11-301 PACAF SUP 1.
  Required Aircrew Flight Equipment training will be accomplished in certified training
  devices to the maximum extent possible. When a requirement for water survival training
  exists, “wet” immersion training will be provided if at all possible.
  A5.4.8. (Added-PACAF) In fighter aircraft, for a flight above FL 180, orientation
  candidates must have current physiological training according to AFI 11-403, Aerospace
  Physiological Training Program, or their national equivalent. (Not applicable for passenger
  carrying, airlift, or air refueling aircraft.)
  A5.4.9. (Added-PACAF) Prior to orientation flight, brief all orientation candidates on
  appropriate procedures, or have them attend the appropriate training. Individuals with
  current rated experience must provide current documentation of USAF, Sister Service, DoD,
  or national equivalent training, or re-accomplish these requirements.
  A5.4.10. (Added-PACAF) List all orientation candidates on DD Form 2131, Passenger
  Manifest. Orientation candidates travel in passenger status, but will report through the
  command and control center to the aircraft commander. This will expose the individual to
  pre- and post-flight procedures, helping them understand these critical processes. Do not
  place non-aircrew members on the flight authorization. Exception: Approved MEPs (in
  accordance with A6.3.3. of this guidance) and APT candidates. Include anti-hijacking
  protective measures according to AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting/Aircraft Piracy
  (Hijacking).

  A5.4.11. (Added-PACAF) The aircrew conducting the orientation flight must be highly
  qualified. At no time will an individual who is not qualified in the specific aircraft being
  flown occupy any pilot’s seat (with a set of controls) with passengers on board. If the
  orientation candidate is a Brigadier General (equivalent) or above, the aircraft commander
  must be an IP.
  A5.4.12. (Added-PACAF) In two-place aircraft, orientation candidates may occupy the
  right/rear seat as appropriate but will not be given control of an orientation aircraft unless the
  pilot has access to the controls and then only during non-critical phases of flight as defined in
  the applicable AFI 11-2MDS training publication. With an IP on board, rated general/flag
  officer pilots may fly the entire sortie in the front/left seat provided all of the following are
  accomplished: approved Senior Officer Course (if one exists), Bold Face/Critical Action
  Procedures (CAP) test (if applicable), appropriate normal/emergency landing procedures
  training in a simulator (if available).
  A5.4.13. (Added-PACAF) Critical Phases of Flight. In two place aircraft, no unqualified
  individual participating in an orientation flight will occupy a seat with controls.
      A5.4.13.1. (Added-PACAF) Non-Critical Phases of Flight. In two place aircraft,
      unqualified individuals participating in orientation flights may only occupy a seat with a
      set of controls once the aircraft is at altitude, and only with a highly experienced
      instructor pilot in the other seat. Refer to applicable AFI 11-2MDS training publication
      for exact definitions. IAW AFI 11-401, paragraph 1.9.4.7.1.4.4., under no circumstances
      will a spouse be given control of the aircraft.
  A5.4.14. (Added-PACAF) The mission and briefing will not exceed the clearance level of
  the individual receiving the orientation flight. Ensure foreign disclosure requirements
  concerning visit authorizations and disclosure of USAF information are satisfied for foreign
  national orientation flights IAW AFI 16-201, Air Force Foreign Disclosure and Technology
  Transfer Program. Contact HQ PACAF/A2XI at DSN 449-4149 for any questions
  concerning foreign disclosure.
  A5.4.15. (Added-PACAF) Additional Operating Procedures – Civilians and Non-rated
  Individuals: The following additional restrictions apply to all civilians and non-rated
  individuals:
      A5.4.15.1. (Added-PACAF) Plan and execute mission profiles in a low risk
      environment with the exception of takeoff and landing. The enroute portion of the flight
      will not be flown below 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL) (500 ft AGL for C-130s).
      On Incentive flights, mechanically safe guns and download all film and external
      ordnance.
      A5.4.15.2. (Added-PACAF) Incentive flights in fighter aircraft will not involve air
      combat training ((D)BFM, (D)ACM, (D)ACT), or air to ground training (BSA/SAT)).
      Refer to the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS publication for specific definitions covering air
      combat or surface attack missions.
      A5.4.15.3. (Added-PACAF) Conduct Incentive flights to avoid abrupt, unexpected
      maneuvers and high G-loading.
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                          121


      A5.4.15.4. (Added-PACAF) Squadron Top Three must ensure pilots flying incentive
      flights receive adequate briefings to emphasize that the sortie objective is to reward
      and/or provide an incentive. Conduct missions so as not to overwhelm the observer and
      thus render the effort useless.
      A5.4.15.5. (Added-PACAF) Thoroughly brief all orientation candidates on all aspects
      of the flight to alleviate apprehension. Provide in-flight advisories to the orientation
      candidate to achieve the same objective.
      A5.4.15.6. (Added-PACAF) Civilian passengers aboard Air Force aircraft are
      prohibited from “Flying” or manipulating the controls of the aircraft to include on-board
      systems such as air refueling booms.
      A5.4.15.7. (Added-PACAF) Following each flight, the SARM will return a copy of the
      completed checklist to their respective current operations section for accounting
      purposes. Current operations will maintain a log along with all completed flight
      checklist, AF Form 1042, AF Form 702 (if applicable), and AF Form 1522 (documenting
      egress training completed for passengers) for six months after flight completion.
   A5.4.16. (Added-PACAF) Spouse Orientation Flights will not be conducted in fighter,
   bomber, or two-seat trainer aircraft, however, Spouse Taxi Rides are authorized in fighter
   aircraft as an alternative. Limited to spouses of the following USAF military personnel:
   aircrew members, flight authorized crew chiefs, flight authorized mission-support personnel,
   and critical specialties in direct support of flying operations. The OG/CC determines
   personnel considered critical specialties and will not expand the program to an all-skills
   program for all members.
      A5.4.16.1. (Added-PACAF) Spouse Orientation Flights in non-fighter aircraft may be
      accomplished IAW the provisions of AFI 11-401, paragraph 1.9.4.7.1.4. and Table 1.1.
      Approval to accomplish Spouse Orientation Flights has been delegated at the WG/CC
      level by PACAF/A3/5 directive, and will not be delegated any lower.
A5.5. (Added-PACAF) Spouse Taxi-Ride Program.
   A5.5.1. (Added-PACAF) Aircraft (including fighter aircraft) not appropriate for spouse
   orientation flights may be used in a spouse taxi-ride program. Limited to spouses of the
   following USAF military personnel: aircrew members, flight authorized crew chiefs, flight
   authorized mission-support personnel, and critical specialties in direct support of flying
   operations. The OG/CC determines personnel considered critical specialties and will not
   expand the program to an all-skills program for all members. Spouses of USAF military
   personnel in non-PACAF units collocated with PACAF units are eligible to participate in the
   program.
   A5.5.2. (Added-PACAF) Requirements:
      A5.5.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Candidates will complete appropriate Aircrew Flight
      Equipment training before the taxi ride.
      A5.5.2.2. (Added-PACAF) Outfit participants with flight dress uniforms, gloves, jacket
      (if required), helmet, oxygen mask, or headset (as appropriate). Wear shoes adequate to
      provide necessary support for possible emergency ground egress.

      appropriate hot brakes/wheels inspections (as required) between taxi trips.
  A5.5.3. (Added-PACAF) ORM considerations are as followed:
      A5.5.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Use full runway length (e.g., 10,000', which means the jet
      will have about 8,500' to slow from 100 KIAS back to taxi speed).
      A5.5.3.2. (Added-PACAF) Have only internal fuel in the aircraft to lessen gross
      weight.
      A5.5.3.3. (Added-PACAF) Plan should call for 1+15 of turn time for each jet between
      taxi evolutions to allow brakes to cool.
      A5.5.3.4. (Added-PACAF) No classified information will be released.

                        MISSION ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL (MEP)

A6.1. (Added-PACAF) Definition. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP): are individuals who
are required for the execution of the aircraft or unit mission, to include follow-on missions. MEP
includes additional aircrew members and other personnel not authorized AOs who are tasked to
perform ground support duties at en route locations or destination points that are directly related
and essential to accomplishment of the aircraft or unit mission, e.g., a specialist or technician
required to provide aircraft support or a security team required to guard the aircraft. MEP may
include military staff personnel when required to accompany a senior officer and U.S.
Government employees when those individuals are required for the mission. Civilian contractors
will only be authorized MEP status if the Air Force is required to provide airlift as stipulated in
individual employment or company contracts. Foreign nationals (military or civilian) are not
authorized MEP status unless they are approved and participating in the military exchange
programs described in AFI 16-107, Military Personnel Exchange Program and assigned to
USAF units.
A6.2. (PACAF) Responsibility. HQ PACAF/A3T is responsible for oversight of the MEP
program.
   A6.2.1. (Added-PACAF) MEP, to include additional crewmembers who fly in MEP status,
   are passengers and may only fly in aircraft capable of carrying passengers in accordance with
   the provisions of the basic instruction, and DoD 4515.13R, Air Transportation Eligibility,
   MEP status does not require physical or physiological training. They are not authorized to
   log time in the aircraft, nor are they entitled to flying incentive pay. MEP travel in passenger
   status, are manifested using a DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest, but will report through
   the command and control center to the aircraft commander. Include anti-hijacking protective
   measures according to AFI 13-207. Limit the number of MEPs to the minimum necessary to
   complete the unit’s mission. MEPs are authorized flight deck seating with aircraft
   commander approval. Do not use MEP status as a substitute for point-to-point travel
   requirements (see DoD 4515.13R, Air Transportation Eligibility, for Space-A duty passenger
   requirements). Commanders will ensure that MEP status is not used for travel at a higher
   priority than, or in lieu of regular passenger travel, for avoidance of travel expenses, or for
   travel while on leave. Do not bump MEPs en route without PACAF/AMOCC,
   PACAF/TACC, or Director Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFOR) approval. Do not use MEP
   status to provide blanket approval for recurring familiarization flights. Strictly control and
   approve MEP travel status for those with a bona fide mission essential purpose.
   A6.2.2. (Added-PACAF) Further guidance or restrictions concerning specific conditions of
   MEP presence on-board the aircraft will be the responsibility of individual AFI 11-2MDS
   series publications, as supplemented by the MAJCOM.
A6.3. (Added-PACAF) Approval Authority.
   A6.3.1. (Added-PACAF) The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the
   aircraft being flown approves MEP status on a case-by-case basis (each flight or mission).
   This includes any HQ PACAF or NAF Staff personnel or sister-service members. Blanket
   approval is not authorized. HQ PACAF/A3T approves civilian members of other U.S.
 124                                                AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


   federal agencies for MEP status on passenger capable aircraft when supporting PACAF
   missions (e.g., simulated survivors for CSAR exercises with en route ground-based duties).
A6.3.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Air Mobility Division (AMD) Contractors are authorized to
occasionally fly on PACAF mobility aircraft to obtain familiarity with the flying environment as
Mission Essential Personnel (MEP). AMD Contractors will be designated as MEP on an
approval memorandum prior to each mission. PACAF/A3T is the approval authority. AMD
Contractors will present the approved memo to the unit flying the mission to have their names
added to the flight authorization. Flying time and training is not authorized to be logged or
updated in ARMS.
   A6.3.2. (Added-PACAF) Procedures. Submit requests for MEP status either via hard
   copy, or by electronic means to pacaf.a3t@us.af.mil see attachment 8 and 9. Requests
   requiring MAJCOM approval must be accompanied by a Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) in the
   Electronic Staff Package (ESP) format. Forward requests to the approving agency at least
   ten days prior to the expected date of flight(s). Include name, rank, organization, reason for
   travel, proposed itinerary, and dates. Ensure routing includes appropriate HQ PACAF
   agency staffing prior to arriving at PACAF/A3T. Failure to include appropriate staffing will
   result in a delay in processing and/or possible failure to approve request in a timely manner.
   A6.3.3. (Added-PACAF) Orders. Cite MEP approval in TDY travel orders, or approval
   authority letter. The following is an example statement: “MEP status is authorized by
   (appropriate OG/CC, or PACAF/A3T) on (aircraft number or mission number, exercise or
   contingency name) for or between (duration, i.e., 22-27 June 2009).” End the statement with
   name and phone number of individual approving MEP status. MEP authority may also be
   cited in a letter or message using this statement. (Note: Approved MEPs may be placed on
   the Flight Authorization in the “Remarks” section only for the purpose of maintaining
   billeting and transportation integrity with the aircrew only. They will not be annotated on the
   AFTO Form 781).
   A6.3.4. (Added-PACAF) Coordination of MEP travel. Individuals will coordinate their
   travel with the appropriate current operations function prior to travel. It is imperative that
   mission operators and air terminal operations centers are aware of MEP requirements when
   scheduling missions and crews. Individuals joining missions en route will present their travel
   orders to the appropriate PACAF command and control agency at least three hours prior to
   intended travel. Medical MEPs anticipating travel on aeromedical evacuation missions
   require prior approval from the Aeromedical Evacuation Control Center (AECC).
   A6.3.5. (Added-PACAF) Aircrew Procedures. With the concurrence of the aircraft
   commander and seats permitting, MEP may be seated on the flight deck/crew compartment
   during takeoff and landing, to include touch-and-go landings. Simulated emergencies, to
   include no-flap landings, with MEPs on-board are prohibited. Crews must be prepared to
   include MEPs on a DD Form 2131 and provide force protection measures (anti-hijacking)
   screening when passenger service is not available.

SUBJECT: Indoctrination Flyer Request

1. Request approval for Major Marissa R. Miller, XXX-XX-XXXX as an Indoctrination flyer
effective for the period of 3 November 2011 through 27 May 2012.

2. Major Miller is an Electronic Warfare Officer, currently assigned to an inactive, API 4
position. Major Miller is the lead project officer on the ALQ-47 pod upgrade system. Allowing
her to fly on all the test missions would enable her to perform operational function tests of the
system. She has a current physical and altitude chamber. Member will log “XW” and other
time.

Example 2: Commanders or branch chiefs could also identify an inactive rated/CEA position to
be a continuous indoctrination position. For instance: an inactive training officer position in
PACAF/A3T to maintain familiarity of the flying environment, to enhance ability to maintain
knowledge to effectively write MAJCOM flying instructions.
