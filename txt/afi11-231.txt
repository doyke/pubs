                                           INTRODUCTION


1.1. General. This instruction provides information for computed air release systems for airdrop of
equipment and personnel.

1.2. Applicability. This instruction applies to all US Air Force aircrew members directly involved in
computing air release points for airdrop operations of parachutists, equipment, supply bundles, and train-
ing bundles. HQ AMC is the lead command for this instruction. Individual major commands (MAJCOM)
may supplement and waive elements of this instruction for operational necessity. Send information per-
taining to any supplement or waiver to this instruction to the lead command as soon as practical. Individ-
ual MAJCOMs will be responsible for providing HQ AMC ballistic data specific to their command or
mission. Additionally, all lead MAJCOMs must identify which items in this AFI apply to their aircrews
for use in their specific mission. Note: Some aircraft are capable of computing wind adjusted release
points solutions through onboard mission computers without the use of procedures contained in the
instruction.

1.3. Administration. Organization commanders will ensure distribution of one copy per aircrew mem-
ber who is directly involved in calculating air release points and one copy per operations section of air-
drop tasked units. Holders are responsible for posting revisions and changes.

1.4. Recommended Changes. Use AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication,
according to AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program (FMP), to recommend a change to this instruction.
All AF Forms 847 must be approved by HQ AMC/DOV, through respective MAJCOM channels.

1.5. Deviations. Deviations to this instruction are authorized for safety or protection of aircrew or air-
craft. As soon as possible, inform respective MAJCOM of reason for deviation and course of action taken.
For other types of deviation, submit waiver requests through normal channels to respective MAJCOM.
File approved waivers in the back of this instruction until expired or rescinded.

1.6. Individual Circular Error Record (does not apply to AFSOC or C-17 units). Each unit will
maintain Circular Error (CE) records for aircrew members (primarily navigators) who are responsible for
CARP computations and who initiate the airdrop sequence. Use AF Form 4012, Individual Air Drop
Circular Error Record. Compute a separate CEA for each category listed below. Use the last ten (10)
airdrops for each category or those recorded within the last six months (whichever is less). Record a drop
score over 600 yards as a 600 yards Circular Error Average (CEA). Aircrew members, defined in this
paragraph, must receive supervised training if their CEA exceeds 225 yards. Confirmed equipment mal-
functions, troop exit delays, releases not controlled by the aircrew (such as jumpmaster directed airdrops),
and racetracks will not be included in the computations. Use the following categories:
    1.6.1. Actual personnel - visual day and night separately.
    1.6.2. Actual heavy equipment - visual day and night separately.
    1.6.3. Actual Container Delivery System (CDS) - visual day and night separately.

   1.6.4. Standard Airdrop Training Bundle (SATB) - visual day and night reported together.
   1.6.5. Zone Marker or SKE timing - all.
   1.6.6. AWADS or AUTOCARP - all.

NOTES:
  Included SATBs released on actual CARPs for sight angle training in the appropriate actual load com-
  putations.
   Units may track CEAs for pilots flying the aircraft as well as by tail numbers (to determine or verify
   trends in alignment or equipment performance).

1.7. Successful Airdrop Criteria:
   1.7.1. Unilateral training. Successful criteria is governed by applicable MAJCOM instructions or sup-
   plements.
   1.7.2. Other than unilateral training. Score airdrop events as successful if 90 percent of the loads land
   within the boundaries of the surveyed DZ and are recovered in usable condition by friendly forces.

                        COMPUTED AIR RELEASE POINT (CARP) SYSTEM


2.1. General. The CARP solution is based on average parachute ballistics and fundamental dead reckon-
ing principles. These principles, laid out in this instruction, minimize errors while providing ease of pre-
flight and inflight mission planning.

2.2. Responsibility. The aircrew member who initiates the airdrop sequence computes the release point
solution for all airdrops. The actual computation of the computed release point may be accomplished for
a formation by a designated qualified aircrew member. However, each individual aircrew is responsible
for its accuracy. The pilot flying the aircraft assumes responsibility for maintaining drift offset and
required track during run-in. The navigator (or pilot not flying the aircraft when a navigator is not part of
the crew) controls the time to airdrop sequence initiation, “Green Light.” This crewmember also controls
the end of usable drop zone time “Red Light” and updates the required drift offset for the pilot to fly. Air-
crew members must have a thorough understanding of this system. Complete cooperation and teamwork
between these crew positions is essential for best results. Exception: HC-130 unique airdrops maybe ini-
tiated IAW mission specific procedures.
Exception: C-17 Procedures. The C-17 utilizes an onboard mission computer (MC) system to compute a
CARP solution. Both pilots are responsible for ensuring all computer entries are correct. The MC controls
the time to airdrop sequence initiation, “Green Light.” It also controls the end of usable drop zone time,
“Red Light,” and updates the required drift offset for the pilot to fly.

2.3. Methods of Airdrop.
     2.3.1. Personnel and Door Bundle. This type of airdrop load either exits, is pushed, or is skidded from
     the paratroop door or aircraft ramp and door.
     2.3.2. Gravity. The aircraft maintains a “nose-high” attitude (if required) and inflight release of load
     restraint allows the load to roll out of the aircraft. A rigging system may be used to initiate and accel-
     erate load movement.
     2.3.3. Extraction. An extraction parachute pulls the load from the cargo compartment.

2.4. Types of Airdrop.
     2.4.1. Free-Fall. Delivery of non-fragile items without the use of parachutes. Loads require special
     preparation to prevent damage from impact.
     2.4.2. High Velocity (Hi-V). Delivery of certain supply items rigged in containers with an energy dis-
     sipater attached to the underside and supported by a ring-slot parachute. The ring-slot parachute stabi-
     lizes the load and retards the rate of fall to the point of acceptable landing shock. This system may
     include equipment loads dropped using reefed parachutes.
     2.4.3. Low Velocity. Delivery of personnel and various items of supply and equipment by use of
     cargo parachutes. Loads are prepared for airdrop by packing items in airdrop containers or by rigging
     them on platforms.
AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                                  11


2.5. Governing Factors:
   2.5.1. The CARP is based on the first load to exit the aircraft (Exception: When door bundles precede
   personnel, compute separate CARPs for the personnel and for the bundle. Release the bundle on the
   personnel CARP after ensuring that the bundle will impact on the surveyed DZ).
   2.5.2. The actual ground pattern of sequentially airdropped loads depends on the following:
       2.5.2.1. Time lapse between “Green Light” and time of exit of last item.
       2.5.2.2. Aircraft stability from release to “Red Light.”
       2.5.2.3. Uniformity of loads and/or parachutes within an element.
       2.5.2.4. Glide angle of individual parachutes.
       2.5.2.5. Ability of jumper to see desired landing point and steer to it.
       2.5.2.6. Aircraft track from “Green Light” to “Red Light”
       2.5.2.7. Aircraft altitude and speed.
       2.5.2.8. Weather (primarily winds).
   2.5.3. Accurate airdrop requires timely drop zone or drop zone target acquisition to assure proper
   alignment. The alignment or cross track drift offset, based on the most current winds, must be main-
   tained during the final approach to the release point and throughout the drop period.

2.6. Parachute Characteristics:
   2.6.1. Parachute Ballistics. Each parachute has its own peculiarities. The ballistics given in this
   instruction are acceptable averages. This testing is conducted by the US Army Airborne Board, US
   Army Quartermaster Corps, and US Army Natick Laboratories. USAF Aeronautical Systems Center
   at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base validates the tested ballistics for aircrew use.
   2.6.2. Gliding Angle. Some parachutes (e.g., T-10) glide randomly in direction. Others (e.g., MT-1)
   are designed to glide in one direction. Unless the direction and speed of the glide are known, this fac-
   tor cannot be accounted for in the CARP.

2.7. Drop Winds. Use a composite of altitude and surface winds (if known) to determine drift effect. The
most accurate drop wind is one obtained at drop altitude and airspeed shortly before the drop. When inter-
polating a mean effective wind (vectorial average from all sources), take care to consider direction as well
as velocity, and consider weather or other phenomena that may cause wind shear between drop altitude
and the surface. Remember, the higher the drop altitude, the greater the drift effect per knot of wind. Note:
When averaging winds to arrive at a ballistic wind, use a vectorial wind average. Using a mathematical
average will introduce errors into the CARP solution. Wind sources include, but are not limited to the fol-
lowing:
   2.7.1. Forecast winds.
NOTE: Weather facilities report winds in true bearing.
   2.7.2. Inflight visual indications of wind (smoke, dust, etc.).
   2.7.3. Electronic and navigation systems (Doppler, SCNS, INS, GPS, LIDAR, etc.).
12                                                                        AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005


     2.7.4. Ground party (CCT, STT, and DZC) furnished magnetic winds. Normally, the ground party
     reports winds as a Mean Effective Wind (MEW). The MEW is a theoretical wind, referenced in con-
     stant speed and direction, extending from the DZ surface to drop altitude. When verified with inflight
     data, aircrews should consider the MEW a very desirable source.

2.8. Drop Zones. AFI 13-217, Assault Zone Procedures, Chapter 2 contains DZ information.

                           COMPUTED AIR RELEASE POINT SOLUTIONS


3.1. General. The primary solution for computing the air release point is the basic computer solution
where all requirements are solved using the MB-4 or MAJCOM approved computer software. Note: For
C-17 operations, all computations are stored in the computer and no paper documentation is required.
Chute ballistic data is contained in a database within the MC.

3.2. Basic Computed Air Release Point (CARP) Solutions (Does not apply to C-17). The AF Form
4018, Computed Air Release Point Computation, or MAJCOM approved software generate products,
will be used to solve and record data. Figure 3.1. provides sample CARP solutions for CDS, Heavy
Equipment and Personnel. The basic steps for the AF Form 4018 are as follows:
     3.2.1. Item 1. Drop altitude: Selected AGL drop altitude (absolute altitude) in feet.
     3.2.2. Item 2. Terrain Elevation: Elevation, in feet, of the highest point on the surveyed DZ.
     3.2.3. Item 3. True Altitude: Computed mean sea level (MSL) drop altitude, in feet (item 1 plus item
     2). True altitude is the altitude to be flown when the altimeter setting is derived by in-flight altimeter
     calibration.
     3.2.4. Item 4. Pressure Altitude Variation (PAV): The pressure difference, in feet, between mean sea
     level and the standard datum plane. PAV is computed by taking the difference between the forecast DZ
     altimeter setting and the standard day pressure (29.92 in Hg) and multiplying by 10. PAV is positive if
     the forecast altimeter setting is less than 29.92 and negative if the forecast altimeter setting is greater
     than 29.92 (formula A).
     3.2.5. Item 5. Pressure Altitude: Drop altitude, in feet above the standard datum plane (item 3 plus
     item 4). Used to compute true airspeed and corrected drop altitude.
     3.2.6. Item 6. Corrected Drop Altitude: Drop altitude corrected for air density by using formula B and
     the ALTITUDE CALCULATIONS window on the MB-4 computer.
         True Alt Temp =            Drop Altitude
         Pressure Altitude       (Corrected Drop Altitude)
     3.2.7. Item 7. Terrain Elevation: Same as item 2.
     3.2.8. Item 8. Indicated Altitude: The altitude to be flown with the DZ altimeter setting set in the
     barometric scale of the aircraft altimeter.
     3.2.9. Item 9. True Altitude Temperature: Temperature in degrees Celsius. Used to compute item 6
     and item 11.
     3.2.10. Item 10. IAS/CAS/EAS: Indicated airspeed (IAS) for the drop as specified by the appropriate
     directives. Calibrated airspeed (CAS) equals IAS corrected for pitot static error, aircraft attitude, and
     instrument error. Equivalent airspeed (EAS) equals CAS corrected for compressibility. Log CAS/EAS
     only when different from IAS.
     3.2.11. Item 11. True Airspeed: True airspeed (TAS) is computed on the MB-4 using the DENSITY
     ALTITUDE COMPUTATIONS window and the formula:
AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                                  15


         Temperature = (TAS)
         Pressure Altitude EAS
   3.2.12. Item 12. Rate of Fall (RF): Extracted from the parachute ballistic data. This velocity is
   expressed in feet per second.

3.3. Plotting Instructions. Using any drop zone mosaic, plot the drift effect upwind from the PI. Plot the
forward travel distance back-track from the end of the drift effect vector, parallel to the run-in course. The
end of this plot is the CARP. The reverse may also be used. Plot the forward travel distance back along DZ
run-in axis. Then plot the drift effect vector from the end of forward travel distance vector. The end of this
combined vector is the CARP (Figure 3.2.). Chapter 4 details other means of plotting CARPs.

               ALTERNATIVE COMPUTED AIR RELEASE POINT SOLUTIONS


4.1. General. With the development of new equipment and procedures, additional methods of CARP
solutions have been designed. Four modified CARP solutions and aids are the wind circle, Doppler Grid
and Circle Overlay, and AF Form 4014. Alternate methods of updating CARP inflight, including tech-
niques for wind analysis and T-CARP constant-angle timing, are included in this chapter. These solutions
incorporate special techniques and tabulated data as aids to expedite the solution of the final CARP when
close-in to the DZ.
   4.1.1. All personnel involved in airdrop must realize aerial delivery using a CARP system is not an
   exact science. The system permits revisions close to the DZ and takes into considerations winds at
   various levels through which the parachute and load pass. When the aircrew member has a graphic
   presentation of the wind vectors and understands the characteristics of the parachutes used, they are
   better able to estimate the best release point.
   4.1.2. Aircrew should be alert for changes in surface and altitude winds in the vicinity of the DZ.
   Often it is possible to spot a wind shear by observing a column of smoke. Information on winds at the
   different levels may not always be available. If not, the aircrew member still can use the best known
   drop altitude and surface winds.
   4.1.3. Last minute CARP changes may preclude detailed study of the CARP track by the pilot. The
   aircrew member should be prepared to give directions and assist the pilot flying the aircraft in estab-
   lishing the desired cross track drift offset.

4.2. AF Form 4013 Modified CARP Solution. Use the AF Form 4013, Modified CARP Solution, or
MAJCOM approved software for modified CARP solutions. The AF Form 4013 is based on a forward
travel computation and the formula D=KAV, where D is the drift effect in yards/meters, K is an average
constant value for the type load being airdropped, A is the drop altitude in feet AGL divided by 1000, and
V is the ballistic wind velocity in knots. The AF Form 4013 is designed primarily to provide all the data
required for an airdrop mission computer (SCNS, INS, GPS, etc.). Figure 4.1., provides an example of a
filled-in AF Form 4013:

4.3. AF Form 4014, Grid Overlay Plotter, Solution.
AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                                   21


   4.3.1. Description. AF Form 4014 is a clear plastic overlay depicting both grid plotter and generic
   wind circle cut-outs. The generic wind circle contains two rings scaled to match both the timing graph
   and the sight angle tables on AF Form 4018 (Reverse). The outer ring is marked with azimuth lines at
   30 degrees intervals. At the center of the inner circle is a dot used to position the wind circle correctly
   on AF Form 4018 (Reverse).
   4.3.2. Use of the grid plotter is prescribed later in this instruction. To use the wind circles, clip out
   along the dotted line. The loose wind circles can now be overlaid on the AF Form 4018 (Reverse).
   Using either side of the AF Form 4018, measure FTD back from the depicted PI. Place the dot in the
   center of the wind circles on this point. Turn the wind circles so the surveyed DZ course (on the cir-
   cles) is overlaid along the DZ axis (depicted on the AF Form 4018). Magnetic or true course can be
   used depending on whether the aircrew member is using magnetic or true winds to plot the CARP Plot
   the drift effect along the wind azimuth. This is your CARP. Converting the CARP to an elapsed time
   or a sight angle is discussed in paragraph 4.4.

NOTES:
  The wind circles are calibrated to multiples of 400 yards on the timing graph and multiples of 200
  yards on the sight angle graph. Use caution when interpolating drift effect.
   Use formula H (AF Form 4018, CARP Computation). The wind circle size can be converted to a wind
   speed for ease of inflight plotting.

4.4. Inflight use of AF Form 4018 (Reverse). AF Form 4018 (Reverse) allows for inflight CARP deter-
mination. This form depicts a generic drop zone mosaic modified with the addition of a timing graph. The
from is designed to be used with the wind circle cut-out from AF Form 4014.
   4.4.1. Timing Graph.
       4.4.1.1. Plot the PI location on the depicted DZ axis so the bottom of the DZ grid equates to the
       selected timing point (distance from bottom of grid to block letter equals distance from selected
       timing point to surveyed PI).
       4.4.1.2. Plot the CARP in accordance with para. 4.3.
       4.4.1.3. Along a line perpendicular to the DZ axis, move the CARP to the column on the right
       equating to the aircraft groundspeed.
       4.4.1.4. Proceed diagonally along the timing lines to obtain the stopwatch timing. Interpolate
       between whole seconds. Result is the elapsed time from the selected timing point to the release
       point.
NOTE: If the AF Form 4014 overlay is not available, plot the drift effect from the PI location and deter-
mine a raw time in accordance with 4.4.1.3. and 4.4.1.4. above. Subtract forward travel time from raw
time to obtain stopwatch time.

4.5. Wind Circle Solution. The wind circle solution is designed to permit the aircrew member to evalu-
ate wind conditions very close to the DZ and at levels other than drop altitude. All work in constructing
the wind circle is done on the ground. The drift effect for three or more wind velocities (usually 10, 20 and
30 knots) is drawn on the DZ depiction centered on the point of impact, or on the FTD plot. Wind circles
may also be constructed using any convenient distance increment (usually 200 yards). A true or magnetic
22                                                                          AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005


north arrow is drawn through the center of the circle with azimuth lines, normally at 30 degree incre-
ments, around the circle to facilitate speedy plotting of wind directions. In-flight, the aircrew member
determines winds, plots them on the wind circle, and applies FTD (if required) to provide an instanta-
neous CARP. It is possible to completely re-evaluate the CARP inside the one-minute advisory.
     4.5.1. Preflight
        4.5.1.1. Select a properly scaled DZ chart, photograph or drawing. The wind circle may be drawn
        on clear acetate or similar material for reproduction. These reproductions may be attached to DZ
        photos for in-flight use.
        4.5.1.2. Complete the AF Form 4018. TTF is needed to construct the wind circle, except when
        constant wind circle spacing is used.
        4.5.1.3. Determine the drift effect for a 10 knot wind using the formula:
                  TTF    =   (Drift Effect)
                  1.78           10
        4.5.1.4. Draw circles on the DZ depiction representing the drift effect for selected wind velocities
        up to 40 knots. Wind circles should be centered on the PI. It may be centered on the FTD plot, but
        an error is induced along the run-in axis for any in-flight change from the original preflight value
        of groundspeed used to make the plot. Even though small errors (2.8 yards each second of FTT for
        each 5 knots change in preflight CARP groundspeed) are induced by positioning the wind circles
        on the FTD plot, such errors may be acceptable in relation to possible plotting and computation
        errors made possible by attempting to do so inflight.
        4.5.1.5. Draw azimuth lines from the PI or FTD plot outward to the outer circle each 30 degrees
        or selected increment. Label each with the appropriate value. Magnetic values are desirable since
        DZCT winds are passed as magnetic values.
        4.5.1.6. Label the DZ depiction or acetate overlay with the constants used to construct the wind
        circles; i.e., type parachute, load weight, TTF, or size of constant wind circles used. The aircrew
        member should always recompute the CARP before each mission to verify the wind values.
        4.5.1.7. Plot the preflight drift effect from the PI or FTD plot.
        4.5.1.8. Measure the distance from the end of the drift effect plot or the CARP to the timing line
        and convert to time using the preflight groundspeed. If the wind circle is centered on the FTD plot,
        the result is the timing point time. If the wind circle is centered on the PI, subtract the FTT from
        this time. The result is the timing point time.
     4.5.2. In-Flight Wind Determination.
        4.5.2.1. The wind circle allows aircrew members to average and plot a number of different winds
        with relative ease and speed. These include surface, intermediate, mean-effective, drop altitude,
        forecast, and estimated winds. The aircrew member is encouraged to obtain and plot several winds
        from different sources in order to get the best picture possible of actual wind conditions. The deci-
        sion on which wind or combination of winds to use is up to the individual. Aircrew members must
        insure they compute drop altitude drift and groundspeed for line up and timing. During combat
        conditions, drift effect is normally plotted based on an average of surface wind indications and
        navigation computer readouts.

  4.5.3. Sample Problem:
     4.5.3.1. Figure 4.2. was constructed using the following information from an AF Form 4018
     computation:
        4.5.3.1.1. Parachute - T-10.

        4.5.3.1.4. FTT - 3.2 secs
        4.5.3.1.5. Ballistic wind - 200o/20 knots
        4.5.3.1.6. Groundspeed - 110 knots
     4.5.3.2. The drift effect for a 10 knot wind equals 289 yards.

4.6. Grid Overlay Solution. The grid overlay solution is a mathematically derived, visual presentation
for rapid computation of a CARP in-flight. Its use is preceded by completing the CARP computations, AF
Form 4018. Small deviations from preflight values computed are acceptable. Wind information (GS and
drift), obtained at and below drop altitude, can be used to compute the in-flight CARP. After the final
slowdown and arrival at drop altitude, the CARP can be reconfirmed or adjusted for winds over the DZ.
The basic idea of the solution is to provide the aircrew member an instantaneous CARP for any combina-
tion of head/tail winds and drift effect.
   4.6.1. Preflight:
       4.6.1.1. Complete the AF Form 4018. TTF, FTT, and aircraft TAS are needed to construct the
       overlay.
       4.6.1.2. Determine the cross track drift effect offset, in yards, for two degrees of drift using the
       "AC" constant, see Figure 4.3. for the values, and the formula:
                Chord("AC")       =     (2o Offset Distance)
                  1.78                       TTF
              (1.94 for meters)
       4.6.1.3. Determine the head/tail wind effect distance, in yards, for 5 knots of wind using the for-
       mula:
                  5 = (Head/Tail Wind Distance)
                1.78         TTF + FTT
NOTE: FTT is added to compensate for changes in the forward travel vector caused by changes in
groundspeed.
       4.6.1.4. Select a properly scaled DZ depiction to be used for the airdrop. Insure that all plots use
       the corresponding scale. Grid overlays may be drawn on clear acetate or similar material for repro-
       duction. These reproductions may be attached to DZ photos for in-flight use.
       4.6.1.5. Plot the FTD based on drop TAS using the formula:
               TAS = (FTD)
               1.78  FTT
       4.6.1.6. Starting with the FTD plot, mark the desired number of 5 knot head/tail wind distance
       fore and aft of this plot on the run-in axis. A maximum wind circle may be drawn to determine the
       size desired; however, five in each direction normally are drawn. Graduations (see (A), Figure
       4.4. ) are provided to measure the distance between plots and leading edge of the grid overlay plot-
       ter as a guide for drawing the groundspeed lines.
NOTE: Drift angle is accurate only at drop airspeed. The 5kt groundspeed increments represent differ-
ences from "CARPed" true airspeed. When off true airspeed a reasonably accurate correction can be made
by applying planned and actual true airspeed differences to the actual groundspeed.
       4.6.1.7. On a line perpendicular to the run-in axis and running through one of the head/tail wind
       plots, mark the desired number, normally five, of the 2o offset distances on each side of the axis.
       The graduations/lines, (see (B), Figure 4.4.) are provided for measuring and drawing the lines.

Figure 4.4. GRID Overlay Sample.




       4.6.1.8. Complete the grid overlay, as shown in Figure 4.4., using the grid overlay plotter.
NOTE: The grid overlay may be drawn using dividers to mark all plots (see (C), Figure 4.4.), and the
standard air navigation plotter to draw in the lines. Groundspeed lines are 5o from the perpendicular to the
run-in axis (see (D), Figure 4.4.).
       4.6.1.9. The line through the FTD plot is a zero head/tail wind effect line and will be labeled with
       the computed drop TAS (for any CARP on this line, GS = TAS) or with "0" head/tail wind effect.
       Succeeding lines will be labeled with the appropriate groundspeed, in 5 knot increments, or with
       the appropriate head/tail wind effect (i.e., -5, -10, +5, +10, etc.).
NOTE: Labeling head/tail wind effect lines with groundspeed increments normally is the most desirable.
It eliminates conversion of Doppler readouts into TAS - GS differences, thereby making last second
changes to the timing problem simple by having to monitor only a single instrument.
       4.6.1.10. Label each parallel drift offset line with the appropriate offset value. Care must be taken
       to label with the correct +/- drift correction (left drift to the right of the DZ and vice versa).
       4.6.1.11. Label the grid overlay with the constants used in its construction; Type parachute, load

     4.6.2. Sample Problem. Information used in drawing the grid overlay shown in Figure 4.4.
        4.6.2.1. Constants:
            4.6.2.1.1. Parachute - T-10.
            4.6.2.1.2. Load Weight - 250 lbs.
            4.6.2.1.3. TTF - 51.6 secs.
            4.6.2.1.4. FTT - 3.2 secs.
            4.6.2.1.5. TAS - 130 knots.
        4.6.2.2. Cross Track Drift Offset - 132 yards.
                  4.54 = (132)
                  1.78 51.6
        4.6.2.3. Head/Tail Wind Distance - 154 yards.
                    5 = (154)
                  1.78   54.8
        4.6.2.4. Forward Travel Distance - 234 yards.
                  130 = (234)
                  1.78   3.2
     4.6.3. In-flight Use:
        4.6.3.1. The aircrew member will determine from all available sources the effective wind acting
        upon the parachutist/load from drop altitude to ground level. It will be necessary to convert this
        mean wind to drift and groundspeed values. The intersection of these two values is the CARP.
        4.6.3.2. The aircrew member should be aware that final wind drift values (as read from the grid
        overlay) will not necessarily represent the drift value used to determine the heading to fly at
        release. Also, the direct groundspeed readouts of navigation computer systems may not corre-
        spond to the values which affect the object dropped.
        4.6.3.3. One disadvantage of the grid overlay, when used alone, is the time required to convert the
        wind selected into drift and groundspeed values; however, it does interface with the close-in solu-
        tion of the CARP using direct navigation computer system readouts, especially in solving the tim-
        ing problem.
        4.6.3.4. Once the CARP is plotted, measure the distance from the timing line to the CARP and
        convert it to time (using formula H on the AF Form 4018) to determine timing point time.

4.7. Modified Grid Overlay Solution. The modified grid overlay combines the grid overlay with the
wind circle method. It allows the aircrew member to take into account the navigation system supplied
drift and groundspeed, as well as other wind information such as DZCT MEW, surface winds, etc., and
project them on the DZ depiction. A rapid determination of the CARP can be made from this graphic pre-
sentation, well within the one-minute advisor.
     4.7.1. Preflight:
        4.7.1.1. Select a properly scaled DZ chart, photo or drawing.
AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                                 29


       4.7.1.2. Compute a CARP using preflight wind information and the standard computer solution.
       4.7.1.3. Construct the grid overlay IAW paragraph 4.6.
       4.7.1.4. Draw the wind circle IAW paragraph 4.5. The wind circle is centered on the FTD plot
       used for the grid overlay.
NOTE: An option is to make the wind circle an ellipse. Based on the groundspeed increments at 6 and 12
o'clock and the wind circles at 3 and 9 o'clock. This method is the most accurate for drops with high for-
ward travel times
       4.7.1.5. Plot the preflight ballistic wind using preflight FTD.
       4.7.1.6. Convert the distance from the CARP to the timing point to time using preflight ground-
       speed. Enter this distance and time in the AF Form 4018, Items 33 and 34.
       4.7.1.7. The CARP may be plotted using one of three methods:
           4.7.1.7.1. Plot the drift effect from the FTD plot computed using preflight (110 knots) ground-
           speed (see (A), Figure 4.5.).
           4.7.1.7.2. Plot the ballistic wind azimuth (200o) and velocity (20 knots) on the wind circle
           (see (B), Figure 4.5.).
           4.7.1.7.3. Plot ballistic wind drift (- 6o) and the groundspeed (114 knots) values using the grid
           overlay (see (C), Figure 4.5.).
30                                                                           AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005


Figure 4.5. Modified GRID Overlay Sample.




NOTE: As indicated, these plots will not necessarily fall at the same point. The only time a common
CARP occurs is when a direct 25 knot head or tail wind is used.
         4.7.1.8. To reduce the clutter of the numerous lines drawn on the DZ depiction, it may be desir-
         able to omit the circles or to plot the Grid and circles in different colors. A quick method to plot
         wind direction and velocity is available by using the dividers to arc the distance/velocity measured
         on the run-in axis (the interval between grid overlay groundspeed lines equals five knots of veloc-
         ity) to the appropriate azimuth line. Omitting alternating grid overlay line will also reduce clutter,
         yet provide a usable solution to the wind plotting problem.
         4.7.1.9. See Figure 4.5. for a completed solution. Use the same data as paragraph 4.6.2.
     4.7.2. In-flight:
         4.7.2.1. Plot navigation system drift and groundspeed, surface winds, MEW, and any other avail-
         able wind information. Evaluate the winds to determine the CARP you plan to use.
AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                                31


       4.7.2.2. Compute timing point distance using the current or projected groundspeed.

4.8. Timing Graph Solution. The timing graph combines the wind circle and grid overlay methods with
a groundspeed-time graph. This provides the aircrew member a form upon which a PI-Timing point con-
figuration for any DZ may be constructed. The in-flight CARP can be plotted to allow the aircrew mem-
ber to extract a final timing point time quickly. The groundspeed-time graph (Figure 4.6., right hand side
of figure) may be duplicated to use in conjunction with a DZ chart/photo, provided it is constructed using
the same scale. This form may be best used for use with timing panels or lights. This does not restrict its
use when timing from any prominent surface feature.
   4.8.1. Preflight:
       4.8.1.1. Plot the point of impact the required number of yards away from the timing line. The line
       may be an extension of timing light/panels or a selected geographical timing point.
       4.8.1.2. Complete wind circle, grid overlay or modified grid IAW paragraphs 4.5.,4.6. or 4.7.
       4.8.1.3. Predominate DZ features may be annotated to aid line-up.
   4.8.2. In-flight:
       4.8.2.1. Timing point time may be obtained by plotting the drift effect from the point of impact,
       proceeding horizontally to groundspeed, then diagonally to timing point time. Subtract the for-
       ward travel time to obtain actual timing point time. The procedure is recommended since it mini-
       mizes the forward travel distance error induced by the difference in preflight and actual
       groundspeed.
       4.8.2.2. Plot the CARP based on FTD and drift effect, proceeding horizontally to groundspeed,
       then diagonally to timing point time in seconds.
NOTE: A negative number indicates a CARP prior to the timing line.
       4.8.2.3. The timing graph may be used to compute UDZL.
   4.8.3. Sample Problem:
       4.8.3.1. Given:
           4.8.3.1.1. FTT - 3.2 secs
           4.8.3.1.2. TAS - 130 knots
           4.8.3.1.3. GS - 110 knots
           4.8.3.1.4. W/V - 200o/20 kts
           4.8.3.1.5. Drift Effect - 580 yards
   4.8.4. The CARP is plotted from the forward travel distance plot and drift effect from the point of
   impact. The offset is the same for both methods, 370 yards left and 16.9 seconds is the resultant timing
   point timing. If the FTD is not plotted, a time of 20.1 seconds would be extracted from the chart.
   When the FTT of 3.2 seconds is subtracted, the resulting solution is the same 16.9 seconds as in the
   first method. The wind circle, grid overlay or modified grid from the point of impact or FTD plot was
   not shown to avoid confusion.
32                                                                           AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005


4.9. Other Timing Graphs. Timing graphs may be constructed to be used in conjunction with other
types of drops using a specific parachute. FTT is the governing factor. Figure 4.6. is an example for per-
sonnel (T-10 parachute) which incorporates FTT to provide the aircrew member a final timing point time
readout once drift effect is plotted.
     4.9.1. Construction.
        4.9.1.1. Refer to Figure 4.6.. A FTT of 3.2 seconds was used to determine the points in construct-
        ing the one second timing line. Use the formula:
                  GS (90 and 190) =    (Distance)
                       1.78         4.2(3.2 + 1 sec)
        4.9.1.2. Plot and join these distances (212 and 448 yards) on the graph. Repeat procedures for
        each additional second; i.e., 5.2, 6.2, etc., or find the yardage for a one second interval using the
        following formula, then plot succeeding lines:
                                          (Distance)
                  GS(90 and 190) = [51 and 107 yds]
                      1.78               1
        4.9.1.3. Plot distances as applicable to complete the GS/Time graph. Use the same procedure and
        applicable FTT when constructing a graph for other type parachutes.
     4.9.2. Preflight. Complete graph using the desired modified CARP solution. Insure the following
     rules are followed:
        4.9.2.1. Wind Circle - Must be centered on the PI.
        4.9.2.2. Grid Overlay - The preflight TAS line is plotted through the PI. Use the following for-
        mula instead of the formula in paragraph 4.4.1.3.; i.e., do not add FTT to TTF in that formula:
                    5 = (5 Knot Head/Tail Wind Distance)
                  1.78              TTF
     4.9.3. In-flight. The same data as in paragraph 4.8.3., above was used in this example. Plot drift effect,
     proceed vertically to the GS (at release) line, then diagonally to the final timing point time. This graph
     may be used to convert distance, timing point to the drift effect plot, from a separate DZ depiction pro-
     vided the same rules as in paragraph 4.9.2., above, are followed on the depiction. Distance may also
     be converted to time, using this graph, when used in conjunction with a grid overlay drawn on the DZ
     depiction. To do so, measure the distance from the CARP to the timing point, extract timing point time
     from the graph and add FTT.

       4.10.1.7. Groundspeed - 162 Knots
       4.10.1.8. FTT - 1.9 Seconds
       4.10.1.9. Usable DZ length - 1200 yards
       4.10.1.10. Determine altitude above the PI using AF Form 4018 block 14.
       4.10.1.11. Determine aircraft deck angle from appropriate weapon system technical order or air-
       craft instruction. For this example, assume two degrees.
       4.10.1.12. Determine timing point. For this example, assume the PI is the timing point.
       4.10.1.13. Use the formula - Sighting Distance = D = (TAN @) x (A/3)
                D = Distance measured directly below the flight deck at the moment the designated target
                       intersects an internal reference point.
                 @ = Angle of inclination from flight deck to designated target
                  A = Absolute altitude in feet AGL above the designated target
NOTE: Angle @, is measure using a clinometer or is specified through established techniques for each
aircraft (i.e., the technique for the C-141B is to use an angle of 75.5 degrees when the deck angle is zero
degrees and the top of the aircrew member’s head is against the center overhead panel and is sighting over
the Flight Command Repeater (FCR) box).
       4.10.1.14. Given a C-141B with a two degree deck angle and using the formula in paragraph
       4.10.4, we solve for the following: D = (TAN (75.5 +2)) x (650/3) = 977 yards.

   4.10.2. Plotting instructions for timing graph:
       4.10.2.1. The bottom line of the grid represents the timing reference point.
       4.10.2.2. Plot the sighting distance (D from paragraph 4.10.1.4.) along the DZ axis from the bot-
       tom of the graph in Figure 4.10. towards to the top of the graph.
       4.10.2.3. Draw wind circles (based on TTF and formula F on the AF Form 4018 in 10, 20, 30 and
       40 increments) from the point determined by paragraph 4.10.2.2. (Figure 4.11.)
       4.10.2.4. Plot the CARP based on the preflight winds (Figure 4.12.)
       4.10.2.5. Measure from the CARP to the right until it intersects with the preflight groundspeed.
       From this intersection, parallel the timing lines up and over to determine the graph time. For this
       example the time equals 9.0 seconds.
       4.10.2.6. Enter this value in the graph time block at the bottom of the form.
       4.10.2.7. Extract the FTT from the AF Form 4018, block 29, and enter it in the FTT block at the
       bottom the form.
       4.10.2.8. Subtract the FTT from the graph time to obtain a stop watch time.
       4.10.2.9. Extract the Usable DZ Time from the AF Form 4018, block 34, and enter it in the appro-
       priate block at the bottom of this form.
       4.10.2.10. Add the Stop Watch Time to the Usable DZ time to obtain a running Red Light Time
       measured from your timing point.
   4.10.3. Modifications to this technique includes the following:
       4.10.3.1. Delete the Usable DZ Time entry from the bottom of the chart and restart the timing for
       the designated red light time.
       4.10.3.2. Plot not only the wind but also the FTD on the wind circle.
NOTE: When using this option, remember not to subtract the FTT. The graph time automatically equals
the stop watch time.

                          HIGH ALTITUDE RELEASE POINT SOLUTIONS


5.1. General . The high altitude release point (HARP) solution is a basic CARP solution with the addi-
tion of a third (high-velocity, free fall) vector. High altitude-low opening (HALO) drops are primarily per-
sonnel drops, although CDS may be dropped using a timer or barometrically actuated second-stage
parachute release. The reverse side of the AF Form 4018, CARP Computation, or MAJCOM approved
software product, will be used to solve and record HARP data.
Exception: C-17 MC will compute HARP

5.2. Responsibilities:
     5.2.1. Compute a HARP for every high altitude airdrop. For multiple passes, recompute the HARP
     whenever drop altitude, actuation altitude, or significant wind changes occur.
     5.2.2. An experienced parachutist can maneuver approximately 500 feet horizontally for each 1000
     feet of free fall. In the event a parachutist cannot maneuver after exiting the aircraft (due to loss of
     visual ground references, injury, unconsciousness, or uncontrollable attitudes), or in the case of equip-
     ment delivery, an accurate HARP will ensure the load arrives in the vicinity of the intended point of
     impact. Additional modified HARP procedures are included in this chapter.
     5.2.3. Due to the altitudes involved in this type of airdrops, visual methods of directing the aircraft to
     the HARP are normally less accurate than other electronic methods. These methods include INS/
     SCNS, GPS, GRADS, radar and radar beacon. All of these systems still require use of HARP compu-
     tations, but they generally lead to better results. If the objective area or surrounding area is obscured,
     the airdrops when the ground is obscured there may be no way to steer toward the computed release
     point. Operational procedures and directives may require use of these systems for high altitude deliv-
     eries.

5.3. Equipment:
     5.3.1. HALO personnel. Personnel parachutes normally used are the MC1, the MC3 Para-Com-
     mander, the MT1X, and the MT1S Ram-Air. The standard United States Army free fall parachute
     assembly (Type AP 28S-3) consists of a main pack and canopy, reserve pack and canopy, and harness.
     An F-1B automatic ripcord release is incorporated into the assembly to automatically open the para-
     chute during preplanned jumping. This release allows automatic actuation down to an altitude of
     4,500 feet. When lower actuation is desired, a modified F-1B, designated the FF-1, can be used. The
     FF-1 release can be set for altitudes down to 3,000 feet. The barometric device activates an adjustable
     0-13 second timer which automatically pulls the ripcord. The FF-2 release is used with the MC3 para-
     chute. Any of these automatic systems can be used; however, manual ripcord actuation is normal pro-
     cedure.
     5.3.2. HALO CDS:
        5.3.2.1. Stabilized. Containers are rigged with a small stabilization parachute which, when
        inflated, is used to achieve a high velocity rate of fall, 200+ feet per second, to a selected altitude
AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                                   43


       where a barometric sensing device actuates a timing device and cutter to deploy a larger cargo
       parachute.
       5.3.2.2. Reefed or Confined Ballistic System (CBS). Containers are rigged with a 22 or 28 foot
       ring slot, G-12D or similar type cargo parachute which is reefed down to a specific diameter and
       equipped with one or more dereefing devices. The load descends with the chute in a reefed condi-
       tion at approximately 130 feet per second until a predetermined burn time has expired and actua-
       tion of the cutter system occurs. This system cuts the reefing lines, allowing the chute to inflate
       fully and slow the load descent to approximately 70 feet per second for the 22 or 28 foot ring slot
       and 26 feet per second for the 12 foot ring slot.
   5.3.3. High Velocity CDS. These loads are rigged with a ring slot parachute and descend at approxi-
   mately 65-100 feet per second. Loads normally consist of indestructible type supplies which can with-
   stand the high velocity impact. Normally, staging devices are not utilized.
   5.3.4. High Altitude Airdrop Resupply System (HAARS). The HAARS delivers containers from an
   aircraft flying at altitudes up to 25,000 feet. The containers can be dropped singly or in multiples to
   two. Up to 16 containers can be dropped from the C-130 aircraft and up to 40 from the C-141 . When
   the container leaves the aircraft, a modified 68 inch pilot chute opens and keeps the load upright while
   it falls at a terminal velocity of 250 feet per second. when the right altitude is reached, the sensor cuts
   a sheer web. This allows a cargo parachute to open and the load to land at an acceptable rate of speed.

5.4. Basic Assumptions. The deployment altitude obtained from the jumpmaster is considered to be the
altitude where full parachute deployment occurs and a constant rate of descent is established. Actuation
altitude (for manual ripcord pull) is normally considered to be 500 feet above the deployment altitude.
The aircrew member should confirm which altitude, deployment or actuation, corresponds to the altitude
figure received. When the FF-1, FB-1, or similar device is used for HALO CDS, actuation altitude is the
altitude at which the ripcord/cutter starts deployment of the second stage parachute.

5.5. Altitudes:
   5.5.1. Pressure altitude or indicated true altitude is used as the aircraft drop altitude reference. The
   drop altitude and actuation altitude must be converted to absolute altitudes for HARP computations.
   Indicated altitude is the altitude to be flown with an externally supplied (surface) DZ altimeter setting.
   Pressure altitude is the altitude to be flown with an altimeter setting of 29.92.
   5.5.2. The HALO parachutist can use any of three altimeter types to determine desired parachute
   actuation/deployment altitude:
       5.5.2.1. An adjustable pressure altimeter with a Kollsman window. This enables parachutists to
       manually activate their own parachute, based on indicated true altitude or indicated pressure alti-
       tude.
       5.5.2.2. An adjustable pressure altimeter without Kollsman window. The parachutist will usually
       adjust this type of altimeter so that it displays altitudes with respect to point of impact elevation.
       This enables parachutist to normally activate their own parachute, based on indicated altitude
       above ground level. This is the most common method used by US Army personnel.
       5.5.2.3. A non-adjustable pressure altimeter (29.92 in Hg/1013.2 Mb). This enables parachutists
       to manually activate their own parachute, based on indicated pressure altitude.

5.6. Wind Determination:
     5.6.1. There are two winds used in HARP computations:
        5.6.1.1. Ballistic Wind. The vectorial average of the winds from drop altitude to actuation altitude
        or ground level when single stage drops are made.
        5.6.1.2. Deployed Wind. The vectorial average of the winds from actuation altitude to the ground.
     5.6.2. Normally, the weather forecaster is not trained to calculate the vectorial average of winds;
     therefore, the aircrew member should request winds at the required altitudes and compute the average.
     Ballistic winds are computed using winds for every 2,000 feet from drop altitude down; deployed
     winds are computed using winds for ever 1,000 feet or less from actuation altitude down to the sur-
     face.

     altitude to obtain pressure altitude. The PAV is added when the altimeter setting is less than 29.92
     (compute using formula A).

5.8. Personnel HARP Computations. To compute a personnel HARP, only the following blocks of the
AF For 4015 need be filled in 13-15, 24-28, 31-33, 36-41, 43-57, 60-61.

5.9. HARP Computation Using the Formula D=KAV:
     5.9.1. The formula D=KAV is an accurate approximation of drift effect where:
           D = drift effect in meters
           K = ballistic wind constant (free fall= 3
                deployed = 25)
           A = altitude in thousands of feet
           V = average wind velocity
     The D=KAV method can be used to compute personnel HALO release points when MC-1, MC-3 or
     similar type, parachutes are used. When this computation method is used, the following documenta-
     tion is required on the AF Form 4015.

     5.9.2. The HARP computation is divided into three components:
        5.9.2.1. Deployed Drift Effect (DDE) is determined by computing the average wind velocity and
        direction from activation altitude to the ground and using the following formula:
        DDE = 25 x Altitude in thousands of feet x average wind velocity
        Example:


4000 ft winds        190/15
3000 ft winds        220/14
2000 ft winds        205/11
1000 ft winds        220/ 9
TOTALS               835/49

Average wind direction   835/4 = 209
Average wind velocity    211/4 = 12 kts
DDE = 25 x 4 x 12 = 1200 meters
       5.9.2.2. High Velocity Drift Effect (HVDE) is determined by computing the average wind veloc-
       ity and direction from exit to opening altitude and using the following formula:
       HVDE = 3 x Altitude in thousands of feet x average wind velocity
       Example:
       20,000 ft winds   160/85
       18,000 ft winds   160/75
       16,000 ft winds   165/75
       14,000 ft winds 165/65
       12,000 ft winds 155/50
       10,000 ft winds 150/45
       8,000 ft winds    185/20
       6,000 ft winds    190/20
       4,000 ft winds    190/15
       TOTALS            1520/450
Average wind direction 1520/9 = 169

5.12. Modified High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) General. The square ram-air parachutes
HAHO jumpers use have considerable maneuverability and forward speed. The ram-air parachute design
is an air inflated airfoil allowing it to glide in a controlled direction. The jumper operates hand controls
that allow turns and attitude changes. Square parachutes have approximately a 8:1 glide ratio; even in still
air, these parachutes can travel at a forward speed of 20.8 knots. Three square parachutes are currently in
use. The MT1-X is a 7 cell, 370 ft2 canopy with a maximum suspended weight of 450 lbs. It has the slow-
est descent rate and the highest glide ratio. For this reason, it is normally selected as the main canopy. The
MT1-S is slightly smaller (5 cell, 280 ft2 and a maximum suspended weight of 350 lbs) than the MT1-X
and is normally used as the reserve parachute. The MT1 is the smallest chute (7 cell, 270 ft2 and a maxi-
mum suspended weight of 350 lbs) and has the highest rate of descent. The total time of fall determines
how far a parachutist can travel, consequently, the higher the drop absolute altitude, the greater the dis-
tance the jumper(s) can travel.
     5.12.1. Release Point Considerations. The parachute drive distance is computed at 20.8 knots. In a no
     wind condition, the drop could be made anywhere inside an imaginary circle with radius equal to the
     drive distance, and centered on the intended point of impact, Figure 5.4. However, wind adds drift
     distance upwind of the PI, so the drop circle is shifted upwind the distance of the wind drift, figure
     5.4b. The PI will be inside the circle unless the average wind speed exceeds the parachute's forward
     drive velocity of 20.8 knots. On a drop outside of the circle, the parachute drive will not overcome the
     wind drift, so the jumper cannot reach the PI.
     5.12.2. There are two methods of computing a HAHO solution. The first is as follows:
        5.12.2.1. The acceptable release area is a circle within which it is possible for the jumper to exit
        the aircraft and reach the objective area. In a no-wind situation, this area will be centered on the
        end of the forward travel vector and will have a radius equal to the no-wind parachute glide dis-
        tance. In a wind condition, two separate computations must be performed. First, compute a
        no-wind glide distance using “X” in the formula below. Then make another computation using
        “V” in the same formula. This gives the required distance to move the center of the acceptable
        release area UPWIND from the PI. A no-wind acceptable release area will be precomputed for
        each planned drop altitude and will be recomputed for any change in drop altitude. A maximum
        glide distance will be computed for each drop and will be expressed in nautical miles upwind
        along the average ballistic wind vector.
        5.12.2.2. Use the following formula and contents to compute the HAHO acceptable release area:
        (A-2)(V or X)/K = Maximum glide distance in nautical miles
        A = AGL drop altitude in thousands of feet (item 7 of AF Form 4015).
        V = Wind speed in knots
        X = Parachute forward speed (20.8)
        K = 48 for MT1X parachutes
             60 for MT1S parachutes
             66 for MT1 parachutes
        Wind drift distance = (A-2)(V/K)
        Acceptable release area radius = (A-2)(X/K)
AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                               57


       (X/K) = .43333 for MT1X parachute
             = .34666 for MT1S parachute
             = .31515 for MT1 parachute
       5.12.2.3. Use a standard 300 meter forward travel vector.
   5.12.3. The second HAHO solution method is as follows:
            D = (A - SF) x(20.8 + V)
                     K x 1000
   D = Total Drive Distance in nautical miles
   A = Absolute Altitude in feet
   SF = Safety Factor in feet (A safety buffer from exit to assembly of parachutists under canopy and for
   assembly at a certain altitude once the "flight" arrives over the drop zone, normally 2,000; 1,000 feet
   for assembly and 1,000 feet for approach).
   20.8 = A Constant for parachute forward velocity
   V = Average Wind Velocity in knots
   K = Parachute Glide Constant:
          = 48 (MT1-X)
          = 60 (MT1-S)
          = 66 (MT1)
NOTE: The aircrew member must calculate for the lowest performance parachute. If the jumpers are
using MT1-X main canopies, but MT1-S reserves, calculate total drive distance using the lower perfor-
mance (higher K factor) parachute glide constant (i.e., use K = 60 in the above example).

      5.12.3.1. Required Radial HAHO Computations. Tactics may dictate that drops cannot be made
      on the upwind line. In a situation where the release location is determined by a restricted area, bor-
      der, or threat ring, plan to drop on a "required radial," figure 5.4c. Pick a radial or sector centered
      on the point of impact and passing through the allowed area for release. Plot area on a 1:250,000
      scale chart or larger. Solve the wind drift vector (in nautical miles) using the formula:
      D = (A - SF) X (V)
            K x 1000
AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                                59


       Plot the wind drift vector on the chart upwind of the point of impact. Next, solve the drive dis-
       tance (in nautical miles):
       D = (A - SF) X (20.8)
             K x 1000
       Use the drive distance as a radius and plot from the end of the wind line. If the circle crosses the
       required radial or sector in an area where the drop can be done, then you have an acceptable solu-
       tion.
       5.12.3.2. Plotting Instructions:
          5.12.3.2.1. Select a properly scaled chart (1:250,000 scale or larger scale is recommended).
          5.12.3.2.2. Plot the total drive distance upwind of the PI using the averaged wind vector. If
          there is a significant change in wind direction (i.e., a wind shear), it may be necessary to com-
          pute the drive distance as two rather than one vector. Should this occur, inform the jumpmaster
          of where the shear occurs and the desired dogleg headings to optimize drive distance.
NOTE: The aircrew member must examine the parachutists' descent profile in relation to surrounding
terrain, if intervening terrain exists, an alternate approach to the drop zone may be required.
          5.12.3.2.3. Move the plot the computed FTD in the reciprocal direction of the run-in course to
          compensate for forward throw. This is the release point.
   5.12.4. In-flight AF Form 4015 Completion Requirements. Use the AF Form 4015, High Altitude
   Release Point Computations, to solve and record in-flight personnel HARP data. Obtain and record
   actual in-flight winds, if different from preflight, the ballistic winds (averages) used to compute the
   HARP, and the groundspeed and drift at drop altitude.

       5.12.5.2. Solution. The modified HARP solution is completed on AF Form 4015 using the fol-
       lowing procedures, refer to Figure 5.2., column 1. Items are self-explanatory except as outlined
       below:
           5.12.5.2.1. Enter the desired drop altitude Item 1, Item 3, or Item 7, as appropriate. Work for-
           ward or backward to determine altitude to be flown. Enter 20,000 feet in Item 7 in the above
           example.
           5.12.5.2.2. Item 9. Subtract safety factor Item 8 from Item 7.
           5.12.5.2.3. Item 10. Enter the appropriate "K" Factor for the most restrictive parachute used.
           Since the parachutists are using MT1-S reserves, base "K" Factor on this parachute (i.e., K =
           60).
           5.12.5.2.4. Record preflight winds in the wind data block on the form.
           5.12.5.2.5. Item 11. Enter average of preflight winds. Do not include winds at drop altitude or
           surface winds in the average, since the first 1,000 feet is normally used for assembly, and the
           last 1,000 feet is used for approach.
           5.12.5.2.6. Item 12. Compute the total drive distance in nautical miles. This block may be split
           to accommodate an additional team safety factor (i.e., a percentage of the total drive distance).
           When a safety factor is used, indicate total drive distance, safety factor (percentage) used, and
           revised drive distance.
WARNING: For HAHO operations, this puts the parachutists at their maximum theoretical drive dis-
tance. In the interest of safety, a percentage (e.g., 80%) of the total computed drive distance may be used.
When a percentage safety factor is used, split item 12 indicating; the total drive distance, percentage of
total drive distance used, and its corresponding value.

           ground the parachutist desires to be overhead the DZ in order to maneuver for approach. No
           entry required for MC-1/3 HALO operations.
           5.12.5.2.9. Item 15. Deployed Drift Distance (HALO) - The altitude, in feet, the parachutist
           falls from actuation of recovery parachute and ground level (Item 13 minus Item 14).

WARNING: This puts the parachutists at their maximum theoretical drive distance. In the interest of
safety, a percentage (e.g., 80%) of the total computed drive distance may be used. When a percentage
safety factor is used, split item 18 indicating; the total drive distance, percentage of total drive distance
used, and its corresponding value.

           12.15), Deceleration Time (DT, figure 12.15), Deceleration Distance (DD, figure 12.15), Ver-
           tical Distance (VD, figure 12.15), Time of Fall Constant (TFC, figure 12.15), and Forward
           Travel Time (the sum of ET and DQ, both from 12.15). All other items SCNS requires to com-
           pute its HARP solution can be found on the AF Form 4017.

5.13. Modified High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) General. Modified High Altitude Low Opening
(HALO) personnel airdrops are similar to a basic CARP solution with an additional free fall/high velocity
vector. The MT1 Ram-Air and MC-1/3 paracommander parachutes are normally used. When the Ram-Air
parachutes are used, a combination of HAHO and HALO solutions are used in computing the HARP.
When the MC-1/3 paracommanders are used, the standard D = KAV/1000 formula may be applied to
compute the high velocity and deployed vectors to solve the HARP.
     5.13.1. Release Point Considerations. Regardless of the type of parachute used, the high velocity/free
     fall drift vector is computed using D = KAV/1000, where K equals a ballistic constant equal to three.
     The ram-air parachute drive distance is computed as in a HAHO solution using the actuation altitude
     minus the desired approach altitude. This is an accurate approximation of drift/drive the parachute is
     capable of in determining the HARP. The same wind velocity considerations discussed in paragraph
     5.12.1. apply. The MC-1/3 paracommanders are round steerable parachutes with limited maneuvering
     capability. Since these parachutes lack the performance of the ram-air parachutes, the computed drift/
     drive under canopy is considerably less. Compute the deployed drift using D = KAV/1000, with K =
     25, and A equal to the actuation altitude, in feet, above ground level. When using the D = KAV
     method, the forward travel vector must be applied to the equation to determine the HARP.
     5.13.2. HALO Computations:
        5.13.2.1. The formula D = KAV/1000 is an accurate approximation of drift effect where:
        D = drift effect in meters
        K = a ballistic constant
        A = altitude in feet
        V = average wind velocity
WARNING: The forward travel vector must be applied to the D = KAV equation to accurately determine
the HARP.
WARNING: The D = KAV/1000 method can be used to compute personnel HALO release points when
MC1-1 and MC1-3 parachutes are used. Use the AF Form 4015 to compute and record HARP computa-
tion data. When the MT1-X, MT1-S, or MT1 ram-air parachutes are used, a modification of the HAHO
formula can be used to calculate the deployed drift/drive, see paragraph 5.3.2.3. Method used will be
determined between the aircrew member and the jumpmaster prior to takeoff.
        5.13.2.2. MC-1/3 parachutes:
            5.13.2.2.1. The HARP computation is divided into three components:
                5.13.2.2.1.1. .High velocity drift effect (HVDE). Determined by computing the average
                wind velocity and direction from exit to opening altitude and using the formula D = KAV/
                1000, where K = 3.
                5.13.2.2.1.2. Deployed drift effect (DDE). Determined by computing the average wind
                velocity and direction from activation altitude to the ground and using the formula D =
                KAV/1000, where K = 25.
                5.13.2.2.1.3. Forward travel distance (FTD). Computed using Item 25, 26 and formula C
                on the AF Form 4015.
        5.13.2.3. Ram-Air Parachutes:
AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                               63


          5.13.2.3.1. The HARP computation is divided into three components:
              5.13.2.3.1.1. The high velocity/free fall vector is computed as in paragraph 5.13.2.2.1.1.
              and the formula D = KAV/1000 as described above.
              5.13.2.3.1.2. Deployed drift effect is computed using the HAHO formula:
              D = (A - SF) x (20.8 + V)
                       K x 1000
              D = Drive distance in nm
              A = Actuation altitude, in feet, above ground level
              SF = Safety Factor, in feet (a safety buffer to enable the parachutist to maneuver for DZ
              approach and landing).
              20.8 = A constant for parachute forward velocity
              V = Average wind velocity in knots
              K = Parachute glide constant:
                   = 48 (MT1-X)
                   = 60 (MT1-S)
                   = 66 (MT1)
              Since this equation yields a result in NM, it may be desirable to convert this to meters for
              ease of plotting (1nm = 1852 meters).
NOTE: The aircrew member must calculate for the lowest performance parachute. If the jumpers are
using MT1-X main canopies, but MT1-S reserves, calculate total drive distance using the lower perfor-
mance (higher K factor) parachute glide constant (i.e., use K = 60 in the above example).
              5.13.2.3.1.3. Forward travel distance (FTD). Computed using Item 25, 26, and formula C
              on the AF Form 4015.
   5.13.3. Plotting Instructions:
       5.13.3.1. Select a properly scaled chart (1:50,000 scale or larger scale is recommended).
       5.13.3.2. Plot the total DDE upwind of the PI using the averaged deployed wind vector.

       5.13.3.4. Move the plot the computed FTD in the reciprocal direction of the run-in course to com-
       pensate for forward throw. This is the release point.
   5.13.4. Inflight AF Form 4015 Completion Requirements. Use the AF Form 4015, High Altitude
   Release Point Considerations, to solve and record in-flight personnel HARP data. Obtain and record
   actual in-flight winds, the ballistic winds (averages) used to compute the HARP, and the groundspeed
   and drift at drop altitude.

   both the ram-air, and paracommander parachutes.

           and its corresponding value.

5.14. Modified High Altitude CDS, General. High altitude container delivery system airdrops may be
conducted as single or two-stage deliveries. A single stage delivery consists of load rigged with a stabiliz-
ing, high velocity or reefed parachute that allows the load to descend at approximately 65-250 feet per
second. A high velocity CDS, or BLU-82 are examples of single stage airdrops. A two-stage delivery con-
sists of a load rigged with a stabilizing, or reefed parachute allowing the load to descend at approximately
65-250 feet per second to a selected altitude. Once this altitude is reached, a barometric sensing device
actuates a timing device or cutter to deploy a larger cargo parachute, or dereef the partially inflated cargo
parachute. The confined ballistic system (CBS) and high altitude airdrop resupply system (HAARS) use
two-stage recoveries.
     5.14.1. High Altitude CDS Computations. The basic high altitude CDS HARP solution is completed
     on the AF Form 4018, Computed Air Release Point Computations. Computations require a DR
     computer and an appropriate scale chart or graph paper.

6.1. Ground Radar Aerial Delivery System (GRADS) , General. GRADS was developed to provide
an all weather system for aerial delivery using a ground radar to position the aircraft at an air release point.
This system is currently not in use. However, this paragraph will serve as an historic document for future
operational use. Two radar systems are available for positioning, the SEEK POINT (TBP-1) and the SKY
SPOT (MSQ-77 or equivalent). The SKY SPOT is the radar system used during RBS-directed airdrops.
     6.1.1. GRADS Terms:
        6.1.1.1. Acquisition Point. A preplanned point at which the ground based radar will acquire the
        aircraft and commence guidance.
        6.1.1.2. Miss Distance. The lateral distance from the planned CARP or HARP to the aircraft's
        actual position at release, as measured by the ground radar providing guidance.
     6.1.2. GRADS Procedures:
        6.1.2.1. Complete the applicable CARP or HARP computations. When plotting FTD and drift
        effect on a graph or a DZ depiction with a meter scale, it may be desirable to convert these values,
        in yards, to meters by using the formula:
                 .914 = (meters)
                  1.0    yards
        6.1.2.2. Plot the CARP or HARP and determine its position in terms used by the radar controller.
        See Figure 6.1.
           6.1.2.2.1. SEEK POINT: The aircraft position will be expressed in distance north or south and
           distance east or west from the PI. Insure the position is based on true cardinal directions. Since
           the winds and course used on the AF Form 4018 are magnetic, draw a magnetic north line on
           the depiction for use in plotting wind vectors and the DZ axis.
           6.1.2.2.2. SKY SPOT: The aircraft position will be expressed as true bearing and distance to
           the PI.
        6.1.2.3. The selection of the type DZ depiction is left up to the navigator and may be based on
        availability of map, photo, etc., coverage. Graph paper is acceptable, especially for IMC or night
        drops when ground features are obscured or unavailable and when aircraft altitude limits their use-
        fulness.
     6.1.3. Sample Problem:
           DZ Axis = 360o Mag or 010o True
           Drop Wind Direction = 044o Mag
           Drift Effect =300 yds(274 meters)
           FTD = 212 yds (194 meters)
AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                             71


   The CARP for the SEEK POINT controller would be relayed as 34 meters south, 191 meters east.
   The same CARP will be relayed to a SKY SPOT controller as 100o at 627 feet. Specific terminology
   will be IAW operational procedures.

6.2. Radar Beacon Delivery Procedures, General. Radar I, J and K-Band transponder beacons provide
a positive means to locate, recognize and align on the DZ, LZ, or RZ. Airborne radar approaches and air-
drops can be accomplished successfully by using the beacon as a terminal reference. Note: C-17s, see
T.O. 1C-17A-1-2 for Radar Beacon Delivery Procedures.
   6.2.1. Beacons are omni-directional or directional, depending on beacon and mode selected. Normal
   aircrew procedures for airdrop and airland are not affected by the use of radar beacons as a terminal
   reference.
   6.2.2. Equipment:
72                                                                          AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005


        6.2.2.1. The SST-181X (UPN-25) radar beacon transponder is a line-of-sight receiver and pulse
        transmitter operating in the I-Band frequency range. The radar beacon provides identification by
        either a coded pair of output pulses or a single pulse. The double pulse can be coded with distances
        between pulses from 4 to 12 nm. This provides 10 different combinations which the reception
        committee can set to control the pulse coding that appears on the aircraft radar. When double pulse
        is used, the innermost radar return is used for range and bearing determination. The outermost
        return is for authentication.
        6.2.2.2. The GAR/I radar beacon transponder is a line-of-sight receiver and pulse transmitter
        operating in the I, and K-Band frequency ranges. A Ka-Band signal triggers the transmitter which
        responds with a series of I-Band pulses. The first pulse provides range and bearing, the subsequent
        pulses (up to four) are for authentication. The transponder is set for horizontal and linear polariza-
        tion and has an antenna pattern of 25 degrees azimuth and 50 degrees elevation either side of cen-
        terline. Effective range is 20 nm under optimum conditions.
        6.2.2.3. The PPN-19 radar beacon transponder is a line-of-sight receiver and pulse transmitter
        operating in the I, K, or J-Band frequency ranges. The PPN-19 can provide omni-directional or
        directional radiation capability. There are seven operator selectable codes, and four selectable
        transmit modes. The PPN-19 can receive and transmit in I-Band, J-Band, I and J-Bands simulta-
        neously, or receive K-band and transmit in I-Band (GAR/I). The first pulse provides range and
        bearing, with subsequent pulses provided for authentication.
     6.2.3. Problems and Solutions:
        6.2.3.1. Scope ringing should be anticipated at close range to the SST-181X (UPN-25) beacon.
        This phenomenon is caused by the increased energy received from the beacon at close range.
        Scope ringing can be minimized by reducing radar gain and adjusting antenna tilt. Ringing is
        dependent upon a multitude of factors; however, as a general rule of thumb, ringing can be
        expected at the following ranges for the selected altitudes:


                  ALT (AGL)           RANGE
                  1,500 feet          1.5 nm
                  1,200 feet          1.0 nm
                  1,000 feet          0.8 nm
                  500 feet            0.6 nm
                  300 feet            0.5 nm
                  150 feet            0.1 nm

        Anticipation of scope ringing is important for two reasons. First, it is necessary to be established
        on the final drift corrected heading prior to scope ringing. Second, release timing for airdrops
        must begin before the radar pulse is obscured by ringing. Therefore, timing for release should
        begin, or the final update for AUTOCARP should be inserted, before the beacon return starts to
        ring. Timing should be initiated or restarted at the nearest forward range to improve accuracy.
        6.2.3.2. Slant range versus ground range needs to be clearly understood. Slant range is the
        straight line distance between the aircraft and target. Ground range is the distance from the point
        on the earth's surface directly below the aircraft to the target. The radar provides slant range.
AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                                  73


       Unfortunately, ground range is required for beacon computations. The slant range correction dis-
       tance for various altitudes and ranges is listed in Figure 6.2.
NOTE: Applies to slant-range radar displays only.
   6.2.4. Beacon Placement and Timing:
       6.2.4.1. Standard beacon placement procedures for the ground reception committee are in Joint
       Publication 3-05.1. The tactical environment will frequently require modification of these stan-
       dard placements. Ensure that both the ground reception committee and the aircrews are briefed
       where beacons are placed.
       6.2.4.2. Timing Point Timing. Because the possibility for scope ringing exists, timing point timing
       to the release point must be calculated for pessimistic and optimistic ranges (normally 2 and 1
       nm).
NOTE: The APQ-170 radar set (MC-130H) corrects the beacon return to ground range prior to display,
using standard beacon delay values (1.0 microseconds for I-band, 0.3 microseconds for J-band). There-
fore, no range correction is required unless a non-standard beacon delay is used.
       6.2.4.3. Sample Problem:
       Drop Alt = 1000 feet AGL
       Drop Groundspeed = 130 knots
          6.2.4.3.1. For 1 nm:            = 2025 yds      1832 yds @ 130 knots        = 25.1 secs
                     Beacon delay         = -166 yds      FTT                        = -3.2 secs
                     Slant Range Error = - 27 yds         Stopwatch timing            = 21.9 secs
                     Total                = 1832 yds
          6.2.4.3.2. For 2 nm:            = 4050 yds       3870 yds @ 130 knots       = 53.0 secs
                     Beacon Delay         = -166 yds       FTT                        = -3.2 secs
                     Slant Range Error = -14 yds           Stopwatch timing            = 49.8 secs
                     Total                = 3870 yds
          This solves for the range problem, if there is a considerable cross track offset, this distance can
          be computed and set using either the mechanical or electronic cursor to establish the proper
          inbound track. If, as in the above example, the CARP plotted 300 yds right of the beacon
          placement, the radar offset distance would be:
          Offset = 300 yds
          Slant Rng Corr for 300 yds @ 1000’ AGL= 170 yds
          Total (Required Scope Offset) = 470 yds

6.3. BLU-82B/C-130 Weapon System Delivery Procedures, General. The BLU-82B/C-130 weapon
system, nicknamed Commando Vault, is the high altitude delivery of a 15,000 pound general purpose
bomb from a C-130. This system depends upon the accurate positioning of the aircraft by either a fixed
ground radar or onboard navigation equipment. The ground radar controller or aircrew navigator as appli-
cable, is responsible for positioning the aircraft prior to final countdown and release. Primary aircrew con-
siderations include accurate ballistic and wind computations provided by the navigator, and precision
instrument flying with strict adherence to controller instructions. The minimum altitude for release due to
blast effects of the weapon is 6,000 feet AGL. A HARP will be completed by the aircrew for each drop
using the procedures in Chapter 5 and as outlined below.
   6.3.1. Computations:
       6.3.1.1. The AF Form 4018, Computed Air Release Point Computations, will be used to solve the
       HARP. Generally, the same procedures apply as for other single stage high velocity drops (refer to
       Chapter 5 for form completion requirements).
       6.3.1.2. The determination of a mean effective ballistic wind involves averaging of both azimuth
       and velocity at intermediate altitudes between drop altitude and the surface to determine the ballis-
       tic wind to be used in the release point computation.

6.4. C-130 Sight Angle Airdrop Technique. Sight angle dropping is based on a visual release using the
point of impact marking as the visual computed air release point. A basic understanding of the sight angle
dropping theory is necessary to grasp the concept of airdropping from different altitudes. These tech-
niques are provided as a basis to work from and do not preclude units from modifying or developing alter-
nate methods.
   6.4.1. The theory behind sight angle dropping is the geometrical triangle. The three sides of the trian-
   gle are the altitude above the point of impact, the release point distance short of the point of impact
   and the line of sight from the aircraft to the point of impact, Figure 6.3. The angle used to determine
   the release point is the angle formed by the sides "line of sight" and "altitude above PI", Figure 6.3.
   The "altitude above PI" is calculated by adding the drop altitude to the drop zone highest elevation
   minus the point of impact elevation, or by using the "altitude above point of impact" from Item 14 on
   the AF Form 4018. The "distance short of PI" is the airdrop forward travel distance corrected for the
   wind vector. Once the altitude above the PI and the distance short of the PI are determined, the sight
   angle may be calculated.
   6.4.2. Preflight:
       6.4.2.1. Compute the (CARP) on the AF Form 4018 as normal.
           6.4.2.1.1. Plot the location of the CARP relative to the PI on a blank sheet of paper (or graph
           paper if available) using any appropriate scale.
           6.4.2.1.2. Determine the distance (in yards) the CARP falls prior to, or after, the PI. This
           becomes the CARP distance or forward travel distance corrected for wind.
       6.4.2.2. Depression Angle Calculations Method One:
           6.4.2.2.1. Figure 6.4. gives the depression angle for a given forward travel distance and alti-
           tude above the point of impact. Enter the chart with both the distance above the PI and the for-
           ward travel distance corrected for wind. The resultant angle is the sight angle or depression
           angle for the airdrop.

NOTE: For CDS drops where the aircraft is normally flown with 7o nose up attitude, you must subtract
this deck angle from the angle extracted from Figure 6.4.
           6.4.2.2.2. Translate this angle to a visible reference in the cockpit. There are numerous ways
           to do this; marking the foot pedal windows with a grid to equate to yardage, using either a plot-
           ter or a clinometer to measure the angle and mark the reference point with a grease pencil or
           visual aid marker. The easiest method for measuring the angle in the cockpit is by using the
           plotter. All that is required is the plotter, string and a weight. Set up the plotter by threading the
           string through the center of the plotter and tie the weight to the string. The plotter is properly
           set up if when looking horizontally down the edge of the plotter, the weighted string measures
           90 degrees on the plotter compass and 0 degrees looking vertically at the ground.
       6.4.2.3. Depression Angle Calculations Method Two:
           6.4.2.3.1. At the aircraft, determine the airdrop sight angle using a simple ratio:
           eye altitude above the ground* =         pace distance
              planned airdrop altitude              CARP dist
NOTE: Eye altitude above the ground is the sum of the height of the aircraft floor and the navigator's
height in his airdrop crouch or whatever position he plans to release from. All C-130s are 7'11" from cock-
pit floor to tarmac. Example: With the navigator's head next to the corner of the flight engineer's overhead
panel, his eye is 5'7" from the floor. Therefore, use 13.5' as eye altitude above the ground.

          6.4.2.3.2. Compute and record the pace distance for personnel or equipment airdrops using the
          ratio described above.
NOTE: For CDS airdrops, a correction must be applied for the increased deck angle. For CDS airdrops
at 600 feet AGL, subtract 128 yards from the CARP distance plot and compute pace distance, as
described.
AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                                  79


        6.4.2.3.3. Starting at the aircraft forward jack stand location, measure the pace distance, deter-
        mined using the formula described above, and mark the position with a checklist, briefcase or
        whatever (either step it off or know the size of the ramp concrete squares). Repeat the proce-
        dure, pacing the same distance at an angle as shown in Figure 6.5.(the angle selected is not
        critical, but must be sufficient to account for any expected aircraft drift on approach to the
        DZ). The two markers can be referred to as “scaling markers.”
        6.4.2.3.4. With the two scaling markers in place, return to the aircraft cockpit. With your head
        in the same position from which the airdrop will be made (e.g., against the bend in the flight
        engineer's overhead panel), sight through the appropriate window to the first scaling marker.
        Place a grease pencil mark on the window at the intersection point. Repeat this for the other
        scaling marker. Connect the two window grease pencil marks with a line (note that the line
        slopes up somewhat from the nose of the aircraft to the aft). This is the "green light" line for
        that particular airdrop.
        6.4.2.3.5. To avoid having to scramble when in-flight conditions change the CARP location,
        one technique is to reaccomplish the appropriate steps for groundspeeds ten knots higher and
        lower than planned. Plot the 10 knot high and low "green light" adjustment lines above and
        below the preflight "green light" line. You may also consider repeating the above procedures
        for the left side of the cockpit as well.
     6.4.2.4. Inflight Actions. The navigator updates the CARP location and advises the pilot of the
     revised location. The pilot is responsible for maintaining the desired lateral displacement offset.
     The navigator makes minor corrections to his "green light" line and positions himself in the air-
     drop position on which the preflight was based. He watches the PI or timing point and call "green
     light" or starts his stopwatch timing when the point passes through the line.
     6.4.2.5. Error Sensitivity. Accurately positioning the aircraft at the release point is the most criti-
     cal phase of the airdrop mission. Sight angle airdrop methods reduce the possibility of gross air-
     drop errors; however, the sight angle method is only as accurate as the geometry used. Examples
     of error and resultant effect on aircraft positioning relative to the PI include:
        6.4.2.5.1. Head Positioning. If the eye is one inch from its intended position, the resultant
        sight angle error is (in yards):

6.5. Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) Airdrop Techniques (MC-130).
     6.5.1. General. The FLIR may be used to determine the release point on blind or marked DZs as the
     primary airdrop method or as an alternative to a planned AUTOCARP. Improved accuracy on airdrops
     can be obtained by performing the line-up visually and accomplishing the release on the FLIR.
     6.5.2. Preflight Procedures. Complete the AF Form 4018 IAW Chapter 3. Plot the CARP. Convert
     the 10 second warning time to yards using formula H and enter the result at the bottom of the column,
     Figure 6.7. Plot the location of the 10 second warning on the DZ diagram, if able. Divide Items 31 and
     32 in two as shown in Figure 6.7. The top half of each item is used for the 10 second warning and the
     bottom half for the CARP. If these items are already in use for visual timing information, use an adja-
     cent column for the FLIR data. Using all available imagery and chart information and the criteria
     below, select FLIR targets for line-up and release and annotate on a DZ photo, mosaic, diagram, or
     run-in chart (JOG or larger scale preferred):
        6.5.2.1. Line-up Targets. The line-up targets chosen must be prominent enough to allow positive
        identification early enough to allow final line-up corrections to be made using the FLIR alone,
        making allowance for the limited field of view and the difficulty of judging aircraft track relative
        to the FLIR monitor presentation. The line-up targets may be beyond the PI, short of the PI, or the
        PI itself. If available, select two or more line-up targets so that the line-up may be judged by com-
        paring their relative positions. Additional targets between the IP and the DZ should also be
        selected as an aid in maintaining course centerline and acquiring the DZ.
AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                                 81


       6.5.2.2. Release Targets. The 10 second warning and release may be accomplished by one of three
       methods; depression angle (Figure 6.6.), azimuth (Figure 6.7.), or timing (Figure 6.8.). Different
       methods and targets may be required for the 10 second warning and the CARP, depending on the
       location of each. Depression angle is the primary method. The azimuth method is used to avoid the
       possibility of not reaching the calculated depression angle due to a line-up error when the 10 sec-
       ond warning location or the CARP is too close to the FLIR target. To determine which method to
       use, plot two lines from the FLIR target at 50 degrees either side of the DZ course (Figure 6.7.,
       and Figure 6.8.). Use the azimuth method to determine the 10 second warning or the CARP if
       either falls in the sectors abeam the target, otherwise use the depression angle method. The timing
       method is least preferred and should only be used when adequate targets are not available in the
       DZ area or when the depression angles for either the 10 second warning or the CARP are less than
       approximately 10 degrees. Because of the high groundspeed and low drop altitude (resulting in a
       low FLIR depression angle) used for HSLLADS, the timing method is best suited for determining
       the HSLLADS 10 second warning.
           6.5.2.2.1. Depression Angle Method. Select an easily identifiable target as close to DZ center-
           line as possible. Measure the direct distance, in yards, from the FLIR target to the 10 second
           warning location or the CARP and enter in Item 31. Using the corresponding distance in Item
           31, obtain the depression angle value of the warning or the CARP from Figure 6.4., subtract
           this value from 90 degrees, and enter the result in Item 32 as appropriate (Figure 6.6.).
           6.5.2.2.2. Azimuth Method. Enter "AZ" in Item 31, in the section (10 second warning or
           CARP) that the azimuth method is used for. Measure the relative bearing to the FLIR target at
           the 10 second warning or CARP location and enter along with the direction in Item 32 (Figure
           6.7.).
           6.5.2.2.3. Timing Method. Select an easily identifiable target between the 10 second warning
           location and not more than two minutes prior to the CARP. Calculate the distance in yards
           from abeam the target to the warning location or CARP and enter in Item 31. Convert this dis-
           tance to timing point time using formula H and enter in Item 32. If both the warning and the
           CARP will be determined using the timing method, omit the top half of Item 31 and compute
           the top half of Item 32 by subtracting 10 seconds from the bottom half of Item 32 (Figure
           6.8.).
   6.5.3. Inflight Procedures.
WARNING: The MC-130E FLIR turret is not stabilized for pitch, roll or drift. Elevation and azimuth
readings will be accurate only during straight and level flight. Track angle error must be applied to turret
azimuth when checking DZ alignment. If the aircraft pitch angle at release can be determined during mis-
sion planning, the aircraft pitch angle should be added algebraically to the planned depression angle.
Example: If aircraft pitch angle is 7 degrees nose up, and the depression angle from Figure 6.4. is 18
degrees, then the corrected depression angle is 25 degrees. After the slowdown or three minute warning,
the left navigator plots the CARP and 10 second warning location (if it falls on the DZ diagram) using the
best available wind information. The navigator acquires the line-up target(s) on FLIR and provides the
pilot with headings to the CARP.
       6.5.3.1. Depression Angle or Azimuth Method. The navigator obtains either the depression angle
       or relative bearing for the warning location and CARP and records these values on the AF Form
       4018. Using a grease pencil, the right navigator marks the face of the FLIR turret position indica-
82                                                                      AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005


      tor with depression angle and relative bearing for the warning and the CARP, acquires the release
      target on the FLIR, and maintains it in the center of the FLIR monitor. The navigator monitors the
      turret position indicators and calls the 10 second warning and the release when the indicators pass
      the respective elevation or azimuth marks (Figure 6.6. and Figure 6.7.).
      6.5.3.2. Timing Method. The navigator calculates the distance from abeam the target to the 10
      second warning location or CARP, recalculates the timing point time based on in-flight ground-
      speed, and records these values on the AF Form 4018. The right navigator acquires the target on
      the FLIR and maintains it in the center of the FLIR monitor. The navigator monitors the turret
      position indicator, begins timing abeam the timing target, and calls the 10 second warning and
      release based upon stopwatch timing.

     to keeping a survivor on the ground viable until a rescue can be effected. HC-130 aircrews maintain

   qualification to airdrop personnel and rescue equipment during peacetime and contingencies using a
   variety of available procedures, depending on the situation.
   6.6.2. HC-130 Airdrop Options.
       6.6.2.1. Threat Environment. During contingencies, avoiding/minimizing detection and time near
       the survivor location may be a mission requirement, depending on the location and intensity of the
       threat relative to the location of the survivor. In an environment where the threat is unknown or
       when it dictates that a single pass over the survivor is desirable to airdrop pararescue personnel
       (PJs) and/or equipment, Computed Air Release Point (CARP)/High Altitude Release Point
       (HARP) procedures will likely be employed
       6.6.2.2. Non-Threat/Threat-Suppressed. In situations where multiple passes over a survivor are
       acceptable, standard rescue airdrop procedures have historically proven to be an effective means
       to deploy PJs and/or rescue-related equipment to a survivor. A variety of patterns to deploy per-
       sonnel and/or deliver equipment to the survivor may be flown, depending on wind and sea condi-
       tions, terrain, weather, and load to be delivered.
   6.6.3. Equipment Delivery Parameters
   Rescue equipment may be deployed with MA-1/2 Kits, dropped as para-bundles, or dropped free-fall.
   Each of these will be discussed. Typical chute types, drop altitudes, and load weight capacities for this
   equipment are listed below.

          AGL.

          mum.

     6.6.4.2. Airspeeds. The aircraft will be maneuvered at 150 KIAS or below in a racetrack pattern
     (aircraft may be flown on autopilot). Deployment airspeed is 125 KIAS. Static line deployments at
     airspeeds above 130 KIAS are prohibited due to parachute limitations.
     6.6.4.3. Surface Wind Limits.
        6.6.4.3.1. Static Line - 13 knots for land, 22 knots for water, 17 knots for tree penetration
        jumps.
        6.6.4.3.2. HGRP - 17 knots for land, 25 knots for water, 22 knots for tree penetration jumps.
     6.6.4.4. Crew Duty Differences From C-130E/H Airdrop Mission.
        6.6.4.4.1. Spotting Device Requirements. Spotter chute/streamer deployments prior to
        PJ-directed airdrops are required. Spotting devices may be either chute or streamer. The spot-
        ter chute used by USAF pararescuemen is the standard J-1 (12 foot diameter) wind-drift deter-
        mination parachute. The spotter chute weight can be one provided by the PJ or a MK 6 MOD
        3 smoke. Streamers are 20 foot lengths of crepe paper weighted on one end with a 3/4 to 1
        ounce metal rod.
     6.6.4.5. Fixed Target Pattern.
     In most cases, PJs will deploy to a stationary (fixed) target. The normal flight pattern will be a
     racetrack pattern, with the final approach extending from the spotting device to the target. The pat-
     tern must be large enough to allow for heading corrections on final approach. Normally, the down-
     wind leg will not exceed one and a half minutes. The crosswind leg will be made as soon as
     possible after the spotting device or jumper clears the aircraft. It is important that the target area
     remains in sight at all times.
     6.6.4.6. Target is stationary.
     Pattern is aligned so that final course extends into the direction of the wind.

      6.6.7.1. Situation permitting, the aircrew will maintain visual or radio contact with the pararescue
      team and maintain surveillance of the area for possible hazards. Every effort will be expended to
      ensure that the pararescue team is covered by rescue aircraft until the party is assured of surface
      assistance. However, surface assistance for land operation is not required as long as sufficient sup-
      plies are available. Prior to departure of the aircraft from the area, resupply schedules, communi-
      cation schedules, supply requirements, and planned actions of the pararescue team will be
      established by the aircraft commander and PJ team leader.

                                LEAFLET RELEASE COMPUTATIONS


7.1. General. The airdrop of leaflets in support of psychological warfare operations (PSYOPS) requires
the solution of wind drift and dispersion problems measured in nautical miles rather than yards. These
solutions are based on average leaflet characteristics and fundamental dead reckoning principles, compli-
cated by the extremely long falling time from even relatively low drop altitudes. The following discussion
covers the procedures for computing the best track, altitude and release point for leaflet drops.

7.2. Mission Planning. Leaflet versus CARP Theory. Leaflets move horizontally with the air mass until
they reach ground level, offering little or no air resistance. Each type of leaflet has a characteristic rate of
fall that can be used along with the ballistic wind vector to determine the release point for a given target
center. Unlike parachute supported loads, however, leaflets have no forward travel vector. They do have
an additional ballistic, called the spread factor that determines the size of the leaflet pattern when it hits
the ground. This factor, combined with the size of the target and the wind speed, determines the drop alti-
tude for low altitude drops. The size and shape of the target, combined with the ballistic wind direction,
determines the release track of the aircraft. Leaflet operations are far more affected by in-flight conditions
than CARP aerial delivery, since the actual ballistic wind affects not only the release location, but the
inbound track, and for low altitude drops, the release altitude. Because of this, an accurate weather fore-
cast is the single most important requirement for a successful leaflet mission.
   7.2.1. Rate of Fall (V). Leaflets are affected by up-drafts and down-drafts after their release, but over-
   all they will fall at fairly constant rate of a few feet per second. The actual rate of descent (V) varies
   with altitude due to the change in air density, but for low altitude drops, the rate is essentially equal to
   the constant sea level rate of fall (Vo). Average wind speed and rate of fall can be used to calculate the
   horizontal drift distance for the leaflets from their release point until ground contact.
   7.2.2. Spread Factor (RtTo). If the air was stable and all leaflets fell at exactly the same rate, they
   would drift with the wind in a tightly packed group to land on one spot. Instead, there is a predictable
   variation in the descent rates of the individual leaflets. For a given size and weight leaflet, the coeffi-
   cient of variation, called RtTo or spread factor, is the ratio of the range of descent times for 90% of the
   leaflets to the average descent time. The larger this value, for a given drift distance, the more the leaf-
   lets will spread apart. In addition, the leaflets will spread a small amount, even in still air. The spread
   factor is independent of the total number of leaflets in the release, so that releasing a larger number of
   leaflets affects only the density of leaflets on the ground, and not the size of the ground pattern.
   7.2.3. Target Coverage Planning:
       7.2.3.1. Ground Pattern Size. The ground pattern from a single point release is elliptical in shape
       due to the variation in descent rates (Figure 7.1.). Drift distance is measured along the ballistic
       wind direction to the center of the major axis, which is also parallel to the ballistic wind. In addi-
       tion to the spread from still air dispersion, this axis is lengthened by a factor equal to RtTo times
       the drift distance. At low altitude, the length of the minor axis (width of the ground pattern) is due
       only to still air dispersion and is approximately equal to one-half the drop altitude - about 0.5 nm
       for a drop altitude of 6,000 feet. Because of the small size of the minor axis, a single point release
       will be adequate only for narrow targets such as lines of communication and coastlines.

       7.2.3.2. Multiple Release Planning. A continuous release hopper may be used if available, other-
       wise a series of bundles or delayed-opening packages may be dropped to cover the entire area. The
       area covered will always be a parallelogram, with two sides parallel to the ballistic wind direction
       and two parallel to the aircraft track, Figure 7.2. The mission planner must determine the opti-
       mum parallelogram to cover the target with a minimum of spillover. To determine the required
       ground pattern, start by drawing two lines parallel to the average wind direction at each end of the
       target, Figure 7.3.A. These form the extreme pattern start and end points. Pick the track axis by
       drawing two parallel lines to en-close the target area but as little of the outside area as possible,
       Figure 7.3.B. Finally, if excessive numbers of leaflets will be wasted in order to include a small
       portion of the target area, the mission planner may elect to reduce the size of the selected parallel-
       ogram to optimize expended leaflets, Figure 7.3.C. The distance along the track axis (from point
       A to B in Figure 7.3.C) is the target length, and is used to determine the number of releases. The
       distance along the wind axis (from point C to D) is the major axis length, and is used to determine
       the drop altitude.

   7.2.4. Low versus High Altitude Releases. High altitude leaflet drops permit a larger target area to be
   covered for a given number of leaflets. High level wind patterns, however, may place the release point
   inside denied airspace or expose the aircraft and crew to threats. A low altitude release may also be
   preferable if the target area is small, the number of leaflets is limited, or spillover into adjacent terri-
   tory must be avoided. In general, targets five miles in diameter or smaller are acceptable for low alti-
   tude drops.
94                                                                            AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005


7.3. Low Altitude Release Procedures (Method 1).
     7.3.1. Winds. For low altitude leaflet drops, the ballistic wind affects the inbound track and the release
     altitude, as well as the location of the release point. Also, in a threat area, a climb to check winds over
     the target may not be possible. Mid-altitude winds can be checked en route or during the climb to drop
     altitude. The computations shown below make it possible to update the release point using winds
     obtained in the climb, as long as the actual wind direction is fairly close to those used in preflight plan-
     ning. Changes in wind speed, but not direction, will affect the drop altitude more than the required off-
     set. These changes can be adjusted for after the climb to drop altitude has begun. Changes in the wind
     direction, on the other hand, are practically impossible to readjust close to the target area. This is
     because both the track axis and the required major axis length are changed, affecting the drop altitude
     and the offset distance. For these reasons, an accurate preflight wind is extremely important. After
     obtaining preflight winds, consider the effect of any terrain in the target area and up to five to ten miles
     upwind of the target.
     7.3.2. Wind Averaging (Figure 7.4.). Obtain forecast winds at the surface and at each 1,000 foot
     increment up to 4,000 feet above target elevation. Using the DR computer wind face or graph paper,
     determine the net wind direction and velocity from the surface to each 1,000 foot altitude up to 4,000
     feet.

   7.3.3. Instructions for Completing AF Form 4011, Low Altitude Leaflet Computations. The net
   wind velocities from the averaging example above are used in the following example. While wind
   direction is not used directly in the calculations, the net wind direction at 4,000 feet (107 degrees) is
   used to determine the required major axis length, Figure 7.2. and Figure 7.3.
       7.3.3.1. Enter the preflight data for the example shown below on AF Form 4011, Figure 7.5.
       Major axis of target (along net wind dir.): 3.0 nm
       Length of target (along desired track): 4.0 nm
       Leaflet type: 8.5" X 3.2" / 20# paper
       7.3.3.2. If the paper weight is unknown, follow the instructions in the NOTE at the end of Figure
       7.6. With the leaflet size and paper weight, enter the reverse side of AF Form 4011, Figure 7.6., to
       find the spread factor (RtTo) and ground rate of fall (Vo) (0.43 and 1.7 ft/sec in the example).
       Enter these values in block 11, and enter the spread factor in the "1 nm drift distance" block on the
       graph as well. This value corresponds to 1 nm of drift distance. Mark the horizontal scale with a
       tick mark at the value of RtTo. Use dividers (or multiply RtTo by 2, 3, 4, ...) to mark tick marks at
       equal intervals along the rest of the horizontal scale. Label mark in intervals of 1 nm drift distance,
       Figure 7.5.
       7.3.3.3. Calculate (RtTo)/Vo and enter the result in the "1 knot Wind Velocity" block on the graph
       (0.253 in the example). This value corresponds to 1 knot of wind velocity. As with the drift dis-
       tance, mark the vertical scale in intervals of 1 knot. Label the marks in intervals of 1 or 5 knots, as
       desired.
NOTE: Steps (1) and (2) above need not be repeated for each mission if the leaflet size and weight
remains unchanged. The graph with marked and labeled scales may be reproduced and reused.
       7.3.3.4. Mark the forecast surface wind on the vertical wind scale. Using the preflight net wind
       velocities calculated in paragraph (2) above, plot each net wind on each slanted altitude line, Fig-
       ure 7.5. If necessary, obtain wind forecasts for higher altitudes and calculate additional net winds
       to extend the wind line as close as possible to the right side of the chart.
       7.3.3.5. Mark a point (P on Figure 7.5.) at the intersection of the wind line and the curved vertical
       line corresponding to the required major axis, interpolating as necessary. Project from point P ver-
       tically down to find the required offset distance upwind from the target track axis (6.4 nm in the
       example). Interpolate point P between the slanted altitude lines to find the required drop altitude
       (3000 feet in the example). Enter the Drift Distance and Drop Altitude in blocks 1 and 16 respec-
       tively.

      procedures and tactical checklists.

7.4. Low Altitude Release Procedures (Method 2):
      7.4.1. Figure 7.7. to Figure 7.12. contain 19 descent rates (V0) that apply to many leaflets of various
      sizes and paper weights. Once the descent rate has been determined for a given leaflet, the drift dis-
      tance to the center of the leaflet pattern or mass can be determined. For example, when dropping at
      3000 feet the (V0) for the 6”x3” leaflet (20 lb) is 2.5' per second (see Figure 7.6.). For a 10 knot wind,
      reading across figure Figure 7.7. to the 2.5 feet per second column, we find the total drift to the center
      of impact is 3.8 nm.
      7.4.2. The length of the leaflet pattern or major axis can also be determined by multiplying the spread
      factor (RTOT0) found on the reverse side of AF Form 4011 (Figure 7.6.) by the total drift distance.
      For example, as determined above, center of mass for the 6”x3” leaflet in 20 lb. paper weight drifted
      3.8nm in a 10 knot wind. To find the major axis of the leaflet pattern, multiply the spread factor
      (RTT0) of 1.11 times the drift distance of 3.8 nm and the answer is 4.2 nm. To this add 1/2 of the
      release altitude which is 1500' or .25nm for a total major axis of 4.45 nm. The minor axis is then com-
      puted at 1/2 the release altitude. In this example the minor axis is .25 nm.
      7.4.3. If a last minute decision is made to fly at a lower altitude due to high winds or low hanging
      clouds, an adjustment can be made to account for the change. Using the above example, if the drop is
      made from 2,000 feet, the drift distance is then 2/3rds of the answer shown or if from 500 feet, 1/6th
      of the answer shown.
      7.4.4. The distance of ground elevation above sea level must also be taken into consideration. The
      data in figures Figure 7.7. to Figure 7.12. are from the specified altitude to sea level. As in the above
      example, if the target elevation is 500 feet, then the leaflet only falls 2500 feet or 5/6ths of the answer
      shown.

7.5. High Altitude Release Procedures. High altitude leaflet releases present unique problems to the
mission planner, since even a moderate change in wind direction or speed can cause the leaflet release
track to be displaced several miles. Depending on the characteristics of the leaflet, the average descent
time from 25,000 feet can be over five hours. Wind information, therefore, must take into account changes
expected in the lower altitude winds several hours after the planned release time. Missions may be tar-
geted for well defined urban/border areas, or for large expanses of sparsely populated rural territory. Cov-
erage of the required area is so dependent on the falling characteristics of the leaflet that the selection of
AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                                 107


size and paper weight should be confirmed only after study of the required flight profile, wind patterns,
and required target coverage has been made.
   7.5.1. Instructions for completing AF Form 4016, High Altitude Leaflet Computations (Figure
   7.13.):
       7.5.1.1. Enter the table on the back side of AF Form 4016 (Figure 7.6.) with the leaflet size and
       paper weight to find Vo and RtTo. Also note whether the leaflet is an autorotator or non-autorota-
       tor. Enter the results at the top of Section I of AF Form 4016.
       7.5.1.2. Obtain forecast winds in 5,000 foot intervals up to the highest anticipated drop altitude.
       Enter in the wind speed and direction columns of the AF Form 4016, Section I.
       7.5.1.3. .Enter the table on the back side of AF Form 4016 (Figure 7.14.) with the leaflet type
       (autorotator/non-autorotator) and ground rate of descent (Vo). Find the time factor in hours for
       each 5,000 foot altitude block and enter in Section I. If the average target elevation is above 1000
       feet MSL, multiply the time factor for the 0-5,000 foot block by the factor (5,000 - Target Elev)/
       5,000.
       7.5.1.4. For each 5,000 foot block, calculate the drift distance and enter in Section I. Starting with
       the lowest altitude block, plot the drift vectors (drift distance and wind direction) end to end on an
       appropriately scaled chart (1:1,000,000 scale or larger). Each vector is plotted into the wind direc-
       tion, and the first vector originates from the center of the target area, Figure 7.13.
       7.5.1.5. .Measure the distance and azimuth from the end of each vector to the target center and
       enter in Section II. Calculate the length of the major axis for each 5,000 foot drop altitude incre-
       ment on Section II as shown in Figure 7.13.
       7.5.1.6. On the chart, compare the required target area with the major axis length for each 5,000
       foot block to determine the required drop altitude. Note that the major axis is to be measured along
       the Measured Net Wind Direction for that drop altitude. Enter the selected drop altitude in Section
       III. If at maximum drop altitude the major axis is still too small, either:
           7.5.1.6.1. Select a new leaflet size or weight with a larger coefficient of variation or slower
           rate of fall.
           7.5.1.6.2. Reduce the required major axis by making two or more passes, Figure 7.16.
           7.5.1.6.3. Postpone the mission until stronger winds are forecast.
           7.5.1.6.4. Use a different drop platform with a higher altitude capability.
       7.5.1.7. Determine the desired release track(s). The release track start and end points (A and B in
       Figure 7.16.) are located at the drift distance (52.2 nm in Figure 7.13.) upwind along the drop alti-
       tude net wind direction from points a and b.

         7.5.1.8. Use Section III of AF Form 4016 to calculate the minor axis as follows:

      7.5.1.8.1. Divide the selected drop altitude by 12,152 to obtain the no-wind minor axis in nm
      (2.1 in Figure 7.13.).
      7.5.1.8.2. To adjust for minor axis spread caused by changing wind direction between surface
      and drop altitude, measure the maximum lateral distance the wind vectors deviate from the net
      (drop altitude) drift vector (1.8 nm in Figure 7.15.).
      7.5.1.8.3. Add the spread factor (Rt/To) to the sum of (a) and (b) to obtain the minor axis.
      7.5.1.8.4. Use the bottom section of AF Form 4016, High Altitude Leaflet Computations, to
      calculate and record the items in the Drop Information Summary for use in the mission and
      in-flight briefings.

7.6. Accuracy Limitations. The accuracy of the low altitude and high altitude leaflet computation meth-
ods are only as good as the wind data upon which they so heavily depend. If complete coverage of a
defined area is more critical than avoiding spillover, points A and B, in Figure 7.16., can be defined far-
ther apart to account for possible wind direction variation. The required major axis length can also be
expanded by 10% to allow for variation in wind speed. In addition to wind variations, other factors can
prevent the target audience from receiving the desired density of leaflets. Mountains will create a

"shadow" effect downwind, as leaflets land on their upwind side. High humidity during printing and pro-
cessing may cause leaflets to stick together or even freeze at high altitudes, causing them to fall nearly
straight down. The average rate of fall may vary significantly from the values shown in Table 1 for vari-
ous reasons. To allow for these variations, select leaflets with a relatively high spread factor so the proba-
bility of covering the target area will improve. Normally, the use of leaflets with spread factors less than
0.20 should be avoided.

CAUTION: Combination drops will use the higher drop altitude.
NOTE: Minimum drop altitudes for HE using the 5,000 pound parachute release is 1000 feet AGL, or by
parachute type, whichever is higher.
REMARK: A-22 containers with 26-foot ring slot chutes airdropped below 10,000 feet MSL during uni-
lateral training will be rigged with non-breakaway static lines, and those airdropped at 10,000 feet and
above will be rigged with breakaway static lines. EXCEPTION: A-22 containers with 26-foot ring slot
chutes airdropped below 5,000 feet AGL during unilateral training will be rigged with non-breakaway
static lines IAW T.O. 13C7-1-11.

8.4. C-141/C-17/C-5 Aerial Delivery Ballistics General. The following charts contain ballistic data for
a variety of load and parachute types in use by all four services. The data represents average information
derived from aerial delivery test run by the US Army Airborne Board, US Army Natick Laboratory, and
the US Air Force Mobility Center (USAFMOBCENT). Where exact data is not depicted, interpolate
between given values. For heavy equipment, the exit times given represent an average value based on the
load being rigged approximately two-thirds aft of the bulk head. Weight ranges depicted here do not
supersede technical orders or rigging manuals. All weights represent total rigged weights.
NOTE: The C-17 mission computer ballistic data will be used for airdrops. Data presented in this section
is for reference only. Exception: IMC and EMC data will be used until incorporated in the mission com-
puter.

NOTE: To obtain Forward Travel Distance (FTD), multiply applicable Exit Time by ground speed
(knots), divide by 1.78 (1.94 if using meters), and add to the horizontal distance of fall. For drop altitudes
above 600 feet AGL, subtract 40 yards (37 meters) from FTD.

9.1. C-130 Aerial Delivery Airspeeds. Aerial delivery airspeeds are a function of the force required to
inflate the parachute and the airdrop altitude to minimize damage to the airdropped object. For AFSOC
only, when the mission requires use of airspeeds other than those recommended, ensure airspeed falls
within the parachute airspeed range listed in Chapter 10. All crewmembers will be briefed on the drop
airspeed.

NOTE: Use 125 KIAS only for Pararescue deployment.
*Used when gross weight is above 120,000 pounds. For combination drops, use the higher airspeed
KIAS.

9.2. C-130 Aerial Delivery Altitudes. The altitudes listed in Table 9.2. are the minimum altitudes above
the highest point on the drop zone. Commanders may agree to higher altitudes. For formation drops, no
aircraft will drop at a lower altitude than a preceding aircraft in the formation. When load compatibility or
operational considerations permit, stack elements beginning with the lowest drop altitude. No aircraft will
drop lower than its computed drop altitude. For combination drops, the load requiring the highest drop
altitude determines the aircraft drop altitude. Airdrops at or above 3,000 feet AGL will be conducted with
high altitude parachutes, either high velocity ring slot or high altitude high/low opening (HAHO/HALO).
Minimum altitudes shown are intended to provide guidance and do not restrict the Army and Air Force
commanders in their planning of combat operations. Altitudes are based on the technical design character-
istics of the parachutes and represent the minimum at which the parachutes may be expected to perform
their intended function with acceptable reliability. Use of lower altitudes than shown may result in the

NOTES:
1.    If the following criteria are not met, the minimum altitude is 1,000 feet AGL: (1) Static lines are used. (2) Para-
      chutes are equipped with anti-inversion devices. (3) When using T-10 parachutes, use established exit control pro-
      cedures. (4) When using MC1-1A/B/C parachutes, use alternating door exit procedures (ADEPT). ADEPT does
      not apply to combat operations or special tactics personnel.
2.    Plan minimum IMC airdrops altitudes at 500 feet above the highest man-made obstacle or terrain feature and spot
      elevation, or 400 feet plus one contour interval above the highest depicted basic terrain contour, whichever is
      highest, within 3 NMs either side of the run-in centerline from DZ entry point to DZ exit point. Not applicable to
      aircraft with a fully operational terrain following system.
REMARK: A-22 containers with 26-foot ring slot chutes airdropped below 10,000 feet MSL during unilateral
training will be rigged with non-breakaway static lines, and those airdropped at 10,000 feet and above will be rigged
with breakaway static lines. EXCEPTION: A-22 containers with 26-foot ring slot chutes airdropped below 5,000 feet
AGL during unilateral training will be rigged with non-breakaway static lines IAW T.O. 13C7-1-11.

9.3. Aerial Delivery Wind Limitations. Aerial delivery wind limits and restrictions will be based on the
information contained in Table 9.3. and Table 9.4. When surface winds are known, airdrop decisions will
be based solely on surface wind limitations. When surface winds are unknown (e.g., blind drops to
unmanned DZs), the jumpmaster and army airborne mission commander (if designated) will be advised
when drop altitude winds exceed 30 knots for personnel drops. For blind equipment and bundle aerial
deliveries to unmanned DZs, the aircraft commander will make the decision to drop. For operational res-
cue missions, the decision to deploy the jumpers is determined by the jumpmaster and aircraft com-
mander.

9.4. Aerial Delivery Parachute Ballistics. The ballistics of different types of parachutes vary. Each
parachute is designed for a specific purpose and has its own peculiar characteristics. The data represents
average information derived from aerial delivery test run by the US Army Airborne board, US Army Nat-
ick Laboratory, and the US Air force Mobility Center (USAFMOBCENT). Where exact data is not
depicted, interpolate between given values. In all cases: Load Weight = Suspended Weight + Parachute
Weight. Aircrews will not make airdrops using parachutes for which this instruction does not list ballistics
unless the user provides approved ballistic data or "K" factor. The ballistics or "K" factor must be
approved by the above mentioned agencies or the MAJCOM. This does not apply to formal tests

NOTES:
  1. To obtain Forward Travel Distance, multiply applicable exit time by groundspeed/1.78 (1.94 for
     meters) and add to horizontal distance of fall table.
      2. For drop altitudes above 600 feet, subtract 40 yards from Forward Travel Distance.
      3. Values obtained are valid approximations only for roughly cube-shaped loads having a weight
         range between 160 and 3840 pounds and with weight/volume ratios between 20 and 60 pounds/
         cubic foot.

in flight by aircraft avionics. Automatic or manual steering indications are provided to guide the aircraft
to the release point.
Adverse Weather Aerial Delivery System (AWADS)—The precise delivery of personnel, equipment,
and supplies during adverse weather, using a self-contained aircraft instrumentation system without
artificial ground assistance, or the use of ground navigation aids.
Computed Air Release Point (CARP)—A computed air position where the first paratroop or cargo item
is released to land on a specified impact point.

Containerized Delivery System (CDS)—CDS is designed to airdrop numerous individual containers,
high velocity, low velocity, or HALO, and double containers at low velocity initiated primarily by gravity
extraction.
Circular Error Average (CEA)—A computation used to track training data for each airdrop qualified
crew member (primarily navigators). Compute CEAs by averaging all the drop scores (in yards) for each
category specified in paragraph 1.7.
Centerline Vertical Restraint (CVR)—An aircraft equipment add-on set of plates to the cargo
compartment floor that provides vertical restraint of CDS bundles prior to delivery.
Combination Drop—Combination drops are when jumpers exit from the aircraft immediately after the
extraction of airdropped equipment.
Container Release system (CRS)—The CRS is a modification of HSLLADS components without the
sling and is used for low speed gravity drops.
Cross Track Drift Offset—The distance, perpendicular to drop zone centerline, the aircraft tracks to
compensate for drift effect incurred during parachute descent.
Deceleration Distance (DD)—This factor is for high altitude-low opening (HALO) only. The vertical
distance, in feet, that the load descends from chute actuation to full canopy deployment.
Deceleration Time (DT) For HALO only—The vertical distance, in feet, that the load descends from
chute actuation to full canopy deployment.
Deceleration Quotient (DQ)—A constant in seconds computed during airdrop tests that compensates for
the nonlinear deceleration in forward speed of an airdropped load as it approaches stabilization. This
factor is computed by subtracting exit distance from forward travel distance and dividing the difference
by effective ground speed of the aircraft.
DQ = (FTD -ED) / EGS.
Drift Effect—Horizontal distance traveled downwind by a load under full canopy.
Drop Zone (DZ)—A specified area upon which airborne troops, equipment, or supplies are airdropped.
Drop Zone Controller (DZC)—An individual on the DZ required to monitor all airdrop operations.
Exception: Airdropping of unconventional warfare forces as defined by the Joint Strategic Capabilities
Plan (JSCP) Annex E, does not require a DZC. AFI 13-217 defines DZC qualification duties and
responsibilities.
Effective Ground Speed (EGS)—A factor used during testing to determine DQ. Computed by applying
the mean true wind between drop and stabilization altitude to the aircraft true airspeed (TAS) and true

Forward Travel Distance (FTD)—The ground distance traveled by the airdropped load from the green
light signal to stabilization. Plot FTD back from the point-of-impact (PI) along DZ axis.
Forward Travel Time (FTT)—Exit time plus deceleration quotient. A time constant that compensates
for the horizontal distance the object travels from the green light signal until reaching stabilization. This
factor is used to compute FTD.
Ground-to-Air Responder/Interrogator (GAR/I)—A beacon used to accomplish radar only airdrops
(MC-130 only).
Ground Marked Release System (GMRS)—A network of panels or lights marking the release point.
Reference AFI 13-217.
Ground Radar Aerial Delivery System (GRADS)—A method to position the aircraft for the airdrop
(usually at high altitude) by using a ground based radar.
High Altitude Airdrop Resupply System (HAARS)—CDS modified for airdrop from high altitude
with a sensor to deploy a cargo parachute when the right altitude is reached.
High Altitude High Opening (HAHO)—A high altitude airdrop in which parachutes deploy
immediately upon exit from the aircraft.
High Altitude Low Opening (HALO)—A high altitude airdrop in which a period of freefall precedes
actuation of the parachute(s). Does not include high altitude CDS using high velocity ring-slot parachutes
(Hi-V).
High Altitude Release Point (HARP)—HALO/HAHO only. A point in space, computed by any means,
over which the aircraft must be positioned at the time of release to ensure the load impacts the desired
point on the ground.
High Speed Low Level Aerial Delivery System (HSLLADS)—A sling airdrop system employed to
allow the aircraft to deliver loads from the aft cargo door and ramp at speeds up to 250 KIAS and at
minimum altitudes (MC-130).
High Velocity Rate of Fall/Free Fall Rate of Fall—This factor is the rate of fall in feet per second
derived from parachute ballistic data, corrected for sea level standard day.
Initial Point (IP)—1. The first point at which a moving target is located on a plotting board. 2 A
well-defined point, easily distinguishable visually and/or electronically, used as a starting point for the
bomb run to the target. 3. Airborne—An air control point close to the landing area where serials (troop
carrier air formations) make final alterations in course to pass over individual drop or landing zones. 4.
Helicopter—An air control point in the vicinity of the landing zone from which individual flights of
helicopters are directed to their prescribed landing sites. 5. Any designated place at which a column or
element thereof is formed by the successive arrival of its various subdivisions, and comes under the
control of the commander ordering the move. (Joint Publication 1-02).
Military Free Fall (MFF)—MFF is an employment concept encompassing both HALO and HAHO
techniques of parachuting.
AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                                 157


Mean Effective Wind (MEW)—An average wind direction and speed measured from the DZ surface to
drop altitude as calculated by the DZC.
Parachute Deployment—The stage in the airdrop process when a parachute has achieved its full opening
potential.
Point of Impact (PI)—The specified location on the drop zone where the first object to exit the aircraft is
expected to land.
Psychological Operations (PSYOPS)—Planned operations to convey selected information and
indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately
the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. The purpose of
psychological operations is to induce or reinforce foreign attitudes and behavior favorable to the
originator’s objectives. Also call PSYOP.
Raised Angle Marker (RAM)—A “tented” panel device used in marking the intended point of impact of
the drop zone that enhances drop zone acquisition.
Rate of Fall (RF)—RF is the vertical velocity, in feet per second, of the airdropped load while under full
parachute canopy. RF is corrected to a standard day sea-level rate.
Safety Zone Distance—Use safety zone distance only during peacetime personnel airdrops (excluding
HALO/HAHO). A distance established by agreement between the airborne mission commander and the
supported forces' commander subtracted from the DZ trailing edge to reduce the potential for off-DZ
drops. For peacetime personnel airdrops, the safety zone will never be less than 200 yards. Do not
compute safety zone distances for airdrops supporting unconventional warfare forces as defined by the
Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP) Annex E, or HALO/HAHO airdrops.
Sequential Drop—Two or more extracted platforms released on a single pass over the DZ. Each
platform, in turn, deploys the extraction parachute of the following platform.
Sight Angle—The angle, in degrees below horizontal, along which the aircrew member, who initiates the
airdrop release, sights a point on the ground. This ground reference is used in determining the initiation of
the airdrop release sequence.
Stabilization—Stabilization is the point in the drop sequence where descent is within 10 percent of a
constant standard day sea-level rate of fall. Normally, forward velocity has decreased to zero.
Stabilization Altitude—The altitude, in feet Above Ground Level (AGL), where stabilization occurs.
Stabilization Time—Stabilization Time is the elapsed time from load exit to stabilization. Computation
of Time of Fall Constant (TFC) also uses this factor.
Stick—Number of parachutists or CDS loads exiting one side of the aircraft in one pass over the DZ.
Timing Point (TP)—Any visual or electronic reference used to measure the beginning of the release
sequence. The timing point should be as close to the release point as possible for maximum accuracy.
Time of Fall Constant (TFC)—A constant in seconds computed during airdrop tests that compensates
for the nonlinear rate of fall from load exit to stabilization. This factor is used to determine drift effect
during stabilization.
TFC = ST - DQ
158                                                                        AFI11-231 31 AUGUST 2005


Towplate—A primary aircraft component used to control the equipment airdrop sequence. This assembly
allows for the transfer of force of the extraction chute from the towplate, connected to the aircraft, to the
airdrop load. In the event of an extraction chute malfunction, the towplate assembly allows for the release
of the chute without transferring the extraction force to the airdrop load.
Usable Drop Zone Length (UDZL)—Distance measured from the PI to the trailing edge (minus the
safety zone distance for peace time personnel).
Usable Drop Zone Time (UDZT)—Usable drop zone length converted to time in seconds. Subtract one
second for HARP computation. Minimum drop zone time is 3 seconds, regardless of DZ length.
Vertical Distance (VD)—The distance, in feet, a load falls after exiting the aircraft and prior to
stabilization.
Verbally Initiated Release System (VIRS)—VIRS is a method of positioning aircraft for airdrop by
verbal instruction from the DZC. Refer to AFI 13-217.
Visual and Verbal Signals:—
Green Light—Verbal command and/or aircraft indicator light used to announce the arrival of the aircraft
at the air release point. This action signals the start of the usable drop zone time.
Red Light—Verbal command and/or aircraft indicator light used to announce the end of useable drop
zone time.
Zone Marker—An electronic reference used by aircraft avionics to navigate to an air release point.

CAUTION: Combination drops will use the higher drop altitude.
NOTE: Minimum drop altitudes for HE using the 5,000 pound parachute release is 1000 feet AGL, or by
parachute type, whichever is higher.
REMARK: A-22 containers with 26-foot ring slot chutes airdropped below 10,000 feet MSL during uni-
lateral training will be rigged with non-breakaway static lines, and those airdropped at 10,000 feet and
above will be rigged with breakaway static lines. EXCEPTION: A-22 containers with 26-foot ring slot
chutes airdropped below 5,000 feet AGL during unilateral training will be rigged with non-breakaway
static lines IAW T.O. 13C7-1-11.
8.4. C-141/C-17/C-5 Aerial Delivery Ballistics General . The following charts contain ballistic data for
a variety of load and parachute types in use by all four services. The data represents average information
derived from aerial delivery test run by the US Army Airborne Board, US Army Natick Laboratory, and
the US Air Force Mobility Center (USAFMOBCENT). Where exact data is not depicted, interpolate
between given values. For heavy equipment, the exit times given represent an average value based on the
load being rigged approximately two-thirds aft of the bulk head. Weight ranges depicted here do not
supersede technical orders or rigging manuals. All weights represent total rigged weights.

NOTE
1. If the following criteria are not met, the minimum altitude is 1,000 feet AGL: (1) Static lines are used.
(2) Parachutes are equipped with anti-inversion devices. (3) When using T-10 parachutes, use established
exit control procedures. (4) When using MC1-1A/B/C parachutes, use alternating door exit procedures
(ADEPT). ADEPT does not apply to combat operations or special tactics personnel.
2. Plan minimum IMC airdrops altitudes at 500 feet above the highest man-made obstacle or terrain fea-
ture and spot elevation, or 400 feet plus one contour interval above the highest depicted basic terrain con-
tour, whichever is highest, within 3 NMs either side of the run-in centerline from DZ entry point to DZ
exit point. Not applicable to aircraft with a fully operational terrain following system.
REMARK: A-22 containers with 26-foot ring slot chutes airdropped below 10,000 feet MSL during uni-
lateral training will be rigged with non-breakaway static lines, and those airdropped at 10,000 feet and
above will be rigged with breakaway static lines. EXCEPTION: A-22 containers with 26-foot ring slot
chutes airdropped below 5,000 feet AGL during unilateral training will be rigged with non-breakaway
static lines IAW T.O. 13C7-1-11.
