                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This directive applies to all UH-1N helicopter aircrews. It consists of this
instruction; AFI 11-2UH-1NV3, Checklist 1 (CL-1); and AFI 11-2UH-1NV3, Checklist 2 (CL-
2). Use it in conjunction with aircraft flight manuals, Flight Information Publications (FLIP), and
applicable USAF publications. It applies to training, normal, and contingency operations to
reduce the need for any procedural changes at the onset of contingencies.
     1.1.1. HQ AFGSC/A3TH has overall responsibility for administration of this instruction and
     associated checklists. Submit suggested improvements to this instruction on AF Form 847,
     Recommendation for Change of Publication, through MAJCOM channels to AFGSC/A3TH
     according to AFI 11-215, Flight Manual Program (FMP).
     1.1.2. Throughout this Air Force Instruction (AFI) references are made to Major Command
     (MAJCOM) and Numbered Air Force (NAF) levels of responsibilities. Due to the diverse
     nature of the structure of UH-1N units, all references to a particular MAJCOM or NAF office
     is intended to mean that office or equivalent. MAJCOM supplements to this AFI will
     indicate if there is a different office of responsibility.
     1.1.3. For purposes of this instruction, the Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) is
     considered a MAJCOM.
1.2. Applicability. This instruction is directive to all personnel assigned or attached to USAF
UH-1N helicopter units. This instruction, in conjunction with other governing directives,
prescribes guidance for UH-1N aircraft. Crewmembers must have a thorough working
knowledge of all procedures applicable to their crew position and mission qualification.
1.3. Deviations and Waivers. The waiver authority for this instruction is the MAJCOM/A3.
When an operational necessity exists and time does not allow pursuit of a waiver through normal
channels, the OG/CC has one-time waiver authority to this instruction. Report all deviations
without an approved MAJCOM waiver to the MAJCOM/A3 within 10 duty days of the
occurrence. MAJCOM POCs will forward a copy of waiver or details of circumstances to
AFGSC/A3TH for information only. Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this
instruction except:
1.3. (AETC)Deviations and Waivers. AETC/A2/3/10 is the waiver authority for this
supplement unless otherwise specified (T-2). Send waiver requests through stan/eval channels to
AETC/A2/3/10. The operations group (OG/CC) commander, or equivalent, of the unit that
generated their supplement will handle waivers to supplemental guidance. Waivers may be
issued for a maximum of 1 year or until this supplement is superseded, whichever occurs first.
All waivers must be reviewed and renewed in 1 year increments to ensure their continued
validity. Units will file a copy of approved written waivers to this volume according to AFI 33-
360, Publications and Forms Management.
     1.3.1. For safety, aircraft commanders may deviate from this directive as necessary to
     protect their crew and aircraft if they believe strict compliance would jeopardize safe
     operations.
AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013                                                         9


   1.3.2. When circumstances require, this publication provides guidance for helicopter
   operations under most circumstances, but it does not substitute for sound judgment. If within
   communications range of command and control agencies, deviations due to unusual
   circumstances should be pre-coordinated.
1.4. Supplements. MAJCOMs, operations groups and units may supplement this instruction
IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. Units may supplement this instruction.
Items in this AFI delineating unit-level responsibilities may be addressed in a unit supplement. In
no case will extended guidance be less restrictive than the provisions of this or any other
publication without prior authorization from the appropriate MAJCOM and AFFSA/A3OF.
Forward MAJCOM supplements to AFFSA/A3OF, through AFGSC/A3TH for coordination
before publication. Forward unit supplements to the applicable NAF/MAJCOM representative
for coordination before publication. MAJCOMs will notify AFGSC/A3TH of any approved and
posted MAJCOM supplement to this AFI. If the MAJCOM supplement is not posted on the Air
Force e-publishing website, provide a copy to AFGSC/A3TH.
1.4. (AETC)Supplements. Forward unit supplements              through    Stan/Eval   channels   to
AETC/A3V for coordination before publication. (T-2)
1.5. Development of New Equipment and Procedures. Units desiring to use new or not
previously approved equipment, to include mission equipment, must obtain individual
MAJCOM, HQ/AFGSC and WR-ALC approval via AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal,
prior to testing and/or use.
 10                                       AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013


                                           Chapter 2

                                  OPERATING POLICIES

Section 2A—Command and Control

2.1. General. Air Force Global Strike Command is the Lead Command for UH-1N operations
and will coordinate instruction changes and dissemination of revised information. Individual
MAJCOMs may establish command and control guidelines in their supplements.
   2.1.1. The wing commander and subordinate unit commanders exercise operational control.
   2.1.2. A mission commander (MC) may be required to conduct specific deployment,
   employment, or redeployment activities in conjunction with contingency, exercise, training,
   or other operations. Designated by the appropriate command authority, the MC is delegated
   command authority to exercise operational control over assigned operational and mission
   support forces in order to attain specified mission objectives during operations and exercises.
   The MC is a direct representative of the designating commander. The MC is responsible for
   planning, coordinating, and executing the operation, and through the appropriate command
   and control system, directs mission support forces as required within the limits of the
   designating commander’s authority. It is the MC’s responsibility to take care of the details
   and the people involved in the mission.
   2.1.2. (AETC) The mission commander’s (MC) primary responsibility is to take care of
   mission personnel and any details required for the mission crew to execute the mission. As
   such, under normal circumstance, the MC should not be an active crewmember involved in
   flying duties. Waiver authority is the OG/CC. (T-3)
   2.1.3. (Added-AETC) The final decision to delay a mission may be made by either the unit
   MC or the aircraft commander when, in the opinion of either, conditions are not safe to start
   or continue a mission. Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the
   aircraft commander (T-2).
2.2. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE). Due to the wide
variation in UH-1N missions and operating locations, MAJCOMs will provide guidance for
operating in a CBRNE environment if needed.
2.3. Support to Civil Authorities/Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies.
   2.3.1. Military Support to Civil Authorities. Request for helicopter support by civil
   authorities will be handled IAW AFI 10-802, Military Support to Civil Authorities. Mission
   approval authority is the wing commander (or equivalent).
   2.3.2. Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies. In general, military units are
   prohibited by law from participating in civil law enforcement activities (this does not include
   SAR requests from law enforcement agencies). See AFI 10-801, Assistance to Civilian Law
   Enforcement Agencies, USC Title 10 Chapter 18, Military Support for Civilian Law
   Enforcement Agencies or consult with your Judge Advocates office for more information.
   Report all requests for assistance and coordinate all requests from civilian law enforcement
   authorities through appropriate command and control channels.
AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013                                                      11


   2.3.3. Approval authority to carry civilian law enforcement or medical personnel on Search
   and Rescue (SAR) or Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) missions may be delegated to
   aircraft commanders under certain circumstances. If the Aircraft Commander (AC)
   determines passengers are essential for the successful completion of the mission, and they are
   unable to contact their controlling agency for approval, passengers may be carried on the
   segments of flight requiring their presence. Leave a copy of the passenger manifest with a
   responsible person IAW AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
   2.3.4. Utilization of Civilian Law Enforcement or Medical Personnel. Civilian law
   enforcement or medical personnel may be required to perform duties at an incident site.
   These duties may include death determination or human remains removal.
   Local/international laws may affect mission prosecution and should be reviewed prior to
   deployment/pickup of civilian personnel. Units will publish any local restrictions and
   procedures. This may be accomplished in either a command or unit supplement to this
   instruction.
   2.3.5. Human Remains. Rescue personnel should not normally remove human remains from
   crash or incident sites. The decision to remove the remains from the site will be made solely
   by the local authorities. Except as per paragraph 2.3.5.1., do not commit resources to body
   removal until the mission approval and/or releasing authority (normally the Wing/Group
   Commander) has been informed of the request and has approved the use of resources. The
   AC is responsible for the safety of resources and should not jeopardize them for body
   recovery. The AC is responsible for compliance with all directions given by local civil
   authorities concerning the proper removal and handling of remains in that jurisdiction.
   Written authorization from the proper local authorities should be received prior to removal;
   however factors such as accessibility to the area, weather conditions, darkness, etc. may
   preclude the practicality of receiving written authorization from local authorities. In such
   cases, a verbal authorization may be accepted if followed by a written authorization.
       2.3.5.1. Exceptional Cases. In extreme situations where time is critical and
       communications are impossible, the AC may remove remains and deliver them to the
       proper authorities if given authorization from the appropriate civil official. This
       procedure is authorized only if conditions already make it impossible to obtain timely
       approval from the mission approval and/or releasing authority. Whenever this procedure
       is employed, the AC shall request and comply with all directions given by local civil
       authorities concerning the proper removal and handling of remains in that jurisdiction.
       Again, do not remove human remains without permission, or prior to positive declaration
       of death by competent medical authority. (See Attachment 2, Example Authorization to
       Remove Human Remains.)

Section 2B—Crew Management

2.4. Primary Crewmembers. Crewmembers occupying a primary position during flight must
be UH-1N qualified and current for the mission events to be flown, or conducting training/re-
currency for that crew position/mission IAW AFI 11-2UH-1N, Vol 1, UH-1N-Aircrew Training
or designated as a supervisory flyer IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
   2.4.1. During operational missions, training of non-current or unqualified crewmembers is
   authorized when under the supervision of an instructor in the respective crew position.
 12                                          AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013


   Exception: Aerial gunner (AG) instructors may train flight engineers and flight engineer
   (FE) instructors may train aerial gunners on events in common.
   2.4.2. Functional Check Flight (FCF) certified crewmembers maintaining basic aircraft
   qualification that are non-current or unqualified for operational/special mission items may
   perform FCFs.
   2.4.3. After completion of the Key Staff Course (see AFI 11-2UH-1NV1, UH-1N Helicopter
   Aircrew Training), supervisory flyers, as designated in AFI 11-401, may fly on all mission
   profiles listed in Table 2.1 with the exception of Emergency Procedures Training.
      2.4.4. Crewmembers not performing basic crew duties will act as safety observers to assist in
      obstacle avoidance during ground taxiing, confined area operations, and to reduce midair
      collision potential during arrivals, departures, and simulated instrument flight.
   2.4.5. Interfly. An interfly exists any time an aircrew is made up of members from more than
   one MAJCOM, or aircrew members of one MAJCOM are flying aircraft owned by another
   MAJCOM for operational missions. The OG/CC (or equivalent) of the unit possessing the
   aircraft is the approval authority for MAJCOM interflys. An interfly is a temporary
   arrangement between OG/CCs or equivalent to permit the exchange or substitution of aircrew
   members and/or aircraft between units to accomplish flying missions. Normally, interfly
   should be limited to specific operations, exercises, or special circumstances. However, it may
   be used for events of longer duration such as unit conversion to another model design series
   (MDS). Due to the wide variation in MAJCOM missions and UH-1N configurations, care
   must be taken when considering interfly requests. Units considering an interfly must
   thoroughly research the guest crewmember’s currency and qualifications, and carefully
   consider crew mix and experience levels. For intra/intercommand aircrew training, see AFI
   11-2UH-1NV1.
2.5. Minimum Crew. The minimum crew is the AC. The OG/CC is the waiver authority for
crew complement not defined in TO 1H-1(U)N-1 as noted in Table 2.1 The OG/CC must make
a thorough risk assessment prior to approving waivers to Table 2.1. During single pilot missions,
flight engineers, gunners and flight surgeons may sit in the left front seat when not required in
the cabin area. Flight engineers may sit in the left front seat during FCFs and maintenance
support. At no time will personnel not authorized per AFI 11-401 manipulate flight controls
which effect climb, descent, pitch, roll, bank, or yaw.
   2.5.1. If MAJCOMs have CEAs occupying the co-pilot's seat during flight, they will define
   training requirements, to include specific allowances and restrictions, in their MAJCOM Sup
   to this instruction.
   2.5.1. (AETC) If CEAs are occupying the co-pilot’s seat during flight, as defined in Table
   2.1 qualification will be in accordance with 11-2UH-1N, Vol 2 (T-2).

Section 2C—Passenger Policy

2.6. The UH-1N. The UH-1N is a utility aircraft and is utilized through a variety of mission
sets, including passenger transport. DoD 4515.13-R and AFI 11-401 contain guidance on
passenger airlift and orientation flights. Units must ensure compliance with these publications
for passenger transport covered by their provisions. The following guidance addresses passenger
transport not covered by the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R and AFI 11-401.
   2.6.1. Passengers may be flown on UH-1N aircraft during the normal course of exercise and
   contingency operations of the unit. MAJCOMs will detail the approval authority of these
   passengers in a supplement to this AFI.
   2.6.1. (AETC) Passenger approval authority is the Flight Authorizing Official or Aircraft
   Commander when the FAO cannot be contacted. (T-2)
   2.6.2. Direct Mission Support (DMS) denotes a mission where passengers are flown for
   specific purposes in support of DoD missions (e.g. aerial surveys, observation) where
   helicopter airlift is specifically needed to accomplish the mission. This does not include
   routine point-to-point travel of a passenger. Special Airlift Mission (SAM) passengers
   approved and tasked by the White House Military Office (WHMO) is considered a DMS
   mission. MAJCOMs will detail the approval authority of these missions in a supplement to
   this AFI.
   2.6.2. (AETC) Passenger approval authority is the Flight Authorizing Official or Aircraft
   Commander when the FAO cannot be contacted. (T-2)
   2.6.3. Restrictions. Simulated emergency procedures are not authorized with passengers
   onboard. Passengers will be restrained by the safest means possible while still enabling the
   supported passenger to accomplish their mission. PIC will ensure supported forces are given
   a safety briefing and are familiar with the mission profile and events before the flight.
   2.6.4. Manifests. Passengers will be categorized, manifested, and briefed IAW AFI 11-401.
   MAJCOMs will determine flight profile and restrictions with passengers on-board (publish in
   MAJCOM supplement to AFI 11-401), but must weigh the risk against the gain when
   exposing passengers to various flight regimes.
 16                                          AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013


   2.6.5. When passengers are in the cargo compartment, the cargo doors will remain closed
   during flight unless an aircrew member is also in the cabin. Unit commanders may waive this
   requirement if a valid need exists and the passengers are thoroughly briefed on cabin
   personnel and equipment security.

Section 2D—Communications Policy

2.7. Communications Policy:
      2.7.1. Primary Radio. The AC will tell the crew which radio is the primary radio. All
      crewmembers will monitor the primary radio unless specifically directed otherwise by the
      AC.
   2.7.2. Intercom. All crewmembers will listen to the intercom. Clearance is required from the
   AC prior to switching off the intercom. During critical phases of flight, intra-plane
   transmissions will be limited to those essential for crew coordination.         NOTE: Avoid
   discussing classified information on intercom. If classified discussion is necessary, ensure all
   wafer switches are in the Internal Communications System (ICS) position. Also ensure the
   Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) Mute Switch and Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR)
   Recorder Mute switch are on.
2.8. Instrument Calls:
   2.8.1. Mandatory calls for the pilot not flying during climb out/descent (The FE or AG is
   responsible for these calls if occupying a cockpit seat):
         2.8.1.1. Five hundred feet below/above assigned altitude and one hundred feet
         below/above assigned altitude.
         2.8.1.2. Five hundred feet above/below initial approach fix altitude or holding altitude
         and one hundred feet above/below initial approach fix altitude or holding altitude.
   2.8.2. Any crewmember seeing deviations greater than 10 degrees of heading, 10 knots of
   airspeed, or 100 feet of altitude will inform the pilot flying. Deviations from prescribed
   procedures for the approach being flown will also be announced.
   2.8.3. Mandatory calls for the pilot not flying the aircraft during non-precision approaches:
         2.8.3.1. One hundred feet above Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA).
         2.8.3.2. “Minimums” at MDA.
         2.8.3.3. Runway in sight. Call when the runway environment is in sight. Do not call too
         soon when obstructions to vision (such as fog, haze, low stratus clouds, etc.) are present.
         2.8.3.4. “Go-around.” Call at missed approach point if the runway environment is not in
         sight.
   2.8.4. Mandatory calls for the pilot not flying during precision approaches:
         2.8.4.1. One hundred feet above Decision Height (DH).
         2.8.4.2. “Land.” Call at DH if the runway environment is in sight and the aircraft is in a
         position for a normal landing.
AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013                                                          17


       2.8.4.3. “Go-around.” Call at decision height if the runway environment is not in sight
       or if the aircraft is not in a position for a normal landing.

Section 2E—Power Available Checks

2.9. Dual Engine Power Available Check.
   2.9.1. Perform the power check as near as possible to the same Pressure Altitude (PA) and
   Outside Air Temperature (OAT) as the operating area. Slowly apply collective pitch without
   drooping Nr below 97 percent until computed power or a limit (as defined by the flight
   manual, section 5) is reached. The engines must produce power equal to or greater than
   computed from the power available charts in the flight manual. If the engines fail the power
   check or Nr droops below 97 percent prior to reaching computed power or a limit, terminate
   the sortie. Perform a dual engine power available check for:
       2.9.1.1. Operations below 300 feet AGL (except when operating on routes depicted on
       published Federal Aviation Administration [FAA]/National Aeronautical Charting Office
       [NACO] Helicopter Route Charts)
       2.9.1.2. Non-Surveyed/Unprepared Landing Area Operations
       2.9.1.3. Search Operations
       2.9.1.4. Cargo Sling Operations
       2.9.1.5. Hoist/Non-Hoist AIE (Ropes)/Water Operations.
   2.9.2. Minimum power required for areas with a clear escape route is computed hover power
   for the intended hover height for the landing location. Minimum power required for areas
   with a restricted escape route is computed OGE hover power for the landing location.
   2.9.3. Consider that power available at the site may differ from power available in flight if
   temperature or PA differs. Reaccomplish power check if conditions change from worst case
   which will result in a decrease in power available.
   2.9.4. Comparing power available with power required determines power margin. This is the
   excess power available for go-around or unforeseen conditions (e.g., wind shifts, null areas,
   etc.). When the power margin is 10 percent or less, a second aircrew member will re-compute
   Take Off and Landing Data (TOLD) to confirm power requirements. The smaller the power
   margin, the more hazardous the approach. Extra caution must be used when operating in
   conditions that result in small power margins.
   2.9.5. Prior to landing, ensure that sufficient power to depart the planned landing site is
   available. Factor in any weight that will be added at the site (e.g., survivors).
   2.9.6. If sufficient power is not available for the approach, landing and departure, lighten the
   helicopter, locate a more suitable landing site, or abort the mission.
2.10. Single Engine Power Available Check. To accomplish this, ensure torque is below
single engine power available then gradually roll one throttle back to flight idle while monitoring
the engine instruments to ensure the other engine is able to produce adequate power to sustain
flight. Slowly apply collective pitch without dropping Nr below 97 percent until computed power
available or a limit (as defined by the flight manual, Section 5) is reached. If the engine fails the
 18                                        AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013


power check or Nr droops below 97 percent prior to reaching computed power or a limit,
terminate the sortie.

Section 2F—Aircraft Ground Operations and Servicing

2.11. Aerospace Vehicle Flight Data Document. Review the AFTO FORM Forms 781, ARMS
Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, before applying power to the aircraft or operating
aircraft systems. An authorized maintenance person, if available, or the AC must sign the
exceptional/conditional release before flight. Ensure the AIR card and DD Form 1896, Jet Fuel
Identaplate, are aboard the aircraft.
2.12. Engine Running Crew Change. Engine running crew changes require the following:
   2.12.1. One pilot will have seat belt and shoulder harness fastened during pilot change.
   2.12.2. The new AC will review the AFTO FORM Forms 781, aircraft weight and balance,
   configuration, and TOLD.
2.13. Fire Guard. A fire guard will be used, when available, for all engine starts. If a wheeled
extinguisher is not available, the fire guard will have a hand-held fire extinguisher readily
available. The fire guard’s primary duty is to assist the crew in evacuating the aircraft should a
fire occur, not fight the fire at the engine compartment.
2.14. Aircraft Servicing.
   2.14.1. Refueling Duties. Aircrew members certified in refueling may perform refueling
   duties. Crewmembers used as refueling supervisors/panel operators will comply with TO 00-
   25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding and TO 1H-1(U)N-2-1
   CL-2, Refueling/Defueling to max extent possible. At locations with refueling support,
   aircrews will not refuel unless extenuating circumstances dictate. When not directly involved
   in the refueling operation, personnel will remain at least 50 feet from the aircraft.
   2.14.2. Services Documentation.
       2.14.2.1. The AIR Card is used to pay for services at commercial Fixed Base Operators
       (FBO). These include aviation fuel, aircraft oil and fluids or other minor maintenance
       items. Charges incurred during this routine aircraft servicing generate a charge receipt.
       The aircraft commander is responsible for ensuring the receipt is correct and all
       appropriate signatures are obtained before departing the FBO. Log refuel information on
       the AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documentation Log, located in the aircraft 781 forms
       binder IAW AFMAN 23-110 V1 PT3, USAF Supply Manual Volume 1, and TO 00-20-1,
       Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policy and Procedures.
       The aircraft commander then ensures that all charge receipts are transferred to the unit
       document control officer (DCO) at the completion of the mission.
       2.14.2.2. Charges incurred for other services, including landing fees, aircraft de-icing,
       follow-me trucks, and other airfield related services might not generate a receipt that is
       given to the aircrew. If no receipt for the services is generated and provided to the
       aircrew, the aircraft commander will ensure the location and services performed are noted
       (AF Form 664 meets this requirement) and relayed to the unit DCO when the receipts are
       turned in upon mission completion. If a separate receipt is generated, turn it in to the unit
       DCO.
AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013                                                       19


       2.14.2.3. In the event the AIR Card is not accepted aircrew will use the Standard Form
       44 (SF44), Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, for payment purposes. The AF Form 315,
       United States Air Force AVFUELS Invoice, is obsolete. The aircrew shall complete the
       SF 44 and attach it to the merchant vendor ticket/invoice when the merchant also declines
       use of the SF 44 and uses its own invoice/receipt. Fuel purchases shall be documented on
       a separate SF 44 from ground services and other authorized products since the merchant
       must invoice Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) for the fuel portion of the invoice
       and the customer home station payment office for any non-fuel product and services.

Section 2G—Weather

2.15. Wind Restrictions. Discontinue flight when wind velocity reaches:
   2.15.1. Training/Exercise Sorties: Forty knots steady state.
   2.15.2. Operational Sorties: Restrictions will be in accordance with the flight manual.
2.16. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Training/Exercise Weather Minimums. Operational flights

aircraft. (T-2)
   2.17.1. For planned instrument flights in IMC, complete an instrument cockpit check prior to
   takeoff.
   2.17.2. Current UH-1N global positioning systems (GPS) are considered mission
   enhancement systems and are not authorized as a primary instrument for IFR. The GPS may
   be used to assist in maintaining situational awareness.
   2.17.3. Training Flights. Weather equal to or higher than published approach minimums
   (ceiling and visibility), but no less than 1/2 mile (2,400 runway visual range [RVR]) at the

       visibility is required if a copter-only approach is used at the departure airfield. Select the
       departure alternate using the following criteria:
           2.17.4.2.1. Departure alternate should be within one hour flying time.
           2.17.4.2.2. Weather enroute to the departure alternate must permit flight within
           aircraft limitations and comply with AFI 11-202V3, Selecting an Alternate,
           Helicopter criteria. The aircraft must be capable of maintaining minimum enroute
           altitudes (MEA) or minimum obstruction clearance altitude (MOCA), (whichever is
           higher) to the alternate if an engine fails.
           2.17.4.2.3. (Added-AETC) . The departure alternate prevailing weather must be
           better than or equal to the lowest published approach ceiling and visibility minimum
           (no lower than 1,200 runway visual range) and must be forecast to remain for 1 hour
           after estimated time of arrival. (T-2)
2.18. Life or Death Missions. Life or death missions are determined by the wing commander
(or equivalent) with concurrence of the unit commander and the AC. During life or death
missions, helicopters may take off if the visibility is sufficient to taxi to the takeoff area. Ensure
an appropriate course of action is available (and briefed) in the event of an emergency after
takeoff.
2.19. Adverse Weather:
   2.19.1. If adverse weather is encountered, take immediate action to avoid further flight in the
   hazardous conditions by either diverting or landing.
   2.19.2. No mission requires a helicopter to penetrate a thunderstorm. Flights may be made
   into areas of known or forecast thunderstorms if VMC is maintained and thunderstorm
   activity is avoided by a minimum of 5 nautical miles (NM). Flights will not be made into rain
   shafts beneath cumulonimbus clouds.
2.20. Fuel Planning.
   2.20.1. For all flights, plan to arrive at the destination with a minimum of 200 pounds of
   reserve fuel.
   2.20.2. For flight planning purposes, when visibility-only criteria is used or when destination
   weather may be unreliable, the fuel requirement for descent, approach, and missed approach
   will be no less than 250 pounds in addition to required reserve fuel.

Section 2H—Precautionary Landings

2.21. Forced or Precautionary Landings. The helicopter has a unique ability to land nearly
anywhere, providing the aircrew a tremendous safety advantage. If the crew becomes doubtful of
the helicopter’s airworthiness or encounters hazardous weather conditions, they should execute a
precautionary landing, provided the landing conditions are not more hazardous than the in-flight
problem. Aircraft security and accessibility for maintenance are secondary considerations to
AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013                                                       21


aircrew safety. Report all precautionary landings through appropriate channels as soon as
communications are established.
   2.21.1. Forced or Precautionary Landings due to In-flight Malfunction.
       2.21.1.1. Aircraft malfunctions must be investigated, corrected, and inspected by
       qualified maintenance personnel. Coordinate maintenance support via radio, telephone, or
       any other means available. The group commander or designated representative (cannot be
       delegated below unit Director of Operations [DO]) approval is required prior to further
       flight when the precautionary landing occurs at a location where qualified maintenance is
       not available.
       2.21.1.2. In the event a forced or precautionary landing occurs at a location where
       communications are not available, and the AC determines the aircraft is safe for flight the
       AC may authorize further flight. The decision to resume flight under these circumstances
       must be based on a thorough evaluation of all the hazards and risks involved.
   2.21.2. Precautionary Landings Due to Weather.
       2.21.2.1. If deteriorating weather is encountered during VFR operations, consider a
       precautionary landing a viable option in addition to course reversal, course deviation, or
       continuing under IFR.
       2.21.2.2. The AC may authorize further flight after a precautionary landing for weather.
       Make a reasonable effort to notify appropriate agencies of the precautionary landing and
       to determine additional weather information.

Section 2I—Altitude Restrictions

2.22. General. Conduct all operations at or above 300 feet AGL except when lower altitudes
are required for takeoff, departure, arrival, landing, operational missions, training flights in
approved areas, approved exercise missions, or when directed lower by a FAA/NACO
Helicopter Route Chart.
   2.22.1. Minimum en route altitude for unaided night is 500 feet Above Highest Obstacle
   (AHO) within 5 NM of the flight path unless directed lower by a FAA/NACO Helicopter
   Route Chart.
2.23. Low-level. Flight below 300 feet AGL is considered low-level.
   2.23.1. Daytime, low-level flights may be conducted no lower than 50 feet AHO along the
   route of flight.
   2.23.2. NVG enroute operations in a surveyed low-level area, or on a FAA/NACO
   Helicopter Route Chart, may be conducted no lower than 50 feet AHO when 20 percent
   Effective Moon Illumination (EMI) or greater exists. Operations are limited to 150 feet AHO
   when less than 20 percent EMI exists. To increase situational awareness, an operable GPS
   receiver should be available for NVG flight below 300 feet AGL.
   2.23.3. For NVG water operations, minimum cruise altitude is 150 feet Above Water Level
   (AWL).
 22                                         AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013


2.24. Obstacle Clearance. Prior to maneuvering the helicopter in close proximity to obstacles,
ascertain that the area is clear. Whenever horizontal rotor clearance is 25 feet or less, the scanner
will inform the pilot of the clock position relative to the nose of the aircraft and estimated
distance to the obstacle from the edge of the tip path plane (for example: Tree, nine o’clock, 20
feet).

Section 2J—Publications Required for Flight

2.25. Mission Kits. Unit commanders may supplement the minimum contents of the kit shown
in Table 2.2 Items carried by crewmembers or stored on the aircraft need not be duplicated in the
mission kit. A mission kit is required for all flights except on FCFs. During FCFs, a copy of the
TO 1H-1(U)N-1 and TO 1H-1 (U)N-6CF-1, is required on board. FLIP shall include coverage
for entire area of planned operations.

5. If infrared filter installed on searchlight landing light must be operational
6. IMC flight requires two operative ADI’s
   2.28.1. The final decision regarding equipment required for a mission rests with the AC.
   When the AC considers an item essential for the accomplishment of the mission, the AC will
   designate the component mission-essential and it will be repaired or replaced prior to
   departure. Acceptance of an aircraft by an AC to operate one mission (or mission segment)
   without an item or system does not commit that AC or a different AC to subsequent
   operations with the same items/systems inoperative.
 24                                        AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013


2.29. Radar Altimeter. Two operational radar altimeters are required for all low-level flight.
At least one radar altimeter must be operational for night operations (aided and unaided) below
500 feet AHO. Both radar altimeters must be operational for enroute NVG flight below 300 feet
AGL (this does not include terminal operations at prepared landing sites).

Section 2L—Restraint Devices

2.30. At least one pilot will have seat belt and shoulder harness fastened when rotors are
engaged. All crewmembers will wear a seat belt when conducting practice emergency
procedures. All occupants in the cabin compartment will wear a seat belt, authorized restraint
device, or parachute when doors are open during flight except:
   2.30.1. The AC may direct crewmembers to perform duties in the cabin unrestrained for
   brief periods when required to don harnesses, attend passengers, or change seats, provided
   doors are closed. Parachutists may change positions with doors open if parachutes are worn
   and the aircraft is higher than 1,000 feet AGL.
   2.30.2. For alternate loading of passengers and crewmembers, refer to AFTTP 3-3.H-1.
   2.30.3. The AC may direct crewmembers to perform duties requiring the use of a MAJCOM
   approved restraint device in lieu of a seat and seat belt when mission requirements dictate.
   Attach the restraint device to any tie down ring on the floor or to any bulkhead mounted seat
   belt ring as long as the seat belt is not simultaneously in use (does not prevent crewmember
   from attaching their restraint device to their own seat belt ring). Only one restraint device can
   be attached to a tie down ring at the same time. Do not attach the restraint device to cargo tie
   down rings on the bulkhead or ceiling. Adjust the length of the restraint device to preclude
   accidental exit from the aircraft. WARNING: An improperly adjusted restraint device may
   result in injury or loss of life.
   2.30.4. 580 ACSG/GFEAC (WR-ALC/LUHE at time of approval) approved the use of a
   Crew Restraint Cable (CRC) as an alternate attachment point for restraint devices. The CRC
   is a locally manufactured item. Instructions for the manufacture of this item may be obtained
   from 580 ACSG/GFEAC.
       2.30.4.1. The CRC is a cable routed through four D-rings attached to adapters connected
       to four ceiling mount studs. A bolt, nut, and pin arrangement connect the cable terminal
       ends. The CRC is only to be used by personnel as an alternate attachment point for
       restraint devices if it has been pre-flighted by a qualified crewmember. When in use, the
       CRC affords personnel more flexibility and maneuverability especially during AIE
       operations. The CRC keeps the restraint device off the floor and free of equipment,
       lessening the chance of belt entanglement.
       2.30.4.2. The CRC is installed by flight engineers or maintenance personnel according to
       Figure 2.1 The four adapters are installed on the ceiling mount studs at STA 82.0 BL
       11.00 LH, STA 82.0 BL 11.00 RH, STA 100.0 BL 11.60 LH, STA 100.0 BL 11.60 RH.
       The cable will be fabricated according to TO 1-1A-8, Engineering Manual Series,
       Aircraft and Missile Repair, Structural Hardware. Manufactured cables will have the
       date of initial manufacture and a one-time weight testing capacity (2,500 pounds)
       permanently marked on the forked terminal end. Reference TO 1-1A-8 for inspection and
       maintenance criteria. The cable is routed through the D-rings on the adapters and then
AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013                                                      25


       bolted together and pinned at the terminal ends. The terminal ends will be positioned in
       the middle of any of the four adapter assemblies. The CRC will be visually inspected
       each time the cable is installed and before use. WARNING: Do not use adapters if they
       cannot be manipulated to the snap-to-lock position.
       2.30.4.3. The CRC can support up to two restraint devices at any one time. The restraint
       device may be attached at any adapter D-ring and cable or by cable alone. Only one
       restraint device may be attached to an adapter D-ring at a time and only one restraint
       device may be attached to a cable side at a time. No restraint device will be attached by
       cable alone at the terminal end attachment point.

Figure 2.1. Ceiling Restraint Cable Configuration.




   2.30.5. If a valid mission requirement exists, commanders may permit Operational Support
   Flyers (OSFs) and Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) to be restrained with a restraint
   device. ACs must ensure that these personnel are thoroughly familiar with the use of restraint
   devices and are fully briefed on all pertinent safety considerations.

Section 2M—Dropped Object Prevention

2.31. During preflight inspections, pay particular attention to panels and components that
are potential dropped objects. All cargo/mission equipment inside the aircraft must be secured
prior to any aircraft movement. WARNING: Loose objects can become hazardous projectiles
during any violent maneuver or hard landing and must be secured to prevent injury to personnel
and/or damage to the aircraft.

Section 2N—Standard Configuration

2.32. Responsibilities. Standard configurations will be IAW MAJCOM and unit local
procedures (supplement or operating instruction). Each flying unit will publish diagrams and
mission equipment lists for each configuration used by the unit. Prepare a DD Form 365-4,
Weight And Balance Clearance Form F - Transport/Tactical, IAW paragraph 3.8 for each of
these configurations. Additional special mission equipment may be added at the option of the
unit commander. All equipment authorized for and installed on the aircraft will be categorized
 26                                         AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013


and managed IAW applicable Air Force Instructions. Aircraft will not be modified to secure
and/or install equipment unless authorized by aircraft technical orders or applicable Air Force
Instructions.
2.32. (AETC)Responsibilities. Standard configuration will be IAW unit procedures. (T-2)
2.33. Cargo/Equipment. Securing life support/medical equipment/medical kits with seat belts
is authorized. In addition, items weighing less than 200 pounds that require constant access, such
as navigation or mission kits, may be secured with seat belts. Secure cargo/equipment items not
requiring rapid removal during an aircraft or medical emergency with devices identified in TO
13C2-1, Cargo Tie-Down Equipment, and the flight manual. Do not modify tie down devices in
any fashion.
2.34. Deployment/Exercise Configuration. Every effort will be made to establish the standard
configuration(s) prior to deployment/exercise participation. In lieu of an exercise coordinator, the
mission commander will establish the standard configuration for each planned mission. The
configuration(s) may be altered to carry additional observers, ferry simulated survivors, etc.
Survival equipment required by MAJCOM or multi-command guidance will be included in these
configurations.
2.35. Deviations. Unit commanders may authorize deviations from the standard configuration.
Deviations from tactical configuration requirements are authorized at deployment locations
(including exercises) when the mission dictates.
2.36. FCF Configuration. Unit commanders may establish standard FCF configurations as
required.
2.37. Discrepancies. Document all standard configuration discrepancies using the AFTO Form
781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.

Section 2O—Management

2.38. Predeparture Crew Rest: Medical personnel called to duty for urgent SAR/MEDEVAC
missions with less than 12 hours of crew rest can perform life saving duties. Crew rest for Flight
Surgeons may be waived by the OG/CC, IAW para. 1.3. Because Medical Technicians are
Operation Support Flyers performing in-flight medical care, no crew rest is required. Medical
personnel will be placed on the flight authorization to perform medical duties only and will log
flight time IAW AFI 11-401.
2.39. Post-TDY Crew Rest. Crew rest normally begins upon the final return of an individual to
home station from a flying temporary duty (TDY) and runs continuously until completed. Post-
TDY crew rest is computed at the rate of 1 hour off for every 3 hours of TDY not to exceed 72
hours. Post-TDY crew rest is normally completed before starting predeparture crew rest for a
subsequent mission. Cancellations or delay of post-TDY crew rest is determined by the unit
commander.

Section 2P—Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC)

2.40. MEDEVAC Missions. Aircraft will not be used for routine patient transfers. Medical
evacuation flights may be operated to transport seriously ill or injured persons and/or to transport
medical personnel, equipment, or supplies under emergency conditions when other means are not
AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013                                                      27


suitable or readily available. Prior to dispatching a medical evacuation mission, obtain the best
medical evaluation from a qualified medical authority to determine the need for evacuation. This
evaluation is not the final determinant whether or not a mission will be performed.
   2.40.1. Medical Evacuation of patients contaminated with chemical or biological agents.
   Accomplish IAW MAJCOM guidance.
   2.40.1. (AETC) Medical Evacuation of patients contaminated with chemical or biological
   agents will not be accomplished by AETC units. (T-2)
2.41. Medical Assistance. Missions involving life-threatening injuries/illnesses require
immediate launch because any delays in reaching the patient/survivor further decrease the
probability of survival. Avoid delays whenever and wherever possible. The flight surgeons (FS)
and medical technicians (MT) will assist in emergencies and are in charge of the medical aspects
of the mission. ACs are responsible for safe mission execution and will not delegate their
authority/responsibility under any circumstances. Unit commanders should continuously
coordinate their local mission response criteria and requirements with flight surgeons and
medical technicians to avoid potential delays. To familiarize the flight surgeons and medical
technicians with procedures and the available medical equipment, encourage their participation
in training and operational missions whenever possible.

Section 2Q—Search and Rescue (SAR)

2.42. Mission Generation. Units must have a Joint Rescue Coordination Center (JRCC)
number prior to conducting an operational Search and Rescue Mission. This does not preclude a
unit from preparing and posturing for a mission while waiting for the JRCC number.
2.43. On-Scene Procedures:
   2.43.1. Perform a power available check IAW Para 2.9 prior to search operations.
   2.43.2. Ensure an emergency escape route is available and briefed. If the mission dictates
   flight below 50 KIAS, a crewmember will calculate and brief safe single engine airspeed for
   current conditions.
2.44. Altitude Restrictions:
   2.44.1. Operational Searches. Altitudes are determined by the AC.
   2.44.2. Training Searches. Any search training below 300 feet AGL must be in a surveyed
   low level area. Day search training can be accomplished down to a minimum altitude of 100
   feet AHO. NVG search training can be accomplished to a minimum altitude of 300 feet
   AGL. Night unaided search training can be accomplished to a minimum altitude of 500 feet
   AGL.
2.45. (Added-AETC) Alert Procedures. If applicable, alert procedures will be outlined in the
local unit supplement to this instruction. (T-2)
2.46. (Added-AETC) Standby Duty. Standby duty is defined as a period of time that a crew
may be required to launch on an anticipated mission for which a firm departure time cannot be
established. Aircrew members will be provided a 12-hour inviolate crew rest period preceding
the assumption of standby duty and must be allowed to remain in crew rest until called in for

                                 AIRCREW PROCEDURES

Section 3A—General

3.1. Aircrew Uniforms and Protective Devices:
   3.1.1. When reporting for flying or alert duties, all crewmembers will wear appropriate
   flying clothing (IAW AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program) and carry a
   set of ID tags on their person. Commanders will determine additional requirements
   appropriate for the terrain and climatic conditions.
   3.1.2. All crew chiefs and maintenance/logistic support personnel will wear Nomex flight
   gear when flying on helicopters. Civilian maintenance contractors must abide by local
   contract requirements.
   3.1.3. Personnel whose duties require them to be in close proximity to the operating
   helicopter require eye and ear protection. Note: this does not apply for quick loading and
   unloading of passengers and equipment.
   3.1.4. Aircrews will ensure hearing protection is available prior to flight. A crewmember
   will be responsible for distributing these devices to all passengers.
   3.1.5. Chemical/ Biological Warfare Individual Protective Equipment (IPE). IAW
   MAJCOM procedures.
   3.1.5. (AETC) AETC does not require Chemical/Biological Warfare Individual Protective
   Equipment. (T-2)
   3.1.6. (Added-AETC) Survival vest. Crewmembers will wear a survival vest on all flights
   outside the local closed traffic pattern. (For Kirtland formal training unit, the Aux Field, FCF
   area, and local ABQ instrument pattern are considered outside the local closed traffic pattern)
   Exception: Wear of the survival vest is optional with winter weight flight clothing if the
   combination of the survival vest and the winter weight clothing interferes with aircrew
   duties. Whenever the survival vest is not worn, it must be immediately available. (T-2)
   3.1.7. (Added-AETC) Helicopter crewmembers must wear anti-exposure suits on any
   preplanned overwater flight beyond autorotational distance from land when the water
   temperature is 60 degrees Fahrenheit or below. Refer to AFI 11-301, Volume 1, Aircrew
   Flight Equipment (AFE) Program, as supplemented, for details. (T-2)

Section 3B—Aircraft Commander Responsibilities

3.2. Aircraft Commanders are:
   3.2.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   3.2.2. Responsible for the welfare of the crew and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
   3.2.3. Vested with the authority necessary to manage their crew and accomplish the mission.
 30                                        AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013


   3.2.4. The final authority for requesting and accepting any waiver affecting their crew or
   mission.
   3.2.5. Charged with keeping the applicable commander informed concerning mission
   progress.
   3.2.6. Responsible for ensuring all applicable briefings and checklists are completed prior to
   the event.
       3.2.6.1. (Added-AETC) Accomplish all checklists with strict discipline using the
       ―challenge – response method. Emergency procedures checklists will employ the
       ―challenge – response – response method. (For example, the reader of the checklist will
       verbalize the challenge and the desired action; the person performing the action will
       reverbalize the action to be taken; the flight engineer is reading the checklist for DC
       generator failure and reads the first step as ―check start switch - off. The person
       performing the action would respond ―off.) (T-2)
       3.2.6.2. (Added-AETC) Before each flight, the aircraft commander (or the aircraft
       commander’s designated representative) will ensure all passengers are briefed in
       accordance with the flight manual. If additional passengers are added on subsequent
       sorties during the same day, the new passengers will be completely briefed before the
       flight. Briefings must include life support equipment appropriate to the flight profile
       available for passenger use. (T-2)
   3.2.7. Required to debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft and
   equipment. Will make the following entries in the AFTO Form 781A, when appropriate:
       3.2.7.1. Aircraft subject to salt spray when flown below 3,000 feet over salt water,
       except for takeoffs and landings.
       3.2.7.2. Aircraft flown below 30 feet above salt water.
       3.2.7.3. Hoist and rescue device used in salt water.
       3.2.7.4. Aircraft flown through Volcanic Ash.
   3.2.8. Responsible for conducting the pre-flight briefing as applicable and a post-flight
   debrief with both aircrew and the appropriate agencies immediately after the return of teams
   or aircrews from a sortie.
   3.2.9. Fuel Management
       3.2.9.1. Preflight. The AC, or designated crewmember, will ensure the pre-planned fuel
       load is on board the aircraft and will brief the crew on fuel loads that do not meet mission
       requirements.
       3.2.9.2. In flight. The AC, or designated crewmember, will monitor fuel transfer and fuel
       consumption and keep the crew advised of fuel status.

Section 3C—Flight Engineer Responsibilities

3.3. General. This section contains normal procedures for flight engineers not contained in the
flight manual and/or applicable Technical Order. If flight engineers are not being used for the
AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013                                                         31


mission, the pilot not flying will complete the requirements of this chapter. If an FE occupies the
left cockpit seat they are responsible for pilot not flying duties.
3.4. Flight Engineer Station. The flight engineer station is defined as the entire cabin area.
Due to the diverse mission of a UH-1N flight engineer, duties may be conducted from any
station in the aircraft.
3.5. Refueling. The flight engineer may be required to refuel when maintenance personnel are
not available. If ground support personnel are not available, the AC designates other
crewmembers to assist the flight engineer as required.
3.6. Aircraft Systems Management. The flight engineer will monitor aircraft systems during
ground and flight operations unless the mission dictates otherwise. Notify the pilot of all
abnormal indications and take action as directed.
3.7. TOLD (Take Off and Landing Data):
   3.7.1. In accordance with TO 1H-1(U)N-1, TOLD cards will be completed and briefed prior
   to takeoff. Whenever possible, TOLD cards should be completed prior to the aircrew
   briefing. Compute data applicable to the mission profile.
   3.7.2. During multiple takeoffs/landings, only affected parameters need to be recomputed if
   favorable conditions afford an additional margin of safety in all other areas (i.e., gross weight
   decreases due to fuel burn-off, while pressure altitude and temperature remain constant). Tab
   Data has been provided in TO 1H-1(U)N-1 to facilitate computing TOLD while in flight.
   TOLD may be computed in flight using flight manual charts or Tab Data contained in TO
   1H-1(U)N-1CL-1.
   3.7.3. The H-1 Mini-TOLD Card in attachment 1 (or MAJCOM approved equivalent) will
   be completed for approaches when power required is within ten percent of power available,
   when out-of-ground-effect (OGE) power is not available, prior to NVG or low-level
   operations, or at the discretion of the AC. If involved in NVG or low-level operations, the
   card should be filled out during pre-mission planning using worst-case data. TOLD data will
   be thoroughly briefed and will be readily available to the entire crew.
3.8. Weight and Balance:
   3.8.1. The AC, or designated crewmember, will compute crew/passenger/equipment off-
   loading or on-loading to ensure center of gravity (CG) and weight limits are not exceeded.
   These computations will address the maximum number of personnel/maximum amount of
   equipment allowed in the cargo compartment without exceeding CG or structural limitations.
   This procedure applies to all operations in which CG or weight limits may be exceeded as a
   result of personnel/equipment on or off-loading. A manual or electronic DD Form 365-4
   may be used. MAJCOMs must approve any electronic system other than the Automated
   Weight and Balance System (AWBS).
   3.8.1. (AETC) Forward alternate electronic system requests through Stan/Eval channels to
   AETC/A3V for approval. (T-2)
   3.8.2. Automated Weight and Balance System (AWBS). Use the most recent version of
   AWBS found on the following web site: https://awbs.hill.af.mil. Refer to T.O. 1-1B-50,
   Weight and Balance, for installation requirements. Use the transport side of the form.
32                                      AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013


 3.8.3. Use a DD Form 365-4/Form F, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F –
 Tactical/Transport, for each flight. The DD Form 365-4 records the weight, moment, and CG
 calculations for a specific loading arrangement on a specific aircraft to ensure the aircraft
 remains within its safe weight and balance limitations. These forms are prepared for use on a
 one-time basis.
     3.8.3.1. Standard Aircraft Configurations (Canned). Aircraft configuration encompasses
     weight, CG, cabin equipment/seating/personnel layout, and mission equipment (i.e.,
     FLIR, hoist, life raft, cargo hook, AIE devices, etc.). DD Forms 365-4/Form F may be
     prepared for standard aircraft configurations used by the unit. These canned forms are
     authorized when an aircraft’s weight, moment, and CG remain within specific limits.
     These forms (either computerized or expendable pad version) must be filed and
     maintained in both the primary and supplemental weight and balance handbooks. These
     forms can only be used for the aircraft and configurations they were designed/computed
     for and must be checked for accuracy at least every 180 days.
     3.8.3.2. Initial Takeoff Gross Weight.
        3.8.3.2.1. If the initial takeoff condition gross weight changes by more than 500 lbs,
        a new DD Form 365-4 must be used or generated.
        3.8.3.2.2. When initial takeoff condition gross weight does not change by more than
        500 lbs, then a new or corrected DD Form 365-4 need not be generated. Even though
        no written adjustments are required, the AC or flight engineer will calculate the new
        gross weight and CG and ensure limits are not exceeded.
        3.8.3.2.3. Brief the AC on the new gross weight and CG prior to take-off, as
        required.
     3.8.3.3. Zero fuel weight computations are required on the DD Form 365-4.
     3.8.3.4. Passengers. Item 13 will indicate the number of passengers in a given position,
     their weight, associated arm, and the position or station. Example: 2 Pax/360
     lbs/117.0/Pos 3.
     3.8.3.5. Cargo. Use the last cargo and compartment/arm/station on the right side of the
     form.

                                     NIGHT OPERATIONS

Section 4A—Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Operations

4.1. Ambient Illumination Requirements. Training will not be conducted with less than five
percent EMI.
4.2. Aircraft Lighting:
   4.2.1. Exterior lighting -- IAW AFI 11-202V3.
       4.2.1.1. An operable white light (landing or search) is required for all NVG flights.
       4.2.1.2. Position lights will be set to steady/bright.
       4.2.1.3. Use of one anti-collision light is permitted. NOTE: The anti-collision light(s)
       may be extinguished and the position lights set to dim, if it creates a hazard to the aircrew
       IAW AFI 11-202V3.
       4.2.1.4. An operable searchlight equipped with an infrared filter is required for NVG
       training flights below 20 percent EMI and is highly recommended for all NVG flights.
       4.2.1.5. (Added-AETC) Taping of exterior lights during NVG Formation is permitted,
       provided 360 degree visibility is maintained. (T-2)
   4.2.2. Interior Lighting/Configuration
       4.2.2.1. The only NVG cockpit modifications currently approved for use on UH-1N
       helicopters are: blue-filtered secondary instrument lights, NVG compatible Master
       Caution segment panel, NVG compatible peanut lights, NVG compatible flip filters for
       the Master Caution and RPM warning lights, NVG compatible filters on the overhead
       pilot and copilot map lights, NVG compatible bulb replacements for the fire pull handle
       lights, an NVG compatible filter that can be temporarily mounted over the Master
       Caution segment light panel, the chip detector caution panel, the fuel system caution
       panel, gooseneck lights (NSN 1680-01-230-0533) and any permanent/temporary
       modification that has been approved in writing by Warner Robins (SPO). At a minimum,
       all helicopters will be equipped with the blue filtered secondary instrument lights.
       4.2.2.2. Ensure critical information is not rendered invisible by excessive taping. The
       tape must allow enough light to be emitted to alert the pilot of critical information.
       NOTE: Use of lip or finger lights to illuminate gauges in lieu of secondary lights is not
       authorized.
       4.2.2.3. Over water flights. All cabin emergency exits will be marked by chemical lights,
       which will be activated prior to flight over water. The chemical lights will be placed
       inside the cabin compartment as follows:
          4.2.2.3.1. Center one light immediately above each cabin door.
          4.2.2.3.2. Attach one light to each window emergency release handle (when doors
          are closed).
 34                                         AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013


          4.2.2.3.3. Attach one light to the handle of each cargo door (when doors are closed).
          4.2.2.3.4. Attach one light to the life raft.
          4.2.2.3.5. Attach one light to the life raft tie-down release handle.
          4.2.2.3.6. Attach lights to the pilot and copilot’s emergency door jettison handles.
   4.2.3. Each crewmember will carry an NVG-compatible light source (flashlight, chemical
   light, etc.). Finger lights and lip lights do not meet this requirement, but may be used as
   additional light sources.
4.3. Night Approaches to Non-surveyed/Unprepared Landing Areas and Operational
Sites. Operations will be IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 3, this AFI, and AFTTP 3-3.H-1. Do not
leave flight altitude until the location of the HLZ has been positively identified. Brief and
conduct a site evaluation prior to the approach in a manner similar to day criteria.
   4.3.1. Adjust pattern altitude accordingly, but in no case lower than 300 feet Above Landing
   Site (ALS) on downwind.
   4.3.2. Establish final approach to commence at no lower than 300 feet ALS.
4.4. Site Selection for Training. Same as day criteria. Refer to AFI 13-217, Drop Zone,
Landing Zone Procedures, for HLZ dimension and survey requirements.
4.5. NVG Considerations.
   4.5.1. Flight planning is particularly important for NVG operations. Comply with all low-
   level flight planning requirements such as chart preparation, preparation of navigation log,
   determining minimum safe altitudes (MSA), etc. regardless of altitude flown. NVG
   operations with only a pilot and copilot must be conducted at a helipad/runway/ramp type
   landing area or non-surveyed/unprepared landing area sites meeting unaided criteria.
   4.5.2. Comply with the NVG preflight procedures in applicable NVG T.O. (e.g., T.O.
   12S10-2AVS9-2, Image Intensifier Set, Night Vision, Type AN/AVS-9). Do not fly with
   NVGs that fail to meet the visual acuity requirements. NOTE: When the FLIR Turret FLIR
   Unit (TFU) is being operated during NVG operations, the flight engineer is allowed to de-
   goggle in order to view the FE display and operate the FLIR system. The goggles must
   remain available for immediate use (i.e. adjusted, focused, turned on, and flipped up).
   4.5.3. If a primary crewmember experiences an NVG failure which cannot be corrected and
   no spare NVGs are available, other primary crewmembers may continue operating with
   NVGs provided night unaided criteria is used for the remainder of the sortie. If this situation
   occurs during a training mission, the sortie will be terminated. If this situation occurs during
   an operational mission, the AC must weigh the risk of continuing with a degraded capability
   against the urgency of the mission.

Section 4B—Unaided Operations

4.6. Night Approaches to Non-surveyed/Unprepared Landing Areas and Operational
Sites. Operations will be IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 3, this AFI, and AFTTP 3-3.H-1. Do not
leave flight altitude until the location of the HLZ has been positively identified. Brief and
conduct a site evaluation prior to the approach much the same as under daylight conditions,
AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013                                                         35


provided adequate lighting is available. Under no circumstances will a low reconnaissance be
conducted. Do not descend below 300 feet ALS until established on the approach. Prior to
making the first approach, determine wind direction. Forecast winds may be used when wind
direction cannot be determined otherwise. When using forecast winds, ensure an adequate power
margin is available in the event winds differ from forecast.
   4.6.1. Adjust pattern altitude accordingly, but in no case lower than 300 feet ALS on
   downwind. Throughout the entire approach, use the radar and/or barometric altimeter to
   maintain awareness of aircraft height above the ground.
   4.6.2. Establish final approach to commence at no lower than 300 feet ALS.
4.7. Site Selection for Training. In addition to AFI 13-217, the following apply.
   4.7.1. Sites will be selected where the vertical development of the surrounding terrain does
   not restrict the pilot’s option to execute a go-around, with minimum maneuvering, at any
   point during the approach.
   4.7.2. The obstacles/terrain within three NM of the site will not exceed 200 feet above the
   site elevation. Restricting the approach and departure route to directions that will avoid
   terrain or obstacles exceeding the above criteria satisfies this requirement.
   4.7.3. Eligible night unaided landing sites and applicable restricted approach and departure
   routes will be depicted on the AF Form 4303, Helicopter Landing Zone Survey.
   4.7.4. For sites without permanent lighting, prior to full darkness, make a visual survey of
   the site and position lights to outline the landing area. Check for obstacles, general site
   condition, and wind. This survey may be accomplished by other crews flying during the day
   or by ground party. After darkness, the survey may be accomplished by NVG-equipped
   crews.
4.8. Illumination Requirements for Helicopter Landing Areas. Helicopters on operational
support missions may be authorized by the unit commander to operate into and from unlighted
areas provided all available illumination is used. On all other missions, operations into non-
surveyed/unprepared landing areas or operational sites between official sunset and official
sunrise will be made only if one of the following conditions can be met:
   4.8.1. The area is outlined by discernible lights.
   4.8.2. The pilot can clearly see the approach path and landing surface (as would be possible
   immediately after official sunset or before official sunrise).
4.9. Landing Zone Lighting. Some type of landing zone lighting should be used to assist the
pilot in locating and identifying the landing zone and making a landing at night. When practical,
employ a standard landing zone lighting pattern. Landing zone lighting should:
   4.9.1. Be visible to the pilot.
   4.9.2. Identify an area free of obstacles and safe for hovering and landing.
   4.9.3. Employ three or more lights at least 15 feet apart to prevent autokinetic illusions.
   4.9.4. Provide orientation along an obstacle-free corridor for landings and takeoffs.
 36                                         AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013


4.10. Landing Zone Lighting Patterns. Since a variety of landing zone lighting patterns are in
use, the pilot should anticipate diversity in lighting patterns when participating in joint and/or
combined operations.
   4.10.1. The inverted-Y light system is an excellent way to identify landing zones. Lights for
   the inverted-Y should normally be spaced in compliance with Figure 4.1 When set up in this
   fashion, the inverted-Y provides visual cues to determine the correctness of the glide angle
   by observing the apparent distance between the lights in the stem of the Y. For example, if
   the lights in the stem appear merged into a single light, a shallow glide angle is indicated. If
   the lights in the stem appear to increase in distance apart, the approach is becoming steeper.
   Approach path lineup corrections can also be made using the stem of the Y. For example, if
   the stem points to the left, the helicopter is left of course and should correct to the right. The
   following guidance applies:
       4.10.1.1. The direction of the approach is into the open end of the Y.
       4.10.1.2. The touchdown area is outlined by the triangle formed by the three lights
       marking the open end of the Y.
       4.10.1.3. When set up properly, wind direction will be along the stem of the Y.

AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013                                                          39


   5.4.2. Slide landing training areas. Local slide landing training areas are used for emergency
   and normal procedure maneuvers (e.g., single engine). Minimum dimensions will be IAW
   UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design.
      5.4.2.1. The AC will accomplish the following:
          5.4.2.1.1. Brief the hazards of the slide landing area prior to commencing any
          maneuvers.
          5.4.2.1.2. Visually inspect the slide area for hazards and surface condition.
          5.4.2.1.3. If the visual inspection was inconclusive, test the surface prior to
          commencing emergency procedures by accomplishing a slide landing. Accomplish a
          slide landing with both throttles at full open to determine its slide characteristics.
          5.4.2.1.4. If the slide area is not safe, discontinue training or go to a suitable slide or
          hard surface area.
          5.4.2.1.5. Hard surface areas such as runways, taxiways, or ramp areas may be used
          if free of obstacles/hazards.
      5.4.2.2. (Added-AETC) Units must obtain a survey of all slide areas to determine
      dimensions (to include slope data) and soil/surface conditions (not applicable for
      runways/taxiways). (T-2)This survey will be kept on file in each unit that uses the slide
      area. The unit commander must certify slide areas annually (at a minimum) or when the
      condition of the slide area suitability is suspect. The certification will include:
          5.4.2.2.1. (Added-AETC) An inspection of the area for general slide landing
          suitability (not applicable for runways/taxiways). The area must be free of debris,
          obstructions, uneven terrain, and any other conditions that exist either on or near the
          slide area that could pose a hazard to flight operations.
          5.4.2.2.2. (Added-AETC) A depiction of the slide area that highlights size, slope,
          magnetic heading, location of known obstacles, etc.
   5.4.3. Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF). Units will establish procedures to ensure
   ARFF support is readily available during emergency procedure training. Aircrews will not
   accomplish simulated emergency procedures while operating at civil airfields unless
   authorized in a letter of agreement (LOA).
5.5. Autorotations.
   5.5.1. Wind Requirements. When steady-state winds are less than 15 knots, align the aircraft
   landing within 90 degrees of the wind direction; if steady-state winds are 15 knots or greater,
   align the aircraft landing heading within 45 degrees of the wind direction.
   5.5.2. Practice autorotations in excess of 180 degrees must terminate by power recovering no
   lower than 500 feet AGL.
   5.5.3. The initial autorotation for training/currency will be a straight-ahead autorotation
   accomplished by the instructor to evaluate aircraft performance. During instructor upgrades
   the instructor pilot candidate may perform this autorotation.

                                       MISSION EVENTS

Section 6A—Non-Surveyed/Unprepared Area and Operational Site Procedures

6.1. Non-surveyed/Unprepared Landing Area Procedures. Complete a remote site
evaluation when landing to a non-surveyed/unprepared or unfamiliar landing area. Only one
remote site evaluation is required during successive approaches when conditions are equal to or
better than previous approaches to the same area. The remote site evaluation consists of a high
and low reconnaissance.
   6.1.1. Specific parameters, required areas of evaluation, and techniques for conducting the
   remote site evaluation are contained in the AFTTP 3-3. Aircrew must comply with altitude
   and airspeed parameters. Minimum site evaluation requirements are listed in the AFTTP 3-3.
   Method of evaluation is at the discretion of the aircrew but should be consistent with
   techniques contained in the AFTTP 3-3.
6.2. Mandatory Calls.
   6.2.1. Mandatory calls for the pilot not flying the aircraft are:
       6.2.1.1. During night VFR descents, 1,000 feet above intended altitude, 500 feet above
       intended altitude, 100 feet above intended altitude, and intended altitude.
       6.2.1.2. On final approach, make advisory calls every 100 feet when above 300 feet ALS
       and every 50 feet when below 300 feet ALS. The advisory will include altitude, speed
       (indicated airspeed until below 30 KIAS, then groundspeed if available) and, at the
       pilot’s discretion, descent rate and power applied--in that order (i.e. “250 feet, 40 knots,
       sink 500 [feet per minute (fpm)], torque 50”). At approximately 100 feet, the pilot not
       flying will transfer advisory calls to the primary scanner by calling “door” (i.e. “100 feet,
       airspeed and sink unreliable, door”).
       6.2.1.3. Go-around if rate of descent exceeds 800 fpm with forward speed below 40
       knots during approaches.
   6.2.2. Mandatory calls for the FE/AG/Scanner(s) are:
       6.2.2.1. On final approach, after each advisory call, the scanner(s) will provide
       terrain/hazard clearance inputs (i.e. “clear down right/left”). At approximately100 feet,
       the primary scanner will talk the pilot down with standard terminology described in
       AFTTP 3-3.H-1. The secondary scanner (if available) responds appropriately with inputs
       for their side of the aircraft.

Section 6B—Low-Level Operations/Tactical Procedures

6.3. General. Flight below 300 feet AGL is considered low-level flying. Tactical operations
may consist of low-level flight, normal flight, or a combination of both. Minimum enroute
altitude will be at or above 50 feet AHO or as directed by MAJCOM.
6.4. Low-Level Flight Areas. Low-level flight must be conducted in a low-level flight area or
as depicted on a helicopter route chart. Specific geographical areas such as missile complexes
AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013                                                       41


and operational areas may be designated as low-level flight areas. The area/route will have
defined boundaries and meet the following requirements prior to any low-level flight:
   6.4.1. Established low-level surveyed routes or Low Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN)
   areas. MAJCOMs will establish guidance IAW AFI 13-201, Air Force Airspace
   Management.       NOTE: Missile Wing missile complexes are not considered LATNs;
   however, low-level flight is authorized in order to accomplish assigned missions/training.
   6.4.2. Helicopter low-level flight areas will be surveyed annually. Verify all man-made
   obstacles above 50 feet AGL (or commensurate with the lowest altitude flown within the
   area) and document all new man-made obstacles on the master chart and flight charts.
   Annotate the survey date on the master chart.
   6.4.3. If low-level helicopter flight operations have not been conducted in a designated area
   for greater than six months, a resurvey will be accomplished before any low-level flights are
   conducted in the area.
6.5. Charts:
   6.5.1. A master chart depicting the low-level flight areas will be maintained for flight
   planning purposes. Annotate all man-made obstacles over 50 feet AGL (or commensurate
   with the lowest altitude flown). Additionally, annotate any published low-level routes, no-fly
   areas, exotic animal farms, or other hazards within the boundaries. Master charts will be
   updated monthly using the Chart Update Manual (CHUM) supplement. The date of the
   CHUM update will be annotated on the master chart. Crewmembers should continuously
   scan for uncharted obstacles. When uncharted obstacles are found, temporarily suspend
   training and record appropriate information on to the aircrew chart (location and approximate
   height AGL). ACs will ensure this information is immediately passed to appropriate
   supervisors upon landing.
   6.5.2. Charts used for flying will reflect the same information as the master chart.
   Crewmembers will ensure the chart is updated and annotated using the latest CHUM. ACs
   will ensure a copy of the planned route is available at the unit.
6.6. Route Planning. Aircrews will review and deconflict low altitude charts for IFR, VFR,
and slow speed low altitude (IR, VR, and SR) training routes and annotate potential conflict
areas along the proposed routes during pre-mission planning.
6.7. Evasive Maneuvering. Evasive Maneuver Training. Maintain 100 feet obstacle clearance
during evasive maneuvers. If a break call is made below 100 feet, the pilot flying must climb
above 100 feet before initiating any evasive turns. Pilots will make crew advisory calls prior to
turns and will clear their flight path throughout maneuvering. If hovering, this does not preclude
turning the tail of the helicopter to mitigate the threat or minor heading changes during takeoff.

Section 6C—Formation Procedures

6.8. Formation Types/Maneuvers. A description of formation types and maneuvers is listed in
AFTTP 3-3.H-1.
   6.8.1. Safety Considerations:
 42                                        AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013


       6.8.1.1. Knock-It-Off Call. Any formation member may make the knock-it-off call to
       terminate maneuvering, particularly when a dangerous situation is developing. This
       applies to all phases of flight and all types of formation maneuvers. All formation
       members must acknowledge this call.
       6.8.1.2. Break Out Call. The wingmen must break out of formation when:
       6.8.1.3. Directed by flight or formation lead.
       6.8.1.4. When unable to maintain sight of formation lead or the preceding aircraft.
       6.8.1.5. When unable to safely rejoin or remain in formation without crossing under or in
       front of formation lead or the preceding aircraft.
       6.8.1.6. Anytime his or her presence constitutes a hazard to the formation.
   6.8.2. Types of Formation and Spacing Requirements. The formations listed in AFTTP 3-
   3H-1 are common to all UH-1N missions and are authorized. MAJCOMs may supplement
   this section with additional formations for unique mission requirements. Refer to AFTTP 3-
   3H-1 for descriptions and discussion of each formation type. In all cases:
       6.8.2.1. The minimum rotor diameter between aircraft in flight is one rotor diameter.
       6.8.2.2. The minimum rotor diameter between aircraft taxiing is two rotor diameters.
       6.8.2.3. When separated from the formation for any reason (e.g. a breakout), wingmen
       will maintain well-clear of other aircraft in the formation until directed to rejoin.
          6.8.2.3.1. Rejoins may be straight ahead or turning
          6.8.2.3.2. Maximum bank angle for turning rejoins is 20 degrees
6.9. Dissimilar Formation. Formation flights with dissimilar aircraft are authorized when all
participating crewmembers are briefed and are thoroughly familiar with the other aircraft’s
performance and tactics. Rotor disk (RD) separation will be based on the largest rotor disk
diameter.

Section 6D—AIE Procedures

6.10. Rope Ladder Care, Cleaning and Storage. Units will develop a program to ensure all
unit-owned equipment is tracked, maintained and serviceable. As a minimum units must ensure
compliance with current manufacturer procedures.

Section 6E—Hoist Operations

6.11. Unit-Owned Rescue Equipment. Units will develop a program to ensure all unit-owned
rescue equipment is tracked, maintained, and serviceable.
6.12. Training Procedures.
   6.12.1. Accomplish live hoist training at the minimum altitude required to accomplish
   desired training, but in no case higher than 40 feet AGL
   6.12.1. (AETC) Accomplish live hoist training at the minimum altitude required to
   accomplish desired training. Live training will be accomplished no higher than 40 feet over
AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AETCSUP_I 9 December 2013                                                       43


   an obstacle-free area or no higher than 25 feet above the highest obstacle directly below the
   aircraft. (T-2)
   6.12.2. Both radar altimeters must be operable for all water operations.
6.13. Exercise Procedures. Exercises are distinct from currency training. Exercises are
designed to add elements of realism not normally provided during currency training. The
following are special provisions for exercises:
   6.13.1. Any military member or DOD civilian may serve in a survivor role and ride the
   hoist. Personnel not familiar with AIE operations will require a qualified observer. This
   requirement may be met by lowering a qualified crewmember to assist the survivor.
   6.13.2. Select a clear recovery area to enhance speed and safety and to allow the helicopter
   to land or use the extraction device from as low a hover altitude as possible and/or practical.
   Altitude restrictions defined in para 6.12.1 do not apply to exercises. If a recovery is to be
   accomplished from a forested area, the foliage must be sparse enough to ensure the survivor
   will not be dragged through the branches. When practical, select areas with trees of a
   minimum height to decrease recovery time and provide additional safety for the survivor in
   the event of a hoist or other equipment malfunction.
   6.13.3. Other exercise personnel. Every practical effort will be made to recover other
   exercise personnel by landing. They may be recovered by hoist if the remaining range time
   prevents movement of these personnel to a suitable landing area, or when an extended period
   of time is required to reach a suitable landing area. These personnel will be briefed to select
   an area within a reasonable distance that will allow the helicopter to hover as low as
   practical.

Section 6F—Parachute Delivery Procedures

6.14. Deployment of Parachutists. Unit/mission commanders may authorize parachutists to
deploy from aircraft under their control. Personnel authorized must have a valid operational
currency, administrative, or training requirement. In addition, the personnel must be graduates of
an accredited armed forces parachutist course and possess aeronautical parachutist orders. The
AC or a designated representative will inform the jumpmaster of required qualifications. It is the
jumpmaster’s responsibility to ensure all participants are in compliance with these requirements.
For water jumps utilizing SCUBA equipment, personnel must be certified military SCUBA
divers.

Section 6G—Weapons Employment

6.15. Refer to 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, AFTTP 3-1 and AFTTP 3-
3. Units will ensure that detailed local weapons procedures are included in their local
supplement.
