1.3. 60 and 349 OG/CCs are the waiver authority for requirements originating in this instruction for
their respective groups. Coordinate waivers through respective Squadron Stan/Eval and Operation
Group Standardization and Evaluation (OGV) offices.
2.4.2.6.5. (60 OG) Superintendents, chief flight engineers, chief loadmasters and chief boom operators
will receive required evaluations from OGV flight examiners or higher.
2.4.2.6.6. (349 OG) Squadron section chiefs (ART and traditional reservist) will receive required
evaluations from OGV senior or secondary flight examiners or higher. Use of higher echelon examiners
must be approved by OGV in advance.
2.5.4. Use the current Headquarters Air Mobility Command (HQ AMC) Aircrew Standardization and
Evaluation Visit (ASEV) standards guide to ensure quality of the programs. The OGV programs guide
will form the core of continuity books and act as supplements to this instruction providing additional
OGV policy on implementing programs. Units are encouraged to tailor program guides as necessary to
explain their own implementation processes.
3.2.2.2. Squadron DOV will review the FEFs of assigned aircrew members prior to their first flight and
annually thereafter. FEFs will also be maintained and kept secure by the respective squadron DOV

Guide.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_TRAVISAFBSUP 20 JULY 2009                                                          3


3.2.2.4.4. The main DOV source used to obtain and track trend information is the Patriot Excalibur
(PEX) Stan/Eval computer software, which continuously receives inputs on AF Form 3862 data as
evaluations are processed. This aspect of the program is limited, however, and neither computes
percentages nor provides a means to track positive trends or any identified weaknesses unless assigned a
grade of Q- or U. This limitation has been brought to the attention of PEX software engineers and is
scheduled for future enhancement. Until that time, Travis units will continue to scrutinize PEX data,
specific remarks, and actual numbers sampled in order to make trend determinations for correction and
SEB reporting. Testing trend data is also tracked by PEX, enabling DOV and OGV to periodically
monitor missed questions as part of the MQF/SQB review process detailed in the Team Travis Testing
Program Guide. Finally, trend information may also be collected informally from squadron instructors,
supervisors, contractors, or anyone else in a position to observe aircrew performance as detailed in the
Team Travis Trends Program Guide and individual unit processes.
3.2.2.5. Supplementary evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202v2, paragraph 5.4. Additional
procedures for supplemental evaluations are contained in the Team Travis No-Notice Program Guide.
3.2.2.6.7. Additional SEB information can be found in the Team Travis SEB Program Guide.
3.2.2.11. The purpose of the Travis AFB local supplement to AFI 202v2 (AMC1) is twofold. First, it
addresses those paragraphs required by the parent instruction and MAJCOM to be supplemented locally.
Second, it refers to specific Team Travis program guides provide detailed instructions for the execution
of all Stan/Eval functions performed by both the 60th and 349th Operations Groups. These guides
standardize processes for all nine flying squadrons across both wings, provide program continuity, and
serve as the core procedural references for both DOV and OGV. Between the regulations and program
guides there should be enough detail so any individual can perform a given process when primary and
alternate program managers are unavailable. The program guides are maintained electronically and are
updated as requirements evolve, ensuring Travis Stan/Eval personnel always have access to the most
current guidance.
3.2.2.17.7. All OG/OGV flight examiners should evaluate required continuation training taught by on-
base agencies when attending courses as part of their continuation training requirements. Debrief the
instructor immediately after the class, and document the training using the OG/OGV Ground Training
Review Form.
3.2.3.3. (60 OG) Additional personnel assigned to OGV are designated secondary senior evaluators and
may perform pyramid evaluations to squadron senior evaluators.
3.3.2.10.3.1.1. Operations Group (R&C) Interview Procedures.
3.3.2.10.3.1.1.1. (60 OG) All Aircraft Commanders, instructors, evaluators and Aerial Demonstration
Pilots require an interview with the 60 OG/CC. The Operations Group Interview is not a mission ready
requirement. It is a onetime requirement and additional interviews for upgrades are not required. For
upgrading crew members, the interview should take place within 90 days of the Squadron R&C Board.
60 OG/CC will annotate the interview on a Memo for Record provided by 60 OG/OGV. Squadron
Stan/Evals will contact the 60 OG/OGV Review and Certification (R&C) monitor to schedule a group
interview. Additionally, each squadron will hand carry the FEF with the 60 AMW Form 163: Aircrew
Member Resume, SURF, ROP, ARMS Flying History Report and Fitness Assessment Report to the 60
OG/OGV for processing no later than three working days prior to the requested interview.

3.3.2.10.3.1.1.2. (349 OG) After squadron certification, all aircraft commanders, instructors, and
examiners require an interview with the 349 AMW/CC. The wing interview is not a mission-ready
requirement. The interview will be completed within 90 days after the squadron certification board. If
the interview is not completed within 90 days, the individual will revert to the previous crew position
until the interview is complete. 349 OG/OGV will annotate the wing interview on a Memo for Record.
Squadron Stan/Evals will contact the 349 OG/OGV R&C Monitor to schedule a wing interview.

weak areas or trends to senior leadership. No-notice evaluations may be in the form of a ground
evaluation, flight evaluation, or both. Available qualified crewmembers include those crewmembers
attached and assigned to squadrons at Travis AFB with the exception of OGV. 60 OG/OGV will report
the results at the quarterly (semi-annually for the 349 OG) Stan/Eval Board (SEB).
5.2.3.3.1.7. Squadron commanders are responsible for their squadron’s no-notice program. Squadron
commanders will ensure their squadron attains the minimum no-notice goal established by their
Operations Group Commander.
5.2.3.3.1.8. (60 OG) Squadron Stan/Evals will determine the number of available qualified
crewmembers for each crew position (pilot, flight engineer, boom operator and loadmaster) on the first
day of each quarter (do not include FTU instructors). Coordinate number with commander and or
operations officer and report to OGV by the fifth working day of the quarter.
5.2.3.3.1.9. Squadrons may credit no-notice evaluations flown by OGV examiners toward attaining no-
notice program goals. Do not credit Operational Mission Evaluation (OME) SPOT evaluations toward
squadron no-notice program goals.
5.2.3.3.1.10. 60 OG examiners will not administer no-notice evaluations to 349 AMW crewmembers
unless specifically requested by examinee’s squadron commander and approved by 349 OG/CC.
