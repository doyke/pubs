1.7. Phases of Training:
   1.7.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). IQT prepares MFIs for the IFS mission. Prior
   to beginning the contractor's new hire syllabus, all MFIs will obtain a Federal Aviation
   Administration (FAA) Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) certificate (either multi-engine or
   single-engine land). (T-1) (See Chapter 2.)
   1.7.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). MQT is required to qualify an MFI for the
   IFS mission. (See Chapter 2.)
   1.7.3. Continuation Training (CT). Training necessary for qualified instructors to
   maintain their level of maneuver and instructor proficiency. It provides minimum ground and
   flight training requirements. The CT program consists of theater indoctrination (TI) training
   (when required), the Buddy Instructor Pilot (BIP) program, and periodic ground and flying
   training requirements. The flying training portion of CT consists of maneuver currency
   requirements, event requirements, and ID sorties. ID sorties are flown to enhance instructor
   development while completing CT requirements. The objectives of the CT program are to
   increase instructional skills, enhance basic maneuver flying skills, and meet maneuver
   currency requirements. While individual maneuver proficiency is very important, it does not
   ensure instructors continue to develop their instructional skills and techniques. As such, the
   primary emphasis of the CT program must be continuous instructor development as opposed
   to simple maneuver proficiency.
1.8. Training Concepts and Procedures. Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC will
determine the level of supervision required to accomplish training. (T-2) If the mission
objectives include introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, a highly
experienced MFI or supervisor may be required. Note: An aircrew member who has been
certified as an IP and has 100 hours of PIC time (or 50 hours PIC time for a previous AETC IP)
can be considered experienced.
1.9. Training Records and Reports. The unit will:
   1.9.1. Maintain a training folder for each assigned MFI. (T-2) The training folder will
   include records of individual training to include, but not limited to, IQT, MQT, BIP, and
   certifications AF Forms 4348), in accordance with the RDS. (T-2) Source documents
   maintained by the contractor do not need to be duplicated. Note: A model electronic training
   folder can be found on the AETC/A3V SharePoint site located at:
   https://eis.aetc.af.mil/hq/A23/A3V/default.aspx.
   1.9.2. The SQ/CC will certify missions and events in which individual MFIs may participate
   by reviewing and signing an AF Form 4348 and the letter of aircrew certifications (letter of
   Xs). (T-2) The AF Form 4348 provides a permanent record and certification source for
   instructor certifications not attained through an AF Form 8, evaluation. Following signature
   on the AF Form 4348, records of training leading up to the certification may be removed
   from the training folder.
       1.9.2.1. For each certification achieved and listed on the letter of Xs, the unit will
       maintain documentation on an AF Form 4348 in the individual’s training folder. (T-2)

                                    AIRCREW TRAINING

2.1. Prerequisites. Personnel selected for duty as a MFI must meet the physical examination
and physiological training requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 1, before starting training. (T-1)
All MFIs must obtain an initial base clearance AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for
Flying or Special Operational Duty during in processing. (T-1)
2.2. Initial Qualification Training (IQT)/ Mission Qualification Training (MQT). The
contractor’s new hire training syllabus will be used to train all MFIs. (T-2) IQT and MQT will be
considered complete upon successful completion of the syllabus. Exception: MFI candidates
who don’t already possess a, CFI Single Engine Land certificate see paragraph 2.2.2.
   2.2.1. Once IQT/MQT is complete, MFIs will complete an AF Form 8, evaluation flown by
   a military flight examiner (FE) (see Chapter 3). (T-2)
   2.2.2. After completion of the AF Form 8 evaluation, MFI candidates who don’t already
   possess a, CFI Single Engine Land certificate will obtain their CFI Single Engine Land
   equivalency IAW Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 61, § 61.73(g) before
   completing the final syllabus certification sortie. (T-2) Student sorties will not be flown prior
   to completion of IQT/MQT and CFI certification. (T-2)
2.3. Advanced Certifications:
   2.3.1. Review, Final, Progress, and Elimination Check pilot certifications will be
   accomplished according to the IFS syllabus and documented on an AF Form 4348 in the
   training folder. (T-2) The letter of aircrew certifications (Letter of Xs) will reflect these
   advanced certifications. (T-2)
   2.3.2. FE certification will be accomplished and documented IAW AFI 11-202V2. (T-1)
2.4. Differences Training. Certification in additional contractor aircraft will be attained via
differences training and documented on an AF Form 4348 in the training folder and on the letter
of Xs. (T-2)
2.5. Loss of IP Qualification
   2.5.1. MFIs who fail a flight evaluation, allow an evaluation to lapse, receive a commander-
   directed downgrade, or go noncurrent in student instructional sorties or landings for more
   than 180 days will not perform instructor duties until a successful instructor requalification
   evaluation is accomplished in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 2 and Chapter 2 of this
   instruction. (T-2)
   2.5.2. If an MFI fails a qualification written examination, they must successfully
   reaccomplish the written examination before performing instructor duties. (T-2)
2.6. Instructor Requalification. The following provides criteria for requalifying MFIs who
have not performed instructor flying duties for:
   2.6.1. A period up to 225 days (180 days beyond the 45 day currency), place the instructor in
   supervised status and fly instructor development (ID) sorties with current and qualified
 10                                                           AETCI11-219 12 AUGUST 2014


   instructors until all expired currencies are updated and completed in accordance with Table
   2.4 (T-2)
   2.6.2. A period of 226 days to 2 years may complete a locally generated upgrade at the
   discretion of the FTG commander. The unit will develop an individual requalification
   program taking into account the instructor’s previous experience and currency for
   AETC/A3F approval. (T-2) Highly experienced instructors will conduct the flying training.
   (T-3) A mission evaluation conducted by a military FE will complete the requalification. (T-
   2)
2.7. Continuation Training (CT). Judicious scheduling of CT is required to develop
instructors and ensure training standardization. As part of the CT program, ID sorties are flown
to develop individual instructional skills and enhance basic proficiency. These sorties allow less
experienced instructors to learn and refine techniques from more experienced instructors.
2.8. CT Administration:
   2.8.1. Meetings:
       2.8.1.1. The SQ/CC will direct and supervise quarterly CT meetings for all assigned
       aircrew members. (T-2) The purpose of these meetings is to discuss, standardization,
       mission-related topics, instructional techniques, grading practices, and general knowledge
       topics. A Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM) topic or scenario should be
       discussed in each CT meeting, referring to CRM core concepts from AFI 11-290,
       Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program. (T-1)
       2.8.1.2. Attendance at CT meetings is mandatory. (T-2) If all the requirements of
       paragraph 2.8.1.1 are met, attending the contractor’s CT meeting meets this requirement.
       The unit will track CT meeting attendance as part of the go/no-go process for flight. (T-2)
       Individuals not available for CT meetings will read the meeting minutes, or be briefed by
       an operations supervisor before their next flight. (T-2)
   2.8.2. Requirements. ID crews will be matched by experience as much as possible
   allowing more experienced instructors the opportunity to mentor and develop less
   experienced instructors. (T-3) When flown, ID sorties will utilize SQ/CC approved profiles.
   (T-3) Profiles will detail the minimum events and/or currency maneuvers to be accomplished
   on the sortie. (T-3)
   2.8.3. Prorating End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle (31 Dec),
   the squadron commander may prorate training requirements for MFIs who were not available
   for duty. Use the prorating allowance in Table 2.1 to determine the number of months to be
   prorated based on each period of consecutive calendar days of non-duty.
AETCI11-219 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                      11

    2.8.4. Failure to Complete CT Requirements:
       2.8.4.1. MFIs who fail to maintain ground and/or flight training requirements will not
       instruct in the new training cycle until a review is completed to determine the cause of the
       deficiency and whether additional training is required. (T-2)
       2.8.4.2. The FTG commander is the review authority. The reviewer should consider the
       type and magnitude of the deficiency and the individual’s experience level to determine if
       the previous training cycle requirements must be accomplished or if additional training or
       increased supervision is warranted. Document reviews in the individual’s training folder.
       (T-3)
2.9. Theater Indoctrination Training. TI is not required when MQT is conducted locally.
However, TI sorties may be flown for local area orientation at the discretion of the squadron
commander. All sorties flown during TI may be logged as an ID sortie for the cycle in which
they are flown.
2.10. Buddy Instructor Pilot Program. Following TI training, the SQ/DO will assign each
new MFI to a highly qualified BIP sponsor who will monitor the new MFI's performance and
provide guidance in all areas of job requirements. (T-2) The BIP program should last
approximately 1 to 3 months. Prior to accomplishing any student sorties, the new MFI will
complete the ground training listed as “before flying with students.” (T-2) Remaining ground
training will be completed before the end of BIP. (T-2)
    2.10.1. Ground Training. Ground training will consist of the following: (T-3)
       2.10.1.1. Squadron policies briefing (before flying with students).
       2.10.1.2. BIP briefing (before flying with students).
       2.10.1.3. Instructor responsibilities briefing from the squadron commander (before flying
       with students). (In the squadron commander’s absence, the squadron DO will accomplish
       the briefing.)
       2.10.1.4. Commander's review or commander's awareness program briefing.
       2.10.1.5. Grading practices briefing.
       2.10.1.6. CT requirements briefing.

       2.10.1.13. Emergency Procedures (EP)/CRM briefing.
   2.10.2. Flying Training. The flying training portion of the BIP program will consist of two
   different kinds of sorties (BIP sorties and sponsor sorties). (T-2) All BIP sorties flown during
   the BIP program may be logged as an ID sortie for the cycle in which they are flown.
       2.10.2.1. Student Solo. Prior to the new MFI soloing his or her first student, someone in
       the BIP chain of command will fly one of the last four sorties before the student’s initial
       solo. (T-2) This sortie must not be the last sortie prior to initial solo. (T-2) Document the
       sortie in the new IP’s BIP training record. (T-3)
       2.10.2.2. Sponsor Sorties. The BIP or any supervisor in the new MFI's chain of
       command will fly sponsor sorties with the new MFI's students to ensure the students are
       being taught proper techniques. (T-2) The contractor chief pilot or assistant chief pilots
       may fly sponsor sorties if approved by SQ/CC.
          2.10.2.2.1. At least one sponsor sortie will be flown after the student has had
          sufficient exposure to be influenced by the new MFI's techniques. (T-2)
          2.10.2.2.2. Document all sorties and debriefings in the new MFI's BIP record. (T-3)
       2.10.2.3. BIP Sorties. BIP sorties are those flown by the BIP with the new MFI. All BIP
       sorties will be flown with the assigned BIP or any supervisor in the new MFI's chain of
       command. (T-2) The objective of these flights is to further develop the new MFI's flying
       proficiency and instructional techniques. At least one BIP sortie will be flown. (T-2) On
       the sortie, the BIP will discuss instructional techniques, planning profiles, student
       progress, grading practices, possible pitfalls the new IP should avoid, local flying
       policies, and common student errors. (T-2) Document all sorties and debriefings in the
       new MFI's BIP record. (T-3)
   2.10.3. BIP Program Complete. After completion of all of the ground and flying training
   events, the SQ/CC will certify program completion. (T-2) Place BIP training records in the
   MFI's training folder. (T-3)
2.11. CT Ground Training Requirements. Ground training accomplished during IQT, MQT,
TI training and BIP may be credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it
was accomplished. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 and Table 2.2 below establish aircrew ground training
requirements. For ground training prescribed by other instructions, MFIs must reference those
instructions for the latest requirement. (T-2) Refer to the Education and Training Course
Announcements (ETCA) web page at https://etca.randolph.af.mil/ for ancillary ground training
requirements. (T-2)

    on the AF Form 8 as: INIT INSTR/QUAL/MSN). (T-3) Periodic evaluations will be
    combined Qualification/Mission evaluations (annotated on the AF Form 8 as: QUAL/MSN)
    and evaluate both proficiency and instructor ability. (T-3) The examinee will brief the profile
    selected in advance by the FE. (T-3) As a minimum, the planned profile will include all
    required areas (R) from Table 3.2 (T-2) The FE will perform a representative sample of
    maneuvers for the examinee to instruct and evaluate. (T-2)
    3.3.2. The examinee will fly in the seat that best enables the FE to conduct a thorough
    evaluation. (T-2)
    3.3.3. To initially qualify as an instructor, a pilot must successfully complete a dedicated
    initial instructor evaluation. (T-2) Subsequently, crewmembers designated as instructors will
    be evaluated on their ability to instruct during all periodic QUAL/MSN evaluations. (T-2)
    FEs will act as a student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability.
    (T-2)
    3.3.4. The examinee’s publications will be checked prior to flight. (T-2) Required
    publications include the aircraft abbreviated checklist, in-flight guide and local area map.

3.4. FE Responsibilities:
     3.4.1. Prior to the flight evaluation, the FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the
     evaluation and how it will be conducted. (T-2) The examinee will accomplish required flight
18                                                           AETCI11-219 12 AUGUST 2014


  planning and furnish the FE with a copy of necessary mission data, mission materials, and
  maps (as required). (T-3)
  3.4.2. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. (T-2) Debriefs will include the
  examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified),
  and any required additional training. A squadron supervisor must be debriefed on all
  evaluations. (T-3) Additionally, a squadron supervisor must attend the debrief if the overall
  grade is Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). (T-3)
  3.4.3. Flight examiners (FE) will use the evaluation criteria contained in this instruction for
  conducting flight and emergency procedure evaluations (EPE). (T-2) To ensure standard and
  objective evaluations, FEs must become thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation
  criteria. (T-2)
  3.4.4. The FE conducting the evaluation is responsible for determining that the examinee
  meets acceptable standards of proficiency, teaching ability, knowledge, and skill in the
  selected areas/tasks. The FE makes this determination by accomplishing an objective that is
  appropriate to each selected area/task, and includes an evaluation of the examinee’s:
     3.4.4.1. Ability to apply the fundamentals of instructing (as applicable);
     3.4.4.2. Knowledge of and ability to teach the subject matter, procedures, and maneuvers
     in Table 3.2.
     3.4.4.3. Ability to perform the procedures and maneuvers in Table 3.2 while giving
     effective flight instruction (as applicable);
     3.4.4.4. Ability to identify and correct common errors (i.e., trim, throttle technique, pitch
     pictures, etc.) related to the procedures & maneuvers in Table 3.2.
  3.4.5. Oral questioning may be used at any time during the ground or flight portion of the
  evaluation to determine if the examinee can instruct effectively (as applicable) and has a
  comprehensive knowledge of the areas/tasks and their related safety factors.
  3.4.6. During the flight portion of the instructor evaluation, the FE shall act as a student
  during selected maneuvers. (T-2) This will give the FE an opportunity to evaluate the
  examinee’s ability to analyze and correct simulated common errors related to these
  maneuvers.
  3.4.7. FEs should, to the greatest extent possible, evaluate the examinee’s application and
  correlation skills. When possible, scenario based questions should be used during the
  evaluation.
  3.4.8. If the FE determines that an area/task is incomplete, or the outcome uncertain, the FE
  may require the examinee to repeat that task, or portions of that task. This provision has been
  made in the interest of fairness and does not mean that instruction, practice, or the repeating
  of an unsatisfactory area/task is permitted during the evaluation. When practical, the
  remaining areas/tasks of the evaluation should be completed before repeating the
  questionable area/task.
  3.4.9. When one or more required item(s) cannot be adequately evaluated in flight, they may
  be evaluated by an alternate method (that is, cockpit procedure trainer [CPT] or by oral
  examination) to complete the evaluation if in the FE’s judgment, the items can be adequately
AETCI11-219 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                    19


   assessed. The alternate evaluation method will be documented in the Examiner’s Remarks in
   the Comments block of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification. (T-2)
   3.4.10. FEs are required to fly student sorties and maintain all currency requirements
   (ground and flying) as outlined in Table 1.1 and Table 1.2. (T-2) If out of currency, the FE
   is required to regain all currencies IAW paragraph 2.15, prior to flying in the capacity as an
   FE. (T-3)
3.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). FEs will administer an oral EPE prior to the
flight portion of every evaluation. (T-2) FEs will use the evaluation criteria referenced in this
instruction for conducting the flight and EPE. (T-2) To ensure standard and objective
evaluations, FEs must become thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria. Units
will not permit examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade (Q-3) because of an
unsatisfactory EPE to fly in any aircrew position until the examinee completes a successful
reevaluation. (T-2) As a minimum, the EPE will include an evaluation of the following items:
(T-2)
   3.5.1. General knowledge to include aircraft systems, operating limits and local area
   procedures.
   3.5.2. Emergency procedures to include at least one boldface procedure.
   3.5.3. Federal Aviation Regulations.
   3.5.4. Stall / Spin Awareness.
   3.5.5. Wake Turbulence Avoidance.
   3.5.6. National Airspace System.
   3.5.7. Weight & Balance.
   3.5.8. Knowledge of Alternate Airfields and Diversion Procedures.
   3.5.9. Runway Incursion Avoidance.
   3.5.10. Temporary Flight Restrictions.
3.6. Flight Evaluation Grading Instructions:
   3.6.1. Tolerances in performance parameters are based on conditions of smooth air and a
   stable aircraft. Momentary deviations from tolerances will not be considered in grading,
   provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not
   jeopardize flight safety. Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
   3.6.2. FEs will use the grading criteria established in Table 3.3 and Table 3.4 to determine
   individual area/task grades. (T-2) Evaluation of an examinee’s performance shall be based on
   the examinee’s ability to satisfactorily meet the objectives of each required area/task. When
   individual areas are performed well above the grading criteria standards, make an appropriate
   comment stating performance and/or instruction was commendable in the Examiner’s
   Remarks in the Comments block of the AF Form 8. (T-3) FE judgment must be exercised
   when the evaluation criterion is subjective or the specific situation is not covered.

   3.6.3. Derive the overall flight evaluation grade (Q-1, Q-2, or Q-3) from the area/task
   grades, based on a composite for the observed tasks according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, this
   publication, and FE judgment. (T-1)
   3.6.4. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the examinee in order to
   successfully achieve the mission objectives. If the examinee receives an unqualified grade in
   any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will be unqualified (Q-3). (T-2) Critical
   areas are identified by "Critical" in the area title in Table 3.4 Grade critical areas as "Q" or
   "U." (T-2)
   3.6.5. The general evaluation criteria in Table 3.3 apply during all phases of flight (except
   for specific areas/events noted in Table 3.4).

3.7. Special Emphasis Areas.
   3.7.1. Examiners shall place special emphasis upon areas of aircraft operation considered
   critical to flight safety. (T-2) Emphasis should be placed on normal and emergency
   procedure patterns and landings, VFR navigation instruction, stall recoveries, and avionics
   procedures and systems usage.
   3.7.2. Although these areas may not be specifically addressed under each task, they are

       3.7.2.14. Low level wind shear avoidance
3.8. Completion of AF Forms 8. Evaluators will record aircrew member qualifications using
the AF Form 8 in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 2 and Attachment 2. (T-1)
3.9. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). The unit will maintain a FCIF Functional
Publications Library, as required, for visibility on relevant Air Force specific FCIFs that are not
applicable to the contractor. (T-2) The SQ/DO will be responsible to ensure all MFIs have signed
off all applicable FCIFs prior to any flight duties. The contractor will then ensure all MFIs, as
attached fliers, have signed off the contractor’s FCIFs prior to any flight duties. If technology
permits, these processes can be combined. The flying training group stan/eval will ensure the
contractor receives all applicable flying training group FCIFs so they can update their library.
(T-3)
   3.9.1. The flying training group stan/eval will conduct quarterly reviews of FCIFs. (T-2)
   3.9.2. The flying training group stan/eval will review group Special Interest Items (SIIs) in
   concurrence with the quarterly FCIF review. (T-2)
3.10. Go-No-Go. The SQ/DO will establish a squadron-specific go-no-go process IAW AFI 11-
202, Volume 2 that all MFIs will comply with in addition to the contractor’s go-no-go process.
(T-1) The SQ/DO will verify aircrew qualifications and currency IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2,
and will not release an aircrew if a Go/No-Go discrepancy is unresolved. (T-2)
   3.10.1. The SQ/DO, through the on-duty Military Instructor Liaison Officer (MiLO), will
   ensure all MFIs have complied with the squadron go-no-go process, to include squadron
   FCIFs. (T-2) If technology permits single point visibility of both the squadron and
   contractor’s go-no-go processes, the SQ/DO may delegate review of the squadron go-no-go
   process to the contractor’s Supervisor of Flying (SOF).
   3.10.2. Prior to flight off-station aircrews will contact their squadron supervisor/duty desk or
   command post for notification of any new information affecting their mission. (T-2)
