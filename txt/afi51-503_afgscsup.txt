about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR), AFGSC/JAO, using the
AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field
through the JA functional chain. This instruction is effective immediately upon publication.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This publication has been substantially revised and should be reviewed in its entirety.
2.1.1.2. (Added) In accordance with the AFGSC Supplement to AFI 91-204, Safety
Investigations and Reports, it is the responsibility of each Numbered Air Force (NAF) Chief of
Safety (SE) to ensure there are a sufficient number of Air Force Safety Center (AFSC)-trained
board presidents within their command to fill AIB requirements in addition to Safety
Investigation Board requirements. It is the responsibility of SE at every level of command to
maintain an accurate accounting of all AFSC-trained board presidents assigned to their
respective units.
2.2.5. (Added) ANG members appointed as an AIB team member for an AFGSC investigation
must be in Title 10 status while serving as an AIB team member.
2.8.1.2. (Added) For TDY expenses for AFGSC personnel, each unit will initially use their own
fund cite. AFGSC/FM will assign an emergency and special programs (ESP) code. The ESP
code will be provided to AFGSC/JA to track costs and enable “after the fact” reimbursement by
AFGSC.
2.8.2.1. (Added) To the extent practicable, transcription shall be accomplished by DoD-
employed court reporters, in addition to the appointed AIB Recorder. Requests for court reporter
assistance may be sent to AFLOA/JAJ, at afloa.court@pentagon.af.mil. AFGSC will be
responsible for funding any contractual transcription services should commercial court-reporting
services be required in lieu of, or in addition to, DoD-employed transcriptionists.
3.2.6.1. (Added) The owning NAF SE will confirm or update the accuracy of the list of their
AFSC-trained board presidents as soon as possible, but not later than the preliminary safety
message report of a Class A mishap involving an AFGSC active or AFGSC-gained unit. The
owning NAF Director of Operations (A3) or CV will ascertain the availability of potential board
presidents. The owning NAF SJA will ensure that potential nominees meet the requirements of
AFI 51-503, paragraph 4.3. Representatives from JA, A3, CV and SE should meet to discuss the
availability of potential board presidents if necessary. The NAF CV/A3, after obtaining NAF JA
coordination, will provide a list of members eligible and available to be the AIB president to the
owning NAF CC (or CV at the discretion of the NAF), who will nominate the best available
candidate. The NAF SJA will forward the names of the nominee and alternates for AIB board
president, along with their relevant qualifying information, to AFGSC/JA within 3 duty days of
the mishap. An information copy will be provided to AFGSC/A3. Requests for AFRC/ANG AIB
nominations will be requested through the appropriate Air Reserve Component (ARC) JA.
Communications by e-mail, phone and/or fax are encouraged to meet the time requirement of the
instruction. The nomination should summarize the member's qualifications and availability.
AFGSC/JA will forward the nomination, along with the Report on Individual Personnel (RIP)
(obtained by AFGSC/JA), to AFGSC/CC for approval.
3.2.6.2. (Added) Upon notification of an aviation mishap involving a fatality, AFGSC/JA will
immediately contact AFGSC/SE to review a current list of all Air Force pilot and navigator
AFI51-503_AFGSCSUP 1 JULY 2010                                                              3


general officers and general officer selects who have AFSC board president training.
AFGSC/JA, AFGSC/A3 and AFGSC/SEF will review the list in coordination with AFGSC/A1L
to identify those available officers whose rated experience best qualifies them to be a board
president for the mishap. AFGSC/A1L will ultimately determine the availability of candidates
assigned to AFGSC and will solicit assistance from the Air Force General Officer Matters Office
(AFGOMO) if two candidates are not available in the command. AFGSC/A1L will contact
AFGSC/CV, AFGSC/SEF and AFGSC/JA with the names of available candidates. AFGSC/CV
will recommend nominees. AFGSC/JA will separately forward the nominees list to AFGSC/CC.
3.2.6.3. (Added) AFRC/CC or ANG Director may nominate a qualified member to be the AIB
president upon notification of a Class A mishap involving an AFGSC-gained AFRC/ANG unit.
3.2.6.4. (Added) When faced with manning constraints (such as accommodating full-time and
part-time positions) the ARC may modify the process described in paragraph 3.2.6.1. However,
if the AFRC/CC or ANG Director chooses to nominate a qualified member as AIB President,
they must do so within the 3 duty-day time limit.
3.2.6.5. (Added) If the owning NAF CC (or CV) determines that there is no qualified candidate
available to be the AIB president, the owning NAF SJA will immediately contact AFGSC/JA.
AFGSC/JA will immediately notify AFGSC/A3. AFGSC/A3 will either identify a candidate
from the MAJCOM staff or task an alternate NAF to select a candidate. The alternate NAF CC
(or CV) will select the best available candidate and the NAF SJA will forward qualifying
personnel information regarding the nominee and alternates as described in paragraph 3.2.6.1.
3.4.4.1. (Added) Following a mishap, AFGSC/JA will contact those MAJCOM directorates
which are required to nominate technical advisors for an AIB. AFI 51-503 does not require
special training for technical advisors. The directorate may request nominees from any AFGSC
unit other than the mishap wing. The directorate may request nominees from the mishap wing
only with AFGSC/CV approval. The AFGSC Director of Logistics, Installation and Mission
Support (AFGSC A4/7) will nominate maintenance advisor members. The AFGSC Office of the
Command Surgeon (AFGSC/SG) will nominate flight surgeon members. AFGSC/JA will
nominate legal advisor members after coordination with the AFLOA/JACC (Claims and Tort
Litigation Division) Accident Investigation Board Field Support Center (AIB-FSC). If required,
AFGSC Public Affairs (AFGSC/PA) will nominate a public affairs technical advisor to the AIB.
The ANG Advisor to AFGSC/CC (AFGSC/CG) or the Reserve Advisor to the Commander
(AFGSC/CR) may help locate a reserve component technical advisor when needed, for mishaps
involving an AFGSC-gained air reserve or air guard unit, with appropriate command approval.
AFRC/CC or ANG Director may nominate a qualified ARC member to serve as a technical
advisor. AFGSC/A3 will nominate a rated technical advisor as needed. All directorates will
ensure their nominees did not participate in the SIB process and ensure nominees are not
currently assigned to an SE position.
4.2.12.1. (Added) AFGSC/PA, in coordination with AFGSC/JA, will prepare and staff a news
release or a response to query statement along with a proposed PA posture for AFGSC/CC for
approval.
4.3.8.1. (Added) The AIB President must send an original hardcopy AIB report, and if
applicable, one (1) additional hardcopy for each Next of Kin (NOK) that will be briefed, plus a
complete electronic copy to AFGSC/JA within 30 calendar days of receipt of Part I of the SIB
4                                                      AFI51-503_AFGSCSUP 1 JULY 2010


report. The convening authority’s SJA may approve extension requests totaling 14 days or less.
Extensions totaling more than 14 days must be approved by the convening authority.
4.8.1.1. (Added) The paralegal recorder should normally be appointed from the host installation
legal office.
8.3.2.1. In addition to the redactions required by AFI 51-503, paragraph 8.3., generally, redact
all official e-mail addresses and phone numbers.
8.7.4. (Summary of Facts) and 8.8 (Statement of Opinion): The following format shall be used
for citations.


    Citing to a single page: (Tab V-5.3)
    Citing to a range of pages: (Tab C-3 thru C-5)
    Citing to multiple sources: (Tabs N-4 thru N-10, N-20, V-4.2 thru V-4.4, V-4.40)
    Citing to a complete Tab (Tab BB-1 thru BB-111)


    When citing to multiple Tabs within a parenthetical, the Tab sections should be ordered
    from beginning to end of the Tabs section. For example (Tab P-3, V-4.2, BB-5)


8.11.1.2. (Added) The AIB shall forward a draft copy of the Summary of Facts, Statement of
Opinion and Executive Summary to the convening authority’s SJA for an informal review prior
to formal submission to the convening authority.
8.12.1.3. (Added) Color Copies. If the original AIB report contains any color photographs,
charts, illustrations, or graphs, then all required copies of the AIB report must include color
reproductions of these materials. Copies of the AIB report may not contain any black and white
reproductions of color photographs, charts, illustrations, or graphs.
10.1.7. Legal Review. (Added) The staff judge advocate of the personnel or property involved
in the mishap will provide to AFGSC/JA the details of any administrative or judicial action
contemplated and a summary of claims arising from the accident, by message, e-mail, or
facsimile.
10.1.8. (Added) Nothing in this supplement precludes initiation of disciplinary action by the
responsible commander prior to submission of the report by the AIB President or before its
approval by the convening authority, if such action is warranted and supported by competent
evidence derived independently of the limited-use information in the SIB report conducted in
accordance with AFI 91-204. Requests for early release of information from the AIB will be
forwarded to AFGSC/JA, in accordance with AFI 51-503, paragraph 7.2.
10.10.10. (Added) The AIB board president may identify DoD organizations who have an
official need for an approved copy of the AIB report. However, if the AIB President expands the
distribution list for the approved AIB report, AFGSC/JA may require the AIB President to
provide additional copies beyond the required copies required under paragraph 4.3.8.1. of this
Supplement.
AFI51-503_AFGSCSUP 1 JULY 2010                                                                5


10.11.3.1. (Added) Public Affairs officers receiving news media requests for an accident
investigation report should advise requesters that the summary of facts often contains sufficient
data to meet media needs and that media representatives may request this information, at their
option, instead of the entire voluminous report. Forward any media requests for information to
AFGSC/PA.
10.11.3.2. (Added) AFGSC/PA will coordinate with AFGSC/JA on a proposed press release or
Response to Query statement as well as associated public affairs products/guidance to assist with
potential media interest related to the AIB final report. Any news media requests for additional
information or clarification of material in an accident investigation report received by a local
Public Affairs office will be forwarded with a recommended coordinated response to
AFGSC/PA for staffing and response/releases of information. AFGSC/PA, through AFGSC/JA,
will obtain approval from the convening authority, where appropriate, prior to release of the
response.
10.11.3.3. (Added) Requests for a copy of the investigation (to include those from the news
media) citing the FOIA, will be forwarded to the AFGSC Command FOIA Office
(AFGSC/A6OK-FOIA) for processing and direct response.
